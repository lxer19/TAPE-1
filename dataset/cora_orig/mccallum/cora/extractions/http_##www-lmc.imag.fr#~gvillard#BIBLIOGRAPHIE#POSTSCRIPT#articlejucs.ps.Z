Title: Global Error Visualization  
Author: R. Aid, L. Testard, G. Villard 
Address: LMC/IMAG,  
Affiliation: (Laboratoire  
Abstract: A classical global error estimation technique is used together with an interactive visualization software to validate numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations in the complex field. Examples showing how a modification of the integration path can help to reduce the absolute value of the global error committed by the integration process are provided. Key Words: Ordinary Differential Equations, numerical methods, Richardson extrapolation, computer arithmetic, visualization.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, it is well-known that such a control is not in general possible due to the instability factors of the ODE ([SW76] and [Sha94], pp 76-78 for a comment on Airy's equation) and the limited arithmetic precision of computers <ref> [AL97] </ref>. Nevertheless, using a global error estimation technique together with an interactive visualization tool of the families of solutions, it is possible to assess the 1 whole flow to stay within the range of a singled fixed tolerance by modifying the integration parameters (integration path, initial conditions, tolerances). <p> + O (h p+1 ): And, we get directly : R i := 2i 1 These are available on a colour plate page 9. 2 A large number of numerical tests have shown that Richardson's estima-tor behaves well as long as it is used away from the maximum possible precision <ref> [AL97] </ref>. This quantity depends both on the equation which is to be solved and on the precision arithmetic.

Reference-contexts: The solutions resulting from integrations of a complex ODE are elements of C 2 , and need four dimensions for their visualization. In this particular case, we can nevertheless use a visualization technique derived from the extended phase portraits <ref> [BO78] </ref>. This visualization technique provides a way to visualize a group of solutions, specified by different initial conditions or by different values of a parameter. <p> + if 2 (t; y 1 ; y 2 ); we obtain a 2 fi 2 real dynamical system 8 &gt; &gt; : dt dy 2 = f 2 (t; y 1 ; y 2 ): 4 The solutions of this dynamical system can be visualized on a phase por-trait <ref> [BO78] </ref>. But this dynamical system is generally not autonomous, even if equation (1) was autonomous, and as a consequence different solution curves (issued from different initial conditions) can intersect, and the interpretation of the phase portrait can be obscured.

Reference-contexts: The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the problem of estimating the global error during numerical integrations of ODE's. Our experiments will be based on Richardson extrapolation <ref> [Hen62] </ref>. Relying on this estimation, the visualization method described in x3, will enable users to study the regions of the flow where the global error is out of the range of the tolerance and to compute once again the corresponding solutions.

Reference-contexts: The code then guarantees that this estimation will be made smaller than the given tolerance. The justification of this very classical approach, is that it leads to a global error the "true error" proportional to the tolerance <ref> [Ste80, Hig91] </ref>. As a result, it is then expected that if the tolerance is small, the solution will have some significant figures of the exact solution.

Reference-contexts: This quantity depends both on the equation which is to be solved and on the precision arithmetic. To give an idea of this phenomenon, the Figure 1 shows the behavior of the global error and R i using DOPRI5 (4) <ref> [HNW87] </ref> when the tolerance varies on the real ODE: y 0 = 10 (y x 2 ); on [0; 2]. Its solution is y (x) = 0:02 + 0:2 x + x 2 . This is a very unstable problem.

Reference-contexts: We will thus assume that we can visualize quantities embedded in R 3 fiI, where I is a finite interval which may be coded by a colour formalism <ref> [Ric88] </ref>. The solutions resulting from integrations of a complex ODE are elements of C 2 , and need four dimensions for their visualization. In this particular case, we can nevertheless use a visualization technique derived from the extended phase portraits [BO78].

Reference-contexts: A global control of the integration would be of great help. Unfortunately, it is well-known that such a control is not in general possible due to the instability factors of the ODE ([SW76] and <ref> [Sha94] </ref>, pp 76-78 for a comment on Airy's equation) and the limited arithmetic precision of computers [AL97].

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the global error is generally not significant on account of its values, but its variations and localization are attached to a given quantity, such as the solution itself, and end-users who want to visualize such quantities will generally be dealing with these two problems. The Ganj graphical environment <ref> [Tes97] </ref> that we have developed in this context, implements some key features to handle these questions. From a global point of view, human perception is limited to four dimensions: the classical three dimensions of space, plus additional data such as colours of points in the three-dimensional space.
