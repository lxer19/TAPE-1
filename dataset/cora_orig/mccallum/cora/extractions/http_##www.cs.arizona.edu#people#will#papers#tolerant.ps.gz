Reference-contexts: Let P be a predicate defined on O. For P 2 O, define P-tolerance (P ) = supf* j 8Q 2 O if ffi (P; Q) * then P (Q)g This definition is a restatement of the definition of tolerance given in <ref> [2, 3, 1] </ref>. As an example of the preceding definition, we rephrase (and make precise) the problem of finding the most convex n-gon within a given finite circle C. Let O be the set of n-gons, each specified by an n-tuple of vertices (points in &lt; 2 ).

Reference-contexts: This paper shows that our intuition is correct. Abellanas et al. pose this problem as one of a host of problems which involve the tolerance of a geometric object <ref> [2] </ref>. The tolerance of an object measures its ability to withstand perturbation and maintain some property. Perturbation has been studied as a method for handling degeneracies in an algorithm's input or as a way to quantify and control computational errors [4, 5, 6]. <p> Let P be a predicate defined on O. For P 2 O, define P-tolerance (P ) = supf* j 8Q 2 O if ffi (P; Q) * then P (Q)g This definition is a restatement of the definition of tolerance given in <ref> [2, 3, 1] </ref>. As an example of the preceding definition, we rephrase (and make precise) the problem of finding the most convex n-gon within a given finite circle C. Let O be the set of n-gons, each specified by an n-tuple of vertices (points in &lt; 2 ). <p> to R and has strictly greater perimeter, R C has strictly greater tolerance than P . 2 3 Open Problems There is a nearly endless supply of interesting open problems of the form "What is the object within O " K whose P-tolerance is maximum?" Two such problems posed in <ref> [2] </ref> are to find the set of n points within the unit disc whose Delaunay triangulation is most tolerant, and to find the n-gon within the unit disc which is "most simple," i.e. farthest from crossing itself. <p> Alternatively, one could follow the approach presented in this paper and ask for the "smallest" object in O with P-tolerance equal to *. Other interesting questions involve designing algorithms to calculate the P-tolerance of a given object. (See <ref> [2] </ref> for a glimpse of what is known.) 4 Acknowledgments I thank Paco Gomez for bringing the problem to my attention.
