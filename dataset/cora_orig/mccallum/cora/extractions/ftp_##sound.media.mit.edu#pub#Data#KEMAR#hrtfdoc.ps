Abstract: An extensive set of head-related transfer function (HRTF 1 ) measurements of a KEMAR dummy head microphone has recently been completed. The measurements consist of the left and right ear impulse responses from a Realistic Optimus Pro 7 loudspeaker mounted 1.4 meters from the KEMAR. Maximum length (ML) pseudo-random binary sequences were used to obtain the impulse responses at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. In total, 710 different positions were sampled at elevations from -40 degrees to +90 degrees. Also measured were the impulse response of the speaker in free field and several headphones placed on the KEMAR. This data is being made available to the research community on the Internet via anonymous FTP and the World Wide

Reference-contexts: The inverse filter was 4 obtained by computing the inverse DFT of this spectrum. A minimum phase version of this inverse filter was also computed using the real cepstrum (see <ref> [1] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: At each elevation, a full 360 degrees of azimuth was sampled in equal sized increments. The increment sizes were chosen to maintain approximately 5 degree great-circle increments.

Reference-contexts: It is necessary either to use longer ML sequences or to average the reponses resulting from different ML sequences (i.e. from different masks) to reduce noise caused by nonlinearities (see <ref> [3] </ref>). Time aliasing can be eliminated by using ML sequences which are longer than the reverberation time of the measurement space. Since the measurements were done in an anechoic chamber and the ML sequences were sufficiently long, time aliasing was not a problem.
