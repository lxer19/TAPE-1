Abstract: The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we propose new variants for the primal-dual steepest descent algorithm as one in the family of primal-dual projected gradient algorithms developed by Zhu and Rockafellar [1] for large-scale extended linear-quadratic programming. The variants include a second update scheme for the iterates, where the primal-dual feedback is arranged in a new pattern, as well as alternatives for the "perfect line search" in the original version of [1]. Secondly, we prove new linear convergence results for all these variants of the algorithm, including the original version as a special case, without the additional assumptions used in [1]. For the variants with the second update scheme, a much sharper estimation for the rate of convergence is obtained aws a result of the new primal-dual feedback pattern.
