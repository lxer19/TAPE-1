Title: On the Chronometry and Metrology of Computer Network Timescales and their Application to the Network
Author: David L. Mills 
Keyword: network clock synchronization, standard time distribution, timescale coordination, leap seconds, Network Time Protocol.  
Affiliation: Electrical Engineering Department University of Delaware  
Abstract: This paper summarizes issues in computer network timekeeping with respect to the Network Time Protocol, which is used to synchronize time in many of the hosts and gateways of the Internet. It describes the methods used to coordinate and disseminate international time services and how they are incorporated into NTP time servers. It discusses the hazards on reckoning NTP dates with the conventional civil calendar and a standard method for numbering the days. Finally, the paper describes the NTP timescale, its mapping to conventional civil time and date and its interpretation of leap seconds.

Reference-contexts: The industry has agreed on a classification of clock oscillators as a function of minimum accuracy, minimum stability and other factors <ref> [ALL74] </ref>. There are three factors which determine the classification: stability, jitter and wander. Stability refers to the systematic variation of frequency with time and is synonymous with aging, drift, trends, etc. <p> In 1967 the standard second was redefined as 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium-133 atom <ref> [ALL74] </ref>. Prior to 0 h 1 January 1972 national frequency standards were occasionally corrected to agree with astronomical observations.

Reference-contexts: For all types of oscillators the stability column shows the maximum variation in frequency per day due to circuit noise and environmental factors. As the telephone networks of the world are evolving rapidly to digital technology, consideration should be given to the methods used for synchronization in digital networks <ref> [BEL86] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Evolution of the Calendar The calendar systems used in the ancient world reflect the agricultural, political and ritual needs characteristic of the societies in which they flourished. Astronomical observations to establish the winter and summer solstices were in use three to four millennia ago <ref> [CAL86] </ref>. By the 14th century BC the Shang Chinese had established the solar year as 365.25 days and the lunar month as 29.5 days.

Reference-contexts: Network Time Protocol The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used by Internet time servers and their peers to synchronize clocks, as well as automatically organize and maintain the time synchronization subnet itself. It is evolved from the Time Protocol [POS83] and the ICMP Timestamp Message <ref> [DOD81a] </ref>, but is specifically designed for high accuracy, stability and reliability, even when used over typical Internet paths involving multiple gateways and unreliable networks. The following sections contain an overview of the procedures and algorithms used in NTP.

Reference-contexts: NTP and its implementations have evolved and proliferated in the Internet over the last decade, with NTP Version 2 now adopted as an Internet Standard (Recommended) [MIL89] and NTP Version 3 now adopted as a Proposed Standard [MIL90b]. NTP is built on the Internet Protocol (IP) <ref> [DOD81b] </ref> and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [POS80], which provide a connectionless transport mechanism; however, it is readily adaptable to other protocol suites. The protocol can operate in several modes appropriate to different scenarios involving private workstations, public servers and various network configurations.

Reference-contexts: The resulting offsets of this subset are first combined on a weighted-average basis using an algorithm similar to that described in <ref> [JON83] </ref> and then processed by a phase-lock loop (PLL). In the PLL the combined effects of the filtering, selection and combining operations are to produce a phase-correction term, which is processed by the loop filter to control the local clock, which functions as a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO).

Reference-contexts: Thus, both the server and the peer can independently calculate delay and offset using a single bidirectional message stream. This is a symmetric, continuously sampled, time-transfer scheme similar to those used in some digital telephone networks <ref> [LIN80] </ref>. Among its advantages are that the transmission times and received message orders are unimportant and that reliable delivery is not required. As shown in Figure 2, the computed delays and offsets for each peer are processed by the data-filter algorithm to reduce incidental timing noise.

Reference-contexts: The peerselection algorithm determines from among all peers a suitable subset of peers capable of providing the most accurate and trustworthy time using principles similar to those described in [VAS88]. In NTP this is done using a cascade of two subalgorithms, one a version of an algorithm proposed in <ref> [MAR85] </ref> and the other based on maximum likelihood principles to improve accuracy [MIL91]. The resulting offsets of this subset are first combined on a weighted-average basis using an algorithm similar to that described in [JON83] and then processed by a phase-lock loop (PLL).

Reference-contexts: While inexpensive, ubiquitous time transfer using a global computer network ordinarily cannot approach such precisions, accuracies of a few tens of milliseconds have been demonstrated for most paths in the Internet of today <ref> [MIL90a] </ref>. Among the requirements for ubiquitous timekeeping in a global computer networking community is to provide a standard chronometry for precision dating of present and future events. This requires a standard interpretation of computer timekeeping media with respect to conventional civil time and date as disseminated by national means. <p> A formal description and error analysis of the protocol is contained in [MIL90b].

Reference-contexts: In principle, reliable dating of such events requires only an accurate count of the days relative to some globally alarming event, such as a comet passage or supernova explosion; however, only historically persistent and politically stable societies, such as the ancient Chinese and Egyptian, and especially the ancient Maya <ref> [MOR83] </ref>, possessed the means and will to do so. 4.2.

In order to realize the new value, only those centennial years divisible by 400 would be leap years, while the remaining centennial years would not, making the new year within about 24 seconds of the actual solar year at that time.
