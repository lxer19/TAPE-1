Abstract: Broadcasting protocols can improve the efficiency of video on demand services by reducing the bandwidth required to transmit videos that are simultaneously watched by many viewers. We present here two broadcasting protocols that achieve nearly the same low bandwidth as the best extant broadcasting protocol while guaranteeing a lower maximum access time. Our first protocol, cautious harmonic broadcasting, requires somewhat more bandwidth than our second protocol, quasi-harmonic broadcasting, but is also much simpler to implement.

Reference-contexts: Viswanathan and Imielinski <ref> [4] </ref> have proposed a better solution that assumes that the clients can receive and store some segments of a video while watching other segments. <p> maximum access time is a better performance index because end-users tend to be mostly concerned by never having to wait too long for the services they request. 4 Related Work The first protocol to break a video into segments and display those segments repeatedly on different channels was pyramid broadcasting <ref> [4] </ref>. With this protocol the n segments are not the same size; each segment i, for 1 &lt; i n, is ff i1 times as large as the first segment, where ff is a value close to the base of natural logarithms e.

Reference-contexts: Their pyramid broadcasting protocol has been followed by several more recent proposals among which we should mention Aggarwal, Wolf and Yu's permutation-based pyramid broadcasting protocol <ref> [5] </ref>, Hua and Sheu's skyscraper broadcasting protocol [6] and Juhn and Tseng's harmonic broadcasting protocol [7]. Of all these protocols, harmonic broadcasting is the one promising the lowest bandwidth cost to achieve a given access time. <p> Permutation-based pyramid broadcasting <ref> [5] </ref> solves some of the problems of pyramid broadcasting in that it eliminates the pipelining of data to the client, and it removes the grouping of multiple videos per channel. <p> We used the unconstrained version of permutation-based pyramid broadcasting <ref> [5] </ref> and skyscraper broadcasting with a maximum width of 52 [6]. 5 Conclusions Video broadcasting protocols can improve the efficiency of video on demand services by reducing the bandwidth required to transmit videos that are simultaneously watched by many viewers.

Skyscraper broadcasting <ref> [6] </ref> limits the width of each segment, and so its segments, if stacked one on top of the other, would form a skyscraper shape rather than the pyramid shape of the segments from pyramid broadcasting. <p> We used the unconstrained version of permutation-based pyramid broadcasting [5] and skyscraper broadcasting with a maximum width of 52 <ref> [6] </ref>. 5 Conclusions Video broadcasting protocols can improve the efficiency of video on demand services by reducing the bandwidth required to transmit videos that are simultaneously watched by many viewers.

Of all these protocols, harmonic broadcasting is the one promising the lowest bandwidth cost to achieve a given access time. However, this excellent performance is marred by the fact that harmonic broadcasting sometimes fails to provide actual on-time delivery of all frames. <p> While more complex than either harmonic broadcasting or cautious harmonic broadcasting, quasi-harmonic broadcasting offers a guaranteed on-time delivery of all frames without any significant bandwidth penalty. 2 Harmonic Broadcasting Harmonic broadcasting (HB) <ref> [7] </ref> breaks a video into n equally-sized segments. If the length of the video is D and the consumption rate of the video is b, then S = Db is the size of the video, and each segment S i , for 1 i n, has size S=n. <p> Note that since the client will be receiving video data out of order, it will require local buffer space within the customer set-top box. The buffer space needs to be large enough to hold slightly less than 40 percent of the size of the video <ref> [7] </ref>. Using an example of MPEG-1 encoding and a two-hour video, the buffer would need to be approximately 500 megabytes in size.

Reference-contexts: Of all these protocols, harmonic broadcasting is the one promising the lowest bandwidth cost to achieve a given access time. However, this excellent performance is marred by the fact that harmonic broadcasting sometimes fails to provide actual on-time delivery of all frames. Juhn <ref> [8] </ref> suggested that this problem could be fixed by slightly delaying the moment at which the clients start consuming the video. While this extra buffering solves the problem, it also very significantly increases the video access time and reduces the competitive advantage of harmonic broadcasting over its rivals.
