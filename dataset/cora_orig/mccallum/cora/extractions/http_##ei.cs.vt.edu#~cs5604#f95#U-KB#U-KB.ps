Title: CS5604, Unit KB  
Author: Edward A. Fox 
Note: This Unit has two articles that should be studied. These will be supplemented by lectures on knowledge based information retrieval (KBIR) by the instructor. There is an optional third article that is recommended.

Abstract: Another model of information retrieval is that it involves knowledge-based operations, and should be viewed as a problem in the area of artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, IR involves document and query understanding, inferencing to identify matches, natural language processing to simplify interaction, expert system methods to have smarter systems, learning about users and problems to be more effective, and representation of knowledge as the basis of matching. We explore this family of approaches through a series of lectures and readings.

Reference-contexts: KBIR also seems to help build systems that are more usable or efficient, where the knowledge is reflected in the system behavior. In part this is the tact taken by Belkin et al. in developing Distributed Expert-Based 1 Information Systems (DEBIS) <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: NLP can also be applied to query and/or document analysis, leading to a detailed knowledge representation. This is faster when applied only to the query, where at least phrase identification usually occurs. More complex representations, such as conceptual graphs <ref> [4] </ref> or frame systems (as for chemical reactions) can also be developed. Of great potential is NLP applied to the documents, so a richer representation can be developed.
