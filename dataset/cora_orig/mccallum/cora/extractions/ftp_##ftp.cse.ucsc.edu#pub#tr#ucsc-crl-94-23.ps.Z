Abstract: In this thesis, stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) are applied to the problems of folding, aligning and modeling families of homologous RNA sequences| specifically, the small nuclear RNA sequences of the spliceosome. SCFGs generalize the hidden Markov models (HMMs) used in related work on protein and DNA to capture the sequences' common primary and secondary structure. This thesis discusses a recently introduced algorithm, Tree-Grammar EM, for deducing SCFG parameters automatically from unaligned, unfolded training sequences [SBU + 93, SBM + 94, SBH + 94a] and demonstrates its application to modeling three of the five prominent trans-acting factors in spliceosomal small nuclear RNA: U1, U5 and U6. Tree-Grammar EM, a generalization of the HMM forward-backward algorithm, is based on tree grammars and is faster than the previously proposed inside-outside SCFG training algorithm. Results show that after having been trained on as few as about 20 snRNA sequences, each of the three models can discern snRNA sequences from similar-length RNA sequences of other kinds, can find secondary structure of new snRNA sequences and can produce multiple alignments of snRNA sequences.

Reference-contexts: Efficiently computing Prob (s j G) presents a problem because the number of possible parse trees for s is exponential in the length of the sequence. However, a dynamic programming technique analogous to the Cocke-Younger-Kasami or Early parsing methods <ref> [AU72] </ref> for non-stochastic CFGs can complete this task in polynomial time (specifically, in time proportional to the square of the number of nonterminals in the grammar G times the average length of a typical sequence s, which in this work is on the order of jsj 3 ).

Reference-contexts: Tree-Grammar EM is based on tree grammars and is more efficient than the inside-outside algorithm [LY90], a computationally expensive generalization of the forward-backward algorithm developed to train SCFGs <ref> [Bak79] </ref>. Here, Tree-Grammar EM is used to derive, from small training sets of snRNA sequences (16 to 25 sequences per training set), three trained grammars. The training and testing sequences were taken from a 1993 database of aligned spliceosomal snRNAs [GP88, GRM93] maintained by Christine Guthrie et al. <p> Problem statement and context 5 grammars are exactly equivalent to HMMs and suggest an interesting generalization from HMMs to stochastic context-free grammars <ref> [Bak79] </ref>. This thesis discusses stochastic models for spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs developed using SCFGs as in previous work by Sakakibara et al. [SBH + 93]. These models resemble the protein HMMs of Krogh et al. [KBM + 94] but they incorporate base-pairing information. <p> This generalization, called TG Reestimator, is more efficient than the inside-outside algorithm, which was previously proposed to train SCFGs. The inside-outside algorithm <ref> [LY90, Bak79] </ref> is an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that calculates maximum likelihood estimates of an SCFG's parameters based on training data. (Expectation refers to the calculation of an auxiliary function that depends on the current and the reestimated model, while maximization refers to maximization over the reestimated model [Rab89].)

Reference-contexts: Following the method used in recent SCFG modeling of tRNA [SBU + 93, SBM + 94, SBH + 93, SBH + 94a], this work regularizes the grammars taking a Bayesian approach to the parameter estimation problem, similar to a previous approach taken with protein HMMs <ref> [KBM + 94, BHK + 93] </ref>. <p> For the base-pairing productions, the Dirichlet prior information about which productions are most likely is employed. For instance, Watson-Crick pairs are more frequently observed than other base pairs. Using the large alignment of 16S rRNA sequences [LOM + 93], the method described by Brown et al. <ref> [BHK + 93] </ref> was used to obtain the 16 parameters of a Dirichlet density over possible base-paired position distributions. These probabilities were used to calculate precise prior information about base-pair probabilities. <p> These probabilities were used to calculate precise prior information about base-pair probabilities. Similarly the 16S rRNA alignment was used to calculate a four-parameter Dirichlet prior for nucleotide distributions in loop match positions. Further details, with references to protein HMMs, are presented in the paper by Brown et al. <ref> [BHK + 93] </ref>. These parameters constitute the regularizer (Figure 2.5). The small parameter values imply that the 16S rRNA data set from which they were computed is highly variable.

Reference-contexts: This method is closely related to the "covariance models" (CMs) of Eddy and Durbin <ref> [ED94] </ref>. CMs are equivalent to SCFGs but the algorithms for training and producing multiple alignments differ. An in-depth comparison of the two methods is given elsewhere [SBH + 94a]. <p> Results using this approach to derive an SCFG to model tRNA were reported in previous work [SBU + 93]. At the other extreme, researchers recently have developed alternate methods for determining nearly all aspects of a grammar solely from training sequences <ref> [ED94] </ref>. To deduce a covariance model's structure (essentially, to choose an SCFG's productions), Durbin and Eddy use the standard Nussinov-Zuker dynamic-programming algorithm for RNA folding [NPGK78, Zuk89b], but with a non-standard cost function. <p> Currently the grammar-generating program does not generate special insert productions to allow for bulges (extra nucleotides inserted between two bases on one side of a helix) as in the grammars of Durbin and Eddy <ref> [ED94] </ref>, though it is straightforward to add this ability. It would involve adding insert productions of the form S ! aS and S ! Sa for helix match nonterminals, such that a single nucleotide could be inserted between any two positions on one side of a helix. <p> Z scores and BPB score are shown for those sequences closest to the Z-scores cutoff. 51 4. Discussion The SCFG method applied here represents a significant new direction in computational biosequence analysis. The results shown in this thesis, combined with recent results applying this method to modeling tRNA <ref> [SBU + 93, SBM + 94, SBH + 93, ED94] </ref>, lend support to the analytical utility of using SCFGs to model RNA. <p> SCFGs and their equivalents covariance models <ref> [ED94] </ref> appear to be the sole methods currently for obtaining a single unified model that can provide RNA multiple alignments, secondary-structure predictions and sequence discrimination. <p> It is currently not clear which approach will be best. The former problem might be solved by the development of effective methods for learning the grammar itself from training sequences. The work of Eddy and Durbin is an important step in this direction <ref> [ED94] </ref>. Their method relies on correlations between columns in a multiple alignment [GPH + 92, Lap92, KB93, Wat89, WOW + 90, San85, Wat88] to discover the essential base-pairing structure in an RNA family. Another approach would be to use a method like that proposed by Waterman 4.2.

Reference-contexts: If there is prior knowledge about sequence and structural aspects of an RNA family, this can be employed to create a descriptor (discriminating pattern) for the family which can then be used for database searching or generating an alignment for the family. This has been demonstrated clearly for tRNA <ref> [FB91, Sta80, Mar86] </ref>, where approximate string matching (locating all occurrences of substrings that are within a given similarity neighborhood of an exact match to the pattern) proved to be important.

Reference-contexts: In this way, TG Reestimator can be used even when precise knowledge of the base pairing is not available. TG Reestimator constitutes one part of the entire training procedure, Tree-Grammar EM. The Tree-Grammar EM procedure is based on the theory of stochastic tree grammars <ref> [TW68, Fu82, Sak92] </ref>. Tree grammars are used to derive labeled trees instead of strings. Labeled trees can be used to represent the secondary structure of RNA easily [Sha88, SZ90] (see Figure 2.2). A tree grammar for RNA denotes both the primary sequence and the secondary structure of each molecule. <p> This progression is similar to the path taken by the late King Sun Fu and colleagues in their development of the field of syntactic pattern recognition <ref> [Fu82] </ref>. Modeling pseudoknots and higher-order structure would require still more general methods. One possibility would be to consider stochastic graph grammars (see the introductory survey by Engelfriet and Rozenberg [ER91]) in hopes of obtaining a more general model of the interactions present in 54 4.

It is based on the premise that functionally equivalent RNA molecules are also structurally equivalent and relies on alignment and subsequent folding of many sequences into similar secondary structures (see review papers [JOP89, WGGN83]). <p> Such comparative methods have been used to infer the structure of small nuclear RNAs [GP88], tRNA [Lev69, HAE + 65, MEK66, ZDF + 66, RSF + 66], 5S RNA <ref> [FW75] </ref>, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) [WMG + 80, SCZ + 80, ZGB81], 23S rRNA [NKW + 91, GZB81, BKM + 81], group I introns [MW90, MECS90], group II introns [MUO89], ribonuclease P RNA [BHJ + 91, TE93], 7S RNA (signal recognition particle RNA) [Zwi89], telomerase RNA [RB91], MRP RNA [SBDC93] and

The algorithm of Lawrence et al. <ref> [LAW + 94, LAB + 93] </ref> for proteins produces local multiple alignments by finding blocks of residues conserved across sequences. The algorithm of Grate et al. [GHH + 94] extends the Lawrence approach to produce local multiple alignments of RNA.
