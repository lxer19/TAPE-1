Note: AMS(MOS) subject classifications. 90C33, 90C30, 49M45  
Abstract: STEPHEN J. WRIGHT fl TECHNICAL REPORT 97/01, OPTIMIZATION TECHNOLOGY CENTER, ARGONNE NATIONAL LABORATORY AND NORTHWESTREN UNIVERSITY Abstract. We describe a slight modification of the well-known sequential quadratic programming method for nonlinear programming that attains superlinear convergence to a primal-dual solution even when the Jacobian of the active constraints is rank deficient at the solution. We show that rapid convergence occurs even in the presence of the roundoff errors that are introduced when the algorithm is implemented in floating-point arithmetic. 1. Introduction. We describe a slight modification of the well-known sequential

Reference-contexts: Lemma 2.1. (Gauvin [5]) Suppose that Assumption 1 holds. Then S is bounded if and only if the MFCQ (8) is satisfied. A proof of the following result can be found in Bertsekas <ref> [1, Proposition 3.3.2] </ref>, for example. Lemma 2.2. If Assumption 1 holds, then z fl is a locally unique solution of (1).

Reference-contexts: His analysis, which rests partly on perturbation results developed by Dontchev and Hager <ref> [2] </ref>, does not require the starting to be sufficiently far from the boundary of S .

Reference-contexts: We can accommodate this restriction with the help of an active set identification technique such as that of Facchinei, Fischer, and Kanzow <ref> [3] </ref>. Our algorithm can periodically make an estimate of the active constraint set and then solve a subproblem to modify the current value of to make it "more strictly complementary" without increasing by too much.

Reference-contexts: Suitable algorithms could include Gaussian elimination with pivoting or a Bunch-Parlett or Bunch-Kaufman algorithm applied to a symmetric indefinite reformulation of the problem. (See, for example, Fourer and Mehrotra <ref> [4] </ref> and Wright [12] for a discussion of algorithms for symmetric indefinite matrices and their stability properties.) A standard backward error analysis applied to the general square system M x = r shows that the approximate solution ^x computed by stable factorization and triangular substitutions satisfies (M + E M )^x

Reference-contexts: Assumption 1 and the MFCQ (8) lead to two preliminary results that have appeared in previous work, as noted below. Lemma 2.1. (Gauvin <ref> [5] </ref>) Suppose that Assumption 1 holds. Then S is bounded if and only if the MFCQ (8) is satisfied. A proof of the following result can be found in Bertsekas [1, Proposition 3.3.2], for example. Lemma 2.2.

Reference-contexts: WRIGHT (see for example Golub and Van Loan <ref> [6, Chapter 3] </ref>). The effects of the errors of type (b) can be accounted for by introducing perturbations of size ffi u into all the elements of the matrix in (17).

Reference-contexts: Subsequent iterates are capured within a neighborhood such as N fl (*) and the superlinear convergence follows. Still, it would be more satisfactory to know that the algorithm exhibited the desired behavior without this identification/adjustment step. Hager <ref> [7] </ref> describes the behavior of a variant of stabilized SQP in which the coefficient in the stabilization term is replaced by a value that is bounded below by a sufficiently large multiple of dist ((z; ); S).

Reference-contexts: That is, there is a oe &gt; 0 such that w T L zz (z fl ; fl )w oekwk 2 ;(7) for all fl such that (z fl ; fl ) satisfies (3), and all w 2 ker Dg B (z fl ): Finally, we assume that the Mangasarian-Fromovitz <ref> [8] </ref> constraint qualification (MFCQ) holds at z fl .

Reference-contexts: Our analysis has much in common with the analysis A STABILIZED SQP METHOD 5 of Ralph and Wright <ref> [9, 10] </ref>, who deal with an interior-point algorithm rather than an SQP-based algorithm. Our focus on the SQP algorithm has practical significance because of the popularity of this method and because full rank of the active constraint Jacobian is frequently violated (or nearly so) on large-scale problems. <p> The proof of reverse estimate|dist ((z; ); S) = O ()|follows the proof of <ref> [9, Lemma 5.5] </ref> closely. The condition (z; ) 2 N fl (*) is important in deriving this estimate; that is, the component should be close to a "sufficiently strictly complementary" point in S rather than near some extreme point of this set.
