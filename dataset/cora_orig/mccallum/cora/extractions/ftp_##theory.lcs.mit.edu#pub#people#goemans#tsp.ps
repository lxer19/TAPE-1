Abstract: We consider most of the known classes of valid inequalities for the graphical travelling salesman polyhedron and compute the worst-case improvement resulting from their addition to the subtour polyhedron. For example, we show that the comb inequalities cannot improve the subtour bound by a factor greater than 10

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the last decade, strong cutting-plane methods have successfully solved larger and larger symmetric travelling salesman problem (TSP) instances to optimality. In the early nineties, Padberg and Rinaldi [27] have solved optimally an instance with 2; 392 cities, and more recently Applegate et al. <ref> [1] </ref>) have solved optimally instances with 3; 038, 4; 461 and even 7; 397 cities. These cutting-plane methods are based on an extensive investigation of the facets of the symmetric travelling salesman polytope (ST SP ) and its relatives. <p> this reason, cutting-plane approaches tend to use, in addition to the subtour elimination constraints, the comb inequalities or the clique tree inequalities, see Grotschel [13], Padberg and Hong [28], Crowder and Padberg [8], Grotschel and Holland [14], Padberg and Rinaldi [26, 27], Junger et al. [19] and Applegate et al. <ref> [1] </ref>. An exception is a recent implementation of Clochard and Naddef [6] which is based on the path inequalities.

Reference-contexts: Also, 2 S t X t i + 2t = p + 2t = 3t + h 1: Finally, one can easily verify that y is a dual feasible solution, completing the proof. fl Remark: Using a result of Boyd and Pulleyblank <ref> [4] </ref>, the strength of a clique tree inequality can be shown to be exactly equal to 3t + 2h 1 ; where npt denotes the number of nonpendent teeth of the clique tree. A nonpendent tooth is a tooth intersecting more than one handle. <p> A nonpendent tooth is a tooth intersecting more than one handle. Indeed, it is easy to derive from Theorem 2.2 of Boyd and Pulleyblank <ref> [4] </ref> that Z SP = 3t + 2h 2 npt, where Z SP denotes the optimum value when optimizing over SP . Notice that this is in agreement with Theorem 3 since one can easily show (for example, by induction) that npt h 1.

Many other classes of inequalities are known for ST SP or GT SP , including the path inequalities [7], the path tree inequalities [23], the binested inequalities [22], the crown inequalities [24] and the rank inequalities [12]. <p> A clique tree is represented in Figure 1. When the number of handles h is 1, the clique tree is called a comb. Combs were introduced by Chvatal <ref> [5] </ref> for the case with at most one 9 common vertex between a tooth and a handle and by Grotschel and Padberg [15] for the general case.

Reference-contexts: The simplest relaxation of GT SP consists of the subtour elimination constraints. The corresponding subtour polyhedron SP , or subtour elimination polyhedron, is defined as: SP = f x 2 R jEj : x (ffi (S)) 2 S V From an observation of Cunningham [21] (see Goemans and Bertsimas <ref> [11] </ref>), it follows that optimizing a nonnegative cost function over SP is equivalent to optimizing the shortest path cost function over the subtour polytope, obtained by adding the degree constraints x (ffifig) = 2 for all i 2 V to SP . <p> The result would follow immediately if one could prove that the degree constraints never affect the value of the relaxation when the cost function satisfies the triangle inequality. In the two extreme cases (the subtour polytope and ST SP ), this is indeed correct (for the subtour polytope, see <ref> [11] </ref>). 16 In this paper, we have provided a measure to evaluate relaxations for GT SP . It would be worthwhile to investigate other measures. In particular, one could try to compare the volumes of various relaxations for the TSP.

A clique tree C consists of a collection of subsets of vertices partitioned into handles H 1 ; : : : ; H h and teeth T 1 ; : : : ; T t such that: 1. No two teeth intersect, 2.

The strength of a comb inequality with t teeth is at most 3t+1 3t , 2.

Reference-contexts: How does one compare two relaxations? This question is not well understood and, in fact, one can formulate several notions of "tightness". For a recent investigation on a notion based on the volumes of P and Q, see Lee and Morris <ref> [20] </ref>. In this paper, we adopt an optimization point-of-view. Throughout this section, we assume that P R n + is a relaxation of a polyhedron Q R n + of blocking type. This assumption leads to a very natural notion of tightness.

The motivation of this paper is best expressed by the following quote from Naddef and Rinaldi <ref> [24] </ref>: For which ... inequalities ... would it be worth investing research time to find good separation algorithms, and computation time to run them in a cutting-plane algorithm? An answer to this question would be easier if there was some indicator that could be used to compare two classes of inequalities, <p> The convex hull of the incidence vectors of Eulerian subgraphs is called the graphical travelling salesman polyhedron, GT SP .

Many classes of facet-defining valid inequalities are known for GT SP . <p> They generalize the comb inequalities of Chvatal [5] and their extensions due to Grotschel and Padberg [15]. Many other classes of inequalities are known for ST SP or GT SP , including the path inequalities [7], the path tree inequalities [23], the binested inequalities [22], the crown inequalities <ref> [24] </ref> and the rank inequalities [12]. The simplest relaxation of GT SP consists of the subtour elimination constraints. <p> The resulting upper bounds can in most cases be attained. We should point out that two other notions of "strength" of TSP facet-defining inequalities have been proposed by Naddef and Rinaldi <ref> [24] </ref>. As a first measure, they suggest to evaluate the number of Hamiltonian cycles on the corresponding facet. Their second measure is somewhat similar to our notion of strength. <p> the strength of a path inequality is thus equal to 1 + i=1 r i i=1 r i 1 i=1 r i 1 3 where we have used the facts that r i 1 and k 3. fl 4.3 Crown inequalities Crown inequalities were recently discovered by Naddef and Rinaldi <ref> [24] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the last decade, strong cutting-plane methods have successfully solved larger and larger symmetric travelling salesman problem (TSP) instances to optimality. In the early nineties, Padberg and Rinaldi <ref> [27] </ref> have solved optimally an instance with 2; 392 cities, and more recently Applegate et al. [1]) have solved optimally instances with 3; 038, 4; 461 and even 7; 397 cities. <p> For this reason, cutting-plane approaches tend to use, in addition to the subtour elimination constraints, the comb inequalities or the clique tree inequalities, see Grotschel [13], Padberg and Hong [28], Crowder and Padberg [8], Grotschel and Holland [14], Padberg and Rinaldi <ref> [26, 27] </ref>, Junger et al.
