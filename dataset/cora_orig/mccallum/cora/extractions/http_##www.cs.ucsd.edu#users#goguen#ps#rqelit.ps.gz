Abstract: This paper surveys and evaluates techniques for eliciting requirements of computer-based systems, paying particular attention to how they deal with social issues. The methods surveyed include introspection, interviews, questionnaires, and protocol, conversation, interaction, and discourse analyses. Although they are relatively untried in Requirements Engineering, we believe there is much promise in the last three techniques, which grew out of ethnomethodology and sociolinguistics. In particular, they can elicit tacit knowledge by observing actual interactions in the workplace, and can also be applied to the system development process itself.

Reference-contexts: So called JAD or RAD groups 6 have recently become popular in Requirements Engineering, especially for Information Systems applications, because of their claim to greatly accelerate the development of requirements <ref> [1] </ref>. This method is closely related to focus groups, and can be expected to suffer from some of the same problems. In particular, participants will certainly be unable to articulate tacit knowledge.

Reference-contexts: They also have their own musical theory, according to which their scales, rhythms, and structures are correct; they do not orient to the twelfth root of two. (See <ref> [2] </ref> for a discussion of Ba-linese musical practice.) But in the nineteenth century and before, ethnocentric approaches were the norm, and non-Western culture was systematically devalued by such analyses. This paper suggests that similar things may be going on in much of today's Requirements Engineering.

Looking at such responses, especially in contrast with the fluent responses of middle class white children, one might well be tempted to say that the black children needed to be taught how to talk.

In fact, protocols were not used inductively for developing GPS; rather, GPS was developed on the basis of a priori principles about mathematical problem solving, and then used as a basis for describing and critiquing the arguments in empirically obtained protocols.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A basic question in Requirements Engineering is how to find out what users really need. Research has shown that many large projects fail because of inadequate requirements <ref> [5] </ref>; moreover, this inadequacy is often related to social, political and cultural factors. This paper describes and assesses techniques for requirements elicitation. We first review some traditional techniques, including introspection, questionnaires, interviews, focus groups, and protocol analysis.

Reference-contexts: However, when built, the angle of the protrusion made it harder to view documents jointly than before. Similar issues arise in requirements elicitation, because requirements engineers often come from communities with different values, assumptions, concerns, etc. from those of users. For example, <ref> [6] </ref> describes a case where two management information consultants working for a large U.S. university encounter difficulties in promoting schemes to help students, and then explain those difficulties with the theory that the administration is really concerned with "the care and feeding of the faculty," but cannot say so because this

Reference-contexts: For example, because the clients of architects are usually unfamiliar with the conventions of architectural drawings, they can easily agree to a design that fails to satisfy them when built. The Workplace Project 7 <ref> [7, 44, 45] </ref> found a case where some workers who wanted a space for working together, agreed to a protruding addition to a long tabletop. However, when built, the angle of the protrusion made it harder to view documents jointly than before.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, requirements are constantly reconsidered in both design and coding, and often activities that can be classified as Requirements Engineering are done by programmers and managers relatively near system delivery, or even after system delivery. Moreover, much of this work remains undocumented. (See <ref> [8] </ref> for an ethnographic study that supports these assertions.) Once a need is expressed and an initial plan developed, the requirements team tries to identify what properties the system should have to meet that need.

Reference-contexts: These different social meanings for the same behaviour ensure that it is almost always the woman who drops out of an overlap. Some larger scale studies of social reproduction have considered class distinctions among adolescent school children in Britain and the United States <ref> [50, 11] </ref>. In each case, working class students' attitudes towards the importance of friendship networks and school culture exactly reproduced the kinds of behaviours, attitudes, preferences and skills that led to their being tracked to skilled or unskilled labouring jobs, rather than to higher education or managerial and professional work.

Reference-contexts: This critique of traditional social science is relevant to requirements elicitation because most existing approach are based on it. If we are right, then the results of requirements studies that assume pre-given categories can easily be more inaccurate and misleading than necessary. Ethnomethodology <ref> [13] </ref> and conversation analysis (which grew out of ethnomethodology) arose in response to these problems. These fields consider that social order is accomplished by members in their moment by moment activities. For example, consider a seminar. <p> The assumption that social science methods differ from those used by the people studied is challenged by ethnomethodology, which argues that social scientists employ the same kinds sense-making activities as members of the culture studied <ref> [13] </ref>. This argues against scientific objectivity, or at least, against the claim that analysts have a unique access to objectivity. 6 Discourse Analysis Within linguistics, the phrase "discourse analysis" is used most broadly to describe the study of structures larger than the sentence.

Reference-contexts: These "war stories" are an important part of the work life of photocopy repair mechanics, although management may see this activity as `goofing off' rather than as a legitimate part of the job. Also, <ref> [14] </ref> mentions a case study by the authors of this paper, in which evaluations extracted from jokes and stories were used to reconstruct a value system for an organisation, and where task oriented discourse was used to determine work structure. 6.3 Reproducing Social Order We have discussed the orderly nature of <p> Techniques from discourse analysis can be useful when verbal communication is important to the system being developed; conversation analysis can also help to uncover limitations of other techniques. Some previous joint work of the authors, briefly described in <ref> [14] </ref>, shows how the discourse analysis of stories can be used to explore the value system of an organisation, and how the discourse analysis of explanations can be used for a kind of situated task analysis.

Reference-contexts: Some very common examples of the discourse unit that have been studied extensively are the oral narrative of personal experience [21, 24, 35], the joke [37], the explanation <ref> [15] </ref>, the spatial description [23, 27], and the plan [26]. As a structural unit, the discourse unit has two criterial properties: it has defined boundaries, and a describable internal structure. <p> The description of this internal structure is necessary for understanding the interactional process of discourse construction, because the task of hearers is quite different, for example, in different sections of a narrative. Moreover, discourse structure can be described with just as much mathematical precision as 10 sentential syntax (see <ref> [26, 15] </ref> for some appropriate math-ematical apparatus).

Conversation is one of the most prevalent yet invisible forms of social interaction, and may be considered typical of how people construct their world in an orderly way <ref> [16] </ref>. Conversation is a folk term for activities that members might describe as sitting around and chatting, just talking, socialising, etc.

Reference-contexts: Very few system development efforts have tried to use any social science methods beyond (for example) elementary guidelines for the conduct of interviews. Among these, very few indeed have tried to use techniques based on what we regard as the most promising areas, namely ethnomethodology and sociolinguistics (see <ref> [17, 28] </ref> for related discussion). It seems worth emphasising that many requirements methods available in the marketplace, even though they may refer to certain social, organisation, or linguistic issues, do not do so in a systematic manner, and in fact, do not have any proper scientific basis at all.

Reference-contexts: Thus, if a visitor walks into the office of someone working at a terminal, and the occupant turns his head and neck to greet the visitor while leaving his hands on the keyboard, the visitor can project that a short conversation is likely <ref> [18, 39] </ref>. This illustrates the demonstration of intention that is needed for this kind of analysis. Analysts cannot simply construct subjects' mental models or intentions. Rather, it is necessary to demonstrate what participants are doing that allows other participants to infer their intentions. <p> Interaction analysis can be used to discover details of non-verbal interaction in real work environments <ref> [18] </ref>; but the effort required to produce video transcripts suggests that this method should be used very selectively. Ethnography should be used continually to provide context for results obtained by other methods.

Reference-contexts: For example, researchers have apprenticed as a mid-wife, jazz musician, waitress, etc. Recently, the post-modern movement in ethnography has studied the process of becoming a member, and the assumptions that underlie the belief that the ethnographer has become a member (e.g., <ref> [19] </ref>). The assumption that social science methods differ from those used by the people studied is challenged by ethnomethodology, which argues that social scientists employ the same kinds sense-making activities as members of the culture studied [13].

Reference-contexts: Similarly, the use of impersonal constructions, such as "Well, looking at the left hand side" in the first sentence, and "It appears to be" in the second, is characteristic of the language of successful science <ref> [20] </ref>. Phrases like "excuse me, excuse me, it can't be done because of the horseshoe" are produced for an interlocutor; it is incoherent for a speaker to provide this kind of excuse to him/herself.

Reference-contexts: However, a different view was taken by Labov <ref> [21] </ref>. He went into a classroom with a rabbit and tape recorder, and told the children that the rabbit was shy and needed to be talked to so that it wouldn't be frightened. Then he and the teacher left the room. <p> Some very common examples of the discourse unit that have been studied extensively are the oral narrative of personal experience <ref> [21, 24, 35] </ref>, the joke [37], the explanation [15], the spatial description [23, 27], and the plan [26].

Reference-contexts: In viewing tapes of novice users learning a new interface, interface designers and cognitive scientists were consistently shocked by what they saw as incompetent and inconsistent behaviour <ref> [25] </ref>. <p> The fundamental idea is that the social world is already orderly, and this order is an on-going creation of the participants. Further, we as analysts don't know in advance what the relevant categories are, so we should not come to the data with a pre-given coding scheme. For example <ref> [25] </ref>, consider a party of eight people at a restaurant after a conference session.

Reference-contexts: Hence, we suggest that if there is room for doubt, introspection should be checked by some of the more empirical methods described below. 3 Interviews Interviews are used in an extraordinary variety of domains, and are often quite successful; see <ref> [30] </ref> for a good survey. This section discusses questionnaires, open ended interviews, and focus groups, showing that the interview process involves some (usually unstated) assumptions about the interaction between interviewer and subject. <p> Here is another example (cited in <ref> [30] </ref>) of an answer that must be classified as "other": I: Are you a virgin? R: Not yet. 3.2 Open ended Interviews The open ended interview is much used in anthropology and psychology, and avoids many problems of the questionnaire method.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, protocol analysis is based on a simplistic cognitivist model of human thinking as essentially computational, involving abstract representations of concepts, and their transformation by algorithms that are precisely specified by computer programs (e.g., see <ref> [31] </ref>). Finally, even if it were possible to get a trace of a speaker's autonomous cognitive activity, such an object would be inappropriate for the requirements process, because the client does not have any pre-existing mental model of the desired system.

Reference-contexts: There seem to be two main arguments for talk-aloud protocols: that they are possible, and that they work. The argument for possibility must overcome arguments in psychology about the method of introspection used in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is claimed <ref> [32] </ref> that the arguments against introspection do not apply, because the subject is not introspecting, but rather is emitting a stream of behaviour that does not differ in kind from producing a galvanic skin response or a muscular movement. <p> It reduces goals to subgoals, and then attempts to solve each subgoal that remains open by reducing it to further subgoals, until all subgoals are solved. In <ref> [32] </ref>, the goals are to deduce certain symbolic logic expressions from others, and the transformations are certain elementary steps of deduction 8 . The results of this research have not stood the test of time. <p> This implies that the experimental method used must have been flawed, and that is our main point: protocol analysis is not a reliable guide to what subjects are thinking, and is open to serious misinterpretation by analysts, who can choose a small sample of protocols (just one was used in <ref> [32] </ref>!) for an unrealistic problem (both ar tificially simple and artificially without social context) to impose their preconceptions on the data. Beyond this demonstration of its fallibility, one can give two further arguments against protocol analysis, one general, and one specific to requirements. <p> Let us consider the protocol given by Newell and Si-mon <ref> [32] </ref>, produced by a student doing a problem in elementary symbolic logic: Well, looking at the left hand side of the equation, first we want to eliminate one of the sides by using rule 8. It appears to be too complicated to work with first.

Reference-contexts: The order that it creates is the normative form of conversation: there should be one speaker at a time, with no gaps or overlaps <ref> [38] </ref>. It is important to note that what counts as a gap or overlap is culturally determined [41]. For example, what sounds like a long pause for a New Yorker may be barely noticeable for a New Englander.

Reference-contexts: Thus, if a visitor walks into the office of someone working at a terminal, and the occupant turns his head and neck to greet the visitor while leaving his hands on the keyboard, the visitor can project that a short conversation is likely <ref> [18, 39] </ref>. This illustrates the demonstration of intention that is needed for this kind of analysis. Analysts cannot simply construct subjects' mental models or intentions. Rather, it is necessary to demonstrate what participants are doing that allows other participants to infer their intentions.

Reference-contexts: But if only less detailed, or higher level structure is needed, then open ended interview data may be ade quate. 4 3.3 Focus and Application Development Groups The focus group is a kind of group interview, rather widely used in marketing research <ref> [42] </ref>, but less used in pure social science research ([29] gives a favourable review of the potential of focus groups in social science). In this technique, groups are brought together to discuss some topic of interest to the researcher.

Reference-contexts: Suchman <ref> [43] </ref> explains that naturally occurring plans are typically used as after-the-fact explanations to lend coherence to past events. <p> For a detailed summary of recent research on human planning, see <ref> [43] </ref>. Even in mechanical theorem proving, where the difficulties of being embedded in the physical world do not arise, current research uses a variety of heuristics, and also employs techniques that support flexible replanning | as do human mathematicians. <p> We close this paper with some research tasks that seem to merit further investigation: 1. Do detailed empirical studies of the entire system lifecycle, including the role of planning, management and phases, using ideas of Suchman <ref> [43] </ref>; in particular, investigate the hypotheses that requirements activities are distributed throughout the life-cycle, and that plans serve at least as much to jus tify actions as they do to predict them. 2.

Reference-contexts: For example, because the clients of architects are usually unfamiliar with the conventions of architectural drawings, they can easily agree to a design that fails to satisfy them when built. The Workplace Project 7 <ref> [7, 44, 45] </ref> found a case where some workers who wanted a space for working together, agreed to a protruding addition to a long tabletop. However, when built, the angle of the protrusion made it harder to view documents jointly than before.

Reference-contexts: Compared with ordinary conversation, the survey interview suppresses those interactional resources that routinely mediate uncertainties of relevance and interpretation. Suchman and Jordan <ref> [46] </ref> argue that validity is not assured by having the same words repeated to subjects in each interview, because these words will mean different things to different people in different contexts. <p> In normal interaction, these issues of interpretation are negotiated between participants; but in a survey interview, the method and training given to interviewers specifically forbids such negotiation. The following example should make this point more vivid <ref> [46] </ref> 5 : I: Generally speaking, do you usually think of yourself as a Republican, Democrat, Independent, or what? R: As a person. I: As a Republican:: R: No. I: Democrat:: R: No. I: Independent or what. R: Uhm:: I think of myself as a (pause) Christian.

Reference-contexts: We conclude not that introspection is an inadmissible method, as claimed by many current psychologists, but rather that introspection without careful consideration of its limits can be (and often is) highly inaccurate (an interesting discussion of introspection can be found in <ref> [47] </ref>). Hence, we suggest that if there is room for doubt, introspection should be checked by some of the more empirical methods described below. 3 Interviews Interviews are used in an extraordinary variety of domains, and are often quite successful; see [30] for a good survey.

Reference-contexts: In cross-sex conversations, from 75% to 90% of successful interruptions involve men interrupting women. (The percentages differ slightly, depending on the situation, and the degree of acquaintance of the conversational partners.) Why is this? West and Zimmerman <ref> [48, 49] </ref> suggest that interruption by one's conversation partner is not only a consequence of lesser status, but is also a way of establishing and maintaining a status differential.

Reference-contexts: These different social meanings for the same behaviour ensure that it is almost always the woman who drops out of an overlap. Some larger scale studies of social reproduction have considered class distinctions among adolescent school children in Britain and the United States <ref> [50, 11] </ref>. In each case, working class students' attitudes towards the importance of friendship networks and school culture exactly reproduced the kinds of behaviours, attitudes, preferences and skills that led to their being tracked to skilled or unskilled labouring jobs, rather than to higher education or managerial and professional work.

Reference-contexts: Such are the exigencies of empirical research. It is even better to compare interview data with recorded, non-elicited data, to see if they are usably similar. For example, <ref> [51] </ref> shows that elicited narratives differ from spontaneously produced narratives on a fine level of detail, including use of the historical present tense. This difference arises because performing a narrative, so that the addressee can visualise the event, encourages use of the historical present.

Reference-contexts: A successful interruption is an example of a violation of a speaker's turn in which participant A begins to speak, participant B begins to speak while A is still speaking, and A then drops out. It has been found in U.S. data <ref> [52] </ref> that interruptions are very rare in same-sex conversations.
