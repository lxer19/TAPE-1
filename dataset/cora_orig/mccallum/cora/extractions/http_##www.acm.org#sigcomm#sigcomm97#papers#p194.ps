Abstract: The floor acquisition multiple access (FAMA) discipline is analyzed in networks with hidden terminals. According to FAMA, control of the channel (the floor) is assigned to at most one station in the network at any given time, and this station is guaranteed to be able to transmit one or more data packets to different destinations with no collisions. The FAMA protocols described consist of non-persistent carrier or packet sensing, plus a collision-avoidance dialogue between a source and the intended receiver of a packet. Sufficient conditions under which these protocols provide correct floor acquisition are presented and verified for networks with hidden terminals; it is shown that FAMA protocols must use carrier sensing to support correct floor acquisition. The throughput of FAMA protocols is analyzed for single-channel networks with hidden terminals; it is shown that carrier-sensing FAMA protocols perform better than ALOHA and CSMA protocols in the presence of hidden terminals.

Reference-contexts: Several other MAC protocols based on similar RTS-CTS exchanges, or RTSs followed by pauses, have been proposed before and after MACA for either single-channel wireless networks or wireline local area networks <ref> [1, 4, 10, 11, 12, 16] </ref>. The IEEE 802.11 [3, 6] committee proposed a MAC protocol for wireless LANs that includes a transmission mode based on an RTS-CTS handshake. In this paper, we study the channel access method we have introduced previously [5] and called FAMA (floor acquisition multiple access). <p> FAMA protocols constitute variations of existing MAC protocols based on RTS-CTS handshakes that eliminate collisions of data packets. Section 2 introduces two representative FAMA protocols for single-channel networks. Although the original motivation for MACA, IEEE 802.11, MACAW <ref> [1] </ref>, and BAPU [16] was to solve the hidden-terminal problems of CSMA by using RTS-CTS handshakes, it is easy to show by example that simply introducing three-way handshakes (RTS-CTS-data) or even more complex handshakes (RTS-CTS-data-ACK or others) does not suffice to eliminate all instances in which two or more senders are <p> is much longer than the duration of the RTS-CTS handshake. (A packet train is made up of a bounded number of packets sent by the station holding the floor.) Section 5 compares by simulation the performance of FAMA-NCS with MACAW, which is based on RTS-CTS handshake and is packet sensing <ref> [1] </ref>. Our results show very clearly that floor acquisition and carrier sensing are critical to the performance and simplicity of MAC protocols based on RTS-CTS handshakes for networks with hidden-terminals. <p> This can be done using different persistence and backoff strategies. In this paper, we consider only non-persistent protocols. We also specify FAMA protocols that use a uniform distribution when choosing backoff times; however, other backoff strategies can be adopted (e.g., see those proposed for MACAW <ref> [1] </ref>). <p> Following the deferment specified by the RTS, a station with a packet to send waits a random waiting period before it transmits an RTS. MACA and improvements over it are also discussed in detail by Bharghavan et al. <ref> [1] </ref>. 3 Correct Floor Acquisition 3.1 Carrier-Sensing Protocols For a FAMA protocol to provide correct floor acquisition, it must ensure that each new packet, or any of its retransmissions, is sent to the channel within a finite time after it becomes ready for transmis sion, and that a data packet does <p> We present results for the FAMA-NCS protocol using single packet transmissions as well as packet trains. Figure 11 shows the various configurations used by the simulations. Table 1 show the results for FAMA-NCS as compared to MACAW <ref> [1] </ref>. To illustrate the importance of carrier sensing, we chose to compare FAMA-NCS against MACAW instead of FAMA-NPS, because MACAW uses packet-sensing and RTS-CTS handshakes and its performance has been reported before by Bharghavan et al.

[1] For our simulation analysis we assumed single channel spread spectrum radios capable of transmitting at 256 Kbs. The stations are within four miles of each other, giving a maximum propagation delay of approximately 20 microseconds. <p> This negative effect of hidden terminals remained unnoticed even in detailed simulation experiments carried out for MACAW <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Contrary to the conjectures made in prior work on MAC protocols based on collision avoidance <ref> [1, 7] </ref>, our verification and throughput analysis demonstrates that carrier sensing should be used in single channel networks because it substantially improves performance by enabling floor acquisition in the presence of hidden terminals.
