Reference-contexts: Two versions of the new server have been built: one that leaves the CERN server code completely intact, and one that uses a small modification to eliminate the need for an additional CGI-script (which slows things down). The Ode database system was chosen <ref> [Agrawal & Gehani 89] </ref> [Gehani 91], because it was and is freely available to universities (after signing a license agreement with AT&T). The HTML parser needed to be at least as forgiving to syntax errors in HTML documents as most browsers.

Reference-contexts: Documents are stored as objects of which the internal structure represents the HTML structure, thus enabling querying for structural elements like headers, hypertext links, quotes, addresses, etc. The most influential similar approach to enhancing the WWW is the Hyper-G project <ref> [Andrews et al. 95] </ref>, which has a richer structure than WWW, but can reduce documents to HTML in order to serve them to WWW browsers.

Reference-contexts: A primitive search facility has been added to this server. The internal index structures to make searching efficient will be added in the near future. We also wish to integrate our document repository system DReSS <ref> [De Bra & Aerts 95] </ref> with this server. By doing so the basic unit for locking can be reduced from a whole document to the smallest structural HTML elements, enabling more concurrent authoring than with the current version of DReSS.

Reference-contexts: The HTML parser needed to be at least as forgiving to syntax errors in HTML documents as most browsers. For this reason we have developed our own HTML parser, instead of reusing an existing parser like SGMLS or SP <ref> [Clark 95] </ref>. * The WWW server of our department would be the first test case. Since we have many people serving documents off that server, the transition from the file system based server to the Ode based server had to be very smooth.

Reference-contexts: Several attempts have been made to build additional structures, that provide search facilities for the information stored on a WWW-server or a cluster of servers. Glimpse <ref> [Manber & Wu 94] </ref> provides indexing at the server level. Harvest [Schwartz et al. 94] extends Glimpse to offer retrieval over a set of servers. The existing index databases ignore most or all of the internal structure of the documents.

Asking for information that appears in a "header" of certain levels, e. g. levels 1, 2 and 3, is not possible.
