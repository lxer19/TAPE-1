Title: Supporting Information Infrastructure for Distributed, Heterogeneous Knowledge Discovery  
Author: Roger King and Michael Novak

Abstract: The growing amount of information available, and the distributed, heterogeneous nature of this information are having a very major impact on the field of data mining. No longer is it true that state of the art information about a particular topic resides in one location. More and more knowledge discovery involves looking in multiple, heterogeneous databases for the information desired. And, as the Information Highway grows this will be increasingly true. Thus, we feel that it is no longer enough to create ad hoc knowledge discovery methods to search for and organize this information. Instead, an infrastructure to accommodate knowledge discovery must be put in place ahead of time. In this paper we discuss why we feel this is necessary and how we are attacking this problem.

Reference-contexts: To this end, we are in the process of designing and building a system (Sybil) that will support a piecemeal and incremental approach to integrating selected portions of a large information environment. This contrasts sharply with approaches based on the development of a global schema <ref> [BLN86] </ref>, and also contrasts with the Federated approach [SL90]. Our approach is based on permitting groups of databases to become inter-related in a largely autonomous fashion in support of some commonality.

Reference-contexts: The databases could also be connected via a commercial heterogeneous database product such as Pegasus [SAD + 95] or UniSQL <ref> [KGK + 95] </ref>. However, such systems tend to provide transparent heterogeneity by viewing data via one data model (generally object-oriented). To make viewing data in this manner possible, the various schemas must be translated into one data model, then integrated into a global schema.

Reference-contexts: As mentioned previously, connecting databases in an ad hoc manner via a knowledge discovery application generally leads to a system that is very difficult to evolve in any consistent manner. The databases could also be connected via a commercial heterogeneous database product such as Pegasus <ref> [SAD + 95] </ref> or UniSQL [KGK + 95]. However, such systems tend to provide transparent heterogeneity by viewing data via one data model (generally object-oriented). To make viewing data in this manner possible, the various schemas must be translated into one data model, then integrated into a global schema.

Reference-contexts: This contrasts sharply with approaches based on the development of a global schema [BLN86], and also contrasts with the Federated approach <ref> [SL90] </ref>. Our approach is based on permitting groups of databases to become inter-related in a largely autonomous fashion in support of some commonality. In particular, we wish to support both materialized and virtual views across databases, along with inter-database constraints and update propagation.

Reference-contexts: Sybil provides multi-model access with explicit heterogeneity by incrementally integrating only those pieces of the schema that have some relationship based on application semantics. This is done by using rule-based mediators <ref> [Wie92] </ref> to create and maintain such relationships. There are three main advantages to this. First, the time saved by not doing large-scale integration can be very significant. Second, dynamic system reconfiguration can be supported.
