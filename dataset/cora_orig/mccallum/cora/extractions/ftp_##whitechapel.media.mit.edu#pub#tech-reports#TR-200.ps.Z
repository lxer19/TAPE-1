Abstract: 1 M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 200 Appeared: Proc. 26th Annual Asilomar Conf. on Signals, Systems,and Computers, Pacific Grove, CA Oct. 92, pp 1011-1015. Abstract We discuss the problem of modeling structured textures and image data with random field models. Random field models have recently been applied to a variety of problems such as image enhancement, segmentation, and coding. The models have been shown to successfully reproduce a variety of stochastic patterns, but have not been successful for capturing structure in patterns. Two possible solutions to the structured pattern problem are examined in this paper. The first solution is based on the structure present in the initial state of the random process, and the second is based on a relationship between "internal" random field interactions and coupling to a set of "external" constraints.

Reference-contexts: By contrast, the Markov random field model can theoretically synthesize any pattern, structured or stochastic, with nonzero probability. Cross and Jain <ref> [1] </ref> showed that this model is capable of synthesizing a variety of stochastic-looking textures. However, in studies applying this model to structured patterns, the resulting synthesized patterns were not visually similar to the originals [1, 2]. The structural components were not reconstructed. <p> Cross and Jain [1] showed that this model is capable of synthesizing a variety of stochastic-looking textures. However, in studies applying this model to structured patterns, the resulting synthesized patterns were not visually similar to the originals <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. The structural components were not reconstructed. The use of only pairwise statistics in the model is one limitation; better results are to be expected with higher order statistics [3]. <p> For the finite periodic lattice S with a symmetric neighborhood structure one can define a Gibbs energy. There are many ways to define the energy; the one used in this paper is the autobinomial energy originally defined by Besag [5], and used for texture by Cross and Jain <ref> [1] </ref> and Garand and Weinman [6]. The autobinomial energy is E (x) = s2S ff s x s + r2N s ! where the model parameters are ff s , the possibly spatial varying external field, and fi sr , the possibly spatial varying bonding parameters for the internal field. <p> In this context, one may be interested in finding samples from this probability distribution which maximize the probability P (x), consequently minimizing the Gibbs energy. To minimize the energy, Monte Carlo stochastic relaxation algorithms such as the Metropolis exchange <ref> [1, 6] </ref> are often applied. These algorithms are iterative, making typically small changes at each iteration in an effort to minimize the global energy function. An iteration of the Metropolis exchange algorithm swaps pairs of elements in the current state (image) according to a probabilistic rule. <p> When the Metropolis exchange algorithm is used, and when ff s = ff, i.e., the external field is homogeneous, then one can show that the external field term cancels and hence has no effect [6]. This is the case in the texture study of Cross and Jain <ref> [1] </ref>, so that their results, which did not achieve any structured patterns, can be attributed to interactions of the internal field fi parameters only. In applications of the GRF used with MAP estimation it is useful to consider a non-homogeneous external field.

Reference-contexts: The structural components were not reconstructed. The use of only pairwise statistics in the model is one limitation; better results are to be expected with higher order statistics <ref> [3] </ref>. However, it is generally impractical to get an accurate estimate of the statistics as their order is in 2 creased. In general, it is hard to find a model which represent both structure and randomness efficiently. A brief discussion on the definition of "structure" is apropos before proceeding.

Reference-contexts: Combinations of these first two strings, in higher dimensions, e.g., periodic in one direction and random in the other like a plowed field, periodic in both like a checkerboard, or random in both like a pile of leaves, span the basic categories typically used for texture classification <ref> [4] </ref>. The third string is quite different from the first two strings. Although an anagram of the first string, the third string has a specific structure. Consequently, it has the most information content of the three cases.

Reference-contexts: For the finite periodic lattice S with a symmetric neighborhood structure one can define a Gibbs energy.

Reference-contexts: A GRF image pattern is a sample from this probability distribution. The Gibbs distribution is easily incorporated into a Bayesian framework, and frequently used as an image model in the context of maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation <ref> [7] </ref>. In this context, one may be interested in finding samples from this probability distribution which maximize the probability P (x), consequently minimizing the Gibbs energy. To minimize the energy, Monte Carlo stochastic relaxation algorithms such as the Metropolis exchange [1, 6] are often applied. <p> There is a basic theoretical problem <ref> [7] </ref> with this method of putting structure in the random field. In theory, the final state of the GRF should be independent of the initial state. Clearly, this is not the case here, as the structure in the initial state is intentionally preserved.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the structure in the initial image is lost depending on T . Furthermore, one can show that the behavior of increasing T is approximately the same as the behavior of decreasing the magnitude of the fi parameters or decreasing the number of graylevels <ref> [8] </ref>. For certain combined ranges of these values, the effect will be that of low temperature, which will preserve initial structure for a long time. Garand and Weinman ran the Metropolis Exchange for approximately 12 iterations. <p> Over so few iterations, and over their relatively low temperature conditions, the initial state structure is preserved. Thus, one practical problem with this model is the careful monitoring required to ensure that the initial structure is preserved. By empirical study of temperature dependent "phase transition" behavior <ref> [8] </ref>, one can determine the temperature ranges (or temperature annealing schedules) that are appropriate. For non-isotropic parameters, however, this can be a lot of work.

Reference-contexts: If not for competition from the internal field product, the synthesized random field would align itself perfectly with the desired external field. The internal field product term, P been shown elsewhere <ref> [9] </ref> to be maximized when the graylevel sets in the image form configurations which maximize their "separation", analogous to the separation of immiscible fluids. The product x s x r is maximized when the same graylevels occur as neighbors. <p> Thus, the minimum energy internal field will have minimal length boundaries between pairs of graylevel sets. Moreover, a region of constant graylevel, g, will tend to be surrounded by regions of constant graylevel g 1 or g + 1. The second-order statistics for such patterns can be quite restricted <ref> [9] </ref>. In Figure 2 an example is shown using an external field to introduce structure. Here a balance is maintained between the external and internal fields so that both of them contribute to the final pattern.

ICASSP, pages III.41-III.44, </booktitle> <address> San Francisco, CA, </address> <year> 1992. </year>
Reference-contexts: One potentially promising alternate method for incorporating structure is to decompose the random field into its mutually orthogonal stochastic, deterministic, and evanescent components using a Wold-like decomposition as by Francos, et al. <ref> [10] </ref>. The stochastic component is then represented with an autoregres-sive model, and the other two components are represented by some kind of structural model. The structural model of Francos, et al. consists of sums of delta functions. Currently, however, the Wold decomposition only works for a homogeneous random field.
