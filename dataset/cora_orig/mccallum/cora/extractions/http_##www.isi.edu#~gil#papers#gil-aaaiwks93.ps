Reference-contexts: Incompleteness is one possible fault in the given domain model. The initial domain may contain incompletely specified operators, and may be missing operators for legitimate actions that the planner can use to achieve goals. In previous work <ref> [1] </ref>, we described the use of experimentation within the (ORM) to find new preconditions and effects of existing operators.

Reference-contexts: Learning is always incremental, preferring overly incomplete specifications (that are progressively refined by the ORM) to more detailed specifications that may be incorrect. None of the methods is guaranteed to work, only the external execution of a proposed operator can prove its correctness. See <ref> [2] </ref> for more details on this work. 1 2 Direct Analogy If a given problem cannot be solved by a set of operators because a precondition P that specifies the type of an object of an operator O cannot be achieved, formulate a new operator by direct analogy with O through

Reference-contexts: The initial domain may contain incompletely specified operators, and may be missing operators for legitimate actions that the planner can use to achieve goals. In previous work [1], we described the use of experimentation within the (ORM) to find new preconditions and effects of existing operators. Shen and Simon <ref> [3, 4] </ref> describe methods to learn new operators: by exploring available actions whose effects are unknown, or by splitting an existing operator into two different ones when an expectation failure occurs. This paper presents some additional methods to acquire new operators.
