Abstract: Technical Report 97/24 October, 1997 Abstract One of the central problems in knowledge discovery is the development of good measures of interestingness of discovered patterns. With such measures, a user needs to manually examine only the more interesting rules, instead of each of a large number of mined rules. Previous proposals of such measures include rule templates, minimal rule cover, actionability, and unexpectedness in the statistical sense or against user beliefs. In this paper we will introduce neighborhood-based interestingness by considering unexpectedness in terms of neighborhood-based parameters. We first present some novel notions of distance between rules and of neighborhoods of rules. The neighborhood-based interestingness of a rule is then defined in terms of the pattern of the fluctuation of confidences or the density of mined rules in some of its neighborhoods. Such interestingness can also be defined for sets of rules (e.g. plateaus and ridges) when their neighborhoods have certain properties. We can rank the interesting rules by combining some neighborhood-based characteristics, the support and confidence of the rules, and users' feedback. We discuss how to implement the proposed ideas and compare our work with related ones. We also give a few expected tendencies of changes due to rule structures, which should be taken into account when considering unexpectedness. We concentrate on association rules and briefly discuss generalization to other types of rules. fl This work was supported in part by a research grant from the Australian Research Council.

Reference-contexts: introduction and the following. The issue of interestingness of general discoveried knowledge was discussed in [7]. Interestingness can also be measured in terms of the statistical strength of a pattern such as confidence and support <ref> [2] </ref>, and ancestor rules' confidences [9]. The problem of how to find patterns satisfying multiple criteria of interestingness has been investigated in [13]. A comprehensive survey about measurements of interestingness can be found in [11]. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, useful interestingness measures should help identify those rules that are surprising to the user. We believe that our neighborhood-based unexpectedness is very useful in this regard, and can be used in complement the other measures. Rule template was also used to help find interesting rules <ref> [5] </ref> and it is an objective measure for interestingness. A template is an expression A 1 ; : : : ; A k ) A k+1 ; where, each A i is either an item name, a class name, or an expression C+ or Cfl (C is a class name).

Reference-contexts: Unexpectedness can be either subjective or objective. Apparently, if a newly discovered pattern is surprising to the user, then it is certainly interesting. For the subjective ones <ref> [6, 11] </ref>, "surprising" means the discovered knowledge contradicts the user's beliefs. Therefore, unexpectedness is closely related to beliefs or general impressions. Beliefs can be classified into two types: hard beliefs and soft beliefs.

Reference-contexts: The subjective ones, in contrast, depend not only on the structure of a rule and the data, but also on the user who examines the rules. Two useful subjective interestingnesses are actionability and unexpectedness. The notion of actionability <ref> [8, 10] </ref> of association rules is based on the usefulness of the rules to user - whether the users can do something because of the rules to their advantage.
