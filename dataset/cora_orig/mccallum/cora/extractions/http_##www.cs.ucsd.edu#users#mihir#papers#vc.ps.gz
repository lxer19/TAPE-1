Reference-contexts: Anonymity in NetCash is also trust-based, with multiple currency servers which the client selects; this in turn implies an accounting infrastructure in order to maintain consistency accross servers, etc. [17]. Additionally, NetCash is cast as a framework that can accommodate various electronic currency mechanisms, iKP <ref> [3] </ref>, SET [21], etc., are credit card-based payment systems. We are looking for some form of cash. 1.2 Variety Cash In VarietyCash, the issuer functions as a mint. Coins are tokens authenticated under an issuer master key. <p> The protocol is designed to guarantee both privacy and authenticity of the data. This is to protect the coin purchase information and the coins that are issued. It must also 1 Another possibility is that this payment is made by credit card, in which case an iKP/SET-type protocol <ref> [3, 21] </ref> may be used, instead of the protocol we are describing here. The issuer would play the role of the merchant in SET. provide freshness. For efficiency's sake we use a key exchange protocol to get a session key K under which later messages are encrypted or MACed.

Reference-contexts: The issuer will have to invest some resources to be able to handle lots of transactions quickly. This, however, appears feasible for reasonable load. Our protocols minimize the overhead. Batching and aggregation can be used to reduce costs (e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>). This design originated in response to a request of a certain large financial service corporation to seek a practical, viable e-money system.

Reference-contexts: Attempts to address some of these issues have been made (e.g. via escrow [13]) and stored-value card based settings mitigate others <ref> [7] </ref>, but drawbacks remain. Mondex [14], on the other side of the spectrum, provides no anonymity. It seems to be a shared key based card design. There are well-known scalability and security problems with such designs.

Reference-contexts: The strongest form of anonymity (unconditional) is provided by systems based on so-called blind signatures [10]. (These systems were first proposed by Chaum <ref> [8] </ref>. At this point, there are many of them published.) However, these systems have many well-known drawbacks. Tygar and Yee (as reported in [22]) point out that the protocols lack atomicity: network failures during a transaction will result in loss of the electronic money involved.

Reference-contexts: Also the NetBill server maintains accounts for buyers and merchants, which is costly. Also, NetBill's transaction protocols include functions that are beyond payment, such as price negotiation. The trend nowadays is that these functions should be separated, and standardized; e.g., JEPI <ref> [12] </ref>, SEMPER [20]. Our design (its network version) shares many features with NetCash [16, 15] (NetCash has no "off-line" operation, meaning the ability to also work with stored-value cards). The NetCash protocols also combine symmetric-key cryptography for performance with public-key mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: Another problem (as pointed out in [16]) is scalability: as all coins that have been spent have to be recorded, the coin data base will grow over time, increasing the cost to detect double spending. Attempts to address some of these issues have been made (e.g. via escrow <ref> [13] </ref>) and stored-value card based settings mitigate others [7], but drawbacks remain. Mondex [14], on the other side of the spectrum, provides no anonymity. It seems to be a shared key based card design. There are well-known scalability and security problems with such designs.

Reference-contexts: US, at least, so-called Regulation E obligates the service provider of account-based systems to provide customers with a level of account maintenance (e.g., periodic statements) which increases the cost of such systems. * Network versus card-based: Some systems are software-based for transactions across the net work; in others, like Mondex <ref> [14] </ref>, stored-value cards are used. * Atomicity: The system should be fair and robust in the sense that network failures, for example, do not result in incomplete transactions [22]. <p> Attempts to address some of these issues have been made (e.g. via escrow [13]) and stored-value card based settings mitigate others [7], but drawbacks remain.

Reference-contexts: If a single module is penetrated, not only is significant retailer fraud facilitated, but the entire card base may be compromised. NetBill <ref> [19] </ref> has a large spectrum of desirable properties, including atomicity. It might be able to provide some limited anonymity via trust in the NetBill server and the use of pseudonyms, but linkage is still possible. Also the NetBill server maintains accounts for buyers and merchants, which is costly.

Reference-contexts: Second, the tag-computing algorithm should be "strong." One can of course use MACs based on existing primitives such as DES. This may be acceptable, but we suggest that a Triple-DES based MAC be used. A good choice would be a Wegman-Carter <ref> [23] </ref> type MAC, meaning that one applies an XOR-universal hash function to the data and then XORs the result with the value of a Triple-DES based pseudorandom function applied to a counter.
