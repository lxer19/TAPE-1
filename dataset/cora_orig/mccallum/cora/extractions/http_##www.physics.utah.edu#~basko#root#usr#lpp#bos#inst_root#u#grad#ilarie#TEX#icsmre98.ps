Abstract: We have investigated the class of disubstituted polyacatylene (PDPA) such as pristine and doped with C 60 , using both transient and steady state spectroscopies. These polymers show high yield photoluminescence which causes spectral narrowing at high excitation intensities, despite of their ground state degeneracy. In PDPA-nBu/C 60 mixture we found photoinduced charge transfer from the degenerate ground state polymer chains to the C 60 molecules. Trans-polyacetylene (t-PA ) is the most generic degenerate ground state (DGS) polymer having a simple backbone structure; in the past two decades this polymer has played an important role in understanding the physics of -conjugated polymers. It has been known, however that t-PA has a very weak photoluminescence (PL) band in the infrared spectral range[1], with a quantum efficiency =10 5 . Similarly, monosubstituted t-PA exhibits weak PL in the near infrared[2]. This weak PL from degenerate ground state polymers has been explained by the relative positions of the lowest excited electronic levels: 1 1 B u and 2 1 A g . In t-PA 2A g is located below 1B u [3],where the transition 1A g - 2A g is dipole forbidden. However, intense PL has been observed in soluble dis-ubstituted polyacetylenes such as poly(1-phenyl-2-p-n-butylacetylene (PDPA-nBu) (Fig.1) at 520 nm and poly(1hexyl-2phenyl acetylene)(PHxPA) at 455nm. Futhermore , in some PDPA films it is possible to achieve laser action, or emission spectral narrowing, at sufficiently high excitation intensities[4]. Apparently the disubstitution of t-PA drastically changes the optical emission properties. This might be due to the fact that the substituted side group molecules may influence the electronic energy states of the poly mer backbone structure [4]. Our studies focus on PDPA-nBu (Fig.1 the right inset), which is a degenerate ground state (DGS) polymer, as recently shown by doping studies[5].We have investigated spontaneous and stimulated emission in thin films of PDPA-nBu and showed that the strong PL is accompanied by high optical gain and emission spectral narrowing at high intensities [4]. We also report the results of steady state photoinduced absorption (PA) spectroscopy studies of C 60 doped PDPA-nBu at various doping concentrations. We obtained spectral evidence of photoinduced charge transfer from the excited state of this polymer onto adjacent C 60 molecule through PA measurements. This is in contrast to the common belief that in DGS polymers the photoinduced charge transfer is suppressed by soliton generation, being faster than the charge transfer process[6]. In addition, polaron and soliton PA bands were also identified.

Reference-contexts: This is comparable to our best DOO-PPV films [10]. In Fig.3 (a) we show the PA spectrum of a pristine PDPA-nBu film. The spectrum contains only one PA band peaked at 1.7eV which is at much higher energy than the S + absorption band induced upon iodine doping <ref> [5] </ref>. This PA band was identified as due to photogenerated neutral soliton-antisoliton S 0 S 0 pairs, using photoinduced absorption detected magnetic resonance measurements [5].

Reference-contexts: The weak PL in these DGS polymers has been traditionally explained by the soliton model, in which the primary excitations are soliton-antisoliton (S S) pairs [7].Then upon photoexcita-tion the photogenerated e-h pair, which immediately (within 100fs) transforms into S + -S <ref> [8] </ref>, relaxes very quickly (within 400fs) into a S 0 -S 0 pair with similar even parity structure as the 2A g state [9].We believe that the strong PL in PDPA-nBu polymer originates from strongly bound S + -S pairs, namely solitonic exciton, which do not immediately transform into the S

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that C 60 itself does not have any absorption features or PA bands between 0.05-1.4 eV <ref> [12] </ref>; the peak at 1.15eV and its vibronic structures are therefore due to C 60 . These transitions were also observed in the absorption spectrum of C 60 generated by fl ray irradiation [13].

Reference-contexts: These transitions were also observed in the absorption spectrum of C 60 generated by fl ray irradiation <ref> [13] </ref>. The photoin-duced charge transfer between the conjugated polymer chains and intercalated dopant is governed by energetics i.e. by the relative position of the polymer energy levels with respect to those of the dopant.

Reference-contexts: C 60 is a weak dopant for PDPA-nBu having its LUMO level within the gap of the polymer. It has been shown that there are two different channels for pho-toinduced charge transfer: either e transfer from the photoexcited polymer chain, or hole transfer from the photoexcited C 60 molecule <ref> [14] </ref>.
