Abstract: A growing interest in real-world applications of inductive techniques signifies the need for methodologies for applying them. So far a number of methodologies for applying inductive learning techniques are described. After reviewing several published approaches, a number of unsolved problems are discussed, two major problems being the lack of attention to nontechnical issues and the focus of most approaches on specific, well defined problems with a limited scope. We propose the MeDIA-model as a reference structure for the application of inductive learning techniques that covers the issues mentioned in other approaches and generalises from problem specific approaches. The model is part of a methodology that aims at supporting the application of inductive learning techniques in various settings, and helps to plan projects where such techniques are involved.

Reference-contexts: The shift of focus is also reflected in a number of workshops on the process of ML application that were organised within recent ICML conferences (Langley and Kodratoff, 1993), <ref> (Aha and Riddle, 1995) </ref>, (Engels et al., 1997a). Much of the existing work on methodological aspects of ML application focuses on the technical details of applying the technique, thereby ignoring the higher level design aspects of ML application.

Reference-contexts: The initial task that is selected for decomposition is then a prediction task. Several ways of generating a task decomposition are possible now. In our case we want to design a solution by using a repository of pre defined solution parts. The idea of such parts is described in <ref> (Breuker and van de Velde, 1994) </ref>, (Chandrasekaran, 1986), etc. and will not be repeated here. The decomposition that was chosen in our example provides us with a refinement of the initial task, namely a method for performing prediction tasks, where a model for decision making is required.

Reference-contexts: Task specificity leads to two characteristics: the lacking of a task analysis phase, and the presence of task specific analysis tools. An example of a task specific approach is that of <ref> (Brodley and Smyth, 1995) </ref>, being completely configured around the classification task. Examples of task independent approaches are described in (Engels, 1996) and (Verdenius, 1997b). In these approaches derivation of a task decomposition is a central notion in the process.

Reference-contexts: In literature this development is reflected in the growing number of reports on process models and methods for Machine Learning (ML) application (Kodratoff et al., 1994) <ref> (Brodley and Smyth, 1997) </ref> (Garner et al., 1995) and work on KDD application support ((Engels, 1996), (Craw et al., 1992), (Engels et al., 1997b)). <p> Moreover, the functional environment of application of the ML technique is not static, but actively influenced as part of the ML application process. This is specifically the case for pre- and post-processing of data. The approach of <ref> (Brodley and Smyth, 1997) </ref> is sligthly more general then the other approaches in that they extend the scope of their method for applying ML techniques to the process of analysing the problem environment, not only in terms of data, but also in terms of (what they call) domain specific factors such <p> In this approach, we can observe the same aspect of generality towards the task to perform and the independence of techniques to be used, as was observed for <ref> (Brodley and Smyth, 1997) </ref>. All of these approaches can be described according to three dimensions: Technique orientation Process models can be oriented towards (a group of) techniques, or they can be technique independent. An example of a technique group oriented approach is the one used in MLT Consultant. <p> An example of a technique group oriented approach is the one used in MLT Consultant. The whole approach focuses on differentiating several techniques from others in a set of techniques. An example of an technique independent approach is that of <ref> (Brodley and Smyth, 1997) </ref>. Here, a task is supported, without limitations on the specification of the techniques to be used. Task orientation Process models can be oriented towards a specific (expert) task, or they can be unspecific towards the task to learn. <p> Limited scope Most approaches either tend to support application of a specific technique (group) (e.g. MLT focusing to a set of ten (learning) algorithms (Consortium, 1993)), or to support the realisation of a specific task (e.g. <ref> (Brodley and Smyth, 1997) </ref>, (Brodley and Smyth, 1997)), and often they combine these aspects (e.g. classification with ML- techniques). This implies that important aspects of an applications development cycle, being the design task and the technique selection task, are taken for granted. <p> Limited scope Most approaches either tend to support application of a specific technique (group) (e.g. MLT focusing to a set of ten (learning) algorithms (Consortium, 1993)), or to support the realisation of a specific task (e.g. <ref> (Brodley and Smyth, 1997) </ref>, (Brodley and Smyth, 1997)), and often they combine these aspects (e.g. classification with ML- techniques). This implies that important aspects of an applications development cycle, being the design task and the technique selection task, are taken for granted. <p> Application specific Many approaches limit themselves towards a specific application type. An specific approach (Reinartz and Wirth, 1995), is meant to cover the KDD task. However, the KDD task is only a specific case of the much broader process of inductive technique application. The approach of <ref> (Brodley and Smyth, 1997) </ref> is limited in several ways. First, it concentrates on classification tasks. As explained above, this is only one of a large family of tasks inductive techniques can be applied for.

Reference-contexts: As such, there is hardly any support for developers who are confronted with the need of applying inductive techniques in their applications.

This process takes place at the Analysis level and makes use of a repository that describes a set of techniques available to the system.
