Abstract: There is an increasing need for Internet hosts to be able to quickly and efficiently learn the distance, in terms of metrics such as latency or bandwidth, between Internet hosts. For example, to select the nearest of multiple equal-content web servers. This paper explores technical issues related to the creation of a public infrastructure service to provide such information. In so doing, we suggests an architecture, called IDMaps, whereby Internet distance information is distributed over the Internet, using IP mul-ticast groups, in the form of a virtual distance map. Systems listening to the groups can estimate the distance between any pair of IP addresses by running a spanning tree algorithm over the received distance map. We also present the results of experiments that give preliminary evidence supporting the architecture. This work thus lays the initial foundation for future work in this new area.

Reference-contexts: What form does the distance information take, and how is it used to produce answers for specific pairs of Internet hosts? Several efforts to obtain various sorts of distance information and other Internet characteristics are currently being undertaken, e.g. the SPAND, FELIX, Octopus, IPMA, NIMI, and MINC projects <ref> [7] </ref>, [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. These projects serve various purposes, such as general Internet characterization, maintenance, and end-system distance estimation. Much of this work applies to some aspects of the first question above. None of this work, however, is being done in the context of a general SONAR/HOPS service.

Reference-contexts: Even if network failure information were available, given the heavy load that BGP updates exert on routers, even after significant damping of network change information <ref> [13] </ref>, it is clear that the IDMaps infrastructure could not carry such information. As for load sensitive distance information, it is questionable as to whether it should be provided at all.

Reference-contexts: Unlike determining the global set of IP addresses, determining the set of APs, while non-trivial, seems feasible (see Section III-H). The scale of the information, however, is still prohibitive. There are some 50,000 and growing assigned CIDR blocks <ref> [14] </ref>, and probably several times that many distinct APs. Probing, disseminating, and storing the full list of P 2 pairs of AP-AP distances (easily a terabyte, given 200,000 APs and 25 bytes per list entry) is equally out of the question.

Reference-contexts: One way is to keep a list of distances from every Autonomous System (AS) to every other. The AS is the unit of path information carried by the BGP inter-domain routing protocol. BGP also maps blocks of IP addresses into their ASs <ref> [15] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: basic question we want to investigate is: given a number of Tracers distributed around the Internet, how close would the distance between two points estimated by IDMaps be to the actual distance? To answer this question, we use traceroute data collected with the network probe daemon (NPD) tool described in <ref> [18] </ref>. A number of sites on the Internet were recruited to run NPDs. At random intervals, these NPDs were asked to measure the route to another NPD site using traceroute. <p> At random intervals, these NPDs were asked to measure the route to another NPD site using traceroute. A full description of the measurement process, such as inter-measurement interval, number of measurements per period, etc., and data cleansing done on the collected data are available in <ref> [18] </ref>. In this paper we analyze the traceroute data collected by the NPDs in two experiments: the Nov. 3 to Dec. 21, 1995 experiment (D1) and the Sep. 4, 1996 to Jan. 24, 1997 experiment (D2).
