Abstract: Current interactive user interface construction tools are often more of a hindrance than a benefit during the early stages of user interface design. These tools take too much time to use and force designers to specify more of the design details than they wish at this early stage. Most interface designers, especially those who have a background in graphic design, prefer to sketch early interface ideas on paper or on a whiteboard. We are developing an interactive tool called SILK that allows designers to quickly sketch an interface using an electronic pad and stylus. SILK preserves the important properties of pencil and paper: a rough drawing can be produced very quickly and the medium is very flexible. However, unlike a paper sketch, this electronic sketch is interactive and can easily be modified. In addition, our system allows designers to examine, annotate, and edit a complete history of the design. When the designer is satisfied with this early prototype, SILK can transform the sketch into a complete, operational interface in a specified look-and-feel. This transformation is guided by the designer. By supporting the early phases of the interface design life cycle, our tool should both ease the development of user interface prototypes and reduce the time needed to create a final interface. This paper describes our prototype and provides design ideas for a production-level system. We are developing an interactive tool called SILK, which stands for Sketching Interfaces Like Krazy, that allows designers to quickly sketch an interface using an electronic stylus. SILK then retains the sketchy look of the components. The system facilitates rapid prototyping of interface ideas through the use of common gestures in sketch creation and editing. Unlike a paper sketch, the electronic sketch allows the designer or test subjects to try out the sketch before it becomes a finished interface. At each stage of the process the interface can be tested by manipulating it with the mouse, keyboard, or stylus. Figure 1 illustrates a simple sketched interface. The interface has a scrollbar and a window for the scrolling data. It also has several buttons at the bottom, a palette of tools at the right, and four pulldown menus at the top. Traditional user interface construction tools are often difficult to use and interfere with the designers creativity. Our goal is to make SILKs user interface as unintrusive as pencil and paper. In addition to providing the ability to rapidly capture user interface ideas, SILK will allow a designer to edit the sketch using simple gestures. Furthermore, SILKs history mechanisms will allow designers to reuse portions of old designs and quickly bring up different versions of the same interface design for testing or comparison. Changes and written annotations made to a design over the course of a project can also be reviewed. Thus, unlike paper sketches, SILK sketches can evolve without forcing the designer to continually start over with a blank slate.
