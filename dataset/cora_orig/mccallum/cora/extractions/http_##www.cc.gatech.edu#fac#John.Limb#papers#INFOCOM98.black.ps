Abstract: Cable plants were initially designed for one-way broadcast of analog television signals (from the head-end to the neighborhood). They are now being upgraded to provide an upstream path (from the home to the head-end). New challenges arise in using the upstream channel since the available bandwidth is low and the noise levels are high. Different variations of the reservation Aloha protocol have been proposed as the MAC protocol to efficiently share the scarce upstream capacity. The efficiency of the reservation protocol highly depends on the capacity assigned to the reservation channel. In this paper we present a control mechanism that dynamically adjusts the operating parameters to the current load on the system. The control mechanism does not require any framing structure and is built around a "sea of mini-slots". The performance under both static and highly dynamic loads is close to optimum. The station implementation remains particularly simple and the downstream control structure is also simple. Results are given here for fixed length data units (ATM cells) but the algorithm extends very simply to variable length MAC frames.

Reference-contexts: Stations can be located at any distance from the head-end. A number of MAC protocols have been proposed for cable data communication and they are mostly a variation of the reservation ALOHA protocol <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. The basic operation of the reservation ALOHA channel as applied to a cable modem is as follows: A station on receiving a message to transmit divides it into basic units (cells or 802 LLC frames) which occupy a single MAC-level slot in the upstream channel.

A Contention Slot Allocator (CSA) is used to dynamically vary the slot structure. An adaptive p-persistence CRA is used to better utilize the contention mini-slots (CMSs). CPR <ref> [2] </ref> is used as the basic MAC protocol for the study but the proposed algorithms are independent of the underlying communication protocol between stations and head-end. The curve of delay versus applied load characterizes an important aspect of the static performance of a protocol. <p> The upstream slot structure is fixed and defined with a data slot for granted transmissions and a fixed number (typically two) of CMSs. The CRA used is a type of tree algorithm. CPR <ref> [2] </ref> was designed as a centralized scheme with a very simple station protocol. The slot structure is also fixed and very similar to XDQRAP. The main difference in the upstream structure is in the definition of a data mini-slot.

Reference-contexts: Contention resolution is by means of, but not restricted to, an adaptive p-persistence algorithm [11]. 3 Sea of Mini-Slots The performance of the protocol depends more on the framing structure employed than the details of the CRA algorithm <ref> [3] </ref>. We have assumed that there is no frame structure used in the scheduling of data traffic 1 . At the lowest level there is just a sequence of mini-slots (as shown in Fig. 3).

Reference-contexts: Since we plan to implement the described protocols we will give preference to simple algorithms if there is little performance penalty involved. 2 Previous Work The first MAC protocol proposed for HFC systems was (X)DQRAP <ref> [4] </ref>. XDQRAP is a distributed scheme where stations independently control access to the medium by monitoring the downstream channel. The upstream slot structure is fixed and defined with a data slot for granted transmissions and a fixed number (typically two) of CMSs.

Reference-contexts: Thus the station does not require knowledge of any framing structure that may be used by the head-end to service different traffic (e.g. frames used in support of CBR traffic <ref> [5] </ref>). All subsequent proposals [6, 7, 8, 9] adopt the centralized approach but impose different frame structures. A typical upstream frame structure is shown in Fig. 2. A group of data slots and contention mini-slots (CMSs) constitute a frame. <p> The only difference in this case is that due to the increase in 1 There could well be a frame structure used for the transmission of periodic traffic as described in <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: As far as we are aware all adaptive protocols so far explored use some type of framing and clustering of slots. We refer to them collectively as frame-based algorithms. Little information is disclosed about the head-end control mechanism. The only slot allocator described so far is proposed by Zenith <ref> [10] </ref> and uses the head-end queue of pending requests to distribute the bandwidth between data and contention channels. In this paper we develop adaptive algorithms that are close to the best achievable bounds for the performance of the upstream channel of a cable modem.

Reference-contexts: As we shall see in our discussion of the Contention Slot Allocator (CSA), it is more difficult to optimally use the contention slots when the network has non-zero delay. 3.2 Optimal use of the Contention Mini-Slots Several CRAs have been proposed in the past for multiple access systems <ref> [12] </ref>. We have chosen to work with the p-persistence based algorithms mainly due to their simplicity and ease of implementation. Stations asynchronously decide to transmit (with probability p) in a particular CMS independently of previous and subsequent CMSs. <p> The optimum usage of the CMSs will occur if the probability p, is adjusted to be 1=N a where N a is the number of users contending in the particular mini-slot <ref> [12] </ref>. In a real system it is not possible to know the exact number of competing users and hence an estimator is required. <p> However in a simulation environment the actual number is easily obtained (especially when stations are all at the same location) by checking the state of the stations at every mini-slot. We refer to this ideal implementation as ideal p-persistence. 5.2 Pseudo-Bayesian Estimator The pseudo-Bayesian estimator was proposed by Rivest <ref> [12] </ref> to estimate the number of contending users in a slotted aloha system. The algorithm uses the feedback information (result of the transmission) to adjust the current estimate. Binary feedback, in the form of Collision/Non-collision, is used. A Non-collision state includes a successful transmission as well as an empty mini-slot.

Reference-contexts: The optimal use of the contention mini-slots is achieved when the probability p is adjusted to the number of contending users at every individual mini-slot (see Section 5.1). 4 Simulation Procedure and Bounds on Performance 4.1 Simulation Procedure Our simulation process adheres closely to the procedure outlined in <ref> [13] </ref>. We use two of the sources defined in [13], i) a bursty source with a distribution of message sizes as shown in Fig. 4, (the average size of a message is 368.1 bytes or 7.67 48-byte cells) and ii) a Poisson source of single cell (48 byte payload) messages used <p> is achieved when the probability p is adjusted to the number of contending users at every individual mini-slot (see Section 5.1). 4 Simulation Procedure and Bounds on Performance 4.1 Simulation Procedure Our simulation process adheres closely to the procedure outlined in <ref> [13] </ref>. We use two of the sources defined in [13], i) a bursty source with a distribution of message sizes as shown in Fig. 4, (the average size of a message is 368.1 bytes or 7.67 48-byte cells) and ii) a Poisson source of single cell (48 byte payload) messages used to stress the reservation channel. <p> This is purposely designed to stress the CRA both in terms of the stability of the algorithm and the transient response. The parameters of the network and the simulation are also taken largely from <ref> [13] </ref> and are given in Table 1. The upstream slot structure is rather simple. The payload of an ATM cell fits in three mini-slots and the ATM header of 5 bytes plus the PHY overhead and guardband requires a further mini-slot. <p> It appears that the error correction/detection coding/decoding will be by far the greatest component, approximately 2 to 6 ms [14]. At low values of load we should expect to approach an access delay of T min . 4 This definition differs from that used in <ref> [13] </ref>, but is more consistent with common usage. frameless MAC protocol 5 Contention Resolution Algorithm 5.1 Ideal p-persistence Collisions are resolved by using a p-persistent algorithm (stations transmit a request in a particular mini-slot with probability p).
