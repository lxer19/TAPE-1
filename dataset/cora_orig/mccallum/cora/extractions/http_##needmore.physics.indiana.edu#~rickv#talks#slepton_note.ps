Abstract: The selection of acoplanar and acollinear pairs of leptons with significant missing energy described in OPAL PN-241 has been updated to use the full data sample of 10.3 pb 1 collected at a centre-of-mass energy of p s =161 GeV. This note gives updated tables, figures and results. For details of the analysis please refer to PN-241. Model independent limits on the production cross-sections for ~e, ~, ~t and ~ 71.8 GeV is obtained for tan fi = 1:5, = 200 GeV and m ~ 0 1 = 12:0 GeV. A 95% C.L. lower limit on the smuon mass of 52.0 GeV is derived for m ~ 0 1 = 12.0 GeV. This note describes preliminary OPAL results, and is intended primarily for the members of the collaboration

Reference-contexts: Two analyses have been performed using independent code. For Analysis A the modifi cations to the event selection cuts with respect to <ref> [1] </ref> are given in in Section 1.1. With the exception of a change to the veto on forward EE clusters the event selection cuts for Analysis B are unchanged with respect to [1]. Updated event selection statistics and distributions of cut variables for Analysis B are given in Section 2. <p> For Analysis A the modifi cations to the event selection cuts with respect to <ref> [1] </ref> are given in in Section 1.1.

Updated event selection statistics and distributions of cut variables for Analysis B are given in Section 2. Limits on the production of new particles, evaluated using the results of Analysis B, are given in Section 2. <p> The results presented in this note correspond to an integrated luminosity of 10.3 pb 1 at p s = 161.3 GeV. 1.1 Analysis A We have used the same analysis as described in <ref> [1] </ref> with the following modifications: * In cut (5) the acoplanarity angle and the acollinearity are required to be greater than 10 0 (previously 20 0 ) and smaller than 175 0 respectively. * Cuts (6) and (7) have been replaced by the following simpler cut: (6) In order to reduce <p> After the anti-WW selection cuts the four events are classified as follows: Run 7270 event 9719 contains one electron and one tau candidate. A picture of this event was given in <ref> [1] </ref>. The event is classified as a stau candidate for all m values. It is classified as a chargino candidate for m 10 GeV. It is not classified as a selectron or smuon candidate. Run 7274 event 61080 contains two high energy muons. <p> It is classified as a chargino candidate for m 10 GeV. It is not classified as a selectron or smuon candidate. Run 7274 event 61080 contains two high energy muons. A picture of this event was given in <ref> [1] </ref>. It is classified as a smuon candidate for m m/2. It is not classified as a selectron, stau or chargino candidate. Run 7402 event 5725 contains two electron candidates, with momenta 19.2 GeV and 7.3 GeV. The event is shown in figure 23. <p> A picture of this event was given in [2]. It is not classified as a candidate for any of the search categories. 8 2 Analysis B A study of random triggers has shown that a rather large inefficiency for cut 7 as defined in <ref> [1] </ref> would arise due to very low energy noise clusters in EE. <p> The sum of the energy of all such clusters ( EE ) does not exceed 4 GeV. (See figure 19.) After this modification the total inefficiency from the vetos given in cuts 6, 7 and 11 of <ref> [1] </ref> have been estimated from random triggers to be 3.6%. The distributions of some of the cut variables are given in figures 10-22. The distributions are shown after a loose selection has been applied. <p> Five events have been accepted by the general selection of Analysis B in the data taken at p s = 161 GeV. Additional criteria to distinguish the different possible sources of acoplanar lepton events are applied, as described in Section 5.5 of <ref> [1] </ref>. The five events are classified by these additional criteria as follows: Run 7270 event 9719 contains two tau candidates. A picture of this event was given in [1]. The event is classified as a stau candidate for all m values. <p> Additional criteria to distinguish the different possible sources of acoplanar lepton events are applied, as described in Section 5.5 of <ref> [1] </ref>.

The event is shown in figure 24. <p> The event is therefore almost certainly of the type e + e + and the activity in SW could be used as part of the missing muon veto (cut 11 of section 5.3 in <ref> [1] </ref>) to reject the event as a candidate. 9 cut data SM e e e + e + e q e + + q - fl 4-f +1 1 ~ e remo v total (%) none 5. .10 .00 .00 .02 .01 2.98 68.9 2. .00 .10 .00 .12 .00 .09 <p> A picture of this event was given in [2].
