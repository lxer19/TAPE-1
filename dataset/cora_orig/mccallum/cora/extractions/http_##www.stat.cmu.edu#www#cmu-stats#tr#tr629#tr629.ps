Abstract: This paper investigates several aspects of the pricing of currency and currency options. In section 2 a standard model for the behavior of stocks will be applied to currency exchange rates. This model will be used to value European call options on currencies in section 3. Market values for various exchange rates and currency options will be used to analyze the accuracy of the model. Data for this paper was collected from the Financial Analysis and Securities Traders' Lab at the Graduate School of Industrial Administration at Carnegie Mel-lon University. The Japanese Yen, the British Pound, and several other currencies were monitored. Most attention in section 4 will be focused on the "volatility" of the stochastic process of the exchange rate. The implied volatility of European call options will be calculated and shown to be non-constant and associated with other variables in the model. In section 5 the true distribution of exchange rate will be inferred from the observed currency options and the observed exchange rate. The behavior of domestic and foreign interest rates and their effects on exchange rates also will be discussed briefly in Appendix A. Some deviations from the exchange rate model assumptions will be shown and possible improvements to the model will be suggested. The final sections summarize the findings of this paper and suggest extensions of and refinements to the analysis.

Reference-contexts: A simple modification allowing for known dividends extends the theory to the valuation of currency options where the risk-free foreign interest rate is viewed as a dividend. 3.2 The Black-Scholes Analysis In 1973 Fischer Black and Myron Scholes presented valuations of European call and put options on non-dividend-paying stocks <ref> [1] </ref>. The assumptions made in the derivation are * Stock price follows Geometric Brownian motion (see section 2.2), * Frictionless Market (see section 2.1), * Perfectly divisible securities, and * Constant (across maturities and across time) risk-free interest rate.

Reference-contexts: More elaborate models have been developed based on theoretical considerations rather than a strict data analytic approach. These models should be fit to the dataset to determine their accuracy. Some generalizations of the Black-Scholes model can be found in <ref> [2, 6, 10, 13] </ref>. The scope of the paper could have been much smaller. There are many possible extensions to the original Black-Scholes model. Specifying one extension and determining its accuracy could be very rewarding.

Reference-contexts: A summary and suggestions for future work conclude the paper. A short appendix concerning the role of interest rates is also included. 2 Currency This section contains a brief introduction to mathematical models of currency markets and currency behavior. See <ref> [5] </ref> for a more extensive description and development. Some of the model assumptions and their consequences are probed in this paper. 2 2.1 Markets Markets play a vital role in business by providing a convenient and structured environment for trading. <p> To facilitate mathematical models for the behavior of securities, several simplifying assumptions are commonly made about how markets operate. Actual markets do not operate under the following assumptions but do not deviate significantly from a "Frictionless Market" <ref> [5, pp 49, 154] </ref>: * There are no transaction costs. * All trading profits are subject to the same tax rate. * Market participants can borrow money at the same risk-free interest rate as they can lend money. * Market participants take advantage of arbitrage opportunities as they occur. <p> An investor could buy the stock for the lesser price and sell it at the higher price for a risk-less profit. 2.2 Currency Models This section describes a standard mathematical model for stock prices <ref> [5, pp 192-9] </ref> which is also used to describe the behavior of currency exchange rates.

Reference-contexts: Another generalization is to allow the volatility to be a stochastic pro cess depending on S t and T instead of being deterministic (See <ref> [6] </ref>). 2.3 Currency Data The dataset for this paper was collected real-time in the Financial Analysis and Securities Trading Lab at Carnegie Mellon's Graduate School of Industrial Administration. <p> More elaborate models have been developed based on theoretical considerations rather than a strict data analytic approach.

Reference-contexts: The chi-square statistic is slightly lower for the t 5 approximation than for the normal approximation, indicating a slightly better fit. Another simple summary is the correlation between quartiles of the empirical distribution and the quartiles of a hypothesized family of distributions <ref> [11] </ref>. A higher correlation coefficient indicates better fit.

Reference-contexts: Plot (a) shows all observations; plot (b) shows only the median and quartiles of the distribution of implied volatility at each strike price. 4.1 Implied Volatility and Strike Price Many authors (e.g. <ref> [13] </ref>) have noted a "smile" in the plot of implied volatility vs. strike price for stock options and market index options. This behavior is evident for currency options also. <p> More elaborate models have been developed based on theoretical considerations rather than a strict data analytic approach. These models should be fit to the dataset to determine their accuracy. Some generalizations of the Black-Scholes model can be found in <ref> [2, 6, 10, 13] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The original goal of the investigation was to find through data analytic means a model for currency exchange rates which is both parsimonious and more accurate than the Black-Scholes model for stock behavior. The first indications (see <ref> [14] </ref>) that a new model was necessary came from plots of "implied volatility" vs. strike price. Volatility is a constant in the Black-Scholes model but it is clearly related to strike price in the market. A "smile" is evident where a horizontal line should be (e.g. figure 2).
