Abstract: A laser-plasma-based source of relativistic electrons is described in detail, and analyzed in two dimensions using theoretical and numeric techniques. The source uses two laser beams, focused in a plasma. One beam excites a wake-field electron plasma wave. Another locally alters the trajectory of some of the electrons in such a way that they can be trapped and accelerated by the wave. With currently available table-top terawatt lasers, a single ultrashort-duration electron bunch can be accelerated to multi-MeV energies in a fraction of a millimeter, with femtosecond synchronization between the light pulse, the electron bunch and the plasma wave. Two dimensional PIC simulations and analysis of single particle trajectories show that a radial wake field may be beneficial to the beam's properties. The nature of the accelerated beam is such that it lends itself to pulse compression.

Reference-contexts: The previous set of simulations in [9] had " ?n = :3 mm mrad due to smaller volumes and larger accelerating fields. The bunch had about 3: fi 10 7 electrons in it, less than in 1-D <ref> [1] </ref>. The spot size of the electron bunch turned out to be smaller than the pump pulse due to the need to keep the electrons near the pump's axis. This change accounts for the difference between the 1-D and 2-D simulations.

Reference-contexts: 10. Previously published 2-D simulations used fl = 5 <ref> [9] </ref>. Background trapping obscured the trapping threshold, though the injection pulses' effect were observable. Therefore background reduction was needed. For this reason, the phase velocity of the wave was raised to fl = 10, thus the need for such a large simulation grid. <p> In the 2-D simulation presented, this quantity had a value of 1 2 mm mrad, and was found to be constant over the simulation. The best RF guns have a value of ~ 1 mm mrad, on the same order of magnitude [20]. The previous set of simulations in <ref> [9] </ref> had " ?n = :3 mm mrad due to smaller volumes and larger accelerating fields. The bunch had about 3: fi 10 7 electrons in it, less than in 1-D [1].

Reference-contexts: The dotted vertical line is the center of the injection pulse, showing the trapped electron initially pushed in the negative z direction. This orbit can actually be calculated by looking at how the ponderomotive potential effects the wave <ref> [15] </ref>. These pictures match reasonably well with Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 from the previous section, showing that all methods of analysis match each other. Finally Figs. 16 and 17 deal with transverse motion during the trapping process.

Reference-contexts: Oscillating particles will see two frequencies as they move into the vacuum and return, causing them to be dephased, and possibly trapped. This was studied previously by two other groups <ref> [19] </ref>. We chose to use the solution of G. Bonnaud et. al. to remove this problem from the code, and moved the particle boundary accordingly. This was tested in set one, and removed almost all background trapping from the simulation.

However, the peak currents are comparable since the pulse duration is so short. The parameters for this simulation were chosen to match initial experiments, not optimal electron gun performance.
