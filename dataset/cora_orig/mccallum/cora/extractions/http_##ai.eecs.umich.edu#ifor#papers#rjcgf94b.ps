Abstract: One of the most important tasks in a tactical engagement is to maintain awareness of the current situation. This is as true for simulated intelligent agents as it is for humans in real engagements. We have identified two key capabilities that are required for maintaining situational awareness: managing and synthesizing information from a variety of information sources, and correctly identifying and sorting engagement participants into an appropriate mental representation. This paper discusses our efforts in addressing these capabilities within the TacAir-Soar system. An intelligent simulated agent must be able to observe and interpret the world it is operating in. This includes observing how the world reacts to behaviors generated by the agent, as well as behaviors generated by other agents within the simulation. As the world changes, the agent must continuously build and maintain a "mental picture" of the world's current state (i.e., maintain situational awareness). Otherwise there is no hope of generating appropriate behaviors to In earlier work (Jones, Tambe, Laird, & Rosenbloom, 1993) we concentrated on building agents that generated reasonable behavior given rather strong assumptions about world information. The past TacAir-Soar agent assumed that there were at most two agents operating in the simulated tactical air environment: the agent itself and one potential enemy. In addition, the agent had only two sources of information: cockpit controls reported information about the agent's vehicle and weapons, and a radar reported information about the other participant in the environment.
