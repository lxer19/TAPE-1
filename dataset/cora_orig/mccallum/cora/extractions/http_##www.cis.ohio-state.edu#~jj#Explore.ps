Reference-contexts: The total time on a serial machine for performing exhaustive evaluation will be about 6 days. Because of time requirements of this sort, we developed a novel computational architecture that employs Modula-3 (Cardelli, et. al., 1990) network objects <ref> (Birrell, et. al., 1994) </ref> to make use of the distributed computing environments that are commonly available in engineering institutions nowadays. The architecture is illustrated in Figure 3.

Reference-contexts: Ways of displaying and interacting with data in higher numbers of dimensions would be worth investigating. (See, for example, Tufte, 1983, 1990.) Automated clustering algorithms could identify interesting properties in the higher-dimensional spaces <ref> (Jain and Dubes, 1988) </ref>. Higher-dimensional spatial analysis algorithms might be applied to identify outliers (Yip and F. Zhao, 1996). Outliers tend to have interesting properties, good or bad. Experimental Results We will now describe a set of experiments in designspace exploration that we have conducted in a real-world domain.

Reference-contexts: The Domain. The domain in which we performed our experiments was that of hybrid electric vehicles. Hybrid electric vehicles are automobiles that use both an electrical motor and an internal-combustion (IC) engine as power sources. <ref> (See Wouk, 1997, for an introduction to the problem area.) </ref> Electrical motors are attractive as power source partially because of the potential for using the motor as a generator during braking and thus recapturing the kinetic energy of the vehicle., They also have good emission properties, making them attractive for city
