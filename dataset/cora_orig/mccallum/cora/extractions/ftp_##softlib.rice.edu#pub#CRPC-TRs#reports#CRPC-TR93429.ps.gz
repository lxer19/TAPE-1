Reference-contexts: language [2], its theoretical foundations [1], and a Fortran M compiler developed at Argonne National Laboratory [3]. 2 Syntax Backus-Naur form (BNF) is used to present new syntax, with nonterminal symbols in slanted font, terminal symbols in TYPEWRITER font, and symbols defined in Appendix F of the Fortran 77 standard <ref> [4] </ref> underlined. The syntax [symbol ] is used to represent zero or more comma-separated occurrences of symbol ; [symbol ] (1) represents one or more occurrences. fl This research was supported in part by the Office of Scientific Computing, U.S.
