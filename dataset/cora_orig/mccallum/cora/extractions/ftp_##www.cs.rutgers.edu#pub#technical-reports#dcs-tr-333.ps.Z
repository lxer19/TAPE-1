Title: On Providing Support for Protocol Adaptation in Mobile Wireless Networks

Abstract: The availability of a variety of communication devices offers a choice among networks with vastly different characteristics. A mobile host is likely to encounter these different networks and no single protocol or application can be expected to perform well under all these networks. The problem of adapting to a changing network environment is further complicated by the fact that changes in network conditions are usually transparent to the applications. In order to allow automatic adaptation of applications and protocols, awareness of link conditions and network environment is required. In this paper we present a uniform mechanism based on ICMP messages for providing environmental information to all the network protocol layers. We also show how applications and protocols can adapt to changes in the environment and in particular, demonstrate dynamic fine tuning of some of the well known protocols such as UDP and TCP. Performance measurements demonstrate that our mechanism imposes very little overhead and results in better performance of protocols that can adapt to changing network conditions.

It is also conceivable that hosts that communicate with mobile hosts are aware of mobility. In such cases, some other type of adaptations <ref> [15, 18, 1] </ref> are possible. 9 Conclusion The results in this paper shows that it is possible to make network information available to applications and protocol stack with little processing overheads.

Reference-contexts: This will lead to problems if losses are really because of congestion. However, in this experiment, TCP end points are the end points of the wireless link. Thus, losses were real losses. In other cases, same modification can be used if losses can be detected <ref> [2] </ref>. (Note that loss is another device parameter). 5.4 TCP adaptation: Receiver A similar simple adaptation is possible when the mobile host is the receiver. Whenever a handoff takes place, the sender backs off due to losses during the handoff.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction With advances in technology, a variety of communication devices like Ethernet, Wavelan, Range-lan, modems, CDPD, cellular modems etc. have become available at affordable prices. It is not uncommon for a laptop to have access to more than one kind of network <ref> [3] </ref>. All these technologies offer different network characteristics. Ethernet and wireless LAN offer inexpensive high bandwidth communication but limited coverage. Cellular modems and CDPD on the other hand offer very low bandwidth and wide area coverage but at high cost. Satellite channels offer high latency asymmetric links. <p> The mechanism presented in this paper allows all such bindings. In some cases, the handoffs may be across different types of networks. Moving from an Ethernet to satellite communication can increase the asymmetry of the network. The BARWAN project <ref> [3] </ref> at the University of California, Berkeley suggests how applications can take various actions when such changes occur.

Reference-contexts: However, in wireless networks, losses usually are real losses. So, when the conditions improve, TCP can safely resume normal flow. * Send duplicate ACKs when a loss is detected (TCP DUPACKS): Three duplicate ACKs will start a fast retransmit on the sender side <ref> [4] </ref>. If losses are known to be real losses, this can be used to initiate retransmission on the sender side without waiting for the coarse timeout. Additional duplicate ACKs can be used to open up the congestion window at the sender.

Reference-contexts: In case of protocol adaptation, TCP has been very widely studied. Numerous flavors of TCP have been suggested for dealing with various network conditions. TCP for space communication [8], header compression in wireless environment [6], semi-connected TCP/IP [10] are just a few examples. Adaptation for mobile IP <ref> [5] </ref> has also been proposed. Allowing applications to control protocol behavior [9, 12] has also been studied. 8 Future Work To allow a very generic adaptation, work is needed on providing support for hysteresis and deciding a set of actions for various transport layer protocols.

Reference-contexts: Base stations as well as mobile hosts use 2Mbps Wavelan technology for wireless communication. In addition, base stations have a wired interface to 10 Mbps Ethernet. To support mobility, mobile IP code developed at State University of New York at Binghamton <ref> [7] </ref> is used. This section shows how some simple actions are effective in improving performance of the well known protocols like UDP and TCP. These are by no means the only actions that are possible.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, a mobile host may connect to a satellite link which has long latencies. Also, for satellite links, the ratio of uplink bandwidth to downlink bandwidth can be fairly large. This has a significant impact on TCP performance <ref> [8] </ref>. Different locations may need communication with different proxies and location dependent applications may have to contact a different server when the location changes. Limited energy supply may force network protocols to be energy efficient [13, 19, 20, 11].

Reference-contexts: At the same time, these parameters can vary suddenly and drastically. Existing support is not sufficient for adapting to these new parameters. Many variations of TCP have been proposed to deal with specific networks. TCP for space communication [16], TCP over SLIP <ref> [14] </ref> are some examples. However, having a new TCP for every possible network does not help when network conditions change dynamically. We need the ability to automatically change 5 protocol behavior without significant overhead.

Reference-contexts: A natural way to communicate this information to a protocol layer is to generate an ICMP message. ICMP messages have already been used for propagating network availability information <ref> [16] </ref>. Here, we use ICMP messages for reporting changes in all device related parameters. Using ICMP messages to propagate environment aware information offers distinct advantages. ICMP messages are generic, efficient and already exist. <p> However, mobility introduces many more parameters that need to be considered. At the same time, these parameters can vary suddenly and drastically. Existing support is not sufficient for adapting to these new parameters. Many variations of TCP have been proposed to deal with specific networks. TCP for space communication <ref> [16] </ref>, TCP over SLIP [14] are some examples. However, having a new TCP for every possible network does not help when network conditions change dynamically. We need the ability to automatically change 5 protocol behavior without significant overhead. <p> A good action set should enable us to select any of these easily. 7 Related Work Mechanisms for making applications aware of the network conditions has been suggested in the literature.
