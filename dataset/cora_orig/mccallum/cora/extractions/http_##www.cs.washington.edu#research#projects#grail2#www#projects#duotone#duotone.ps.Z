Abstract: We investigate a new approach for reproducing color images. Rather than mapping the colors in an image onto the gamut of colors that can be printed with cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks, we choose the set of printing inks for the particular image being reproduced. In this paper, we look at the special case of selecting inks for duotone printing, a relatively inexpensive process in which just two inks are used. Specifically, the system we describe takes an image as input, and allows a user to select 0, 1, or 2 inks. It then chooses the remaining ink or inks so as to reproduce the image as accurately as possible and produces the appropriate color separations automatically.

The computer graphics community is more familiar with the RGB color space, an additive color space that is device-dependent. <p> The computer graphics community is more familiar with the RGB color space, an additive color space that is device-dependent. Conversion between RGB and XYZ coordinates can be accomplished by a linear transform if the XYZ coordinates of the device's red, green and blue primaries are known <ref> [2, pages 585-587] </ref>. In contrast to additive color spaces, perceptually uniform color spaces allow the difference between two colors (as perceived by the human eye) to be measured as the distance between points. <p> the spectral reflectance information for the paper, the individual inks on paper, and the combination of both inks on paper, we can find the printing primaries g 0 , g 1 , g 2 , and g 1,2 by first converting the appropriate spectral quantities to XYZ or RGB coordinates <ref> [2, pages 579-587] </ref>. 3.2 Goals of duotone mapping The core of our algorithm is the mapping that transforms image colors onto the duotone gamut. There are many characteristics of colors and of sets of colors that one could seek to preserve in designing a mapping. <p> Preserving separation of image colors along this direction of greatest sensitivity, called the luminance direction, is the primary goal of our duotone mapping. The Y axis of the XYZ color space corresponds exactly to the luminance direction <ref> [2] </ref>, and therefore we take Y to be the direction of our first transformation. (Stone et al. also used preservation of relative luminance in their gamut mapping work [21].) 2. Preserve ink-spread separation.

Reference-contexts: Fundamentally, a duotone gamut is much more restricted than the gamut of a typical output device. Our duotone mapping differs from the approaches taken by Stone et al.

Each version, known as a halftone separation, consists of various sized dots of a single ink. <p> Thus the hue angle of a color is defined as h uv = tan 1 (v fl =u fl ) or h ab = tan 1 (b fl =a fl ) <ref> [4, page 65] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A number of approaches have been suggested for mitigating this problem, including methods for smoothly mapping the original image colors to the process color gamut [21], and, in the case of three-dimensional computer-synthesized imagery, redefining the original object colors so that the rendered image will lie inside the process-color gamut <ref> [5] </ref>. However, to our knowledge, there has been no research to date on a very different but equally promising approach: allowing the inks used for printing to be selected for the particular image being reproduced.

Reference-contexts: Applying UCR to a color is fairly simple: a fraction of the minimum component of cyan, magenta, and yellow is removed from all three components, and then replaced by an equal amount of black <ref> [13] </ref>. The success of this technique hinges on the fact that cyan, magenta, and yellow combine to black, a property that is not necessarily true for the two inks used in a duotone.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the selection of one or two inks amounts to an optimization problem whose goal (or objective) function is a function of the original image and two inks. Simulated annealing is a heuristic optimization technique designed to avoid local minima <ref> [18] </ref>. Transitions from the current state to an 5 other state are generated randomly and accepted with some proba-bility. This acceptance probability depends both on the relative scores of the two states, as rated by the objective function, and on the value of a control parameter T.

Reference-contexts: Thus, color fidelity must generally be compromised when reproducing images with process colors (or any other small, fixed set of inks). A number of approaches have been suggested for mitigating this problem, including methods for smoothly mapping the original image colors to the process color gamut <ref> [21] </ref>, and, in the case of three-dimensional computer-synthesized imagery, redefining the original object colors so that the rendered image will lie inside the process-color gamut [5]. <p> Fundamentally, a duotone gamut is much more restricted than the gamut of a typical output device.

The second relationship our 3 g 0 g 2 Y P mapping preserves is separation in the direction of most color variation on the duotone gamut.

Reference-contexts: The difference is caused by adaptation effects in the visual system, which allow a sub tle color to be perceived as white when nothing perceptually closer to white is present <ref> [22] </ref>. We are currently investigating quantitative models of adaptation that might improve a duotone surrounded by an expanse of colored paper. 6 Results We have implemented an application that allows a user to create duotone separations. <p> Our extension of the optimization algorithm to choose a paper as well as inks suggests that we should adjust our algorithm to take advantage of psychophysical effects such as von Kries adaptation <ref> [22] </ref> and simultaneous contrast. These effects may allow us to effectively expand the printing gamut by tricking the eye into seeing colors that are not actually achievable. Another possible extension to our implementation is a system that facilitates the production of two-color brochures by optimizing over images, inks, and papers.

Adding a black separation to duotone printing offers a further benefit: for images with a wide range of luminance values, the two colored inks no longer need to be chosen so that their combination is close to black.
