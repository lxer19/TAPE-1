Abstract: In this paper we present a new approach to three-dimensional capacitance extraction based on a pre-corrected FFT scheme. The approach is compared to the now commonly used multipole-accelerated algorithms for a variety of structures, and the new method is shown to have substantial performance and memory advantages.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the design of high performance integrated circuits and integrated circuit packaging, there are many cases where accurate estimates of the capacitances of complicated three-dimensional structures are important for determining final circuit speeds and functionality. Algorithms using method of moments <ref> [1] </ref> based discretizations of integral equation formulations are commonly used to compute these capacitances, but such approaches generate dense matrix problems which are computationally expensive to solve, and this limits the complexity of problems which can be analyzed.

Reference-contexts: In [2], a rapid method, based on the hierarchical multipole algorithm <ref> [3] </ref>, for computing the capacitance of three-dimensional structures was presented. <p> Several sparsifica-tion techniques for P are based on the idea of directly computing only those portions of P q associated with interactions between panels in neighboring cubes. The rest of P q is then somehow approximated to accelerate the computation <ref> [3] </ref>. One approach to computing distant interactions is to exploit the fact that evaluation points distant from a cube can be accurately computed by representing the given cube's charge distribution using a small number of weighted point charges.

Reference-contexts: To avoid the O (n 3 ) cost of solving (2) withe Gaussian elimination, iterative solvers such as GMRES <ref> [5] </ref> are commonly used. The dominant costs of using GMRES to solve (2) are in calculating the n 2 entries of P using (3) before the iterations begin, and performing n 2 operations to compute a matrix-vector product on each iteration.
