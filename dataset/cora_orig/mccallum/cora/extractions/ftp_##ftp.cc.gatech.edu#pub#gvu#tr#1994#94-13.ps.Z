Abstract: Birds, fish, and many other animals are able to move gracefully and efficiently as a herd, flock, or school. We would like to reproduce this behavior for herds of artificial creatures with significant dynamics. This paper develops an algorithm for grouping behaviors and evaluates the performance of the algorithm on two types of systems: a full dynamic simulation of a legged robot that must balance as well as move with the herd and a point mass with minimal dynamics. Robust control algorithms for group behaviors of dynamic systems will allow us to generate realistic motion for animation using high-level controls, to develop synthetic actors for use in virtual environments, mobile robotics, and perhaps to improve our understanding of the behavior of biological systems.

Reference-contexts: Simulations for up to four point-mass robots demonstrate that these navigation strategies can produce stable group formations. Arkin explored the question of communication in a group of interacting mobile robots using schema-based reactive control <ref> (Arkin 1992, Arkin and Hobbs 1992) </ref>. Example schemas are move-to-goal, move-ahead, and avoid-static-obstacle. Each behavior computes a velocity vector that is combined with the velocity vectors from the other behaviors and is used to control the robot.

Reference-contexts: A further extension would be to develop "personalities" for the individuals as Bates did in his woggles simulation <ref> (Bates et al 1993) </ref>. In the case of the dynamic robot simulation, a simple personality might consist of adjustments to the gains in the herding algorithm and the locomotion control system so that the robot appears to behave in an aggressive or timid fashion.

Reference-contexts: These robots, like Arkin's, do not explicitly communicate state or goals and the system has no leaders. This work demonstrated that combinations of such simple behaviors as attraction and repulsion can produce complex relationships such as dispersion and flocking in physical robots in the laboratory <ref> (Mataric 1992a,b) </ref>. The robots utilize the knowledge that they are all identical when executing behaviors, but an extension to these results found that heterogeneous agents do not perform significantly better than homogeneous ones (1993).
