Abstract: We describe logarithmic times optimal approximation algorithms for the NP-hard graph optimization problems of minimum linear arrangement, minimum containing interval graph, and minimum storage-time product. This improves on the best previous approximation bounds of Even, Naor, Rao, and Schieber for these problems by an (log log n) factor. Even, Naor, Rao, and Schieber defined "spreading metrics" for each of the ordering problems above (and to other problems); for each of these problems, they provided a spreading metric of volume W , such that W is a lower bound on the cost of a solution to the problem. They used this spreading metric to find a solution of cost O(W log n log log n) (for simplicity, assume that all tasks have unit processing time in the minimum storage-time product problem). In this paper, we show how to find a solution within a logarithmic factor times W for these problems. We develop a recursion where at each level we identify cost which, if incurred, yields subproblems with reduced spreading metric volume. Specifically, we present a divide-and-conquer strategy where the cost of a solution to a problem at a recursive level is C plus the cost of a solution to the subproblems at this level, and where the spreading metric volume on the subproblems is less than the original volume by (C= log n). This ensures that the resulting solution has cost O(log n) times the original spreading metric volume. We note that this is an existentially tight bound on the relationship between the spreading metric volume W and the true optimal values for these problems. For planar graphs, we combine a structural theorem of Klein, Plotkin, and Rao with our new recursion technique to show that the spreading metric cost volumes are within an O(log log n) factor of the cost of an optimal solution for the minimum linear arrangement, and the minimum containing interval graph problems.

Reference-contexts: We present a polynomial time O (log n)-approximation algorithm for the minimum linear arrangement problem on a graph with n nodes. This improves the best previous approximation bound of Even, Naor, Rao, and Schieber <ref> [1] </ref> for this problem by a O (log log n) factor. <p> host network H by embedding G into H. (For a more complete discussion of emulations and embeddings, see [8].). 1 2 Using techniques from [12], we can view the minimum containing interval graph problem (which we define formally later) as a "vertex version" of the minimum linear arrangement problem (see <ref> [1] </ref>). Thus, we also obtain an O (log n)-approximation algorithm for general graphs, and an O (log log n)-approximation algorithm for graphs that exclude fixed K r;r -minors for this problem. This improves on previous bounds of O (log n log log n) [1] for general graphs, and O (log n) <p> of the minimum linear arrangement problem (see <ref> [1] </ref>). Thus, we also obtain an O (log n)-approximation algorithm for general graphs, and an O (log log n)-approximation algorithm for graphs that exclude fixed K r;r -minors for this problem. This improves on previous bounds of O (log n log log n) [1] for general graphs, and O (log n) for graphs that exclude fixed K r;r -minors. <p> can also use techniques from [12] to extend our ideas to produce an O (log T )-approximation for the minimum storage-time product problem (where T is the sum of the processing times of all tasks), improving on a previous approximation bound of O (log T log log T ) in <ref> [1] </ref>. Alon and Seymour [13] proved that there exists a logarithmic gap between the spreading metric cost volumes, and the true optimal values for certain instances of the problems of minimum linear arrangement, minimum containing interval graph, and minimum storage-time product. <p> Seymour [13] was the first to present a directed graph decomposition divide-and-conquer approach that does not rely on balanced cuts. He presented a polynomial time O (log n log log n)-approximation algorithm for the minimum feedback arc set problem. Even, Naor, Rao, and Schieber <ref> [1] </ref> extended the spreading metric approach used by Seymour to obtain polynomial time O (log n log log n)-approximation algorithms for the minimum linear arrangement, and the minimum contain ing interval graph problems, and an O (log T log log T )- approximation algorithm minimum storage-time product problem. <p> Examples of such problems, besides the ones already mentioned, are: graph embeddings in d-dimensional meshes, symmetric multi-cuts in directed networks, multiway separators and - separators (for small values of ) in directed graphs. For a detailed description of each of those problems, see <ref> [1] </ref>. Even, Naor, Rao, and Schieber [2] extended the spreading metric techniques to graph partitioning problems. They used simpler recursions that yield a logarithmic approximation factor for balanced cuts and multi-way separators. <p> They used simpler recursions that yield a logarithmic approximation factor for balanced cuts and multi-way separators. However, they were not able to extend this simpler technique to obtain a logarithmic approximation bound for the other problems considered in <ref> [1] </ref>. 1.2 Spreading Metrics and Our Recursion. Our algorithms use an approach that relies on spreading met-rics. Spreading metrics have been used in recent divide-and-conquer techniques to obtain improved approximation algorithms for several graph optimization problems that are NP-hard [1]. <p> obtain a logarithmic approximation bound for the other problems considered in <ref> [1] </ref>. 1.2 Spreading Metrics and Our Recursion. Our algorithms use an approach that relies on spreading met-rics. Spreading metrics have been used in recent divide-and-conquer techniques to obtain improved approximation algorithms for several graph optimization problems that are NP-hard [1]. These techniques perform the divide step according to the cost of a solution to the sub-problems generated, rather than according to the size of such subproblems. <p> The volume of the spreading metric is the sum, taken over all edges (resp., nodes), of the length of each edge (resp., node) multiplied by its weight. Even, Naor, Rao, and Schieber <ref> [1] </ref> showed how to find a spreading metric of volume W such that W is a lower bound on the cost of a solution to the optimization problem. <p> The crux of the argument is that the cost associated with an edge in a cutset can be bounded by the number of nodes between the previous and the next cutset in the sequence. We point out that the methods in <ref> [1] </ref> applied to more problems, including the d-dimensional graph embedding, and the minimum feedback arc set problems [13]. <p> This is very similar to the MLA problem, except that the nodes are stretched along the order rather than the edges (see <ref> [1] </ref>). Thus, our techniques also apply to this problem. This problem arises in several areas, from computer science, to biology (see [10]), to archeology (e.g., when finding a consistent chronological model for tool use while making as few assumptions as possible [6]). 3 Spreading Metric. <p> In this section, we define the spreading metric used in the algorithms for the MLA problem presented in Sections 4 and 5. Analogous functions are used when approximating the minimum storage-time product problem (as presented in Section 6), and the minimum containing interval graph problem (see <ref> [1] </ref>). Here we present spreading metrics in the context of the MLA problem (see [1] for a more general definition). A spreading metric is a function ` : E ! Q that assigns rational lengths to every edge in E, and that can be computed in polynomial time. <p> Analogous functions are used when approximating the minimum storage-time product problem (as presented in Section 6), and the minimum containing interval graph problem (see <ref> [1] </ref>). Here we present spreading metrics in the context of the MLA problem (see [1] for a more general definition). A spreading metric is a function ` : E ! Q that assigns rational lengths to every edge in E, and that can be computed in polynomial time. It also has to satisfy the following two properties. <p> The distances induced by the spreading metric "spread" the graph and all its nontrivial subgraphs. In this application, this translates to "The diameter of every nontrivial connected subgraph U of V is (jU j)". A solution ` to (3.1-3.2) is a spreading metric for the MLA (see <ref> [1] </ref>). <p> Note that (3.1) actually implies that `(e) 1, for all e in E (simply consider the subsets U that consist of a single edge and its endpoints). A solution ` to (3.1-3.2) that minimizes P e2E w (e)`(e) is a lower bound on the cost of a MLA (see <ref> [1] </ref>). We will use this fact later, when proving Theorems 4.1 and 5.1. Let ` be a spreading metric of volume W = P e2E w (e)`(e) that satisfies (3.1-3.2). In the remaining of this paper all the distances in G are measured with respect to `. 4 The Algorithm. <p> We can choose ` fl such that ` fl satisfies (3.1-3.2), and whose volume W fl minimizes P e2E w (e)`(e), over all spreading metrics ` that satisfy (3.1-3.2). Even, Naor, Rao, and Schieber <ref> [1] </ref> showed that W fl is a lower bound on the cost of a MLA. Hence, by Lemma 4.1 and the considerations that follow this lemma, we have proved the following theorem: Theorem 4.1. <p> Now we group the leveled cuts according to their indices. Let fi k = W 2 k =(s log n), for all k in <ref> [1; 2 log log n] </ref>. Let fi 0 = 0 and fi (2 log log n) = W . <p> Here we define dist (u; v) to be the length of a shortest path from u to v in G 0 according to the lengths `(e) for e 2 E, and where each e 2 E R has length 0. As shown in <ref> [1] </ref>, the value of W is a lower bound on the optimal cost of a solution to the storage-time product problem. Given the spreading metric constraints above we can apply the algorithm of Section 4 to this problem as 8 follows. Let T = P v2V t (v). <p> It would be interesting to extend our techniques to obtain O (log n) approximation factors for other problems. In particular, it seems natural to extend our techniques to improve the best known approximation factors for other problems that satisfy the "approximation paradigm" of <ref> [1] </ref>. We would then provide an existentially tight bound | on the ratio between the value of an optimal solution and the spreading metric volume | for any such problem. However, since the approach used here depends on the structure of graph ordering problems, new ideas may be required.

Reference-contexts: The second inequality follows from the induction hypothesis; the fourth inequality follows since ff k+1 = 2ff k . We still need to show how to bring the approximation factor down from O (log W ) to O (log n). The basic ideas used here follow <ref> [3] </ref>. Our goal will be to reduce, by rescaling and rounding down weights, our original input graph G to an "equivalent" input graph G 0 whose spreading metric volume is a polynomial in n. Consider the set E 0 of edges e such that w (e) W=(mn).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction. We describe approximation algorithms that apply to the NP-hard graph optimization problems of minimum linear arrangement, minimum containing interval graph, and minimum storage-time product <ref> [4] </ref>. An ff-approximation algorithm is an algorithm that finds a solution to the problem whose cost is at most ff times the cost of an optimal solution to the problem. <p> When all tasks have unit execution time, it becomes the directed MLA problem. It is also a generalization of the single-processor scheduling problem, if we are minimizing the weighted sum of completion times (this problem is NP-complete <ref> [4, problem SS13, page 240] </ref>). 2.3 Minimum Containing Interval Graph. We first introduce the interval graphs.

Reference-contexts: We obtain this improvement by combining the techniques used for the general case with the algorithm presented by Klein, Plotkin, and Rao <ref> [7] </ref> for finding separators in graphs that exclude fixed K r;r -minors. 1 An embedding of a graph G into a graph H maps nodes of G to nodes of H, and edges of G to paths in H. <p> Finally, for planar graphs and other graphs that exclude some fixed minors, we combine a structural theorem of Klein, Plotkin and Rao <ref> [7] </ref> with our new recursion techniques, to show that the spreading metric cost volumes are within an O (log log n) factor of the cost of the optimal solution for the minimum linear arrangement, and the minimum containing interval graph problems. 1.3 Overview. <p> Then [ v A v is said to be an H-minor of G. Klein, Plotkin, and Rao <ref> [7] </ref>, showed how to decompose (in polynomial time) a graph with no K r;r -minors into connected components of small diameter. In our application, this implies that each connected component has at most a constant fraction of the nodes in G, as shown in the next section. 5.1 The Algorithm. <p> Suppose we just performed a series of r SPL's and corresponding cut procedures. The last cut performed, on G r1 , generated a collection of connected components of G r1 . Klein, Plotkin, and Rao <ref> [7] </ref> proved that the distance in G between any pair of nodes in any such component is O (s) (where the constant in the O () notation depends only on r).
