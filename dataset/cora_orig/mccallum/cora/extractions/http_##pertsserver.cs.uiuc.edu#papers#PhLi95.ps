Abstract: This paper presents the budgeted-weighted-round-robin (BWRR) algorithm for scheduling the transmission of hard-real-time messages in a packet-switched network. The BWRR algorithm provides a bound on the worst case delay of a message through the network. In addition, with the BWRR algorithm, the necessary buffer space at each switch is predictable and can be fixed at system configuration time. The per switch delay and required buffer space provided by the BWRR algorithm are significantly less than those provided by previous methods. The BWRR algorithm has a simple hardware implementation and admission test, and it does not require a global clock or any explicit flow control messages. It can achieve high utilization of the network under most practical scenarios and reacts predictably under transient overloads.

Reference-contexts: The problem of scheduling real-time messages in packet-switched networks has been studied extensively in recent years. Some of the algorithms that have been proposed are: Delay Earliest-Due-Date (D-EDD) [3], Jitter Earliest-Due-Date (J-EDD) [9], Virtual Clock (VC) [12], Fair Queuing (FQ) <ref> [2] </ref>, Rate-Controlled Static-Priority Queuing (RCSP) [10], Stop-and-Go (S&G) [4], and Hierarchical-Round Robin (HRR) [5, 8].

Their disadvantage is that their implementation is more complicated. In this paper, we present a modification of the weighted-round-robin (WRR) <ref> [2, 7, 6] </ref> algorithm, called the budgeted-weighted-round-robin (BWRR) algorithm, for scheduling real-time messages in a multihop packet-switched network. The WRR algorithm cycles through the message streams transmitting a limited number of packets from each stream, thus guaranteeing each stream a minimum fraction of the transmission bandwidth. <p> is admitted to the network if and only if it can be scheduled on each hop so that its end-to-end delay is no more than its deadline and its admission does not cause messages from other streams to miss their deadlines. 3 WRR Scheduling According to the WRR scheduling algorithm <ref> [2, 7, 6] </ref>, a weight w i is assigned to each message stream M i such that the sum of the w i is less than or equal to some integer C which we call the scheduler cycle time. The scheduler transmits packets from the message streams in cyclic order.

What we have shown in this section is that high average utilization of the network is achieved over message streams with periods that differ by four or five orders of magnitude.

The scheduler transmits packets from the message streams in cyclic order. <p> Hence, according to the WRR algorithm, the actual length of each cycle is at most equal to C but can be less than C. A description of a WRR hardware scheduler can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>. By an appropriate assignment of the weights, the WRR algorithm can guarantee that each M i is given at least c i slots within every period p i . <p> The scheduler sets the variable to w i when it begins to transmit packets from M i and continues to transmit from M i as long as the variable is greater than zero <ref> [6] </ref>. To implement the BWRR algorithm, we also use such a variable, called bgt i , for each message stream M i which gives the budget of packets that M i may transmit. As packets from M i are transmitted, bgt i is decremented.

In S&G and HRR, time is explicitly fragmented into fixed size frames. <p> We now state a theorem and a corollary that state upper bounds on the end-to-end delay incurred by a periodic message scheduled according to the WRR algorithm. Their proofs can be found in the appendix. Similar results can be found in <ref> [11] </ref> in the analysis of the FQ algorithm. However, our results are stated slightly differently, i.e., in terms of the periodic message model. We include them to make the paper complete and also to provide a basis for comparison of the WRR and BWRR algorithm. <p> We say that two message instances have zero jitter if their interdelivery time to the destination is equal to the period of the message stream. Jitter, then, is the absolute value of the difference of the interdelivery times and the period. From the analysis of work-conserving schedulers in <ref> [11] </ref>, we can conclude that Theorem 2 The worst case jitter for a message transmitted on an L-hop packet-switched network according to the WRR algorithm is p i c i + (L 1)(C 1). <p> A closely related problem with the WRR algorithm is the excessive buffer usage which also grows with the number of hops as is stated by the following theorem <ref> [11] </ref>. Theorem 3 The maximum buffer space required for a message stream M i at hop L when scheduled according to the WRR algorithm is (1 + dC (L 1)=p i e)c i packets.
