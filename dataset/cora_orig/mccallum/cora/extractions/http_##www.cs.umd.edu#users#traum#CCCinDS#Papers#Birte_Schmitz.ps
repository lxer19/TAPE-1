Abstract: This paper starts from the assumption that collaboration is a fundamental prerequisite of dialogues. This view is applied to a special instance of human-human dialogues that are mediated by an interpreter. I demonstrate how this situation differs from a normal human- human-dialogue situation: The responsibility for mutual understanding and the control over the dialogue lies with the interpreter. The paper then focuses on the question how a human- human dialogue mediated (i.e. interpreted) by a machine can be adequately modeled. Based on the assumption that the machine cannot bear the responsibility for understanding, I propose certain strategies to compensate for the ma

Reference-contexts: The change of roles is usually manifested by a code change (marked by para-linguistic phenomena such as loudness or the change from first to third person). This view of the role of the interpreter as both a translator and a coordinator is also taken in <ref> [ Apfelbaum, Wadensjoe 97 ] </ref> . The interpreter's role as a coordinator is demonstrated with the following example taken from a Verbmobil dialogue that was a recorded and transliterated role play with two primary interactants and a human interpreter.

Reference-contexts: understand here by liaison interpreting is the immediate translation of each speaker's contribution in a conversation, discussion or similar exchange between two or more individuals speaking different languages. [ Zahner 90, S.297 ] How can the task of the interpreter be characterized? In accordance to a relevance-theoretic approach to translation <ref> [ Gutt 91 ] </ref> , it is the task of the translator or interpreter to produce a target-language utterance that enables the hearer in the target language to infer the originally intended interpretation. In this view the interpreter is responsible for the successful communication.

Reference-contexts: In this view the interpreter is responsible for the successful communication. In liaison interpreting the interpreter is co-present in the dialogue situation. According to <ref> [ Keith 84 ] </ref> liaison interpreting includes three different dialogues: * one macro-dialogue between the primary interac- tants. This dialogue is mediated by the interpreter. * two micro-dialogues, one between speaker A and the interpreter and one between speaker B and the in <p>- terpreter respectively.

Reference-contexts: This is usually done by compositionally applying linguistic rules. Generally the semantic representation is an incomplete logical form. Sperber and Wilson define a logical form as "a well-formed formula, a structured set of constituents, which undergoes formal logical operations determined by its structure" <ref> [ Sperber, Wilson 86 ] </ref> . Its incompleteness is reflected by the fact that it contains unbound variables, ambiguous expressions and elliptical material. Only after applying contextual processes that resolve these indeterminacies a complete logical form (or explicature) is derived. <p> In the following part of a discourse the intended interpretation of (9) is (10) and (11). (8) Can we meet next week? (9) I will already be on a holiday then. (10) We cannot meet when your are on a holiday. (11) We cannot meet next week. According to <ref> [ Sperber, Wilson 86 ] </ref> (10) is the implicated premise, (11) the implicated conclusion. The decision to express an utterance in such a way that its intended interpretation is an implicature relies on assumptions about the background knowledge of the hearer.

Reference-contexts: I propose strategies for both the machine and the users to compensate for the machine's lack of real collaborative activities. 2 Human-Human Dialogues Following approaches in conversational analysis I regard dialogues as social interactions. <ref> [ Stenstrom 94, p.1 ] </ref> characterizes spoken interaction as a here-and-now social activity which is governed by two main principles: * speakers take turns * speakers cooperate She adds that "When studying transcripts of genuine conversation one is struck by the general atmosphere of cooperativeness and harmony.
