Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction There has been a great deal of excitement in the field of quantum computing over the last few years, due largely to the result of Shor <ref> [1] </ref> showing that large numbers can be factored on a quantum computer in a time that scales polynomially with the number of digits. Shor's work was based on earlier results showing that certain oracle problems could be solved on a quantum computer exponentially faster than on a classical computer [2].

Reference-contexts: Shor's work was based on earlier results showing that certain oracle problems could be solved on a quantum computer exponentially faster than on a classical computer <ref> [2] </ref>. Since it is believed that factoring is an exponentially hard problem on a classical computer, Shor's result provided for the first time a concrete demonstration that quantum computers can achieve useful results much more efficiently than classical computers.

Reference-contexts: Despite a great deal of work in this field, however, there has been little progress toward discovering other algorithms which give the quantum computer an exponential advantage in performance. Early in the development of quantum computing, it was suggested by Feynman <ref> [3] </ref> that it might be possible to simulate quantum mechanical systems exponentially faster on quantum computers than on classical computers. Feynman argued that understanding this issue might help to quantify the differences between the computational capacities of classical and quantum computers.

Reference-contexts: Feynman argued that understanding this issue might help to quantify the differences between the computational capacities of classical and quantum computers. Recently, it was argued by Lloyd <ref> [4] </ref> that for a fairly general class of quantum systems, particularly for discrete systems, it should be possible to achieve an exponential speedup when simulating quantum mechanical systems on a quantum computer. In this paper we will discuss algorithms which are concrete realizations of these general arguments. <p> If this time-development operator can be reasonably approximated by a polynomial number of two-particle interactions, then such a system could be simulated on a quantum computer with an exponential performance increase using the methods discussed in <ref> [4] </ref>. Whether such a nonlocal approach to the simulation is preferable to the local QLGA method is not clear; further study of both approaches will probably be needed to resolve this issue. 5 Conclusions We have discussed algorithms for simulating quantum systems on quantum computers.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown <ref> [10] </ref> that such two-bit gates are universal for quantum computation. A measurement in a quantum computer is performed by measuring the states of some of the q-bits. It is sufficient to restrict attention to measurements of the states of individual spins with respect to the canonical basis.

Reference-contexts: The definition of a universal quantum computer is closely modeled on the conceptual framework of classical computation. It has been suggested <ref> [11] </ref> that a more general definition of a quantum computer may be desirable, as there may be physical systems which exhibit the 3 capacity for performing useful quantum computation which do not fit into this axiomatic framework. <p> Certainly, recent progress in quantum error correcting codes [25] gives some indication that there is room for optimism in this direction. Even if a true "universal quantum computer" can never be built, however, it may be possible to construct quantum devices which have some computational capacity <ref> [11] </ref>. Because the algorithms we have discussed here are based only on simple local quantum interactions, it seems plausible that many different types of quantum systems may be useful in simulating other quantum systems in a precise and relatively controlled fashion.

Reference-contexts: In particular, a lattice of spin-1/2 particles with a Hamiltonian proportional to the sum of exchange operations, as discussed in <ref> [13] </ref>, would lead to a very similar dynamics. Thus, it may be advantageous to consider a wider range of quantum computational devices in searching for algorithms for simulating generic quantum systems.

Reference-contexts: We have now seen that the dynamics (9) gives rise in the continuum limit to a Schrodinger equation for a single free particle moving in one dimension. A number of similar models have been considered previously by other authors. Essentially the same model was studied by Succi and Benzi <ref> [14] </ref>; a number of numerical experiments were performed on this model by Succi to study the emergent Schrodinger behavior in the continuum limit [15]. A closely related model was described by Feynman [16] in the context of the single particle Dirac equation in one spatial dimension.

Reference-contexts: A nice way of packaging the q-bits and kinetic time-development rule in d-dimensions is given by the general class of systems called Quantum Lattice-Gas Automata (QLGA) [8, 5]. These models are defined by analogy with classical lattice-gas automata <ref> [19] </ref> to be simple dynamical systems in which q-bits on a lattice undergo a time-development which consists of alternating propagation and collision steps.

Reference-contexts: It is possible to modify the algorithm to incorporate Fermi statistics, however this requires somewhat more bookkeeping. This issue was discussed in <ref> [20] </ref>. 3.6 Computational complexity We have now described a class of algorithms for simulating the nonrelativistic many-body Schrodinger equation on a quantum computer. <p> In discussing the computational complexity of these simulation algorithms, it is worth noting that if we simulate nonrelativistic fermions extra work must be done to keep track of the phase of the state. Using the bookkeeping method suggested in <ref> [20] </ref>, for example, we must define a canonical ordering for all the particles, and we must check to see when the propagation changes the ordering of any pair of particles.

Reference-contexts: Within the QLGA framework, in fact, it is not possible to construct a single-particle Dirac equation in any dimension d &gt; 1. A model suggested several years ago by Bialynicki-Birula <ref> [21] </ref>, however, fits very closely into the framework we have been discussing, and may provide a way of simulating systems of many Dirac particles without encountering the difficulties which have plagued previous efforts.

Reference-contexts: Remarkably, it seems that such a model cannot exist on the three-dimensional cartesian lattice. A Dirac particle is formed by taking two Weyl spinors and including a mass term by hand. As described by Bialynicki-Birula, the model avoids the no-go theorem of Nielsen and Ninomiya <ref> [22] </ref> because it has discrete time evolution. 17 The model of Bialynicki-Birula suffers from the same difficulty as the model with time- development operator (7) which we discussed in Section 3.2, and thus this algorithm cannot be implemented naturally on a universal quantum computer.

Reference-contexts: To do this, one would need to introduce antiparticles corresponding to negative energy states. Incorporating a potential directly into a Dirac theory is liable to be problematic, however, since the simplest interaction term, the four-fermi interaction, is nonrenormalizable and would destroy the continuum limit of the theory <ref> [23] </ref>. Of course, if one wishes to simulate interacting Dirac fermions, one is led naturally to the problem of simulating quantum gauge field theories.

Reference-contexts: The QLGA approach is naturally suited to describing second-quantized systems in a Hamiltonian framework, so such a model is probably best discussed in the context of Hamiltonian lattice methods <ref> [24] </ref>. There are several difficulties inherent in constructing a QLGA model of a quantum gauge theory. First, it is necessary to find a lattice rule which describes the propagation of a single particle according to Maxwell's equations.
