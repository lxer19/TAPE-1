Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for approximate input output decoupling of nonlinear MIMO systems which are either numerically ill posed or exhibit nearly singular behavior in the application of decoupling algorithms. Although the systems considered are regular, so that the exact decoupling algorithms are applicable in this case, they require inversion of an ill-conditioned matrix, and yield high gain feedback solutions which may result in actuator saturation and cancellation of high frequency zeros. The approximate algorithms of this paper are numerically robust, and provide solutions which do not cancel far off right half plane zeros. This latter characteristic is especially valuable when some of the far off right half plane zeros are unstable. The algorithms are inspired by and are generalizations of some examples in the flight control literature ([1], [2], [3]).

Reference-contexts: Further, the algorithm is not numerically robust since it requires the inverse of an ill conditioned matrix. In this paper, we propose a numerically robust input output decoupling algorithm for invertible nonlinear MIMO systems. Our efforts are motivated, in part, by the use in Hauser, et al <ref> [2] </ref>, the work of Singh [1],[3] of such techniques to aircraft flight control problems and the work of Barbot, et al [10] with applications to models of electric motors and the Belousov Zhabotinsky reaction kinetics. <p> Systems in which these far off zeros are in the right half plane are called slightly nonminimum phase systems in <ref> [2] </ref>. The approximate decoupling controller, in this case, results in a stable closed loop system. It is possible to develop several different approximate decoupling algorithms starting from the different decoupling algorithms in the literature. The algorithm presented here is based on the Descusse and Moog dynamic decoupling algorithm (see [6],[14]). <p> The cancellation of these far off zeros requires a large control effort resulting in a high gain controller. If these far off zeros are unstable then their cancellation makes the closed loop system unstable. These systems are referred to as slightly nonminimum phase systems in <ref> [2] </ref>. Application of the approximate decoupling algorithm to slightly nonminimum phase systems results in a stable closed loop system. 5 Approximate Asymptotic Tracking Input output decoupling is closely related to tracking of reference trajectories by the outputs of a MIMO nonlinear system. <p> by _e i = A i e i i = 1; ; m (23) where A i 2 &lt; ~fl e i fi~fl e i given by A i = 6 6 4 . . . i 1 i i 1 7 7 5 It can be shown (e.g. see <ref> [2] </ref>) that if * The reference trajectory and its derivatives are bounded and small enough. * Zero dynamics of (23) (i.e. the equilibrium point ~ 0 = 0 of the system) _ ~ = q (0; ~) + P (0; ~)~u e (0; ~; 0) (24) is exponentially stable * q <p> The following theorem shows that it works for the approximate system with nonzero * as well.
