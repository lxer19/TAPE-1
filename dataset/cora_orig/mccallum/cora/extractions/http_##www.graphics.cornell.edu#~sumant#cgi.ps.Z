Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient particle tracing method for interactive walk-through in a large environment. The efficiency is derived using the concept of importance similar to that used in importance driven radiosity. We propose the importance driven particle tracing as an add-on module to the standard particle tracing process, which is activated on demand as the user walks-through from one region to another in the environment. This module derives the importance information from the normal particle tracing process. Key Words: Radiance equation, Potential equation, Adjointness, Random Walk, Function Approximation, and Importance.

Reference-contexts: The illumination is estimated by tracking the particles during their propagation. The tracking of a particle amounts to carrying out the ray/environment intersection operation which is quite an well understood operation. This makes particle tracing an extremely simple method for implementation. The very first implementation of particle tracing <ref> [1] </ref> originated as the simulation of the particle model of light and using it view independent illumination of the environment was estimated by fitting piece-wise constant functions over the surfaces of the environment. Later, this simulation was related to the random walk solution of the potential equation [2, 3].

The particle tracing method using Multi-wavelets, provides techniques <ref> [4] </ref> such as: multi-resolution wavelet reconstruction (from the coefficients captured at higher resolution), projection to lower dimension (if the number of particles contributing to the estimates are statistically low) for carrying out this reconstruction.

Reference-contexts: All these improvements make particle tracing a powerful illumination computation method. As a further extension to this particle tracing work, in this paper, we propose a simple and efficient particle tracing method for interactive walk-through. Here we use the concept similar to importance introduced by Smits et al in <ref> [5] </ref>. This importance has already been shown to be a view-independent potential function [6]. In particle tracing, one is carrying out the solution of the potential equation. So the importance value is already available in some form or other during the normal particle tracing operation. <p> It is possible to incorporate this idea into the particle tracing framework by introducing a concept of illuminating capacity (I l ) of each light source l towards a region. This is similar to what one calls importance in importance driven radiosity <ref> [5] </ref>. This capacity is actually the potential of the light source towards illuminating the specified region. However, here we will not be very rigorous about its expression.

Reference-contexts: We have captured C's by carrying out an independent normal run such that at least 1000 particles are emitted from each light source. For approximation of radiosity functions we have chosen direction independent spatial basis functions for N .
