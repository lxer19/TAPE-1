Abstract: Resource-bounded measure as originated by Lutz is an extension of classical measure theory which provides a probabilistic means of describing the relative sizes of complexity classes. Lutz has proposed the hypothesis that NP does not have p-measure zero, meaning loosely that NP contains a non-negligible subset of exponential time. This hypothesis implies a strong separation of P from NP and is supported by a growing body of plausible consequences which are not known to follow from the weaker assertion P 6= NP. It is shown in this paper that relative to a random oracle, NP does not have p-measure zero. The proof exploits the following independence property of algorithmically random sequences: if A is an algorithmically random sequence and a subsequence A 0 is chosen by means of a bounded Kolmogorov-Loveland

Reference-contexts: The main result of this paper is that a strong form of Lutz's hypothesis holds relative to a random oracle, improving the previous result of Bennett and Gill <ref> [2] </ref> that P 6= NP relative to a random oracle. The meaning of "measure zero" is in terms of resource-bounded measure, an extension of classical measure or probability theory on f0; 1g 1 , due to Lutz [28]. <p> Our arguments actually apply not just to NP but to some smaller classes such as FewP coNP; see Section 6. It is difficult at this point to assess the exact meaning of a random oracle separation such as Bennett and Gill's <ref> [2] </ref> or the stronger result proved here. In [2], Bennett and Gill proposed the random oracle hypothesis, i.e., if a property holds relative to almost every oracle, then it must hold in unrelativized form. <p> Our arguments actually apply not just to NP but to some smaller classes such as FewP coNP; see Section 6. It is difficult at this point to assess the exact meaning of a random oracle separation such as Bennett and Gill's <ref> [2] </ref> or the stronger result proved here. In [2], Bennett and Gill proposed the random oracle hypothesis, i.e., if a property holds relative to almost every oracle, then it must hold in unrelativized form. <p> The view of the first author is that random oracle results are useful largely for the insight they give into the properties of algorithmically random sequences and into the nature of probabilistic computation. In any event the present paper is a nontrivial improvement of <ref> [2] </ref> and introduces techniques which may be useful in other contexts. In particular we exploit the inde pendence properties of sequences which are algorithmically random (in the sense of Martin-Lof, Levin, or Chaitin; see Section 3).

Reference-contexts: To see that L A 62 coNP A for every algorithmically random A, it is enough to note that C is a union of recursively closed sets (a 0 2 -class) and hence contains no algorithmically random sequences by the "effective zero-one law" of [18] or by Theorem 2 of <ref> [3] </ref>. It was observed by Longpre [24] that the proof of Theorem 5.1 shows that (FewP j E i ) 6= 0, since with probability one, the number of witnesses for L A [y] = 1 is less than n = js y j for all but finitely y.

Under certain additional hypotheses it holds for PSPACE (Watanabe and Tang [46]). If E 6= NE the CvKL conjecture holds for NP [ co-NP and if E 6= NE " co-NE it holds for NP (Selman [36]).

It is not known at this time whether, in general, Q fl and N are independent or even whether N is algorithmically random. The theorem below does answer the corresponding questions for bounded Kolmogorov-Loveland place selections, and will play a crucial role in the proof of our main result.

Reference-contexts: Martin-Lof [29] offers a rationale for believing that the definition captures every property of randomness that mathematicians are ever likely to require (see [42] for an alternative viewpoint). The following characterization of algorithmic randomness, due to Solovay, provides an effective form of the Borel-Cantelli lemma (see <ref> [12, p.188] </ref>), i.e., if fE i g is a sequence of events (subsets of f0; 1g 1 ) whose probabilities are summable, then with probability one only finitely many of the E i occur.

Reference-contexts: For S a set of strings, we abbreviate Pr (Ext (S)) by Pr (S); if S is disjoint , i.e., all strings in S are pairwise incompatible, then Pr (S) = oe2S Standard results of measure theory (see <ref> [13] </ref>) show that E is measurable (meaning that Pr (E) is defined) as long as E is a Borel set, i.e., built up from intervals by some finite iteration of countable union and complementation operations; however, for the most part we will be concerned with the measure of intervals and cylinders, <p> It is not difficult to show that if A is algorithmically random and Q fl is obtained by means of a Kolmogorov-Loveland place selection, then Q fl is algorithmically random also. (In effect this is a version of a classical result on the 8 impossibility of successful gambling strategies; see <ref> [13] </ref> or [10].)

There is one instance in the proof of Theorem 5.7 where we will need the slight extra generality of a density function as defined in [28], also called a supermartingale. <p> This is a consequence of the following lemma, which is a special case of a standard result known as Kolmogorov's inequality for martingales (see <ref> [13, p. 242] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: In this paper we are only concerned with showing that a given p i -martingale is unable to succeed on a particular language. The following lemma, due independently to Juedes and Lutz <ref> [16] </ref> and to Mayordomo [31], ensures that for our purposes it suffices to consider only exact p i -martingales.

Then there is an exact p i -martingale ~ d such that if d succeeds on A 2 f0; 1g 1 , then ~ d succeeds on A also. <p> Figure 1, adapted from [26], summarizes the known relationships among "non-smallness" conditions on NP.

Reference-contexts: Roughly, two sequences A 0 and A 1 are 3 independent if each is algorithmically random relative to the other. For example, it is shown in [42] and in <ref> [17] </ref> that if A is algorithmically random and A 0 , A 1 denote the even and odd bits of A, respectively, then A 0 and A 1 are independent in this sense.

Recently one of the authors [19] has shown that if the subsequence A 0 is chosen from A according to a bounded Kolmogorov-Loveland place selection, and A 1 denotes the nonselected bits, then A 0 and A 1 are independent. <p> A proof can be found in <ref> [17] </ref>, [38], or [39]. 6 Theorem 3.2 A sequence A 2 f0; 1g 1 is algorithmically random if and only if for every uniform sequence of r.e. sets fS i g such that P i Pr (S i ) &lt; 1, A is in only finitely many of the classes Ext <p> If A is algorithmically random relative to B and B is algorithmically random relative to A, then we say that A and B are independent . A fundamental result about independence is the following; see <ref> [17] </ref> or [41]. <p> The theorem below does answer the corresponding questions for bounded Kolmogorov-Loveland place selections, and will play a crucial role in the proof of our main result. The proof of Theorem 3.6 is based on techniques developed in [19] and in <ref> [17] </ref>, where a number of independence properties are established for subsequences of random sequences. Theorem 3.6 Let F , G, and H be partial recursive functions determining a bounded Kolmogorov-Loveland place selection, let A 2 f0; 1g 1 , and let N and Q fl be as in Definition 3.5.

Reference-contexts: Since it is known that the class P does have p-measure zero, the hypothesis p (NP) 6= 0 implies that P 6= NP. Lutz and Mayordomo cite evidence in <ref> [26] </ref> for the plausibility of the hypothesis p (NP) 6= 0. In particular, its negation would imply the the existence of a betting algorithm for efficiently predicting membership in NP languages, a consequence which turns out to be intuitively quite unlikely. <p> We discuss this in greater detail in Section 4 after giving the relevant definitions. The hypothesis p (NP) 6= 0 also has a number of plausible consequences which are not known to follow from the weaker assertion P 6= NP. In particular in <ref> [26] </ref> Lutz and Mayordomo prove that if p (NP) 6= 0, then the "Cook versus Karp-Levin" (CvKL) conjecture holds for NP, that is, there is a language which is P T -complete but not P m -complete for NP.

Under certain additional hypotheses it holds for PSPACE (Watanabe and Tang [46]). <p> This fact and the plausibility of the CvKL conjecture itself suggest that a stronger class separation such as p (NP) 6= 0 is likely to be true. Other consequences of the hypothesis p (NP) 6= 0 cited in <ref> [26] </ref> include the following (here EE denotes the doubly-exponential class S 1 c=0 DTIME (2 2 n+c ) and NEE denotes the corresponding nondeterministic class): 1. E 6= NE and EE 6= NEE (Mayordomo [30], Lutz and Mayordomo [26]). 2. <p> Other consequences of the hypothesis p (NP) 6= 0 cited in <ref> [26] </ref> include the following (here EE denotes the doubly-exponential class S 1 c=0 DTIME (2 2 n+c ) and NEE denotes the corresponding nondeterministic class): 1. E 6= NE and EE 6= NEE (Mayordomo [30], Lutz and Mayordomo [26]). 2. There exist NP search problems which are not reducible to the corresponding decision problems (this follows from item 1 above and a result of Bellare and Goldwasser [1]). 3. Every P m -complete language for NP contains a dense exponential complexity core (Juedes and Lutz [11]). 4. <p> It is also not difficult to show that (E i j E i ) 6= 0 and that (P j E i ) = 0. We are interested in the size of NP in the classes E and E 2 . Figure 1, adapted from <ref> [26] </ref>, summarizes the known relationships among "non-smallness" conditions on NP. <p> In Section 1 we discussed some of the consequences of the hypothesis p (NP) 6= 0; we conclude this section with a brief intuitive argument, originally given in <ref> [26] </ref>, for the intrinsic plausibility of the hypothesis. The condition p (NP) = 0 would imply that there exists a single p-martingale d which succeeds on every language A 2 NP.

Our main result is that relative to a random oracle, NP does not have measure zero in E, meaning that NP"E does not have p-measure zero.

Reference-contexts: The meaning of "measure zero" is in terms of resource-bounded measure, an extension of classical measure or probability theory on f0; 1g 1 , due to Lutz <ref> [28] </ref>. The aspects of resource-bounded measure needed for the present results are introduced in Section 4. <p> We avoid using the notation joej unless oe 2 f0; 1g fl , however following <ref> [28] </ref> we let jjoejj denote the number of defined bits in oe. <p> If A is algorithmically random and N is infinite, then N is algorithmically random relative to Q fl ; thus by Theorem 3.4, N and Q fl are independent. 4 Resource-bounded measure Resource-bounded measure theory, as formulated by Lutz <ref> [28] </ref>, is a form of effective measure theory which provides a means of describing the measure or probability of sets of languages within complexity classes and of defining the random languages (i.e., the pseudorandom sequences) within a complexity class. <p> The formulation of Lutz is extremely general|for example, classical Lebesgue measure on f0; 1g 1 is a special case|and is presented in <ref> [28] </ref> in terms of the powerful notion of n-dimensional density systems, but its origins may be traced back to the work of Schnorr on computable martingales [35]. <p> Our presentation here is highly abbreviated, covering just those aspects needed for the proofs at hand, that is, to describe measure in the classes E and E 2 , and we use the simpler language of martingales rather than density systems. The reader is encouraged to consult [31] or <ref> [28] </ref> for a more complete development of resource-bounded measure; see [13] or [47] for general background on martingales.

There is one instance in the proof of Theorem 5.7 where we will need the slight extra generality of a density function as defined in [28], also called a supermartingale. Definition 4.1 A density function is a function d : f0; 1g fl ! [0; 1) such that for all oe 2 f0; 1g fl , 1 d (oe0) + 2 If (3) holds with equality then d is a martingale. <p> If (X j E i ) = 0, we say that X is a negligibly small part of E i ; if (X j E i ) = 1, then almost every language A 2 E i is in X. Lutz <ref> [28] </ref> has proved a number of results justifying the use of this terminology, e.g., the measure zero sets in E i behave set-theoretically like "small" sets and the measure one sets behave set-theoretically like "large" sets.

There is one instance in the proof of Theorem 5.7 where we will need the slight extra generality of a density function as defined in [28], also called a supermartingale. <p> In this paper we are only concerned with showing that a given p i -martingale is unable to succeed on a particular language. The following lemma, due independently to Juedes and Lutz [16] and to Mayordomo <ref> [31] </ref>, ensures that for our purposes it suffices to consider only exact p i -martingales. (See [16] for a somewhat stronger version.) 10 Lemma 4.5 Let d be a p i -martingale. <p> only a finite number of bits is also in X|then there are only three possibilities for the p i -measure of X: p i (X) = 0, p i (X) = 1, or X is not p i -measurable. (This is the resource-bounded form of the Kolmogorov zero-one law; see <ref> [31, p. 37] </ref> for a proof.) Note that Definition 4.4 may easily be relativized to an oracle A 2 f0; 1g 1 , in which case we may write A p i instead of p i in Definition 4.6.

Reference-contexts: 2 -measure zero" relative to a random oracle. (Here p and p 2 refer to the appropriate resource bounds for measure in E and in E 2 , respectively; see Section 4 for definitions.) A further consequence is that, by virtue of a recent result by Regan, Sivakumar, and Cai <ref> [33] </ref>, NP is not measurable in E or E 2 relative to a random oracle (see Section 6). Our arguments actually apply not just to NP but to some smaller classes such as FewP coNP; see Section 6. <p> Regan, Sivakumar and Cai <ref> [33] </ref> have recently shown that if C is any class closed under finite unions and intersections such that E i C is nonempty, then C cannot have measure one in E i .

Reference-contexts: Second, the explicitness of the definition of R may actually make (2) easier to prove than (1).

Here we will simply take as R the class of algorithmically random sequences defined below. The definition we present is due to Martin-Lof [29]. <p> We are interested, however, in subsequences which depend on the sequence A itself. The definition below describes a very general selection process which encompasses several special cases of interest. The process may be pictured as follows, as suggested in <ref> [40] </ref>: Suppose the sequence A is represented as a row of cards laid face down; on the face of the ith card is either a zero or a one, corresponding to A [i]. <p> The value of G is either 0 or 1; if the value is 0, the card is merely turned over and observed, while if the value is 1 the card is also selected , i.e., added onto the end of the subsequence. 7 Definition 3.5 A Kolmogorov-Loveland place selection <ref> [40] </ref> is a pair of partial re-cursive functions F : f0; 1g fl ! IN and G : f0; 1g fl ! f0; 1g.

Reference-contexts: The proof of our main result rests heavily on the notion of relative randomness. We say that A is random relative to B, or A is independent of B, to mean in a strong sense that B "has no information about A" <ref> [41] </ref>. That is, not only is it the case that A cannot be computed from B, but access to B provides no help in guessing or approximating initial segments of A. In [41] van Lambalgen proposes an axiomatization of independence relations appropriate for characterizing randomness, and there it is shown that <p> A is independent of B, to mean in a strong sense that B "has no information about A" <ref> [41] </ref>. That is, not only is it the case that A cannot be computed from B, but access to B provides no help in guessing or approximating initial segments of A. In [41] van Lambalgen proposes an axiomatization of independence relations appropriate for characterizing randomness, and there it is shown that relative randomness as defined below satisfies the independence axioms. Definition 3.3 Let B 2 f0; 1g 1 . <p> If A is algorithmically random relative to B and B is algorithmically random relative to A, then we say that A and B are independent . A fundamental result about independence is the following; see [17] or <ref> [41] </ref>.
