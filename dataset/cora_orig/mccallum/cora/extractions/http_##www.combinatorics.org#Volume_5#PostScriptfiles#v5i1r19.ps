Abstract: Submitted: March 3, 1998; Accepted: March 25, 1998 Abstract: We prove the statement of the title, thereby solving a $100 problem of Ron Graham. [ x i x j x i+j + (1 x i )(1 x j )(1 x i+j ) ] ; over the n-dimensional (discrete) unit cube f(x 1 ; : : : ; x n )jx i = 0; 1g. We will determine all local If (z 1 ; : : : ; z n ) is a local minimum of F , then we have the n inequalities: Since we are only interested in the asymptotic behavior, we can modify F by any amount that is O(n). In particular, we can replace F (x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) by G(x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) = F (x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) + i=1 1
