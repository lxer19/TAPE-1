Abstract: At Eurocrypt 1993, Park, Itoh, and Kurosawa presented an all/nothing election scheme and anonymous channel. The schemes are based on the mix-net and the election scheme constructed from this anonymous channel (Chaum 1981). One of the two main improvements is that the messages sent by normal participants are significantly shorter in the two new anonymous channels. However, we show several successful attacks on these channels and thus on the secrecy of the votes in the election scheme. They break the first, more efficient channel completely. For the second channel and the election protocol, we present some countermeasures against all our attacks. Note, however, that we do not guarantee security even then, and that the specification of that channel is somewhat weaker than that of the original mix-net.

Reference-contexts: The easiest way is to use p = 2q + 1 and the factor group F q := ZZ p / -1, 1-. It is represented by the numbers -1, , (p 1)/2- (as noted for a similar purpose in <ref> [4] </ref>). Now g has to be a generator of the group of prime order, i.e., F q , and random exponents are from the interval -0, , q 1-. The rest of the protocol can be described as before.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The article <ref> [8] </ref> proposes two cryptographic protocols to realize an anonymous channel and one protocol for multiparty elections based on them. The structure of these protocols is adapted from the mix-net and the corresponding election scheme [3]. <p> However, the participants should not learn which of these messages originated from which of the other participants. Thus the message contents become known, but the senders of the messages are anonymous, or, in other one words, untraceable. Anonymous channels can be considered in different fault scenarios. In <ref> [8] </ref>, the scenario is as follows: There are k distinguished participants, the shuffle machine agents. We use Chaums original and shorter word mix instead. Anonymity should be guaranteed as long as at least one mix is honest. <p> This is the same scenario as for the original mix-net, except that the latter does not require reliable broadcast [3]. 1 Both protocols in <ref> [8] </ref> and the original mix-net are of the following structure: First, each participant sends an encrypted form of its secret message to the public board or the first mix, respectively. The rest of the protocol is just between the mixes. <p> The rest of the protocol is just between the mixes. With the original mix-net, the size of this first ciphertext is proportional to the number k of mixes used. (Recall that increasing k increases the security.) In <ref> [8] </ref>, this ciphertext is always just two ElGamal blocks long. Taking special care about the length of this first ciphertext is reasonable, since normal participants may have to rely on normal communication infrastructure, whereas mixes may have special broadband connections. 2 The difference between the two channels in [8] is that <p> security.) In <ref> [8] </ref>, this ciphertext is always just two ElGamal blocks long. Taking special care about the length of this first ciphertext is reasonable, since normal participants may have to rely on normal communication infrastructure, whereas mixes may have special broadband connections. 2 The difference between the two channels in [8] is that the first one is completely noninteractive between the mixes, i.e., each message is passed through each mix exactly once. <p> This protocol does not even make use of reliable broadcast between the mixes. 1 . 2 Overview of the Attacks We found two types of attacks on the anonymous channels in <ref> [8] </ref>. The first one is a simple passive attack that is successful against both protocols. Passive means that the attacker only observes the participants. However, this attack can be countered with a small change to the protocols. Secondly, there is an active attack, i.e., the attacker deviates from his protocol. <p> With the second channel, the attack can be countered; however, one really seems to need reliable broadcast for this purpose. Historically, active attacks on mix-nets were first considered in [9]; in particular, the direct implementation of the mix-net as described in <ref> [8] </ref> with RSA as the cryptosystem was broken there. However, countermeasures were also proposed in [9], so that the mix-net as such can be considered secure. Such attacks are also mentioned in [10]. 2 The Proposed Anonymous Channels The two protocols for anonymous channels in [8] are called Type 1 channel <p> the mix-net as described in <ref> [8] </ref> with RSA as the cryptosystem was broken there. However, countermeasures were also proposed in [9], so that the mix-net as such can be considered secure. Such attacks are also mentioned in [10]. 2 The Proposed Anonymous Channels The two protocols for anonymous channels in [8] are called Type 1 channel and Type 2 channel. The former is more efficient, the latter more suitable for the election protocol. <p> original mix-net, after the countermeasures that we introduce to retain any security, is that it becomes possible for any participant to disrupt the protocol, not just for any mix. 2 However, normal participants usually do not have physical broadcast channels, and a cryptographic solution would destroy the efficiency intended in <ref> [8] </ref> (since each participant would have to send at least one separate message to each mix). Hence the whole approach makes more sense if one does not use the public board for these first ciphertexts. <p> Before going into details of the real attack, note that a very simple form of this attack was generally countered in the original protocols in [3], but no longer in <ref> [8] </ref>: the mixes never process the same input twice. In [8], it is obvious that at least the last mix would need the same measure: If it gets the same input twice, it also gives the same output twice, and hence one can see which output corresponds to this input. 6 <p> Before going into details of the real attack, note that a very simple form of this attack was generally countered in the original protocols in [3], but no longer in <ref> [8] </ref>: the mixes never process the same input twice. In [8], it is obvious that at least the last mix would need the same measure: If it gets the same input twice, it also gives the same output twice, and hence one can see which output corresponds to this input. 6 4 . 1 Basic Form For the real attack, assume <p> Hence there must be redundancy in the result any M i obtains after its operation. With all known scheme, this makes the total length of the ciphertext proportional to the number of mixes again, which <ref> [8] </ref> tried to avoid. 4 . 4 Attack on Several Honest Mixes The attack can be extended to any number of honest mixes. <p> However, if the channel were to be used in practice, one would at least have to reconsider identification of disrupters (with broadcast or additional signatures in the messages) and then to compare the efficiency again. 6 Outlook We have shown several attacks on the anonymous channels from <ref> [8] </ref> and countermeasures for those on the socalled Type 2 channel. We do not guarantee that the channel or the corresponding election protocol is secure after these modifications. <p> Generally, one can only plead that at least as much care is taken with respect to partial information and active attacks with large protocols as with cryptosystems and signature schemes. Even with schemes like those in <ref> [8] </ref> where one cannot expect to be able to prove that they are as hard as, say, computing discrete logarithms (because of the exploitation of multiplicativity), an outline of a security analysis would be helpful. 9 Acknowledgements It is a pleasure to thank Josh Benaloh and David Chaum for an interesting
