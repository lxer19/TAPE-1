Reference-contexts: Conversely, they are possible in cases of semantically odd coreference in which SE reflexives are not, as in Jackendoff's 1992 "Mme. Tussaud's" cases, like Ringo fell on HIMSELF (i.e. "on his statue") versus Italian * Ringo SI cadde addosso . <ref> (See Burzio 1994a) </ref>. 6. Interacting Hierarchies The above discussion has argued for the existence of four different hierarchies at work. One of these, the one in (1), due to the principle of Referential Economy, will have an "avoid pronoun" effect (we put the Avoid Rexpression effect aside, here).

Reference-contexts: Similarly for the rest of the scale, which is instantiated by: Russian, allowing LD anaphora at most out infinitives; Danish, allowing it at most out of small clauses; and Dutch, allowing it only out of NPs <ref> (see Burzio 1996 and reff. for finer-grained distinctions) </ref>. In contrast to the subjects of (13), object s never block anaphoric relations, and can therefore be added as the rightmost point on the scale. <p> We pu t aside here the "NIC" effect on reflexives, that is the fact that they (both SE and SELF types) are excluded as subjects of tensed clause s <ref> (see Burzio 1996) </ref>. We will return to the lack of "subject orientation" of SELF reflexives below. In sum, the interpretation of reflexives involves identifying an "optimal" antecedent, a task achievable by an appropriate system of soft constraints - arguably, the one in (17a, b), (18).

Reference-contexts: given in (19) directly in the constraint version relevant for the discussion that follows. (19) * full-INTENS &gt;&gt; * full &gt;&gt; * clitic &gt;&gt; * 1 The ranked constraints in (19) can be taken to reflect a principle of economy of structure not unlike the one driving (1a, b, c) <ref> (and similar to one proposed i n Cardinaletti and Starke 1994) </ref>, but specifically referring to morphologica l structure. Since the more costly options in (19) are sometimes used, there must be some other principle at work to impose them. We take that principle to b e some form of "recoverability".

Reference-contexts: The parallelism is highlighted further by the fact that the exceptions to this basi c generalization are the same in both cases: experiencer objects are subject-lik e both for blocking and for antecedency <ref> (see in particular Huang and Tang 1991) </ref>. The differential behavior of antecedents is further observable in cases like (14) in Russian. 1 (14) a.

Reference-contexts: (12) above) appears to be both present and violated in Russian, given (24a, b, c). (24) a. ... vy razreite u vas / ?(?)sebja pereno g evat'? i i i you allow by you/ SE stay overnight "... will you allow (us) to stay overnight with you ?" i i <ref> (Timberlake 1979, 127, fn.8) </ref> b. <p> Starik ... prosil [ na kurort sebja / ego / i i i old man ask to resort SE/ him pokuda ne otpravljat'] now not send off "The old man asked not to send i him off to a health resort just now" i <ref> (Timberlake 1979, 124) </ref> c. ...ja mog navredit' sebe / *mne ... i i i I can harm SE / me i i i "...I can harm myself..." (Timberlake 1979, 113) That person-constraint rears its head in (24a), where it is apparently combining with an independent Avoid Reflexive effect from nonoptimal antecedency <p> ne otpravljat'] now not send off "The old man asked not to send i him off to a health resort just now" i (Timberlake 1979, 124) c. ...ja mog navredit' sebe / *mne ... i i i I can harm SE / me i i i "...I can harm myself..." <ref> (Timberlake 1979, 113) </ref> That person-constraint rears its head in (24a), where it is apparently combining with an independent Avoid Reflexive effect from nonoptimal antecedency t o overcome Avoid Pronoun, the two independent effects being otherwise only in a tie as in (24b). <p> John saw himself (SELF) i i b. French (Zribi-Hertz 1980: 137) Victor n'aime que lui (pronoun) i i Victor only loves him "Victor only loves himself " i i c. Italian Io mi vedo (pronoun) i i "I see myself " i i d. Russian <ref> (Timberlake 1979, 113) </ref> ...ja mog navredit' sebe / *mne ... (SE) i i i I can harm SE / me i i i "...I can harm myself..." All of these cases follow from our approach, and were in fact discussed above : (2a), (5b, c), (24b).
