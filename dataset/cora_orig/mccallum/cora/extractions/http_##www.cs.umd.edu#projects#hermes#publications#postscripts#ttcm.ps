Abstract: We develop a theory of media objects, and present optimal algorithms for collaborative object synthesis for constructing multimedia documents by composing together a given set of media objects. We then extend the algorithms to incorporate quality constraints (such as image size) as well as distribution across multiple nodes. The theoretical model is validated by an experimental implementation that supports the theoretical results.

[8] have built an experimental collaborative environment called Medusa. Rajan, Vin et al. <ref> [9] </ref> started some work on formalizing the notion of multimedia collaboration. 6 Conclusions We have classified media objects into four broad categories: static, quasi-static, temporal, and quasi-temporal, and developed a theory of media objects in which each media object is represented as a 5-tuple.
