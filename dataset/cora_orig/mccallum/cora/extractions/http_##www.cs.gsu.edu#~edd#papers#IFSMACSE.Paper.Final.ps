Title: ON LEARNING FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF GROUP THEORY  Running head: Learning concepts of group theory

Abstract: The research reported in this paper explores the nature of student knowledge about group theory, and how an individual may develop an understanding of certain topics in this domain. As part of a long-term research and development project in learning and teaching undergraduate mathematics, this report is one of a series of papers on the abstract algebra component of that project. The observations discussed here were collected during a six-week summer workshop where 24 high school teachers took a course in Abstract Algebra as part of their work. By comparing written samples, and student interviews with our own theoretical analysis, we attempt to describe ways in which these individuals seemed to be approaching the concepts of group, subgroup, coset, normality, and quotient group. The general pattern of learning that we infer here illustrates an action-process-object-schema framework for addressing these specific group theory issues. We make here only some quite general observations about learning these specific topics, the complex nature of "understanding", and the role of errors and misconceptions in light of an action-process-object-schema framework. Seen as research questions for further exploration, we expect these observations to inform our continuing investigations and those of other researchers. We end the paper with a brief discussion of some pedagogical suggestions arising out of our considerations. We defer, however, a full consideration of instructional strategies and their effects on learning these topics to some future time when more extensive research can provide a more solid foundation for the design of specific pedagogies.

Reference-contexts: Students always have difficulty accepting the idea that the boolean value of P =) Q is true when P and Q are both false. Our experience in using computers in Discrete Mathematics <ref> (Baxter et al, 1988) </ref> is that when such an expression is entered in the computer and it returns the value true, the student is more likely to go through a learning disequilibration/reequilibration cycle than when such an assertion is presented in class.

Reference-contexts: Then, in subsequent years, the topics should be revisited and considered repeatedly at successively higher levels of sophistication <ref> (Bruner, 1964) </ref>. This philosophy was one of the driving principles of the "new math" curriculum. We believe very strongly that an alternative to linear sequencing must be found. Many students do come to abstract algebra courses without strong conceptions of functions and some are even ill-equipped to deal with sets.

Reference-contexts: As far as we know, none of these theoretical perspectives has been applied to abstract algebra. Our point of view is an attempt to extend the Piagetian concept of reflective abstraction to post-secondary mathematics <ref> (Dubinsky, 1991) </ref>. It is quite different from these perspectives but has many points in common with them, especially with Sfard's theory.

Reference-contexts: Thus we were looking at a population in the midst of an experience involving groups, but without a strong background in the subject. The course used written material and worksheets which later became a textbook <ref> (Dubinsky and Leron, 1993.) </ref> The order in which topics were considered was fairly standard. Some specifics will be given below in the section on Interpretations to indicate what relation the observed developments might have had to the order in which the participants studied the topics in the course.

Reference-contexts: objects, and to thematize collections of processes and objects into schemas? In many places, Piaget has emphasized that the major constructions in cognitive development cannot be accelerated by education (Piaget, 1972), but it is possible to enhance the experiential base of students to enrich the developments that do take place <ref> (Inhelder et al, 1974) </ref>. Sfard, 1992 has discussed the exceptional difficulty of getting students to construct objects out of processes and even suggests the possibility that what we are calling encapsulation may be beyond the ability of some students.

Reference-contexts: There are a number of theories of learning which have been applied to mathematics at the post-secondary level.

As far as we know, none of these theoretical perspectives has been applied to abstract algebra. Our point of view is an attempt to extend the Piagetian concept of reflective abstraction to post-secondary mathematics (Dubinsky, 1991).

Reference-contexts: to interiorize actions, to construct processes, to reverse processes, to coordinate processes, to construct other processes, to encapsulate processes, to construct objects, and to thematize collections of processes and objects into schemas?

Reference-contexts: The questions we are asking, the methodology we use in asking them, and our interpretations of the students' responses are all driven by a constructivist approach, based on the ideas of Piaget <ref> (see, for example, Piaget, 1975) </ref> which we are trying to adapt to studies of advanced mathematical thinking. We bring to this work a committment to the integration of theory, practice, and pedagogy which reflects the suggestions of educational researchers such as Erickson (1986) and Glaser (1968).

Reference-contexts: Several learning theories incorporate interpretations of errors. For example, the notion of epistemological obstacles introduced by Bachelard, 1938 <ref> (see 26 also Sierpinska, 1992) </ref> suggests that these errors may represent stages through which a learner must pass, and that rather than eliminate them, we can only help a student avoid getting stuck.

Reference-contexts: Again, we suggest team work and computer activities. Students seem to be more likely to think seriously about (rather than just accept) contradictions presented by their peers than those presented by their teachers <ref> (Vidakovic, 1993) </ref>. As for the computer, it appears to have much more power to shake up a students' thought processes than does any human. Regarding the latter, we can offer one piece of anecdotal evidence from a course in elementary discrete mathematics.

Reference-contexts: This continues with isomorphism, normality, quotient group, and so on. One alternative that has been suggested is called learning by successive refinement, a method common in software development <ref> (Wirth, 1971) </ref>. In this approach, the student is always dealing with the whole except that he or she goes through a sequence of simplified versions of it, each one a bit more complex and more like the final version than the previous one.
