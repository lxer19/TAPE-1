Abstract: We show how a special decomposition of general projection matrices, called canonic enables us to build geometric descriptions for a system of cameras which are invariant with respect to a given group of transformations. These representations are minimal and capture completely the properties of each level of description considered: Euclidean (in the context of calibration, and in the context of structure from motion, which we distinguish clearly), affine, and projective, that we also relate to each other. In the last case, a new decomposition of the well-known fundamental matrix is obtained. Dependencies, which appear when three or more views are available, are studied in the context of the canonic decomposition, and new composition formulas are established, as well as the link between local (ie for pairs of views) representations and global

Reference-contexts: The Similarity Group A transformation of P 3 leaves the absolute conic of 1 (X 2 2 +X 2 3 = 0) invariant if, and only if it is a similarity, which is a rigid displacement multiplied by a scale factor <ref> [4, 2] </ref>. The knowledge of the conic !, image of by the camera, is equivalent to that of the intrinsic parameters. This conic determines the angle between optical rays, which is coherent with the fact that the similarities conserve angles.

Reference-contexts: is also defined by the same parameters as the epipole, we see that the knowledge of the linear projection (5 parameters) and the epipole (2 parameters) completely define the 3 fi 3 matrices S and F, which is consistent with the result that the fundamental matrix depends on 7 parameters <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> It can also be used for self-calibration. The five constraints (15) on the intrinsic parameters are linear, whereas from the projective invariants, only two quadratic constraints were obtained <ref> [9, 3] </ref>. These last constraints are in fact implied by the former ones. 5 Conclusion This paper lays the ground for further studies about problems involving 3D information, multiple viewpoints, and uncalibrated cameras. It confirms the interest of the affine representation, which turns out to yield simple and powerful descriptions.

Reference-contexts: the direction of translation can be determined), in the calibration, or reconstruction paradigm, the scale factor is known, and the relevant group is the group of displacements (a rotation followed by a translation). 2.3 A New Representation for Projective Structure Factorizations of the Fundamental Matrix It has been shown in <ref> [6] </ref> that the matrix H which relates the two images of a plane, is linked to the fundamental matrix by the following system of equations: H F + F H = 0 (5) which is equivalent to the condition (compatibility of F and H): F = [e 0 ] fi H

Reference-contexts: the scalar have to be scaled accordingly, resulting in the quantities: r 1N = H e N L N = P e N -N = p e N (10) 3 A Canonic Representation for Multiple Views Whereas the composition relations in the displacement-invariant case are straightforward, in the similarity-invariant case <ref> [7] </ref> (resp. homography-invariant one [13]), it has been found that 11 (resp. 18) parameters are needed to represent the relations between three cameras. This is more than 2 fi 5 (resp. 2 fi 7), but less than 3 fi 5 (resp. 3 fi 7).

Reference-contexts: The principal aim of this paper is to describe such a framework, the canonic decomposition. The proofs and explicit formulas which could not be included because of lack of space can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. In this section, some descriptions of the cameras are presented. Section 2 gives the local canonic decomposition for two views. A global representation for the case of three and more views in Section 3. <p> The additional parameters can be determined from the knowledge of the three descriptions 1-2, 2-3, and 1-3. It means that knowing all the triples of descriptions for two views is equivalent to a description for three views. There are some subtleties with scale factors, discussed in <ref> [8] </ref>. From the count of parameters, it is seen that the triple of descriptions for two views is not a minimal representation.

Reference-contexts: The idea that several classical vision tasks could be performed without full calibration of the cameras, but only using some geometric information which can be obtained from mere point correspondences between uncalibrated images, has generated during the last few years an active research area, whose framework has been projective geometry <ref> [10] </ref>. More recently, affine geometry has been found to provide an interesting framework borrowing some nice characteristics from both Euclidean geometry and projective geometry. However, one can remark that the representations adopted in the literature are of very disparate nature, and that often they are not even minimal. <p> This is in opposition with another class of simplified models ranging from orthographic, weak perspective, to the affine camera <ref> [10, 11] </ref>. The goal of this paper is to exploit equation (1) to its fullest extend by deriving algebraic consequences (with geometric interpretations) of this equation in the case where several viewpoints are available.
