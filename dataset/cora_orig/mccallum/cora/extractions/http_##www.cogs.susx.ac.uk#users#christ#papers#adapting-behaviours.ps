Title: Adaptation of Obstacle-Avoidance in the face of Emerging Environmental Dynamics

Abstract: The avoidance of static obstacles is relatively easy to implement as an animat behaviour, even where the animat receives realistic `sensory' input from the environment (e.g., simulated, infra-red proximity signals). [1,2,3] The behaviour can also be learned by a variety of methods. However, natural implementations of static-obstacle avoidance may break down if the objects in the environment have dynamic properties. Any introduction of object motion directly affects the environmental cues which anticipate impending collisions. The paper shows that this happens in a systematic way. The statistical order of the sensory collision cues increases roughly in proportion with the level of obstacle mobility. Thus, adaptation of obstacle-avoidance behaviours (in animats) involves making a transition from strategies based on low-order cues to strategies based on high-order cues.

Reference-contexts: What it will do is show that any successful adaptation strategy for static-obstacle avoidance must have certain properties. In particular the adaptation strategy must enable the controller to test environmental cues of increasing statistical order <ref> [4] </ref>. This is most easily demonstrated via an examination of the sensory inputs used by the obstacle-avoiding animat within the simulation. The rows of Table 1 show a sequence of 10 sensory-motor associations implemented by the animat controller during the simulation.

Reference-contexts: The observation is but a small step on the way to an effective decomposition of the general problem of adaptation to dyanamic effects. But it does provides us with a rule of thumb for evaluating potential adaptation models. For example, imagine that the simple recurrent neural network (SRN) <ref> [5] </ref> is put up as a candidate model for the adaptation-to-dynamics task.
