Title: AN UPPER BOUND ON THE APPROXIMATION POWER OF PRINCIPAL SHIFT-INVARIANT SPACES  
Author: Michael J. Johnson 
Date: December 23, 1994  
Abstract: An upper bound on the L p -approximation power (1 p 1) provided by principal shift-invariant spaces is derived with only very mild assumptions on the generator. It applies to both stationary and non-stationary ladders, and is shown to apply to spaces generated by (exponential) box splines, polyharmonic splines, multiquadrics, and Gauss kernel.
