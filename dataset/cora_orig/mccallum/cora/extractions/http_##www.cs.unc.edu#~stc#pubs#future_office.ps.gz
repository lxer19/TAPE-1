Abstract: We introduce ideas, proposed technologies, and initial results for To accomplish the simultaneous capture and display we envision an office of the future where the ceiling lights are replaced by computer controlled cameras and smart projectors that are used to capture dynamic image-based models with techniques, and to display high-resolution images on designated display surfaces. By doing both simultaneously on the designated display surfaces, one can dynamically adjust or autocalibrate for geometric, intensity, and resolution variations resulting from irregular or changing display surfaces, or overlapped projector images. Our current approach to dynamic image-based modeling is to use an optimized structured light scheme that can capture per-pixel d e p t h a n d r e e c t a n c e a t i n t e r a c t iv e r a t e s . O u r s y s t e m implementation is not yet imperceptible, but we can demonstrate the approach in the laboratory. Our approach to rendering on the designated (potentially irregular) display surfaces is to employ a two-pass projective texture scheme to generate images that when projected onto the surfaces appear correct to a moving head-tracked observer. We present here an initial implementation of the overal l v isio n, i n a n office- like se ttin g, an d preli mina ry demonstrations of our dynamic modeling and display techniques.
