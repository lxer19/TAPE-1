Abstract: Auctions provide an efficient distributed mechanism for solving problems such as task and resource allocation in multiagent systems. In the Vickrey auction|which has been widely advocated for automated auctions [ 22; 1; 3; 5; 24; 2; 8; 9; 20; 13 ] |the best bid wins the auction, but at the second best price. In certain settings this promotes truthful bidding and avoids counterspecula-tion. This paper analyses the circumstances when this protocol is appropriate, and explicates the desirable properties and lack thereof in varied settings. The first part of the paper discusses known deficiencies of the Vick-rey auction: bidder collusion, a lying auctioneer, promotion of lying in non-private-value auctions, lower revenue than alternative protocols, and the necessity to reveal sensitive information. The second part of the paper presents our results regarding new limitations of the protocol, which arise especially among computational agents. These include inefficient allocation and lying in sequential auctions of interrelated items, untruthful bidding when a risk averse agent has local uncertainty, and the need for counterspeculation to make deliberation control (or information gathering) decisions when an agent has local uncertainty. fl This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. IRI-9523419.

The dominant strategy in private value Vickrey auctions is to bid one's true valuation. <p> If an agent bids its valuation and wins the auction, it will know that its valuation was too high because the other agents bid less. Therefore winning the auction amounts to a monetary loss. Knowing this in advance, agents should bid less than their valuations <ref> [ 11; 12 ] </ref> . This is the best strategy in this type of Vickrey auctions also. <p> One would imagine that the first-price auctions give higher expected revenue to the auctioneer because in second-price auctions the auctioneer only gets the second price. This is not the case however, because in first-price auctions the bidders are motivated to lie by biasing their bids downward. The revenue-equivalence theorem <ref> [ 23; 11; 12 ] </ref> states that all four auction protocols produce the same expected revenue to the auctioneer in private value auctions where the values are independently distributed. <p> The next sections present our results regarding previously unvoiced limitations of the Vickrey auction. 7 Inefficient allocation and lying in interrelated auctions In addition to single-item auctions, Vickrey auctions have been widely studied in the allocation of multiple items of a homogeneous good <ref> [ 11 ] </ref> . However, the case of auctioning heterogeneous interrelated goods has received little attention. On the other hand this is the setting of many real world problems where computational agents are used [ 18; 17; 19; 16; 13 ] . <p> Up to date it has not been adequately addressed in computational multia-gent systems that use Vickrey auctions. In auctions by humans, this issue is sometimes addressed by allowing a bidder to pool all of the interrelated items under one entirety bid <ref> [ 11 ] </ref> . Another method for enhancing the efficiency of interrelated auctions is to allow agents to backtrack from commitments by paying penalties.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the agent can recontract out the task in which case the cost depends solely on other agents' valuations. Next, I discuss four different auction protocols <ref> [ 12 ] </ref> . In the English (first-price open-cry) auction, each bidder is free to raise his bid. When no bidder is willing to raise anymore, the auction ends, and the highest bidder wins the item at the price of his bid. <p> In general there is no dominant strategy for acting in this auction. With common knowledge assumptions regarding the probability distributions of the agents' values, it is possible to determine Nash equilibrium strategies for the agents <ref> [ 12 ] </ref> . In the Dutch (descending) auction, the seller continuously lowers the price until one of the bidders takes the item at the current price. <p> In the Vickrey (second-price sealed-bid) auction, each bidder submits one bid without knowing the others' bids. The highest bidder wins, but at the price of the second highest bid <ref> [ 23; 11; 12; 7; 4 ] </ref> . An agent's strategy is his bid as a function of his private value and prior beliefs of others' valuations. The dominant strategy in private value Vickrey auctions is to bid one's true valuation. <p> The English auction and the Vickrey auction actually self-enforce some of the most likely collusion agreements. Therefore, from the perspective of deterring collusion, the first-price sealed-bid and the Dutch auctions are preferable. The following example from <ref> [ 12 ] </ref> shows this. Let bidder Smith have value 20, and every other bidder have value 18 for the auctioned item. Say that the bidders collude by deciding that Smith will bid 6, and everyone else will bid 5. <p> If an agent bids its valuation and wins the auction, it will know that its valuation was too high because the other agents bid less. Therefore winning the auction amounts to a monetary loss. Knowing this in advance, agents should bid less than their valuations <ref> [ 11; 12 ] </ref> . This is the best strategy in this type of Vickrey auctions also. <p> One would imagine that the first-price auctions give higher expected revenue to the auctioneer because in second-price auctions the auctioneer only gets the second price. This is not the case however, because in first-price auctions the bidders are motivated to lie by biasing their bids downward. The revenue-equivalence theorem <ref> [ 23; 11; 12 ] </ref> states that all four auction protocols produce the same expected revenue to the auctioneer in private value auctions where the values are independently distributed.

On the other hand this is the setting of many real world problems where computational agents are used <ref> [ 18; 17; 19; 16; 13 ] </ref> . This section discusses cases where heterogeneous items are auctioned one at a time, and the agents' valuations of these items are not additive. This occurs for example in task allocation in transportation problems. <p> Such computational complexities arise for example in task allocation auctions where evaluating a task set requires solving NP-complete problems <ref> [ 18; 17; 19; 16; 13 ] </ref> . Risk neutral agents|i.e. agents with linear utility functions|are best off bidding the expected value of their valuation in a single-shot private value Vickrey auction. This is a dominant strategy. <p> Let us look at a situation where an agent has uncertainty regarding its own valuation of the auction item, but can pay to remove this uncertainty. This situation often occurs among computational agents, where the value of a good (or task contract <ref> [ 18; 17; 19; 16; 13 ] </ref> ) can only be determined via carrying out a costly computation|e.g. a solution of a combinatorial problem.

First-price auction protocols do not expose a bidder's valuation as clearly because the bid is subject to strategic lying. Therefore, these auction types may be more desirable than the Vickrey auction when valuations are sensitive.

It is important to understand these limitations in order not to ascribe desirable characteristics to a protocol when the protocol really does not guarantee them. <p> One would imagine that the first-price auctions give higher expected revenue to the auctioneer because in second-price auctions the auctioneer only gets the second price. This is not the case however, because in first-price auctions the bidders are motivated to lie by biasing their bids downward. The revenue-equivalence theorem <ref> [ 23; 11; 12 ] </ref> states that all four auction protocols produce the same expected revenue to the auctioneer in private value auctions where the values are independently distributed.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Auctions provide efficient, distributed and autonomy preserving ways of solving task and resource allocation problems in computational multiagent systems <ref> [ 16; 21; 5; 24; 2; 8 ] </ref> . Auctions can be used among cooperative agents, but they also work in open systems consisting of self-interested agents. <p> Vickrey auctions have been widely advocated and adopted for use in computational multiagent systems [ 22; 1; 3; 5; 24; 2; 8; 9; 20; 13 ] . For example, versions of the Vickrey auction have been used to allocate computation resources in operating systems <ref> [ 24; 2 ] </ref> , to allocate bandwidth in computer networks [ 22; 8; 9; 20 ] , and to computationally control building environments [ 5 ] .
