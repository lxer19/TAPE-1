Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We compute the large-n behavior of the expected maximum of a symmetric random walk S n = P 1kn Z k ; n 0; with the initial position S 0 := 0, and with steps Z k drawn independently and uniformly at random from the interval <ref> [1; +1] </ref>. Our result is applied to strip packings of rectangles and sharpens an expected-height estimate of Coffman and Shor [3] for rectangles with dimensions drawn independently and uniformly at random from [0; 1]. <p> Our result is applied to strip packings of rectangles and sharpens an expected-height estimate of Coffman and Shor [3] for rectangles with dimensions drawn independently and uniformly at random from <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. In broad outline, the analysis begins with an explicit formula for E max 0kn S k which involves an awkward combinatorial sum. <p> step 3 is H 1=2 +max 0y1=2 ffi (y), so the final height H after step 4 is bounded by 1 max ffi (y) + 2 For an average-case analysis, we adopt the uniform model in which the X i and Y i are 2n independent uniform random draws from <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Then we obtain EH 4 1 E max S k + 2 since as observed in [3], max 0y1=2 ffi (y) is equal in distribution to max 0kn S k . <p> Thus, w n (z) and w 1 (z) are analytic in the region D defined as the complex plane minus the slit <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. The functions w n (z) and w 1 (z) play a critical role in the proof of Theorem 1. In the next lemma, we collect various properties of these functions. <p> Asymptotics The leading term in E max 0kn S k is easy to find, since the functional central limit theorem [4, xXV.5] states that the process n ; t 0 converges in distribution to standard Brownian motion ( 2 = 1=3 is the variance of the uniform step distribution on <ref> [1; +1] </ref>). <p> (see e.g. [7, Ex. 3.2, p. 292]) n X k 1=2 = 2n 1=2 + (1=2) + n 1=2 =2 + O (n 3=2 ) (45) k=1 where (s) = P k1 k s ; &lt;(s) &gt; 1; is the Riemann zeta function, and where, by analytic continuation (see e.g. <ref> [1, formula (23.2.9)] </ref>), (1=2) = lim 1kn ! Substituting (45) and (46) into (44), we get E max S k = 2 n 1=2 c n + 5 2 n 1=2 + O (n 3=2 ); (47) where c n = (1=2) 6 (3=2) p + fi n : (48) Now <p> The rectangle packing problem is an extension of the square packing problem studied earlier in [2, x7.1.2], in which square sizes are determined by uniform random draws from <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. For squares, the Y i in (2) need to be changed to X i . The problem is again to find the expected maximum positive excursion of an n-step random walk starting at the origin, but the random walk is now biased and nonhomogeneous.

Reference-contexts: The rectangle packing problem is an extension of the square packing problem studied earlier in <ref> [2, x7.1.2] </ref>, in which square sizes are determined by uniform random draws from [0; 1]. For squares, the Y i in (2) need to be changed to X i . <p> It is known that the expected packing height is EH = 8 where the first term is EH 1=2 and the second term is the expected maximum of the random walk. However, the techniques in <ref> [2] </ref> shed no light on the hidden multiplicative constant (much less on lower-order terms).

Reference-contexts: As might be expected, the constant c can be computed to much greater accuracy than that given above. With Maple doing the computations, we demonstrated this, basing our numerical method on Romberg acceleration (see e.g. <ref> [5, x11.12] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: In broad outline, the analysis begins with an explicit formula for E max 0kn S k which involves an awkward combinatorial sum. The asymptotic analysis of this sum is approached via Rice's method <ref> [6, x6.3.1.2] </ref>, which in turn entails the asymptotics of the integral I n := 0 1 j=1 x 2 + j 2 dx: (1) Interesting in its own right, the analysis of I n is given in Section 2, where we prove the following large-n asymptotic behavior. <p> The distribution of the maximum of the random walk is given by the Pollaczek-Spitzer identity <ref> [6, x7.3.4.2] </ref>. For the first moment we have E max S k = k=1 k ]=k: (27) To evaluate ES + k using (26), the following combinatorial identities will be useful. <p> But to make an asymptotic analysis easier, we can convert (35) into an integral form using Rice's method <ref> [6, x6.3.1.2] </ref> as follows. Let ES + k+1 D k to allow neater expressions.

Reference-contexts: Now apply the Euler-Maclaurin formula to the last two sums in (44). Standard manipulations show that (see e.g. <ref> [7, Ex. 3.2, p. 292] </ref>) n X k 1=2 = 2n 1=2 + (1=2) + n 1=2 =2 + O (n 3=2 ) (45) k=1 where (s) = P k1 k s ; &lt;(s) &gt; 1; is the Riemann zeta function, and where, by analytic continuation (see e.g. [1, formula (23.2.9)]),
