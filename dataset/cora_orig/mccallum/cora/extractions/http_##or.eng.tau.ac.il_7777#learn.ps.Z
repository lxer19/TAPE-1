Abstract: Most research on the application of machine learning to engineering problems have solved artificial problems. While research claimed to have reached results that would improve practice, these results have never been put to work by engineers themselves in solving their problems. A different approach of doing research on machine learning application is presented and a system design that may result in tangible practical results is outlined. The development of this system is underway.

Reference-contexts: The decision procedure was a program for selecting among groundwater modeling techniques developed at Duke University (Medina et al 1988) and used by North Carolina and US Air Force officials.

Reference-contexts: Two potential types of frameworks are outlined. The first type allows users' interaction, but enforces a particular underlying representation for capturing knowledge, examples, and concepts. One example of this type is MLT <ref> (Morik et al 1991) </ref>. If such a framework provides an expressive language and mechanisms for translating information between the representations of different techniques (originally built for different representation languages), the framework could be used successfully to leverage on the strength of different programs.

The use of different programs' parameters created different representations (or perspectives) of the original procedure, thus facilitating its evaluation and subsequent redesign.
