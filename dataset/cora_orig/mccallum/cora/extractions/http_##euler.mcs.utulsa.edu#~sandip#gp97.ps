Abstract: Cooperative co-evolutionary systems can facilitate the development of teams of heterogeneous agents. We believe that k different behavioral strategies for controlling the actions of a group of k agents can combine to form a cooperation strategy which efficiently achieves global goals. We examine the on-line adaption of behavioral strategies utilizing genetic programming. Specifically, we deal with the credit assignment problem of how to fairly split the fitness of a team to all of its participants. We present several crossover mechanisms in a genetic programming system to facilitate the evolution of more than one member in the team during each crossover operation. Our goal is to reduce the time needed to evolve a good team.
