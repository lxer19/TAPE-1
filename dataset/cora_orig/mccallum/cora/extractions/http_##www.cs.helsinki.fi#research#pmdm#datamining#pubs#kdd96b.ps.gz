Abstract: Sequences of events are an important special form of data that arises in several contexts, including telecommunications, user interface studies, and epidemiology. We present a general and flexible framework of specifying classes of generalized episodes. These are recurrent combinations of events satisfying certain conditions. The framework can be instantiated to a wide variety of applications by selecting suitable primitive conditions. We present algorithms for discovering frequently occurring episodes and episode rules. The algorithms are based on the use of minimal occurrences of episodes; this makes it possible to evaluate confidences of a wide variety of rules using only a single analysis pass. We present empirical results on the behavior of the algorithms on events stemming from a WWW log.

Reference-contexts: We omit the details. A problem similar to the computation of frequencies occurs in the area of active databases. There triggers can be specified as composite events, somewhat similar to episodes. In <ref> (Gehani, Jagadish, & Shmueli 1992) </ref> it is shown how finite automata can be constructed from composite events to recognize when a trigger should be fired. This method is not practical for episodes since the deterministic automata could be very large.

Reference-contexts: In a telecommunication application, the rules found using the methods of (Mannila, Toivonen, & Verkamo 1995) have proven to be useful and they have been integrated in alarm handling software <ref> (Hatonen et al. 1996) </ref>. However, application studies both in the telecommunications domain and elsewhere have shown that there is a need for extensions to the methods. In this paper we study what types of episodes can be efficiently discovered from long sequences of events.

Reference-contexts: Recently, interest in knowledge discovery from sequences of events has increased: see, e.g., (Dousson, Ga-borit, & Ghallab 1993; Laird 1993; Wang et al. 1994; Morris, Khatib, & Ligozat 1995; Bettini, Wang, & Ja-jodia 1996). In a previous paper <ref> (Mannila, Toivonen, & Verkamo 1995) </ref> we showed how sequences of events can be analyzed by locating frequently occurring episodes from them. <p> An episode is a combination of events with a partially specified order; it occurs in a sequence, if there are occurrences of the events in an order consistent with the given order, within a given time bound. In a telecommunication application, the rules found using the methods of <ref> (Mannila, Toivonen, & Verkamo 1995) </ref> have proven to be useful and they have been integrated in alarm handling software (Hatonen et al. 1996). However, application studies both in the telecommunications domain and elsewhere have shown that there is a need for extensions to the methods. <p> Specification of, e.g., this condition was not possible in the framework of <ref> (Mannila, Toivonen, & Verkamo 1995) </ref>. <p> Differences to the previous model The episodes described in <ref> (Mannila, Toivonen, & Verkamo 1995) </ref> were based on conditions on the event types. That is, of our examples only the first episode of Example 1 would be representable within that framework. <p> The work most closely related to ours is perhaps (Srikant & Agrawal 1996). They search in multiple sequences for patterns that are similar to the serial episodes of <ref> (Mannila, Toivonen, & Verkamo 1995) </ref> with some extra restrictions and an event taxonomy. Our methods can be extended with a taxonomy by a direct application of the similar extensions to association rules. <p> Experiments with the data set of <ref> (Mannila, Toivonen, & Verkamo 1995) </ref> show that | with comparable parameters | the present method is as fast or faster than the one presented in (Mannila, Toivonen, & Verkamo 1995). <p> Experiments with the data set of <ref> (Mannila, Toivonen, & Verkamo 1995) </ref> show that | with comparable parameters | the present method is as fast or faster than the one presented in (Mannila, Toivonen, & Verkamo 1995). The new method has, however, two important advantages: the rule formalism is more useful, and rules with several different time bounds can be found with the same effort.

Reference-contexts: There are also some interesting similarities between the discovery of frequent episodes and the work done on inductive logic programming (see, e.g., <ref> (Muggleton 1992) </ref>); a noticeable difference is caused by the sequen-tiality of the underlying data model, and the emphasis on time-limited occurrences. Similarly, the problem of looking for one occurrence of an episode can be viewed as a constraint satisfaction problem.

Reference-contexts: The recent work on sequence data in databases (see <ref> (Seshadri, Livny, & Ramakrishnan 1996) </ref>) provides interesting openings towards the use of database techniques in the processing of queries on sequences.

Reference-contexts: There are also some smaller technical differences, e.g., the exact definition of the confidence of a rule is somewhat changed (and is now more natural, it seems to us). The work most closely related to ours is perhaps <ref> (Srikant & Agrawal 1996) </ref>. They search in multiple sequences for patterns that are similar to the serial episodes of (Mannila, Toivonen, & Verkamo 1995) with some extra restrictions and an event taxonomy.
