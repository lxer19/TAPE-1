Abstract: This paper describes architecture and circuit approaches for the design of highspeed, low-power, pipelined analog-to-digital converters in CMOS. The role of pipeline architectures in high-speed conversion is first discussed. Then a number of design issues related to power optimization in pipeline A/D converters are discussed, including power minimization in switched capacitor gain blocks operated on low supply voltages, implementation of transmission gates on low voltages, and capacitor scaling in pipelines. The application of these approaches is illustrated using results from an experimental 10-bit 20-MS/s pipeline A/D converter implemented in 1.2-mm CMOS technology that achieves a power dissipation of 35 mW at full speed operation.

Reference-contexts: One extra bit resolved in the f lash A/D block allows the comparator of fset to be within -Vref / 2 B+1 as in [1][2]. In the experimental prototype <ref> [3] </ref>, the per-stage resolution (B+1) is chosen to be 2 bits, giving one bit of ef fective resolution after digital correction. The input signal to the first stage is sampled simultaneously by the switched capacitor amplifier and by the dynamic comparators of the ash A/D. <p> Optimization of the circuit design together with optimum choice of power supply voltage can achieve large reductions, and this will be discussed in the following sections. Aspects of these design tradeoff are discussed in more detail in the following sections. In each case, results from an experimental pipeline ADC <ref> [3] </ref> are shown for illustration. 3.1 Operation at Lowered Power Supply Voltage From a fundamental viewpoint, operation at reduced power supply volt ages is not advantageous from a power dissipation perspective for analog cir-cuits whose dynamic range is kT/C limited and whose power dissipation is dominated by CV 2 dynamic power

Reference-contexts: This configuration was utilized in the pipeline prototype ADC we use as an example in this paper. The circuit diagram of this amplifier is shown in Fig. 6. Voltage gain is also enhanced by the inclusion of series feedback gain-boost amplifiers <ref> [4] </ref> in the PMOS current sources. These amplif iers are capacitively coupled into the signal path using level shift capacitors C1 and C2 which are initialized by closing switches SW1 and SW2. The common-mode feedback is also capacitive through C3 and C4. Fig. 6 Op amp with gain-boost amplifier.

Reference-contexts: This approach will become progressively more dif ficult at lower and lower supply voltages, but at 3.3 volts using a 5-volt-capable technology it is a relatively straightforward solution.

Reference-contexts: At resolutions in the 8-12 bit range, the only practical options for low power dissipation are multistep flash and pipeline configurations. Multistep flash implementations have been used very successfully in low-power applications at the 10-bit level <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> In Fig. 11, measured SNDR is plotted for 100 kHz and 10 MHz input fre quencies at 20-MS/s conversion rate. The peak SNDR is 59.1 dB for 100 kHz input sine wave, which is higher than that of a 0.8- mm A/D converter described in <ref> [6] </ref>. Fig. 11 SNDR versus input signal level. In Fig. 12, measured dif ferential nonlinearity (DNL) and integral nonlin earity (INL) vs. input code are plotted. The magnitude of the maximum DNL and INL are 0.5 LSB and 0.6 LSB, respectively.
