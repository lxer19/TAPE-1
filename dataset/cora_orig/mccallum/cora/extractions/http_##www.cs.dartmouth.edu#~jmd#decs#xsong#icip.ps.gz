Abstract: Images are usually transmitted across the Internet using a lossless protocol such as TCP/IP. Lossless protocols require retransmission of lost packets, which substantially increases transmission time. We introduce a fast lossy Internet image transmission scheme (FLIIT) for compressed images which uses forward error correction to eliminate retransmission delays. FLIIT couples an embedded quantization scheme with optimized shielding of important portions of the image. We describe a joint source and channel coding algorithm for images that minimizes the expected distortion resulting both from network packet losses and from inexact quantization of transform coefficients. The algorithm adaptively allocates quantizer resolution bits and redundancy bits to image subbands to control quantization errors and expected packet transmission losses. Our packet loss model incorporates the effects of burst losses using a Markov packet loss model with empirically derived parameters. Our preliminary results show a dramatic reduction in the amount of forward error correction needed to achieve a given expected fidelity as compared to a fixed-rate channel coding scheme.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, experiments in which redundancy was applied uniformly to ATM video packets showed an overall decrease in performance in some cases, due to the increased network load <ref> [2] </ref>. FLIIT's joint source/channel bit allocation scheme enables it to obtain low expected image distortion with far less forward error correction than with uniformly distributed FEC. Bits in standard transform coders differ widely in their contribution to final image fidelity.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION With the rising popularity of Web browsers, image transmission has become one of the largest uses of Internet bandwidth <ref> [4] </ref>. Responsiveness is essential in interactive applications such as browsers, even more so than perfect image fidelity, since many images have already been distorted by lossy compression techniques.

Reference-contexts: The above procedure can be modified to work with subsets of subbands. In <ref> [5] </ref> we describe a coefficient interleaving scheme inspired by [16] that partitions subbands into collections of non-adjacent coefficients. This subdivision delo-calizes errors, reducing their visual impact, and it reduces the length of dependent chains of blocks, thereby reducing the impact of errors in the high-order bitplanes. 2.3. <p> We reduce the long-term correlations between errors experienced by FLIIT by employing a rate-control strategy similar to that of TCP-Vegas [3] that reduces the sending rate in the presence of repeated errors (details can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>). We use a simple first order Markov model to simulate network packet losses. <p> Model parameters were estimated based on the outcomes of 384,000 packets transmitted from Dartmouth College in New Hampshire to Stanford University in California and back over a 24 hour period using the rate control strategy described in <ref> [5] </ref>. We found two basic patterns of behavior: during periods of peak use, the loss rate was high and packet drops were relatively uncorrelated. During periods of low use, loss rates were much lower, but packet drops were slightly more correlated. <p> Leftmost blocks contain the highest order coefficient bit-planes, rightmost the lowest. The coarsest scale subbands are on the bottom and the finest on the top. Note the concentration of FEC on the highest order bits of coarse-scale subbands. replicated. Details of this block protection scheme can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. Table 1 shows that an optimized distribution of forward error correction reduces the expected distortion (expected mean squared error) substantially over fixed-rate distributions. Moreover, the optimized distribution has far less forward error correction overhead. <p> Lower-order planes have a much smaller effect on image distortion, and providing them with heavy shielding from errors is wasteful. FLIIT illustrates the importance of adaptive allocation of forward error correction to compressed data. Preliminary results <ref> [5] </ref> show that FLIIT holds considerable promise for speeding the transmission of images over the Internet. A version of FLIIT using more efficient erasure codes and a more accurate model of Internet packet losses is currently under investigation.

Reference-contexts: Let D j (k) be the reduction in distortion of coefficients in subband j obtained from block k. In our implementation we use squared error as a distortion measure, but perceptually weighted additive measures are equally possible. We obtain a simple compression scheme using marginal analysis <ref> [6] </ref> to determine the number of blocks B j to keep for each subband. The algorithm is initialized with all sub-bands being assigned 0 blocks, i.e. B j = 0 for all j.

Reference-contexts: In our experiments the greedy scheme yields bit allocations identical to those produced by the near-optimal integer pro gramming scheme of Shoham and Gersho <ref> [13] </ref>. 2.2. Joint Source/Channel Coding The above compression scheme minimizes the quantizer-induced distortion by adaptively allocating quantizer resolutions. Packet losses are a second source of distortion. We can control these errors in a similar fashion: by selectively adding redundancy to our bitstream.

Reference-contexts: Layered transmission schemes such as [7][11] incorporate similar ideas, but require networks which treat packets differently according to their priorities. Our FLIIT scheme can function on any network supporting a simple datagram protocol. Similar techniques of joint source/channel coding for continuous bitstreams have been developed in <ref> [14] </ref>, but these algorithms presented rely on computationally expensive Monte Carlo simulations for bit allocation. FLIIT's network packet implementation uses a simple and fast allocation scheme.

Let X k be the event that block k is successfully transmitted, and let F k correspond to the level of forward error correction applied to block k.
