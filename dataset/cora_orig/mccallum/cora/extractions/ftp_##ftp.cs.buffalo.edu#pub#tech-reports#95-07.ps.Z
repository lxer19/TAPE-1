Abstract: To ensure the production of reliable circuits and fully testable unpackaged dies for MCMs burn-in, both dynamic and monitored, remains a feasible option. During this burn-in process the circuit needs to be stressed for an extended period of time. This requires computation of cyclic input sequences to stress the circuit. A taxanomy of stress related problems for full scan circuits is presented. It is shown that there are efficient ways to compute the sequences for most variations of monitored burn-in problems. The difficulty of computing stress tests for dynamic burn-in problems is discussed. Preliminary experimental results on ISCAS89 benchmark circuits are presented.

Reference-contexts: Until die integrity is guaranteed by qualification of the process that fabricates the die, functional testing and burn-in procedures remain the best viable alternatives <ref> [1] </ref>. Hence, monitored burn-in, a kind of burn-in in which functional testing and burn-in are done at the same time, are becoming popular. There are three different types of Burn-Ins : Static, Dynamic and Monitored.

Reference-contexts: There are three different types of Burn-Ins : Static, Dynamic and Monitored. Selection of a particular technique depends upon the types of defects targeted and the extent to which these defects are activated by various techniques <ref> [2] </ref>. 1 * Static Burn-In: applies a DC bias to the device at an elevated temperature (normally 125 o C ) in a manner predetermined to either forward bias or reverse bias as many junctions as possible within the device.

Reference-contexts: This is called monitored burn-in. There are couple of advantages in using monitored burn-in against dynamic burn-in <ref> [3] </ref>. First, it utilizes the dead time during burn-in in testing. Second, carefully ordered test vectors can stress circuit nodes to their maximum. <p> Since power dissipation due to switching transient current and charging and discharging of output load capacitance is generally more than that due to leakage current [4], dynamic burn-in and monitored burn-in are more widely used <ref> [3] </ref>. In this paper, we consider dynamic and monitored burn-in. During burn-in, cyclic sequences need to be applied over an extended period of time such that the average switching activity for a targeted set of nodes is maximized. To our knowledge no systematic study of these problems exists.

Reference-contexts: Third, if a junction breaks down during burn-in, monitored burn-in will make it easier to detect the location of the fault. Since power dissipation due to switching transient current and charging and discharging of output load capacitance is generally more than that due to leakage current <ref> [4] </ref>, dynamic burn-in and monitored burn-in are more widely used [3]. In this paper, we consider dynamic and monitored burn-in. During burn-in, cyclic sequences need to be applied over an extended period of time such that the average switching activity for a targeted set of nodes is maximized. <p> Polynomially solvable problems, solutions and experimental results are discussed in section 5. Intractability issues of dynamic burn-in problems are discussed in section 6. 2 2 Power Dissipation Model The two components of power dissipated in a CMOS circuit <ref> [4] </ref> are: Static dissipation due to leakage current or other current drawn continuously from the power supply (P st ) and dynamic dissipation due to (i) switching transient current (P sc ) and (ii) charging and discharging of load capacitances (P d ).

Reference-contexts: To our knowledge no systematic study of these problems exists. The main purpose of this paper is to study solutions to these problems in the context of Full Integrated Scan circuits <ref> [5] </ref>. It is shown that computation of cyclic stress tests can be done efficiently for most problems pertinent to monitored burn-in. For these problems we present optimal, polynomial time algorithms. In addition, faster heuristics for large circuits that compute near optimal solutions is presented. The paper is organized as follows. <p> Typically during scan in, the values of the primary inputs are kept constant until the scan part of the vector is completely scanned in <ref> [5] </ref>. If this constraint is dropped then primary input vector can be switched during any clock cycle during the scan in process. Let switching time denote the clock cycle at which the primary inputs are switched. Consider the transition 0000 ! 1111 in the circuit in Figure 1 (a). <p> On the other hand, problems SS-AV and MS-AV are useful during dynamic burn in. 4 Accounting for Power Dissipation in Full Scan Circuits Block diagram of Full Integrated Scan is shown in Figure 3 <ref> [5] </ref>. C is the combinational part of the circuit while R is the test register where the tests are scanned serially. Note that as a new vector is scanned in, the input to the combinational circuit C changes. <p> However, a c-node may not have a stuck-at test vector for two reasons. (1) The node may not be sensitizable <ref> [5] </ref> or; (2) the fault may not be propagated to a primary output. In case (1) no activity can be generated at the node.

Reference-contexts: The total power dissipation P total is given by :- P total = P st + P d + P sc . As in <ref> [6] </ref> P st and P sc are neglected. P d is power required to charge and discharge the output capacitive load of every gate.

Reference-contexts: Thus it can be observed that weight of the minimum average weighted cycle is 3 viz. hs; v 2 ; v 1 i. Experiments were performed on ISCAS89 benchmark circuits <ref> [8] </ref> on SUN sparcII machine. Table 5 gives the number of c-nodes, s-nodes and h-nodes in the ISCAS89 circuits.

Reference-contexts: However, in case (2) a pair of vectors may exist that causes the output of the gate to switch but a stuck-at test vector may not exist. This motivates the need for a method of generating activity at the output of such c-nodes. A direct reduction from satisfiability <ref> [9] </ref> would show that this problem is intractable. Note that in case of multiple c-node case the problem is at least as hard as the single c-node case.

Reference-contexts: In fact, multiple c-node case is equivalent to computation of worst case power dissipation in a combinational circuit when the activity in all the c-nodes is considered together. We feel that the techniques of Davadas et. al. <ref> [10] </ref> and Kriplani et. al. [11] can be used in this context. In case of s-nodes an optimal algorithm was discussed which computes a cyclic sequence with maximum average activity.
