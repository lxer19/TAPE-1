Abstract: Conditional logics play an important role in recent attempts to investigate default reasoning. This paper investigates first-order conditional logic. We show that, as for first-order probabilistic logic, it is important not to confound statistical conditionals over the domain (such as most birds fly), and subjective conditionals over possible worlds (such as I believe that Tweety is unlikely to fly). We then address the issue of ascribing semantics to first-order conditional logic. As in the propositional case, there are many possible semantics. To study the problem in a coherent way, we use plausibility structures. These provide us with a general framework in which many of the standard approaches can be embedded. We show that while these standard approaches are all the same at the propositional level, they are significantly different in the context of a first-order language. We show that plausibilities provide the most natural extension of conditional logic to the first-order case: We provide a sound and complete axiomatization that contains only the KLM properties and standard axioms of first-order modal logic. We show that most of the other approaches have additional properties, which result in an inappropriate treatment of an infinitary version of the lottery paradox.

Reference-contexts: This inconsistency suggests that we might not always want to use (4) to represent birds typically fly. After all, the former is a statement about a property believed to hold of each individual bird, while the latter is a statement about the class of birds. As argued in <ref> (Bacchus et al. 1994) </ref>, defaults often arise from statistical facts about the domain. That is, the default birds typically fly is often a consequence of the empirical observation that almost all birds fly. <p> By defining a logic which allows us to express statistical conditional statements, we provide the user an alternative way of representing such defaults. We would, of course, like such statements to impact our beliefs about individual birds. In <ref> (Bacchus et al. 1994) </ref>, the same issue was addressed in the probabilistic context, by presenting an approach for going from statistical knowledge bases to subjective degrees of belief. We leave the problem of providing a similar mechanism for conditional logic to future work. <p> While we also do not have a general solution to the problem of irrelevance, we believe that plausibility structures give us the tools to study it in an abstract setting. We suspect that many of the intuitions behind probabilistic approaches that allow us to cope with irrelevance <ref> (Bacchus et al. 1994) </ref> can also be brought to bear here. We hope to return to this issue in future work. Acknowledgements We would like to thank Ronen Brafman, Ron Fagin, and Adam Grove for their comments on an earlier version of the paper.

Reference-contexts: Many seemingly different approaches have been proposed for giving semantics to conditional logic, including preferential structures (Lewis 1973; Boutilier 1994; Kraus, Lehmann, & Magidor 1990), *-semantics (Adams 1975; Pearl 1989), possibility theory <ref> (Benferhat, Dubois, & Prade 1992) </ref>, and -rankings (Spohn 1987; Goldszmidt & Pearl 1992). In preferential structures, for example, a model consists of a set of possible worlds, ordered by a preference ordering .

F6 is known as the Barcan formula; it describes the relationship between 2 and 8 in structures where all the worlds have the same domain (as is the case here). <p> In the case of first-order logic, it suffices to define substitutable so as to make sure this does not happen (see <ref> (Enderton 1972) </ref> for details). However, in modal logics such as this one, we have to be a little more careful. As we observed in Section 3, we cannot substitute terms for universally quantified variables in a modal context, since terms are not in general rigid.

Reference-contexts: These variants are quite different from each other. However, as shown in (Friedman & Halpern 1996), we can provide a uniform framework for all of them using the notion of plausibility measures. In fact, plausibility measures generalize other types of measures, including probability measures (see <ref> (Friedman & Halpern 1995) </ref>). A plausibility measure Pl on W is a function that maps subsets of W to elements in some arbitrary partially ordered set. We read Pl (A) as the plausibility of set A. If Pl (A) Pl (B), then B is at least as plausible as A.

Reference-contexts: A plausibility measure associates with set of worlds its plausibility, which is just an element in a partially ordered space. Probability measures are a subclass of plausibility measures, in which the plausibilities lie in [0; 1], with the standard ordering. In <ref> (Friedman & Halpern 1996) </ref>, it is shown that the different standard approaches to conditional logic can all be mapped to plausibility measures, if we interpret Bird!Fly as the set of worlds where Bird ^ Fly holds has greater plausibility than that of the set of worlds where Bird ^ :Fly holds. <p> We leave the problem of providing a similar mechanism for conditional logic to future work. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the various approaches to conditional logic in the propositional case; we also review the defi-nition of plausibility measures from <ref> (Friedman & Halpern 1996) </ref> and show how they provide a common framework for these different approaches. In Section 3, we discuss the two ways in which we can extend propositional conditional logic to first-orderstatistical conditionals and subjective conditionalsand ascribe semantics to both using plausibilities. <p> PPD structures were introduced in (Goldszmidt, Morris, & Pearl 1993) as a reformulation of Pearl's *-semantics (Pearl 1989). These variants are quite different from each other. However, as shown in <ref> (Friedman & Halpern 1996) </ref>, we can provide a uniform framework for all of them using the notion of plausibility measures. In fact, plausibility measures generalize other types of measures, including probability measures (see (Friedman & Halpern 1995)). <p> Intuitively, '! holds vacuously if ' is impossible; otherwise, it holds if ' ^ is more plausible than ' ^ : . It is easy to see that this semantics for conditionals generalizes the semantics of conditionals in possibility structures and -structures. As shown in <ref> (Friedman & Halpern 1996) </ref>, it also generalizes the semantics of conditionals in preferential structures and PPD structures. <p> A3. If Pl (A) = Pl (B) =?, then Pl (A [ B) =?. A plausibility space (W; Pl) is qualitative if it satisfies A2 and A3. A plausibility structure (W; Pl; ) is qualitative if (W; Pl) is a qualitative plausibility space. In <ref> (Friedman & Halpern 1996) </ref> it is shown that, in a very general sense, qualitative plausibility structures capture default reasoning. More precisely, the KLM properties are sound with respect to a class of plausibility structures if and only if the class consists of qualitative plausibility structures. <p> As mentioned above, there are two distinct notions of conditionals in first-order logic, one involving statistical conditionals and one involving subjective conditionals. For each of these, we use a different syntax, 4 Due to space limitations we do not review the KLM properties here; see <ref> (Friedman & Halpern 1996) </ref> in this proceedings. analogous to the syntax used in (Halpern 1990) for the probabilistic case. The syntax for statistical conditionals is fairly straightforward.

Reference-contexts: For example, if (w)(c) 6= (w 0 )(c), the constant c denotes different individuals in w and w 0 . Because terms are not rigid designators, we cannot substitute terms for universally quantified variables. (A similar phenomenon holds in other modal logics where terms are not rigid <ref> (Garson 1977) </ref>.) For example, let 2' be an abbreviation for :'!false. Notice that (PL; w) j= 2' if Pl ([[:']]) =?; i.e., 2' asserts that the plausibility of :' is the same as that of the empty set, so that ' is true almost everywhere.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the additional properties that we get from using these approaches are not the ones we want. The properties we get are related to the treatment of exceptional individuals. This issue is perhaps best illustrated by the lottery paradox <ref> (Kyburg 1961) </ref>. 2 Suppose we believe about a lottery that any particular individual typically does not win the lottery. <p> we get 8x (true!:Winner (x)): (1) However, we believe that typically someone does win the lottery, that is true!9xWinner (x): (2) 1 By way of contrast, there is no (recursively enumerable) axiomatization of first-order probabilistic logic (Halpern 1990). 2 We are referring to Kyburg's original version of the lottery paradox <ref> (Kyburg 1961) </ref>, and not to the finitary version discussed by Poole (1991). As Poole showed, any logic of defaults that satisfies certain minimal propertiesproperties which are satisfied by all the logics we consideris bound to suffer from his version of the lottery paradox.
