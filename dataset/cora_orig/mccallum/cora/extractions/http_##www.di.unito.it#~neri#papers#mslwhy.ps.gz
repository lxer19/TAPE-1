Title: Multi-Strategy Learning and Theory Revision  
Author: Lorenza Saitta Marco Botta Filippo Neri 
Keyword: Multi-Strategy learning, Causal models, Abduction, Diagnostic expert systems

Abstract: This paper presents the system WHY, which learns and updates a diagnostic knowledge base using domain knowledge and a set of examples. The a-priori knowledge consists of a causal model of the domain, stating the relationships among basic phenomena, and a body of phenomenological theory, describing the links between abstract concepts and their possible manifestations in the world. The phenomenological knowledge is used deductively, the causal model is used abductively and the examples are used inductively. The problems of imperfection and intractability of the theory are handled by allowing the system to make assumptions during its reasoning. In this way, robust knowledge can be learned with limited complexity and limited number of examples. The system works in a first order logic environment and has been applied in a real domain.

Reference-contexts: We shall now describe how the above mentioned ideas have been implemented in the system WHY, developed as an extension of the learning system ML-SMART <ref> (Bergadano, Giordana & Saitta, 1988) </ref>, in which inductive and deductive techniques have already been integrated (Bergadano & Giordana, 1988).

More precisely, let F be a set of (structured) events and j (o) (x 1 ,x 2 , ... ,x k ) an operational formula. <p> Multiple bindings between variables in the formulas and parts in the examples are allowed: this feature proved to be very useful during the justification process, as explained in the next sections.

Reference-contexts: Then, the obtained rules may not be consistent. This case requires a session of rule refinement. 5.2. Knowledge Refinement Knowledge refinement will only be briefly outlined here, because it has already been discussed elsewhere <ref> (Botta, Giordana & Saitta, 1990) </ref>. It is not necessary that knowledge refinement is invoked on a KB acquired as described in the previous subsection. On the contrary, the KB may come from a different source, for instance, from an expert.

Reference-contexts: P contains structural information about objects and definitions of relevant categories and their taxonomic organization; but, more importantly, P contains a set of rules aimed at describing the manifestations of abstractly defined concepts, i.e., reexpressing them in terms of operational predicates <ref> (Keller, 1988) </ref>. The knowledge P , even if necessary in order to fill the gap between abstract entities and their possible manifestations, can only explain how things happen, but not why.
