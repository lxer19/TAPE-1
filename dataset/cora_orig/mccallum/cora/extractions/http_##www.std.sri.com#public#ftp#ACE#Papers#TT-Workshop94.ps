Title: Interoperability: The Grand Challenge for Collaboration  
Author: Edited by Earl Craighill 
Abstract: Page 1 November 2, 1994 5:54 PM Working Group Report on Technology Trends Abstract The purpose of this paper is to discuss technologies that will have a profound impact on people's use of collaboration. Our focus is on technologies that will be in corporate use or in the marketplace in 5 to 10 years. We anticipate a variety of collaboration technologies, hardware implementations, and software platforms. User hardware will range from personal digital assistants (PDAs) to telephones to traditional workstations. User interfaces will range from active documents to interactive catalogs to virtual reality. Network connections will range from direct optical fiber to traditional Ethernet to wireless. For collaboration environments to be effective, there must be a high degree of interoperability among this multitude of collaboration modalities. Marketplace competition could result in a modern "Tower of Babel" with isolated niche applications that will not support collaboration between segments. This paper discusses emerging technology trends and suggests how interoperability can be achieved through standardization of a basic corpus that spans information representation, user interactions, and information transport and exchange. This corpus is then extended for application and taskspecific environments through negotiation schemes for interoperability among emerging and legacy systems. The services enabled by the World Wide Web (WWW)[1] and MIME[2] protocols are current-day examples of such a structure, and have invoked a large popular response. However, the services are limited to information retrieval and annotations. Distributed object technology, which is becoming available commercially for software engineering applications, offers more advanced distributed computing services. This paper recommends that distributed object services be merged with the WWW/MIME protocols to support the advanced collaboration services we envision in the twenty-first century.

Reference-contexts: These two parameters need to be supported at the IP level; current implementation of IPv4 does not support this feature. However, ST-II (Stream based IP) <ref> [15] </ref> from BBN will permit the ability to allocate and reserve bandwidth between endpoints, thereby ensuring some level of QOS. Another important issue here is billing.

Reference-contexts: Another important issue here is billing. Access to such IP-based services should be billed based on QOS and network-bandwidth use, not on subscription. o Mobile computing Page 11 November 2, 1994 5:54 PM Mobile computing based on IP should look carefully into MBONE <ref> [16] </ref>. The class-D addressing schemes based on loose logical memberships can be used for Mobile IP [17]. Therefore, even if your IP (class A, B, C) address keeps changing with change in physical location, you can still bind to the same logical class-D Multicast address for all your communication needs.
