Title: Closure Lattices  
Author: John L. Pfaltz 
Date: October 4, 1994  
Affiliation: University of Virginia  
Abstract: Closure spaces have been previously investigated by Paul Edelman and Robert Jami-son as "convex geometries". Consequently, a number of the results given here duplicate theirs. However, we employ a slightly different, but equivalent, defining axiom which gives a new flavor to our presentation. The major contribution is the definition of a partial order on all subsets, not just closed (or convex) subsets. It is shown that the subsets of a closure space, so ordered, form a lattice with regular, though non-modular, properties. Investigation of this lattice becomes our primary focus.

Reference-contexts: In all these cited works, the partial order on the power set is by subset inclusion and it is only the lattice of closed subsets that has interesting structure. Adachi, in <ref> [1] </ref>, proposed a different partial order which explicitly involved a closure operator. 1 But, the power set so ordered is only a semi-lattice. In this paper we introduce a partial ordering of the subsets of 2 U induced by any closure operator '. <p> We have observed that the partial ordering on 2 U developed by Adachi <ref> [1] </ref> yields only a semi-lattice. A major result of this paper is the demonstration that for any uniquely generated closure, ', the partial ordering of 2 U defined by (1) is in fact a lattice.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, approaching this material from a different direction leads to different insights that appear to be of value in both lattice theory and computer applications.

Reference-contexts: In [18] the author defined a convexity concept in directed graphs and demonstrated that the collection of convex subsets, partially ordered by inclusion, formed a lower semi-modular lattice.

By a generator of Z, denoted Z:gen ' , we mean a minimal set Y such that Y:' = Z. <p> By lemma 3.1 (a), X:'[fpg is closed, and so X:'[fpg = Y:' implying jY:'j = jX:'j+1.

In the following development, we will make exclusive use of C5, which we choose to call the unique generation property.

These can be restated in terms of X fpg rather than X [ fpg.
