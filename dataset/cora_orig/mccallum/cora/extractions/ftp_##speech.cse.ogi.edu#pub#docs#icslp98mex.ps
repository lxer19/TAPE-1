Title: CREATING A MEXICAN SPANISH VERSION OF THE CSLU TOOLKIT

Abstract: The CSLU Toolkit is designed to facilitate the rapid development of spoken dialogue systems for a wide variety of applications, as well as to provide a framework for conducting research in the underlying speech technologies. This paper describes the creation of a Mexican Spanish version of the CSLU Toolkit (both synthesis and recognition) undertaken at the Universidad de las Amricas in Puebla, Mxico. Based on the Festival Speech Synthesis System of the University of Edinburgh, we have developed a complete concatenative text-to-speech system for Mexican Spanish, which is currently incorporated into the toolkit and includes both a male and female voice. In the area of recognition, we have created a set of taskspecific Spanish recognizers for continuous digits, spelled words, and yes/no phrases, as well as a "general-purpose" phonetic recognizer suitable for arbitrary sub-domains. Using the Rapid Application Developer (RAD) component of the CSLU Toolkit, it is now possible to quickly prototype spoken dialogue systems in Spanish. The Spanish components of the CSLU Toolkit are freely available for noncommercial use from the following web page: http://info.pue.udlap.mx/~sistemas/tlatoa.

INTRODUCTION The CSLU toolkit is designed to facilitate the rapid development of spoken dialogue systems for a wide variety of applications, as well as to provide a framework for conducting research in the underlying speech technologies <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. Freely available for noncommercial use, the CSLU Toolkit enables research groups with modest budgets to quickly begin conducting research and developing applications. This arrangement is particularly pertinent in Latin America, where the financial support and experience otherwise necessary to support such research is not readily available.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we describe the creation of a general-purpose phonetic recognizer and, for comparison, provide results obtained by this recognizer on the same test set of read digits. 2. SYNTHESIS Text-to-speech in the CSLU Toolkit is based on the Festival Speech Synthesis System of the University of Edinburgh <ref> [3] </ref>. In Festival, synthesis is based on the concatenation of units selected from a preexisting corpus; thus the creation of such a corpus was the first step in adding a voice for a new language. 2.1.

Reference-contexts: Letter-to-Phoneme, Syllabification, and Accentuation Rules Spanish orthography is very regular, such that letter-to-phoneme rules are fairly straightforward and accurate. The dictionary of exceptions, compared to that in English, is relatively small. Once translated into phonemes, each word is divided into syllables according to the following algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>. Traversing from right to left, each phoneme is checked against its neighbor to the left. A fixed lookup-table (Table 2) determines whether or not the left phoneme can belong to the same syllable as the current phoneme.

Reference-contexts: Duration and Intonation Modules The duration of a given phoneme is predicted heuristically based on syllabification information. The basic assumption is that phonemes are shortened within long syllables and lengthened within short ones, thus maintaining a relatively constant duration for each syllable <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Combined with particular domain-specific vocabularies and grammars, the general-purpose recognizer can be used to create arbitrary taskspecific sub-dialogues without the need for retraining.) A simple, context-independent general-purpose recognizer was trained from Spanish data in CSLU's Multi-Language Telephone Speech (MLTS) corpus <ref> [7] </ref>. The corpus consists of 81 one-minute recordings of unconstrained spontaneous speech, phonetically labeled by hand at the Center for Spoken Language Understanding. The callers are U.S. residents who are native speakers of Spanish, from both Latin America and Spain.
