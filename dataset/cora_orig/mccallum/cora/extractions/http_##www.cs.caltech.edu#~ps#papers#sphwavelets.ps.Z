Abstract: In this paper we construct explicitly wavelets on the sphere that provide a locally supported and stable (or unconditional) basis for the Sobolev spaces H s ; 0 s &lt; 1. We get at hand a fast wavelet transform with almost optimal complexity. Our construction yields continuous wavelets that are bilinear w.r.t. some special spherical grid. A numerical example confirms that in our approach the poles are not exceptional points concerning the approximation power or the stability of the wavelet basis. Due to the simple data structure and the explicit construction principle this basis can be easily implemented in any numerical scheme that makes use of spherical wavelets as trial functions.

Reference-contexts: Freeden and his coworkers, see [11] and the references therein. They construct radialsymmetric wavelets with arbitrary smoothness. But again there is no fast wavelet transform, nor is it clear how to extend their approach to more general geometries. S. Dahlke, W. Dahmen, E. Schmitt and I. Weinreich <ref> [5] </ref> follow a tensor product approach using exponential splines. Their construction bases on a fixed chart for the sphere. It yields C 1 -wavelets, but it suffers from certain problems at the poles when projecting functions onto the wavelet spaces and the implementation seems to be difficult. <p> In a similar spirit, D. Potts and M. Tasche [21] use tensor products of trigonometric and algebraic polynomials to construct interpolatory spherical wavelets with global support that allow a fast wavelet transform. Again the poles are exceptional points since the underlying grid accumulates there. Hence, as in <ref> [5] </ref>, these wavelets are not able to detect singularities at the poles. To overcome this difficulty, D. Potts, G. Steidl and M. Tasche [20] use spherical harmonics instead of tensor product polynomials. This results in smooth, but again globally supported wavelets.

Reference-contexts: However, due to the discontinuity in the trial functions their approach seems not to be adequate for the numerical solution of differential equations. Finally, an abstract construction of wavelets on tangent bundles of spheres is given by S. Dahlke and P. Maa <ref> [6] </ref>. In the present paper we mainly focus on the construction of spherical wavelets rather than on applications, but we also give some remarks concerning data compression and singularity detection.

Reference-contexts: To overcome this difficulty, D. Potts, G. Steidl and M. Tasche [20] use spherical harmonics instead of tensor product polynomials. This results in smooth, but again globally supported wavelets. Nevertheless, the fast Fourier transform provides a fast wavelet transform in this setting. W. Dahmen, S. Prodorf and R. Schneider <ref> [9] </ref> develop a very powerful, but abstract method for the construction of wavelet bases on smooth manifolds.

Reference-contexts: It is a hard problem to decide whether a given subdivision scheme converges or not. Furthermore, even if it is possible to prove its convergence, in general there is no analytic expression for the biorthogonal functionals. Maybe the construction of the famous Daubechies wavelets <ref> [10] </ref> is the best example for the complexity of this problem even for the simplest geometry.

Reference-contexts: Hence these wavelets have global support and do not allow a fast wavelet transform.

Reference-contexts: At this point we have at hand a basis 0 (0) [ f 0 (j) ; j 2 IN 0 g of L 2 (). This is just a hierarchic spline basis as introduced by H. Yserentant <ref> [28] </ref>. Although computationally easy to handle, unfortunately this basis is not stable. Using the lifting scheme as introduced by W. Sweldens (see [26] and the references given therein for a more detailed description), we will modify it to become a wavelet basis in the sense of definition 2.1.
