Reference-contexts: Section 2 gives an overview of this work. A team at IBM Almaden including Rakesh Agrawal, Ashish Gupta, and Sunita Sarawagi independently explored similar approaches to this problem; for more details please consult our joint paper in VLDB96, available as <ref> [AAD+96] </ref> or from http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~pmd/papers/vldb96/Article.PS. To speed up multidimensional data analysis, database systems frequently precompute aggregates on some subsets of dimensions and their corresponding hierarchies. This is related to the "computing the cube" problem in that a common tactic is to precompute some or all of the cube. <p> In particular, they always perform substantially better than the method of computing the CUBE by a sequence of group-by statements, which is the only option in many commercial relational database systems. For more detail on this work please consult either <ref> [AAD+96] </ref> or http://www.cs.wisc.edu/ pmd/papers/vldb96/Article.PS. 3 Storage Explosion and the Cube As noted in the introduction, multidimensional data analysis, as supported by OLAP systems, requires the computation of several large aggregate functions over large amounts of data.

Reference-contexts: The SQL for these four group bys (in the above order) is: select SUM (Quantity) from sales; select ProductId, SUM (Quantity) from sales group by ProductId; select StoreId, SUM (Quantity) from sales group by StoreId; 1 This example is from <ref> [AGS95] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We have considered three solutions. For the first solution, if the data is assumed to be uniformly distributed, we can mathematically approximate the number of tuples that will appear in the result of the cube computation using the following standard result. Feller <ref> [Fel57] </ref>: If r elements are chosen uniformly and at random from a set of n elements, the expected number of distinct elements obtained is n n (1 1=n) r . 8 This can be used to quickly find the upper bound on the size of the cube as follows.

Reference-contexts: We use this idea to construct an algorithm that estimates the size of the cube based on the following probabilistic algorithm which counts the number of distinct elements in a multi-set. 9 Flajolet and Martin <ref> [FM85] </ref> propose a probabilistic algorithm that counts the number of distinct elements in a multi-set. It makes the estimate after a single pass through the database, and using only a fixed amount of additional storage.

Conf. on Data Engg., </booktitle> <pages> pp 152-159, </pages> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: The SQL community has also taken notice of the requirement for simultaneous multidimensional aggregation; in particular, there are proposals for extending SQL to include the "cube" operator as proposed by Gray et al. <ref> [GBLP96] </ref>. This operator computes aggregates over all subsets of dimensions specified in the "cube" operation, and is equivalent to the union of a number of standard group-by operations. <p> Gray et al. <ref> [GBLP96] </ref> proposed the "cube" operator to formalize this sort of simultaneous aggregation and to express it in SQL. The "cube" operator is the n-dimensional generalization of the group-by operator.

Reference-contexts: This leaves the database administrator with a difficult problem: how does one predict the 5 amount of storage a specified set of precomputations will require without actually performing the pre--computation? (Harinarayanan et al. <ref> [HRU96] </ref> considered the related problem of which aggregates are best to precompute and store if only a given number of them can be stored.) To further clarify the problem we are considering, we begin with an example 1 .

Reference-contexts: In Section 3 we describe three strategies we have evaluated for this problem: one based on sampling, one based on mathematical approximation, and one based on probabilistic counting. Full details on this work are available in either <ref> [SDNR96] </ref> or from http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~samit/vldb96.ps. Finally, it is clear from a look at the OLAP industry today that array-based storage structures are an important alternative to tables for storing multidimensional data. This has manifested in the heated "MOLAP/ROLAP" marketing wars. <p> But in most cases, the algorithm of choice for a reasonably quick and accurate estimate of the size of the cube is the algorithm based on probabilistic counting. For more details on this work please consult either <ref> [SDNR96] </ref> or from http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~samit/vldb96.ps. 4 An Object-Relational ADT Alternative to Tables An interesting question is what storage structure should be used to hold multidimensional data for OLAP queries. One logical option is relational tables. Suppose we wish to store a 3-D array of integers in a table.
