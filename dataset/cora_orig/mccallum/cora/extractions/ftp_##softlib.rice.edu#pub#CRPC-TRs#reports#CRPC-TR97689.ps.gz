Abstract: This paper is to appear in SINUM Abstract. Various sophisticated finite element models for surface water flow based on the shallow water equations exist in the literature. Gray, Kolar, Luettich, Lynch and Westerink have developed a hydrodynamic model based on the generalized wave continuity equation (GWCE) formulation, and have formulated a Galerkin finite element procedure based on combining the GWCE with the nonconservative momentum equations. Numerical experiments suggest that this method is robust, accurate and suppresses spurious oscillations which plague other models. We analyze a slightly modified Galerkin model which uses the conservative momentum equations (CME). For this GWCE-CME system of equations, we present a continous-time a priori error estimate based on an L 2 projection.

Reference-contexts: Early finite element simulations of shallow water systems were plagued by spurious oscillations. Various methods were introduced to eliminate these oscillations through artificial diffusion [17, 22]. These methods were generally unsuccessful due to excessive damping of physical components of the solution. Recently, Agoshkov et al <ref> [2, 4, 3] </ref> have investigated a finite element approximation, where the velocity field is approximated by piecewise linear polynomials and the elevation is approximated by the same functions plus some additional ones.
