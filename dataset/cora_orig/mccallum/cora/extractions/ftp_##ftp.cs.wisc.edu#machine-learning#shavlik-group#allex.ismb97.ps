Abstract: We present a new method for determining the consensus sequence in DNA fragment assemblies. The new method, Trace-Evidence, directly incorporates aligned ABI trace information into consensus calculations via our previously described representation, TraceData Classifications. The new method extracts and sums evidence indicated by the representation to determine consensus calls. Using the Trace-Evidence method results in automatically produced consensus sequences that are more accurate and less ambiguous than those produced with standard majority- voting methods. Additionally, these improvements are achieved with less coverage than required by the standard methods using Trace-Evidence and a coverage of only three, error rates are as low as those with a coverage of over ten sequences.

Reference-contexts: The base calls are used to align the sequences and then a majority-voting scheme is commonly used to identify the consensus for each aligned column of bases. We believe, and have shown with an earlier case study in sequence trimming <ref> (Allex et al. 1996) </ref>, that automatic sequencing processes can be improved by incorporation of descriptive fluorescent trace information. The new method we have developed for automatic consensus calling, Trace-Evidence, incorporates ABI trace information via the TraceData Classifications we defined in prior work (Allex et al. 1996). <p> with an earlier case study in sequence trimming <ref> (Allex et al. 1996) </ref>, that automatic sequencing processes can be improved by incorporation of descriptive fluorescent trace information. The new method we have developed for automatic consensus calling, Trace-Evidence, incorporates ABI trace information via the TraceData Classifications we defined in prior work (Allex et al. 1996). The use of this representation is the key to the improvements we see when using our new method.

SeqMan uses the Majority consensus calling method. (SeqMan has since been superseded by SeqMan II, a more powerful version that incorporates trace analysis as described in this and a previous paper <ref> (Allex et al. 1996) </ref>.) Method Fragment assemblies for a 124 kb section of E. coli are used to compare correct calls to Majority and Trace- Evidence calls. The data and correct calls for the assemblies were supplied by the E. coli Genome Project at the University of Wisconsin.

Reference-contexts: Higher accuracy using Trace-Evidence consensus calling mitigates the problem of errors in DNA sequences. The error rate for sequences in GenBank has been estimated to be from 0.3 to 0.03% <ref> (Lawrence & Solovyev 1994) </ref>. If the DNA is translated into protein, the results are potential errors in 0.1 to 0.01% of the amino acids. The mutation of a single amino acid can have substantial adverse effects on protein-related research.

Previous Method: Majority A common, simple method to calculate the consensus counts the number of calls of each base in an aligned column <ref> (Staden 1982) </ref>. If the majority base count is above a given fractional threshold of the total count, that base is called unambiguously (A, C, G, or T); otherwise the consensus is called as the appropriate ambiguity (combination of A, C, G, and/or T). We refer to this method as Majority.
