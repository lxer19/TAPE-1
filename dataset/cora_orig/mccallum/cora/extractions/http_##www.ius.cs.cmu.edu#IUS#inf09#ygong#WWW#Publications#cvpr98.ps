Abstract: We propose a new image retrieval method based on human perceptual clustering of color images. This color clustering produces for each image a small set of representative colors which captures the color properties of the image, and a small set of sizable contiguous regions which captures the spatial/geometrical properties of the image. The proposed method outperforms the traditional histogram and its improved methods not only with its richer image retrieval capabilities which cover a wider spectrum of user requirements, but also with its powerful indexing scheme which is essential to cater for large scale image databases.

Reference-contexts: Stricker and Dimai <ref> [1] </ref> divided an image into five fixed overlapping blocks and extracted the first three color moments of each block to form a feature vector for the image. The use of color moments largely reduces the size of the feature vector and simplifies the creation of an effective database indexing scheme.

Reference-contexts: However, matching images based on a small number of derived color features could further decrease image discrimination powers of the system, and dividing an image into five fixed regions is not sufficient to represent spatial properties of the image. Pass and Zabih <ref> [2] </ref> incorporated the spatial coherence feature into color histograms. A pixel is considered coherent if it is a part of some sizable contiguous regions, and incoherent otherwise.

Reference-contexts: Based on this definition, pixels in each histogram bin are partitioned into either the coherent class or the incoherent class, and histogram matching is performed by comparing the corresponding classes in the corresponding bins. Huang, et al. <ref> [3] </ref> proposed the correlogram to take into account the local color spatial correlation as well as the global distribution of this spatial correlation.

Reference-contexts: To solve the above problem, we propose to adaptively cluster color images based on human color perceptions. A 24-bit color image contains up to 16 million colors. Most of the colors can not be differentiated by human beings, because human eyes are relatively less sensitive to colors. Research <ref> [4] </ref> has found that in the HVC color space, the space that represents colors along human color perceptual dimensions, colors with the NBS color distance below 3.0 are perceived to be almost the same color by human beings.

Reference-contexts: This aggregation degree is a feature that tells whether pixels belonging to cluster S x form a contiguous region or scatter across the image. The cluster feature vectors obtained from all the input images are stored as indexes in a SR-Tree SRT C <ref> [5] </ref>. SR-Tree is an enhanced version of R-Tree that is very efficient for storing medium and high dimensional vectors, as well as for searching nearest neighbors based on multi-dimensional vectors.

Reference-contexts: These images are obtained from six 30-minute CNN Headline News video programs. As a NTSC news video has a frame rate of 30 fps, most consecutive frames have a very similar content. To eliminate redundancies from the video data, we detect scene breaks using the method in <ref> [6] </ref>, and select only the frames before, and after each of the scene breaks. Therefore, our test database is very heterogeneous and diversified, containing images of indoor and outdoor scenes, portrait faces, landscapes, etc.
