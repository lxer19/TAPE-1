Reference-contexts: Section 5 offers some conclusions. 2 Background A simple physical example that can be used to teach curried functions is Newton's law of gravity [New87] <ref> [FLS63, Chapter 7] </ref>. <p> Thus, a more accurate statement of Newton's law uses the concept of vectors <ref> [FLS63, Chapters 11-12] </ref>. The distance from one mass to another is a directed quantity, and so is written as a vector. This vector can be thought of as the coordinates of the second mass in three-dimensional space, and thus has x, y, and z components. <p> A force vector would have forces for its x, y, and z components, where the number in each component tells what part of the force vector can be thought of as directed along each axis. In terms of vectors, Newton's law of gravity can be stated as follows <ref> [FLS63, Chapter 12] </ref>, where ~ F is the force vector, ~r = hr x ; r y ; r z i is the radius vector (the vector from m 1 's location to m 2 's), and r = q x + r 2 z is the distance from m 1 <p> Instead a physicist thinks of a field as a function that assigns to each point in space a quantity <ref> [FLS63, Section 12-4] </ref>. In this view, the gravitational field of the earth is a function that assigns to each point around the earth a vector, whose units are newtons per kilogram. This vector gives the force vector per unit mass at the given point. <p> Maxwell's view of fields is perfectly satisfactory in physics, because fields have a physical reality [Far52] <ref> [FLS63, Chapter 28] </ref>. <p> Maxwell's view of fields is perfectly satisfactory in physics, because fields have a physical reality [Far52] [FLS63, Chapter 28]. As in the Feynman lectures <ref> [FLS63, Section 12-4] </ref>, this view of fields can be thought of as factoring Formula (6) as follows. ~ F = m 2 r 3 (8) This vector quantity, (Gm 1 ~r)=r 3 , is the gravitational field of the mass m 1 .

Reference-contexts: It illustrates the kind of example that can be drawn from physics. (Other examples include the dielectric force law.)

Reference-contexts: The force vector that would result from putting a mass m 2 at such a point is obtained by multiplying this force per unit mass vector by m 2 .
