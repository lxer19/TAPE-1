Title: Experience with the Learning Web  
Author: Mildred L. G. Shaw and Brian R. Gaines 
Address: Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 1N4  
Affiliation: University of Calgary  
Abstract: The learning web approach can be introduced into existing undergraduate courses and doing so provides the basis for its implementation on a larger scale transcending institutional boundaries. However, an essential prerequisite is the restructuring of existing pedagogical approaches, deemphasizing received wisdom and authority of the instructor, and emphasizing collaborative learning and meta-reflection on all aspects of the learning process itself. The instructor becomes a facilitator of students learning to learn, and eventually that process of learning to learn must itself become an overt topic for discussion by students fully participating in its management. In the same way that in the current educational system the home prepares for the school and the school prepares for the university, the university must come to see itself as preparing students for a role in a learning society in which they have come to understand and manage their own processes of lifelong learning. This article describes experience in using the learning web approach and technologies in some senior undergraduate courses in Computer Science.

Reference-contexts: In recent years the gap between customer and user requirements and computing system specification has also become of major concernrequirements engineering is now a major subdiscipline in its own right <ref> [RE, 1993; Shaw and Gaines, 1994] </ref>. Thus, it is natural to introduce psychological and social issues in a software engineering course, and to design project work that gives students personal experience of social phenomena in overt and discussible form.
