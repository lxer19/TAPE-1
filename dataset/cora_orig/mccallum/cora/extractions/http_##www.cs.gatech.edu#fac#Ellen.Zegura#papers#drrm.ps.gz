Abstract: Much of the success of the Internet can be attributed to the IP "hour-glass" model: IP provides a consistent, best-effort service interface that has allowed the relatively independent development of applications and underlying networking technology. As network services and applications become more complex, so does the task of mapping an application to the appropriate service. We propose a Dynamic Resource Reservation Manager (drrm ) that maps application streams into network services. This entity will shield applications from the details of network services, in the same spirit as the hour-glass model of IP. We describe the architecture and implementation of a drrm , and investigate a key problem that must be solved: determining locations to renegotiate connection parameters. We consider the complexity of finding the optimal locations, and propose heuristics for both on-line and offline cases. We evaluate the performance of the heuristics using several application models.

The ASM differs from the drrm in that it is designed specifically for use over ATM.

Reference-contexts: We now provide some description of each of the application models as well as some insight into why each was chosen as a test case for execution with the drrm . MPEG Video MPEG video streams <ref> [6] </ref> have frequent variation in required bandwidth, due to the difference in frame sizes among the I, P, and B frames that comprise this type of compressed video. Not only is the variation in bandwidth requirement frequent, but it is also often of large amplitude.

Reference-contexts: We have designed the drrm high-level architecture as a general platform, of which ATM is just one of many possible implementations. The ASM also does not include algorithms to determine when to renegotiation, nor performance results to evaluate the system. Zhang and Knightly <ref> [8] </ref> have developed both offline and on-line algorithms for determining where, in a video stream to renegotiate. In the off-line, a prioi knowledge case, they iteratively divide the video stream into segments and attempt to isolate those with the worst parameterization. They then base improvements upon those worst locations.
