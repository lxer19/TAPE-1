Title: Hiding the overhead cost of Segment Cleaning in a Log Structured File System.  
Author: Christoph Bregler Srini Narayanan Sridhar Rajagopalan 
Abstract: We study the operation of the segment cleaner in a log structured file system. When the segment cleaner is active, response time for user read requests is adversely affected. Thus, it is desirable to run the segment cleaner when the read traffic is low. We propose a simple strategy for scheduling the segment cleaner that seems to perform an order of magnitude better than a random baseline policy. We predict that implementation of our policy on the existing LFS would improve the degree of user satisfaction with the file system.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction. A recent innovation in file system technology was the notion of a log structured file system <ref> [RO92] </ref>. It was argued that such file systems would capitalize more effectively on the improvement in hardware technologies both in the near and not-so-near future. <p> This places an additional burden on the file system at a time when resources are already scarce. For this reason, we feel that even a random cleaning policy 2 might be superior to the one currently implemented. This motivates the following question, first asked in <ref> [RO92] </ref>: Is it possible to `hide' the segment cleaner from the user? We mean this in the following sense: Is there a way to do segment cleaning so that the user is unable to distinguish between the situation wherein the segment cleaner is in operation and the ideal situation wherein the <p> This affects the efficiency with which the file system uses the disk to write data. The measurements done by Rosenbloom <ref> [RO92] </ref> suggests that on average the amount of write traffic generated by cleaning is fairly small (on the order of 3 8%, and scheduling policies such as ours are unlikely to affect this efficiency. * The segment cleaner increases the latency for read requests while in operation.
