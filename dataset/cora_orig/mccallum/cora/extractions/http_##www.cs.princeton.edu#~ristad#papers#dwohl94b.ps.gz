Title: COMPLEXITY OF MORPHEME ACQUISITION  
Author: ERIC SVEN RISTAD 
Abstract: The words of language contain a nontrivial amount of linguistic information, such as what the word means, how it may be used in a sentence, and how it is to be spoken and written. In this article, we consider the computational problem of learning the linguistic structure of a novel word, as well as that of learning the "overall" morpho-phonology of a language. Our main result is that the computational problem of acquiring the morpho-phonology of a language is NP-complete.

Reference-contexts: In the classic SPE segmental theory of phonology <ref> [3] </ref>, the set of phonological features included "abstracted" phonetic features, diacritic features, and the distinguished feature segment that marks boundaries. Diacritic features were associated with lexical items as a whole; they controlled the application of rules.

A set of phonetic features is said to form a natural class when it behaves as a unit with respect to a natural phonological dependency, such as assimilation.

Reference-contexts: The phonetic system is a model of this vocal tract function, that maps primitive sensory-motor goals to their acoustic realization. 2 A phonetic or articulatory feature is a primitive sensory-motor intention, or in other words, an input to the phonetic system <ref> [7] </ref>. 3 Formally, a phonetic feature is a [feature-name feature-value] pair. There are a finite number of possible feature-names F: 4 F = f advanced, anterior, back, consonantal, continuant, distributed, height, nasal, rounded, sonorant, stiff-vocal-cords, strident, spread-glottis g Feature-values are nonnegative integers drawn from an interval, typically [0,1].
