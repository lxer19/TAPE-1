Title: GENETIC EVOLUTION AND COEVOLUTION OF GAME STRATEGIES  
Author: John R. Koza

Abstract: The problem of discovering a strategy for playing a game can be viewed as requiring discovery of a computer program. This paper describes the recently developed "genetic programming" paradigm which genetically breeds populations of hierarchical computer programs to solve problems. The computer programs are evolved using the Darwinian principle of survival of the fittest and the genetic operation of sexual recombination.

Reference-contexts: In effect, both the plant and the insects get better and better at their respective defensive and offensive roles in this biological arms race. Each species changes in response to the actions of the other <ref> (Dawkins 1987) </ref>. In the basic genetic algorithm described by Holland (1975), a population of individuals attempts to adapt to a fixed environment. The individuals in the population are fixed-length character strings (typically binary strings) that are encoded to represent the problem in some way.

Reference-contexts: John Holland's pioneering 1975 Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems described how the evolutionary process in nature can be applied to artificial systems using the genetic algorithm operating on fixed length character strings <ref> (Holland 1975) </ref>. Holland demonstrated that a population of fixed length character strings (each representing a proposed solution to a problem) can be genetically bred using the Darwinian operation of fitness proportionate reproduction and the genetic operation of recombination.

Reference-contexts: The players choose their respective control variables simultaneously. In the figure, the evader's angle y is shown equal to the pursuer's angle f . (0, 0) X (X, Y) Y The analysis of this game can be simplified by reducing the number of state variables from four to two <ref> (Isaacs 1965) </ref>. This state reduction is accomplished by simply viewing the pursuer P as being at the origin point (0,0) of a new coordinate system at all times and then viewing the evader E as being at position (x, y) in this new coordinate system.
