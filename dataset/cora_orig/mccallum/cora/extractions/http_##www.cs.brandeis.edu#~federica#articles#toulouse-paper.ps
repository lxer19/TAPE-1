Title: The Semantics of Agentive Nominals in the Generative Lexicon

Abstract: In this paper, I examine the set of agentive nominals and argue that, in spite of their heterogenous behavior, we can find generalizations by characterizing their semantic properties in terms of the stage-level and individual -level distinction. This parallel with the domain of predicates provides a useful semantic classification of the class of agentive nouns and explains a range of syntactic phenomena as well as issues of semantic interpretation.

Reference-contexts: In other words, different qualia roles induce a different interpretation on the event that they encode. By viewing qualia roles as introducing different forms of quantification (cf. Pustejovsky, 1996), we can exploit their properties to account for the interpretation of the two classes of agentive nouns. <ref> (cf. Busa, 1996) </ref>. As an example, consider a nominal such as knife, whose telic role expresses the persistent property that this object is for cutting. This linguistic knowledge does not entail that every knife cuts or that a particular knife will be cutting in any given circumstance.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, I show that all agentive nominals are best characterized in terms of events, irrespectively of whether or not the event which defines an individual is presupposed <ref> (cf. Chierchia, 1995, for individual-level predicates) </ref>. The different interpretations emerge as the result of the quantification as well as of the event type of the action that characterizes the agentive noun.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, if the characterizing event is a left-headed transition (e.g. a causative), as in (27), then the defining event has a perfect reading that contributes a state making reference to the agent having completed that action <ref> (cf. Parson, 1990, for this view of the perfect) </ref>. In this case the matrix predicate is related to that state asserting the completion of the event. 6.

Reference-contexts: In the rest of this paper, I will discuss some of the cruicial semantic issues that arise with the set of agentive nominals, and then provide a solution within Generative Lexicon theory (henceforth, GL), <ref> (Pustejovsky, 1995) </ref>, based on the role of events and on the quan-tificational properties of qualia roles. 2. The Basic Distinction Within recent work in lexical semantics, Rappaport and Levin (1992) have observed that the set of agentive nominals splits into two classes.

Reference-contexts: Parson, 1990, Pustejovsky, 1996). Without introducing the formal machinery that expresses the persistency of individuals <ref> (cf. Pustejovsky, 1996, for details) </ref>, I will keep the discussion largely informal, and focus on how persistent and changeable properties can be encoded as part of lexical knowledge. This is the topic of the next section. 4. <p> In other words, different qualia roles induce a different interpretation on the event that they encode. By viewing qualia roles as introducing different forms of quantification <ref> (cf. Pustejovsky, 1996) </ref>, we can exploit their properties to account for the interpretation of the two classes of agentive nouns. (cf. Busa, 1996). As an example, consider a nominal such as knife, whose telic role expresses the persistent property that this object is for cutting. <p> Our generalization can be maintained by adopting a decompositional view of the event structure representation, which treats events as complex objects. In GL theory, different types of transitions are distinguished minimally by the notion of head <ref> (cf. Pustejovsky, 1996) </ref>, which is the most prominent event in an event structure representation and is motivated by a number of grammatical facts (e.g. modifier scope, adjuncts, grammatical alternations, and so on).

Reference-contexts: As observed by a number of authors <ref> (Sproat, 1985, Rappaport and Levin, 1992) </ref>, these two generalizations quickly run into problems in light of derived nominals that denote instruments (e.g. opener, parser, propeller), and verbal forms that lack a correlated agentive noun (e.g. dier, arriver, fearer).
