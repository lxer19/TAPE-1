Abstract: There has been a growing concern about the potential impact of long-term correlations (second-order statistic) in variable-bit-rate (VBR) video traffic on ATM buffer dimensioning. Previous studies have shown that video traffic exhibits long-range dependence (LRD) (Hurst parameter large than 0.5). We investigate the practical implications of LRD in the context of realistic ATM traffic engineering by studying ATM multiplexers of VBR video sources over a range of desirable cell loss rates and buffer sizes (maximum delays). Using results based on large deviations theory, we introduce the notion of Critical Time Scale (CTS). For a given buffer size, link capacity, and the marginal distribution of frame size, the CTS of a VBR video source is defined as the number of frame correlations that contribute to the cell loss rate. In other words, second-order behavior at the time scale beyond the CTS does not significantly affect the network performance. We show that whether the video source model is Markov or has LRD, its CTS is finite, attains a small value for small buffer, and is a non-decreasing function of buffer size. Numerical results show that (i) even in the presence of LRD, long-term correlations do not have significant impact on the cell loss rate; and (ii) short-term correlations have dominant effect on cell loss rate, and therefore, well-designed Markov traffic models are effective for predicting Quality of Service (QOS) of LRD VBR video traffic. Therefore, we conclude that it is unnecessary to capture the long-term correlations of a real-time VBR video source under realistic ATM buffer dimensioning scenarios as far as the cell loss rates and maximum buffer delays are concerned.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction There has been a growing concern about the potential impact of long-term correlations of variable-bit-rate (VBR) video traffic on ATM traffic engineering. This concern is based on two recent findings: (i) VBR video traffic exhibits long-range dependence (Hurst parameter larger than 0.5) <ref> [2] </ref>; (ii) the buffer overflow probability (BOP) 1 of long-range dependent (LRD) video traffic decays hyperbolically [14, 18] or in a Weibull fashion [5, 17]. <p> Despite the fact that these traces were shown to possess long-range dependence by Beran et al <ref> [2] </ref>, Elwalid et al showed that for practical ranges of buffer size and cell loss rate (CLR) 1 , the DAR (1) model, which is a short-range dependent (SRD) process, provides an accurate prediction of CLRs for the purpose of real-time connection acceptance control. <p> While long-term correlations of LRD processes are individually small, their cumulative effect on the CLR is non-negligible <ref> [2] </ref>. 2. The buffer behavior of LRD VBR video traffic cannot be accurately predicted by simple, parsimonious Markov-based (or SRD in general) models [2, 10, 23]. <p> While long-term correlations of LRD processes are individually small, their cumulative effect on the CLR is non-negligible [2]. 2. The buffer behavior of LRD VBR video traffic cannot be accurately predicted by simple, parsimonious Markov-based (or SRD in general) models <ref> [2, 10, 23] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We use the Bahadur-Rao (B-R) Asymptotic of buffer overflow probability of an ATM multiplexer with N sources [16]. We use the following notations <ref> [3, 16] </ref>. Denote by C the constant service rate during the frame duration measured in cells/frame and by fX n g the input process (i.e., the size of n-th frame from N identical sources) in cells. <p> Note that ignoring g 1 (c; b; N ) yields the Large N Asymptotic given by Courcoubetis and Weber <ref> [3] </ref>. Let's examine (8) and (10) with a closer look. <p> For example, for a relatively large m fl b , it has been found that K = 1=(c ) for a Gaussian AR (1) process <ref> [3] </ref> and K = H (1H)(c) for a Gaussian exact LRD process (see Ap pendix). 4 Moreover, m fl 0 is always equal to 1, indicating that correlations do not affect the CLR at all when buffer size is zero. [3, 6]. <p> K = 1=(c ) for a Gaussian AR (1) process [3] and K = H (1H)(c) for a Gaussian exact LRD process (see Ap pendix). 4 Moreover, m fl 0 is always equal to 1, indicating that correlations do not affect the CLR at all when buffer size is zero. <ref> [3, 6] </ref>. From this, we stipulate that for small b, m fl b would be also small.

Reference-contexts: While the above results exhibit Weibull decays, Likhanov et al [14] and Parulekar and Makowski [18] show that for the M=G=1-type model of Cox <ref> [4] </ref>, the tail asymptotic of the BOP decays at most hyperbolically. <p> Also, the increasing rate of V (m) is slower than m 2 , i.e., V (m) 2 [m + O (m 2 )] for SRD processes [8] 2 g (T s )m 2H for exact LRD processes for large m <ref> [4, 8] </ref>. It follows that for fixed b, lim f (c; b; m)=2V (m) = 1; yielding m fl b &lt; 1. This result immediately indicates that for finite buffer size, the cumulative effect of autocorrelations is bounded regardless of the presence of the LRD property, disproving the first claim. <p> Then for large m, we approximate V (m) defined by (10) as V (m) " m X (m k)k # 2 m + 2H (2H 1)g (T s ) 1 2H2 g (T s )m : (11) The above approximation has been found to be accurate even for small m <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This concern is based on two recent findings: (i) VBR video traffic exhibits long-range dependence (Hurst parameter larger than 0.5) [2]; (ii) the buffer overflow probability (BOP) 1 of long-range dependent (LRD) video traffic decays hyperbolically [14, 18] or in a Weibull fashion <ref> [5, 17] </ref>. A direct implication of (ii) is that the notion of effective bandwidth based on Markov models of which the BOP decays exponentially does not apply to LRD traffic (see Section 4 for detail). <p> Also, using the techniques of large deviations theory, Duffield et al <ref> [5] </ref> have shown that under mild conditions, the BOP of LRD traffic, whether exact or asymptotic, is again approximated by Weibull behavior as the buffer size goes to infinity. <p> 2 m + 2 i=1 # 3 We note that similar expression (without the second term in the exponent) has been obtained by Parulekar and Makowski [18] for the discrete-time fractional Gaussian Noise (FGN) process (and thus g (T s ) = 1) using the results of Duffield et al <ref> [5] </ref>. Note that ignoring g 1 (c; b; N ) yields the Large N Asymptotic given by Courcoubetis and Weber [3]. Let's examine (8) and (10) with a closer look. <p> This illustrates why the first claim is not valid under practical ranges of buffer size and CLR. We note that eventually the curves in Fig. 5-(b) will exhibit the same decaying characteristic when buffer size becomes larger and larger, for they all have the same Hurst parameter <ref> [5] </ref>; however, such range of the buffer size is beyond the practical consideration; see Fig. 7.

Reference-contexts: We choose Gaussian frame size distribution to simplify our analysis. It is noted that the Gaussian frame size distribution may not be a universal characterization of video traces; some traces have been found to possess heavier tails than that of the Gaussian distribution <ref> [7] </ref>. As discussed in Section 6, however, we believe that our main results are unlikely to be affected by this assumption.

Reference-contexts: This has led many researchers and practitioners to believe that the LRD property of VBR video traffic will have critical impact on ATM traffic engineering in general. Different, and perhaps opposing viewpoints about the impact of the LRD property also exist, however. Heyman and Lakshman <ref> [8] </ref> and Elwalid et al [6] analyzed several traces of VBR videoconferencing traffic and modeled them using the first-order Discrete Autoregressive processes [DAR (1)] (see Section 3.1 for detail) by matching the marginal distribution of frame size and first-lag correlation. <p> For this reason, we use stochastic VBR video models, unlike the previous studies in which real video traces were used. In particular, we construct LRD video models such that they resemble real traces exhibiting LRD; see <ref> [8] </ref> for examples of such traces. Further, in order to exclude the effect of the marginal distribution (of frame size) on buffer behavior, we set the marginal distributions of all models to be identical so that the first-order statistics do not contribute to the difference in queueing behavior. <p> distribution of fL n g approaches a Gaussian form with mean L and variance 2 L by the central limit theorem [15]. 3.3 fV v , Z a g = FBNDP + DAR (1) Many analyses of VBR real traces show that their short-term correlations are characterized by geometric decay <ref> [8] </ref>. When those traces exhibit the LRD property, mathematically it is represented as power-law decaying long-term correlations; see (1). <p> Also, the increasing rate of V (m) is slower than m 2 , i.e., V (m) 2 [m + O (m 2 )] for SRD processes <ref> [8] </ref> 2 g (T s )m 2H for exact LRD processes for large m [4, 8]. It follows that for fixed b, lim f (c; b; m)=2V (m) = 1; yielding m fl b &lt; 1. <p> Also, the increasing rate of V (m) is slower than m 2 , i.e., V (m) 2 [m + O (m 2 )] for SRD processes [8] 2 g (T s )m 2H for exact LRD processes for large m <ref> [4, 8] </ref>. It follows that for fixed b, lim f (c; b; m)=2V (m) = 1; yielding m fl b &lt; 1. This result immediately indicates that for finite buffer size, the cumulative effect of autocorrelations is bounded regardless of the presence of the LRD property, disproving the first claim. <p> We note that several traces of VBR video-conferencing traffic exhibit the correlation structure similar to Z a (or V v ) <ref> [6, 8] </ref>. Figs. 3-(c) and (d) show that indeed the DAR (p) processes match the first p correlations of Z a . 5.3 Critical time scales Let us examine the effect of different correlation structures (SRD or LRD) on the CTS (m fl b ). <p> Recall that all of their autocorrelation functions drop very quickly at small lags (see Figs. 3-(b) and (c)), yielding close loss behavior as we have seen from V v . This type of autocorrelations has been observed in several VBR videoconferencing traces studied in <ref> [6, 8] </ref>. We further observe that the difference between all the curves at the loss rate 10 6 is only within the order of one. <p> Unfortunately, other distributions such as heavy-tailed frame sizes pose difficulty in mathematical analysis of queue performance. For the negative binomial marginal distribution, the same conclusion was obtained by Heyman and Lakshman using a slightly different approach <ref> [8] </ref>. In general, the required bandwidth for distributions with heavier tails will be larger than for Gaussian distribution to keep the operating point unchanged (within the practical ranges of buffer size and CLR).

Reference-contexts: The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides two definitions of an LRD process used in this paper. Section 3 presents the details of two stochastic processes: Discrete-AutoRegressive process of order p [DAR (p)] <ref> [9] </ref> and Fractal-Binomial-Noise-Driven Poisson point process (FBNDP) [19]. Four VBR traffic source models, V v , Z a , S, and L, are constructed using the above processes and their marginal distributions and autocorrelations are discussed. <p> We use the lation function of the models Z a and V v . superposition of the Fractal-Binomial-Noise-Driven Poisson point process (FBNDP) [20] and DAR (1) process <ref> [9] </ref> for constructing V v and Z a . Details on how we construct these two models are given in Section 3.3. <p> In summary, Z a serves the role of a real trace that exhibits the LRD property; S [DAR (p)] captures only the short-term correlations of Z a ; and L only the long-term correlations of Z a ; see <ref> [9] </ref> and [20, chapter 6] on how DAR (p) processes capture the first p correlations of Z a . For the second claim to be valid, we must observe that L outperforms S in predicting the CLR of Z a over practical ranges of buffer sizes and CLRs. <p> As discussed in the introduction, we choose the Gaussian distribution since the marginal distribution is not the concern of this study. 3.1 DAR (p) The DAR (p) process (discrete autoregressive process of order p), constructed and analyzed by Jacobs and Lewis <ref> [9] </ref>, is a p-th order Markov chain with the physical and correlation structure of a p-th order autoregressive process; S n depends explicitly on S n1 ; : : : ; S np .

On the other hand, such characteristic is not observed in the DAR (1) model, as it is a short-range dependent model (Hurst parameter is 0.5).

A direct implication of (ii) is that the notion of effective bandwidth based on Markov models of which the BOP decays exponentially does not apply to LRD traffic (see Section 4 for detail). <p> the FBNDP and DAR (1) processes contribute equally to the mean and variance of Z a . 4 Large Deviations Theory and Critical Time Scale 4.1 Brief history on large buffer asymptotics for LRD pro cesses The first result on queueing analysis of self-similar traffic seems to appear in Norros <ref> [17] </ref> in which the popular Weibull (lower) bound on the BOP has been established using fractional Brownian Motion.

Note that ignoring g 1 (c; b; N ) yields the Large N Asymptotic given by Courcoubetis and Weber [3].

Reference-contexts: The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides two definitions of an LRD process used in this paper. Section 3 presents the details of two stochastic processes: Discrete-AutoRegressive process of order p [DAR (p)] [9] and Fractal-Binomial-Noise-Driven Poisson point process (FBNDP) <ref> [19] </ref>. Four VBR traffic source models, V v , Z a , S, and L, are constructed using the above processes and their marginal distributions and autocorrelations are discussed. Section 4 provides an overview of results from large deviations theory on the BOP of ATM multiplexers. <p> The discrete-time fractional Gaussian Noise (FGN) process has an autocorrelation function of the form (2) with g (T s ) = 1 [21], and therefore is an exact LRD process. A family of fractal stochastic point processes (FSPPs) introduced in <ref> [19, 20] </ref> also yield exact LRD processes in the sense of (2) with g (T s ) = T 2H1 s =(T 2H1 0 ). T 0 is called fractal onset time which is used to control the variance of the frame size; see [20] for detail.

Reference-contexts: The discrete-time fractional Gaussian Noise (FGN) process has an autocorrelation function of the form (2) with g (T s ) = 1 [21], and therefore is an exact LRD process. A family of fractal stochastic point processes (FSPPs) introduced in <ref> [19, 20] </ref> also yield exact LRD processes in the sense of (2) with g (T s ) = T 2H1 s =(T 2H1 0 ).

We use the lation function of the models Z a and V v . superposition of the Fractal-Binomial-Noise-Driven Poisson point process (FBNDP) <ref> [20] </ref> and DAR (1) process [9] for constructing V v and Z a . Details on how we construct these two models are given in Section 3.3. <p> In summary, Z a serves the role of a real trace that exhibits the LRD property; S [DAR (p)] captures only the short-term correlations of Z a ; and L only the long-term correlations of Z a ; see [9] and <ref> [20, chapter 6] </ref> on how DAR (p) processes capture the first p correlations of Z a . For the second claim to be valid, we must observe that L outperforms S in predicting the CLR of Z a over practical ranges of buffer sizes and CLRs. <p> Then, the process S = fS n g is called the DAR (p) process. Note that this process has p degrees of freedom, and therefore has the capability to match up to the first p autocorrelations. a 3.2 Fractal-Binomial-Noise-Driven Poisson Process (FB NDP) The FBNDP model is described in <ref> [20] </ref> in detail. Hence, only a brief description and relevant statistics of the model is provided here. <p> Then, M independent and identical fractal ON/OFF processes are added, yielding a fractal binomial process (FBN). This serves as a stationary stochastic rate function for a Poisson process; the FBNDP results <ref> [20] </ref>. This model has four parameters: ff, A, M , and R (the rate of a fractal ON/OFF process when it is ON) [20]. <p> This serves as a stationary stochastic rate function for a Poisson process; the FBNDP results <ref> [20] </ref>. This model has four parameters: ff, A, M , and R (the rate of a fractal ON/OFF process when it is ON) [20]. They determine the relevant statistics of the FBNDP as H = (ff + 1)=2 T 0 = ff (ff + 1)(2 ff) (1 ff)e + 1 R A where H is the Hurst parameter, the mean arrival rate (cells/sec), and T 0 the fractal onset time (sec). <p> For each a of Z a , we determine the parameters of the DAR (p) model (S) such that it exactly matches the first p correlations of Z a using the steps given in <ref> [20, chapter 6] </ref>. 6. The value of ff for the FBNDP component of Z a was chosen as 0:8, yielding the Hurst parameter H = 0:9. 7.

Reference-contexts: the popular effective bandwidth scheme based on simple Markovian traffic models would consequently provide a poor estimate of CLRs of LRD traffic. 4.2 Large buffer asymptotics and the Critical Time Scale for Gaussian sources Large deviations theory has served as a powerful tool for analyzing the performance of communications networks <ref> [22, references therein] </ref>. We use the Bahadur-Rao (B-R) Asymptotic of buffer overflow probability of an ATM multiplexer with N sources [16]. We use the following notations [3, 16].

Reference-contexts: While long-term correlations of LRD processes are individually small, their cumulative effect on the CLR is non-negligible [2]. 2.
