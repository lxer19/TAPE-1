Abstract: This paper treats the eigenvalue problem for a symmetric matrix which is zero except for its main diagonal and one row and column. Such problems arise in the description of radiationless transitions in isolated molecules and of oscillators vibrationally coupled with a Fermi liquid. In these applications the order n of the matrix A can be in the thousands. The purpose of this paper is to present formulas and efficient algorithms for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of such matrices.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction In this paper we will be concerned with the eigenvalue problem for a symmetric matrix which is zero except for its main diagonal and one row and column. Such problems arise in the description of radiationless transitions in isolated molecules <ref> [1] </ref> and of oscillators vibrationally coupled with a Fermi liquid [6]. In these applications the order n of the matrix A can be in the thousands. The purpose of this paper is to present formulas and efficient algorithms for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of such matrices.

Reference-contexts: This results in an algorithm which requires only O (n 2 ) computations and O (n) storage. Although the idea is conceptually simple and in 1 2 Arrowhead Matrices fact has been used to solve other eigenvalue problems of special structure <ref> [2, 3, 5] </ref>, some care must be taken to show that the computation is stable. In the next section we will give the basic properties of arrowhead matrices, and in the next we will describe how the equation ' A () = 0 may be solved.

Reference-contexts: The chief difficulty with these formulas is that we must use an approximate eigenvalue ~ i in place of the true value, which gives an approximate eigenvector ~z i . If we set k6=i Arrowhead Matrices 7 then it follows <ref> [4] </ref> that the sine of the angle between z i and ~z i satisfies sin 6 (z i ; ~z i ) ffi i k~z i k where k k is the usual Euclidean norm.

Reference-contexts: Since A is symmetric, its eigenvalues may in principle be computed by invoking any of a number of standard programs (e.g., the eispack programs <ref> [7] </ref>). However, these programs usually begin with an initial reduction of the matrix to tridiagonal form, which entails O (n 3 ) operations and O (n 2 ) storage.

Reference-contexts: Let 1 n be the eigenvalues of A. By Cauchy's interleaving theorem [9, p. 98], the eigenvalues of A interlace the eigenvalues of the matrix formed by deleting the last row and column of A, so that 1 d 1 2 d n1 n : (2:2) By Gerschgorin's theorem <ref> [8, p. 302] </ref>, d 0 &lt; 1 and n &lt; d n . These inequalities immediately imply the statements about multiple eigenvalues. <p> This result shows that whatever we compute for '(), it is the same value we would have obtained by performing exact calculations with a slightly perturbed 6 Arrowhead Matrices matrix ~ A = A + H. Now it can be shown <ref> [8, p. 315] </ref> that such a perturbation can move the eigenvalues of A by no more than kHk 1 = max X jh ij j: Since for our problem kHk 1 1:06n (jpj + jj + i def the eigenvalues ~ i of A + H satisfy j ~ i i

Reference-contexts: We will call such an arrowhead matrix irreducible. The basic results on the eigenvalues of arrowhead matrices are contained in the following theorem due to Wilkinson <ref> [9, pp. 94 ff.] </ref>. Here we give a slightly different proof that contains results needed to derive our algorithm. Theorem 2.1. Let A be an ordered, irreducible arrowhead matrix of the form (1.1). <p> Let 1 n be the eigenvalues of A. By Cauchy's interleaving theorem <ref> [9, p. 98] </ref>, the eigenvalues of A interlace the eigenvalues of the matrix formed by deleting the last row and column of A, so that 1 d 1 2 d n1 n : (2:2) By Gerschgorin's theorem [8, p. 302], d 0 &lt; 1 and n &lt; d n .
