Abstract: The World-Wide-Web is less agent-friendly than we might hope. Most information on the Web is presented in loosely structured natural language text with no agent-readable semantics. HTML annotations structure the display of Web pages, but provide virtually no insight into their content. Thus, the designers of intelligent Web agents need to address the following questions: (1) To what extent can an agent understand information published at Web sites? (2) Is the agent's understanding sufficient to provide genuinely useful assistance to users? (3) Is site-specific hand-coding necessary, or can the agent automatically extract information from unfamiliar Web sites? (4) What as pects of the Web facilitate this competence? In this paper we investigate these issues with a case study using ShopBot, a fully-implemented, domain-independent comparison-shopping agent. Given the home pages of several online stores, ShopBot autonomously learns how to shop at those vendors. After learning, it is able to speedily visit over a dozen software and CD vendors, extract product information, and summarize the results for the user. Preliminary studies show that ShopBot enables users to both find superior prices and substantially reduce Web shopping time.

Reference-contexts: Since these pages are created by a (deterministic) program, they have a uniform format. The bodies of success pages typically contain logi-cal lines with a wide variety of abstract formats, only one of which corresponds to product descriptions. (See <ref> (Doorenbos, Etzioni, & Weld 1996) </ref> for some examples.) The learner uses a heuristic ranking process to choose which format is most likely to be the one the store uses for product descriptions.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In recent years, AI researchers have created several prototype software agents that help users with email and netnews filtering (Maes & Kozierok 1993), Web browsing (Armstrong et al. 1995; Lieberman 1995), meeting scheduling (Dent et al. 1992; Mitchell et al. 1994; Maes 1994), and internet-related tasks <ref> (Etzioni & Weld 1994) </ref>. Increasingly, the information such agents need to access is available on the World-Wide Web. Unfortunately, the Web is less agent-friendly than we might hope. Although Web pages are written in HTML, this language only defines how information is to be displayed, not what it means. <p> ShopBot is unique in its ability to learn to extract information from the semi-structured text published by Web vendors. Much of the related agent work requires structured information of the sort found in a relational database (e.g., (Levy, Srivastava, & Kirk 1995; Arens et al. 1993)). The Internet Softbot <ref> (Etzioni & Weld 1994) </ref> is also able to extract information from the rigidly formatted output of UNIX commands such as ls and Internet services such as netfind.

Reference-contexts: We chose the CD domain, first used by the hand-crafted agent BargainFinder <ref> (Krulwich 1996) </ref>, to demonstrate the versatility and scope of ShopBot's architecture. With one day's work on describing the CD domain, we were able to get ShopBot to shop successfully at four CD stores.

Reference-contexts: In contrast with ShopBot, virtually all learning software agents (e.g., (Maes & Kozierok 1993; Maes 1994; Dent et al. 1992; Knoblock & Levy 1995)) learn about their user's interests, instead of learning about the external resources they access. The key exception is the Internet Learning Agent, ILA <ref> (Perkowitz et al. 1996) </ref>. ILA learns to understand external information sources by explaining their output in terms of internal categories. ILA learns by querying an information source with familiar objects and analyzing the relationship of output tokens to the query.
