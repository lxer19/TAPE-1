Abstract: Hybrid systems are continuous variable, continuous time systems with a phased operation. We present the hybrid automaton model and introduce the problems of control and verification. We describe the information structure of a hybrid system in terms of its observation and control spaces, observation map, control strategy, and state evolution. For the important case of symbolic observations and controls|i.e., of finite observation and control spaces|we develop the notions of state space refinement and equivalence partitioning. We review from the literature different information structure setups for control and verification of hybrid systems.

Reference-contexts: However, there are subclasses of hybrid systems that are decidable|those that yield a finite equivalence partition. We consider three such subclasses, Timer Re gion Automata, Suspension Automata, and Rectangular Automata. Timer region automata described by Alur, Courcou-betis, and Dill <ref> [1] </ref> constitute a decidable subclass of hybrid systems. They are obtained by imposing the following constraints on the hybrid automaton model. 1.

Reference-contexts: To show this, it is demonstrated that the discrete event traces in L b H induce a finite equivalence partition of the continuous state space R n . McManis and Varaiya <ref> [8] </ref> have extended the timer region automaton model to permit clock variables with rates 0 or 1, i.e., _x i = 0 or _x i = 1. The general class of such systems is undecidable.

Reference-contexts: Examples Now we consider three discrete time setups from the literature. The first illustrates, as above, the case of finite observation and control spaces, the second il lustrates countable observation space and continuous control space, and the third illustrates continuous observation space and finite control space. Ramadge <ref> [11] </ref> considers a discrete time system with quantized state observation described by X Y as above, and plant dynamics given as x (k + 1) = f a (x (k)); a 2 U; with U finite.
