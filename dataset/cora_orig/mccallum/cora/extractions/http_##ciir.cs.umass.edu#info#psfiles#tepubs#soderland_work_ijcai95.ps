Abstract: Domain-specific text analysis requires a dictionary of linguistic patterns that identify references to relevant information in a text. This paper describes CRYSTAL, a fully automated tool that induces such a dictionary of text extraction rules. We discuss some key issues in developing an automatic dictionary induction system, using CRYSTAL as a concrete example. CRYSTAL derives text extraction rules from training instances and generalizes each rule as far as possible, testing the accuracy of each proposed rule on the training corpus. An error tolerance parameter allows CRYSTAL to manipulate a trade-off between recall and precision. We discuss issues involved with creating training data, defining a domain ontology, and allowing a flexible and expressive representation while designing a search control mecha nism that avoids intractability.

Reference-contexts: Early in CRYSTAL's development, we created our own ad hoc semantic hierarchy and semantic lexicon with some assistance from our domain expert. This was replaced by one derived from the Unified Medical Language Systems (UMLS) on-line medical MetaThesaurus and Semantic Network <ref> [ Lindberg et al., 1993 ] </ref> . UMLS is under developement by the National Library of Medicine and represents a knowledge source far superior to our ad hoc efforts, but is itself under development and is still weak in coverage of terms for clinical findings.

Reference-contexts: In another case the important context may be a sequence of exact words in the subject buffer and the semantic class of the direct object. CRYSTAL has a more expressive representation than other published systems that induce text extraction rules. PALKA <ref> [ Moldovan and Kim, 1992; Moldovan et al., 1993 ] </ref> includes an induction step similar to CRYSTAL's. PALKA constructs an initial "Frame-Phrasal pattern structure" (FP-structure) from each example clause that contains relevant information. The FP-structure constrains the root form of the verb, but allows no other exact word constraints.

Reference-contexts: Researchers at UMass spent about 1500 hours creating a dictionary of CN definitions for the ARPA-sponsored 1991 MUC-3 evaluation, whose domain was Latin American terrorism. The following year a partially automated dictionary construction tool, AutoSlog <ref> [ Riloff, 1993 ] </ref> , was developed. AutoSlog automatically created a set of proposed CN definitions which required less than 8 hours of review by a "human in the loop". The AutoSlog CN dictionary acheived 98% of the performance of the hand-crafted dictionary. <p> The FP-structure constrains the root form of the verb, but allows no other exact word constraints. PALKA learns semantic constraints on each noun group (e.g. subject, direct object) in the clause, and on prepositional phrases containing relevant information. Other prepositional phrases are omitted from the FP-structure. AutoSlog <ref> [ Riloff, 1993 ] </ref> , the precursor of CRYSTAL, also generates CN definitions from motivating instances in the text. AutoSlog uses heuristics to select certain exact words from an instance as "trigger words". Semantic constraints on the extracted buffer are set in advance by the user rather than learned.
