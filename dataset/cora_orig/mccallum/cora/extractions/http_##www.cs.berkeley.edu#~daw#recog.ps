Title: A Programmable Plaintext Recognizer  
Author: David A. Wagner Steven M. Bellovin 
Address: Princeton, NJ Murray Hill, NJ  
Affiliation: Princeton University AT&T Bell Laboratories  
Abstract: Other researchers have studied the feasibility of a brute force attack on DES using several known plaintexts. In practice, known plain-text/ciphertext pairs may not be readily available, but statistical information about similar plaintexts is much more easily aquired. Accordingly, we design a statistical plaintext recognizer suitable for use in a ciphertext-only key search machine. Software simulations indicate that this design gives a powerful attack on the encryption of low-entropy data.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Ever since the Data Encryption Standard (DES) was announced <ref> [1] </ref>, researchers have worried about its relatively short key size. Its cryptographic strength notwithstanding, 56 bits seemed vulnerable to exhaustive search.
Reference: 2. <author> Whitfield Diffie and Martin E. Hellman. </author> <title> Exhaustive cryptanalysis of the NBS data encryption standard. </title> <journal> Computer, </journal> <volume> 10(6) </volume> <pages> 74-84, </pages> <month> June </month> <year> 1977. </year>
Reference-contexts: Its cryptographic strength notwithstanding, 56 bits seemed vulnerable to exhaustive search. Diffie and Hellman quickly concluded that a highly parallel custom-designed machine could indeed mount a successful brute force attack on DES with a price tag of about $20 million <ref> [2] </ref>, though that estimate was disputed by some. <p> This leaves single character, digraph, and tri-graph frequency statistics as a natural starting point. Diffie and Hellman proposed a very simple decision strategy: if the high bit of all 8 bytes in the plaintext block is zero, save the key; otherwise, discard it <ref> [2] </ref>. This strategy has the advantage of being simple and quick. Unfortunately, this test only works for 7 bit text; we would like to handle other types of data, if possible.

On the other hand, the only other known attacks on DES, linear cryptanalysis [7] and differential cryptanalysis [8], require at least 2 43 known plaintexts. This is simply too much data to compare favorably to brute force; thus, exhaustive key search is currently the most economical attack known.

Reference-contexts: Deliberately and carefully hiding the IV seems like a useful technique for achieving extra security with OFB mode. Since both parties must know the hidden IV, it essentially serves as 64 more bits of "key." However, the operational characteristics of OFB mode render it unsuitable for many applications <ref> [17] </ref>. 5 Hardware Issues Our design goal is to maintain a search rate of 50 million decryptions per second with a cost roughly comparable to that of Wiener's machine.

Reference-contexts: Triple DES is a good choice: van Oorschot and Wiener estimate that triple DES with two keys is about 10 13 times stronger than single DES, and the three-key version is even better <ref> [18] </ref>. IDEA is another possibility, though systems which use single DES are more easily converted to triple DES.
