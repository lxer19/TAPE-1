Abstract: Attempts at discourse processing of spontaneously spoken dialogue face several difficulties: multiple hypotheses that result from the parser's attempts to make sense of the output from the speech rec-ognizer, ambiguity that results from segmentation of multi-sentence utterances, and cumulative error errors in the discourse context which cause further errors when subsequent sentences are processed. In this paper we will describe our robust parsers, our procedures for segmenting long utterances, and two approaches to discourse processing that attempt to deal with ambiguity and cumulative error.

Reference-contexts: Discourse Processing The discourse processing module in Janus disambiguates the speech act of each SDU, updates a dynamic memory of schedules, and incorporates the SDU into discourse context. We have experimented with two approaches to discourse processing: a plan inference system (based on work by Lambert <ref> [1] </ref>) and a finite state processor Unsegmented Speech Recognition: (%noise% si1 mira toda la man5ana estoy disponible %noise% %noise% y tambie1n el fin de semana si podri1a hacer mejor un di1a fin de semana porque justo el once no puedo me es imposible va a poder fin de semana) Pre-broken Speech

Reference-contexts: An example of an ILT is shown in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: The speech act is recognized in the course of determining how the inference chain attaches to the plan tree. The finite state machine (FSM) discourse processor <ref> [5] </ref> describes representative sequences of speech acts in the scheduling domain. It is used to record the standard dialogue flow and to check whether the predicted speech act follows idealized dialogue act sequences. The states in the FSM represent speech acts in the domain.

Reference-contexts: The finite state approach provides a fast and efficient alternative to the more time-consuming plan-based approach. Currently, the two discourse processors are used separately. We intend to combine these two approaches with a layered architecture, similar to the one proposed for Verbmobil <ref> [6] </ref>, in which the finite state machine would constitute a lower layer providing an efficient way of recognizing speech acts, while the plan-based discourse processor, at a higher layer, would be used to handle more knowledge-intensive processes, such as recognizing doubt or clarification sub-dialogues and robust ellipsis resolution.

Reference-contexts: The performance of each approach in assigning speech acts is presented in Section 4.2. The plan-based discourse processor <ref> [7] </ref> takes as its input the best parse returned by the parser. The discourse context is represented as a plan tree. The main task of the discourse processor is to relate the input to the context, or the plan tree.

Reference-contexts: The two modules can run separately or can be combined to gain the strengths of both. The GLR module is composed of the GLR* parser [2][3], the LA-Morph morphological analyzer and the GenKit generator. The GLR* parser is based on Tomita's Generalized LR parsing algorithm <ref> [8] </ref>. GLR* skips parts of the utterance that it cannot incorporate into a well-formed sentence structure. Thus, it is well-suited to domains in which non-grammaticality is common. The parser conducts a search for the maximal subset of the original input that is covered by the grammar.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction In this paper we describe how the JANUS <ref> [10] </ref> multi-lingual speech-to-speech translation system addresses problems that arise in discourse processing of spontaneous speech. The analysis of spoken dialogues requires discourse processors that can deal with ambiguity and cumulative error errors in the discourse context which cause further errors when subsequent sentences are processed.
