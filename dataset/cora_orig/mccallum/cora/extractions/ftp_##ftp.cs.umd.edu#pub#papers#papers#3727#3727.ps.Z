Abstract: The numerical solution of the Helmholtz equation subject to nonlocal radiation boundary conditions is studied. The specific problem is the propagation of hydroacoustic waves in a two-dimensional curvilinear duct. The problem is discretized with a second-order accurate finite-difference method, resulting in a linear system of equations. To solve the system of equations, a preconditioned Krylov subspace method is employed. The preconditioner is based on fast transforms, and yields a direct fast Helmholtz solver for rectangular domains. Numerical experiments for curved ducts demonstrate that the rate of convergence is high. Compared with band Gaussian elimination the preconditioned iterative method shows a significant gain in both storage requirement and arithmetic complexity.

In all experiments, the systems of equations have been solved using the GMRES (`) method combined with the preconditioner defined in x3. The orthogonal grid is generated by a code based on the method described in <ref> [Abra91] </ref>. The implementations are made in Fortran 90, utilizing 64 bit precision for the grid generation, and 32 bit precision for the iterative method and the preconditioner.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction. The Helmholtz equation arises in many physical applications, e.g., scattering problems in electromagnetics and acoustics [Ernst94], <ref> [AbKr94] </ref>. In realistic applications, a wide range of wavenumbers is often of interest. For a finite element (or finite-difference) discretization of the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation, it is necessary that the number of grid points grows faster than quadratically in the wavenumber in order to maintain a given accuracy [BaGoTu85a], [IhlBa97]. <p> Thus, for high wavenumbers, the discretized Helmholtz equation "leads to a huge linear system of equations" <ref> [AbKr94] </ref>. Due to the large bandwidth, the storage requirement renders Gaussian elimination prohibitive. To handle high wavenumbers and large domains for the Helmholtz equation in duct acoustics, Abrahamsson and Kreiss [AbKr94] devised a special iteration technique related to separation of variables. <p> Thus, for high wavenumbers, the discretized Helmholtz equation "leads to a huge linear system of equations" <ref> [AbKr94] </ref>.

To handle high wavenumbers and large domains for the Helmholtz equation in duct acoustics, Abrahamsson and Kreiss [AbKr94] devised a special iteration technique related to separation of variables. However, the effectiveness of the method relies on the degree of separability of the problem. Another way to address the computational difficulties for the discretized Helmholtz equation is to design iterative methods. <p> Boundary conditions based on DtN maps require the boundary in question to be a separable coordinate surface. Moreover, for the radiation condition in [FixMa78], it is implicitly assumed that the duct could be extended beyond the artificial boundary by parallel straight walls. This is a so-called anechoical termination <ref> [AbKr94] </ref>. Since the wavenumber is independent of ~ 2 , the above prerequisites are fulfilled by requiring the duct to be flat only in an infinitesimal neighborhood of x 2 = d 2 and x 2 = 0. In the present application, the wavenumber is actually a constant.

Reference-contexts: The spectrum of M 1 B for d 2 = 300; d ` = 50; d r = 20; and f = 25: The preconditioned spectrum exhibits a high degree of clustering around one, which is favorable for Krylov subspace methods [Axel94], <ref> [Axel88] </ref>. Since the preconditioner coincides with the discretization matrix for the model problem in a duct with a flat bottom, it is to be expected that the rate of convergence will be affected by the geometry.

Reference-contexts: We construct a precon-ditioner that preserves the block structure of B, thus exploiting sparsity. Moreover, it should be possible to form and apply the preconditioner at low arithmetic costs. To meet these demands, we use a preconditioner [Otto96] based on fast trigonometric transforms [VLoan92], <ref> [BaSw91] </ref>. The main idea in the design is to approximate the matrix B with a preconditioner having the same block structure, and where all the blocks have the same prescribed eigenvectors. <p> By permuting the unknowns, we get m 1 independent tridiagonal systems of order m 2 . Steps 1 and 3 consist of m 2 sine transforms-II and inverse sine transforms-II of length m 1 . We can utilize fast Fourier transform methods <ref> [BaSw91] </ref> for computing these transforms [Otto96]. 4. Computational issues. 4.1. Resolution. Since the solutions to the Helmholtz equation are waves, it is evident that the grid size h must follow the wavenumber in order to achieve a given accuracy.

Reference-contexts: In order to be a viable method, it should exploit the sparsity of the discretization matrix in an efficient way, converge rapidly, and be competitive with Gaussian elimination in regard to the total arithmetic complexity. Our approach is to apply a preconditioned Krylov subspace method <ref> [FrGoNa92] </ref> directly to the discretized equations. Typically and especially for high wavenumbers, the discretization matrix is large, complex, indefinite, and ill-conditioned. As a result, standard preconditioning techniques like diagonal scaling and incomplete LU decomposition are likely to do poorly.

Reference-contexts: Thus, an appropriate way to truncate the series in (6) is to retain only the terms with mode indices m ` . The situation is somewhat different for a purely exterior Helmholtz problem, where an appropriate truncation of DtN maps is a more delicate matter <ref> [GrKe95] </ref>. The A m -terms in (6) correspond to rightgoing waves, and the B m -terms correspond to leftgoing waves. In our model we have a source at the left boundary.

In fact, for a duct with a flat bottom, all the blocks in B would be diagonalized by Q, yielding M = B <ref> [Otto96] </ref>. Hence, the operator M 1 is a direct fast Helmholtz solver for rectangular domains. For a duct with a curved bottom, blocks corresponding to inner grid lines will not be completely diagonalized. However, when the domain is moderately curved, the preconditioner presumably acts like a viable convergence accelerator. <p> For the Dirichlet-Dirichlet and Neumann-Neumann boundary conditions discussed in x2.4, the eigenvector matrices would rather be chosen as those associated with the sine and cosine transforms, respectively. The preconditioners thus arising would also yield direct fast solvers for rectangular domains, see <ref> [Otto96] </ref>. For each iteration, the computation x = M 1 y has to be performed. <p> By permuting the unknowns, we get m 1 independent tridiagonal systems of order m 2 . Steps 1 and 3 consist of m 2 sine transforms-II and inverse sine transforms-II of length m 1 .

The arithmetic work can be divided into initialization and iteration. The initial part consists of forming <ref> [Otto96] </ref> the preconditioner and factorizing the tridiagonal systems at a cost of a pf = 20 ^m m 1 log 2 ^m + 139, where ^m = 2 dlog 2 (2m 1 +1)e+1 .
