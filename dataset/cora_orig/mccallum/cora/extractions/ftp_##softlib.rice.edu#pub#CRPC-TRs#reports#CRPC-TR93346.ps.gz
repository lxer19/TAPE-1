Title: ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MIXED METHODS AS NONCONFORMING METHODS FOR SECOND ORDER ELLIPTIC PROBLEMS  
Author: TODD ARBOGAST and ZHANGXIN CHEN 
Abstract: In this paper we show that mixed finite element methods for a fairly general second order elliptic problem with variable coefficients can be given a non-mixed formulation. (Lower order terms are treated, so our results apply also to parabolic equations.) We define an approximation method by incorporating some projection operators within a standard Galerkin method, which we call a projection finite element method. It is shown that for a given mixed method, if the projection method's finite element space M h satisfies three conditions, then the two approximation methods are equivalent. These three conditions can be simplified for a single element in the case of mixed spaces possessing the usual vector projection operator. We then construct appropriate nonconforming spaces M h for the known triangular and rectangular elements. The lowest-order Raviart-Thomas mixed solution on rectangular finite elements in IR 2 and IR 3 , on simplices, or on prisms, is then implemented as a nonconforming method modified in a simple and computationally trivial manner. This new nonconforming solution is actually equivalent to a postprocessed version of the mixed solution. A rearrangement of the computation of the mixed method solution through this equivalence allows us to design simple and optimal order multigrid methods for the solution of the linear system. 1. Introduction. We consider the following elliptic problem for u on the bounded

It is a Galerkin method with the addition of some special projection operators, and hence we will call it a projection finite element method. <p> Our nonconforming spaces perhaps illuminate some of the relationships between these mixed spaces. We point out that projection finite element spaces are not necessarily unique, since two such spaces are known for the lowest order Raviart-Thomas space over triangles: the one defined by Arnold and Brezzi <ref> [1] </ref> uses cubic "bubble functions" while the one defined by Chen [11] uses quadratic bubble functions. Then, for several sections, we restrict our attention to the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas mixed method on rectangles. In Section 6, our general projection space is shown to have a nice structure. <p> The constraint V h V says that the normal components of the members of V h are continuous across the interior boundaries in @E h . Following <ref> [1] </ref>, we relax this constraint on V h by defining ~ V h = fv 2 L 2 () : vj E 2 V h (E) for each E 2 E h g: We then need to introduce Lagrange multipliers to enforce the required continuity on ~ V h , so <p> Equivalent spaces for triangular mixed methods. We are now in a position to construct some nonconforming spaces that give rise to projection finite element methods that are equivalent to standard mixed methods. We begin by generalizing the results of Arnold and Brezzi <ref> [1] </ref> to the known triangular methods. These mixed spaces satisfy the conditions of Theorem 4, so it remains only to define over a triangle T a space M h (T ) of the correct dimension and prove the unisolvence of (DF). <p> The Raviart-Thomas spaces on triangles. These spaces [21] are defined for each k 0 by V k 2 W k L k First let us recall what is already known for the lowest order space. An M h (of dimension 4) for this space is <ref> [1] </ref>, [11] M h (T ) = P 1 (T ) B h (T ); where we define B h (T ) to be the span of either the P 3 -bubble function, fi 3 which vanishes on each edge, or the P 2 -bubble function, fi 2 1 (x; y) <p> Now (DF1) shows that ( ^ ` 1 ^ ` 2 ^ ` 3 w; w) T = 0, which finally gives that ~ = 0. We remark that if k is even, we obtain the nonconforming method of Arnold and Brezzi <ref> [1] </ref>. 4.2.

For simplicity, assume that R = <ref> [1; 1] </ref> n . We will make use of the Legendre polynomials p m (x i ) of degree m defined on the interval [1; 1]. <p> Finally, results analogous to those in Section 8 are valid. 24 TODD ARBOGAST AND ZHANGXIN CHEN 11.

Reference-contexts: Marini [18] noted that the computational cost of this modification is almost nil, if a is a piecewise constant scalar. This equivalence has been exploited to obtain optimal L 1 ()-error estimates for the mixed method [16]. Recently, Brenner <ref> [4] </ref> has used the equivalence to define and analyze an optimally convergent multigrid method. Chen [9], [11] has derived some nonconforming methods that are equivalent to certain lower dimensional mixed methods, and exploited superconvergence properties to obtain a better approximation to the scalar variable. <p> Alternatively, we may view the nonconforming solution as an approximation to u obtained by a special postprocessing of the mixed solution. This equivalence is exploited in Section 8 to derive optimal order multigrid algorithms for the mixed and nonconforming methods. Unlike the multigrid algorithm imposed in <ref> [4] </ref> for the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas mixed triangular finite element method, our multigrid algorithms are based on standard nonconforming finite element methods. <p> It is well-known that natural injection operators do not work for nonnested finite element spaces. Thus, we need to introduce special intergrid transfer operators. Following <ref> [4] </ref>, we define the coarse-to-fine intergrid transfer operators I k k1 : N k1 ! N k as follows. <p> (g m ; I k From (6.10), the multigrid approximate solution b k to k is defined in R 2 E k by k rbz k + fl R (f k d k P W k bz k )j R rfi R (x; y) : The standard argument [2], [3], <ref> [4] </ref> for the convergence analysis of the multigrid algorithm (8.5) applies here if we prove that I k k1 is bounded and reduces to the natural injection on continuous bilinear functions. <p> MIXED METHODS AS NONCONFORMING METHODS 21 Since b k belongs to b V k = fv : vj R = (a 1 R x; a 3 R y); a i but not necessarily to V k , following <ref> [4] </ref>, we introduce the averaging operator fl k : b V k !

Let e be an edge of R 2 E k and n e be a unit outer normal to e. <p> In the case of equilateral sim-plices, this can be seen as before since then rB h (E) V h (E) and the projection operator ~ P V h in (10.3) can be removed. In the general case the convergence result can be shown using the ideas given in <ref> [4] </ref> (that is, we show that k ~ P V h r~k and kr~k are equivalent norms for ~ 2 N h , and we use the interpolant of u into N h as an intermediary).

Reference-contexts: In particular, the lowest order Raviart-Thomas space defined over triangles <ref> [21] </ref> is equivalent to a simple modification of the P 1 -nonconforming Galerkin method. This nonconforming method yields a symmetric and positive definite problem (i.e., a minimization problem); whereas, the mixed formulation is a saddle point problem. <p> In Sections 4 and 5, we use this general theory to define equivalent projection methods for various mixed methods for the problem (1.3). We treat the mixed spaces of Raviart and Thomas <ref> [21] </ref>, Nedelec [19], Brezzi, Douglas, and Marini [8], Brezzi, Douglas, Duran, and Fortin [6], and Brezzi, Douglas, Fortin, and Marini [7] defined over triangles or rectangular parallelepipeds in IR 2 and IR 3 .

This space is finite dimensional and defined locally on each element E 2 E h , so let V h (E) = V h j E and W h (E) = W h j E . <p> Finally, for any edge e, let ~ P k (e) denote the L 2 (e)-orthogonal complement of P k (e) in P k1 (e) (i.e., the span of the Legendre polynomials of exact degree k). 4.1.
