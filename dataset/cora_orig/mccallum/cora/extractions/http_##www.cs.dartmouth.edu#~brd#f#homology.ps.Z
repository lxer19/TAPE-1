Title: On Computing the Homology Type of a Triangulation  
Author: David Renpan Chang Bruce Randall Donald 
Date: March 9, 1994  
Affiliation: Computer Science Department, Cornell University  
Abstract: We analyze an algorithm for computing the homology type of a triangulation. By triangulation we mean a finite simplicial complex; its homology type is given by its homology groups (with integer coefficients). The algorithm could be used in computer-aided design to tell whether two finite-element meshes or Bezier-spline surfaces are of the same "topological type," and whether they can be embedded in R 3 . Homology computation is a purely combinatorial problem of considerable intrinsic interest. While the worst-case bounds we obtain for this algorithm are poor, we argue that many triangulations (in general) and virtually all triangulations in design are very "sparse," in a sense we make precise. We formalize this sparseness measure, and perform a probabilistic analysis of the sparse case to show that the expected running time of the algorithm is roughly quadratic in the geometric complexity (number of simplices) and linear in the dimension. fl This paper describes research done in the Robotics and Vision Laboratory at Cornell University.

Reference-contexts: Hence, one column swap (or row swap) during a checking step of a pre-reduction will still give us an essentially uniform remaining matrix. Moreover, by the theorem on the convergence of measures (stated below as theorem 32) in probability theory (see <ref> [Fel] </ref>), we can perform expectation and variance computation on our "almost" uniform matrices as if we are dealing with uniform matrices. Theorem 32 (Convergence of Measures) Let X and Y be two random variables such that Y has uniform distribution.

Reference-contexts: In computer-aided design (CAD), many geometric designs are triangulations. For example, finite-element methods use 2D and 3D triangulations of solids, called finite-element meshes. Triangular parametric surfaces such as rational Bezier surfaces are widely used in geometric modeling systems <ref> [War] </ref>. A collection of these objects is, topologically, a triangulation (a 3D finite-element tetrahe-dralization is simply a 3D triangulation). Furthermore, algorithms exist for triangulating polygons and tetrahedra (eg, [Che]); the problem of triangulating algebraic varieties has been studied by Hironaka, McCallum and others.
