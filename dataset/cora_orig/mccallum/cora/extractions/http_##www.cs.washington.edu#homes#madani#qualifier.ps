Title: Fast Approximate Matching in Restriction Site Mapping  
Author: Omid Madani 
Date: November 14, 1995  
Abstract: This paper presents a trie data structure for fast approximate matching of DNA fragments in a large scale restriction mapping project. It analyzes several parameters that affect the performance of the data structure and briefly explores strategies on how it might be used and how to proceed in the initial stages of potential algorithms for mapping. The paper then reports on experimental results and concludes with future directions.

Reference-contexts: Higher d values simply raise the expected number of intervals and fragments that the algorithm examines before potential rejection of a candidate clone. Briefly, the trie algorithm maps each clone to a vector of nonnegative numbers and builds a trie <ref> [Fre60] </ref>, out of the vectors. For each clone, the algorithm filters out candidate clones exceeding the threshold d through the use of the trie, thereby avoiding most direct clone-clone comparisons.

Extensions to their algorithms to support error is possible 2 and comparisons may be fruitful. Software for restriction site mapping exists and many aspects of the problem have been already studied (see [GH91] and [BGG90] for example). <p> In this case, the trie would be built on the two end segments of each island (for single clones there would only be one end segment). On the algorithmic side, a comparison with the approach in <ref> [KWZ95] </ref> may prove fruitful. We may also consider applying the basic ideas of the algorithm to other domains. 10 Summary and Conclusions The trie algorithm developed here speeds up the matching phase considerably given sufficiently high matching criteria.

Reference-contexts: The coverage should be high enough so that with high probability, every position on the DNA is sampled by at least one clone, i.e. no gaps be present in the clone coverage. One of the results by Lander and Waterman <ref> [LW88] </ref> states that if the DNA molecule is sampled uniformly, then the expected fraction of the DNA not covered by any clone is e C . The average length of a clone and the cut rate of the enzymes determines the map resolution, i.e. the average distance between the markers. <p> For further information on mathematical models of mapping projects and surveys of problems arising in computational molecular biology, see <ref> [LW88] </ref>, [Kar93] and [PW95]. 2 Related Work Our problem of fast approximate matching of clones falls under the general areas of approximate matching and clustering, and is closely related to areas such as multidimensional searching and 1 We report the timing results from experiments carried out on an SGI Indy4600. 3 <p> The first is due Lander and Waterman <ref> [LW88] </ref>. The second version, developed here, should be tighter. The event probabilities derived here define a decision rule on whether the 12 fingerprints of the query and candidate clones provide sufficient evidence of overlap (see the next section). <p> For simplicity, if we assume that min = 0 and max ! 1, then the expression simplifies to 2* 4* 2 or approximately * 2 . In <ref> [LW88] </ref> the above probability is used to get the expected number of overlapping pair of fragments between two clones of n fragments each. Viewing fragments in each clone as vertices, we see n 2 possible overlaps or edges between the two groups of vertices.
