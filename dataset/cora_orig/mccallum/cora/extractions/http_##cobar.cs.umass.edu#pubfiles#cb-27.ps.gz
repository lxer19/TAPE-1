Title: Finding Legally Relevant Passages in Case Opinions.

Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid case-based reasoning (CBR) and information retrieval (IR) system, called SPIRE, that locates passages likely to contain information about legally relevant features of cases found in full-text court opinions. SPIRE uses an example base of excerpts from past opinions to form queries, which are run by the INQUERY IR text retrieval engine on individual case opinions. These opinions can be those found by SPIRE in a prior stage of processing, which also employs a hybrid CBR-IR approach to retrieve relevant texts from large document corpora. (This aspect of SPIRE was reported on at ICAIL95.) We present an overview of SPIRE, run through an extended example, and give results comparing SPIRE's with human performance.

Reference-contexts: Past work in our lab has addressed several aspects of this legal information processing sequence, including (adversarial) precedent-based reasoning and argumentation in both common law <ref> [Ash90, RA87] </ref> and statutory domains [RS91], perusal and harvesting of information from symbolically represented legal information [RSF94, RSF96], and preparation of stereotypical memos and reports [RDRS93]. <p> In the usual CBR fashion, SPIRE determines the similarity of each known case to the new problem and represents the results of this analysis in a standard claim lattice <ref> [Ash90] </ref>. The most relevant cases from this analysis|typically the cases in the top two layers of the claim lattice|are then used to "prime the pump" of INQUERY's relevance feedback module. This set of "best cases" is called the relevance feedback case-knowledge-base or RF-CKB [RD95, RD96].

Reference-contexts: Recently, we have considered the use of case-based reasoning (CBR) to drive traditional full-text information retrieval (IR) engines, such as INQUERY <ref> [CCH92] </ref>, to retrieve case opinions from large document corpora [RD95, DR95]. In this paper, we concentrate on the process of locating within individual opinions those passages likely to contain information about legally relevant aspects of a case. The opinions are presented as ordinary text. <p> In both stages, SPIRE uses the cases as the basis for generating queries, which are then run by INQUERY <ref> [CCH92] </ref> in the usual way. In the first stage, the query is run on the text collection; in the second stage, it is run on individual documents. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: Among the set of base queries, the first two generally outperformed the second two. This indicates that phrases were detrimental, rather than beneficial in our application. This is surprising since phrases typically increase retrieval performance <ref> [CTL91] </ref>. Closer examination of the SPIRE-generated phrases offers an explanation for this. In situations where phrases have proved beneficial, (for full-document retrieval), the automatically generated phrases were were noun phrases.

Reference-contexts: Example excerpts are given in the next section. SPIRE gathers the existing excerpts for a feature and generates a new query to be run on individual documents. There are numerous techniques for transforming the excerpts into passage retrieval queries. (A fuller discussion of this can be found in <ref> [Dan97] </ref>.) SPIRE presents the query along with a specified document to the IR engine which, in turn, retrieves the top ranked passages for presentation to the user or possibly to an information extraction system. <p> The terms were then given weights based on the Kwok scheme, which ranks terms in order of perceived importance. We investigated five types of Kwok-derived queries but found results with them to be not as strong as with the set of base queries. (See <ref> [Dan97] </ref> for details.) We also investigated what we called semi-random queries. To create these, SPIRE randomly selected either one-half or one-third of the available query terms from the excerpt case-base. <p> These queries addressed our concern that there might be too many terms available, which might allow too many passages to receive high belief scores. Again, the results were not as good as with the base queries, and details can be found in <ref> [Dan97] </ref>. To provide another point of comparison, we also had a human expert, familiar with both the domain and IN-QUERY query operators, create a set of queries. These manual queries were refined over time and use many more types of operators than the SPIRE-generated queries.

(A detailed description of this first stage can be found in <ref> [DR95, RD96] </ref>.) In the second stage, SPIRE locates germane passages within each of the texts retrieved in stage one. In this stage SPIRE locates passages within a document rather than documents within a collection. Again SPIRE uses a hybrid CBR-IR approach.

Reference-contexts: The fifth type of query was created by taking a bag of words type query and removing duplicate words. We also tried another set of queries based on a weighting scheme suggested by Kwok <ref> [Kwo96] </ref>. To create these queries, SPIRE generated an initial query that included all the words found in all the excerpts. The terms were then given weights based on the Kwok scheme, which ranks terms in order of perceived importance.

INQUERY automatically generates a query by selecting and weighting terms or pairs of terms from within this set.
