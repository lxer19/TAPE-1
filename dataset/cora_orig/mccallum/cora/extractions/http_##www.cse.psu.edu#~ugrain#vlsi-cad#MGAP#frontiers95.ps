Members of the family are variegated according to processor cell architecture, size of the 2-D array, and cycle time.

Reference-contexts: Other recent massively parallel array architectures include the MPP, DAP, GAPP, etc. <ref> [5] </ref>. The MGAP family is more flexible than these systems, and careful attention was paid to balancing processing and memory needs. Among other things, this has resulted in small on-chip memories. system | MGAP-1.

Reference-contexts: Flexibility comes from the fact that the processors can be configured to take inputs from different neighbors through their configuration registers and the function multiplexers can be programmed to perform different functions depending on their inputs <ref> [6] </ref>. Only those DPs which have their enable register set will perform the instruction issued. To integrate more digit processors and a larger local memory in the limited silicon area, two major optimization methods were used. The first is to take advantage of recent VLSI technology developments.

Reference-contexts: This is a disadvantage of using off-the-shelf parts in a high performance design. However, this disadvantage is less severe than those of using a full-custom controller: longer design times, lack of flexibility, and potential for design error <ref> [7] </ref>. Subsequent MGAP systems, with their attendantly higher clock frequencies, will have to solve the problem of slow control logic, while maintaining instruction set flexibility and ensuring an easily modifiable design. The system communicates with the outside world as a simple VME slave device.

Reference-contexts: An edge detection algorithm, using the Hough transform, which we have have developed, completely avoids expensive multiplications in favor of cheap additions and subtractions <ref> [8] </ref>. In cases where complex, expensive operations cannot be avoided or there is insufficient high-level parallelism, digit-level parallelism will still provide a significant speedup. This is illustrated by our one-dimensional wavelet transform algorithm [9]. Another application of this architecture is simulating gas dynamics [10].

Reference-contexts: Execution time for performing 100 sequence comparisons of length 100 is 1 ms. for MGAP-1, 5 ms. for SPLASH, and 4.7 s. for the CM-2 <ref> [11] </ref>. 5 Conclusion The MGAP-2 has four times as many processors and twice as much local memory as the MGAP-1. The major optimization issues employed in the MGAP-2 CPA are utilizing advanced VLSI technology, designing a more compact, higher capacity dual-port local memory, and altering pass-transistor multiplexers and latches.
