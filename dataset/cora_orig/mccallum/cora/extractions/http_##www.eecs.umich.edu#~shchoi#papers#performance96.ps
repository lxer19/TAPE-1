Abstract: ALOHA scheme with dynamic Time Division Duplexed (TDD) transmission is designed and analyzed. A centralized (i.e., star) network is adopted as the topology of a cell which consists of a base station and a number of mobile clients. In dynamic TDD transmission mode, a channel is time-shared for downlink and uplink transmissions under the dynamic access control of the base station. We first propose two MAC protocols (called TDD1 and TDD2 ) depending on how downlink and uplink transmissions are multiplexed. We then analyze throughput and average delay of TDD1 and an alternative ALOHA scheme using Frequency Division Duplexed (FDD) transmission. Finally, we evaluate the performance of these schemes, and compare TDD1 (calculations), TDD2 (simulations), and FDD (calculations). TDD schemes are found to always work as good as, or better than, FDD. TDD2 is observed to outperform TDD1 with respect to the downlink delay in the presence of light uplink and heavy downlink traffic loads while they work almost the same in other cases.

Moreover, they can easily meet the growing demand that mobile clients should have access to the existing wired and wireless networks. <p> We could instead use the Frequency Division Duplexed (FDD) mode, in which two different frequency channels are allocated for uplink and downlink transmissions. FDD, as in AMPS (FDMA), IS-54 (TDMA), and IS-95 (CDMA), is the common duplexing mode in cellular systems <ref> [2] </ref>. However, dynamic TDD allows for more efficient link utilization in the case of unbalanced uplink and downlink traffic, e.g., non-interactive data transmissions. ALOHA protocols are probably the richest family of multiple access protocols in both wired LANs [5, 6] and wireless LANs [2, 4]. <p> However, dynamic TDD allows for more efficient link utilization in the case of unbalanced uplink and downlink traffic, e.g., non-interactive data transmissions. ALOHA protocols are probably the richest family of multiple access protocols in both wired LANs [5, 6] and wireless LANs <ref> [2, 4] </ref>. In this paper, we consider two wireless MAC protocols (called TDD1 and TDD2 ), in which a slotted ALOHA protocol with dynamic TDD transmission is used to control uplink accesses. <p> like queueing and transmission delays in a cell. 1 For simplicity, we also assume that the transmission channel is error-free if 1 A cell in this paper refers to a micro-cell, which has coverage of the order of a few hundred meters, or a pico-cell, which covers small indoor areas <ref> [2] </ref>. 3 there is no collision among two or more concurrent packets. (How to achieve such error-free transmissions will be reported in a future paper.) The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the protocols considered.

Reference-contexts: Hence, mobile clients are not able to listen directly to other mobiles using the same frequency channel. This assumed situation can occur in real world due to the existence of hidden terminals <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. One important advantage of the star topology is that the network can be designed to use signal-transmission power efficiently. For example, compared to a fully-connected peer-to-peer network, mobile clients in the centralized network can reach clients at twice the distance with the same signal power.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we consider two wireless MAC protocols (called TDD1 and TDD2 ), in which a slotted ALOHA protocol with dynamic TDD transmission is used to control uplink accesses. The protocols considered here can be used to support the non-real-time communication part of the protocol described in <ref> [7] </ref>. We analyze the throughput and delay performance of TDD1 using a 2-dimensional Markov chain, while relying on simulations for the evaluation of TDD2. We show, by comparing TDD1 with an FDD-mode protocol, the efficiency/superiority of the dynamic TDD MAC protocols in centralized wireless networks.

Reference-contexts: This kind of problem can be handled with a more complicated reservation-type scheme found in <ref> [8] </ref>. 5 00. <p> Recently, we have also investigated the design and analysis of a reservation scheme, which is similar to the reservation ALOHA [11-13], with the dynamic TDD to support the non-real-time communication part of the protocol described in <ref> [8] </ref>. It was found to be a more attractive protocol with a higher uplink throughput than those schemes considered here due to the nature of the reservation of slots for uplink transmissions.

Reference-contexts: We expect TDD2 to work similarly to TDD1 when the uplink is moderately- or heavily- loaded, while it outperforms TDD1 when the uplink is lightly-loaded. For comparative evaluation of the above two TDD protocols, we consider the following alternative FDD protocol. (The original ALOHA system also used FDD mode <ref> [9] </ref>.) FDD Mode: As shown in Figure 4, the whole system employs three separate frequency bands for control, uplink, and downlink channels.
