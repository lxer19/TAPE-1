Abstract: Homework assignments will be given approximately every two weeks. Students can expect most homework assignments to be rather time-consuming. Students are encouraged to work together on the problem sets. Note that this says "work together" | copying homework solutions from another student will be considered cheating and dealt with accordingly. Homework assignments are due in class on the due date given. No late homeworks will be accepted . However, in calculating your homework average, your lowest score will be dropped.
