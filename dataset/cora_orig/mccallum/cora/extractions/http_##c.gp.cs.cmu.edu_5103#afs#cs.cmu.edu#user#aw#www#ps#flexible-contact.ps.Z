Abstract: A model for the dynamic simulation of flexible bodies subject to non-penetration constraints is presented. Flexible bodies are described in terms of global deformations of a rest shape. The dynamical behavior of these bodies that most closely matches the behavior of ideal continuum bodies is derived, and subsumes the results of earlier Lagrangian dynamics-based models. The dynamics derived for the flexible-body model allows the unification of previous work on flexible body simulation and previous work on non-penetrating rigid body simulation. The non-penetration constraints for a system of bodies that contact at multiple points are maintained by analytically calculated contact forces. An implementation for first- and second-order polynomially deformable bodies is described. The simulation of second-order or higher deformations currently involves a polyhedral boundary approximation for collision detection purposes.

Reference-contexts: For collisions involving more than one contact point, the collisions at the contact point can be considered as a sequence of collisions, slightly staggered in time. If collisions involving multiple contact points are modeled as occurring simultaneously, the approach taken by Baraff <ref> [1] </ref> can be used. 3.3 Resting contact The derivation for the resting contact forces between flexible bodies is almost the same as the derivation for resting contact forces between rigid bodies.

Reference-contexts: The non-penetration constraints for rigid bodies described in Baraff <ref> [2] </ref> are restricted to handle situations with only finitely many contact points, as described in section 3.1. Since we are restricted to situations in which inter-penetration can be prevented by considering only finitely many contact points, we can index the contact points from 1 to n. <p> Contact forces satisfying these constraints can be computed by quadratic programming [1,2]. Exactly the same formulation is used to prevent inter-penetration between flexible bodies. The expression derived for i (t 0 ) in Baraff <ref> [2] </ref> requires the spatial and temporal derivatives of functions describing the contact surfaces. <p> When deformations are limited to first-order deformations, convexity is conserved under deformation. Thus, the collision detection method described in Baraff <ref> [2] </ref> can be used without alter ation.

Reference-contexts: For any deformation function D R (t) (p) = R (t)Z (p), i (t 0 ) is a linear function of R (t 0 ), so i (t 0 ) depends linearly upon the contact forces. The contact forces can be extended to include friction as described by Baraff <ref> [3] </ref>. 4. Implementing Polynomial Deformations We have implemented flexible bodies for the cases of first- and second-order polynomial deformations. There is no difficulty in performing simulations that involve bodies with a mix of differing deformation functions. Simulations can also mix rigid and deformable bodies. <p> When performing collision detection and enforcing non-penetration constraints, the contact surface is considered to be the collection of these transformed triangles. The use of a coherence based culling step results in a collision detection algorithm that is nearly linear in the number of polygons <ref> [3] </ref>. The non-penetration constraints are written in terms of the deformed triangles. Each triangle is treated as a plane in solving for contact forces.

Reference-contexts: Starting with this estimate, D 1 computed numerically using iterative techniques <ref> [4] </ref>. However, the initial determination of the contact points in world space is a difficult problem. Even given a suitable collision detection algorithm, our simulations would be severely restricted because of the contact geometry restrictions of section 3.1.

Reference-contexts: Gauss formulated a principle called the principle of least constraint that asserts that the motion of a system subject to constraints always minimizes the "constraint", namely equation (1). The principle of least constraint yields the same result for constrained motion as is given by Lagrange's equation of motion <ref> [5] </ref>; thus, our notion of motion satisfying a minimal error criterion is equivalent to treating bodies as mechanical systems and defining their motion in terms of the very well known Lagrangian dynamics. 2.2 Linear deformations The previous section describes the dynamics when the deformation function D q (t) is arbitrary.

Reference-contexts: However, because the shape parameters are global in their effect, the stiffness problems due to local interactions are eliminated, as in the rigid case. In a different flexible-body formulation, Pentland and Williams <ref> [6] </ref> achieve much the same goal by linearizing the dynamic model, then using modal analysis to eliminate high-frequency vibrations.

Reference-contexts: Even so, if ordinary numerical methods are used, it is these high-speed effects rather than the phenomena of primary interest that dictate the size of the time steps, with potentially disastrous effects on performance <ref> [7] </ref>. Where it applies, the rigid body approximation sweeps these problems away by eliminating local interactions altogether: the only degrees of freedom a rigid body has are the global ones that govern its position and orientation. Modeling of flexible body collisions and contact raises additional problems for the nodal formulation.

(b) The entire lower rim of the cylinder must be prevented from moving below the plane. plasticity or fracture <ref> [8] </ref>. For second-order polynomial deformations, a small number of sample points (on the order of fifty) yields adequate results. 3. Non-penetration Constraints The derivation for the contact forces between flexible bodies that prevent inter-penetration closely parallels the derivation of contact forces between rigid bodies in Baraff [1,2].

Reference-contexts: Things are made still worse if penalty methods [1,3] (another local model) are used to enforce non-penetration con straints, since these introduce stiffness problems of their own. 303 SIGGRAPH '92, Chicago Computer Graphics, 26, 2, July 1992 1.2 Global models Witkin and Welch <ref> [9] </ref> present a flexible-body model that represents a compromise between the extremes of the nodal and rigid formulations. Changes in the body's shape are approximated neither by nodal displacements nor by rigid body transformations, but by global deformations that apply a parametric "space warp" to all points in the body. <p> We want the motion prescribed by this q to have the minimum possible deviation from the motion of an ideal continuum body. The expression for q derived in this paper that minimizes the deviation matches the expression derived by the earlier work of Witkin and Welch <ref> [9] </ref> using Lagrangian dynamics; thus, we show that the Lagrangian dynamics formulation satisfies our minimal approximation error criterion. The model of collision-response derived in section 3.2 is also based on a minimum error criterion. <p> Witkin and Welch <ref> [9] </ref> derive the relation R (t) = Q (t)M (4) where M is a constant square matrix and Q (t) is a matrix of the generalized net force acting on the body. <p> Section 3 discusses the computation of the contact forces included in Q (t). 2.3 Potential energy functions of linear deformations The internal forces that act to restore a flexible body to its rest shape are specified in terms of the derivative @V=@R of a potential energy function V <ref> [9] </ref>.
