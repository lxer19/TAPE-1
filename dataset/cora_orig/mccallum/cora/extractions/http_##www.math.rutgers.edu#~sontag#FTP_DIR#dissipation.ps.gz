Abstract: We suggest that a very natural mathematical framework for the study of dissipation |in the sense of Willems, Moylan and Hill, and others| is that of indefinite quasimetric spaces. Several basic facts about dissipative systems are seen to be simple consequences of the properties of such spaces. Quasimetric spaces provide also one natural context for optimal control problems, and even for "gap" formulations of robustness. This is very preliminary work, but it seems appropriate to give a conference presentation to elicit comments and suggestions, since we believe that the area has great potential for development.

Reference-contexts: W (z; x) = +1.) Thus one requires at least the nonsymmetric notion of quasi -(pseudo)metric proposed independently by Wilson and Nyemytzki in 1931 and studied by various authors since then, as well as |for studying the associated topologies| the concept of quasi-uniformity proposed by Nachbin in 1946 (see e.g. <ref> [6, 11, 7, 1] </ref>). Actually, quasimetrics are not sufficient, because the change in energy W (x; z) may be negative as well as positive (energy gain vs. loss). Thus one needs to consider indefinite quasimetrics, which we introduce in this note. <p> I am not including detailed technical assumptions, because they are irrelevant to the abstract framework to be developed. 3 When the values of W are nonnegative real numbers, an iqm is an object that has been studied extensively, and is usually called (cf. <ref> [1] </ref>) a quasi-pseudo-metric space. (The terminology varies somewhat among authors. The book [7] calls them just quasimetrics, but in the original paper [11] as well as in [1] this latter term is reserved for spaces for which, in addition, the axiom "W (x; y) &gt; 0 for all x 6= y" <p> the values of W are nonnegative real numbers, an iqm is an object that has been studied extensively, and is usually called (cf. <ref> [1] </ref>) a quasi-pseudo-metric space.

Since negative (as well as positive infinity) values are allowed, following the convention of indefinite metric spaces, it seems natural, though extremely cumbersome, to call <p> itself an iqm, one can define the positive part of an iqm W by W + := maxfW; 0g : For each nonnegative iqm W , minfW; 1g is also an iqm, and in particular W 1 + := minfW + ; 1g is a quasi-pseudo-metric in the sense of <ref> [1] </ref> (or just a quasi-metric in the terminology used in [7]). Defining W y (x; y) := W (y; x) makes (X; W y ) into another iqm space. the transpose of (X; W ). Taking f W := max W; W y provides the symmetrization of (X; W ). <p> Observe that (X; W ) is of class T 1 iff (X; W 1 + ) is, which is in turn equivalent to asking that W 1 + be a quasimetric (as opposed to a quasi-pseudo-metric); the book <ref> [1] </ref>, chapter 7, studies in detail characterizations of quasiuniformities induced by quasimetrics.

Reference-contexts: This has been noticed, though implicitly, in the control literature, among other places in the context of "gap" characterizations of robustness; the directed gap between two systems is defined in terms of a Hausdorff-type distance between graphs of behaviors; see e.g. <ref> [2, 8] </ref>, and this quantity characterizes the largest possible change in a plant for which a given controller still stabilizes. The gap metric is then defined as a symmetrization of the directed gap, but clearly the latter is the most natural notion.
