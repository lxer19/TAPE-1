Reference-contexts: So, the selection of fi clearly reflect the trade-off between transient performance and robustness. When the controller C W fi (s) = W fi (s)C opt (s) is formed, the zeros of H (s) will be poles of the controller, as prescribed by the Internal Model Principle <ref> [2] </ref>. This gives an infinite open loop gain for the modelled frequencies, and thereby zero steady state error for these frequencies, provided the closed loop is stabilized.

Reference-contexts: This particular pole placement is also reasonable because it brings the system to zero error in the shortest possible time without overshoot. With all poles being equally fast, there are no unnecessary fast modes (requiring large control signals) <ref> [7] </ref>. As will be shown below in Section 4, this kind of "fastest" transient, does not necessarily minimize the 2-norm. In fact, it will be reduced by allowing an overshoot. The minimal order controller with the internal model, will have the same amount of extra dynamics as without it.

Reference-contexts: is due to the fact that, including the model H in the denominator of the controller, we get the freedom to select just as many zeros while still preserving causality of the controller. 3 To show this, we use the simplest case of the algorithm included in the ap-pendix of <ref> [15] </ref>, which gives the total number of poles in the system (plant plus controller) m = 2 degfAg + degfHg 1 (5) and to be able to solve the design equation (3) degfR 0 g = m degfAg degfHg = degfAg 1 (6) just as without the internal model. <p> The problem is that, with this lowest order controller, we might not meet the specifications in terms of robustness and transient performance simultaneously. It is, of course, possible to include extra dynamics in the controller, and guidelines for doing this may be found in <ref> [15] </ref>. Alternatively, we may use loop shaping with a controller order reduction step. It is merely a matter of taste which of the tools being selected for design.
