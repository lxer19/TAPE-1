Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Application-based benchmarks such as the Perfect Benchmark suite <ref> [2] </ref> have gained significant acceptance and are being used as a sample of real world scientific codes to characterize, test and evaluate new and existing systems. <p> The format of the selection file is as follows: 4 NAME OF SRCFILE ( source filename in the form PGMSI.f ) NAME OF OUTFILE ( output source file in the form PGMSIN.f ) CLASSY 0 ( main_entry ) 5 ( main_exit ) [1] ( all doentry ) <ref> [2] </ref> ( all doexit ) [3] ( all subr_entry ) [4] ( all subr_exit ) [EVENT_RANGEY] ( range of events to be activated ) [start-event (I4) end-event (I4)] [start-event (I4) end-event (I4)] ................................ [EVENT_LISTY] ( a space separated list of events ) [event (I4)] [event (I4)] ................................

Reference-contexts: Finally, section 7 describes some ideas for future work with instrumented benchmarks. 2 Motivation The usual method of benchmarking is recording the program performance by a single number such as MFLOPS. As described in <ref> [3] </ref>, benchmarking has three basic purposes to evaluate exisiting machines: * selecting a new machine, * tuning of an already existing machine, and * discovering the strengths and weaknesses to be handled judiciously in a new parallel machine. Our approach has two purposes. <p> of the selection file is as follows: 4 NAME OF SRCFILE ( source filename in the form PGMSI.f ) NAME OF OUTFILE ( output source file in the form PGMSIN.f ) CLASSY 0 ( main_entry ) 5 ( main_exit ) [1] ( all doentry ) [2] ( all doexit ) <ref> [3] </ref> ( all subr_entry ) [4] ( all subr_exit ) [EVENT_RANGEY] ( range of events to be activated ) [start-event (I4) end-event (I4)] [start-event (I4) end-event (I4)] ................................ [EVENT_LISTY] ( a space separated list of events ) [event (I4)] [event (I4)] ................................
