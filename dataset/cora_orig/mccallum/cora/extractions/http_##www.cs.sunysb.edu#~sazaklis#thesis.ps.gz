Reference-contexts: Its distribution will reduce to a delta impulse (a point with a mass distribution of 1). Another point is that I S can never have values outside the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. This means that whenever the right side of 3 becomes higher than 1, or lower than 0, I S will simply be truncated (see Fig. 3.4). <p> See [77] for a survey of related results in geometric probing. The "verification" stage of our system is related to work on "testing" simple polygons with point probes to determine if it is within a given distance * of a model shape; see <ref> [1, 63, 64] </ref>. Also closely related to our work is the considerable literature on the subject of classification and regression trees, and their application to statistical decision theory; see [10, 13, 43, 67]. Previous work has focused primarily on non-geometric instances of the problem. <p> It consists of a small (axis-aligned) rectangular region on the image; typically, we use rectangles of size 2-by-k, for 5 k 10. The outcome of the probe is the average intensity of the pixels in the rectangle. (Each pixel intensity is normalized in the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref> to compensate for low contrast and variable brightness images.) The philosophy underlying the use of multiple pixels in a probe, in spite of the higher time during construction and recognition, is that, due to the averaging, the dependence of the probe result on any individual pixel will be reduced. <p> Each model corresponds to an outcome interval; by normalization, we can assume that these intervals are all subsets of <ref> [0, 1] </ref>. The "best" split is a set of k points (with k &lt; 5) in the interval arrangement that generate k + 1 children, while minimizing the model overlap between different children. <p> Due to different registrations, a probe can take different values on different samples of a certain class M . We call a model interval, the minimum interval I M <ref> [0; 1] </ref> that contains all these values. When many models are considered the result is an interval arrangement, within [0; 1]. CHAPTER 4. GEOMETRIC DECISION TREES FOR OCR 77 Some of the intervals in a model interval arrangement may overlap. <p> Due to different registrations, a probe can take different values on different samples of a certain class M . We call a model interval, the minimum interval I M <ref> [0; 1] </ref> that contains all these values. When many models are considered the result is an interval arrangement, within [0; 1]. CHAPTER 4. GEOMETRIC DECISION TREES FOR OCR 77 Some of the intervals in a model interval arrangement may overlap. This prompts us to ask what is the best way to split the interval arrangement into a set of interval collections, called clusters . <p> Note that here the notion of a model partition, does not exclude overlapping sets, as some models may have intervals that span two (or more) clusters. In our scheme we are looking for a set B i of breakpoints in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> that break the interval partition in a greedy way. Each interval between two consecutive breakpoints will correspond to a child with M i as its model set. <p> For our experiments, we have selected a value of p = 3. Then the minimization of the preceding sum can be done using Dynamic Programming in O (n 2 ). A set B i 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> of breakpoints is produced, and a child is associated with the intervals [B i ; B i+1 ]. <p> If a character shows in the distribution file, but it is not among the models, it is also ignored. -g Greediness (float) Sets the greediness level. The greediness is a float in <ref> [0, 1] </ref> that specifies the maximum greediness that can be tolerated in a probe. It is used during probe selection at a node.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, modeling noise that affects documents, for example, without specific assumptions on its form seems very difficult, and we will have to resort to some heuristic method. Other people that have followed this approach include Gary Kopec and Phil Chou [37] and Henry Baird <ref> [5] </ref>. Gary Kopec and Phil Chou are also adopting a communications theory standpoint and are proposing modeling distortions as Markov processes that modify the original ideal image. Then the recognition engine will try to decode the distorted image and output the content that produced the original image with maximum probability. <p> That is far from reality, though, as a significant source of noise are blobs and dirt that affect all the pixels in a small area. Henry Baird <ref> [5] </ref> has also pursued this line of research and proposed a list of deformations that may affect the scanned image. He included such deformations as scanning, jitter, skew, sensor sensitivity etc.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, other systems <ref> [35] </ref> choose not to fix a predetermined position for the character but shift the character over all different positions and take the maximum response. <p> We prefer the method of registration, because trying all different displacements will incur heavy overhead and the only realistic solution for a practical system is to implement the "shifting" operation in hardware, as <ref> [35] </ref> acknowledges. Our registration method is simple: We take into account only the bounding box of the character. The bounding box is defined as the minimum parallel to the axes rectangular box that encloses the scanned character.

Reference-contexts: This noise sensitivity has guided us to use contour analysis for the proper distinction between D and O. The technique used is similar to the contour analysis discrimination technique described in <ref> [36] </ref>, except that we look only at upper and lower left corners instead of cutting and analyzing 8 pieces of the exterior contour as is done there. We can see that for some confusion sets skeleton utilization is more appropriate, while in other cases contour analysis is necessary.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, modeling noise that affects documents, for example, without specific assumptions on its form seems very difficult, and we will have to resort to some heuristic method.

Gary Kopec and Phil Chou are also adopting a communications theory standpoint and are proposing modeling distortions as Markov processes that modify the original ideal image.

Reference-contexts: It is interesting that exactly those features which make reading Times Roman difficult for the computer (stroke width variability and serifs) make it easier for human readers. (Experiments with human subjects have shown that Times-Roman is easier to read than a non-serifed font, such as Helvetica. <ref> [66, 41] </ref>) The 10-point size was selected because it is more difficult for recognition than the more commonly used 12-point size. To test the recognition capability of the system, without being obstructed by segmentation, we printed the characters with sufficient spacing so that segmentation was straightforward.

Reference-contexts: Consider for example the confusion pair K-X. If the strokes on the left side are collinear, we have a K, while if collinearity occurs between the diagonal strokes we have an X. We also use negative constraints for greater reliability. (See <ref> [59] </ref> for the importance of negative constraints in a general context). For a K, the diagonal strokes are required not to be collinear. This constraint was introduced because K's rival, X, has collinear diagonal strokes. We see that the constraints on a character cannot be deduced from its shape alone. <p> At the following, we describe the technique used to attack the constraint problem for characters of class I. Our method does clustering on the input character, similar to the one described in <ref> [59] </ref>. The strokes of the input graph are grouped in clusters according to their slope. Thus members of each cluster are nearly parallel to each other. Next, the clusters of parallel strokes are further divided into sub-clusters of (almost) collinear strokes.

The mktree software package is used to build Decision Tree Classifiers for the fast and accurate recognition of machine-printed text. <p> If the file exists, the tree will be appended to it. Otherwise, the file will be created. -deg TreeDegree This option controls the maximum degree of the tree. As explained in the review for decision tree classifiers <ref> [67] </ref> a smaller tree degree will produce a more reliable but larger tree. For touching characters, when the size of the tree is huge, this should be set to 3. For other trees. it can be left to its default value, 2.
