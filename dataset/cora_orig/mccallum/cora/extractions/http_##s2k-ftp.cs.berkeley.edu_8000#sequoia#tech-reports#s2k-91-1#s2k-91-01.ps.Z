Reference-contexts: At the University of Colorado, IMagic is extensively used for analysis of data from the NOAA meteorological satellites. SDSC has developed and implemented a production hardcopy server that allows all members of a network access to a suite of hardcopy media for imagesslides, movies, color paper <ref> [BAIL91] </ref>. This capability is to be expanded to allow automated production of videotapes, from time-sequenced images. Another major network-based visualization project underway at SDSC is the building of a prototype server for volume visualization. Front-end processes elsewhere on the network can connect to it and submit data files for rendering.

Reference-contexts: Finally, mature techniques exist for indexing and retrieving textual documents based on automatic and manual indexing using keywords, thesaurus terms, and classification schemes. Statistically-based probabilistic match techniques have been developed that present the "best-matching" documents to the user in response to an imprecise query <ref> [BELK87, LARS91] </ref>. These techniques must be extended to deal with indexing large collections of complete textual documents, rather than just collections of document surrogates (i.e. titles and abstracts). It is well-known that standard keyword-based techniques for document retrieval are intrinsically limited [COOP88].

Reference-contexts: That is, bio-optical models can be used to accurately predict oceanic primary production given a knowledge of PAR and column-integrated pigment biomass <ref> [BIDI87, SMIT87a, SMIT87b, SMIT91] </ref>. Pigment biomass can be estimated spatially using satellite ocean color sensors (CZCS, SeaWIFS, MODIS-T on EOS) and temporally using moored optical sensors [SMIT87b, SMIT91].

Reference-contexts: A continuing goal is to improve the GCM treatment of clouds by comparing the model results with recent observations, particularly satellite remote sensing data <ref> [CHER91] </ref>. A second line of research is to use the GCM to provide information on the regional aspects of cloud feedback.

Reference-contexts: Shortcomings of Current Data Systems UC Global Change researchers have learned that serious problems in the data systems available to them impede their ability to access needed data and thereby do research <ref> [CEES91] </ref>. In particular, five major shortcomings in current data systems have been identified: 1) Current storage management system technology is inadequate to store and access the massive amounts of data required.

Reference-contexts: Spectral reflectances of other materials, such as soil and dead litter generally increase smoothly with wavelength, resulting in lower reflectance in near-infrared wavelengths. There is an approximately linear relationship between amount of photosynthetically available radiation (APAR) and the near-infrared/visible reflectance ratio <ref> [MONT77, HATF84, SELL86, CHOU87] </ref>. Spectral reflectance ratios are closely related to instantaneous rates of activity (photosynthesis, transpiration). Their relationship to structural properties of the canopy such as biomass and leaf area index is monotonic but non-linear.

Reference-contexts: In addition, we plan to modify it to allow applications to specify that they don't require error control (and thus, alleviating the need for software checksum computations, retransmissions, and timer management, which represent major parts of the overall packet delay <ref> [CLAR89] </ref>). Notice also that, for real-time traffic, a transport layer relying on RTIP has little functionality to add, and thus can be made very lightweight. Therefore, we will consider implementing a transport layer protocol from scratch.

Reference-contexts: These techniques must be extended to deal with indexing large collections of complete textual documents, rather than just collections of document surrogates (i.e. titles and abstracts). It is well-known that standard keyword-based techniques for document retrieval are intrinsically limited <ref> [COOP88] </ref>. In general, for the best keyword-based techniques to retrieve 90% of the desired documents, only 10% of what is retrieved is what the user desired.

Reference-contexts: Among the Grand Challenges for computing in the next decade, study of Global Change will require great improvements in monitoring, modeling and predicting the coupled interactions within the components of the Earth's subsystems <ref> [CPM91] </ref>. The Earth Sciences of meteorology, oceanography, bioclimatology, geochemistry, and hydrology grew up independently of each other. Observational methods, theories, and numerical models were developed separately for each discipline. Beginning about 20 years ago, two forces have favored the growth of a new discipline, Earth System Science.

Reference-contexts: In general, for the best keyword-based techniques to retrieve 90% of the desired documents, only 10% of what is retrieved is what the user desired. To improve on the performance of such systems, some analysis of the content of the texts and of the users' queries is required <ref> [CROF89, SMIT89] </ref>. Such analysis is difficult on arbitrary text because it requires recourse to knowledge of the domain to which the text pertains, and entails solving hard general problems of natural language processing. However, in narrow enough domains, natural language processing techniques can provide enough analysis to significantly improve performance.

Reference-contexts: Over land, similar but more complex models can be applied to relate indices of vegetation to vegetation amount and activity. Green leaves are the only Earth-surface materials that strongly absorb visible wavelengths while reflecting strongly in the near-infrared wavelengths longer than 0.7 mm <ref> [CURR81] </ref>. Spectral reflectances of other materials, such as soil and dead litter generally increase smoothly with wavelength, resulting in lower reflectance in near-infrared wavelengths. There is an approximately linear relationship between amount of photosynthetically available radiation (APAR) and the near-infrared/visible reflectance ratio [MONT77, HATF84, SELL86, CHOU87].

Reference-contexts: The data will be sent to UCSB, where they will be analyzed by the snow-mapping algorithms <ref> [DOZ81] </ref> and then integrated into the BIGFOOT system. The data base will include information about the algorithm generation, calibration coefficients, etc. so that long time series can be checked for consistency.

Reference-contexts: In addition, reduced-volume products will be compressed and sent to cooperating investigators in universities and laboratories throughout the western U.S. The snow-cover maps from the 1-km-resolution AVHRR data will be periodically validated with higher resolution data, from Landsat Thematic Mapper (7 spectral bands, 30 m resolution) <ref> [DOZ89] </ref>, SPOT (4 bands, 10 and 20 m resolution), and AVIRIS (224 bands, 20 m resolution) [DOZ90a]. Algorithms using the higher-resolution data need to be combined with digital elevation models, available from the U.S. Geological Survey. Radiation calculations on these data are used to drive energy-balance snowmelt models [DOZ90b].

Radiation calculations on these data are used to drive energy-balance snowmelt models <ref> [DOZ90b] </ref>. To extend these studies to other parts of the world, it will be necessary to archive and manage a global 1 km data set from AVHRR. NASA is assembling such a data set, to cover one year, and will make it available to us.

Reference-contexts: A tape jukebox in the 19" form-factor can hold .5 Terabyte in the technology available today, with a doubling expected within the next 1 to 2 years <ref> [EXAB90] </ref>. These tapes only transfer at the rate of .2 Mbyte/second, but once they are coupled with striping techniques, it should be possible to stage and destage between disk and tape at the rate of 4 Mbytes/second.

Reference-contexts: A final issue is that the protocols to be executed on the host workstations, the gateways, and the switches (or the switch controllers) will have to include provisions for real-time channel establishment/disestablishment <ref> [FERR90a] </ref>, so that guarantees about the network's performance (throughput, delay, and delay jitter) can be offered to the users who need them [FERR90b]. A related issue is the specification of quality of network service needed by the user. <p> A network layer protocol (RTIP) and some ideas that address this problem of providing end-to-end performance guarantees have been described in [LOWE91] following the methodology for real-time virtual circuit establishment provided in <ref> [FERR90a] </ref>. An important feature of the RTIP is that it is an extension of IP (the Internet network layer protocol), and interoperates with it. We propose to implement RTIP, by extending IP, and to experimentally evaluate its performance. We also need to extend TCP to make use of RTIP.

A related issue is the specification of quality of network service needed by the user. Such a specification must be powerful enough to describe the required guarantees, and yet must be realizable by mechanisms that already exist, or that can be built into the networks of interest. 2.1.4.

Reference-contexts: The relationship of spectral vegetation indices to surface biophysical conditions is complicated by atmospheric effects, solar geometry, topography, vegetation structure and canopy shadows, and variable soil reflectance. Models of radiative transfer in plant canopies are under development to strengthen the relationship between reflectance data and canopy conditions <ref> [FRAN91] </ref>. Alternative vegetation indices that account for variations in soil background also appear promising [HUET88, MAJO90]. Combining satellite imagery with digital maps of topography, soils, and land management can be used to greatly improve the relationship between spectral properties and surface conditions [DAVI90, DAVI91].

As our second approach to the repository, we expect to explore this "pan and zoom" paradigm, popularized for military ships by SDMS <ref> [HERO80] </ref>. 2.2.3. Interoperability Users wish to share programs as well as data sets that are stored in the repository. Hence, a program written by one researcher must be usable by a second researcher.

Reference-contexts: One coupled air-sea climate phenomenon in which recent research has shown strong sensitivity to cloud-radiation interactions is the Indian monsoon <ref> [IACO91] </ref>, and one goal of model improvements is to achieve greater predictive skill in monsoon forecasting.

Reference-contexts: Our research group has pioneered the development of RAID technology, a new way to construct high bandwidth, high availability disk systems based on arrays of small form factor disks <ref> [KATZ89] </ref>. The bandwidth comes from striping data across many disk actuators and harnessing this inherent parallelism to dramatically improve transfer rates.

Reference-contexts: This is particularly relevant when one is fast-forwarding through a sequence of images; supporting full resolution might not be possible, and users might be willing to accept a lower resolution picture in return for faster movement. One approach to this problem is hierarchical coding <ref> [KARL89] </ref>, whereby a unit of information such as an image is decomposed into a set of ordered sub-images. A selected subset of these may be re-composed to obtain various levels of resolution of the original image.

Reference-contexts: Researchers at Berkeley have extensive experience with 7 file caching and migration <ref> [SMIT81, KURE87, NELS88] </ref>. Although we hope to apply much of this experience to the proposed system, the scale of the system, the performance characteristics of the storage devices, and the access patterns will be different enough to require new techniques. This investigation will occur in two different contexts.

Reference-contexts: Finally, mature techniques exist for indexing and retrieving textual documents based on automatic and manual indexing using keywords, thesaurus terms, and classification schemes. Statistically-based probabilistic match techniques have been developed that present the "best-matching" documents to the user in response to an imprecise query <ref> [BELK87, LARS91] </ref>. These techniques must be extended to deal with indexing large collections of complete textual documents, rather than just collections of document surrogates (i.e. titles and abstracts). It is well-known that standard keyword-based techniques for document retrieval are intrinsically limited [COOP88]. <p> Furthermore, as the electronic repository gets constructed, we propose to extend the POSTGRES indexing paradigm to meet its needs. The initial indexing system that we propose to adapt for this purpose is contained in the CHESIRE information retrieval package <ref> [LARS91] </ref>.

This system, GRASS, will give Sequoia researchers a convenient set of user interface routines.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, there are no existing protocols that deal with the synthesis of end-to-end guaranteed performance channels from a set of such channels and networks in tandem. A network layer protocol (RTIP) and some ideas that address this problem of providing end-to-end performance guarantees have been described in <ref> [LOWE91] </ref> following the methodology for real-time virtual circuit establishment provided in [FERR90a]. An important feature of the RTIP is that it is an extension of IP (the Internet network layer protocol), and interoperates with it. We propose to implement RTIP, by extending IP, and to experimentally evaluate its performance.

In this case one desires instance indexing on the set of values returned by a function.

Reference-contexts: Current commercial relational data base systems (e.g. DB 2, RDB, ORACLE, INGRES, etc.) are not good at managing these kinds of data. During the last several years a variety of next generation DBMSs have been built, including IRIS [WILK90], ORION [KIM90], POSTGRES <ref> [STON90] </ref>, and Starburst [HAAS90]. The more general of these systems appear to be usable, at least to some extent, for point, vector, and text data. <p> Data Management Issues In some environments it is desirable to use a DBMS rather than the file system to manage collections of large objects. Hence, we propose to extend the next-generation DBMS POSTGRES <ref> [STON90] </ref> to effectively manage Global Change data. There are three avenues of extension that we propose to explore. First, POSTGRES has been designed to effectively manage point, vector and text data. However, satellite data are series of large multidimensional arrays.

Reference-contexts: Such migration might simply depend on the algorithms of the underlying file system discussed above to manage storage. However, the DBMS understands the logical structure of the data and can make more intelligent partitioning decisions as noted in <ref> [STON91] </ref>. If both the file system and the DBMS are managing storage, then it is important to investigate the proper interface between DBMS managed storage and operating system managed storage. This issue arises in disk-based environments, and is more severe in an environment which includes tertiary memory. <p> Only in this way can media changes be minimized during query processing. Also, processing of large objects must be deferred as long as possible in a query plan, as suggested in <ref> [STON91] </ref>. 9 The third area where we propose investigations concerns indexing. The conventional DBMS paradigm is to provide value indexing. Hence, one can designate one or more fields in a record as indexed, and POSTGRES will build the appropriate kind of index on the data in the required fields.
