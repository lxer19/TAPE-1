Title: Abstract  
Keyword: 3-D Registration, Pose Estimation, High-Speed Pose Tracking, Geometric Constraint-Based Data Selection  
Abstract: The goal of intra-surgical registration is to establish a common reference frame between pre-surgical and intra-surgical 3-D data sets that correspond to the same anatomy. This paper presents two novel techniques which have application to this problem: high-speed pose tracking, and intra-surgical data selection. In the first part of this paper, we describe an approach for tracking the pose of arbitrarily-shaped rigid objects at rates up to 10Hz. Static accuracies on the order of 1mm in translation and 1 degree in rotation have been achieved. We have demonstrated the technique on a human face using a high-speed VLSI range sensor; however, the technique is independent of the sensor used or the anatomy tracked. In the second part of this paper, we describe a general purpose approach for selecting near-optimal, intra-surgical registration data. Due to high costs associated with the acquisition of intra-surgical data, it is desirable to minimize the amount of data acquired, while ensuring that registration accuracy requirements are met. We synthesize near-optimal intra-surgical data sets, based upon an analysis of differential surface properties of pre-surgical data. We demonstrate, using data from a human femur, that discrete point data sets selected using our method provide superior pose refinement accuracy to those selected by human experts.

Reference-contexts: However, as suggested in [2] and demonstrated in [32], this complexity can be reduced to by the use of a k-dimensional binary tree, or simply kd-tree <ref> [1] </ref>. The use of kd-trees for closest point computation allows us to decide at each node of a binary tree on which side of a hyperplane the closest point will lie. Thus, large regions of the search space can be pruned at each level in the search.

Reference-contexts: In fiducial-less approaches to registration, the (D i , M i ) correspondences are unknown a priori. An approach for estimating pose despite these unknown correspondences was introduced in a paper by Besl and McKay <ref> [2] </ref>. Below is an overview of the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm presented in that paper: 1. For each point D i in the Data set, compute the closest point (Euclidean distance) M i which lies on the surface of the Model set. 2. <p> In general there is no guarantee that ICP will converge to the global minimum, however we have found convergence to be very good in practice. Techniques exist for finding the global minimum when non-global convergence is a problem <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> In general if there are points in the Data set and geometric entities (i.e.: points, lines, triangles) in the Model set, then the complexity of a single closest point query is . However, as suggested in <ref> [2] </ref> and demonstrated in [32], this complexity can be reduced to by the use of a k-dimensional binary tree, or simply kd-tree [1]. <p> Thus, during initial ization each triangle must be stored in both its 2D and 3-D representations. 2.2.4 Acceleration A final speed improvement was realized using a modified version of the accelerated ICP algorithm de scribed in <ref> [2] </ref>. The accelerated ICP algorithm adds the following step to the basic algorithm (after step 2): 2b.If the incremental transformations (R, T) at iterations k-1, k-2, and k-3 are well aligned, extrapolate the current incremental transformation. <p> Additional system performance results can be found in [28]. 3. A fully automated initialization which does not require user input would be possible by applying one of the techniques for solving the global pose estimation problem discussed in <ref> [2] </ref>. T M T M D j [ ] D j 1 [ ] D j 1 [ ] We have demonstrated the high-speed tracker by estimating the pose of real human faces. The polygonal mesh surface model of one of these faces is seen in Figure 5.

Reference-contexts: For each point D i in the Data set, compute the closest point (Euclidean distance) M i which lies on the surface of the Model set. 2. Using the correspondences from step 1, find R and T which minimize the equation (1) via the method described in <ref> [3] </ref>. 3. Apply the incremental transformation from step 2 to all points in the Data. 4. If the relative changes in R and T are less than a threshold, e, terminate, else goto 1. The ICP algorithm works quite well, especially when an approximate pose estimate is available for initialization.

Reference-contexts: Thus, large regions of the search space can be pruned at each level in the search. We have implemented a closest point algorithm based on the kd-tree <ref> [4] </ref>. As demonstrated below, the use of kd-trees was the most significant factor in improving the speed of ICP execution. 2.2.2 Closest Point Caching A second small speed improvement was realized by caching closest points.

Reference-contexts: Recent approaches to 3D registration attempt to eliminate the need for fiducials and manual specification of correspondences by using features which are intrinsic to the data. For example, researchers have attempted to match intrinsic features such as: bounding contours to surfaces [17], ridge lines to ridge lines <ref> [8] </ref>, surfaces to surfaces [12], and discrete points to surfaces [6][16][22][28]. When the patient anatomy being registered is fixed in space, 3-D registration need be performed only once to establish a common reference frame.

We have, however, been able to characterize the dynamic repeatability of the tracker.
