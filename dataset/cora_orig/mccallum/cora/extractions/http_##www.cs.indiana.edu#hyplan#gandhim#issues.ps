Reference-contexts: At this level, a track is viewed as an atomic element. While there is work at the extremes of the granu larity spectrum, issues at the track level of granularity have been largely unexplored (save for <ref> [BGT92, GBT92] </ref>). For example, at the finest level of granularity, there exist many multimedia standards for interpreting bit streams as audio or video data [LG91, Wal91, Poh92].

Reference-contexts: At the coarsest level of granularity, current database technology [EN89] or other evolving paradigms [HBvR94, NKN91] may be used to organize a set of tracks. In the rest of this abstract, we concentrate on the exposition of issues at the track level. We use the three paradigms in computing <ref> [DCG + 89] </ref> theory, modeling, and design to organize the exposition.

Reference-contexts: The interface between the Client and the Presentation Server poses an interesting issue. The presentation of the data depends on both the type of data and the dynamics of the user input, but the interaction between the two is not defined at any point. The idea of presentation model <ref> [HS94] </ref> may be useful here, and needs to be explored in the context of databases. Finally, standard issues of a client-server architecture, such as division of functionality between the client and the server, need to be researched from perspective of media tracks.

Reference-contexts: The application consists of Presentation Server and Presentation Client modules. The primary issue at the Server is its storage model. Most storage model decisions will be based on the high throughput requirements of media tracks. In this context, a few techniques are worth inspecting. Striping <ref> [LS93] </ref> places the atoms of a track on multiple disks, so that disk seeks are parallelized. Interleaving alternates the storage of atoms of simultaneously played tracks. Of course, compression is another important technique, but it is most successful when considered at the media atom layer.
