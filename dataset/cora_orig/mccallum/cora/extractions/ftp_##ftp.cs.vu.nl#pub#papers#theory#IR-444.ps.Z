Title: On a functor for probabilistic bisimulation and preservation of weak pullbacks

Abstract: The preservation of weak pullbacks is studied for a functor M 1 on the category UMS of ultrametric spaces and nonexpansive mappings. The functor M 1 associates with an ultrametric space its collection of Borel probability measures with compact support. By application of the Max-flow Min-cut Theorem of graph theory a mediating morphism for a weak pullback diagram can be constructed in SET. It is shown that the functor M 1 as functor from UMS to SET preserves weak pullbacks. A possible solution for the preservation of weak pullbacks by M 1 as UMS-functor is indicated.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The notion of a coalgebra turns out to be one of the key concepts for an understanding of bisimulation from a category theoretical perspective. See, e.g., <ref> [AM89, RT93, Rut96, JR97] </ref>. In the coalgebraic approach bisimulation can be considered with respect to any functor. Of course, some functors are more appealing to use for the description of computational phenomena than others.

Reference-contexts: Is in proven in the technical report [VR97b], that M 1 is well-defined, preserves completeness and is locally nonexpansive. Thus the functor can be employed for the construction of semantical domains via metric domain equations a la America/Rutten (cf. <ref> [AR89, RT93] </ref>). Also, it is shown that a suitable functor based on M 1 possesses a final coalgebra. However, for M 1 to be a first-class citizen in the world of categorical bisimulation it should preserve weak pullbacks. In this note only a partial result can be obtained for this.

Reference-contexts: Proof See [Hal74, x11-13]. 2 Intuitively the support of measure is the set that carries the mass of the measure; outside the support the measure vanishes (cf. <ref> [Bar88] </ref>). In the next section we will discuss a functor that yields for an ultrametric space the collection of all Borel probability measures of compact support. The restriction to measure of compact support is essential for the completeness result as obtained in [VR97b].

Reference-contexts: Of course, some functors are more appealing to use for the description of computational phenomena than others. Final coalgebra theorems provide conditions for a functor that guarantee the existence of `greatest' solution of domain equations, usually by exploiting the structure of the underlying category. See <ref> [RT93, Bar93, Mon98] </ref>. Another useful feature concerns the preservation of weak pullbacks by a functor. This property does not only imply transitivity of the notion of F -bisimulation induced by a functor F , but is also fundamental for the construction of a final semantics.

Reference-contexts: The proof in [VR97b] employs a max-flow min-cut theorem for this (see below). By diagram chasing one can easily show: if a category A has pullbacks and a functor F : A ! B transforms pullbacks into weak pullbacks, then F preserves weak pullbacks. Graph theory (see, e.g., <ref> [Bol79] </ref>) A network N is a 4-tuple N = hG; c; s; ti where G = hV; Ei is a directed graph with set of vertices V and set of edges E, c: E !

Reference-contexts: An important consequence of the property of preserving weak pullbacks is that F -bisimulation in any F -coalgebra coincides with equality in the final coalgebra of F (cf. [Rut96, Theorem 9.3]). For discrete probabilistic transition systems the notion of Larsen-Skou bisimulation as introduced in <ref> [LS91] </ref> is the standard process equivalence.
