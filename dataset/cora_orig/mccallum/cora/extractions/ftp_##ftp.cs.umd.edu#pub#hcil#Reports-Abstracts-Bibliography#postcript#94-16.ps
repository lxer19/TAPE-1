Abstract: Dynamic queries are user-controlled animated displays of visual or textual data. On an application developed for the National Center for Health Statistics and running on their ordinary staff equipment, a thematic map of the United States is animated by moving a time slider to illustrate trends of mortality rates. Other sliders filter parts of the maps interactively according to parameters such as demographics. During the filtering possible correlations can be observed as they create color patterns in the "dissapearance" of the states. This application has been received with enthusiasm by the user community and will be distributed with selected new datasets. Dynamic queries Dynamic queries (DQs) are user-controlled animated displays of visual or textual data. Several experiments have demonstrated that dynamic queries help users find trends and exception conditions [1, 2]. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) proposed to investigate the use of dynamic queries as a health statistics exploration tool. The resulting application will be made available to researchers and epidemiologists with the release of selected new datasets. Displaying spatio-temporal statistics Traditionally, health statisticslike many other statistics are made available through tables of averages, graphs and pages of detail data. Printed maps and atlases are used but access to detail is lost since all values are split by only a few categories used for the color coding; users still must refer to tables. Geographical Information Systems are now reaching the desktop world but they remain aimed at the production of maps rather than the exploration and rapid browsing of maps. Showing time trends For maps, time trends are traditionally shown as a series of small maps. Some software packages allow canned animations to be prepared and shown to illustrate findings. Real-time animation is repeatedly cited in the literature (e.g. [3]) but only as a desirable future development or reserved for high-end equipment. We believe that giving users control of the animation is a determining factor of the application's success. (Actually the video itself cannot quite convey the sense of control since it is the equivalent of a canned animation program.) GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERFACES After the selection of a cause of death and of three parameters representing possible demographic confounders, a map of the US is displayed with the chosen mortality rate color coded for each state (e.g. the Cervix Uteri cancer rate [figure 1]). The states where the cancer rate is high are red (dark on the figure), the states where the rates are low appear blue and the other states are gray. On the right of the screen four sliders provide control over the map animation. Showing time trends When the year slider is moved from 1950 to 1970 the color of each state changes in real time, reflecting each state's rate change. Our example shows the overall decline in cervix uteri cancer rates over the years as well as geographical clusters. Querying In our example the three chosen query parameters for each state are the percentage of the population who went to college, the per-capita income and the percentage of smokers. The user may set upper and lower bounds on the
