Abstract: New reactive behaviors that implement formations in multi-robot teams are presented and evaluated. These motor schemas, or primitive behaviors, for relative positional maintenance are integrated with existing navigational behaviors to help robots complete navigational tasks while in formation. Four formations, based on existing military doctrine (Army 1986), and three methods for determining correct vehicle position are investigated. The performance of a group of four simulated robots using this technique is evaluated quantitatively for both turning and for navigation across an obstacle field. These team behaviors will ultimately be fielded on four military vehicles as part of ARPA's UGV Demo II program.

Reference-contexts: In addition to maintaining their position in formation, robots must also move to a specified goal location while avoiding collisions with obstacles. The formation behaviors presented here are implemented as motor schemas, a type of reactive navigational strategy <ref> (Arkin 1989) </ref>. Motor schemas operate as concurrent asynchronous processes each of which fl To appear in Proceedings of the First International Conference on Multiagent Systems, San Francisco. instantiates a high-level behavioral intention. Perception is translated into a response vector for each active behavior. <p> Perception is translated into a response vector for each active behavior. The resulting responses are summed and normalized and then output for execution by the mobile vehicle. Readers desiring additional information on schema-based reactive control are referred to <ref> (Arkin 1989) </ref>. Background Formation behaviors in nature, like flocking and schooling, benefit the animals that use them in various ways. Each animal in a herd, for instance, benefits by minimizing its encounters with predators (Veheren-camp 1987). <p> The motor schemas, move-to-goal, avoid-static-obstacle, avoid-robot, and maintain-formation, respectively, implement these behaviors. An additional background schema, noise, serves as a form of reactive "grease", dealing with some of the problems endemic to purely reactive navigational methods <ref> (Arkin 1989) </ref>. Each schema generates neighbor) a vector representing the desired behavioral response (direction and magnitude of movement) for the robot given the current sensory stimuli provided by the environment. A gain value is used to indicate the relative importance of the individual behaviors. <p> The high-level combined behavior is generated by multiplying the outputs of each primitive behavior by its gain, then summing and normalizing the results. The gains and other schema parameters used for the results presented in this paper are listed in Table 1. See <ref> (Arkin 1989) </ref> for a complete discussion of the computational basis and parameter definitions for the avoid-static-obstacle, move-to-goal and noise motor schemas.

Reference-contexts: His analysis centered on feedback control for formation maintenance and stability of the resulting system. It did not include integrative strategies for obstacle avoidance and navigation. In work by Chen and Luh <ref> (Chen & Luh 1994) </ref> formation generation by distributed control is demonstrated. Large groups of robots are shown to cooperatively move in various geometric formations. This research also centered on the analysis of group dynamics and stability, and does not provide for obstacle avoidance.

Reference-contexts: Studies of flocking and schooling show that these behaviors emerge as a combination of a desire to stay in the group and yet simultaneously keep a separation distance from other members of the group <ref> (Cullen, Shaw, & Baldwin 1965) </ref>. Since groups of artificial agents could similarly benefit from formation tactics, robotics researchers and those in the artificial life community have drawn from these biological studies to develop formation behaviors for both simulated agents and robots.

Reference-contexts: Each of the components is computed separately, then combined for movement output. An important contribution of Reynold's work is the generation of successful overall group behavior while individual agents only sense their local environment and close neighbors. Hodgins and Brogan <ref> (Hodgins & Brogan 1994) </ref> have recently extended this work for artificial herds of one-legged animals. Their results are even more visually realistic than Reynolds' because they also simulate the mechanics of motion; Reynolds' approach utilized particle models only.

Results were generated using Georgia Tech's Mis-sionLab robot simulation environment <ref> (MacKenzie, Cameron, & Arkin 1995) </ref>. MissionLab runs on Sun SPARCs under SunOS and the X11 graphical window-ing system. The simulation environment is a 1000 by 1000 meter two dimensional "playing field" upon which various sizes and distributions of circular obstacles can be scattered.

Reference-contexts: The behaviors described in this paper differ in that positions relative to the group are specified and maintained for each active robot. Other recent related papers on formation control for robot teams include (Parker 1994; Yoshida, Arai, & Yomoyoshi 1994; Gage 1992). Parker's thesis <ref> (Parker 1994) </ref> concerns the coordination of multiple heterogeneous robots. Of particular interest is her work in implementing "bounding overwatch," a military movement technique for teams of agents; one group moves (bounds) a short distance, while the other group overwatches for danger.

Reference-contexts: An early application of artificial formation behavior was the behavioral simulation of flocks of birds and schools of fish for computer graphics. Important results in this area originated in Craig Reynolds pioneering work <ref> (Reynolds 1987) </ref>. He developed a simple egocentric behavioral model for flocking which is instantiated in each member of the simulated group of birds (or "boids"). The behavior consists of several separate components, including: inter-agent collision avoidance, velocity matching and flock centering.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, our research studies behaviors for a small group (four) of mobile robots, striving to maintain a specific geometric formation. The dynamics and stability of multi-robot formations has drawn recent attention (Wang 1991; Chen & Luh 1994). Wang <ref> (Wang 1991) </ref> developed a strategy for robot formations where individual robots are given specific positions to maintain relative to a leader or neighbor. Sensory requirements for these robots are reduced since they only need to know about a few other robots.
