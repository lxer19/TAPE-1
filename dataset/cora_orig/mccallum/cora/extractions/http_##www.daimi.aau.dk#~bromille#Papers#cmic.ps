Abstract: We present a new complexity theoretic approach to incremental computation. We define complexity classes that capture the intuitive notion of incremental efficiency and study their relation to existing complexity classes. We show that problems that have small sequential space complexity also have small incremental time complexity. We show that all common LOGSPACE-complete problems for P are also incr -POLYLOGTIME-complete for P. We introduce a restricted notion of completeness called NRP-completeness and show that problems which are NRP-complete for P are also incr -POLYLOGTIME-complete for P. We also give incrementally complete problems for NLOGSPACE, LOGSPACE, and non-uniform NC 1 . We show that under certain restrictions problems which have efficient dynamic solutions also have efficient parallel solutions. We also consider a non-uniform model of incremental computation and show that in this model most problems have almost linear complexity. In addition, we present some techniques for lower bounding the complexity of explicitly defined problems. We also look at the time complexity of circuit value and network stability problems restricted to comparator gates. We show that the comparator-circuit value problem and the "Lex-First Maximal Matching" problem are in incr -LOGSPACE while the comparator-network stability and the "Man-Optimal Stable Marriage Problem" are in rincr -LOGSPACE(NLOGSPACE). This shows that the dynamic versions of these problems are solvable quickly in parallel even though there are no known NC algorithms to solve them from scratch. fl This paper reports the combined work of research efforts that have appeared in shortened form in "A complexity theoretic approach to incremental computation," by S. Sairam, J. S. Vitter, and R. Tamassia (STACS '93), and "On-line reevaluation of functions," by P. B. Miltersen (Tech-report, Aarhus university).

Reference-contexts: We therefore have to resort to non-determinism to recognize and traverse cycles so that we don't keep going around the same cycle over and over again. A complete proof is provided in the appendix. Subramanian <ref> [24] </ref> has shown that a number of problems concerning stable marriage are equivalent to the problem of network stability in comparator gates. Decision problems based on the "man-optimal stable marriage problem" and other problems parsimoniously reducible to the comparator network stability problem are therefore in rincr -LOGSPACE (NLOGSPACE). <p> However we are unable to show that CC is in rincr -LOGSPACE (NLOGSPACE); this is because the many-one reduction used by Subramanian <ref> [24] </ref> may not be parsimonious. In particular we don't know whether the network stability problem on non-bipartitionable X-gates is in rincr -LOGSPACE (NLOGSPACE). We believe that the classes incr TIME and incr SPACE are an important means for getting a better understanding of the relationship between incremental and parallel computation.
