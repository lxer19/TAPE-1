Abstract: We present an egomotion estimation method for a monocular observer moving with arbitrary motion. The method is uniquely based on the normal flow field and the estimation problem is defined in a particular topological space the L-space to allow the use of global data for the final estimates. Additionally, robust statistics methods are used for motion model selection, and provide improved robustness to image noise and data outliers.
