Abstract: In this paper a direct noise analysis approach for mixed-mode systems is presented with experimental results compared with results from the traditional Monte Carlo approach. The direct approach computes noise effects by performing arithmetic on moments of distribution functions that characterize electronic noise. One key advantage of this approach is its ability to compute low error probabilities. From experimental results, it is shown that very low order moments, such as second order, are sufficient for a good estimate of noise effects.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, there are no noise simulators that can analyze noise effects for mixed-mode systems. To develop such a simulator, we follow the behavioral simulation paradigm in which circuits are modeled mathematically as in <ref> [1] </ref> [2][3][4]. In this paper, we present a new noise behavioral model and a direct noise analysis approach for mixed-mode systems. Using the appropriate model, there is no need for circuit or macromodel simulation, but a direct algebraic approach where the objects being manipulated are noise characterizations.

For example, we seek the continuous output distribution of a D/A converter, the bit error rate of a receiver, or the output code distribution of an A/D converter.

Reference-contexts: Since the N -bit digital output code is a logic function of N successive outputs of the comparator, we seek the probabilities for each of the 2 N possible output codes given a deterministic input. 3 Previous work Traditionally, analog circuit noise is analyzed with the SPICE simulator <ref> [6] </ref>. The circuit is linearized at the operating point, and the noise is computed by solving the AC equivalent circuit, where the noise is represented by a sinusoidal source in parallel to the noisy elements. The problem with using this approach for mixed-mode systems are two-folded.

Reference-contexts: First, in mixed-mode systems, the comparator has a discontinuous transfer function and cannot be linearized. Secondly, mixed-mode systems are usually non-steady state (e.g. an A/D produces an output code after a finite time), so an operating point does not exist for the circuit. Simulators such as <ref> [7] </ref> can analyze noise in switched-capacitor circuits using linear systems theory, but unfortunately, it cannot handle noise in mixed-mode switched-capacitor circuits because mixed-mode circuits are highly nonlinear. Without simulators for noise effects, designers resort to the Monte Carlo noise simulation technique.

Reference-contexts: If a simple digital decoder is used, the output code can be very different from the correct code, in which case the error is called a sparkle <ref> [9] </ref>. Because the output error probabilities are usually very small, (6:4 10 4 in this example), many simulations are needed in the Monte Carlo method to predict sparkles.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, using the direct noise computation method, we have modeled two flash A/D's, one with a simple thermometer-to-binary ROM decoder and one with a more advanced decoder. Effective comparator noise can be estimated from <ref> [10] </ref>. In this experiment, for convenience we set the standard deviation of the comparator noise to a quarter of the smallest input voltage step size. Input voltage is half of the full range input.
