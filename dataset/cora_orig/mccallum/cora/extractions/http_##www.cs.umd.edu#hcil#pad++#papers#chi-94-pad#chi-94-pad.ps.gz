Abstract: We have implemented an infinite resolution multimedia sketchpad as a base for exploring a stream-of-consciousness model of computation where information creating, sharing and retrieval becomes so intuitive that the interface becomes invisible. Motivation to pursue this came from work on Pad [4], which can be thought of as a kind of traditional sketchpad or windows environment in the sense that it is a general-purpose substrate for visualizing two dimensional graphics and text. But Pad also supports the radical notion of being infinite in extent and resolution. We implemented Pad++ to explore smooth zooming for navigation and to serve as a platform for multimedia authoring and information visualization. The ability to work with very large datasets has been a primary design consideration in the development of Pad++.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION The motivation for our work on multiscale interfaces is to move beyond windows, icons, menus, and pointers to explore interfaces that more effectively support navigation through complex sets of multimedia information <ref> [1, 2, 5] </ref>. One premise of our work is the belief that navigation in information spaces is best supported by tapping into our natural spatial and geographic ways of thinking [3]. Information can be entered interactively by the user or dynamically by a program on Pad++.

Information can be entered interactively by the user or dynamically by a program on Pad++. It can be placed at any location and at arbitrary scale. Navigation is performed by zooming in and out and moving around the surface.

Reference-contexts: One challenge in navigating through any lar ge dataspace is maintaining a sense of relationship between what you are looking at and where it is with respect to the rest of the data. The rough animation or jumpy zooming as implemented in the original Pad <ref> [4] </ref> can be disorienting and thus not provide the most effective support for the cognitive and perceptual processing required for interactive information visualization and navigation.
