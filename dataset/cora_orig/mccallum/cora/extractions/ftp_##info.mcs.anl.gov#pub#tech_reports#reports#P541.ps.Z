Reference-contexts: Lemma 2.3 The mapping p : IR 7! IR is continuously differentiable with p 0 Z (ffff l )= (ffff u )= ae (s) ds: (2:4) In particular, p 0 (ff) 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Furthermore, if supp (ae) = IR, then p 0 (ff) 2 (0; 1). Proof. <p> Since r 0 where D (x) = p 0 (xf (x)), we are led to the study of matrices of the form M = I D+DA, where D = diag (d i ) has d i 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Our results show a strong connection between the nonsingularity of M and the class of P and P 0 -matrices. <p> Theorem 4.4 Let D = diag (d i ) be a diagonal matrix with d i 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and set K = fi : d i = 1g; L = fi : 0 &lt; d i &lt; 1g: If the principal submatrix A K of A 2 IR nfin is nonsingular and A K [L =A K is a P 0 -matrix, then M = I D <p> Pang and Gabriel [17], More [15], Xiao and Harker [23, 24], Ferris and Ralph [10], and De Luca, Facchinei, and Kanzow [14] have introduced regularity conditions for the classical complementarity problem (1.2), while Gabriel [11], Billups <ref> [1] </ref>, and Billups, Dirkse, and Ferris [2] seem to be the only researchers that have used this type of regularity condition for mixed complementarity problems. Comparisons between these regularity conditions are difficult because they depend on the formulation of the complementarity problem as an optimization problem. <p> Proof. Any limit point of fr 0 k (x k )g is of the form I D + Df 0 (x fl ), where D = diag (d i ) has d i 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and thus the proof follows from Theorem 4.4 if we show that [f 0 (x fl )] K is nonsingular for K = fi : d i = 1g and that the matrix B = [f 0 (x fl )] K [L =[f 0 (x fl )] K ;

Reference-contexts: We consider a recent approach to the solution of the classical problem (1.2), introduced by Chen and Mangasarian <ref> [6] </ref>, that is based on smoothing a residual r : IR n 7! IR n associated with the complementarity problem. This approach has attracted attention because the numerical results of Billups, Dirkse, and Ferris [2] show that the smooth code, which is based on these ideas, has superior performance. <p> We show that if a regularity condition is satisfied, then any limit point of fx k g solves the mixed complementarity problem (1.1). Chen and Mangasarian <ref> [6] </ref> were only able to show that the limit points of the sequence were *-accurate solutions to the classical complementarity problem (1.2). The notation that we use is fairly standard. Unless otherwise noted, kk is the Euclidean norm. <p> Chen and Mangasarian <ref> [6] </ref>, following the work of Kreimer and Rubinstein [13], introduced a smooth approximation to the standard complementarity problem (1.2); we will show that the above definition extends their work to the mixed complementarity problem. <p> Chen and Mangasarian <ref> [6] </ref> approximated the function ff 7! ff + = max (0; ff) with the function q : IR 7! IR defined by q (ff) = 1 dt = 1 dt; (2:9) where ae is a density function with bounded absolute mean. <p> Proof. The substitution t = s shows that q (ff) = 1 dt = 1 as desired. Our development does not impose any restrictions on the density function ae. In contrast, Chen and Mangasarian <ref> [6] </ref> based much of their development on the density function ae (ff) = (1 + exp (ff)) 2 : In global optimization work, More and Wu [16] have shown that the normal density function has superior smoothing properties, but at present it is not clear if similar results will hold in <p> On the other hand, Chen and Mangasarian <ref> [6] </ref> obtain approximate solutions to the mixed complementarity problem (1.1) by solving the system of nonlinear equations 0 B @ x l q (x l w) 1 C A where q is the smooth function defined by (2.9).

Reference-contexts: A P -matrix (P 0 -matrix) can also be defined as any matrix for which all principal submatrices have positive (nonnegative) determinants. For additional information on P -matrices, see the book of Cottle, Pang, and Stone <ref> [7] </ref>. Our analysis of matrices of the form M = I D + DA hinges on the following result of Sandberg and Willson [22]. <p> We also need to know that the Schur complement of a P 0 -matrix is again a P 0 -matrix. This result is due to Chen and Harker [4, Lemma 2.3]. The Schur quotient formula (see, for example, Cottle, Pang, and Stone <ref> [7, pages 76-77] </ref>) shows that [f 0 (x fl )] I [B =[f 0 (x fl )] K = [f 0 (x fl )] I [B =[f 0 (x fl )] I = [f 0 (x fl )] K =[f 0 (x fl )] I : is a Schur complement of

Reference-contexts: Lemma 3.1 Let r : IR n 7! IR n be the residual (3.1). A vector x 2 IR n solves the mixed complementarity problem (1.1) if and only if r (x) = 0. Lemma 3.1 is a special case of a result of Eaves <ref> [8] </ref>, which formulates variational inequalities as a system of nonsmooth nonlinear equations. In the case of the mixed complementarity problem, the equivalence of (1.1) with r (x) = 0 is a direct consequence of the definition of the mid function.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, (1.3) always has approximate minimizers. We introduce the smoothing approach in Section 2. We relate this approach to the smoothed functionals introduced by Katkovnik (see, for example, Katkovnik and Kulchit-skii <ref> [12] </ref>) to approximate n-dimensional nondifferentiable functions in stochastic optimization. References and generalizations of this work can be found in the work of Rubin-stein [19, 20, 21]. Smoothing is also used in global optimization, but with the purpose of removing local minimizers of n-dimensional smooth functions.
