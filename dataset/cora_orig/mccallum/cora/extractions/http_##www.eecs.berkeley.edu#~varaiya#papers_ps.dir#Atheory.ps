Abstract: This paper presents a theory for automated traffic flow, based on an abstraction of vehicle activities like entry, exit and cruising, derived from a vehicle's automatic control laws. An activity is represented in the flow model by the space occupied by a vehicle engaged in that activity. The theory formulates TMC traffic plans as the specification of the activities and speed of vehicles, and the entry and exit flows for each highway section. We show that flows that achieve capacity can be realized by stationary plans that also minimize travel time. These optimum plans can be calculated by solving a linear programming problem. We illustrate these concepts by calculating the capacities of a one lane automated highway system, and compare adaptive cruise control and platooning strategies for automation. The theory permits the study of transient phenomena such as congestion, and TMC feedback traffic rules designed to deal with transients. We propose a "greedy" TMC rule that always achieves capacity but does not minimize travel time. Finally, we undertake a microscopic study of the "entry" activity, and show how lack of coordination between entering vehicles and vehicles on the main line disrupts traffic flow and increases travel time. Keywords: automated highway system, traffic flow models, capacity of automated high ways, traffic management

Reference-contexts: That is how the theory relates AHS performance to 1 Of course, this descriptive theory is used to design and prescribe ramp metering and other traffic management rules. 2 This activity model is inspired by the work in <ref> [1] </ref>. 2 characteristics of vehicle control and traffic management rules. We now introduce the two assumptions, which we call "one activity per section" and "safety needs space," that bind together activities, vehicles and highway. To fix ideas, we assume that the AHS has a single lane, with entrances and exits. <p> A rule must specify the speed in each section, and f , g in the sections 1 and I respectively. The rule for the last section g is obvious: v (t) = 10, and g (t) = <ref> [1 ] </ref>n (I; t). A reasonable speed rule for all other sections is to have the maximum possible speed (up to 10). Of course, what the maximum speed in section i turns out to be at any time depends on the space available in section i + 1.

Reference-contexts: Cruising in platoons of different sizes are considered different activities because the space needed per vehicle in a cruising platoon decreases with the platoon size. (See <ref> [2] </ref>.) The highway is divided into sections, and we will assume that a vehicle executes a single activity in each section through which it travels.

Reference-contexts: This assumption of "one activity per section" rigidly ties the spatial discretization of the highway into sections with the temporal discretization of movement into activities. Although not mathematically necessary, we adopt the one-activity-per-section assumption because it greatly simplifies the model description. (See <ref> [3] </ref> for a related modeling move to tie together spatial and temporal discretization.) While it is engaged in a particular activity, a vehicle's motion is governed by a feedback control law which ensures that this activity is carried out safely.

In current design proposals <ref> [8] </ref>, a "transition area" serves as interface between the two highways where vehicles undergo "check-in" and "check-out" and where vehicle control is transferred from driver to system upon entry to the AHS and from system to driver upon exit.
