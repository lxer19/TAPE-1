Abstract: Internetworks of the future will allow and promote universal access. Users will be able to access the network at a multitude of access points separated by significant geographic distance and many administrative boundaries. Without a single central authority, a new set of inter-domain security mechanisms is needed to allow users to venture into remote domains while inheriting privileges from their home domain. Solutions addressing this issue must take into account a somewhat contradictory security constraint that calls for strict separation of security domains in order to avoid sharing sensitive user-related security information. In this paper, we propose a generic approach for authenticating mobile users in remote domains that satisfies the domain separation constraint. The protocols described herein can be applied in different mobile-user environments including wireless networks and mobile user services on traditional wireline networks.

Reference-contexts: we take into account some usability concerns in order to minimize the burden on the user and provide a transparent user interface. 4.1 Initial Assumptions We assume that, when accessing the network in the home domain, the mobile user is authenticated with a traditional server-based authentication mechanism such as Kerberos <ref> [3] </ref> or KryptoKnight [4]. Users of every network domain are registered with that domain's Authentication Server (AS). The AS of a domain can be replicated or partitioned within the domain but the set of all partitioned and duplicated ASs represent a single domain-level authority.

The reason for choosing KryptoKnight is twofold: 7 a) Mutual Authentication Protocol A B &gt; &lt; &gt; b) One-Way Authentication Protocol A B &gt; * KryptoKnight protocols have a number of qualities that make them attractive to build on. <p> In other words, the protocol's purpose is to establish a temporary foreign residence for a travelling user.

A KryptoKnight-style key token <ref> [4] </ref>, in turn, is computed as: AU T H K rh (N r ; N h ; U ) L K ur . This construction insures that the key is protected from unauthorized disclosure.

Reference-contexts: An AS is typically co-located with the Mobile Data Intermediate System (MD-IS) in a service provider's domain. Mobile unit (M-ES, in CDPD parlance) authentication always involves contacting the AS in the unit's home domain. As shown in Figure 2, the authentication process begins with the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol <ref> [5] </ref>. As a result, the M-ES and the serving MD-IS come to share a secret key, K s . 3 Armed with K s , M-ES submits its credentials (encrypted with K s ) for authentication. The M-ES credentials consist of a triple: [N EI; ARN; ASN ].

Reference-contexts: AU T H K ab denotes an authentication expression based on the shared key K ab . It is always generated by the responding party (B in our case). This expression is computed as a result of applying a strong encryption function E, e.g., DES <ref> [6] </ref>, with K ab as the encryption key, over three inputs: two nonces (N ab ; N ba ) and the name of the message originator.

Reference-contexts: A change of K u in the home domain will invalidate any previously used K ur . If K u is a weak key, e.g., a password or a PIN, the authentication token (regardless of its construction details) is subject to verifiable-plaintext attack <ref> [8, 7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Hiding the algorithm is certainly contrary to the open-systems philosophy. Furthermore, the time-tried security-by-obscurity principle has not proven to be effective in preventing hostile attacks. 2 3.2 CDPD Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) architecture <ref> [13] </ref> has been recently developed by a consortium of several US-based companies. As the name suggests, it is oriented towards data, and not voice, traffic. CDPD takes advantage of free slots in cellular voice communication and uses them to transport data.

Reference-contexts: However, in the simplest mobile-user environment (e.g., UPT <ref> [14] </ref>), a user is "armed" with only a password or a PIN something that a human brain can easily retain. In summary, universal user certification is not sufficient or well-suited for establishing temporary residence in a foreign domain. <p> It is designed to provide universal user access and to support both fixed and mobile end-systems. The UPT design anticipates many types of fraudulent use and suggests some general solutions ranging from simple PIN-based authentication to more involved two-way authentication (user$UPT-equipment) using smartcards <ref> [14, 15] </ref>. Unlike GSM, UPT has not matured to a state where specific security solutions have been proposed. 4 Authentication of Mobile Users In this section we develop a generic solution for the authentication of mobile users. In doing so we try to avoid the drawbacks of GSM and CDPD.

Reference-contexts: Like UPT, it provides for network access through either mobile or fixed end-systems. However, it is not simply a value-added service but a complete architecture including, among other things, a MAC layer. The architecture supports several network layer protocols including IP [17] and CLNP <ref> [16] </ref>. Security services in CDPD are composed of data confidentiality, key distribution and mobile unit authentication. CDPD requires a logically-distinct entity Authentication Server (AS) to be present in every CDPD domain (area). An AS is typically co-located with the Mobile Data Intermediate System (MD-IS) in a service provider's domain.

Reference-contexts: There are many ways of constructing K ur in a manner that makes it dependent on the user's current location. For example, K ur can be computed as E K u [F (AS r ; U )] where F is a strong one-way hash function such as MD5 <ref> [19] </ref>. We can even avoid using encryption by computing K ur as F (AS r ; U; K u ).

Reference-contexts: CDPD, like GSM, uses an unpublished encryption function. As mentioned above, the initial key exchange is performed via Diffie-Hellman protocol. Subsequent traffic is encrypted using the (proprietary) RC4 encryption function <ref> [22] </ref>. 2 If the recent Clipper proposal is any indication, the GSM "secret" solution also fails to give an informed end-user a comfortable feeling of security. 3 There are actually two keys: K 0 and K 1 , both derived from K s .

In this case, all computation attributed to the user is actually performed by the access equipment on the user's behalf.
