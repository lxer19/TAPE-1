Abstract: Early routing protocols were based on distance vectors; they were very simple and easy to implement but had the severe drawbacks of counting to infinity and routing loops. These problems were reduced using such techniques as split horizon and hold-downs; however, for these techniques to work in practice, long convergence times are introduced. Routing protocols based on link states have been implemented to address the problem of slow convergence in distance-vector protocols, but they add complexity in configuration and troubleshooting. We present a new distance-vector protocol that converges as quickly as current link-state protocols, while maintaining loop freedom at every instant. The protocol is based on three main elements: a transport algorithm that supports the reliable exchange of messages among routers, the diffusing update algorithm, which computes shortest paths distributedly, and modules that permit the operation of the new routing protocol in a multiprotocol environment.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, in a link-state protocol a router must receive information about the entire topology to compute the shortest path to each destination using a local shortest-path algorithm such as Dijkstra's algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>. Each router broadcasts update messages, containing the state of each of the router's adjacent links, to every other router in the network. The distance vector protocols used in the Internet thus far are based on variants of the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm (DBF) for shortest-path computation [1]. <p> such as Dijkstra's algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>. Each router broadcasts update messages, containing the state of each of the router's adjacent links, to every other router in the network. The distance vector protocols used in the Internet thus far are based on variants of the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm (DBF) for shortest-path computation [1]. The primary disadvantage of DBF is that incorrect entries in routing tables may form routing-table loops for one or more destinations whenever link costs increase [9]. <p> If router i finds a feasible successor, it remains passive and updates its routing table entry as in DBF <ref> [1] </ref>. Alternatively, if router i cannot find a feasible successor, it first sets its distance equal to the addition of the distance reported by its current successor plus the cost of the link to that neighbor. The router also sets its feasible distance equal to its new distance.

Reference-contexts: a router employ one or more of the following techniques: * Telling its neighbor routers whether it uses them as successors to destinations (a technique called split horizon [3] [12] [14] [15] * Holding down the updating of its routing table for some period of time after detecting distance increases <ref> [2] </ref> * Sending update messages reporting an infinite distance to a destination in order to force neighbor routers to choose successors other than the router itself [15] However, none of these techniques solves DBF's performance problems satisfactorily in very large inter-nets, because exceedingly long convergence times can be incurred.

DUAL's treatment of a link-down event is described below. 4 DUAL DUAL is specified in detail in References <ref> [4, 5] </ref>; this section provides only a summary of its operation as it applies to EIGRP. Each router maintains a vector with its distance to every known destination in the routing table.

Information for the routing table is taken from the topology table. In addition, a link-state table is maintained that contains a list of all neighbors heard. This is used by the transport as well as DUAL. <p> Multiple changes in link cost or availability are handled by ensuring that a given node is waiting to complete the processing of at most one query at any given time. The mechanism used to accomplish this is specified in <ref> [5] </ref>, and is such that a node can be either passive or in one of four active states.
