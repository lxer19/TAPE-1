Reference-contexts: Written in terms of a matrix problem (there are no source terms) A u = 0; (2) where the m fi m matrix A (which itself is composed of matrices) is dense. Relaxation techniques are generally O (n 2 ) when not accelerated <ref> [1] </ref>, with the actual convergence rate being determined by the eigenvalues of the iteration matrix.

Reference-contexts: Since A is not guaranteed to be invertible or sparse, solving for requires dense matrix methods (such as calculating the pseudo-inverse of A) which are generally O (n 3 ) Baraff <ref> [2] </ref> has developed a method for solving acyclic systems of constraints in linear time. The Iterative Convergence method 1 exploits this property to allow cyclic problems to be iteratively solved in linear time.
