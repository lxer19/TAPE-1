Abstract: End-to-end protocols measure network characteristics and react based on their estimates of network performance. Network dynamics can alter the topology significantly, and thereby affect protocol operation. Topology changes may result in routing pathologies (such as route loops, packet interleaving), changes to the end-to-end path characteristics, network partition etc, that then impact the performance of end-to-end protocols. This paper presents methodologies to evaluate an end-to-end protocol in the presence of network dynamics using a simulator. A number of models of network dynamics are introduced. In the paper, we evaluate two end-to-end protocols over dynamic topologies and study the adaptivity of these protocols to topology changes. The first part of the paper illustrates the effect of packet interleaving on the performance of TCP. The second part of the paper is a systematic evaluation of the adaptive timer mechanisms in Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM). The timer mechanisms are evaluated under simple topology changes, as well as under network partition conditions. The paper concludes by posing a number of open research questions about the behaviour of different reliable multicast mechanisms when operating over dynamic topologies.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we look at some of the issues involved in studying transport protocols over dynamic topologies. We concentrate on the study of two protocols: TCP and SRM. TCP <ref> [17, 3] </ref> is a reliable transport protocol for unicast connections. TCP has been extensively studied, both via simulations and on operational networks. However, its detailed performance analysis in the presence of dynamic topologies has never been reported. <p> The simulation configuration above (topology + unicast routing) differs from <ref> [3] </ref> in two significant ways: (1) their topology has no alternate paths between the sources and sink though Node 4, and (2) they use Static routing to precompute the routes in the topology prior to simulation execution. <p> is even more critical to study aspects of end-to-end multicast protocols, such as error recovery or congestion control mechanisms. 6 It is generally the case that, if multiple packets in a window have been dropped, the TCP Reno sender ultimately waits for a retransmit timeout, and the initiates slow start <ref> [3] </ref>. 7 In this section, we evaluate a reliable multicast protocol: Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM). In SRM, active sources in a multicast group periodically send data to the group, as specified by the application.

Reference-contexts: [17] source adjusts its data rate based on its estimate of the available bandwidth and congestion; Receiver-Driven Layered Multicast (RLM) [14] requires a group member to estimate the level of congestion, and decide the amount of data that it can receive at any given time; in Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) <ref> [4] </ref>, every group member estimates the rtt to all other group members, for use in its error recovery mechanisms. <p> Shankar et al.[19] in analyzing different routing protocols, describe the impact of network dynamics on the throughput and delay of a simple window based transport protocol. Individual protocol designers sometimes suggest how their protocol should perform in the presence of topology changes <ref> [4] </ref>; however, we know of no systematic study of the performance and evaluation of end-to-end protocols over dynamic topologies. In this paper, we look at some of the issues involved in studying transport protocols over dynamic topologies. We concentrate on the study of two protocols: TCP and SRM. <p> In SRM, active sources in a multicast group periodically send data to the group, as specified by the application. Each unit of data is identified by the tuple hsource id, message sequence numberi; this corresponds to the notion of naming in Application Data Units model used in <ref> [4] </ref>. The source tags each unit of data with its unique identifier. In addition, every member of the group periodically sends session messages specifying the amount of data it has received from each source. <p> This topology is a very simple model of a network with alternate paths for fallback (or fallback paths). Such fallback paths are used in the event of failure of some of the other paths in the network. When the topology is stable, our topology resembles a string topology <ref> [4] </ref>. These topologies stress the deterministic component of the SRM timers. There are other topologies that stress other aspects of the protocol, or model more realistic topologies. We have left the studies on these other topologies for future study. <p> An alternate measure, used in <ref> [4] </ref>, is to normalize the recovery delay at a node, and express it in units of that node's rtt. In particular, for any given loss, we determine the last node to receive the repair, and normalize the delay experienced by that node its estimate of the rtt to the source. <p> On the other hand, we can see from Figure 9 (b) that the delay is within 1rtt for that node, when the nodes use adaptive timers. These figures illustrate some of the original motivation in <ref> [4] </ref> for developing adaptive timer mechanisms, i.e., to reduce the recovery delay, at the expense of a marginal increase in the number of duplicate requests.

Reference-contexts: Our work is an ongoing exploration of the full range of SRM behaviour, and in this context, the results in this section are only the tip of an iceberg. Several other reliable multicast protocols such as Transport for Reliable Multicast (TRM) [18] and Deterministic Timeouts for Reliable Multicast (DTRM) <ref> [6] </ref>, use timer mechanisms similar to SRM. The results and methods that we have described in this section could apply to these protocols. 21 4 Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we have looked at the impact of network dynamics on TCP and SRM.

Reference-contexts: Common to all of these protocols is that changes to the topology can significantly change the actual network characteristics, and therefore impact the performance of the protocol, and possibly adversely affect the network. Paxson <ref> [16] </ref>, through end-to-end measurements of routing stability, tells us that in general, the stability of a particular end-to-end path is fairly high (around 60%); i.e., if, at a given instant in time, an end-to-end transport session uses a particular route from end-to-end, then there is a 60% likelihood that the session <p> More recently, Labovitz et al.[9], through measurements of inter-domain route updates at various network access points, suggests that there are a far greater number of route updates than is to be expected in a network, the size of the Internet. Paxson <ref> [16] </ref> also points out a number of routing and network pathologies that adversely affect TCP performance. By design, multi-party protocols and applications support a greater number of participants; they are used to communicate simultaneously with participants connected by diverse network paths.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction and Related Work A number of transport and application level protocols measure and react to network characteristics, such as the end-to-end delay, available bandwidth, rtt, congestion, etc. A TCP <ref> [17] </ref> source adjusts its data rate based on its estimate of the available bandwidth and congestion; Receiver-Driven Layered Multicast (RLM) [14] requires a group member to estimate the level of congestion, and decide the amount of data that it can receive at any given time; in Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) [4], <p> In this paper, we look at some of the issues involved in studying transport protocols over dynamic topologies. We concentrate on the study of two protocols: TCP and SRM. TCP <ref> [17, 3] </ref> is a reliable transport protocol for unicast connections. TCP has been extensively studied, both via simulations and on operational networks. However, its detailed performance analysis in the presence of dynamic topologies has never been reported. <p> TCP <ref> [17] </ref> is a unicast transport protocol that guarantees ordered reliable delivery of data. There are a number of studies of TCP in the literature. Fall et al.[3], in particular, has compared different flavours of TCP over stable topologies.

Reference-contexts: idea of using scaled session messages such that nodes consume a limited amount of bandwidth when sending session messages, attempt to limit the scope of their session messages, and at the same time designate a representative node to send more frequent session messages to the entire multicast group, bears promise <ref> [20] </ref>. 3.3 Recovery after Partitions In the previous sections, we considered protocol behaviour when the topology was stable (Section 3.1), and when the topology was dynamic, but continuously connected (Section 3.2). In this section, we study protocol behaviour when the topology is dynamic, and results in occasional network partitions. <p> We conjecture that there will be significant impact of network dynamics in the design of reliable multicast protocols. In particular, these protocols exploit locality in different ways, so as to improve their scalability without compromising their adaptivity. For example, scalable session messages mechanisms <ref> [20] </ref> choose representative members that will send global session messages on behalf of members in the vicinity. This involves making locality decisions about the topology, to decide the representative, and the group associated with that representative. <p> Other reliable multicast protocols use a combination of mechanisms to exploit locality. These mechanisms fall into four broad classes. (1) Designated representatives can act as proxy on behalf of members in the vicinity <ref> [10, 8, 20, 1, 2, 7] </ref>. (2) Topologically contiguous members that share a common characteristic, such as errors due to malfunctioning link, or congestion, can form a local group to recover from the effects of that characteristic, (3) some mechanisms form a hierarchy as an additional means of scaling [8, 10, <p> These mechanisms are designed to automatically adapt to the environment in which they operate. Examples of such self-configuration mechanisms include local error recovery groups [11], scalable session messages <ref> [20] </ref>, or designating a representative [15, 1, 2]. These self-configuring mechanisms have to cope with group membership changes, as well as topology changes. Therefore, these mechanisms, by definition, should reconfigure when there is a significant change, either in group membership or topology changes.
