Abstract: We report on our preliminary studies of a new controller for a two-link brachiating robot. Motivated by the pendulum-like motion of an ape's brachiation, we encode this task as the output of a "target dynamical system." Numerical simulations indicate that the resulting controller solves a number of brachiating problems that we term the "ladder", "swing up" and "rope" problems. Preliminary analysis provides some explanation for this success. We discuss a number of formal questions whose answers will be required to gain a full understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.

Reference-contexts: This result follows from direct computation, and we refer the reader to <ref> [8] </ref> for the details. <p> Again we refer the reader to <ref> [8] </ref> for details of the proof of Proposition 3.3. Thus, we conclude that any feedback law, t , which respects S, solves the ladder problem, assuming we can find a d such that [ c (d); 0 ] T 2 N . <p> The details of the nu merical procedure is discussed in <ref> [8] </ref>. We plot in Figure 3 a particular instance of ^ for the case where the robot parameters are l = 1; m 1 = 3; m 2 = 1. <p> However, if d and ! are not "matched" as ! = (d), then the trajectory ends in the ceiling, T q 2 T C + , with _ = 0 but r 6= d and _r 6= 0. We have found from our numerical studies <ref> [8] </ref> that when d = d fl + ffi for small ffi, then _r at T q 2 T C + is also small. <p> In general, even with exact calibration data, our observations suggest that the approach taken in this pa per works well only when roughly ! / 1 p l larger than m 2 . Under these circumstances, we present more numerical evidence in <ref> [8] </ref> that the proposed algorithm is practically feasible in terms of the required actuator torque and power.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we propose in this paper a control algorithm which is effective for the first two "slow brachiation" problems|i.e. the ladder and swing up and rope problems.

Although the ape's moment of inertia varies during the swing according its change of posture, the motion of a simplified pendulum gives a fairly good approximation.
