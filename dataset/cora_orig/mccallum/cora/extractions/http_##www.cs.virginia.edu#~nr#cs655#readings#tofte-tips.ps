Reference-contexts: Datatype Constructors Applying a datatype constructor con to a value v constructs a new value, which can be thought of as the value v fused with the "tag" con. (Nullary datatype constructors can be thought of as standing for just a tag.) Example 8.2 The expression <ref> [1] </ref> is short for 1 :: nil, which in turn means the same thing as op ::(1, nil). In principle, the evaluation of [1] creates four values, namely 1, nil, the pair (1;nil) and the value :: (1;nil). ut 9 Patterns For every way of constructing values (see Sec. 8) there <p> of as the value v fused with the "tag" con.

In principle, the evaluation of [1] creates four values, namely 1, nil, the pair (1;nil) and the value :: (1;nil). ut 9 Patterns For every way of constructing values (see Sec. 8) there is a way of decomposing values. The phrase form for decomposition is the pattern.
