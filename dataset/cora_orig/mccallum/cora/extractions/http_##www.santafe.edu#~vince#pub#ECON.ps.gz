Abstract: We propose a method for modelling economic systems in which outcomes depend locally on the predictions that agents make of other agents. We develop population games in which each agent adaptively searches for a good model of its environment. We demonstrate that such systems can exhibit persistent dynamics, cyclic oscillations between low and high complexity states, and other complex, yet endogenous, phenomena. We propose these `adaptively rational' agents as a natural extension of rational expectations, suitable when mutual consistency is not realistic. We discuss the connections between our work and the programs of bounded rationality, evolutionary game theory and models motivated by statistical mechanics.

Reference-contexts: The inherent dynamicity of the system will normally de-stabilise any potential static equilibria. Such phenomena are observed in many realms in the real world, and an interesting paradigm for their study has developed from the work of Per Bak <ref> (Bak et al., 1987) </ref>. 5.1 Mean-field approach A standard approach from which to begin an analysis of such lattice systems is the mean-field approximation. We can apply this whenever the system's constituent parts interact in a primarily local fashion.

Reference-contexts: Its action is a weighted sum of its personal preferences (to carry out `D') and the influence of its neighbours (to coordinate). This kind of strategy is more naturally considered in the realm of social interaction and discrete choice (see <ref> (Brock and Durlauf, 1995) </ref> for such a model with local interactions). This last game may also be considered a `dominant Nash equilibrium' case of the coordination game. It is mathematically identical to the game in Bray's study of adaptive price formation (with = b and a = (1 )D).

Reference-contexts: These scenarios are portrayed in figure 2. The techniques used to perform the minimisations are singular-value decomposition (details to be given (Darley, 1997)). Let us note, however, that numerical stability factors <ref> (Press et al., 1992) </ref> mean that it is actually better to solve the minimisation problem rather than differentiating the above equations and solving the subsequent equalities exactly.
