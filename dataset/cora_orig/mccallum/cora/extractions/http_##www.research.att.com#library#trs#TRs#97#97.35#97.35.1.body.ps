Title: A modest proposal for preventing Internet congestion  
Author: Andrew Odlyzko 
Date: September 3, 1997  
Affiliation: AT&T Labs Research  
Abstract: A simple approach, called PMP (Paris Metro Pricing), is suggested for dealing with congestion in packet networks such as the Internet. It is to partition a network into several logical networks, each of which would treat all packets equally on a best effort basis, just as the current Internet does. There would be no formal guarantees of quality of service. The separate networks would differ only in the prices paid for using them. Networks with higher prices would attract less traffic, and thereby provide better service. Price would be the primary tool of traffic management.

Reference-contexts: Flat rates are preferred by consumers, but they also have major advantages for service providers. They were already advocated for broadband services by Anania and Solomon in <ref> [AnaniaS] </ref>, a paper that was first presented almost a decade ago. <p> Other pricing proposals Several proposals have been made for usage-sensitive pricing. Extensive information can be found on the Web site [Varian0] and in the collection of paper edited by McKnight and Bailey (of which the reference <ref> [AnaniaS] </ref> below is one). Further references, short summaries, and criticisms can be found in [Clark1, Shenker1, ShenkerCEH]. Here I only make a few remarks on the main features of some of these proposals, and how they compare to PMP.

Reference-contexts: PMP would be easy to introduce. It would not be necessary to wait for the deployment of IPv6 [Huitema] or other protocols. The current IPv4 packets already have a 3-bit priority field that is unused. (It was used for only a brief period a decade ago <ref> [BohnBCW, Bailey] </ref>.) Since the number of networks in PMP is likely not to exceed 4, this is more than sufficient. Interoperability would be easy, as all packets that do not contain any bits indicating class of service could be sent on the lowest cost (and lowest priority) network. <p> Large organizations also show a strong preference for flat rates. The introduction by the U. S. Defense Data Network of usage-sensitive pricing resulted in the different branches of the U. S. armed forces building their own networks <ref> [Bailey] </ref>. This preference for flat rates is not unique to data networking. It is a general phenomenon that was probably first explored and documented in the context of pricing of local telephone calls in the Bell System in the 1970s [CosgroveL].

Reference-contexts: In general, flat-rate (or subscription) pricing is likely to be dominant in sales of information goods [BB, FishburnOS, Odlyzko, Var-ian1]. The conventional economic utility maximization arguments show that the advantages of bundling strategies (selling combinations of goods for a single price) increase as marginal costs decrease (cf. <ref> [BakosB] </ref>). Even sales of software are likely to be more profitable in the conventional arrangement of a fixed fee for unlimited use than on a per-use basis [FishburnOS]. However, all those predictions are for goods and services with negligible marginal costs.

Reference-contexts: There have been attempts to explain this phenomenon using conventional economic utility maximization arguments (cf. <ref> [BarroR] </ref>), but they are not entirely convincing. It seems likely that the cause lies more in the realm of consumers' seemingly irrational economic behavior, whose study was pioneered by Kahneman and Tversky.

Reference-contexts: Airlines mostly have either two or three classes of service. The basic version of PMP mentioned in the Introduction assigns to each subnetwork a fixed fraction of the capacity of the entire network. One can also use priorities. In the proposals <ref> [BohnBCW, GuptaSW2] </ref>, for example, packets with higher priorities would always be treated by a router before packets with lower priorities. The advantage of this approach is that the full gain from aggregating all traffic on one network would be obtained. <p> PMP would be easy to introduce. It would not be necessary to wait for the deployment of IPv6 [Huitema] or other protocols. The current IPv4 packets already have a 3-bit priority field that is unused.

Reference-contexts: It is desirable to provide incentives for users to either lower their load on the network or else switch to a higher-priced network when congestion occurs. Feng, Kandlur, Saha, and Shin [FengKSS1, FengKSS2, FengKSS3] have proposed implementing services such as controlled-load and guaranteed service (cf. <ref> [BradenCS] </ref>) without end-to-end network coordination. They use adaptive packet marking with two classes, with higher priority packets treated preferentially at the routers, to provide soft guarantees of QoS. They are not concerned with pricing as such, but appear to assume a variant of Clark's scheme of charging for expected usage.

Reference-contexts: Even without unintentionally defective or rogue implementations of TCP, the Internet is already threatened by the growth of services that use protocols such as UDP, which do not slow down transmission in the presence of congestion <ref> [BradenFM] </ref>. Usage-sensitive pricing could provide incentives for cooperative behavior. If every packet incurred a charge, sending two copies of a packet to cope with network losses would double the cost of the transmission, and induce marginal users to postpone or abandon their transmissions.

Reference-contexts: This is only to be expected with the current flat-rate scheme, since revenues depend only on the number of users. Consumer usage as well as satisfaction with good or services depend in large part on their subjective reactions to pricing schemes (cf. <ref> [Brittan] </ref>). In particular, while the arguments for usage-sensitive pricing seem to be irresistible, they run into users' seemingly immovable preference for flat rates. This preference has attracted considerable attention recently, especially 11 when America Online was forced to offer such a plan.

Reference-contexts: For example, Federal Express and United Parcel Service are moving towards charging for delivery of express mail according to distance, instead of using a flat fee. Even in Internet transmissions, there have been many instances of charging for the amount of transmitted data <ref> [Brownlee, OECD] </ref>. Such usage-sensitive pricing appears to be spreading for large customers in the U.S., with UUnet, MCI, and other carriers offering them. Many ISPs have declared that they intend to move away from flat rate pricing for individuals.

They propose imposing charges on packets when those packets contribute to congestion. In particular, charges would be zero when the network is not fully utilized. Their Vickrey auction mechanism has some desirable properties. However, as is pointed out in <ref> [Clark1, ShenkerCEH] </ref>, for example, it requires complicated systems to conduct an auction among individual packets (which, moreover, would be most involved in the core of the network, where simplicity is of highest value to obtain high speed of operation). <p> The Gupta et al. proposal [GuptaSW1, GuptaSW2, GuptaSW3, GuptaSW4] is (oversimplifying a lot) to have a set of service classes and priorities. As is pointed out in <ref> [Clark1, ShenkerCEH] </ref>, there are problems with this approach, among them that low priority classes could fail to get any bandwidth at all if enough traffic from higher priority classes show up. The scheme also has substantial overhead. It requires collecting and processing extensive information about the network. <p> The scheme also has substantial overhead.

Reference-contexts: It has impeccable economic logic as well as increasing practical evidence behind it. Unfortunately, it collides with users' unshakeable preference for flat-rate pricing. The problem is how to reconcile the two. The case for usage-sensitive pricing of the Internet has been ably made many times already, for example in <ref> [Clark2, GuptaSW4, MacKieMV1, MacKieMV2, Shenker1, Shenker2, ShenkerCEH] </ref>. The basic problem is that the demand for transmission capacity appears to be practically unlimited, especially as high bandwidth services are developed. This guarantees a continuation of the nearly constant congestion we are experiencing right now. <p> The scheme also has substantial overhead. It requires collecting and processing extensive information about the network. The schemes that are closest to PMP are those advocated by Clark <ref> [Clark1, Clark2] </ref> and Shenker et al.

Reference-contexts: As with most other pricing schemes, there are still areas requiring further research. For example, how should one charge for multicasting? (Cf. <ref> [HerzogSE] </ref>.) It would also be necessary to arrange for 800-like services, in which the receiver pays. These have already been considered in the literature, and the authenticated transactions required for them can also be carried out just by the service providers at the edges of the network. 5.

Reference-contexts: However, endemic congestion has led to wide dissatisfaction, and there is general agreement that new applications, especially real time ones such as packet telephony, will require higher quality of service. Various solutions to data network congestion are being developed, typically involving bandwidth reservation or priority setting. (See <ref> [Huitema, JordanJ, Keshav, Shenker2] </ref> for a discussion of some proposals and references.) Many of the proposed schemes are complicated, and involve substantial costs in both development and operations. Furthermore, since the basic problem is that of allocating a limited resource, any solutions will surely have to involve a pricing mechanism. <p> There are experts in the data networking community who argue that instead of working on complicated network schemes, all resources should be devoted to improving capacity (the "fat dumb pipe" model). (See p. 138 of <ref> [Huitema] </ref> and [Steinberg].) Technology is changing rapidly, and so there is an advantage to simple systems, since they can be developed and deployed much faster. As an example, for all the vaunted flexibility of ATM, it is currently being used primarily to provide "fat dumb pipes" [Steinberg]. <p> The intention in PMP is to reduce the traffic management task by inducing users to separate themselves into classes with different requirements. This would eliminate or at least reduce the need for approaches such as RSVP <ref> [Huitema, Keshav] </ref>, which violate the Internet's connectionless approach, and require complicated coordination across the network. <p> The PMP proposal would simply let each ISP offer its customers an array of choices that they might have available through different ISPs anyway, and should therefore be more efficient. PMP would be easy to introduce. It would not be necessary to wait for the deployment of IPv6 <ref> [Huitema] </ref> or other protocols. The current IPv4 packets already have a 3-bit priority field that is unused. (It was used for only a brief period a decade ago [BohnBCW, Bailey].) Since the number of networks in PMP is likely not to exceed 4, this is more than sufficient.

This appears to be the driving force behind the numerous proposals to provide quality of service guarantees. (See <ref> [JordanJ] </ref> for an overview and references.) However, it seems likely that the main problem is not the variability in quality of service on the Internet but the generally low quality of that service.

Reference-contexts: They also argue for at least some variant of Clark's proposal of charging for expected usage, with those portions of a consumer's offered load that deviate from negotiated statistics being treated at lower priorities. (This part is similar to another proposal of Kelly <ref> [Kelly] </ref>.) The problem with charging for negotiated usage profiles, just as with applications of future markets to networks, is that they do not deal with the inevitable short-term fluctuations in traffic.

Reference-contexts: However, endemic congestion has led to wide dissatisfaction, and there is general agreement that new applications, especially real time ones such as packet telephony, will require higher quality of service. Various solutions to data network congestion are being developed, typically involving bandwidth reservation or priority setting. (See <ref> [Huitema, JordanJ, Keshav, Shenker2] </ref> for a discussion of some proposals and references.) Many of the proposed schemes are complicated, and involve substantial costs in both development and operations. Furthermore, since the basic problem is that of allocating a limited resource, any solutions will surely have to involve a pricing mechanism. <p> However, allowing high priority packets to block completely lower priority ones violates the fairness criterion that appears to be important to consumers (see Section 5 for further discussion of this topic). A better approach might be to use weights in routing decisions, such as in the weighted round-robin technique <ref> [Keshav] </ref>. One could also use different approaches in different parts of the network. One can even mix these approaches on the same link. <p> The intention in PMP is to reduce the traffic management task by inducing users to separate themselves into classes with different requirements. This would eliminate or at least reduce the need for approaches such as RSVP <ref> [Huitema, Keshav] </ref>, which violate the Internet's connectionless approach, and require complicated coordination across the network.

Reference-contexts: However, such an argument is easy to question. For one thing, the maximal transmission rate through a node on the Internet under normal conditions is much less than the theoretical throughput. This is because data traffic is fractal <ref> [LelandTWW] </ref> (an observation that was first made in LANs, and has now been confirmed in many other data networks). This suggests that all data networks with heterogeneous sources will use only a fraction of their capacity, a considerably smaller fraction than the phone network does. There are further complications. <p> This should allow network operators to deduce what the distribution of consumer demands and valuations is. For the PMP proposal to work, the performance of the different networks has to be predictable, at least on average. Unfortunately, the fractal nature of data traffic <ref> [LelandTWW] </ref> means that we have to expect that all PMP channels will experience sporadic congestion. All we can expect is that the higher-priced channels will experience this service degradation less 8 frequently. This could lead to network instability, with degradation on one channel propa-gating to other channels.

There are regular workshops on Internet traffic measurement (see <ref> [NLANR] </ref> for pointers to these and other information sources), but the state of our ignorance about the Internet is astounding. The large network providers do not provide basic data on their total traffic or capacity utilization, and apparently many do not collect careful statistics. <p> With compression, much lower transmission capacity would suffice. Thus even in the phone network the measurement of capacity utilization is not easy.) On the Internet, capacity utilization is much harder to define. The statistics for the NSFNET compiled by Merit (and available through the links at <ref> [NLANR] </ref>) show that this backbone, towards the end of its existence, when it consisted exclusively of T3 lines, transmitted data at a rate that was only about 5% of the link capacity. <p> We do not know what the true capacity utilization was. There are also problems in interpreting current Internet statistics. For example, consider the 15-minute average throughput data for the PacBell NAP for the period Aug. 3, 1997 to Aug. 27, 1997, available through the links at <ref> [NLANR] </ref>. After removing the data for Aug. 14 and 15 (when apparently the entire NAP was down for a few hours), we find that the minimum transmission rate was 50.3 Mbs, maximum was 309.4 Mbs, average was 222.3 Mbs, 6 and the standard deviation was 48.0 Mbs. <p> This is again in contrast to the voice phone network, where there is little traffic on weekends. Similar utilization profiles apply to the other major switching points for which data is available at <ref> [NLANR] </ref>. One conclusion that could be drawn from these statistics is that the Internet is much more efficient than the voice phone network, with capacity utilization of over 70% as against 15-20%. However, such an argument is easy to question. <p> Most of it, though, appears to be caused by not satisfying existing and potential demand for data service. There is some data available through <ref> [NLANR] </ref> on packet loss rates, which are one indication of congestion. That is not the full story, though. Most of the Internet traffic is TCP, which uses variants of Van Jacobson's backoff algorithm (introduced in 1988 to prevent another collapse of the type that the Internet had suffered then).

Reference-contexts: This type of approach, referred to as "damaged goods," has been studied by Deneckere and McAfee [DeneckereM], who show that it is common in high-tech industries, and that it often serves to promote social welfare. (This approach appears to be especially suited for trade in information goods. See <ref> [Odlyzko, Varian2] </ref>.) Methods of this type could be used to induce a more even load on the separate networks, and thus compensate for some of the potential difficulties. 4. PMP implementation The PMP proposal can be regarded as a logical development of some current trends. <p> This is often true even when the user preferences mentioned above (which are hard to incorporate into conventional utility maximization arguments) are ignored. In general, flat-rate (or subscription) pricing is likely to be dominant in sales of information goods <ref> [BB, FishburnOS, Odlyzko, Var-ian1] </ref>. The conventional economic utility maximization arguments show that the advantages of bundling strategies (selling combinations of goods for a single price) increase as marginal costs decrease (cf. [BakosB]). <p> The challenge is to design pricing schemes that approach the goal of efficiency that can be achieved by auction mechanisms, and yet do respect consumer aversion to the auction. A particularly important role in consumer behavior in the economic and political arenas is played by the notion of fairness <ref> [Odlyzko, Zajac] </ref>. Fairness is likely to play an increasing role in electronic commerce. Decreasing marginal costs are increasing the incentives for sellers to impose artificial barriers, and at the same time the nature of electronic commerce makes it much more apparent to consumers that the barriers are artificial.

Reference-contexts: the voice phone network.) Some charges of these types would be expected to apply in addition to the usage-sensitive charges for PMP (but would be considerably lower than if there was no charge for data loads). (For a survey of different types of Internet access charges around the world, see <ref> [OECD] </ref>.) PMP would also not deal with some other problems where charging might be appropriate. The only effective way to deal with spam (massive junk email) may well be to impose charges for email delivery. <p> For example, Federal Express and United Parcel Service are moving towards charging for delivery of express mail according to distance, instead of using a flat fee. Even in Internet transmissions, there have been many instances of charging for the amount of transmitted data <ref> [Brownlee, OECD] </ref>. Such usage-sensitive pricing appears to be spreading for large customers in the U.S., with UUnet, MCI, and other carriers offering them. Many ISPs have declared that they intend to move away from flat rate pricing for individuals.

Further, there is no effective method to prevent the creation and use of rogue versions of TCP, which would speed up transmission of packets when they encounter delays or packet losses.

These require network nodes along the path of a transmission to coordinate their actions, and are thus "reinventing telephone technologies" <ref> [Steinberg] </ref>. The hope is that PMP would permit dispensing with measures such as RSVP and their complexity, and go back to the simpler model of the traditional Internet. PMP is also designed to be acceptable to users, who have a strong preference for flat-rate pricing.

Reference-contexts: The number of subnetworks in PMP should be small, possibly just two, but more likely three or four. Having few networks minimizes losses from not aggregating all the traffic, and also fits consumer preferences (discussed in Section 5) for simple schemes. Furthermore, it is known (cf. <ref> [Wilson] </ref>) that in many situations, most of the economic gains from subdivision into different classes of service can be gained with just a few classes. In other, somewhat 3 similar settings, a small number of classes of service has worked satisfactorily.

A particularly important role in consumer behavior in the economic and political arenas is played by the notion of fairness <ref> [Odlyzko, Zajac] </ref>.
