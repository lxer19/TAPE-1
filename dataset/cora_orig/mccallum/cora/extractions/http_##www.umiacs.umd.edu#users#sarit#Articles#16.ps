Reference-contexts: One of the presumed difficulties in using negotiation as a way of reaching mutual benefit is that negotiation is a costly and time-consuming process and, consequently, it may increase the overhead of coordination (see <ref> [1] </ref>). In the presence of time constraints, planning and negotiation time should be taken into consideration. The negotiation may be either about job sharing or resource allocation. <p> In both cases we want to prevent the agents from spending too much time on negotiation and therefore not keeping to their timetables for satisfying their goals. Research in DAI is divided into two basic classes: Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) and Multi-Agent Systems (MA) <ref> [1] </ref> (see discussion of previous work in DAI in Section 1.5 below).

Reference-contexts: task distribution problem in the area of Distributed Problem Solving systems includes, for example, Davis and Smith's work on the Contract Net [54], Cammarata et al.'s work on strategies of cooperation that are needed for groups to solve shared tasks effectively in the context of collision avoidance in air traffic <ref> [2] </ref>, Lesser and Erman's model of a distributed interpretation system that is able to function effectively even though processing nodes have inconsistent and incomplete information [31], and Carver et al.'s work on agents with sophisticated models that support complex and dynamic interactions between the agents [3]).

An example of task distribution is the "delivery domain" [60, 64, 49, 15]. A group of delivery companies can reduce their overall and individual delivery costs by coordinating their deliveries. Each delivery requirement is a single task. Delivery coordination is actually the exchanging of tasks.

A communications satellite is a good example of a shared resource, due to the high cost of its launching and maintenance. In many cases the only way a company can get access to a communications satellite is by sharing one with other companies.

Reference-contexts: This is a direct outgrowth of the serious consideration currently being given to agents operating in challenging, real-world environments. For many years, highly restricted domains were considered sufficient for AI research purposes, and agents such as Shakey <ref> [14] </ref> could be designed and built for operation in simplified, restricted environments. The research on agent architectures and on planning typically made several standard assumptions, including the existence of a static domain, the lack of deadlines, and the existence of a single agent, i.e., our agent.

Reference-contexts: We propose to develop a strategic model of negotiation that can serve as the basis for building efficient automated negotiators. The formal game theory approach is also divided into two central sub-approaches concerning the bargaining problem (see <ref> [20] </ref>). The first is the strategic approach. The agents' negotiating maneuvers are moves in a noncooperative game and the rationality assumption is expressed by investigation of the Nash Equilibrium. 3 The second approach is the axiomatic method.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we consider the problem where agreements involve all the agents. Multi-agent's negoiation mechanisms, in situations in which agents are free to form any coalition that includes some of the agents while exluding others, are discussed in <ref> [52, 62, 22] </ref>. Wellman ([60]) uses a market oriented approach for inter-agent coordination mechanism design ("market oriented programming"). When the agent interaction can be reduced to a simple consumer-producer relation a market pricing mechanism can be used to ensure efficiency and stability.

Reference-contexts: Rubinstein [47] and Sta _ hl [56] developed models of alternating offers, which take time into consideration. Shaked and Sutton [51] extended these works by developing models in which an agent can opt out of the game. Those works are closely related to our desired models (see <ref> [41] </ref> for a detailed review of the bargaining game of alternating offers). Nevertheless, several important modifications are needed. These mainly concern the way time influences the preferences of the agents, the possibility that both agents can opt out, and the preferences of the agents over opting out. <p> Nash equilibrium strategies may be in equilibrium only in the beginning of the negotiation, but may be unstable in intermediate stages. 4 See <ref> [41] </ref> for a detailed review of the bargaining game of Alternating Offers. 12 Nash equilibrium puts few restrictions on the outcome and also yields too many equilib-rium points (see ([47] for the proof). <p> We assume that negotiation time is expensive and taken into consideration by each agent. Even though the negotiation can continue indefinitely we will show that agreement will be reached without any delay. We utilize modified definitions from <ref> [41] </ref>. We assume that there is a set of agents A = f1; 2g. We present a formal definition of an agreement. Definition 1 Agreement: An agreement is an ordered pair (s 1 ; s 2 ), in which s i is agent i's portion of the resource. <p> The outcome is that agent 1 proposes x fl in the first period (period 0), and 2 immediately accepts this offer. Proof : The proof and additional discussion can be found in <ref> [41] </ref>. Even though the structure of the strategic model of Alternating Offers allows negotiation to continue indefinitely, in the unique subgame perfect equilibrium it terminates immediately. The exact agreement that will be reached depends mainly on the patience of the agents. <p> A simple way to avoid this asymmetry in the 18 model is the following (see <ref> [41] </ref>): at the beginning of each period each agent is chosen with probability 1 2 (independently across periods) to be the one to make the first offer. 3.2.2 Constant Cost of Delay In the second case, suppose the agents' utility function includes a constant cost of delay as defined in Definition

Reference-contexts: We assume that agents care only about the nature of the agreement, and the time at which the outcome is reached, and not about the sequence of offers and counteroffers that leads to the agreement, i.e., there is no "decision-regret" (see <ref> [42] </ref>). 3.1 The Agents' Utility Functions We also assume that agent i 2 A has a continuous utility function over all possible outcomes: U i : fS fi T g [ fDisagreementg !

Reference-contexts: There are two approaches to finding equilibria. One is the straight game theory approach: search for Nash or perfect or sequential strategies. The other is the economist's standard approach: set up a maximization problem and solve using calculus <ref> [43] </ref>. The maximization approach is straightforward and if the utility functions of the agents are chosen correctly, the maximization problem can be solved using some well known techniques of linear programming 53 (e.g., [55]).

Reference-contexts: In this paper we consider the problem where agreements involve all the agents. Multi-agent's negoiation mechanisms, in situations in which agents are free to form any coalition that includes some of the agents while exluding others, are discussed in <ref> [52, 62, 22] </ref>. Wellman ([60]) uses a market oriented approach for inter-agent coordination mechanism design ("market oriented programming"). When the agent interaction can be reduced to a simple consumer-producer relation a market pricing mechanism can be used to ensure efficiency and stability.

Reference-contexts: However, we don't make any assumptions about the offers the agents make during the negotiation as is the case in some other work (e.g., <ref> [63] </ref>). In particular, the agents are not bounded to any previous offers that have been made. Nevertheless, the negotiation ends with no delay. 1.5 Related Work in Economics and Game Theory There are two main approaches to the development of theorems relating to the negotiation process.
