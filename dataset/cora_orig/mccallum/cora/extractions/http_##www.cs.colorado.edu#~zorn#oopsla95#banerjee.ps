Title: Towards An Improved Evaluation Metric For Object Database Management Systems  
Author: Somnath Banerjee Charles Gardner 
Address: Instruments  
Affiliation: Texas  
Abstract: With the emergence of Object Technology, Object Oriented Database Systems are becoming increasingly important. However, there is very little information for users to evaluate these databases from the perspective of their own requirements. Based on the experiences of both traditional and Object databases, it is strongly felt that several features other than the mere performance are equally, if not more important in order to evaluate a Database system. These features include backup/recovery, online database compaction, multiuser support, clustering, security and automated monitoring. This paper first introduces the current benchmarks, discusses their limitations, then the so called 7 by 24 features are introduced for inclusion in a future OODBMS evaluation metric.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION We are witnessing a very interesting transition period. More and more computing environments are making the shift from monolithic mainframe architecture to a distributed Client/Server architecture <ref> [1] </ref>. Another key feature of this transition is the migration to Object Technology from traditional computing paradigms. Texas Instruments has been a pioneer in such migration. The 1 MMST/WORKS program was one of the first Object Oriented Computer Integrated Manufacturing system.

Reference-contexts: A key component of this change is an Object Oriented Data Base. The architects of this system realized early that a complete Object Orientation is desirable from the Client GUI end to the persistent object storage end <ref> [ 2] </ref>. In the process of this development and also as a result of prolonged interaction with the developers/maintainers of the traditional systems the authors of this paper have discovered what a PRODUCTION OODBMS should look like.

Reference-contexts: These items are a result of direct experience of OODBMS based development and deployment. 2. CURRENTLY AVAILABLE BENCHMARKS There are 3 currently available benchmark and performance measurement metrics. They are o Object Operation One o Hypermodel benchmark o Object Operation Seven Object Operation One <ref> [3] </ref> was the first of its kind and it provided excellent insight into the performance of OODBMSs vs. relational DBs highlighting the effects of pointer navigation and lack of foreign key references. Hypermodel benchmark provided a richer schema and wider operations.

Reference-contexts: Hypermodel benchmark provided a richer schema and wider operations. Finally, Object Operation Seven <ref> [ 4] </ref> introduced several key notions like complex objects, indexed vs nonindexed transactions, traversals with updates and so on. This benchmark has been both widely used and controversial among the OODBMS community . However, all of these benchmarks are focussed on evaluating the database performance while running an application.

Reference-contexts: Overall, our experience has been quite positive with our early decision to select an Object database. 5. TOWARDS A FUTURE OODBMS METRIC Some work has been accomplished to capture some of these features and perform a comparison <ref> [5] </ref>. However, the comparison seems to be subjective and lacks the preciseness presented in OO1 and OO7. There is no quantification of the features or capabilities.
