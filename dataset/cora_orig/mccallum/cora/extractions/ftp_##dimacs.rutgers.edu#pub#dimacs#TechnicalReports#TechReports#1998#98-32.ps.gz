Reference-contexts: To overcome this difficulty we apply an approach similar to the one used in <ref> [1] </ref> and construct the desired partition by a sequence of random halving steps. This is done using the following lemma.

Reference-contexts: Clearly ch (G) (G) for every graph G and it is well known that the inequality may be strict. It is not difficult to extend some of the results of this note to choice numbers. Thus, for example, using the technique of <ref> [2] </ref> it is not difficult to show that if G satisfies the assumptions of Theorem 2.1 and d (log n log log n) 1=* then the inequality ch (G) O (d=(* 3 log d)) (which is stronger than the assertion of the theorem) holds as well. - 7 - Indeed, as

Reference-contexts: Finally, let C v be the event that the set of good neighbors of v which have the same color as v spans more than 100=* 2 edges. We use the symmetric version of the Lovasz Local Lemma (see e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>) to prove that with positive probability no bad events happen. <p> Since the number of neighbors of any vertex v in G i ; i = 1; 2, is a binomially distributed random variable with parameters d (v) d and 1=2, it follows by the standard estimates for Binomial distributions (cf. , e.g., <ref> [3] </ref>, Appendix A) that for every v 2 V p d 2d 8 : To bound the probability of the event B v we use a large deviation inequality for martin gales. <p> Since for all vertices v 2 V the random variable jL v " X i j is binomially distributed with parameters O ( d * 3 log d ) and 1=k, then by a standard large deviation inequality (cf. , e.g., <ref> [3] </ref>, Appendix A) P r jL v " X i j O ( * 3 k log d ! ( d = e * log d ) 1 Therefore with positive probability no such event happens.

Reference-contexts: This upper bound can be improved if the graph has sparse neighborhoods, namely, if no subgraph on the set of all neighbors of a vertex spans too many edges. The first instance of a result of this type is Brooks' Theorem <ref> [4] </ref>, which asserts that if no neighborhood contains 2 edges (that is, if G contains no copy of the complete graph on d + 1 vertices), then (G) d.

Reference-contexts: Proof of Proposition 1.2. It is well known (see, e.g., [9], <ref> [5] </ref>) that there is an absolute constant C so that for every integer there is a triangle-free graph G on m vertices with maximum degree containing no independent set of size at least Cm log =: (In fact the above holds even for graphs with arbitrarily large girth; for large the

Reference-contexts: Molloy and Reed [12] proved that for every * &gt; 0 there is some ffi &gt; 0 such that if no neighborhood contains more than (1 *) 2 edges, then (G) (1 ffi)(d + 1). Johansson <ref> [6] </ref> proved that if each neighborhood contains no edges at all (that is, if G is triangle-free), then (G) O (d= log d). Our main result in the present note is the following. Theorem 1.1 There exists an absolute positive constant c such that the following holds. <p> Then the chromatic number of G is at most O (d=(* 3 log d)). Our proof relies heavily on the following result of Johansson <ref> [6] </ref> mentioned in the introduction. Proposition 2.2 ([6]) If G is a triangle-free graph with maximum degree d then (G) O ( log d - 2 - We need the following lemma. Lemma 2.3 Let * &gt; 0 be a fixed real. <p> to show that if G satisfies the assumptions of Theorem 2.1 and d (log n log log n) 1=* then the inequality ch (G) O (d=(* 3 log d)) (which is stronger than the assertion of the theorem) holds as well. - 7 - Indeed, as proved by Johansson in <ref> [6] </ref>, the choice number of any triangle-free graph with maximum degree d is at most O (d= log d). <p> most c H d= log d. - 8 - Some version of this conjecture is suggested in [7], where it is shown that it almost holds: the chromatic number of any graph G as above is at most c H d log log d= log d: Note that Johansson's result <ref> [6] </ref> stated as Proposition 2.2 here shows that the conjecture holds for H = K 3 , and Corollary 2.4 shows it holds for all graphs H containing a vertex v such that H v is bipartite.

Reference-contexts: A graph is d-degenerate if any induced subgraph of it contains a vertex of degree at most d. It is easy and well known that each such graph is (d + 1)-colorable (see, e.g., <ref> [8] </ref>, page 8). However, it turns out that for every d there is a triangle-free d-degenerate graph G d whose chromatic number is d + 1. This is trivially true for d = 1. Assuming it holds for d 1, we prove it for d, d 2.

Reference-contexts: For each vertex u of G the induced subgraph G [N (u)] on the neighborhood of u contains no copy of the bipartite graph H v. Thus by the known results on Zarankiewicz's problem (see, e.g., <ref> [10] </ref>, Problem 10.37) the number of edges in G [N (v)] is at most d 24* for some fixed * = *(H).

Reference-contexts: Clearly P r [B v ] 2d 12* * ( d 1* ) * &lt; d 3 : To bound the probability of C v we need the following simple observation. If a graph has more than 100=* 2 edges than by Vizing's theorem <ref> [13] </ref> it either has a vertex of degree at least 9=* or a matching with at least 9=* edges.
