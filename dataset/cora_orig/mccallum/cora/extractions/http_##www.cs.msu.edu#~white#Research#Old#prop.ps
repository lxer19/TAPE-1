Reference-contexts: It is vital to insure that no critical knowledge is lost during the translation. This is the approach to reengineering that we will explore in the course of this research. Hierarchical Coloured Petri Nets (HCP-nets) <ref> [1] </ref> are an extension of the well known Petri Nets. The functionality of the original Petri Nets, used for the representation of concurrent systems, has been expanded to allow for the hierarchical specification of systems in a more concise and powerful model.

Reference-contexts: In contrast to the simple Petri net token, each HCP-net token can carry complex information. Effectively, a single token may contain the entire state of the system at a given time. HCP-nets also allow functionality to be associated with transitions. In 1985, Joseph Kljaich presented his thesis <ref> [2] </ref>, which contained several transformation rules designed to raise the level of abstraction in flow nets (modified Petri Nets). One of the first steps that must be taken is to prove the mathematical soundness of these transformation rules; the functionality of the HCP-net must be unaffected.
