Title: Relating the Provable Collapse of P to NC 1 and the Power of Logical Theories  
Date: 00, 19xx  
Note: DIMACS Series in Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science Volume  
Abstract: Stephen Cook Abstract. We show that the following three statements are equivalent: QPV is conservative over QALV, QALV proves its open induction formulas, and QALV proves P = NC 1 . Here QPV and QALV are first order theories whose function symbols range over polynomial-time and NC 1 functions, respectively.

Reference-contexts: There are several possible choices for QALV. The one we select is a quantified version of Clote's equational theory ALV 0 [Clo93]. Other possibilities could be based on Pitt's quantifier-free theory T 1 [Pit96], or Arai's first-order theory AID <ref> [Ara91] </ref>. It may turn out that all these theories are essentially equivalent, but so far this is an unproven conjecture. 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 03F30; Secondary 68Q15, 03F20. <p> In the case of NC 1 concepts, several authors have results. Clote [Clo90, Clo93] showed that the theorems of his equational theories ALV and ALV 0 corre spond to tautology sequences with polynomial size Frege proofs. Arai <ref> [Ara91] </ref> did the same for the b 0 theorems of his first order theory AID and Pitt [Pit96] did the same for his quantifier-free theory T 1 . <p> QPV is 8 b 1 -conservative over AID. 2.

Reference-contexts: A possible disadvantage of ALV 0 is that the proof that its function symbols represent all NC 1 functions rests on Barrington's theorem <ref> [Bar89] </ref>, which involves an interesting construction using unsolvable groups. Thus functions as simple as the majority function require relatively complex definitions, and proofs of their properties appear to be complex. <p> ALV 0 is similar to PV, except that the function symbols range over NC 1 functions instead of polynomial time functions. The NC 1 function symbols are introduced in a manner based on Barrington's characterization of NC 1 in terms of bounded width branching programs <ref> [Bar89, BIS90] </ref>, and adapted by Clote [Clo93] to show that the NC 1 functions are the least class including certain initial functions and closed under composition, concatenation recursion on notation, and K-bounded recursion on notation (for constant K).

Reference-contexts: Analogous principles are known for the problem of separating Frege and constant-depth Frege systems.

Some of these, including the Odd-town theorem, seem to require linear algebra for their proofs.

Reference-contexts: The theory QPV considered here is a quantified version of the author's equational theory PV [Coo75], in which the function symbols represent the polynomial time functions. PV is well-studied [CU93, Kra95a], and in particular Buss <ref> [Bus86] </ref> showed that the theorems of PV are inter-translatable with the b 1 theorems of S 1 2 . The theory QALV is some analog of QPV for the NC 1 functions; i.e. the functions computable by uniform log depth polynomial size circuit families. <p> In fact the usual order properties can be proved in QALV, and in particular QALV proves t = u $ :t &lt; u ^ :u &lt; t (trichotomy).

It follows from the proof of Theorem 4.7 of [CU93] that all of Buss's <ref> [Bus86] </ref> BASIC axioms for S 1 2 are provable in QPV.

If QALV proves 8~x9yA (~x; y), where A (~x; y) is a b 0 formula, then there is a QALV function symbol f such that QALV proves 8~xA (~x; f (~x)). The same holds when QPV replaces QALV throughout.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The motivation for this paper comes from two sources. First, building on a result of Krajicek , Pudlak , and Takeuti [KPT91], Buss <ref> [Bus95] </ref> and Zambella [Zam96] independently proved that the bounded arithmetic hierarchy of theories S i 2 collapses if and only if the polynomial time hierarchy provably collapses. <p> We prove that the arithmetic theory QPV of polynomial time functions is conservative over the arithmetic theory QALV of NC 1 functions if and only if P provably collapses to NC 1 . (QPV is called PV 1 in <ref> [Bus95] </ref>.) The second motivation is an attempt to relate the possible collapse of P to NC 1 with the possible p-simulation of extended Frege propositional proof systems by Frege systems. <p> The hard part of the proof of our main theorem (Theorem 7) is showing that if QALV proves its open induction formulas, then P = NC 1 , and this equality is provable in QALV. At a high level, our proof resembles Buss's <ref> [Bus95] </ref> proof that if S 1 2 (PV) = QPV, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Buss's proof is based on the KPT witnessing theorem [KPT91], applied to a 898 formula. Our proof is based on a simpler traditional witnessing theorem, applied to a 89 formula (induction). 2.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless it remains an open question whether QALV (quantified ALV 0 ) is equivalent, for example, to AID. A fundamental open question in propositional proof complexity is whether Frege systems can efficiently simulate extended Frege systems <ref> [CR79, Kra95a] </ref>. Intuitively this question is related to the question of whether P = NC 1 , since formulas in a Frege proof represent NC 1 concepts and formulas in an extended Frege proof represent polynomial time concepts. However, no formal relation between the two questions has been proven.

The function symbols of PV stand for polynomial time computable functions (members of FP), and every such function is represented by infinitely many function symbols. <p> If f is an initial function of ALV 0 but not of PV, then f is either s or j j. Both of these functions are easily defined in PV. In fact, referring to <ref> [CU93] </ref>, s is defined in D24 and its ALV 0 defining equations follow from T26, and jxj is defined in D133 and its ALV 0 defining equations follow from T135. We use these definitions to define s and j j . <p> We will show in the next section that QALV cannot prove the b 0 induction formulas unless P = NC 1 . It follows from the proof of Theorem 4.7 of <ref> [CU93] </ref> that all of Buss's [Bus86] BASIC axioms for S 1 2 are provable in QPV. Thus in view of Theorem 5 the arguments in chapter 6 of [Bus86] apply to show that QPV proves all of the b 1 theorems of S 1 2 . 2.5. Witnessing in QALV. <p> By the induction hypothesis, PV 0 ; E j= cond (t; v; u) = u. Using appropriate substitution instances of the PV theorems cond (x; y; y) = y and cond (x; cond (x; y; z); w) = cond (x; y; w) (see T4, p123 of <ref> [CU93] </ref>), by the equality axioms we conclude PV 0 ; E j= cond (t; u; v) = cond (t; cond (t; v; u); v)(28) = cond (t; v; v) = v:(29) The other two rules are handled similarly. (The reasoning is similar to the justification of DR13 and DR14 of [CU93].) <p> <ref> [CU93] </ref>), by the equality axioms we conclude PV 0 ; E j= cond (t; u; v) = cond (t; cond (t; v; u); v)(28) = cond (t; v; v) = v:(29) The other two rules are handled similarly. (The reasoning is similar to the justification of DR13 and DR14 of [CU93].) Lemma 3. If PV 0 ; E; t = 1 j= u = v then PV 0 ; E; tr (t) = 0 j= cond (t; u; v) = u, for any PV terms t, u, and v. <p> Proof: As in the proof of the above lemma, we proceed by induction on the derivation of u = v via R1, R2, and R3. The induction step is the same as the justification of DR12, DR13, and DR14 in <ref> [CU93] </ref>. The interesting part of the base case is when u = v is t = 1. For this we need the PV theorem cond (tr (x); cond (x; 1; x); 1) = 1:(30) This can be proven by Conditional Induction on x (DR17 of [CU93]), with a secondary induction to <p> DR12, DR13, and DR14 in <ref> [CU93] </ref>. The interesting part of the base case is when u = v is t = 1. For this we need the PV theorem cond (tr (x); cond (x; 1; x); 1) = 1:(30) This can be proven by Conditional Induction on x (DR17 of [CU93]), with a secondary induction to take care of the induction step s 1 (x)=x. From (30) we conclude PV 0 ; tr (t) = 0 j= cond (t; 1; t) = 1, as required. Lemma 4.
