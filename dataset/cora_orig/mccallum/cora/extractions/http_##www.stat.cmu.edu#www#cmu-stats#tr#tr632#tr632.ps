Title: ETHICS, OBJECTIVITY, AND POLITICS: STATISTICS IN A PUBLIC POLICY CONTEXT  
Author: Stephen E. Fienberg

Abstract: Federal statistical agencies in the United States have long prided themselves on their independence and their ability to produce data in a neutral fashion. Yet even when their data are intended to serve national needs, the mandate to collect such data for most agencies comes from the political arena, i.e., from Congress or from politically-appointed federal administrators. This paper focuses on a series of problem areas where substantial political pressures have imperiled the collection and dissemination of quality statistical information of material importance: quality control and the welfare system, underenumeration and the decennial census, the extent and consequences of the AIDS epidemic, and employment discrimination litigation. Statisticians need to be aware that this pressure exists and to develop professional mechanisms to help our governmental colleagues recognize unreasonable pressure and resist it.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we often neglect to note the extent to which the social eugenics movement influenced Galton, Pearson, and Fisher (see e.g., MacKenzie, 1981; Porter, 1986), or racism affected Walker's leadership of the decennial census <ref> (e.g., see Anderson, 1987) </ref>. To a large extent this may not matter at all, but I believe that there are contexts where it does. A few examples may suffice to make the issue clearer.

Reference-contexts: For example, in 1991, Senator Jesse Helms argued that the proposed sex survey was not intended to stop the spread of AIDS, but to compile supposedly scientific evidence that homosexuality is "just another normal lifestyle." A committee of the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences reported <ref> (Auerbach et al., 1994) </ref>: Serious gaps remain in the information available on the prevalence of behaviors that put people at risk for HIV.

Reference-contexts: A few examples may suffice to make the issue clearer. Consider Fisher's 1918 formulation of the intra-class correlation coefficient, a tool he intended to be used in the study of heredity <ref> (for details, see Bennett, 1983) </ref>. The same paper included Fisher's first articulation of the analysis of variance, one of his greatest technical contributions. For me, such contributions to mathematical statistics and genetic contributions can stand on their own, unfettered by the eugenics views that often served as their stimulus.

Reference-contexts: Because of the linkage of AIDS with intravenous drug usage, aspects of statistical measurement were also bound up in that administration's "war on drugs." <ref> (Booth, 1988) </ref>. Although federal research funds for medical research on AIDS increased dramatically following the change in administration in 1988, prejudice and political pressure with regard to the collection of statistical information remained.

Reference-contexts: The panel's 1985 report <ref> (Citro and Cohen, 1985) </ref> outlined the basic issues that needed to be addressed in the adjustment research program. Subsequently, the panel reviewed the proposed methodology developed by the Census Bureau staff for adjustment in 1990, and its implementation in two separate pretests.

Reference-contexts: It attempted to choose among alternative concepts of what we mean by poverty and how various sources of income and expenditures should be represented in it, while recognizing that "there is no scientific basis by which one concept can be indisputably preferred to another" <ref> (Citro and Michael, 1995, p.3) </ref>. In the end the panel made a choice, and it also recommended using data from the newer Survey of Income and Program Participation rather than the CPS.

Reference-contexts: The revised figures were based heavily on data from the Kinsey survey of sexual behavior (conducted about 40 years ago) whose statistical quality is questionable at best <ref> (e.g. see Cochran, Mosteller, and Tukey, 1953) </ref>, and data from San Francisco on infection among homosexual and bisexual men.

Reference-contexts: In 1989, the funding of the proposed survey was approved by the National Institutes of Health but the Office of Management and Budget withheld approval of the survey questionnaire because of the complaints from several congressmen and senators who branded the survey as "pornographic" <ref> (Dannemeyer 1989) </ref>. Yet the social and moral dimensions of problems surrounding the AIDS epidemic are critical to an understanding of what statistical data to collect and how to interpret them.

Reference-contexts: such data will not be used for partisan political purposes?

Reference-contexts: The two links with the other examples are the extra-technical considerations for statisticians testifying in such adversarial proceedings and yet another CNSTAT study, by its Panel on Statistical Assessments as Evidence in the Courts <ref> (see Fienberg, 1989b) </ref>. <p> What becomes clear from an examination of actual Title VII cases <ref> (see Fienberg, 1989b) </ref> is that the very nature of the adversarial system draws the expert witness away from neutrality and objectivity. The process begins with the briefing of the expert by counsel who invariably presents the facts of the case from the perspective of the client.

Reference-contexts: This point comes up again and again in different agencies and with different data systems. Few politicians and administrators recognize the need to protect statistical data from regulatory uses <ref> (see the related discussion in Fienberg, 1994a) </ref>. In addition, the sanction system is based only on overpayment errors rather than on overpayment and underpayment errors as well as improper denials.

Reference-contexts: Again the results were impressive. Participation rates were as high as in Pittsburgh: the screening response rate for occupied households was 98%, and, for those containing an eligible sample person, 84% gave a blood sample and completed the questionnaire. Thus the overall response rate was 84% <ref> (Horvitz et al., 1990) </ref>. The nonresponse follow-up component provided data that were used to construct separate logistic regression models for men and women that allowed informative adjustments 19 for non-response (Massey et al., 1990).

Reference-contexts: In part, they feared that the public debate would affect data collection in CDC's non-probability sample of "sentinel hospitals and other surveillance programs" (see the description in Stoto, 1989, and Turner, Miller, and Moses, 1989). But such data known to be subject to extreme nonresponse biases <ref> (e.g., see Hull et al., 1988) </ref> and thus many statisticians, including the present author, viewed the sentinel programs as of marginal quality and value at best, with or without additional nonresponse. The pilot test for NHSS was later implemented in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, although in a less elaborate form.

Reference-contexts: Starting from a different social perspective we might easily be led to use a different battery of questions and come up with what is in effect a different definition of the unemployment rate.

Reference-contexts: I would argue that statisticians who collect data mandated by others can, at best, attempt to remain "disinterested" and impartial, but they certainly cannot uncouple their efforts from societal values and perspectives. Moreover, once produced, statistical data "enter the political fray on behalf of social interests" <ref> (Prewitt, 1987, p. 262) </ref> and thus the statistician's job does not end with the production of impartial reports or data summaries.

Reference-contexts: Thus they are especially appropriate for inclusion in a volume in his honor. Moreover, Richard has worked on and thought hard about aspects of such major public policy issues such as the accuracy of the decennial census <ref> (e.g. see Savage and Windham, 1973, and Savage, 1980, 1982) </ref>. For me, as for Richard, immersion in these problems occurred as part of committee and panel activities at the National Research Council (NRC) and especially its Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT). <p> For many readers this issue is certainly not new <ref> (e.g. see Hauser, 1973, Savage, 1985) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The purity of the mathematical formulation of statistical ideas often vanishes once we actually measure phenomena in the real world and attempt to set our analyses into an interpretive context. But this does not mean that statisticians should abandon statistical principles in such contexts, but rather the reverse <ref> (e.g., see Spencer, 1985 and Spencer and Moses, 1990) </ref>. 6 Acknowledgements An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Journal of Official Statistics and that material has undergone major revision, editing and updating.
