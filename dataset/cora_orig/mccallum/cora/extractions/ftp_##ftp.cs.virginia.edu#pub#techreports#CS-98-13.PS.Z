Abstract: Investigation of the transformations of vector spaces, whose most abstract formulations are called matroids, is basic in mathematics; but transformations of discrete spaces have received relatively little attention. This paper develops the concept of transformations of discrete spaces in the context of antimatroid closure spaces. The nature of these transformations are quite different from those encountered in linear algebra because the underlying spaces are strikingly different. The transformation properties of "closed", "continuous" and "order preserving" are defined and explored. The classic graph transformations, homomorphism and topological sort, are examined in the context of these properties. Then we define a deletion which we believe plays a central role in discrete transformations. Antimatroid closure spaces, when partially ordered, can be interpreted as lattices. We show that deletions induce lower semihomomorphisms between the corre sponding lattices. fl Research supported in part by DOE grant DE-FG05-95ER25254.

Reference-contexts: It is much better to begin with a closure operator, ', as one's paradigm because transformations can be wildly misbehaved. In fact, probably the best definition of chaos is given in terms of transformations <ref> [1] </ref>. There is ample scope for misbehavior because we observe that if U and U 0 are sets of n elements each, there exist only n n distinct functions f : U ! U 0 compared to (2 n ) 2 n transformations U f ! U 0 .

Reference-contexts: A lattice morphism L f ! L 0 is said to be a lower semihomomorphism, or LSH, if for all x; z 2 L, (x^z):f = x:f ^z:f and x x_z; z x_z together imply (x_z):f = x:f _z:f . Properties of lower semihomomorphisms can be found in <ref> [12] </ref>. 7 Corollary 3.15 If (U; ') p ! (U 0 ; ' 0 ) is a single point deletion then L (U;') ! L (U 0 ;' 0 ) is a lower semihomomorphism when restricted to the sublattice of closed subsets. <p> spaces are completely determined by just this sublattice. (The generators, Y:fi, of any closed subset Y can be determined by examining the closed sets covered by Y .) We therefore say that deletions induce a lower semihomomorphic transformation of one closure space onto another. 7 We caution the reader that <ref> [12] </ref> assumes that all lattices, which are called G-lattices, are atomic, that is, all singleton elements are closed. This is a characteristic of all convex geometries, but need not be true in general. <p> But, single point deletions can be composed. Figure 13 illustrates the composition of c with d . Note the sublattice [; c; d; cd] of (U; ') which maps onto of (U 0 ; ' 0 ). Following <ref> [12] </ref>, we call this the kernel of the deletion . If X and Z are in the kernel of a deletion, then because is a semimodular homomorphism, X^Z must be in the kernel, and X_Z is in the kernel if and only if it covers both X and Z.

Reference-contexts: It is far more interesting. Based on the deletion concept, one can now define families of antimatroid closure spaces. An early, but inadequate, attempt to do this in terms of "convex" graph homomorphisms can be found in <ref> [14] </ref>. In essence, except for some simple, common closure spaces such as n 27 independent, unrelated points, or n totally ordered points, the lattice structure of different closure operators appear to be quite distinct. For example, let U consist of n points which have an arbitrary partial order on them.

Reference-contexts: For example, there exist at least 202 distinct closure spaces comprised of 5 elements.
