Abstract: A laminar flamelet description is derived for premixed laminar flames. The full set of 3D instationary combustion equations is decomposed in three parts: (1) a flow and mixing system without chemical reactions, described by the momentum, enthalpy and element conservation equations, (2) the G-equation for the flame motion and (3) a flamelet system describing the inner flame structure and the local mass burning rate. Local fields for the flame curvature and the flame stretch couple the flamelet system with the flow and flame motion. To derive an efficient model, the flamelet equations are analyzed in depth, using the Integral Analysis, first introduced by Chung and Law [4]. It appears that the flamelet respons is governed by algebraic equations describing the influence of flame stretch on the local mass burning rate, the enthalpy variation and element composition. Known expressions for the mass burning rate, found by Joulin, Clavin and Williams are recovered in some special cases. Furthermore, the validity of the expressions has been shown for weak and strong stretch by comparing the results with numerical results of lean stretched premixed methane/air flames, computed with skeletal chemistry. Finally, the theory is illustrated for the tip of a 2D stationary Bunsen flame.

Using the Integral Analysis <ref> [4] </ref>, the structure of the flamelet equations is analysed further in Sections 4, 5 and 6. The system is studied for the case of zero stretch in Section 4. It appears that the enthalpy and element mass fractions are conserved and an expression for the mass burning rate is derived. <p> First, however, we study the above system analytically in Sections 4, 5 and 6. More specifically, we will compute the mass burning rate m b for both stretchless flames (K = 0) and stretched flames (K 6= 0), using the Integral Analysis <ref> [4] </ref>. This analysis might lead to more accurate approximations for both laminar and turbulent flamelet models. 4 Mass Burning Rate of Stretchless Flames Let us first study the case of stretchless flames, i.e. K = 0. Note that flames may still be curved when K = 0. <p> The @ @H 0 (ln m 0 b )-term in the right-hand side is related to the effect of preferential diffusion on the local enthalpy, leading to a change in the mass burning rate on its turn. Both terms appear in the analysis of Chung and Law <ref> [4] </ref> for the case of a simple one-step reaction. The last term, proportional to @ @Z 0 (ln m 0 also arises from differential diffusion effects, which give rise to element composition and stoichiometry changes.

The stabilization of this flametip was studied by computing the local stretch rate and the Karlovitz number. <p> In <ref> [7] </ref> we already saw that the effects of preferential diffusion on the burning velocity are smaller than 10%, because the effective Lewis numbers are close to 1. This is in accordance with results of the previous section.
