Title: H3: Laying Out Large Directed Graphs in 3D Hyperbolic Space  
Author: Tamara Munzner, 
Affiliation: Stanford University  
Abstract: We present the H3 layout technique for drawing large directed graphs as node-link diagrams in 3D hyperbolic space. We can lay out much larger structures than can be handled using traditional techniques for drawing general graphs because we assume a hierarchical nature of the data. We impose a hierarchy on the graph by using domain-specific knowledge to find an appropriate spanning tree. Links which are not part of the spanning tree do not influence the layout but can be selectively drawn by user request. The volume of hyperbolic 3-space increases exponentially, as opposed to the familiar geometric increase of euclidean 3-space. We exploit this exponential amount of room by computing the layout according to the hyperbolic metric. We optimize the cone tree layout algorithm for 3D hyperbolic space by placing children on a hemisphere around the cone mouth instead of on its perimeter. Hyperbolic navigation affords a Focus+Context view of the structure with minimal visual clutter. We have successfully laid out hierarchies of over 20,000 nodes. Our implementation accommodates navigation through graphs too large to be rendered interactively by allowing the user to explicitly prune or expand subtrees.

Reference-contexts: These numbers may seem surprisingly small to members of the visualization community, and serve to illustrate the difficulty of finding an aesthetic layout of a general graph.

Several systems devoted to Web visualization draw on the techniques of graph drawing and use abstract node-link diagrams in two dimensions.

We do automatically cull text labels when nodes move far from the origin. The user can also toggle the display of nontree links which enter or leave selected nodes.

Reference-contexts: There are two standard projections which map all of hyperbolic space into a ball in euclidean space. The projective model preserves straight lines and distorts angles, while the conformal ball model preserves angles and warps lines. The 2D hyperbolic browser developed at Xerox PARC uses the conformal ball model <ref> [LRP95] </ref>. We use the projective model in our implementation and in the layout derivation in the Appendix. Transformations in the 3D projective model can be expressed as 4 fi 4 matrices, so we use that model to gain maximum performance. <p> The original PARC cone tree system [RMC91] also used explicit gardening, but this approach is inferior to the automatic subtree expansion and collapse featured in systems such as the PARC 2D hyperbolic browser <ref> [LRP95] </ref> or Carriere's cone tree extension [CK95]. We do automatically cull text labels when nodes move far from the origin. The user can also toggle the display of nontree links which enter or leave selected nodes. We distinguish incoming from outgoing nontree links to allow fine-grained control of the display.

However, motion of an object constructed with hyperbolic geometry is very different from the motion of a euclidean object.

(The webviz browser <ref> [MB95] </ref> didn't have labelled nodes, could handle up to 50 peripheral nodes and show information about up to 500 fringe nodes.) Another big advantage of moving from a 2D tree to a 3D graph is the ability to see non-tree links in context.

Reference-contexts: The mapping from projective to conformal coordinates is straightforward, so our layout algorithm could be adapted for a conformal browser. A good discussion of hyperbolic transformations for use in computer graphics can be found in <ref> [PG92] </ref>, so we do not discuss navigation details in this paper. We show a diagram of a one-dimensional version of the projective model in Figure 5. We project from the hyperbola to a line segment tangent to the pole of the hyperbola that stretches between the asymptotes.
