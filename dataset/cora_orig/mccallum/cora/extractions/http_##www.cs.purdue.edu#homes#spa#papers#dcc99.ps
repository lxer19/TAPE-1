Abstract: Preliminary Results Abstract In this paper, we present a lossy data compression scheme based on an approximate two dimensional pattern matching (2D-PMIC) extension of the Lempel-Ziv lossless scheme. We apply the scheme to image and video compression and report on our theoretical and experimental results. Theoretically, we show that the so called fixed database model leads to suboptimal compression. Furthermore, the compression ratio of this model is as low as the generalized entropy that we define in the paper. We use this model for our video compression scheme and present experimental results. For image compression we use a growing database model for which we provide an approximate analysis (which will be presented in the final version of the paper). The implementation of 2D-PMIC is a challenging problem from the algorithmic point of view. We use a range of novel techniques and data structures such as k-d trees, generalized run length coding, adaptive arithmetic coding, and variable and adaptive maximum distortion level to achieve good compression ratios at high compression speeds. We demonstrate bit rates in the range of 0:25 0:5 bpp for high quality images and data rates in the range of 0:15 0:4

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Lossless data compression based on exact pattern matching can be traced back to seminal papers of Lempel and Ziv [18, 19]. More recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in extending these schemes to lossy data compression (cf. <ref> [1, 2, 3, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17] </ref>). This can be largely attributed to the rapid growth in digital representation of multimedia (e.g., text, audio, image, video, etc.) which is particularly amenable to exact and approximate pattern matching manipulations.

This can be largely attributed to the rapid growth in digital representation of multimedia (e.g., text, audio, image, video, etc.) which is particularly amenable to exact and approximate pattern matching manipulations. <p> Therefore, one must consider different distortion measures. This is in contrast with current state-of-the-art, where a different approach is used for compressing each of these types of data. Using the theoretical underpinning of Luczak and Szpankowski [13], Atallah, Genin and Sz-pankowski <ref> [2] </ref> implemented a lossy scheme for image compression. This scheme, called Pattern Matching Image Compression (PMIC), was based on one-dimensional pattern matching enhanced with some salient features. It was shown that for high quality images PMIC scheme is competitive with JPEG and wavelet image compression up to 1 bpp. <p> This is particularly important for video applications since current schemes (e.g., AVI, QuickTime, MPEG) require significant software support on the decompression side. The rest of this section addresses distortion level design, growing heuristic, pixel encoding, lossless encoding and video encoding. 3.1 Variable Distortion In the original PMIC (cf. <ref> [2] </ref>) we used square error distortion uniformly over an image, that is, D was fixed. We call this uniform distortion, and set D to be equal to RandomNoise to indicate that lossy compression can be viewed as adding "noise" to the image.

This can be largely attributed to the rapid growth in digital representation of multimedia (e.g., text, audio, image, video, etc.) which is particularly amenable to exact and approximate pattern matching manipulations. <p> We believe that the first practical implementation of lossy image compression based on approximate pattern matching (i.e., a combination of vector quantization and lossy LZ78) was reported by Constantinescu and Storer <ref> [3] </ref>. Unfortunately, no theoretical justification was provided for their scheme and experimental results were largely preliminary. Thus a natural question arose whether such a scheme is asymptotically optimal, like its lossless Lempel-Ziv counterpart. <p> The next step is to encode the pixels located on the right and below using a point that we call the anchor point. The selection of the next anchor point is called growing heuristic (cf. <ref> [3] </ref>). The growing heuristic we adopt is the "wave-front": from the top to the bottom of the image. Other examples of growing heuristics are a circle that expands outward from the center, thickening the main diagonal, etc. (cf. [3]). <p> The selection of the next anchor point is called growing heuristic (cf. <ref> [3] </ref>). The growing heuristic we adopt is the "wave-front": from the top to the bottom of the image.

These heuristics give very similar results. 3.3 Pixel Encoding The growing heuristic supplies anchor points that refer to the area to be encoded. <p> Furthermore, we should observe that we do not match patterns exactly, rather in an approximate sense. Consequently, we need a range search not an exact search. To speed up the search process, we use k-d trees (cf. [5]) in a manner similar to the one suggested in <ref> [3] </ref>. We describe some salient features of our implementation here. <p> Our implementation of the k-d tree methods follows the idea of <ref> [3] </ref>.
