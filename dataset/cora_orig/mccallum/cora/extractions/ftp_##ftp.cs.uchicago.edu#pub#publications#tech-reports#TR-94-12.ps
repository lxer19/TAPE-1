Title: Semi-unbounded fan-in circuits: Boolean vs. arithmetic

Abstract: We prove that polynomial size semi-unbounded fan-in Boolean circuits of depth d can be simulated by polynomial size semi-unbounded fan-in arithmetic circuits of depth O(d + log n), where the arithmetic operations +, , fi are performed in an arbitrary finite field. It is impossible to achieve this via gate-by-gate simulation. Instead, the proof is based on a randomized reduction to "unique witnesses" in the spirit of Valiant, Vazirani [VV], Mulmuley, Vazirani and Vazirani [MVV] and Wigderson [W].

Let us assign integer weights to the elements of V uniformly and independently from [1; 2jV j].

Reference-contexts: Let us assign integer weights to the elements of V uniformly and independently from [1; 2jV j]. Then with probability 1=2, all minimum weight sets in F have the same support. 5 We note that Nisan <ref> [N] </ref> proved that the Isolation Lemma holds for mul--tisets as well if we allow larger weights depending on the maximum multiplicity. Let G be a partial circuit of the circuit C, and suppose that the edges of C have been assigned weights.
