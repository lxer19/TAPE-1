Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for animation that can achieve the intricacy of motion evident in certain natural ecosystems with minimal input from the animator. The realistic appearance, movement, and behavior of individual animals, as well as the patterns of behavior evident in groups of animals fall within the scope of the framework. Our approach to emulating this level of natural complexity is to model each animal holistically as an autonomous agent situated in its physical world. To demonstrate the approach, we develop a physics-based, virtual marine world. The world is inhabited by artificial fishes that can swim hydrodynamically in simulated water through the motor control of internal muscles that motivate fins. Their repertoire of behaviors relies on their perception of the dynamic environment. As in nature, the detailed motions of artificial fishes in their virtual habitat are not entirely predictable because they are not scripted.

Reference-contexts: We achieve the nontrivial patterns of behavior outlined in the introductory paragraph of this paper, including schooling behaviors as convincing as those demonstrated by Reynolds, in stages. First, we implement primitive reflexive behaviors, such as obstacle avoidance, that tightly couple perception to action <ref> [3] </ref>. Then we combine the primitive behaviors into motivational behaviors whose activation depends also on the artificial fish's mental state, including hunger, libido, etc. Behavior is supported by perception as much as it is by action.

Reference-contexts: The repertoire of behaviors working in conjunction with the perception and motor subsystems makes the artificial fish an autonomous agent. In this regard, our design of virtual agents is compatible with recent work in robotics aimed at the implementation of physical agents (see, e.g., the compilation <ref> [6] </ref>). Interestingly, as our holistic computational model exceeds a certain level of physical, motor, perceptual, and behavioral sophistication, the agent's range of functionality broadens due to emergent behaviors, not explicitly programmed, but nonetheless manifest as the artificial fish interacts with a complex dynamic world inhabited by other artificial fishes.

Reference-contexts: Primitive behavior routines, such as obstacle avoidance, and more sophisticated motivational behavior routines, such as mating, implement the artificial fish's repertoire of behaviors. 2 Physics-Based Fish Model and Locomotion Studies of the dynamics of fish locomotion show that most fishes use their caudal fin as the primary motivator <ref> [18] </ref>. Caudal swimming normally uses posterior muscles on either side of the body, while turning normally uses anterior muscles. To synthesize realistic fish locomotion we have designed a dynamic fish model consisting of 23 nodal point masses and 91 springs. <p> The swim-MC produces straight swimming while the left-turn-MC and right-turn-MC execute turns. The MCs operate directly on the mechanical model by prescribing muscle contractions. The swimming MC controls the swimming segment muscles (see Fig. 2), while the turning MCs control the turning segment muscles. According to <ref> [18] </ref>, the swimming speed of most fishes is roughly proportional to the amplitude and frequency of the periodic lateral oscillation of the tail, below certain threshold values. Our experiments with the mechanical model match well with these observations. <p> Moreover, the swim-MC produces periodic muscle contractions in the posterior swim segment which lag 180 degrees behind those of the anterior swim segment; hence the mechanical models displays a sinusoidal body shape as the fish swims, as illustrated in <ref> [18] </ref>. By experimenting, we have found a set of four maximal parameters, ^r 1 , ^s 1 , ^r 2 and ^s 2 , which produce the fastest observed swimming speed. The swim-MC generates slower swim speeds by specifying parameters that have values between 0 and the maximal parameters. <p> As mentioned earlier, most fishes use their anterior mus-cles for turning, and the turn angle is approximately proportional to the degree and speed of the anterior bend, up to the limit of the fish's physical strength <ref> [18] </ref>. The artificial fish turns by contracting and expanding the springs of the turning segments (Fig. 2) in similar fashion. For example, a left turn is achieved by quickly contracting the left side springs of the segments and relaxing those on the right side.

Reference-contexts: The pectorals can be held close to the body to reduce drag and increase speed or they can be extended in order to increase drag and so serve as a brake <ref> [20] </ref>. Some reef fishes use a pectoral swimming style to achieve very fine motion control when foraging, including backwards motions, by keeping their bodies still and using their pectorals like oars. The artificial fish has a pair of pectoral fins which enable it to navigate freely in its 3D world. <p> The pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the mouth produces a vacuum force that sucks into the mouth the victim and anything else in the nearby water. The predator closes its mouth and expels the water through the gills and grinds the food with pharyngeal jaws <ref> [20] </ref>. We simulate this process by enabling the artificial fish to open and close its mouth kinematically. <p> Each fish constantly adjusts its speed and direction to match those of other members of the school.
