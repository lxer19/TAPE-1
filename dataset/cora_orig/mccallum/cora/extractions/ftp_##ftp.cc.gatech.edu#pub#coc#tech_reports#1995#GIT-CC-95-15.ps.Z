Abstract: Multicast routing is an important topic of both theoretical and practical interest. Some recently-proposed multicast routing algorithms involve the designation of one or more network nodes as the "center" of the routing tree for each multicast group address. The choice of this designated router (which we refer to as the "core") influences the shape of the multicast routing tree, and thus influences performance of the routing scheme. In this paper we investigate the relationship between the choice of core and three performance measures. Specifically, we compare various methods of selecting a core with respect to their effect on bandwidth, delay, and traffic concentration. We conclude that simple methods are adequate for widely distributed groups, but that the addition of group information can be leveraged to improve performance especially when the group is small or exhibits a high degree of locality. We also conclude that core choice has a significant impact on traffic concentration, in fact traffic concentration effects can be ameliorated by appropriate core choice policies.

Reference-contexts: Why, then, are other methods for constructing routes being considered in recent multicast routing schemes such as Core-Based Trees <ref> [1] </ref> and Protocol Independent Multicast [2, 3]? Among the reasons are reduction in router storage and control message overhead; both of these issues are addressed by the use of center (or core)-based trees, in which the choice of a designated router determines the shape of the multicast routing tree.

We demonstrate that traffic concentration is not inherent in the core-based tree approach; rather it is sensitive to core choice and can be virtually eliminated (if desired) by choosing cores at random. To measure traffic concentration, we model a large number of connections in the same network.

Reference-contexts: receiver in a multicast group. (We use the term "source" to designate an originator of multicast information and the term "receiver" to designate a recipient of multicast information.) Further, shortest-path trees can be constructed relatively easily in a distributed fashion, using information that is available for shortest path, unicast routing <ref> [4, 6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Shortest path trees have an additional disadvantage if bandwidth is of importance. A shortest path tree does not generally minimize bandwidth, and in some cases can lead to poor bandwidth utilization in order to achieve minimum delay. Minimizing bandwidth requires solving the NP-complete Steiner tree problem <ref> [5] </ref>, and thus is probably not a practical alternative. As we will see later, core-based trees can sometimes offer improvement in bandwidth utilization over shortest path trees.

Reference-contexts: We analyze the performance of various methods on multicast instances, and use the results to give recommendations on core choice method.

The work by Wei and Estrin [8, 9] begins to address the relationship between core choice and performance by also considering cores chosen optimally from amongst the group members.

To demonstrate that traffic concentration is influenced (and can be alleviated) by core choice, we also compute the link load when the core for each group is chosen at random from all nodes in the graph. Figure 17 shows this result.
