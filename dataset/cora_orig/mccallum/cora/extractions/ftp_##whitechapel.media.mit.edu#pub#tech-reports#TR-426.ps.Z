Reference-contexts: Simon-ton reported a life span extension of over 60% for patients enrolled at his center during 16 its first four years [30]. Achterburg and Lawlis also studied a group of patients enrolled in the Simonton's program and found consistently better results for patients that practiced imagery daily <ref> [1] </ref>. Achterburg argues, in fact, that the imagery itself is the important therapeutic component in the healing program. In a broader study, Spiegel, et. al., demonstrated that psychosocial interventions (which included group therapy and self-hypnosis) almost doubled survival time in the experimental group compared to the control group [34].

Reference-contexts: Memmesheimer and Eisenlohr followed this study with a more controlled experiment showing a similar connection between the cure of warts and suggestion [22]. In the 1950's, another series of studies probed the issue of hypnotizability and warts <ref> [21, 12, 2, 3, 38] </ref>. Though these studies focused on the relationship between hypnotizability and efficacy of hypnotherapy, the idea that warts were susceptible to hypnotic suggestion (which usually entails extensive use of imagery) was reinforced.

Reference-contexts: The Sensei system tackles the first problem, that of gesture recognition, through a Hidden Markov Model approach. The user's head and hands are tracked in 3-D via STIVE (Stereo Interactive Video Environment) <ref> [4] </ref>. Cartesian (dx; dy; dz) velocities are used as features, and and left-right, Bakis HMM's [26] for each gesture are trained with the Baum-Welch algorithm. Recognition is achieved in real-time with the use of the Viterbi algorithm. The five gestures used in the system can be seen in Figure 1-1. <p> In the smart desk environment of STIVE, two wide-baseline cameras are positioned at the top of a large display screen in front of which sits the user. The video from each camera is separately analyzed to find two-dimensional blob features <ref> [4] </ref>. Essentially, this task is accomplished by searching the video input stream for flesh chrominance and then using a geometry model to decide which blob corresponds to the left hand, the right hand, and the head.

Reference-contexts: In their study, twenty adults used an APPLE IIc program and rated their anxiety via the Spielberger State Anxiety Scale. They found that the computer was an adequate tool for assisting adults in relaxation and stress-reduction <ref> [5] </ref>. In summary, there is a wide range of work showing that imagery and relaxation are beneficial to the function of the immune system. Furthermore, the vividness of the imagery experienced by the practitioner correlates most strongly with how effective hypnosis and imagery are in curing warts.

Reference-contexts: Several other researchers have shown relaxation and imagery to be an effective means of reducing stress and anxiety in cancer patients, without studying the specific effect on long-term survival <ref> [28, 15, 14, 18, 10, 31, 6] </ref>. Post-white has not only shown the positive effects of imagery on emotion, immune function, and cancer outcome, but has shown that it causes an increase in lymphokine activated killer cells [24].

Reference-contexts: This sense of control itself, even if not directly correlated to prognosis, certainly improves the quality of life. Because imagery and relaxation promise so much benefit to both those with and without cancer, Becker and Pentland are developing a virtual reality imagery and relaxation tool called Staying Alive <ref> [7] </ref>. The long term goal of that project is to determine whether using virtual reality as an imagery device is more beneficial than using the imagination alone. In order to create the imagery, Becker and Pentland have developed a virtual environment of a bloodstream.

Reference-contexts: While the use of imagery has been shown to directly correlate with healing, the "relaxation response" associated with relaxation methods has been shown to boost the immune system's activity in general <ref> [8] </ref>. Stress seemingly shuts down the immune system, perhaps to prepare for a "fight or flight" response to a perceived threat; relaxation allows the immune system to flourish. For this reason, relaxation methods are commonly taught to cancer patients. <p> But here, within three to five minutes, the sheets started to steam and within forty-five minutes were completely dry," says Dr. Benson <ref> [8] </ref>. Benson termed this physiological response to this meditative state the Relaxation Response. Essentially, when a person perceives stress, the brain enters into a "flight or fight" response and releases hormones into the bloodstream to prepare the body.

Reference-contexts: The imagery and meditations used by the monks are similar to the hypnotic inductions used to treat warts. Both typically involve a relaxation phase and a guided imagery. As early as 1927, the first scientific studies on this issue were carried out by Block <ref> [9] </ref>. He used suggestion without hypnosis in his work, blindfolding his patients and painting their warts with an inert dye. More than half his patients lost their warts within three months (untreated, warts resolve spontaneously in 2.28 years on average [37]).

Reference-contexts: The use of the Viterbi algorithm to achieve recognition in the T'ai Chi Teacher uses a similar dynamic programming technique. Finally, the gesture recognition system of the Sensei system was derived directly from work done by Campbell, Becker, Azarbayejani, Bobick and Pentland <ref> [11] </ref>. In this work, we test a set of seven different feature vectors, all of were which were functions of coordinates of the hands and the head of a user, as input to an HMM system. <p> For the T'ai Chi Teacher, we felt that the use of functions based on the 3-D coordinates of the hands and head would be more appropriate. First of all, in previous work, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of several different such functions, using T'ai Chi gestures <ref> [11] </ref>. Perhaps more importantly, to build a platform for a more general teaching tool, one which is capable of distinguishing between gestures from an arbitrarily complex vocabulary, it is reasonable to assume that 3-D data might be necessary. <p> In the case of the T'ai Chi Teacher, we can assume that the user is facing the view screen, so rotation invariance is not a goal. For a more complete discussion of the issues surrounding feature vector selection, see <ref> [11] </ref>. 3.3.2 Choosing a Topology for the T'ai Chi Teacher The motion of T'ai Chi gestures proceeds in a time-ordered manner. That is, gestures proceed from a beginning to an end. <p> in the gesture, all that is required is to pick the minimum and maximum probability along the sequence. 33 Chapter 5 Experiments 5.1 Gesture Recognition Experiment Our previous work demonstrated that velocity features of 3-D tracking data of the hands can be used to achieve a highly accurate recognition rate <ref> [11] </ref>. In that system, 18 examples of 18 different T'ai Chi gestures were used as training, and testing was performed on 6 examples of each of the 18 gestures. No portion of the testing data was used during training. <p> The Viterbi algorithm returns the moments in the gesture where the model for the given gesture had the highest and lowest probability of producing the given observation sequence. How 1 Why only five T'ai Chi gestures? In our previous work <ref> [11] </ref>, we developed models for eighteen different gestures. However, because of the different preprocessing involved in this real-time implementation, we could not simply use the same models without completely retraining. <p> Currently, it is only capable of recognizing five different gestures. One simple extension of this work would be to increase the number of gestures in the system's vocabulary. The success of our previous T'ai Chi recognition system <ref> [11] </ref> suggests this goal is easily 42 attainable. In addition, using the STIVE tracking system does not allow the system to dis-tinguish between fine differences in hand positions and orientations which are an important part of T'ai Chi movements.

Reference-contexts: Instead, their work is a view-based approach in which matched filters are acquired for examples of different gestures and where a new filter is learned whenever an example is displayed for which no previous filter is well suited <ref> [13] </ref>. The relationship to the T'ai Chi Teacher is in their use of dynamic time warping to assist in recognition. The use of the Viterbi algorithm to achieve recognition in the T'ai Chi Teacher uses a similar dynamic programming technique.

Reference-contexts: In addition, their ability to automate segmentation and classification makes them well suited for gesture recognition. Early work with HMM's in vision was done by He and Kundu <ref> [16] </ref>, who used them to classify planar shapes. Their work derives more closely from work in the handwriting recognition community. Yamato, et. al., used HMM's to recognize three different subjects performing six different tennis swings. As input features to the HMM's, they used a 25 fi 25 quantized, subsampled image.

Reference-contexts: For example, numerous studies have shown that from imagery springs forth directly measurable effects such as the cure of warts or the reduction of scarring from burns <ref> [17, 37] </ref>. Furthermore, several studies have shown the efficacy of programs involving imagery and relaxation in increasing the expected lifespans of cancer patients [24, 34].

Reference-contexts: An expert, on the other hand, would probably best benefit from a highly critical feedback, one that identifies fine-grained differences between the motion and the ideal gesture. Also, the growing bed of tools provided by the field of affective computing <ref> [23] </ref> could be utilized to tune the feedback provided by the teacher. For example, if a user starts to become frustrated with the system, the frequency of interruptions and feedback could be adjusted.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, several studies have shown the efficacy of programs involving imagery and relaxation in increasing the expected lifespans of cancer patients <ref> [24, 34] </ref>. While it is difficult to prove which particular aspects of such programs (imagery, relaxation, expectation, or group meetings) account for the changes in prognoses, it is reasonable to assume that imagery has some effect, given the types of studies described above. <p> Post-white has not only shown the positive effects of imagery on emotion, immune function, and cancer outcome, but has shown that it causes an increase in lymphokine activated killer cells <ref> [24] </ref>. While the community studying the effect of imagery and relaxation on cancer patients has demonstrated a correlation between the practice of such measures and outcome, the hypnosis community has continued to refine its work on the treatment of warts.

As an input feature vector, Schlenzig uses a rotation invariant, binarized frame around the hand, processed by a neural net. Their system is capable of distinguishing between "hello", "good-bye", and "rotate".

Reference-contexts: Carl Simonton, et. al., was the originator of the idea of using these techniques with cancer patients <ref> [30] </ref>. If imagery and relaxation had been effective in giving control over parts of the body previously considered outside conscious control, they might give the body a way to focus the attention of the immune system on the cancer. Several researchers have investigated whether Simonton's hypothesis is correct. <p> Several researchers have investigated whether Simonton's hypothesis is correct. Simon-ton reported a life span extension of over 60% for patients enrolled at his center during 16 its first four years <ref> [30] </ref>. Achterburg and Lawlis also studied a group of patients enrolled in the Simonton's program and found consistently better results for patients that practiced imagery daily [1]. Achterburg argues, in fact, that the imagery itself is the important therapeutic component in the healing program.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, several studies have shown the efficacy of programs involving imagery and relaxation in increasing the expected lifespans of cancer patients <ref> [24, 34] </ref>. While it is difficult to prove which particular aspects of such programs (imagery, relaxation, expectation, or group meetings) account for the changes in prognoses, it is reasonable to assume that imagery has some effect, given the types of studies described above. <p> Achterburg argues, in fact, that the imagery itself is the important therapeutic component in the healing program. In a broader study, Spiegel, et. al., demonstrated that psychosocial interventions (which included group therapy and self-hypnosis) almost doubled survival time in the experimental group compared to the control group <ref> [34] </ref>. Several other researchers have shown relaxation and imagery to be an effective means of reducing stress and anxiety in cancer patients, without studying the specific effect on long-term survival [28, 15, 14, 18, 10, 31, 6].

Reference-contexts: Their system is capable of distinguishing between "hello", "good-bye", and "rotate". The recognition system of Sensei: The T'ai Chi Teacher is most directly influenced by work done by Starner and Pentland <ref> [35] </ref>. Using hand velocities and orientations in two dimensions, Starner was able to build an HMM system capable of recognizing forty American Sign Language gestures in a real-time system. The features are computed using a system that tracks hands wearing colored gloves. <p> The work done by Starner in particular, in which significant recognition success was achieved with a vocabulary of forty American Sign Language gestures, suggests that this framework is appropriate for the recognition task of the Sensei system <ref> [35] </ref>. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, Hidden Markov Models have the attractive feature of placing the entire recognition task in a probabilistic framework. <p> &lt; i) use the former to enforce that the final sequence chosen is valid. 23 Stereo pair 3-D estimate are the video and tracking from the two cameras and the bottom image is the result of triangulating. nates of both hands, as well as a description of the hands' orientations <ref> [35] </ref>. For the T'ai Chi Teacher, we felt that the use of functions based on the 3-D coordinates of the hands and head would be more appropriate. First of all, in previous work, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of several different such functions, using T'ai Chi gestures [11].

Reference-contexts: While training the model, it is then possible to prune the topology by removing states and links which are seldom used. Stolcke and Omohundro have attempted to automate this process. See <ref> [36] </ref> for details. 3.2.2 Choosing the observation vectors Another question to be answered when developing an HMM system is the choice of what to use as the observation vector. Consider the traffic light system again. The observation is of the color lit by the traffic light.

Reference-contexts: For example, numerous studies have shown that from imagery springs forth directly measurable effects such as the cure of warts or the reduction of scarring from burns <ref> [17, 37] </ref>. Furthermore, several studies have shown the efficacy of programs involving imagery and relaxation in increasing the expected lifespans of cancer patients [24, 34]. <p> He used suggestion without hypnosis in his work, blindfolding his patients and painting their warts with an inert dye. More than half his patients lost their warts within three months (untreated, warts resolve spontaneously in 2.28 years on average <ref> [37] </ref>). Memmesheimer and Eisenlohr followed this study with a more controlled experiment showing a similar connection between the cure of warts and suggestion [22]. In the 1950's, another series of studies probed the issue of hypnotizability and warts [21, 12, 2, 3, 38].

In the 1950's, another series of studies probed the issue of hypnotizability and warts <ref> [21, 12, 2, 3, 38] </ref>. Though these studies focused on the relationship between hypnotizability and efficacy of hypnotherapy, the idea that warts were susceptible to hypnotic suggestion (which usually entails extensive use of imagery) was reinforced.

Reference-contexts: The features are computed using a system that tracks hands wearing colored gloves. The system is capable of recognizing gestures with an accuracy of 97%. Wilson and Bobick <ref> [39] </ref> develop a state-based method of learning visual behavior of gestures in an image sequence. Multiple representations are fed into an HMM and the input's overall membership in a given state is determined by which representation best describes the input.

Reference-contexts: Yamato, et. al., used HMM's to recognize three different subjects performing six different tennis swings. As input features to the HMM's, they used a 25 fi 25 quantized, subsampled image. With thirty instances for each stroke used to train the models, successful classification between them was achieved <ref> [40] </ref>. Schlenzig, et. al. [29], demonstrated the ability of HMM's to recognize continuous gestures from image sequences, rather than from still frames. As an input feature vector, Schlenzig uses a rotation invariant, binarized frame around the hand, processed by a neural net.

Reference-contexts: T'ai Chi is among the more popular forms of martial arts in China and the world. Though like all martial arts, this exercise includes movements for attack and defense, there are several forms of T'ai Chi which are slow and gentle, such as the Yang, Wu or Sun styles <ref> [41] </ref>. The gestures for Staying Alive were chosen from the Yang style, which is meant for relaxation 11 and wholeness, not for fighting. <p> Recognition is achieved in real-time with the use of the Viterbi algorithm. The five gestures used in the system can be seen in Figure 1-1. These five gestures were chosen because they are the first five gestures in the short, Yang T'ai Chi sequence <ref> [41] </ref>. The probabilistic framework of Hidden Markov Models generalizes well for computing the moment in the user's expression of a gesture that differs most from the ideal form. <p> Because we wanted Sensei to demonstrate the ability to recognize gestures in a natural sequence, the five gestures we chose are the first five gestures in the short, Yang sequence <ref> [41] </ref>.
