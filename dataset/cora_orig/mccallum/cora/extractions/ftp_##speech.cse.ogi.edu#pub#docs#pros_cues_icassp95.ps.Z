Abstract: In this study we examined prosodic characteristics of a word used in several distinct senses in a task-oriented corpus of spontaneous speech. We compared the pitch characteristics of the word right used in three different senses: as an acknowledgment, as a direction, and as an affirmative answer to a question. Significant differences in intonation for different classes of usage were found, although the differences are not reliable enough to allow systems to use prosody alone to distinguish between usages. These results suggest that pitch change as reported by a pitch tracker could serve as a confirming cue when analyzing ambiguous speech recognizer output, or could serve as input to a probabilistic parser to aid in disambiguating senses of homonyms.

INTRODUCTION To improve the robustness and performance of spoken language understanding systems, we would like our systems to incorporate computational models of a variety of conversational cues <ref> [1] </ref>. Before we can take full advantage of these new resources, we must first better understand how various spontaneous speech phenomena interrelate.

Reference-contexts: Often only one word usage is considered for each item in the vocabulary. As vocabularies for these systems expand and become more general, however, this technique will not be adequate. The natural language processing community has made great strides in word sense disambiguation. McRoy <ref> [2] </ref> discusses the many cues that have proved valuable in textual word sense discrimination: morphology, syntactic tag, domain context, collocation (common expression), semantic context, syntax, role, discourse focus.

Reference-contexts: Where possible, we would like to drawn on low-level cues that are simple and fast to process, so that slower and more complex analysis can be reserved for those inputs that require it. Phrasal tunes offer valuable cues to the speakers intentions.

In fact, 18 of the 39 acknowledgment/answer rights occurred as single-word turns. When right is used as a direction, it is usually the first word in a longer phrase and as such is more likely to exhibit a rising intonation.

Reference-contexts: Phrasal tunes offer valuable cues to the speakers intentions. Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg [3] proposed that tunes signal relationships between the propositional content and the mutual beliefs of the participants. More specifically, Nakajima and Allen <ref> [4] </ref> examined the relationship between fundamental frequency (F0) and discourse structure in spontaneous task-oriented dialogue and found that F0 values tend to signal topic shift and PROSODIC CUES TO WORD USAGE Karen Ward and David G.

Reference-contexts: Pitch accents mark salient material [3], which may be useful not only in interpreting the intention behind the utterance but also in locating critical content words for recognition purposes. Prosodic cues have been used successfully in disambiguating syntactic structure in professionally read speech ([5], <ref> [6] </ref>), but we still lack computational models for understanding prosodic cues in spontaneous speech. In this study we tested the feasibility of using prosodic cues to aid in semantic disambiguation.

Reference-contexts: The use of acknowledgments assure conversants that the dialogue is on track and as such are important for a spoken language understanding system to recognize and to respond to appropriately <ref> [7] </ref>. We addressed the question of whether there were consistent prosodic differences in the way the word right was pronounced in each usage. To eliminate co-articulation effects, we included only occurrences that were turn or phrase-initial.

Reference-contexts: This is an inexact measure of prosodic tune; it does not, for example, capture the variations described by Grigoriu et al <ref> [8] </ref>. However, our measure does capture a high-level notion of intonation as rising, falling, or level, and it is easy and fast to compute from data readily available in a typical spoken language understanding system. Pitch determination by a pitch tracker is often inexact.

Reference-contexts: Pitch cues could be used dynamically to guide an integrated system in which acoustic analysis is interleaved with a probabilistic language model, as described by Goddeau <ref> [9] </ref>. In future work we will continue exploring the interrelationships between various cues available to a spoken language understanding system. We plan to focus next on cues contributing to the recognition of acknowledgments or confirmations in spontaneous speech.
