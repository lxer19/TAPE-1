Abstract: We initiate a study of a natural problem in secure systems, namely storing classified files on-line. A system of classified files contains a set of files (or documents), a set of users, and an authorization structure which defines the subset of files each user is authorized to see. We want a user in the system to be able to see every file in her "authorized list" but not any other file. We present definitions of secure classified file systems and discuss various aspects of such systems, such as static versus dynamic models, resilience, the role of a central trusted entity, etc. We also present a highly space-efficient implementation for a secure system which is based on RSA. Similar results were published by Gerald C. Chick and Stafford E. Tavares, "Flexible access control with master keys". Advances in Cryptology: CRYPTO '89, LNCS, vol. 435, Springer-Verlag, 1990. Pages 316-322.

Reference-contexts: It is widely believed that such "secure hashing" guarantees indistinguishablity. Indeed, if we model H as a random oracle (See <ref> [BR93] </ref> for a complete discussion and many examples) then it is possible to prove that the resulting scheme is secure in the sense of indistinguishablity.

Reference-contexts: Other works include encryption of files and concentrate on facilitating access of users to their files. These works usually assumes that each user should only be able to read her own files (e.g., <ref> [Bl93] </ref>). We are not aware of any work which considered the problem of arbitrary authorization structures in a file system. Another related work was done by Fiat and Naor ([FN93]) in the context of encrypting broadcast of movies.

Reference-contexts: This key has to allow a determination of any set of users as elligble to seeing the next film. Although the problem statement and the various tradeoffs are quite similar to ours, there are some fundamental differences between these problems which make the solutions in <ref> [FN93] </ref> useless in our problem (and vise-versa). Moreover, in the setting of [FN93] each user must get O (n log 2 n) keys and with each encrypted file (movie) they had to keep additional O (n 2 log 3 n) keys in the public space 2 . <p> Although the problem statement and the various tradeoffs are quite similar to ours, there are some fundamental differences between these problems which make the solutions in <ref> [FN93] </ref> useless in our problem (and vise-versa).

In x4 we describe RSA-based implementations of secure classified file systems. 2 This assumes full resilience. It is hown in <ref> [FN93] </ref> how to save space when the required resilience is smaller. 2 2 Preliminaries Negligible functions: We say that a non-negative function f (n) is negligible if as n gets larger, f (n) goes to zero faster than any polynomial in 1=n.

Reference-contexts: In fact, what we need is a much stronger notion of security: We need to prevent the adversary from knowing anything about these keys. That is, we want the keys to be polynomially indistinguishable from random strings given the relevant inputs (See <ref> [GM82] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Last, our scheme is simple and so is the intuition as to why it is secure. So although the proof may be technically involved, the implementation of the system is easy. Related work Although there has been work on introducing security into file-systems (e.g. <ref> [Ir95] </ref>), this work is mostly concerned with access control and not with secrecy of files. Other works include encryption of files and concentrate on facilitating access of users to their files. These works usually assumes that each user should only be able to read her own files (e.g., [Bl93]).
