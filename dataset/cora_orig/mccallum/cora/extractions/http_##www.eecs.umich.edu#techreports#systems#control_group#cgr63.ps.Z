This is equivalent to rank K n+k @(y [0];...;y [n+k]) which is equivalent to (d). 2 Remark: A quite different approach to invertibility is taken in <ref> [9] </ref>; the results of the next section show that, in the case of polynomial systems, the two approaches coincide. 5. <p> Difference algebra and the transformal transcedence degree The purpose of this section is to prove that the rank fl defined in (2.10), when specialized to systems whose right-hand-side depends polynomially on x and u (more precisely, on their components), corresponds to the transformal transcendence degree so successfully used by Fliess <ref> [9] </ref>. <p> This system is clearly analytic, so the analysis of Section 2 applies. For the purpose of clarity in presenting the results, it will be assumed that (5.1) is submersive. An extension to rational systems could also be undertaken.

Reference-contexts: The same result is also useful for showing the invariance of fl under the action of invertible (static or dynamic) state variable feedback. 11 Following [13], which in turn was based upon <ref> [20] </ref>, consider the Jacobian matrices J k (x; u [0]; . . . ; u [k]) := @(u [0]; . . . ; u [k]) for 0 k n, and their associated ranks R k := rank K J k : (3:2) Note that the matrices J k can be evaluated <p> ; u [k]) for 0 k n, and their associated ranks R k := rank K J k : (3:2) Note that the matrices J k can be evaluated symbolically; their ranks can be evaluated numerically since the rank over K is the same as the generic rank considered in <ref> [20] </ref>. Applying arguments identical to those used in [4, Section 2.1] results in the following relation between the integers k and R k . Proposition 3.1: For each 0 k n, k = n + R k .

Reference-contexts: For submersive systems the two lists coincide, and one can speak simply of the structure at infinity; this is also the case for systems satisfying certain constant rank hypotheses in the neighborhood of an equilibrium point, as can be seen from the results of <ref> [15, 21] </ref> . 2.2 Convergence of the chain E ffi E n . The goal of this subsection is to justify terminating the chain (2.7) at n, the dimension of the state space of (2.1), whenever the system is submersive. <p> Its convergence in no more than n steps follows from Theorem 2.1. A similar connection with the interesting work of <ref> [21] </ref> on dynamic feedback solutions to the noninteracting control problem could be also pursued along the lines already clearly established in [4]. 4.
