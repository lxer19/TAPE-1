Abstract: One difficulty in designing parallel algorithms is the large number of different models and machines. Algorithms (programs) are redesigned for each new model (machine). We are developing a general parallel computer model that will allow algorithms to be designed once, and have them apply to many specific machines. We will show how our techniques can be applied to solving some irregular problems.
