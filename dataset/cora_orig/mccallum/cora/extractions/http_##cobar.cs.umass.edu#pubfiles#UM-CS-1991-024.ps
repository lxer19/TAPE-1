Abstract: We consider the problem of routing jobs to parallel queues with identical exponential servers and unequal finite buffer capacities. Service rates are state-dependent and non-decreasing with respect to queue lengths. We establish the extremal properties of the Shortest Non-Full Queue (SNQ) and the Longest Non-Full Queue (LNQ) policies, in systems with concave/convex service rates. Our analysis is based on the weak majorization of joint queue lengths which leads to stochastic orderings of critical performance indices. Moreover, we solve the buffer allocation problem, i.e. the problem of how to distribute a number of buffers among the queues. The two optimal allocation schemes are also `extreme', in the sense of capacity balancing. Some extensions are also discussed.

Reference-contexts: If the queue lengths are observed then the intuitive `Join the Shortest Queue' (SQ) policy has been shown to be optimal with respect to various performance measures, such as throughput and delay (see <ref> [1, 2, 7, 9, 10] </ref> and [8] pp. 260-264). Menich [5] established the optimality of the SQ policy in systems with state-dependent service rates, Poisson arrivals, and queues with infinite buffer capacity by means of the standard uniformization method. A similar approach was used by Johri [3].

A similar approach was used by Johri <ref> [3] </ref>. In this paper, we study systems with general interarrival time distributions, queues with finite capacities and exponentially distributed state-dependent service times. In particular, we assume that service rates are non-decreasing and either concave or convex with respect to queue lengths.

It follows from the first part of Theorem 3.A.8. in <ref> [4] </ref> that is weak Schur-convex iff is non-decreasing and Shur-convex (see [4] for the definitions and properties of Shur-convex and Shur-concave functions). <p> It follows from the first part of Theorem 3.A.8. in <ref> [4] </ref> that is weak Schur-convex iff is non-decreasing and Shur-convex (see [4] for the definitions and properties of Shur-convex and Shur-concave functions).

Reference-contexts: Moreover, in the case of the LNQ policy, we need to make use of the fact that all capacities should be equal in order to establish the policy's extremal properties. Some new arguments are introduced for this purpose. Note that Shanthikumar <ref> [6] </ref> has established the extremal properties -with respect to throughput- of balancing the workload at the nodes of quasi-reversible closed queueing networks with convex/concave state-dependent service rates, and has also proved the 2 optimality of balanced workload in open queueing networks of the Jackson type. 2 Modeling framework Our basic framework
