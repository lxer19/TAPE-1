Abstract: This paper describes dynamic based programmable interconnect. Single ended, differential, and charge recycling circuits were implemented and studied on representative FPGA models. We studied the area, power, performance, reliability, and architectural impacts of these designs and compared the results to a static full swing base case. Dynamic based approaches can yield a 2X improvement in speed and a 7X improvement in switching energy, but suffer from complexity and area penalties.

Reference-contexts: So each signal will go through an on NMOS pass transistor before reaching the receiver inverter (which is minimum sized). Charge Recycling Bus Architecture To alleviate the power problem in the long interconnects, we study a charge recycling bus (CRB) scheme <ref> [1] </ref> here and see how much power reduction we can achieve. We will only cover our implementation highlights here as the details of operation is rather involved. We suggest the interested readers to consult the original paper. A simple overview of the drivers is shown below.

Reference-contexts: This really depends on how much of a threshold imbalance in the paired transistors within the sense amplifier we can tolerate. <ref> [2] </ref> measured results show that it can be as high as 15mV. So, by varying the dc offset voltage source within the sense amplifier, we obtain simulation results as follows: The x-axis indicates the amount of time after the clock edge.
