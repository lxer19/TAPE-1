Title: Chinook: The World Man-Machine Checkers Champion  
Author: Jonathan Schaeffer, Robert Lake, Paul Lu and Martin Bryant 
Keyword: game-playing, alpha-beta, heuristic search, checkers.  
Abstract: In 1992, the seemingly unbeatable World Checker Champion, Dr. Marion Tinsley, defended his title against the computer program Chinook. After an intense, tightly-contested match, Tinsley fought back from behind to win the match by scoring four wins to Chinook's two, with 33 draws. This was the first time in history that a human World Champion defended his title against a computer. This article reports on the progress of the checkers (88 draughts) program Chinook since 1992. Two years of research and development on the program culminated in a rematch with Tinsley in August 1994. In that match, after six games (all draws), Tinsley resigned the match and the World Championship title to Chinook citing health concerns. Chinook has since defended its title in two subsequent matches. This is the first time in history that a computer has won a human World Championship.

Reference-contexts: The databases contained roughly 40 billion positions, compressed into two gigabytes of data. The entire database was available to the program during a game, and was compressed in such a way as to allow rapid decompression at runtime <ref> (Lake et al. 1994) </ref>. After the 1992 match, errors were discovered in some of the endgame databases. In - 5 - retrospect, Chinook was fortunate not to lose game one of the 1992 match, as that result hinged on the erroneous values.

Reference-contexts: Compared to the program that played in 1992, important advances have been made to the program in each of these areas. - 3 - 2.1. Search Chinook uses a parallel alpha-beta search algorithm with all the latest enhancements <ref> (Lu, 1993) </ref>. Chinook 1992 had an average minimum search depth of 19 ply excluding search extensions (one ply equals one move by one player). Chinook 1994 ran on a 16 processor Silicon Graphics Challenge computer (150 MHz processors) with one gigabyte of RAM.

Reference-contexts: Since Tinsley was the undisputed human champion and Chinook had properly earned the right to challenge, the new Man-Machine title was a convenient way of keeping the checker federations happy. In August 1992, Chinook and Tinsley finally did battle <ref> (Schaeffer et al. 1993a) </ref>. The match was held in London, England, and was sponsored by Silicon Graphics, Inc. After initially falling behind, Tinsley rebounded and emerged victorious, scoring four wins to Chinook's two with 33 draws.

Reference-contexts: Some studies in chess have indicated that there might be a linear relationship between search depth and performance (Thompson, 1982). Experiments in Chinook show that there comes a point where increased search depth provides diminishing returns <ref> (Schaeffer et al. 1993b) </ref>. The data suggests that Chinook has already reached the point where little is to be gained by deeper searching; improved performance must come through knowledge enhancements instead of machine speed. Extensive work was done on improving the quality of the search tree built by Chi-nook.

Reference-contexts: The improved hardware allowed the program to search a minimum of an additional two ply deeper. As has been seen with chess programs, deeper search in checkers translates into stronger play. Some studies in chess have indicated that there might be a linear relationship between search depth and performance <ref> (Thompson, 1982) </ref>. Experiments in Chinook show that there comes a point where increased search depth provides diminishing returns (Schaeffer et al. 1993b).

Reference-contexts: Both journalistic claims are false, but they served to create the impression that there was nothing of scientific interest left in the game (Samuel himself made no such claims). Consequently, most subsequent games-related research turned to chess. Other than a program from Duke University in the 1970's <ref> (Truscott 1979) </ref>, little attention was paid to achieving a World Championship caliber checkers program. The Chinook project started in 1989 as an attempt to better understand heuristic search by using an experimental domain that is simpler than chess.
