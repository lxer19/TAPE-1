Abstract: We present a method for computing dense visual correspondence based on general assumptions about scene geometry. Our algorithm does not rely on correlation, and uses a variable region of support. We assume that images consist of a number of connected sets of pixels with the same disparity, which we call disparity components. Using maximum likelihood arguments, at each pixel we compute a small set of plausible disparities. A pixel is assigned a disparity d based on connected components of pixels, where each pixel in a component considers d to be plausible. Our implementation chooses the largest plausible disparity component; however, global contextual constraints can also be applied. While the algorithm was originally designed for visual correspondence, it can also be used for other early vision problems such as image restoration. It runs in a few seconds on traditional benchmark images with standard parameter settings, and gives quite promising results.

Reference-contexts: Finally, for each pixel P we chose disparity d, gain g, and bias b corresponding to the largest connected component containing P . This is a simple way to deal with g and b parameters (see <ref> [1] </ref> for a different solution). For all real images shown here, we vary g from 0.9 to 1.1 in intervals of 0.1 and b from -14 to 14 in intervals of 1. To produce a feasible disparity map, we check the output for double assignments in the following way.

Reference-contexts: These methods tend to produce poor results near discontinuities. In the last decade, a number of methods have been developed that also handle discon-tinuities. Markov Random Fields <ref> [2] </ref>, for example, explicitly model discontinuities using methods from statistical physics. Our method is comparable to MRF's, in that we avoid crossing discontinuities. MRF's, however, require exponential running time, while our method is linear in the number of pixels and disparities.

Reference-contexts: Most methods for computing visual correspondence make assumptions about the underlying scene.

Reference-contexts: Our adaptive window scheme ensures that the entire image is treated as a single window. This effectively propagates information from the high-texture regions at the outskirts of the image into the low-texture regions in the middle of the image. Kanade and Okotumi's algorithm <ref> [5] </ref> may also succeed in this situation, as long as the textureless region is rectangular. 3.2 Results on Real Images The digital imagery shown below, including both the original images and the results from various algorithms, can be accessed from the web. <p> Several researchers have designed adaptive methods that iteratively compute disparity, attempting to avoid crossing discontinuities.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Many problems in early vision are ill-posed, i.e. cannot be uniquely solved without additional constraints. Scene geometry can provide constraints that make these problems well-posed <ref> [6] </ref>. In this paper we describe an approach to early vision which exploits scene geometry in a novel manner. We assume that images consist of a number of connected sets of pixels with the same disparity, which we call disparity components. <p> Most methods for computing visual correspondence make assumptions about the underlying scene. For example, one popular method for computing motion [3] assumes that the underlying motion varies smoothly (in fact, a large number of methods based on regularization make such an assumption <ref> [6] </ref>). These methods tend to produce poor results near discontinuities. In the last decade, a number of methods have been developed that also handle discon-tinuities.
