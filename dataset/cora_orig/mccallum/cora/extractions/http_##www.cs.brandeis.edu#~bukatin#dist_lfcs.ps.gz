Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to defining and computing distances between programs via continuous generalized distance functions : AfiA ! D, where A and D are directed complete partial orders with the induced Scott topology, A is a semantic domain, and D is a domain representing distances (usually, some version of interval numbers). A continuous distance function can define a T 0 topology on a nontrivial domain A only if the axiom 90 2 D:8x 2 A:(x; x) = 0 does not hold. Hence, the notion of relaxed metric is introduced for domains | the axiom (x; x) = 0 is eliminated, but the axiom (x; y) = (y; x) and a version of the triangle inequality tailored for the domain D remain.

Reference-contexts: Then for any K 0 K, the weight of set K 0 , W (K 0 ) = P k2K 0 w (k 0 ), is well defined and belongs to <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. We have several versions of function . For most purposes it is enough to consider u (x; y) = 1 W (K x " K y ) and l (x; y) = 0. <p> Therefore u (x; y) u (x; x) + w (k) and thus y 62 B x;* . ut 7 Computability and Continuity We do not have space for a proper discussion on effective structures on domains (see <ref> [1] </ref> for some of it). <p> The actual computation of (x; y) goes as follows. Start with <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and go along the recursive enumerations of K x , K y , I x , and I y . <p> Consider u (x; y) = 1W (K x "K y ) and d (x; y) = u (x; y)u (x; x) = W (K x nK y ). This is a quasi-metric in the style of [9, 4], and it yields a Scott topology <ref> [1] </ref>. However, as discussed in [1], typically K x n K y is not recursive. Moreover, one should not expect K x n K y or its complement to be recursively enumerable. <p> Consider u (x; y) = 1W (K x "K y ) and d (x; y) = u (x; y)u (x; x) = W (K x nK y ). This is a quasi-metric in the style of [9, 4], and it yields a Scott topology <ref> [1] </ref>. However, as discussed in [1], typically K x n K y is not recursive. Moreover, one should not expect K x n K y or its complement to be recursively enumerable. <p> Function u gives a better upper estimate of the "ideal" distance between interval numbers, than the partial metric p ([a; b]; [c; d]) = max (b; d) min (a; c) described in [7]. For example, u ([0; 2]; <ref> [1; 1] </ref>) = 1, which is what one expects | if we know that one of the numbers is somewhere between 0 and 2, and another number equals 1, then we know that the distance between them is no greater than 1. However, p ([0; 2]; [1; 1]) = p ([0; <p> example, u ([0; 2]; <ref> [1; 1] </ref>) = 1, which is what one expects | if we know that one of the numbers is somewhere between 0 and 2, and another number equals 1, then we know that the distance between them is no greater than 1. However, p ([0; 2]; [1; 1]) = p ([0; 2]; [0; 2]) = 2. Now we describe two situations when the axioms of partial metrics are jus-tified. Consider again function d (x; y) = u (x; y) u (x; x) from Sect. 7.

Reference-contexts: This kind of reasoning is not valid for l (x; z). In fact, there are reasonable situations, when l (x; z) 6= 0, but l (x; y) = l (y; z) = 0. E.g., consider Example 1 and take x = <ref> [2; 2] </ref>; y = [2; 3]; z = [3; 3]. Also only u plays a role in the subsequent definition of the relaxed metric topology, and the most important results remain true even if we take l (x; y) = 0. <p> This kind of reasoning is not valid for l (x; z).

Now we describe two situations when the axioms of partial metrics are jus-tified. Consider again function d (x; y) = u (x; y) u (x; x) from Sect. 7. <p> In such case we still expect a relaxed metric , but its upper part u does not have to satisfy the axioms of partial metrics. 8.2 Potential Relationship with Measure Theory Important applications of domains to measure theory have emerged recently <ref> [2] </ref>. The construction developed in this paper suggests that fruitful applications in the opposite direction are possible. For example, in order to compute upper bound u (x; y) we measure common information shared by x and y and subtract it from the universal distance 1.

Reference-contexts: Continuous lower estimates are useful during actual computations of distances (Sect. 7) and for defining and computing an induced metric structure on the space of total elements (Theorem 8). There is a comparison in [7] between partial metrics and alternative generalized distance structures such as quasi-metrics and weighted metrics <ref> [5] </ref>. We provide what we believe to be the strongest argument in favor of partial metrics so far | among all those alternatives only partial metrics can be thought of as Scott continuous, computable functions. 2 Relaxed Metrics Consider distance domains in greater detail.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper we presume that the methods of denotational semantics allow us to obtain adequate descriptions of program behavior (e.g., see <ref> [10] </ref>). The term domain in this paper denotes a directed complete partial order (dcpo) equipped with the Scott topology. The traditional paradigm of denotational semantics states that all data types should be represented by domains and all computable functions should be represented by Scott continuous functions between domains. <p> Consider the typical setting in denotational semantics | a syntactic domain of programs, P , a semantic domain of meanings, A, and a continuous semantic function, [[ ]] : P ! A. The syntactic domain P (called a syntactic lattice in <ref> [10] </ref>) represents a data type of program parse trees, but we say colloquially that programs belong to P . ? Partially supported by NSF Grant CCR-9216185 and Office of Naval Research Grant ONR N00014-93-1-1015. <p> This class | all continuous Scott domains with countable bases | is sufficiently big to solve interesting domain equations and to define denotational semantics of at least sequential deterministic programming languages <ref> [10] </ref>. We introduce the notion of relaxed metric (Sect. 2), which maintains the intuitively clear requirement to reject axiom (x; x) = 0, but does not impose the specific axioms of partial metrics. We believe that the applicability of these specific axioms is more limited (see Sect. 8.1). <p> We are able to introduce relaxed metrics on a class of domains sufficiently large for practical applications in the spirit of <ref> [10] </ref>. For example, consider X = [[while B do S]], and the sequence of programs, P 1 = loop; :::; P N = if B then S;P N1 else skip endif; :::. Define X N = [[P N ]].
