Title: A Scheme for Real-Time Channel Establishment in Wide-Area Networks  
Author: Domenico Ferrari, FELLOW, IEEE, and Dinesh C. Verma 
Abstract: Multimedia communication involving digital audio and/or digital video has rather strict delay requirements. A real-time channel is defined in this paper as a simplex connection between a source and a destination characterized by parameters representing the performance requirements of the client. A real-time service is capable of creating real-time channels on demand and guaranteeing their performance. These guarantees often take the form of lower bounds on the bandwidth allocated to a channel and upper bounds on the delays to be experienced by a packet on the channel. In this paper, we study the feasibility of providing real-time services on a packet-switched store-and-forward wide-area network with general topology. We describe a scheme for the establishment of channels with deterministic or statistical delay bounds, and present the results of the simulation experiments we ran to evaluate it. The results are encouraging: our approach satisfies the guarantees even in worst-case situations, uses the network's resources to a fair extent, and efficiently handles channels with a variety of offered load and burstiness characteristics. Also, the packet transmission overhead is quite low, and the channel establishment overhead is small enough to be acceptable in most practical cases.

Reference-contexts: Hybrid schemes are attractive since they use the more appropriate technique for each of the two basic types of traffic, but they require more complex switches and policies, and do not integrate as completely these basic types as the other two schemes <ref> [Chen88] </ref>. This paper describes a method for guaranteeing delays in a packet-switching wide-area network, and presents an evaluation of some of its most important characteristics. We believe that the method can be used in all connection-oriented packet-switching environments, including ATM-style fast packet switching.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that this assumption is not exactly satisfied by links governed by contention-based protocols (e.g., Ethernets, see [Kuro84]), but it is by other types of LANs, such as FDDI rings (see for example [Sevc87], <ref> [Dyke88] </ref>). In the type of network we have just described, packet delays are much harder to control, and resources much more difficult to reserve for real-time traffic, if each packet going from a given source to a given destination is in principle allowed to follow any route.

Reference-contexts: A very simple algorithm for distributed rate control is presented in detail in <ref> [Ferr89] </ref>. One important consequence of this scheme for the algorithms in Section 4 is that we can assume that each channel satisfies its x min and x ave constraints at every node it traverses. 3.3. <p> If the combination corresponding to all channels through the node being active saturates the node, we will have to consider for the delay bound test a combination in which some of the channels are not active. Details about how such a combination can be arrived at are given in <ref> [Ferr89] </ref>. For the combination we have selected, let us denote by T the largest of the service times of packets that may traverse the node but do not travel on channels in set U. <p> Theorem: Scheduler saturation is impossible if and only if d i ,n j =1 S A proof of this theorem can be found in the Appendix, where we briefly discuss also the cases in which inequalities (9) do not hold. <ref> [Ferr89] </ref> contains a few examples of delay bound computations. The delay bound test consists of verifying that inequality (10) is satisfied for all values of i (i.e., for all channels in U), after the channel to be created has been added to the K already established ones.

Reference-contexts: The available options for providing real-time services in a wide-area context are circuit switching, fast packet switching, and combinations of these two techniques. The former is not particularly convenient when the traffic includes (as we expect it will in most cases) a large data/text component <ref> [Harr80] </ref>. Fast packet switching (for example, ATM) is better suited to the type of traffic we are envisioning; however, to our knowledge and in its formulations to date, it does not guarantee the low delays it can provide.

Reference-contexts: Without it, we would not be able to offer hard real-time guarantees, i.e., to guarantee that no packet is delayed more than a given bound. It should be noted that this assumption is not exactly satisfied by links governed by contention-based protocols (e.g., Ethernets, see <ref> [Kuro84] </ref>), but it is by other types of LANs, such as FDDI rings (see for example [Sevc87], [Dyke88]).

Reference-contexts: Such guarantees will have to be provided not only by local-area networks, where solutions like the FDDI ring and its protocols are already being developed <ref> [Ross86] </ref>, but also by wide-area networks: the need for multimedia conferencing services is only one of the many examples that can be invoked to demonstrate the validity of this statement.

Reference-contexts: The scheme works only in conjunction with specific scheduling and flow control policies. These policies are briefly described in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively. 3.1. Scheduling Scheduling in the hosts and in the nodes will be deadline-based. More precisely, we adopt a modification of the EDD (Earliest Due Date) <ref> [LiuL73] </ref> policy in which, in the case of a conflict, priority is given to deterministic over statistical channels. All of the other tasks of a host or node, including sending, forwarding, and receiving datagrams, have a lower priority; local tasks are preemptable by real-time packets.

Reference-contexts: While p, the ratio between the average and peak throughput requirements of a channel, appears to be a simple measure of burstiness, q has similarities with the ``traffic density'' parameter found in, for example, <ref> [Ohni88] </ref>. Both p and q range between 0 and 1. A value of p close to unity indicates a smooth arrival pattern, while a value close to zero corresponds to burstier traffic. On the other hand, a higher value of q indicates more burstiness.

Reference-contexts: our scheme too conservative? For example, how close are our guaranteed bounds on delays to the actual delays? g What is the ``cost'' of a statistical channel as compared to that of a deterministic channel? We provide answers to these questions by means of a network simulator written in CSIM <ref> [Schw87] </ref>. We have simulated several different networks but will only present and discuss the results obtained for the 14-node network shown in Figure 1 (a) and for a simple network consisting of only two nodes. In Figure 1 (a), nodes 0-8 serve as sources and destinations for the real-time channels.
