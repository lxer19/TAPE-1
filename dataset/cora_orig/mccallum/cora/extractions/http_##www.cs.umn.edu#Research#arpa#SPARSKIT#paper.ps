Title: SPARSKIT: a basic tool kit for sparse matrix computations VERSION 2  
Author: Youcef Saad 
Date: June 6, 1994  
Abstract: This paper presents the main features of a tool package for manipulating and working with sparse matrices. One of the goals of the package is to provide basic tools to facilitate exchange of software and data between researchers in sparse matrix computations. Our starting point is the Harwell/Boeing collection of matrices for which we provide a number of tools. Among other things the package provides programs for converting data structures, printing simple statistics on a matrix, plotting a matrix profile, performing basic linear algebra operations with sparse matrices and so on. fl Work done partly at CSRD, university of Illinois and partly at RIACS (NASA Ames Research Center). Current address: Computer Science Dept., University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455. This work was supported in part by the NAS Systems Division, via Cooperative Agreement NCC 2-387 between NASA and the University Space Research Association (USRA) and in part by the Department of Energy under grant DE-FG02-85ER25001.

Reference-contexts: The advantage of this scheme for matrix multiplications has been illustrated in [9] and in <ref> [1] </ref> in the context of triangular system solutions. 2.1.11 The Symmetric and Unsymmetric Sparse Skyline format (SSS, USS) This is an extension of the CSR-type format described above. <p> GETL This subroutine extracts the lower triangular part of a matrix, including the main diagonal. The algorithm is in-place. GETU Extracts the upper triangular part of a matrix. Similar to GETL. SPARSKIT 14 LEVELS Computes the level scheduling data structure for lower triangular matrices, see <ref> [1] </ref>. AMASK Extracts C = A fi M , i.e., performs the mask operation. This routine computes a sparse matrix from an input matrix A by extracting only the elements in A, where the corresponding elements of M are nonzero.

Reference-contexts: A simple method used to store a Symmetric Skyline matrix is to place all the rows in order from 1 to N in a real array A and then keep an integer array which holds the pointers to the beginning of each row, see <ref> [2] </ref>. The column positions of the nonzero elements stored in A can easily be derived and are therefore not needed. However, there are several variations to this scheme that are commonly used is commercial software packages.

Reference-contexts: Many of the other existing schemes are specialized to some extent. The reader is referred to the book by Duff et al. <ref> [3] </ref> for more details. SPARSKIT 4 2.1 Storage Formats Currently, the conversion routines of SPARSKIT can handle thirteen different storage formats. These include some of the most commonly used schemes but they are by no means exhaustive. <p> The savings in memory and in the use of indirect addressing with this scheme over Compressed Sparse Row can be substantial for large values of NBLK. 2.1.7 The Symmetric Skyline format (SSK) A skyline matrix is often referred to as a variable band matrix or a profile matrix <ref> [3] </ref>. The main attraction of skyline matrices is that when pivoting is not necessary then the skyline structure of the matrix is preserved during Gaussian elimination. If the matrix is symmetric we only need to store its lower triangular part. This is a collection of rows whose length varies.

Reference-contexts: A useful collection of sparse matrices known as the Harwell/Boeing collection, which is publically available <ref> [4] </ref>, has been widely used in recent years for testing and comparison purposes. Because of the importance of this collection many of the tools in SPARSKIT can be considered as companion tools to it. <p> PRTUNF Writes matrices (in CSR format) in unformatted files. READUNF Reads unformatted file containing matrices in CSR format. The routines readmt and prtmt allow to read and create files containing matrices stored in the H/B format. For details concerning this format the reader is referred to <ref> [4] </ref> or the summary given in the documentation of the subroutine READMT. While the purpose of readmt is clear, it is not obvious that one single subroutine can write a matrix in H/B format and still satisfy the needs of all users.

Reference-contexts: This structure has probably been the first one to be exploited for the purpose of improving SPARSKIT 7 performance of matrix by vector products on supercomputers, see references in <ref> [9] </ref>. To store these matrices we may store the diagonals in a rectangular array DIAG (1 : N; 1 : N DIAG) where NDIAG is the number of diagonals. We also need to know the offsets of each of the diagonals with respect to the main diagonal. <p> As a convention IST ART (i) = 0, means that the i-th row is empty. 2.1.10 The Jagged Diagonal format (JAD) This storage mode is very useful for the efficient implementation of iterative methods on parallel and vector processors <ref> [9] </ref>. Starting from the CSR format, the idea is to first reorder the rows of the matrix decreasingly according to their number of nonzeros entries. Then, a new data structure is built by constructing what we call "jagged diagonals" (j-diagonals). <p> The advantage of this scheme for matrix multiplications has been illustrated in <ref> [9] </ref> and in [1] in the context of triangular system solutions. 2.1.11 The Symmetric and Unsymmetric Sparse Skyline format (SSS, USS) This is an extension of the CSR-type format described above. <p> One argument in this favor is that vector machines usually give a better performance for such operations as matrix vector by multiplications for matrices stored in CSC format. In fact for parallel machines which have a low overhead in loop synchronization (e.g., the Alliants), the situation is reversed, see <ref> [9] </ref> for details. For almost any argument in favor of one scheme there seems to be an argument in favor of the other. Fortunately, the difference provided in functionality is rather minor.
