Title: Toward Simplifying and Accurately Formulating Fragment Assembly  
Author: Eugene W. Myers 
Keyword: shotgun DNA sequencing, fragment assembly, sequence reconstruction.  
Abstract: The fragment assembly problem is that of reconstructing a DNA sequence from a collection of randomly sampled fragments. Traditionally the objective of this problem has been to produce the shortest string that contains all the fragments as substrings, but in the case of repetitive target sequences this objective produces answers that are overcompressed. In this paper, the problem is reformulated as one of finding a maximum-likelihood reconstruction with respect to the 2-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, and it is argued that this is a better formulation of the problem. Next the fragment assembly problem is recast in graph-theoretic terms as one of finding a non-cyclic subgraph with certain properties and the objectives of being shortest or maximally-likely are also recast in this framework. Finally, a series of graph reduction transformations are given that dramatically reduce the size of the graph to be explored in practical instances of the problem. This reduction is very important as the underlying problems are NP-hard. In practice, the transformed problems are so small that simple branch-and-bound algorithms successfully solve them, thus permitting auxiliary experimental information to be taken into account in the form of overlap, orientation, and distance constraints.

The problem of repeats has only become acute in recent years because researchers are beginning to sequence higher organisms that have a greater tendency towards such sequence, and because with increasing target length, there is greater chance of a large scale repeat being within the target.

Reference-contexts: While it is certainly true that knowing an SCS implies the original target DNA duplex is known in the sense of learning theory [Li-90], the plain fact is that in practice SCS-based algorithms do not correctly handle repetitive sequence (e.g. <ref> [Kec-91] </ref>).
