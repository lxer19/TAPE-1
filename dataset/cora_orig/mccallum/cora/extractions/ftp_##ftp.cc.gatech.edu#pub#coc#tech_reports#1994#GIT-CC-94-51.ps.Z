Abstract: Video traffic multiplexers in high speed ATM networks are prone to fairness problems with respect to the per-connection cell loss ratio experienced by multiplexed video sources. The problem is a result of the random, but fixed over time, relation of the frame transmission epochs that feed a multiplexer. This paper presents a solution to this fairness problem which is based on the enforcement of controlled per-connection delays. The amount of delay imposed on each source is calculated by an optimization process at connection admission and termination instants. Two different optimization objectives, one minimax and one minisum, are considered. Their performance and their relation to buffer space constraints is examined. The loss and delay performance of the scheme is also evaluated through simulations. In particular, very low per-connection delay variance is observed, indicating reduced jitter. Finally, two implementation alternatives of the scheme on an ATM network are presented: (a) as a protocol between multiplexer and sources and (b) as a non-work conserving service discipline for multiplexers. The engineering aspects and, in particular, the buffer demands of the two alternative implementations are discussed in detail.

Reference-contexts: Finally, note that the assumption that the transmission epochs are aligned according to the best alignment has been used in the past, e.g., in the case of a multiplexer delay study under different bandwidth sharing schemes in <ref> [1] </ref>. That is, there seems to be an agreement on the importance of the ideal alignment.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the best alignment achieves cell loss fairness, as we will see in section 3. Our objective is to force the random transmission epochs of the sources to be aligned exactly as in the best alignment. In <ref> [2] </ref>, a similar observation was made and it was hinted that additional circuitry is needed to enforce the alignment. However, no details as to how to achieve the alignment, even in circuitry, were given.

We will assume that the solution of the MS formulation is provided by the ASSIGNMENT MS function and the solution for the MM formulation by the ASSIGNMENT MM function.

Reference-contexts: This problem generates concerns regarding the quality of service (QoS) of separate channels utilizing the same network. That is, certain channels may consistently receive better performance than others, potentially contrary to contractual agreement. A first solution to the cell loss fairness problem is proposed in <ref> [5] </ref> and it is based on a modification of the multiplexer's FCFS scheduling discipline. Each connection is associated with a counter indicating how many cells of this connection have been dropped so far. <p> This modification ameliorates the fairness problem but it does not solve it. For example, even when the modified scheduling discipline is applied, there exist connections that receive an order of magnitude more losses than others (in Table I of <ref> [5] </ref>). The intuitive explanation is that there exist instances when the connection with the lowest counter value has no cells queued. Hence, even though its counter is low, we can not victimize this connection. <p> Notably, the nature of the first application is real-time and delays are more crucial than in the second application.

Our example consists of 16 sources feeding a multiplexer. Each source sends its traffic, without smoothing, over a 8.5 Mbps link at a frame rate of 25 frames per second. <p> We do not make any particular assumption about the length of the links from the sources to the multiplexer, which can be potentially long without harming our equalization scheme. The traffic of each source is generated by a Gamma distribution with the same parameters as in <ref> [5] </ref>. The only difference with respect to the Gamma-based traffic model in [5] is that we consider a cells 53 octets instead of 64 octets. <p> The traffic of each source is generated by a Gamma distribution with the same parameters as in <ref> [5] </ref>.

Bursts of more than 801 cells per frame are truncated to satisfy the assumption that the per-frame burst of cells can be transmitted in a single frame period at maximum input link rate.

In addition, the best of the three alternatives presented in [8] needs extensive information about the source traffic (stationary distribution of each source's traffic intensity throughout the frame period). We take a different approach by controlling the transmission epochs even after admission with the intention to always equi-distribute losses among admitted connections.
