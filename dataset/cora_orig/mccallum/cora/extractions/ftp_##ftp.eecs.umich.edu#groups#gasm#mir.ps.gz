Title: Evolving algebras and labelled deductive systems for the semantic network based reasoning (extended abstract)  
Author: Alexei P. Lisitsa and Gennady S. Osipov 
Abstract: In the present paper we deal with two approaches suitable to formal treatment of semantical network based reasoning, that are Evolving Algebras (EA) and Labelled Deductive Systems (LDS). The evolving algebras methodology give a tools for precise operational description of the any computational process at the desired level of abstraction, while labelled deduction systems allows to treat various logical based approaches in the unified way. We give the formalizations the semantical networks based reasoning in the both formalisms and discuss their relationships.

Extending this view, we may hope that EAs, due their universality, may give a semantic for all labelled deductive systems.

Reference-contexts: The aim of this section is to show potential applicability of the Evolving Algebras (EA) formalism for this purpose 4 . Evolving Algebras approach for describing the computations was proposed by Yu. Gurevich in <ref> [5] </ref>. It can be considered from the one hand as the theoretical model of computation, generalizing Turing and Kolmogorov-Uspensky machines, and from another hand as the convenient practical tool for specification and verification of computational systems.
