Abstract: of order 9 Stephan Brandt Fachbereich Mathematik & Informatik, WE 2 Freie Universitat Berlin Arnimallee 3 14195 Berlin, Germany Submitted: September 4, 1997; Accepted: January 3, 1998 Abstract We determine the Ramsey numbers r(K 3 ; G) for all 261080 connected graphs of order 9 and further Ramsey numbers of this type for some graphs of order up to 12. Almost all of them were determined by computer programs which are based on a program for generating maximal triangle-free graphs.

Reference-contexts: Because of the large number of small Ramsey numbers computed here, trends for the asymptotic growth of Ramsey numbers can be detected empirically. Some of them are opposed to the previously expected behaviour. Motivated by our data, in <ref> [1] </ref> the first author succeeded in disproving several goodness conjectures for more general classes of Ramsey numbers by purely theoretical (probabilistic) means. <p> The general belief|expressed in a number of conjectures|was that the growth of f (K 3 ; n) is superlinear in n. Motivated by the present results, Brandt <ref> [1] </ref> proved that for every constant c, almost all (with probability tending to 1) regular graphs H of sufficiently large degree d have Ramsey number r (G; H) &gt; cjHj for every non-bipartite graph G.

Reference-contexts: ; K 9 K 3 ) = 28. 2 The algorithm The central tool for the computation of the remaining 261071 Ramsey numbers r (K 3 ; H) for connected graphs H of order 9 and the further Ramsey numbers which we computed, is the computer program mtf described in <ref> [2] </ref>. This program is designed the electronic journal of combinatorics 5 (1998), #R7 4 to generate all non-isomorphic maximal triangle-free graphs, but it is prepared to include certain restrictions into the generation process. One of these restrictions is to generate only Ramsey graphs for (K 3 ; H). <p> Note that a maximal triangle-free supergraph of a Ramsey graph for (K 3 ; H) of the same order is a Ramsey graph for (K 3 ; H) as well. More details can be found in [3] and <ref> [2] </ref>. The amount of time needed to compute a single Ramsey number r (K 3 ; H) turns out to depend mainly on the magnitude of r (K 3 ; H).

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, his results are unreliable since some of the numbers turned out to be incorrect. The correct numbers for all connected graphs of order 7 and 8 were computed by Brinkmann <ref> [3] </ref>, also using a computer. Independently, Schelten and Schiermeyer computed the Ramsey numbers for graphs of order 7 by hand [15,16]. We will give the Ramsey numbers for all connected graphs of order 9. The Ramsey numbers up to r = 27 are determined by computer programs. <p> Note that a maximal triangle-free supergraph of a Ramsey graph for (K 3 ; H) of the same order is a Ramsey graph for (K 3 ; H) as well. More details can be found in <ref> [3] </ref> and [2]. The amount of time needed to compute a single Ramsey number r (K 3 ; H) turns out to depend mainly on the magnitude of r (K 3 ; H). <p> Furthermore a lot of useless work is done if the subgraph chains are traversed in a direction where no information is gained. So for larger lists we optimized the methods already used in <ref> [3] </ref>, developing a strategy which has the following property: to generate the Ramsey numbers for all connected graphs of order n with Ramsey number at most r 0 , only the Ramsey numbers of the maximal elements of the subgraph lattice with Ramsey number r r 0 are actually computed and <p> To compute r (K 3 ; H) for the graphs of order 9 and 10, we used the method described above, some preliminary methods on the way from those described in <ref> [3] </ref>, and some runs testing small groups.

Reference-contexts: A second problem which we investigated is the concept of goodness introduced by Burr in <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In the case G = K p the most sparse connected graphs, namely trees, are known to be K p -good [7]. In <ref> [5] </ref> the question was raised for the functions f (K p ; n) and g (K p ; n), where f (K p ; n) is the largest integer such that every connected graph of order n with at most f (K p ; n) edges is K p -good and <p> Since trees attain the indicated bound, f (K p ; n) and g (K p ; n) are well defined. Not much is known about g (K p ; n). Burr et.al. <ref> [5] </ref> proved that (n p=(p1) ) g (K p ; n) O (n (p+2)=p (log n) (p 2 p) ) and improved the lower bound by a factor of p log n for p = 3. <p> The situation is different for f (K p ; n). For p 4 it was shown by Burr et.al. <ref> [5] </ref>, that f (K p ; n) = n + o (n), while for p = 3 they proved that f (K 3 ; n) &gt; 17n=15 for n 4.

Reference-contexts: This implies that f (K 3 ; n) is linear in n, and in fact it can be shown that f (K 3 ; n) &lt; 12n for large n. This complements a result of Burr et. al. <ref> [6] </ref>, saying that for every bipartite graph G and constant , every graph H of sufficiently large order n with bounded maximum degree (H) is G-good, i.e. r (G; H) = n 1 + s (G).

Reference-contexts: Here we will deal with Ramsey numbers r (K 3 ; H) for connected graphs H of small order. A few years ago, these numbers were completely determined only for graphs H up to order 6, the last (and major) step being done by Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp <ref> [8] </ref>. Only recently, the numbers for all connected graphs of order 7 were computed by Jin Xia [10] in his thesis by using a computer. Unfortunately, his results are unreliable since some of the numbers turned out to be incorrect.

Reference-contexts: Based on the graphs giving the lower bound for p = 3, a possible structure for the graphs determining g (K 3 ; n) was proposed by Faudree, Rousseau and Schelp <ref> [9, Question 2.32] </ref>. This structure consists of the disjoint union of complete graphs and an additional vertex joined to all other vertices.

Reference-contexts: Hence K n K 1;s is contained in the subgraph of F induced by S [ fwg. 2 Recently, Kim proved that r (K 3 ; K n ) = fi (n 2 = log n) <ref> [11] </ref>, so Theorem 1 yields r (K 3 ; K n K 1;s ) = r (K 3 ; K n1 ) if s = (log n). In the case that we are mainly interested in (n = 9), Theorem 1 gives equality for s 2.

Reference-contexts: Some tests starting runs on smaller size graphs before the larger size computations were completed lead to an enormous amount of computational overlap, so we did not follow this strategy any further. The graphs of order n to be tested were generated by the program makeg <ref> [12] </ref>. In our computations the average time needed to compute a MAXGRAPH is significantly longer than the average time needed to compute a RAMSEYGRAPH, while the time needed to test a graph against all existing MIN-, MAX-, and RAMSEY-GRAPHs is negligible.

Reference-contexts: Graphs with the same number of edges can be tested in parallel. We ran this program on a large cluster of workstations in Berlin and Bielefeld using the program autoson <ref> [13] </ref> to distribute the jobs. Only some small amount of communication between the processes was necessary in order to distribute new RAMSEYGRAPHs and MAXGRAPHs. This was done by using a common file system.

Reference-contexts: The computation of the Ramsey numbers for all graphs of order 10 seems currently out of reach, since the upper and lower bounds for the Ramsey numbers r (K 3 ; K 10 ) and r (K 3 ; K 10 e), respectively, both differ by 3 (see <ref> [14] </ref>). A second problem which we investigated is the concept of goodness introduced by Burr in [4]. <p> The only exceptions are the cases r (K 3 ; K 9 ) = 36 and r (K 3 ; K 9 e) = 31 (which are well-known seethe regularly updated dynamic survey of Radziszowski <ref> [14] </ref>), r (K 3 ; K 9 K 1;s ) = 28 for 2 s 7 and r (K 3 ; K 9 K 3 ) = 28 which are determined with the help of standard theoretical Ramsey arguments.
