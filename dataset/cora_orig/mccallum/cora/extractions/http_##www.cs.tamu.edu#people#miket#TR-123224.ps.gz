Reference-contexts: Moreover, the queuing analysis considers possible detouring of vehicles on a ramp queue. Messer and Chang used the Origin-Destination matrix to estimate the corresponding coefficients. We can define the Origin-Destination matrix using the geometric structure of freeway and historical information on the drivers' routes <ref> [1, 18, 32] </ref>. Simulations on real traffic data show that Messer and Chang's algorithm has a better performance than other similar optimization algorithms [17]. By using their approach, we can optimize ramp metering rates under some conditions; the implementation is comparatively simple. <p> We compare the acurracy of our adaptive method for O-D probability calculation with that of proportional distribution method under a simulated freeway environment. In our simulation, vehicle arrivals at each entrance ramp follow a Poisson distribution whose the average arrival rate is based on field survey data <ref> [1] </ref> for 3 hours of morning peak traffic. In Table 1 we show inter-arrival rates of entrance ramps where these rates can increase or decrease randomly with time. The speed of a vehicle follows the normal distribution.

Reference-contexts: According to the hill-climbing method, the adjustment to r i is given as: r i = "[ @G i @r i @U i @R i + j=1 j6=i @R j @r i where " is the adjustment parameter which we can pre-decide from sample data <ref> [2, 24] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In pretimed schemes, the time of day, weather condition, and historical traffic data determine the ramp metering rates [9]. The main disadvantage of pretimed systems is that they cannot adapt to the actual freeway traffic situation. To cope with this problem, traffic-responsive systems have been developed <ref> [3] </ref>. In the traffic-responsive approach, we utilize detectors and computers to determine mainline flow and ramp demand in the immediate vicinity of the ramp and to set an appropriate metering rate. There are two basic types of traffic-responsive ramp metering schemes: flow-based and gap-based. <p> The detectors and ramp meters of a ramp metering system can be isolated or coordinated. In an isolated system, ramp meters make decisions based only on the local traffic data <ref> [3, 16, 25] </ref>. In a system-wide control approach, ramp meters coordinate with each other to make system-wide control decisions [10, 17]. In this report we develop an Advanced Real-time Ramp Metering System (ARMS) freeway systems. <p> Therefore, some probability-based algorithms have been developed to deal with the nondeterministic correlation between system parameters. A typical example reflecting this approach is the fuzzy-set based control scheme proposed by Chen and May <ref> [3] </ref> for entrance ramp control at the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Their main observation about conventional schemes is that traffic conditions are usually defined in a crisp (deterministic) manner. For example, we often define congestion as the occupancy being greater than a fixed threshold. <p> entrance ramps, we assign a weighted factor to each section, such that, the rate reduction in the nearest ramp is maximum. 58 4.3 CONGESTION RESOLUTION 4.3.1 Background In order to define the traffic condition as congested or non-congested, most of the existing algorithms employ occupancy as the prime control variable <ref> [3, 13] </ref>. If the current measurement of occupancy does not satisfy the pre-defined set of non-congested traffic conditions, then we say that congestion occurs [22, 23]. <p> Not many publications consider entrance ramp control for congestion dissipation. Moreover, most existing solutions do not consider balancing of congestion dissipation time and surface street service. In Chen and May's study <ref> [3] </ref>, an operator takes over the control of traffic manually with the objectives: 1) to maximize overall throughput, 2) to maintain safe conditions in the congested area, and 3) to minimize adverse impact on local streets. <p> Hence, when the traffic exhibits a transient condition, such as a transition from a non-congested state to a congested state or vice-versa, this scheme may become ineffective. Besides all the problems discussed above, the notion of control area is not well-defined in the literature. Chen and May <ref> [3] </ref>, for example, presented a scheme in which they employ a fuzzy definition of control area. They do not control congestion occurring outside the boundary of control area until the impact of the congestion propagates to the control area.

Reference-contexts: If the current measurement of occupancy does not satisfy the pre-defined set of non-congested traffic conditions, then we say that congestion occurs [22, 23]. Cook and Cleveland <ref> [4] </ref> carried out an analysis of thirteen control variables for congestion detection, and they found that the most effective ways to detect congestion are either volume, occupancy, or station discontinuity of kinetic energies in neighboring stations.

Reference-contexts: Gartner and Reiss proposed a scheme [7] in which they calculate metering rates based on the predicted demands at the entrance ramps and the downstream capacities. In the gap-acceptance approach <ref> [5, 14, 8] </ref>, the entrance ramp allows vehicles to enter the freeway when its detectors find gaps in the mainline traffic stream. The major disadvantage of this approach is that they control entrance ramps independently ignoring interdependencies with other ramps and, thus, may not be effective in dissipating congestion.

Reference-contexts: Algorithms based on traffic-flow theories determine ramp metering rates based on the current flow rate and occupancy values. The gap-based approach attempts to maximize the volume entering the freeway by looking for "gaps" in the main traffic stream. Upstream detectors provide gap information <ref> [8] </ref>. Predictive schemes have been developed to predict traffic conditions in the near future and prevent conditions such as flow breakdowns. The detectors and ramp meters of a ramp metering system can be isolated or coordinated. <p> Currently, a central computer controls several ramps, as in the Gulf Freeway Ramp Control System in Texas <ref> [8, 25] </ref>. This system integrated surveillance and control system functions in the same system. Traffic-responsive ramp metering controllers have been installed on eight entrance ramps and control decisions are made by a central computer based on demand-capacity and gap-acceptance control strategies. <p> Gartner and Reiss proposed a scheme [7] in which they calculate metering rates based on the predicted demands at the entrance ramps and the downstream capacities.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION We can broadly divide the ramp metering techniques into three categories: pretimed, traffic-responsive, and predictive. In pretimed schemes, the time of day, weather condition, and historical traffic data determine the ramp metering rates <ref> [9] </ref>. The main disadvantage of pretimed systems is that they cannot adapt to the actual freeway traffic situation. To cope with this problem, traffic-responsive systems have been developed [3]. <p> Figure 2 illustrates our freeway model in which each entrance ramp has a ramp metering controller and neighboring controllers connect to each other through a communication network. We denote pair-wise inductive loop detectors located in three locations of a section as upstream, midstream, and downstream detectors <ref> [9] </ref>. The three locations connect to their local ramp metering controller to provide traffic information such as traffic flow and occupancy.

By using real-time traffic data, we can derive the utility gain by adjustments of ramp metering rates, from the throughput-gain functions and the congestion-risk functions. We adjust the ramp metering rate setting step-by-step in each control interval T .

Reference-contexts: When a flow breakdown occurs, congestion may propagate in the form of a shock-wave towards downstream, upstream, or both directions, depending on the traffic conditions <ref> [15] </ref>. In order to resolve congestion, we need to consider the traffic conditions both on freeway and surface streets.

In this section, we classify the current ramp metering schemes and briefly discuss merits and demerits of those approaches. 2.1 SYSTEM-WIDE PRETIMED APPROACH Messer and Chang <ref> [17] </ref> studied a system-wide ramp metering control strategy based on static optimization methods. They used a linear programming model, which was proposed initially by Wattleworth [30], as the basic technique to search for optimal ramp metering rates. <p> We can define the Origin-Destination matrix using the geometric structure of freeway and historical information on the drivers' routes [1, 18, 32]. Simulations on real traffic data show that Messer and Chang's algorithm has a better performance than other similar optimization algorithms <ref> [17] </ref>. By using their approach, we can optimize ramp metering rates under some conditions; the implementation is comparatively simple.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the queuing analysis considers possible detouring of vehicles on a ramp queue. Messer and Chang used the Origin-Destination matrix to estimate the corresponding coefficients. We can define the Origin-Destination matrix using the geometric structure of freeway and historical information on the drivers' routes <ref> [1, 18, 32] </ref>. Simulations on real traffic data show that Messer and Chang's algorithm has a better performance than other similar optimization algorithms [17]. By using their approach, we can optimize ramp metering rates under some conditions; the implementation is comparatively simple. <p> Here we briefly review some existing techniques to estimate the O-D trip tables <ref> [18, 32] </ref> and then present our method. Let O i denote the total number of trips entering the entrance ramp of S i , and D j denote the total number of trips departing the exit ramp of S j within a time period. <p> The proportional distribution model, considers neither distance nor travel time. In fact, it has been observed that vehicles with a very short or very long travel distance have a very small probability to exit the freeway, no matter how large the entrance flow is. To remedy this deficiency, Nihan <ref> [18] </ref> proposed the Gamma distribution to model the travel distances of freeway motorists. Geometric characteristics such as shopping malls or sports stadiums may affect the accuracy of this method.

Reference-contexts: As pointed out by Nihan and Berg <ref> [19] </ref>, most responsive ramp metering systems determine ramp metering rates based on one-minute old historical data; that is, existing ramp-metering systems react to past traffic conditions and, thus, cannot effectively prevent flow-breakdowns. The Seattle control system is developed to overcome this problem [19]. <p> As pointed out by Nihan and Berg <ref> [19] </ref>, most responsive ramp metering systems determine ramp metering rates based on one-minute old historical data; that is, existing ramp-metering systems react to past traffic conditions and, thus, cannot effectively prevent flow-breakdowns. The Seattle control system is developed to overcome this problem [19]. The Seattle system defines a bottleneck as a congested freeway section in which the occupancy is higher than 18% and the I/O flow difference is positive. A predictive algorithm runs in each ramp controller to predict bottlenecks before they actually form. Upstream entrance ramps resolves bottlenecks cooperatively. <p> A statistical pattern recognition technique identifies current traffic conditions for flow breakdown prediction. Reportedly, the downstream loop occupancy averaged over the past minute of the target freeway section, and the I/O difference of the downstream section lagged two minutes composes the best pattern <ref> [19] </ref>. Historical traffic patterns that actually led to flow breakdowns are collected and grouped in the pattern space. The patterns are then labeled as having a high probability of flow breakdown two minutes later. <p> Chen and May [3], for example, presented a scheme in which they employ a fuzzy definition of control area. They do not control congestion occurring outside the boundary of control area until the impact of the congestion propagates to the control area. The bottleneck algorithm <ref> [19] </ref> determines the control area dynamically according to the severity of congestion. This algorithm determines ramp metering rates solely by detection (or prediction) of bottlenecks, implying that the system meters a ramp only when it detects congestion. <p> We use a stochastic model based pattern recognition technique to capture sequences of traffic patterns for flow-breakdown prediction. Our breakdown prediction algorithm is fundamentally different from the existing solutions such as the one proposed by Nihan and Berg <ref> [19] </ref>. Our solution improves the bottleneck prediction algorithm by making prediction based on sequences of traffic data instead of snapshots. We can also use our prediction scheme to predict interdependent events which is impossible with existing schemes.

Reference-contexts: We discuss two classical examples here: the Culebra entrance ramp-metering system in San Antonio, Texas [16] and the Junction 10 ramp-metering system on freeway M6, Birmingham, Britain <ref> [20] </ref>. The Texas Transportation Institute developed the Culebra entrance ramp metering system [16] on the southbound IH 10 freeway in San Antonio, Texas. This ramp metering system was the first system of its kind in the State of Texas. The main implementation objective was efficient and reliable remote control. <p> Since the system controls only one entrance ramp, its performance effect has been minimal. On-line test results show that traffic conditions on the freeway have not significantly changed by the ramp control scheme. A similar system was installed on Junction 10 of M6 freeway near Birmingham, Britain, 1986 <ref> [20] </ref>. This system controlled the ramp signal by a stage selection algorithm in which the stage is a duration of a red/green signal.

Reference-contexts: It reduced significantly the average travel time on upstream and downstream sections of the metered ramp. It also significantly increased the traffic flow at the downstream sections. Despite the improved average traffic conditions, flow breakdowns occurred continuously at the installation site. Papageorgiou et al. <ref> [21] </ref> proposed a feedback-control based approach called ALINEA. The ALINEA approach views traffic flow as the process being controlled and the on-ramp rate is the control variable. By deriving the feedback control law, we set the ramp metering rate so traffic flow will not exceed system capacity.

It uses an advisory metering <ref> [28] </ref> which informs drivers of the traffic condition and the availability of less congested alternate routes through traffic signs. 59 Some algorithms only take the current congestion condition into account without consid-ering the condition of upstream sections of the congested area.

Reference-contexts: They used a linear programming model, which was proposed initially by Wattleworth <ref> [30] </ref>, as the basic technique to search for optimal ramp metering rates.

Reference-contexts: The major disadvantage of this approach is that they control entrance ramps independently ignoring interdependencies with other ramps and, thus, may not be effective in dissipating congestion. Wattleworth presented a scheme <ref> [31] </ref> in which he proposed to solve the congestion dissipation problem using a linear programming model. He employs this model both in congested and non-congested situations. In congested situations, a revised capacity flow rate replaces the free-flow capacity in the linear programming model; then, new desired merging rates are calculated.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the queuing analysis considers possible detouring of vehicles on a ramp queue. Messer and Chang used the Origin-Destination matrix to estimate the corresponding coefficients. We can define the Origin-Destination matrix using the geometric structure of freeway and historical information on the drivers' routes <ref> [1, 18, 32] </ref>. Simulations on real traffic data show that Messer and Chang's algorithm has a better performance than other similar optimization algorithms [17]. By using their approach, we can optimize ramp metering rates under some conditions; the implementation is comparatively simple. <p> Here we briefly review some existing techniques to estimate the O-D trip tables <ref> [18, 32] </ref> and then present our method. Let O i denote the total number of trips entering the entrance ramp of S i , and D j denote the total number of trips departing the exit ramp of S j within a time period. <p> That is, the basic assumption of this model is that the number of vehicles entering from entrance ramps to an exit ramp is proportional to traffic volume at these entrance points <ref> [32] </ref>. This method is very simple since we can estimate the O-D tables by observing traffic flows at entrance and exit ramps. The proportional distribution model, considers neither distance nor travel time. <p> To remedy this deficiency, Nihan [18] proposed the Gamma distribution to model the travel distances of freeway motorists. Geometric characteristics such as shopping malls or sports stadiums may affect the accuracy of this method. Willis and May <ref> [32] </ref> developed another O-D model in which they determined the likelihood of a driver departing from a freeway by the time difference between traveling along freeway or the frontage road to reflect physical conditions of the frontage road and the freeway system. <p> Cremer and Keller <ref> [32] </ref> proposed an algorithm which can dynamically produce the transition probabilities based on measured deviations of traffic volume on both entrance ramps and exit ramps.
