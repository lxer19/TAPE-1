Title: Gilt Reference Manual: A Simple Interface Builder for Garnet  
Author: Brad A. Myers

Abstract: Gilt is a simple interface layout tool that helps the user design dialog boxes. It allows the user to place pre-defined Garnet gadgets in a window and then save them to a file. There are two versions: one for Garnet look-and-feel gadgets and one for Motif look-and-feel gadgets. This research was sponsored by NCCOSC under Contract No. N66001-94-C-6037, Arpa Order No. B326.

Reference-contexts: You can toggle between the standard and Motif gadget palettes by selecting "Load Other Gadgets" from the main Gilt menubar. the window are shown. The check boxes are selected. Page 508 Gilt Gilt Chapter 1 There is a more powerful interactive design tool in Garnet called Lapidary <ref> [Myers 89] </ref>. Lapidary allows new gadgets to be constructed from scratch, and allows application-specific graphics to be created without programming. However, Lapidary does not support the placement of the existing Garnet gadgets. 1.2. Loading Gilt Gilt is not automatically loaded when you load Garnet.
