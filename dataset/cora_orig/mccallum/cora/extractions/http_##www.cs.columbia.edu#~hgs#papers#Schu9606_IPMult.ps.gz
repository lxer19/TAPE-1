Abstract: This paper gives practical information along with theoretical background on Multicube project design decisions for scalable and reliable multicast service facilitating multimedia interworking of real users over the European ATM pilot. IP multicast mapping is proposed to be performed with the use of a minimal address resolution server serving a special multicast LIS within the ATM LAN. The feasibility of this choice is proved partly by practical experiment partly via simulation. Data applications for CSCW scenarios depend on a reliable information transfer. The Multicube project selected Xy, an X application sharing tool, to study the reliable multicast services provided by the protocols MTP, RMP and SRM.

Reference-contexts: This, however, requires additional mappings and address resolutions. The paper discusses alternatives and reasons behind the current decision for the Multicube project <ref> [1] </ref>. The objective of Multicube is to develop, test and validate an ATM-based multipoint infrastructure for the support of CSCW applications. It is a trial-oriented project with the participation of end users from the automotive and aerospace industry. The majority of their multicast applications are IP based.

Reference-contexts: Mapping of IP multicast to ATM point-to-multipoint connections . This effort is intended to propose and validate efficient mechanism for IP multicast applications over ATM LANs interconnected via public ATM network. We propose a minimal (as compared to G. Armitage's MARS <ref> [2] </ref>) multicast address resolution server (mARS). mARS supports multipoint-to-multipoint connections and leaf initiated join for UNI 3.1 and 4.0. Its extension supports different QoS levels for the same multicast group. <p> Implementation Issues The following implementation alternatives were considered within the project: FORE SPANS signalling, FORE UNI 3.0 signalling, Vendor Independent Network Control Entity (VINCE) by ARPA and NRL, and Q.port (Portable ATM Signalling Software) by Bellcore. Its important to mention here that the multicast capable MARS <ref> [2] </ref> by G. Armitage is available as public domain software in a source code except the Q.port. Almost all of the project participants are using FORE equipment on their premises, therefore dependence on a different signalling was considered as a disadvantage.

Reference-contexts: that archive all preceding messages for replay at the latecomer become prohibitive, because it would make join latency for the new participant a function of the previous duration of the conference. 2.2 Xy - an X Application Sharing Tool Multicube selected for its experiments the X application sharing tool Xy <ref> [5] </ref>. The basic idea for Xy is to use an displayless X server as part of the distributed sharing component. This Xy server does not control I/O devices directly, but interacts with Xy agents local to the participant (see Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: This feature gives mobility to participants who can close a session on one machine and resume it on another. 2.3 Reliable Multicast Protocols A large collection of proposals for reliable multicast protocols has been developed in recent years <ref> [6] </ref>. The service that they provide differs in adopted acknowledgement strategy, order preserving capabilities, supported atomicity and flow control. Coordination between senders and receivers can be done explicitly by positive acknowledgement as it is done e.g. in TCP for the unicast case.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 1 Xy Architecture experiments, Multicube has chosen three protocols that will be compared for supporting X application sharing sessions: MTP, RMP and SRM. 2.3.1 MTP - Multicast Transport Protocol The Multicast Transport Protocol was defined in RFC 1301 <ref> [7] </ref>. It describes a protocol for reliable transport that utilizes the multicast capability of lower layer networking architectures. MTP is based on a token scheme and can provide atomicity and total ordering service. A group under MTP is known as a web .

Reference-contexts: During that time, consumers can send NACKs in case they detect lost packets. The master sends out message acceptance records by which atomicity of packet reception in the group is controlled. The variant of MTP that will be used in Multicube is the protocol named MTP-2 <ref> [8] </ref>, which offers improvements in functionality and efficiency. MTP-2 adds recovery procedures for master failures and migration of the master side. Beside total ordering MTP-2 can also support weaker notions of message order.

Reference-contexts: Beside total ordering MTP-2 can also support weaker notions of message order. MTP-2 has been implemented in user mode and as a kernel driver for SunOS 5. 2.3.2 RMP - Reliable Multicast Protocol Reliable Multicast Protocol (RMP) <ref> [9] </ref> provides a reliable multicast service on top of the unreliable multicast datagram of IP multicasting. It is based on a token ring technique and uses a combination of positive and negative acknowledgements (ACKs/NACKs) for error detection and delivery confirmation.

Reference-contexts: With special request packets, membership changes are signalled to the group members. RMP offers flow and congestion control based on a modified sliding window protocol similar to the algorithms used in TCP. 2.3.3 SRM (Scalable Reliable Multicast) SRM (Scalable Reliable Multicast) <ref> [10] </ref> is not a fixed protocol but more of a framework in which reliable multicast services can be realized. The design of SRM is based on the idea of application level framing (ALF) and lightweight sessions. Under ALF functionality and flexibility is left to the application as much as possible.

Reference-contexts: The adaptation of the SRM framework to X application sharing will be an important outcome of the experiments on X application sharing in Multicube. 3. Mapping of IP multicast to ATM point-to-multipoint connections 3.1 A Minimal Address Resolution Server Convergence of IP and ATM service models <ref> [11] </ref> will require a full IP service over ATM: multicast group management (IGMP [12, 13]), multicast flow distribution with receiver initiated joins, leaves, and QoS specifications.

Reference-contexts: Table 1 gives an overview of the IP multicasting over ATM problem area. A Minimal Address Resolution Server (mARS) was proposed in <ref> [16] </ref> for the MULTICUBE consortium partners to enable IP multicast experimentation over the European ATM pilot. Interconnection of the partners ATM islands could be achieved with the use of PVCs or with a specially designed type of call facilitating multipoint-to-multipoint connections in a public ATM network.

Reference-contexts: This is possible because the ForeRunner SBA-200 ATM SBus adapter inside the workstation serves also as a router between different connected LISs. 3.2 Simulation results The above schemes were simulated within the discrete event domain of the Ptolemy modelling tool <ref> [17] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: According to <ref> [18] </ref> C = 100 calls/s. The load is produced by FORE IP for a broadcast ARP. Independent parameters for each run of the simulation are: Unicast Call Load ( UCL ) and Multicast Call Load ( MCL ). <p> These coefficients were measured in the GMD FOKUS IP over ATM environment; details on simulation tuning and organisation could be found in [20]. According to <ref> [18] </ref> the CLS service is considered to have a lower priority for an SCP in comparison with connections establishment.

Reference-contexts: ARP overhead shown by simulation is considered less harmful than completely inefficient bandwidth utilisation in case of mesh. This solution was implemented within the networking infrastructure of GMD FOKUS and demonstrated with the use of integrated multimedia conferencing tool isc <ref> [19] </ref>. The lessons learned so far on implementation are as follows: Multicast applications can run successfully within the FORE IP logical subnetworks in parallel with the ClIP LIS, coexisting for the same physical structure.
