Reference-contexts: As above, these proofs are constructive and give quadratic-time algorithms. It is still an open question whether every graph embeddable in the torus is (4; 1)-colorable. Finally, Archdeacon <ref> [1] </ref>, showed that for every genus g, there always exists a d = d (g), such that every graph embeddable on a surface of genus g is (3; d)-colorable. (The value of d has since been improved by [10].) - 2 - Our results.

Proof. Follows immediately from the result of <ref> [2] </ref>, since it is easy to transform a (; d)- coloring of a graph G into an ((d + 1); 0) coloring of G, by simply d + 1 coloring each color class.

Reference-contexts: These impossibility results for general graphs do not, of course, rule out good algorithms for defective coloring of bounded-degree graphs.

Reference-contexts: This generalization of + 1 coloring to defect then allows us to give polynomial-time approximation algorithms for defective coloring, in the spirit of Widgerson [25], and others who improved his bounds <ref> [5, 17, 18] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Pick a threshold ffi. Take the node of highest degree and 2 color its neighborhood with two new colors. Remove its neighborhood. Continue until all nodes have degree at most ffi. Then we can ffi color the remaining graph by Brooks' Theorem <ref> [6] </ref>. Each round we eliminate at least ffi nodes using 2 colors, so the total number of colors used is 2n=ffi + ffi. We now show how to modify this allowing for some defect, d.

Reference-contexts: We remark that the (3,2) coloring proof is constructive, and immediately implies an n 2 algorithm for (3,2) coloring planar graphs (just as the proof of the 5-color theorem is constructive, and immediately implies an n 2 algorithm| improved by <ref> [8, 13, 23, 26] </ref> to a linear-time algorithm.)

Reference-contexts: This paper is concerned with relaxing the coloring problem in an additional way, namely we relax the requirement that each color class be an independent set. Cowen, Cowen and Woodall <ref> [9] </ref> first introduced the notion of coloring with defects as follows. Definition 1.1 A (k; d) coloring of a graph G, is a coloring of the vertices of G with k colors, such that each vertex is adjacent to at most d vertices of the same color. <p> Previous work. Cowen, Cowen and Woodall <ref> [9] </ref> give a complete characterization of all k and d such that every planar graph is (k; d)-colorable. <p> Determining whether a planar graph is 3-colorable is NP-complete. In theory, the 4-color theorem gives a quadratic time algorithm for 4-coloring planar graphs (although the constants are worse than terrible). Since, as was remarked in the introduction, <ref> [9] </ref> give a quadratic-time algorithm to (3; 2)-color any planar graph, together with the results of this section, this characterizes the complexity of defective coloring in the plane. Theorem 2.1 To determine whether or not a planar graph is (2; d)-colorable is N P -complete.

(The value of d has since been improved by <ref> [10] </ref>.) - 2 - Our results. In this paper we prove hardness results and give approximation algorithms for defective coloring. We show, perhaps surprisingly, that determining if a graph is (2; d) colorable is NP-complete for d 1, even for planar graphs.

Reference-contexts: The paper concludes with some open problems. 2 Hardness results We show in this section that determining whether or not a graph is (2; d) colorable is NP-complete, even for planar graphs (extending a result of <ref> [11] </ref> that first showed (2; 1) coloring is NP-complete in general graphs). However, we show that the (2; 1)-colorable planar graphs are easy to 4-color in quadratic time.

Pick a threshold ffi. <p> For instance, if we let d = n 1=3 we obtain a (2 p coloring, a substantial reduction in colors from the algorithm of Widgerson. However, the bounds Widgerson achieved for approximate coloring have since been improved, most recently by <ref> [18] </ref>. We next show how to get a similar tradeoff for the new and better approximation algorithms of Karger, Motwani and Sudan [18]. We use the semidefinite program approach of [18] to obtain a vector 3-coloring. We then round to an integer defective coloring. <p> However, the bounds Widgerson achieved for approximate coloring have since been improved, most recently by <ref> [18] </ref>.

Finally, we generalize to -colorable graphs. 4.1 Generalizing the KMS algorithm to defects The approximation algorithms of [18] work as follows. First, the 3-coloring problem is relaxed to the vector 3-coloring problem, which is solved in polynomial time using semidefinite programming. The vector 3-coloring assigns unit vectors to the vertices so that two vertices adjacent in the graph have dot product 1 2 . <p> As expected from the impossibility results of [22], the rounding step involves an exponential blowup in the number of colors, but the bounds achieved by <ref> [18] </ref> are still much improved from [25]. The randomized methods in [18] work by transforming the vector coloring into a semi-coloring, which is an assignment of colors to the n vertices, so that the set of vertices which are not properly colored is of size less than n=4. <p> As expected from the impossibility results of [22], the rounding step involves an exponential blowup in the number of colors, but the bounds achieved by <ref> [18] </ref> are still much improved from [25]. The randomized methods in [18] work by transforming the vector coloring into a semi-coloring, which is an assignment of colors to the n vertices, so that the set of vertices which are not properly colored is of size less than n=4. <p> This bears a great deal of superficial resemblance to defective coloring already, because it allows (many) defective (i.e. monochromatic) edges. However, the <ref> [18] </ref> semicoloring is a global condition on defects that will, in general, not place any guarantee on the maximum local defect (note that the angle between the vectors corresponding to two non-adjacent neighbors of a vertex will often be forced to be very small, to satisfy nearby edge constraints. <p> However, we can do somewhat better by noticing that the neighborhood of a vertex in a - colorable graph is vector 1 colorable (see <ref> [18] </ref>), and we can set a degree threshold ffi (i) for each (i) , so that we recursively approximately 1 defective color the neighborhood of vertices of degree greater than ffi (i) , and then ( ~ O (( ffi (i) d ) log ff 2 ); d) color the remainder <p> We note also that it is similarly straightforward to generalize the alternate vector-projection rounding schemes of <ref> [18] </ref> to defects, using the fact that the probability that t random centers fail to cut an edge is approximately t (=2) , to construct a d-defective semicoloring. <p> Another question is to look at alternate definitions of defective coloring. One possibility would be to allow some total number of monochromatic edges, rather than the stronger requirement of a maximum threshold of monochromatic edges at each vertex. This is akin to the concept of semi-coloring introduced by <ref> [18] </ref> (and the tradeoff between global defect and number of colors used in this case is fairly straightforward from their analysis.) This global threshold on defects does not make much sense for the scheduling application we mentioned in the introduction, but the scheduling problem suggests several alternate generalizations of defective coloring.

Reference-contexts: Determining the chromatic number of G, the minimum number of colors needed to properly color G, is NP-hard. It remains NP-hard even to determine if a planar graph is 3-colorable [15]. Even the relaxation of the problem to approximate coloring is hard, in the sense that <ref> [22] </ref> using results of [2, 12] showed that there exists an * &gt; 0 such that no polynomial time algorithm can n * -approximate the chromatic number unless P = NP . (in [3] the value of * is improved under different hardness assumptions). <p> We show determining if a planar graph is (3; 1) colorable is also NP-Complete, and in general graphs we show that (k; d) coloring is NP-Complete for all k 3, and all d 0. A simple reduction from proper coloring and the result of <ref> [22] </ref> shows that for any constant defect d, there exists an * &gt; 0 such that (the chromatic number) cannot be approximated within a factor of n * unless P = N P . <p> We show determining if a planar graph is (3; 1) colorable is also NP-Complete, and in general graphs we show that (k; d) coloring is NP-Complete for all k 3, and all d 0.

As expected from the impossibility results of <ref> [22] </ref>, the rounding step involves an exponential blowup in the number of colors, but the bounds achieved by [18] are still much improved from [25].

Reference-contexts: Theorem 2.1 To determine whether or not a planar graph is (2; d)-colorable is N P -complete.

The fact that (2; d)- colorability is in NP should be obvious. We will show for any 3-CNF , there exists a - 3 - graph G constructible in polynomial time such that is satisfiable if and only if G is (2; d)-colorable.

We will use Theorem 3.4 to show, in the next section, in analogous way to how Widgerson <ref> [25] </ref>, and others [5, 18] have used + 1 coloring, to give polynomial-time approximation algorithms for coloring 3-colorable and k-colorable graphs. - 7 - 4 Approximate Defective Coloring Widgerson gives the following algorithm to approximately color 3-colorable graphs. Pick a threshold ffi. <p> As expected from the impossibility results of [22], the rounding step involves an exponential blowup in the number of colors, but the bounds achieved by [18] are still much improved from <ref> [25] </ref>. The randomized methods in [18] work by transforming the vector coloring into a semi-coloring, which is an assignment of colors to the n vertices, so that the set of vertices which are not properly colored is of size less than n=4.

Reference-contexts: We remark that the (3,2) coloring proof is constructive, and immediately implies an n 2 algorithm for (3,2) coloring planar graphs (just as the proof of the 5-color theorem is constructive, and immediately implies an n 2 algorithm| improved by <ref> [8, 13, 23, 26] </ref> to a linear-time algorithm.) Recently, [10] have extended this to toroidal graphs, and show that every toroidal graph is (3; 2) and (5; 1)-colorable. As above, these proofs are constructive and give quadratic-time algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Definition 1.1 A (k; d) coloring of a graph G, is a coloring of the vertices of G with k colors, such that each vertex is adjacent to at most d vertices of the same color. This has been an active area of current research in graph theory <ref> [27, 14] </ref>. Notice that (k; 0) coloring corresponds to proper coloring. <p> These impossibility results for general graphs do not, of course, rule out good algorithms for defective coloring of bounded-degree graphs. In Section 3 we present a generalization of + 1 coloring to defects, that follows from results of Lovasz and others <ref> [21, 7, 20, 4, 27] </ref>. As a corollary, we show that any cubic graph can be (2; 1)-colored in linear time, as well as obtaining other degree-based results. <p> This is an O () coloring of G when d is constant. - 6 - 3 A generalization of + 1 coloring This section begins with a generalization of +1 coloring to defects that has been discovered and re-discovered many times in the literature <ref> [21, 7, 20, 4, 27] </ref>. The first reference we know of, is due to Lovasz.
