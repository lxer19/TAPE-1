When our first researcher arrived in January we didn't yet have our own officesthose involved with BRICS were rather scattered. We now have over forty researchers associated to BRICS and our own two corridors within the Computer Science department in Aarhus, as well a smaller BRICS contingent in Aalborg. We are well equipped with machines, and well staffed with energetic young researchers, who are responsible in no small measure for BRICS' success, socially and intellectually. This year has seen the successful completion of one research theme in Complexity Theory and an excellent start to another, Logic in Semantics, which continues into '95. There have been numerous BRICS seminars and courses. To date we have 48 BRICS research reports. The companion series of BRICS notes is for less polished but nevertheless important material, often associated with the courses we hold. A start is being made on a BRICS lectures notes series; the intention here is to produce high quality lecture notes on topics in the foundations of Computer Science which are to be freely available for Computer Science and Mathematics departments worldwide. In some respects we are still finding our way, of course. However all in all we are pleased with how things are developing, and look forward to another exciting year.

Reference-contexts: In retrospect, it was a happy miracle that the lattice we had for the proof actually satisfied the properties needed! In the end, we did manage to give proofs of those statements, but by an entirely different route, see <ref> [2] </ref>. Another frustrating experience is trying to convince people about its worth. I remember the reaction of the audience when Desh gave a Mit-tagseminar at MPI.

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, the partial order P 0 seems to propagate the prejudice that the a's are inferior to the b's. Hence, if we denote by Pr [a 1 &lt; b 1 j P 0 ] the corresponding conditional probability with the new partial order, Graham, A.C. Yao and F. Yao <ref> [3] </ref> conjectured that Pr [a 1 &lt; b 1 j P ] Pr [a 1 &lt; b 1 j P 0 ]: Shepp [7] proved this conjecture by an application of the FKG Inequality. He also discovered the following counter-intuitive curiousity.

Reference-contexts: How does that alter the state of affairs without any knowledge at all? Rival and Sands made the reasonable conjecture that the event x &lt; y for some other y is reinforced by this belief, so Pr [x &lt; y j x &lt; z] Pr [x &lt; z]: Shepp <ref> [8] </ref> used a devilishly clever application of the FKG Inequality to transform this so-called xyz-Conjecture into the xyz-Theorem.
