Reference-contexts: Assuming that all the distance constraints hold between the given structures and since we are dealing with at most three ambiguous measurements, this generally involves a small number of iterations of the algorithm. 3.2 Algorithm Details AmbiPack is an example of a branch-and-bound tree-search algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>. During the search, it prunes away branches that are ruled out by the bound function. Figure 5 illustrates the algorithm. Initially, AmbiPack selects three constraints, P i Q 0 i &lt; x i A, i = 1; 2; 3.

Reference-contexts: All constraints used involved carbon-carbon distances because they are commonly measured in solid-state NMR experiments, rather than distances to hydrogen, which are currently more common in solution NMR spectroscopy. 23 4.1 P22 Tailspike Protein The first test of the AmbiPack algorithm is the P22 tailspike protein [13] (PDB <ref> [2] </ref> code 1TSP). In its crystal structure, the positions of 544 residues are determined. The protein forms a symmetric homotrimer. Each subunit of the homotrimer contains a large parallel fi helix.

Reference-contexts: This will take a great deal of computer time even for a moderate size n, such as 30, since 30 6 = 729; 000; 000). Furthermore, this approach may miss solutions that are "between" the sampled transformations <ref> [9, 3] </ref>. So, to have a fair degree of confidence that no solutions have been missed requires very fine sampling, that is, a large value of n (generally much greater than 30). We have developed a new algorithm, AmbiPack, that generates packed structures from ambiguous (and unambiguous) intermolecular distances.

Reference-contexts: These results also suggest that experiments should be designed to obtain negative data close to the boundary of detection, thus maximizing information on the structure. For example, if a small set of constraints is known, we can use the triangle inequality to establish upper bounds on other distances <ref> [4] </ref>. Further experiments can be directed towards measurements with small upper bounds.

Reference-contexts: For every atom P in S, T (P ) is taken as the center of its error sphere. There are many well-known iterative algorithms for computing transformations that minimize the sum of distances squared between two sets of points, e.g. <ref> [5] </ref>. However, in our case, since we are dealing with only three pairs of points, we can use a more efficient analytic solution. The points P i define a triangle and so do the centers of the C i .

Reference-contexts: However, for higher-order multimers, where different types of intermolecular relationships exist, each intermolecular distance remains ambiguous. Furthermore, in solid-state NMR experiments [8], one can obtain unambiguous intramolec-ular distances but generally only ambiguous intermolecular distances. This kind of problem is evident with symmetric coiled coils <ref> [6] </ref>, the trimeric P22 tailspike protein [13], and the 3 fibrils formed from fragments of the Alzheimer precursor protein [8]. This type of ambiguity is illustrated in Figure 1 with the P22 tailspike protein, which forms a symmetric homotrimer.

Reference-contexts: The second study involves a nine-residue peptide from fi-amyloid, a small number (8) of ambiguous measurements and two different interfaces between an indefinitely repeating group of subunits. In all the tests discussed below, the AmbiPack algorithm is implemented in Common Lisp <ref> [7] </ref>, running on a Sun Ultra 1 workstation.

Reference-contexts: For instance, in the symmetric dimer case, intra- and intermolecular distances are ambiguous. This type of ambiguity can generally be removed through isotopic labeling schemes. However, for higher-order multimers, where different types of intermolecular relationships exist, each intermolecular distance remains ambiguous. Furthermore, in solid-state NMR experiments <ref> [8] </ref>, one can obtain unambiguous intramolec-ular distances but generally only ambiguous intermolecular distances. This kind of problem is evident with symmetric coiled coils [6], the trimeric P22 tailspike protein [13], and the 3 fibrils formed from fragments of the Alzheimer precursor protein [8]. <p> Furthermore, in solid-state NMR experiments <ref> [8] </ref>, one can obtain unambiguous intramolec-ular distances but generally only ambiguous intermolecular distances. This kind of problem is evident with symmetric coiled coils [6], the trimeric P22 tailspike protein [13], and the 3 fibrils formed from fragments of the Alzheimer precursor protein [8]. This type of ambiguity is illustrated in Figure 1 with the P22 tailspike protein, which forms a symmetric homotrimer. The intermolecular distances between residues 120 and 124 are short, as well as those between residues 121 and 123. <p> The more complex case is when the positive distance constraints are not all satisfied between every pair of structures. Figure 2 shows the structure of a C-terminal peptide (fi34-42) of the fi amyloid protein (fi1-42). <ref> [8] </ref> This infinitely repeating structure forms an 9 ordered aggregate. There are two types of interfaces in this structure. Solid-state 1 3C NMR experiments have produced 8 positive and 12 negative constraints. Either interface satisfies all negative constraints but only a subset of the positive ones.
