Abstract: Future computer networks are expected to provide different types of service. For this purpose, new algorithms and protocols have been proposed for gateway scheduling, flow control, and routing. The interaction between these three components is crucial to the performance of the network. Existing work has studied only the interaction between scheduling and flow control, assuming static routing. In this paper, we investigate the interaction between scheduling and adaptive routing. We view the network as a dynamical system. We apply the Liapunov direct method to derive stability conditions for the routes of different traffic classes. We show how with scheduling support for routing, the routes of the traffic classes can be isolated, thereby improving the overall network performance. Monte-carlo simulation results are also presented. fl This work is supported in part by ONR and DARPA under contract N00014-91-C-0195 to Honeywell and Com- puter Science Department at the University of Maryland, and by National Science Foundation Grant No. NCR 89-04590.

Reference-contexts: We consider a simplified situation consisting of a source node sending traffic to a destination node along two paths. The first path represents low delay routes, and the second path represents high capacity routes. We model this network as a dynamical system <ref> [1] </ref>. The state of the network is described by a tuple (x; y), where x is the number of delay-sensitive connections on the first path, and y is the number of throughput- sensitive connections (also) on the first path. <p> End of Proof From lemma 4.1 and the Liapunov stability theory [17], we have the following theorem: Theorem 4.1 For routing with FCFS scheduling, any starting state in D 1 (the shaded area in The region D 1 is called domain of attraction corresponding to the origin <ref> [1, 12] </ref> because it constitutes a set of starting states for which the iteration converges to the origin. <p> This is the domain of attraction corresponding to (N; 0). Figure 8 (b) shows the domain of attraction for routing with TOSQ. These results are for N = 20; M = 30; and ff (k) * <ref> [0:8; 1] </ref>. We note that for routing with FCFS, the simulation results in Figure 8 (a) agree exactly with the analytic results shown in Figure 7 (a).

Reference-contexts: At any instant, we describe the state of the network by the tuple (x; y), where x is the number of delay-sensitive connections on path 1, and y is the number of throughput-sensitive connections on path 1. To model routing updates, we use a discrete-time flow approach as in <ref> [2] </ref>. We assume that (some or all) connections periodically update their routes to D every 4 time units, where 4 is long enough for the network to reach steady-state after a routing update.

Reference-contexts: The explanation given there is as follows: It is well known that delay-based routing does not perform well at high load when queueing delay is a significant part of measured link delay, which consists of queueing, transmission, and propagation delays <ref> [11, 8, 3] </ref>. This is mainly because from the classical delay-utilization curve, around saturation, a small increase in utilization corresponds 1 to a large increase in link delay. This dramatic change can result in the link becoming unattractive and thus being avoided by all delay-sensitive sources. <p> These values are the same with both FCFS and TOSQ. We note that this is consistent with results in <ref> [3] </ref>, which show that the asynchronous routing updates at different nodes improves the performance of delay-based routing.

We consider a network supporting two traffic classes: delay-sensitive traffic such as interactive traffic or real-time traffic (e.g. audio), and throughput-sensitive traffic such as FTP traffic. <p> In TOSQ, each traffic class is assigned to a separate queue at the output link. The link bandwidth is allocated equally between the two queues in a round-robin fashion. (TOSQ is similar to the recently proposed fair-queueing discipline <ref> [6] </ref>, except that in fair-queueing, the link bandwidth is divided equally amongst the connections using the link, rather than the types of service.) Regarding the routing component, routes for each traffic class are computed using some link cost. <p> The second reason for using monte-carlo simulations is to obtain convergence times. We show that routing with TOSQ converges to isolation much faster than routing with FCFS. We point out that, in general, related disciplines to TOSQ such as fair-queueing <ref> [6] </ref> and other rate-based scheduling disciplines 1 have shown several advantages over FCFS in their interaction with flow control (e.g. [6, 10]). Thus, gateways with such scheduling disciplines can also improve the routing by exploiting the scheduling structure when calculating link costs for the different types of service. <p> We show that routing with TOSQ converges to isolation much faster than routing with FCFS.

This dramatic change can result in the link becoming unattractive and thus being avoided by all delay-sensitive sources. <p> Because delay-sensitive packets have a lower queueing delay under TOSQ, the measured link delay becomes dominated by transmission and propagation delays. Thus, the reported delay link costs do not change dramatically and the delay metric remains a good indicator of expected link delay after updating the routes <ref> [11] </ref>. This improves the performance of delay-based routing of delay-sensitive packets and results in more stable routes for that traffic class. Meanwhile, the link utilization metric makes the throughput-sensitive traffic move away from the delay-sensitive traffic, taking the under-utilized routes.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, non-convergence indicates that the system oscillates between different routing patterns (or has chaotic behavior). Note that I is not a continuous mapping, and well-known theorems for convergence requiring this property can not be applied <ref> [12] </ref>. Isolation corresponds to a stable state where every delay-sensitive connection stays on path 1, and every throughput-sensitive connection stays on path 2. This is equivalent to say that our iterative method converges to the fixed point (N; 0). <p> End of Proof From lemma 4.1 and the Liapunov stability theory [17], we have the following theorem: Theorem 4.1 For routing with FCFS scheduling, any starting state in D 1 (the shaded area in The region D 1 is called domain of attraction corresponding to the origin <ref> [1, 12] </ref> because it constitutes a set of starting states for which the iteration converges to the origin.

Reference-contexts: Routes, and hence the network state, are updated at discrete time instants (k + 1)4, k = 0; 1; 2; . Let (x (k); y (k)) be the network state immediately after time k4. At an update instant (k + 1)4, we use steady-state M=M=1 results <ref> [13] </ref> to estimate link costs based on (x (k); y (k)). Using these link costs, routes are updated and consequently the new network state (x (k + 1); y (k + 1)) is obtained.

Reference-contexts: The link cost for delay-sensitive traffic depends on the link scheduling discipline. With FCFS, it is the measured link delay. With TOSQ, it is the measured delay that is experienced by delay-sensitive packets only. This type-of-service network was recently studied in <ref> [15] </ref> via discrete-event simulation (a subset of the NSFNET-T1-Backbone topology was considered). It was shown that routing with TOSQ performs significantly better than routing with FCFS in a typical situation where the proportion of delay-sensitive traffic is small compared to the throughput-sensitive traffic [9].

Reference-contexts: We first obtain sufficient conditions on the system parameters (e.g. link capacities, propagation delays, total number of connections, etc.) to reach isolation, independent of the starting state and ff. We then apply the Liapunov direct method <ref> [17] </ref> to obtain more refined sufficient conditions for isolation as a function of the starting state; i.e. these conditions define a region of convergence to 2 isolation. (In a real network, the starting state would be the result of arrivals of new connections, departures of old connections, failure/recovery of links, etc.) <p> I is a mapping from a set G into itself, where G = f (x; y) : 0 x N ^ 0 y M g. The sequence of points (x (1); y (1)); (x (2); y (2)); : : : is called the trajectory of the system <ref> [14, 17] </ref>. The trajectory may or may not converge to a fixed point (x fl ; y fl ), i.e. (x fl ; y fl ) = I (x fl ; y fl ). The convergence to a fixed point indicates that the system stabilizes into a particular routing pattern. <p> Thus, these conditions capture more information; i.e. there can be a system configuration that does not satisfy the sufficient conditions of Theorem 3.1, but still reaches isolation for some starting states or values of ff (k). We use the Liapunov second (direct) method <ref> [17] </ref>. This method allows us to obtain sufficient conditions for stability and convergence to a fixed point without actually solving the system equations. <p> Consequently, starting at any point in D 1 , the trajectory stays inside D 1 approaching the origin (as shown in Figure 5). End of Proof From lemma 4.1 and the Liapunov stability theory <ref> [17] </ref>, we have the following theorem: Theorem 4.1 For routing with FCFS scheduling, any starting state in D 1 (the shaded area in The region D 1 is called domain of attraction corresponding to the origin [1, 12] because it constitutes a set of starting states for which the iteration converges <p> The proof of the above lemma is similar to the proof of Lemma 4.1, and is given in the Appendix. From lemma 4.2 and the Liapunov stability theory <ref> [17] </ref>, we have the following theorem: 12 Theorem 4.2 For routing with TOSQ scheduling, assuming C eff 1 (k) C 1 0:5y (k), any starting state in D 2 (the shaded area in Figure 6) leads to the origin, regardless of the values of ff (k).
