Abstract: This paper analyses the relation between the use of similarity in Memory-Based Learning and the notion of backed-off smoothing in statistical language modeling. We show that the two approaches are closely related, and we argue that feature weighting methods in the Memory-Based paradigm can offer the advantage of automatically specifying a suitable domain-specific hierarchy between most specific and most general conditioning information without the need for a large number of parameters. We report two applications of this approach: PP-attachment and POS-tagging. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both domains, and allows the easy integration of diverse information sources, such as rich lexical repre sentations.

Reference-contexts: The k-NN algorithm with this metric, and equal weighting for all features is called ib1 <ref> (Aha et al., 1991) </ref>. Usually k is set to 1. (X; Y ) = i=1 where: ffi (x i ; y i ) = 0 if x i = y i ; else 1 (2) This metric simply counts the number of (mis)matching feature values in both patterns.
