Abstract: Toward the direction of supporting an end-to-end video-on-demand (VOD) system with guaranteed quality over ATM networks, this paper introduces our efforts to solve this challenging problem from the source: building VOD servers. One of the performance objectives of building VOD servers is to support the maximum number of concurrent video streams with acceptable quality of services (e.g., guaranteed delay, bandwidth, and jitter). We have designed and implemented a controllable software architecture for a VOD server. With the proposed software architecture, the design issues for the storage, processing and network subsystems have been addressed. We have investigated several disk striping schemes in the storage subsystem. The impact of these disk striping schemes on the utilization of system resources has been measured. For the processing component, we have observed that additional concurrent video streams can be supported by using efficient memory interleaving. Buffering with a large memory space in the processing subsystem is a common technique to alleviate the latency variance of accessing different system components. By employing user-level control and scheduling, the variance can be decreased and therefore the resulting buffer space for each video stream is reduced. For the network subsystem, we have adopted a server-driven approach for investigating the MPEG-2 video delivery over the ATM networks. The VOD server controls the pace of video transmission and reduces the complexity of the clients. Since the client only has limited buffer space because of the cost consideration, we have reduced the buffer requirement by regulating the transmission based on the timing information embedded in MPEG-2 streams. Our research and experimental results are based on a VOD server which is under construction. The current prototype server is based on an SGI shared-memory multiprocessor with a mass storage system which consists of RAID-3 and RAID-5 disk arrays. Using 30 RAID-3 disk arrays, preliminary experimental results show that it can potentially support more than 360 high-quality video streams with careful design and coordination of the different system components.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Video-On-Demand (VOD) service is an essential component of many multimedia applications. The service allows geographically distributed users to interactively access video files from remote VOD servers <ref> [1, 10, 8] </ref>. Users can request videos from a server at any time and enjoy the flexible control of video playback with VCR-like functions, such as pause, resume, fast forward/rewind and others. <p> Scheduling and reservations can be accomplished using kernel or user-level implementations. To provide real-time scheduling and resource reservation in kernel-level requires major modification or extension to current operating systems and file systems <ref> [1, 8] </ref>. An alternative solution is to implement the required scheduling schemes and resource reservation mechanism in user space to augment current operating systems. We have proposed and implemented a controllable software architecture for VOD servers [5, 6, 7].

Reference-contexts: This figure shows a general architecture of a high-performance computer configured into three major components: storage subsystem, processing and routing component and network subsystem. The storage subsystem can be a hierarchical structure consisting of larger number of disk drives (or disk arrays <ref> [2] </ref>), CD-ROM juke-boxes, and magnetic or optical tape drives. In this paper, video files are stored in an array of disk devices or disk arrays [2] with high bandwidth and storage support. <p> The storage subsystem can be a hierarchical structure consisting of larger number of disk drives (or disk arrays <ref> [2] </ref>), CD-ROM juke-boxes, and magnetic or optical tape drives. In this paper, video files are stored in an array of disk devices or disk arrays [2] with high bandwidth and storage support. The interaction of the above three system components can be described as the following: In order to support a large number of concurrent video accesses, video files are usually archived in the storage subsystem according to data striping schemes for supporting concurrent accesses.

Reference-contexts: Videos compressed with the MPEG-2 (Moving Picture Experts Group) format require a range of 4 to 20 megabits per second bandwidth (Mbps). Besides the high-bandwidth requirement, videos must also be delivered to the user and displayed at a constant bit rate <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. In order to provide jitter-free continuous video playback, each video frame must be sent to the user before the time that it needs to be displayed.

In order to provide jitter-free continuous video playback, each video frame must be sent to the user before the time that it needs to be displayed. <p> In the current version, the NAP allocates and locks two dedicated buffers for each video stream (i.e., we call this buffering scheme the two-buffer scheme in <ref> [4] </ref>). One buffer is for receiving the video block from the SCP and the other is to deliver the video block to the NCP. A NAP also has the responsibility to guarantee the delivery rate. <p> First, a reasonable buffering scheme need to be adopted. In order to guarantee the application performance, we implemented the two-buffer scheme <ref> [4] </ref> in the experiments. One buffer is used for the retrieval of the video frames from the storage subsystem and the other buffer for the transmission of video frames to the remote clients. <p> Software solutions are flexible, however, the performance is typically bounded by the hardware configuration.

Reference-contexts: An alternative solution is to implement the required scheduling schemes and resource reservation mechanism in user space to augment current operating systems. We have proposed and implemented a controllable software architecture for VOD servers <ref> [5, 6, 7] </ref>. The software architecture uses user-level processes to provide scheduling, manage the VOD server and regulate the usage of system resources in the processing component. Some special processes are used to control the storage subsystem for the required bandwidth of video streams. <p> The operating system also can not handle large data transfer efficiently because the file systems often limit request sizes to far below what is necessary for obtaining adequate performance. Our observed un-predictable latency performance from the Unix file system can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. Because of the un-predictable performance of traditional file systems, we propose to design new video file systems to support VOD applications. We adopt a bottom-up approach, whereby we build the file system from the scratch by accessing the raw storage devices. <p> We have studied the effect of data striping schemes on the performance of a VOD server in previous work <ref> [5] </ref>. Two striping schemes are presented here: logical volume striping and application-level striping. Logical Volume Stripping A logical volume is a storage entity which behaves like a traditional disk partition, but its storage may span several physical devices. <p> Software solutions are flexible, however, the performance is typically bounded by the hardware configuration.

Reference-contexts: Since a RAID-3 requires a large enough block size (e.g., greater than 256 KByte) to achieve a high transfer rate <ref> [9] </ref>, we set the block size equal to 16 video frames, and each video frame has a worst-case 32 KByte frame size. The goal is to find which disk striping scheme supports more concurrent accesses with the same buffer size requirement.

The minimum rate and buffer requirement in CBR scheme is used as a basis to compare with the PCBR transmission scheme. We call the minimum rate requirement as R CBR . As mentioned in <ref> [14] </ref>, if a rate lower than R CBR is used to deliver a video stream, the amount of video data received will be less than the amount of video data consumed, indicating a buffer starvation situation.

Reference-contexts: In 1988, the ITU chose ATM as the underlying switching and multiplexing technology for B-ISDN. A major objective of ATM was its ability to support the diverse requirements of multiple bit rate traffic sources and yet provide flexible transport and switching services in an efficient and cost-effective way <ref> [15] </ref>. The key benefits of ATM are as follows. * Efficient use of network bandwidth ATM allocates bandwidth dynamically according to need. This is referred to as "bandwidth-on-demand". ATM reserves network resources for applications based on their quality of service requirements. <p> An ATM network provides an end-to-end communication path between network devices independent of other protocols that many be running in the networked environment. For a complete technical description of ATM see <ref> [15] </ref>. 5.2 MPEG-2 over ATM Networks The design goal of our network subsystem is to deliver variable bit-rate (VBR) compressed video, such as MPEG-2, to the client with acceptable quality of services.

Interested readers for this research area can refer to <ref> [16] </ref>, for more information about the research issues in this domain. We will simply assume the network support is always guaranteed in this article. A large-scale VOD server must have a high-performance network subsystem for supporting hundreds of video streams with acceptable quality of services.

Reference-contexts: We did not exclude the possibility of implementing this architecture in the kernel level to further improve performance. We adopt the Message Queue (MQ) mechanism to support Inter-Process Communication (IPC) between different control processes <ref> [17] </ref>. The reason for choosing a Message Queue as the communication mechanism was for several reasons. First, all messages in the message queue are stored in the kernel for fast communication of messages between processes.

Reference-contexts: In order to demonstrate the effects of disk scheduling algorithm (thus possibly accommodating more streams), we reduce the video bandwidth from 8 Mbps to 4 Mbps. 4 Mbps is the average bandwidth of a typical full-size JPEG video stream using Parallax video card <ref> [18] </ref>. It is also in the range of current MPEG-2 specifications. The performance of the software architecture compared to the non-controlled scheme is depicted in Figure 8. The performance of the proposed software architecture indicates a promising result.
