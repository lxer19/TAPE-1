Abstract: The space and time complexity of a Monte Carlo "light particle" tracing radiosity algorithm is analyzed. This algorithm calculates the average irradiance on each diffuse surface in a model containing both diffuse and non-diffuse surfaces. It is shown that given certain restrictions on the physical properties of the model, that the number of particles needed to estimate these average irradiance values to within a specified variance is O(N ), where N is the number of surfaces in the model. It is further shown that for a broad class of scenes these O(N )particles can be processed in O(N

Reference-contexts: The actual error in these hierarchical solutions is unknown as their termination conditions are related to the potential error of a single interaction. Monte Carlo radiosity methods (e.g. [20, 14]), which estimate illumination by tracking random light particles, have been shown to be useful in practice <ref> [1] </ref>, but our knowledge about their error behavior and resource consumption is no more complete than our knowledge for deterministic algorithms.

Reference-contexts: In a naive implementation, the cost of casting a ray against N objects is proportional to N (i.e. it is O (N ) time 3 ). However, in practice acceleration scemes which try to achieve sub-linear speed are used (these schemes are surveyed in <ref> [2] </ref>). <p> This will double count each line (once as it "enters" and once as it "exits"), but this effect is absorbed into the arbitrary constant.

Reference-contexts: The assumption that ray casting is O (log N ) is often quoted, but so far no proof has been given to validate this assumption on non-trivial sets of objects. Ray casting using a uniform spatial subdivision has been studied by Cleary and Wyvill <ref> [4] </ref> and Devillers [6] they derived some excellent results for rays and objects that have a uniform random distribution. However, they did not address the case of the nonuniform distributions encountered in practice. <p> So if for some k and N 0 , g (N ) &lt; kf (N ) for all N N 0 then g (N ) 2 O (f (N ). 4 Our analysis here extends the work of Cleary and Wyvill <ref> [4] </ref> and Devillers [6] who used techniques similar to ours to examine the cost of ray casting for random surfaces. <p> Minkowski Sums have the following useful properties: * Minkowski Sums are commutative and associative. * If A and B are convex then A B is also convex. 6 Minkowski Sums are also referred to as augmented volumes, mixed volumes, mixed sets, and vector sums (e.g. Cleary and Wyvill <ref> [4] </ref>, Benson [3], Santalo [16], and Latombe [11]). 6 * If A 0 is a translation of A then A 0 B is a translation of A B by the same amount, and if P is a point then A P is a translation of A by P . <p> Minkowski Sums have been used previously in motion planning (e.g. [11]) and ray acceleration analysis (e.g. <ref> [4] </ref>), because they transform the difficult problem of determining if two point sets intersect into the easier problem of determining if a point is in a point set.

Reference-contexts: In section 8 we show some experimental results that imply the time constant on the 1 algorithm is not so large as to make it impractical. 2 Background There is currently only partial understanding of the error behavior and resource consumption of deterministic radioisty algorithms. Lischinsky <ref> [12] </ref> has shown that a-posteriori error bounds can be calculated for radiosity solutions that compute all O (N 2 ) form-factors. The complexity of deterministic radiosity algorithms has generally been given in terms of the number of computed interactions between surfaces.

Reference-contexts: The Computational Geometry community has studied the ray tracing problem, but their results are for worst case performance, so are either too pessimistic to predict performance on typical scenes encountered in image synthesis, or have super-linear memory usage (e.g. <ref> [13] </ref>). 3 The Particle Tracing Algorithm In this section we describe the particle shooting algorithm analyzed in this paper.

Reference-contexts: We define "radiosity" methods to be algorithms that approximate some radiometric quantity at either a discrete set of points, or average radiometric quantities over a discrete set of surfaces. This is a broad definition that includes both Monte Carlo methods (e.g. <ref> [14] </ref>) and finite element methods for sampled model with 495,000 elements. (e.g. [23]). Ideally, we would like to prove that some radios-ity algorithm that is used in practice can achieve a specified accuracy goal using linear memory and subquadratic time. <p> The actual error in these hierarchical solutions is unknown as their termination conditions are related to the potential error of a single interaction. Monte Carlo radiosity methods (e.g. <ref> [20, 14] </ref>), which estimate illumination by tracking random light particles, have been shown to be useful in practice [1], but our knowledge about their error behavior and resource consumption is no more complete than our knowledge for deterministic algorithms.

Reference-contexts: This algorithm is progressive, easily parallelizable, and can handle both diffuse and non-diffuse surfaces. It is well-suited to generating piecewise-constant solutions that can be used as a first pass in a two-pass algorithm (e.g. <ref> [15, 18] </ref>). The practicality of the method is shown in Figure 1, where a radiosity solution for 495,000 ininital surfaces is shown. In Section 2 we review some previous results in the analysis of radiosity algorithms.
