Abstract: Numerical simulation of individual open quantum systems has proven advantages over density operator computations. Quantum state diffusion with a moving basis (MQSD) provides a practical numerical simulation method which takes full advantage of the localization of quantum states into wave packets occupying small regions of classical phase space. Following and extending the original proposal of Percival, Alber and Steimle, we show that MQSD can provide a further gain over ordinary QSD and other quantum trajectory methods of many orders of magnitude in computational space and time. Because of these gains, it is even possible to calculate an open quantum system trajectory when the corresponding isolated system is intractable. MQSD is particularly advantageous where classical or semiclassical dynamics provides an adequate qualitative picture but is numerically inaccurate because of significant quantum effects. The principles are illustrated by computations for the quantum Duffing oscillator and for second harmonic generation in quantum optics. Potential applications in atomic and molecular dynamics, quantum circuits and quantum computation are suggested.

Reference-contexts: Localization and the representation of measuring apparatus are needed for comparison with the relative state or quantum jump methods. QSD theory followed from research that was motivated by the desire to find an explicit physical representation of the measurement process. Following pioneering work of Bohm and Bub <ref> [2] </ref> and Pearle [35, 36], Gisin [20] introduced a simple example of quantum state diffusion with real fluctuations that was generalized by Diosi [9] and Gisin [21]. The complex It^o form of QSD was introduced in [25].

Reference-contexts: The factors of p are a consequence of normalization conventions used in the master equation Eq. (2) which 10 differ from those commonly used in quantum optics. The master equation for this problem first appeared in <ref> [12, 13] </ref>. A direct numerical solution of the master equation for this problem is difficult because, in the Fock basis, the dimension of the effective Hilbert space is equal to the product of the photon number cutoffs in both modes and easily becomes very large.

Reference-contexts: Quantum state diffusion (QSD) provides such a numerical simulation, in which each state diffuses continuously in the state space and satisfies a nonlinear Langevin-It^o diffusion equation, determined uniquely by the master equation as shown in <ref> [25] </ref> and described in section 2. This diffusion often produces a localization of quantum states into wave packets that occupy small moving regions R of classical phase space. Such localization is a special characteristic of QSD that is usually absent in other quantum state simulation methods [16]. <p> diffusion (QSD) Quantum state diffusion represents the evolution of a quantum system through a correspondence between the solutions of the master equation for the ensemble density operator and the solutions of a Langevin-It^o diffusion equation for the normalized pure state vector j i of an individual system of the ensemble <ref> [25] </ref>. An analogy is helpful. A solution of the Langevin-It^o equation for the motion of an individual Brownian particle in position space represents a single member of an ensemble whose distribution function satisfies the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. <p> The complex Wiener process is normalized to dt, so the independent real and imaginary Wiener processes are each normalized to dt=2. This is the same normalization as in [26, 27, 38], but is different from that of <ref> [25] </ref>. The distribution (4) is invariant under unitary transformations in the linear space of the d~ m . hL m i = h jL m j i is the quantum expectation of L m for state j i. <p> This result generalizes to an arbitrary number of Lindblad operators if u is taken to be a general unitary transformation in the linear space of the Lindblad operators. The general result was first given for QSD equations in <ref> [25] </ref>, following the statement of an invariance principle by Diosi [9], and the derivation for a Fokker-Planck equation in state space in [37]. In either the traditional or QSD formulation for open systems, there is always a problem as to where to put the boundary between system and environment. <p> Often, in addition, the problem is simplified by approximating the effects of complicated environments by simple operators. Because of the localization property discussed in the next section, QSD has the property that it has no need of a separate measurement hypothesis, as shown in detail with examples in <ref> [25, 26, 27] </ref>. Measuring apparatus is just one type of environment, and its effects can be represented by simple operators. Alternatively, measurement can be represented in detail by pushing the boundary between system and environment out so far that the system includes the measuring apparatus. <p> Following pioneering work of Bohm and Bub [2] and Pearle [35, 36], Gisin [20] introduced a simple example of quantum state diffusion with real fluctuations that was generalized by Diosi [9] and Gisin [21].

The general theory of localization is treated in <ref> [25] </ref> and in [38]. The Schrodinger evolution of a system usually produces delocalization or dispersion. The interaction of the system with its environment, by contrast, produces localization. It is convenient to consider these competing processes separately before considering them together. The dispersion is well-known, since it occurs in isolated systems. <p> The opposite extreme is an open system which interacts with environment so strongly that the Schrodinger evolution can be neglected. This is a wide open system, and the theory of localization for these systems has been treated in detail in [38]. For simple systems, earlier papers <ref> [25, 26, 27] </ref> had built up a picture in which interaction with the environment produced localization, sometimes to an eigenstate of an operator corresponding to a surface in phase space, but more commonly to a state which is localized to a wave packet in phase space whose Heisenberg indeterminacy products are <p> For general open systems there is a physical competition between the dispersion due to the Hamiltonian and the localization due to the state diffusion.

Reference-contexts: Clearly the QSD method for open systems is eminently suitable for such dissipative systems. Recently Spiller and Ralph [45] applied QSD to a dissipative chaotic system. The Duffing oscillator is particularly appropriate for applying MQSD, as the classical system has been widely studied <ref> [29] </ref>. This system has also been treated quantum mechanically in the decoherent histories formalism [3, 4], which has been shown to have connections to QSD [10].

Reference-contexts: QSD theory followed from research that was motivated by the desire to find an explicit physical representation of the measurement process. Following pioneering work of Bohm and Bub [2] and Pearle <ref> [35, 36] </ref>, Gisin [20] introduced a simple example of quantum state diffusion with real fluctuations that was generalized by Diosi [9] and Gisin [21].

Reference-contexts: The general result was first given for QSD equations in [25], following the statement of an invariance principle by Diosi [9], and the derivation for a Fokker-Planck equation in state space in <ref> [37] </ref>. In either the traditional or QSD formulation for open systems, there is always a problem as to where to put the boundary between system and environment. If the system is made too small, then important effects are neglected, and errors are made.

Reference-contexts: The complex Wiener process is normalized to dt, so the independent real and imaginary Wiener processes are each normalized to dt=2. This is the same normalization as in <ref> [26, 27, 38] </ref>, but is different from that of [25]. The distribution (4) is invariant under unitary transformations in the linear space of the d~ m . hL m i = h jL m j i is the quantum expectation of L m for state j i. <p> The complex It^o form of QSD was introduced in [25]. The detailed QSD theory and its applications are described in <ref> [25, 26, 27, 38] </ref>. Diffusion in the space of quantum states also appears in connection with the theory of continuous quantum measurements as shown, for example, in the many references in [1, 5]. Gisin and Percival [24] used QSD to describe a quantum jump experiment. <p> For that, it is only necessary to consider the expectations and variances of quantum dynamical variables, and then to picture these expectations and variances as if they represented the expectations and variances of classical quantities. The general theory of localization is treated in [25] and in <ref> [38] </ref>. The Schrodinger evolution of a system usually produces delocalization or dispersion. The interaction of the system with its environment, by contrast, produces localization. It is convenient to consider these competing processes separately before considering them together. The dispersion is well-known, since it occurs in isolated systems. <p> The opposite extreme is an open system which interacts with environment so strongly that the Schrodinger evolution can be neglected. This is a wide open system, and the theory of localization for these systems has been treated in detail in <ref> [38] </ref>. <p> In <ref> [38] </ref> that picture was confirmed and extended. A general theory was presented, lower bounds were put on rates of self-localization, and bounds were put on asymptotic states.

Reference-contexts: And it is important in quantum optics, where it produces the dissipation that destroys coherence. Quantum state diffusion with a moving basis (MQSD) is a method of representing and computing the evolution of individual open quantum systems. It has already been used by Percival et al. <ref> [39] </ref> to analyse the motion of a particle in a Penning trap. Here we provide a general theory of the method, and provide a guide as to when it should be used in preference to other methods. <p> These states are defined using the coherent state displacement operator, D (q; p) = exp h pQ qP : (11) The separation of the representation into a classical part (q; p) and a quantum part jq; p; ni is called the moving basis, or, as in <ref> [39] </ref>, the mixed representation. <p> Monte Carlo trajectory methods for open systems have been developed largely in connection with quantum optics, but they have been extended using QSD and MQSD to particles in traps <ref> [39] </ref>, while Spiller and his collaborators [46] have carried out some interesting QSD studies of quantum circuit elements with a view to applications to Josephson 12 junctions. However, the potential range of useful applications is far greater.

Gisin [23] investigated the 5 Heisenberg picture for QSD. Further examples are given in <ref> [25, 26, 27, 40] </ref>. 3 Localization and the moving basis For a quantum system in a pure state, localization refers to dynamical variables and operators like position, momentum, energy and angular momentum which have classical equivalents. It is helpful to picture the localization in classical phase space.
