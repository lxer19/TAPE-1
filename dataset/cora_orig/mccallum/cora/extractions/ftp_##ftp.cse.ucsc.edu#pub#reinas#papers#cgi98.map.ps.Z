Abstract: We present a new method for interactive visualization of distortion in map projections. The central idea is a floating ring on the spheroid (globe) that can be interactively positioned and scaled. As the ring is manipulated on the globe, the corresponding projection of the ring is distorted using the same map projection parameters. We apply this method to study areal and angular distortion. This method is particularly useful when analyzing large geographical extents (such as in global climate studies) where distortions are significant, as well as visualizations for which information is geo-referenced and perhaps scaled to the underlying map. It serves as a reminder that distortions exist in maps and provides information about the degree, location, and type of distortion.

Reference-contexts: The polyconic projection is a conical projection, but is neither conformal nor equivalent. It shows increasing angular and areal distortion from the central meridian (yellow-green line running north-south through Africa in Figure 5). It has been historically used to map regions of primarily north-south extent and limited east-west extent <ref> [11] </ref>. These projections were chosen partly because they have very different distortion characteristics, and thus together provide a clear medium to demonstrate the floating ring tool.
