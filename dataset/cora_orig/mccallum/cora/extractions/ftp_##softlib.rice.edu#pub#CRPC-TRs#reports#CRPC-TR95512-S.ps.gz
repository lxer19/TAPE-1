Abstract: Trust-region interior-point SQP algorithms for the solution of minimization problems with equality constraints and simple bounds on some of the variables are presented. These nonlinear programs arise from the discretization of many optimal control problems. The algorithms are designed to take advantage of this structure; in particular, provision is made for user-supplied linearized state equation solvers. The algorithms keep strict feasibility with respect to the bound constraints and use trust-region techniques to ensure global convergence. First-order convergence of these algorithms is proved for very mild conditions on the trial steps. The results given here include as special cases current results both for equality constraints and for simple bounds. 1. Introduction. In this paper we are interested in the solution of the following

Reference-contexts: Numerical example. A typical application that has the structure described in this paper is the control of a heating process. In this section we introduce a simplified model for the heating of a probe in a kiln discussed in <ref> [2] </ref>. The temperature y (x; t) inside the probe is governed by a nonlinear partial differential equation. The spatial domain is given by (0; 1). The boundary x = 1 is the inside of the probe and x = 0 is the boundary of the probe. <p> Here u low ; u upp 2 L 1 (0; T ) are given functions. If the partial differential equation and the integral are discretized we obtain an optimization problem of the form (1). The discretization uses finite elements and was introduced in <ref> [2] </ref> (see also [12] and [16]). The spatial domain (0; 1) is divided into N x subintervals of equidistant length, and the spatial discretization is done using piecewise linear finite elements. The time discretization is performed by partitioning the interval [0; T ] into N t equidistant subintervals.

Reference-contexts: The starting vector was (y 0 ; u 0 ) = (0; 0). For both, the decoupled and the coupled approaches, we used approximations to reduced and to full Hessians. We approximate these matrices with the limited memory BFGS representations given in <ref> [3] </ref> with a memory size of 5 pairs of vectors. The initial approximation chosen was flI nm for the reduced Hessian and flI n for the full Hessian, where fl is the regularization parameter in the objective function.

Reference-contexts: We propose two interior-point approaches. In the first one, the trust region is of the Dikin-Karmarkar type at a constraining bound, although we allow the trust radius to be greater than one. This is similar to the approaches given by Coleman and Li <ref> [4] </ref> and Dennis and Vicente [8] for minimization problems with simple bounds. The second maintains the trust region in the unscaled variables and has been suggested by Dennis and Vicente [8]. In both, the quadratic models are scaled and the step is inside the trust region and strictly inside B. <p> rf (x fl ) i (u fl ) i = a i =) W (x fl ) T rf (x fl ) i (u fl ) i = b i =) W (x fl ) T rf (x fl ) i Now we adapt the idea of Coleman and Li <ref> [4] </ref> to this context and define D (u) as TRIP SQP ALGORITHMS FOR A CLASS OF NLP PROBLEMS 5 a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are given by (D (u)) ii = &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; (b u) i <p> In other words, we would choose S k = D k , and the shape of the trust region would be ellipsoidal in the original basis. This has been suggested in <ref> [4] </ref>. This substitution of one ellipsoidal constraint for all the bound constraints was a prime motivation for interior-point methods. <p> We have proved a first-order convergence result for these algorithms that includes as special cases both the results established for equality constraints [6] and those for simple bounds <ref> [4] </ref>, [8]. We implemented the trust-region interior-point SQP algorithms and tested them on a specific optimal control problem governed by a nonlinear heat equation. The numerical results were quite satisfactory. We are investigating extensions of these algorithms to handle bounds on the state variables y.

First-order convergence theory. The first-order convergence result established in this section is obtained by using the convergence theory presented in <ref> [6] </ref> for the equality-constrained optimization problem. To do this we need some technical lemmas. First we recall that the quasi-normal component s n k is assumed to satisfy the conditions (3), (4), and (5). <p> For the proof of the first inequality see Lemma 7.3 in <ref> [6] </ref>. The proofs of (24) and (25) are given in [9, Lemma 6.3] and [6, Lemma 7.5], respectively. The following four lemmas bound the predicted decrease. Lemma 6.3. <p> For the proof of the first inequality see Lemma 7.3 in [6]. The proofs of (24) and (25) are given in [9, Lemma 6.3] and <ref> [6, Lemma 7.5] </ref>, respectively. The following four lemmas bound the predicted decrease. Lemma 6.3. <p> This is equivalent to Lemma 7.7 in <ref> [6] </ref>. The next lemma states the same result as Lemma 7.8 in [6] but with a different choice of ff. Lemma 6.5. <p> This is equivalent to Lemma 7.7 in <ref> [6] </ref>. The next lemma states the same result as Lemma 7.8 in [6] but with a different choice of ff. Lemma 6.5. Let (s k ) u satisfy either (10) or (11) and suppose that k D k W T k rq k (s n kC k k &gt; * tol . <p> The predicted decrease satisfies pred (s k ; k ) k for all k. Proof. The assertion follows directly from the scheme that updates k in Step 2.4 of Algorithms 5.1. Now we use the theory given by Dennis, El-Alem and Maciel <ref> [6] </ref> to state the following result. Theorem 6.1. The sequences of iterates generated by the trust-region interior point SQP Algorithms 5.1 satisfy lim inf k D k W T k )k + kC k k = 0: Proof. <p> Theorem 6.1. The sequences of iterates generated by the trust-region interior point SQP Algorithms 5.1 satisfy lim inf k D k W T k )k + kC k k = 0: Proof. Lemmas 7.9-7.13 and 8.2 as well as Theorems 8.1, 8.3 and 8.4 in <ref> [6] </ref> can be applied based on (4), (14), (15), (16), (23), (24), (25), (30), (31) and on the fact that if k D k W T k )k + kC k k &gt; * tol and kC k k ffffi k , then the penalty parameter at the current iteration does <p> Thus this result is just a restating of Theorem 8.4 of <ref> [6] </ref>. Now let D k = D (u k ), where D (u) is given by (2). <p> These algorithms use the structure of the problem, and they combine trust-region techniques for equality-constrained optimization with a affine-scaling interior-point approach for simple bounds. We have proved a first-order convergence result for these algorithms that includes as special cases both the results established for equality constraints <ref> [6] </ref> and those for simple bounds [4], [8].
