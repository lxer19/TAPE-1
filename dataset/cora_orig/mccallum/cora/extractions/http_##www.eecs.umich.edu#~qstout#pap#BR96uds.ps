Abstract: We present a method for approaching general domination and covering questions, tailored for cross-product graphs, and demonstrate it for questions concerning the existence of perfect dominating sets. Here, the definition of cross-product graphs can include families of cube-connected cycles, cube-connected cubes as well as families of hypercubes, tori, etc. We introduce a condition, unique domination, which is closely related to many other domination properties. This condition survives many variations in the notion of domination and can be explicitly determined for any arbitrary finite graph. Considering the regularities which exist in many families of cross-product graphs, the existence of this condition can often be demonstrated for all the members with only simple methods. Our approach to questions of domination relies on combining proofs of the unique domination condition with other tools. Adding only a simple graph projection technique, we demonstrate short proofs of necessary conditions for the existence of perfect dominating sets in selected examples of cross-product graphs.

Reference-contexts: Proof: From Proposition 5.7, the matrix M G;f is meta-circulant. The first row of this matrix has exactly five nonzero entries, each equal to one. From Corollary 5.6, the relevant function P r will be the sum of five not-necessarily-distinct roots of unity. From <ref> [5] </ref>, there are exactly two ways in which five nth roots of unity can sum to zero: First, the five roots are evenly spaced on the unit circle, implying n is divisible by five. <p> If 7 does not divide n, 10 does not divide n, and 12 does not divide n, then G has the unique domination property. Proof: The proof is similar to that of Proposition 5.14, again we consider the possible combinations of the nth roots of unity which by <ref> [5] </ref> must be evenly spaced in order to sum to zero. 2 Now, as corollaries, with the most basic notion of domination (that given in Definition 2.1, we obtain: Corollary 5.16 Let T be the two-dimensional torus on n vertices. <p> Corollary 5.17 Let T be the three-dimensional torus on n vertices. If 5 does not divide n, 10 does not divide n, and 12 does not divide n, then T has the unique domination property. Remark 5.18 From <ref> [5] </ref>, there are suggestions that continuing to look at conditions such as "each vertex dominates exactly k vertices" for increasing k will result in weaker and weaker conditions. Moreover, examining the conditions closely in Corollaries 5.17 and 5.17, it is not a simple matter to strengthen them.

Reference-contexts: Generalizations of the graph cross-product operation are numerous and ever-increasing. Yet, since regularities do exist in these structures, the possibility exists for parameterized solutions to the multitude of perfect domination questions. For example, in <ref> [6] </ref>, the existence of perfect dominating sets, generalized to domination with distance d, is completely answered for the family of cube-connected cycles. Regrettably, this and many of the other known results in this area are deeply limited by specifics of the problem (s) under consideration. <p> Regrettably, this and many of the other known results in this area are deeply limited by specifics of the problem (s) under consideration. In fact, it is difficult to separate many of the techniques in <ref> [6] </ref> for reuse with different families of graphs. Our intent in this paper is to provide a technique for demonstrating the nonexistence of perfect dominating sets on families of graphs, applicable to general dominating functions. One of the two main tools we will use is graph projection.
