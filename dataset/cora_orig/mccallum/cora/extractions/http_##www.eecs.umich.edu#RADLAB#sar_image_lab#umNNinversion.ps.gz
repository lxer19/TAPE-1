Abstract: Because of their recent success in other inversion tasks (Ishimaru 1990) application of an artificial neural network to the development of an inversion algorithm for radar scattering from vegetation canopies is considered. Because canopy scattering models are complicated functions of the desired biophysical parameters (vegetation biomass, leaf area index, soil moisture content, etc.), the development of an effective inversion algorithm is not a straightforward task. The Michigan Microwave Canopy Scattering (MIMICS) (Ulaby, et al. 1990) model, which has shown remarkable success in predicting the radar response to vegetation canopies, is used, as are measured polarimetric backscatter values. Hence, the radiative transfer simulation code, MIMICS, was used to produce some of the training data. The inputs to the neural network are the expected polarimetric backscatter values from specific canopies, while the outputs are the desired parameters, such as tree height, crown thickness, leaf density, etc.

Reference-contexts: In the past few years, artificial neural networks have been applied to several types of remote sensing problems (eg. Ishimaru 1990, Chuah 1993). Neural networks offer two major advances over other inversion approaches, such as the statistical and optimization methods <ref> (see Benediktsson, et al. 1990) </ref>. The first is the massive parallelism used in neural networks, and the second advantage is that the algorithms for the neural network are very general, allowing it to be used as a black box for any desired model or sets of input-output data.

Reference-contexts: These optimization techniques require calculation of the direct problem many times before converging on the solution. In the case of vegetation scattering models, this is computationally very inefficient. In the past few years, artificial neural networks have been applied to several types of remote sensing problems <ref> (eg. Ishimaru 1990, Chuah 1993) </ref>. Neural networks offer two major advances over other inversion approaches, such as the statistical and optimization methods (see Benediktsson, et al. 1990).

Reference-contexts: For the Aspen stands, the program MIMICS was used to generate the training data given the ground truth data, while the data as measured by the JPL AirSAR was used for the Loblolly stands. A widely-available neural network software package <ref> (McClelland and Rumelhart 1988) </ref> was chosen to implement the inversion algorithm. 2.1 Modeling Aspens with MIMICS The generation of the appropriate test data started with ground truth measurements of two Aspen stands for which polarimetric measurements had simultaneously been collected. These two Aspen stands were chosen for three reasons: 1. <p> The architecture of the network is largely governed by the constraints of the backpropagation algorithm <ref> (McClelland and Rumelhart 1988) </ref>. This allows for several layers of several neurons, with each layer connecting fully to the adjacent layers, and no other layers, with different multiplication factors (or weights, w k ) connecting each pair of nodes.
