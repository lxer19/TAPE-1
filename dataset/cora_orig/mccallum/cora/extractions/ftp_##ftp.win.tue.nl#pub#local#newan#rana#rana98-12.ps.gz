Reference-contexts: Combining formula (14) and (15) it is easily verified whether a Bohl function belongs to the kernel of an operator p 2 R (see also <ref> [BC, p. 55] </ref> and [HVL, p. 18] for similar results): 13 Proposition 5.3 Let p 2 R, and let for 2 C and ` 2 N, e ;` denote the Bohl function e ;` (t) = t `1 e t .

Reference-contexts: If the quotient F (s) is an entire function, it can be written in the form F = Q with H an exponential polynomial of the same form as F and G, and Q 2 R [s], i.e. Q is an ordinary polynomial in the variable s. In <ref> [BD] </ref> a generalized version of Theorem 5.8 is proved, which is also valid for exponential polynomials in several variables, and for complex exponents ae i and j .

A simplified version of this proof, based on the same ideas used in [BD], but adapted to the case considered here, is given in Appendix A. Next we combine Theorem 5.4 and Theorem 5.8. <p> Also the characterization of the ring R M in other applications remains an open problem. Appendix A This appendix is devoted to the proof of Theorem 5.8. The statement of this result is valid in a far more general context, and was proved in full generality in <ref> [BD] </ref>. We here confine ourselves to the restricted version, needed in Section 5. Our proof is based on the same ideas as in [BD], but for this simplified version the technicalities are less involved. <p> The statement of this result is valid in a far more general context, and was proved in full generality in <ref> [BD] </ref>. We here confine ourselves to the restricted version, needed in Section 5. Our proof is based on the same ideas as in [BD], but for this simplified version the technicalities are less involved. It consists of a constructive iteration, in combination with a stopping criterion, that guarantees that the number of iterations necessary to obtain the final result is finite. We start with the elaboration of the stopping criterion.

Reference-contexts: The proof of Theorem A.1 is based on the following fact on subharmonic functions (see e.g. <ref> [BG, Corollary 4.4.33] </ref>): Lemma A.2 There is no subharmonic function which is bounded above in C , except for the constants. <p> Furthermore, the limes superior u of u t (t ! 1) is continuous on C , and therefore Hartogs's Lemma (see e.g. <ref> [BG, Proposition 4.4.40] </ref>) implies that also u is a subharmonic function. To prove the theorem, assume that ae 1 ae n &lt; 1 m .

Reference-contexts: For example, delay-differential systems with incommensurable time-delays fit into this framework. This generalization from the rings R [s] and R [s; s 1 ] to arbitrary integral domains resembles in a way the extension of the theory of state space systems over fields to the ring case (see e.g. <ref> [BBV] </ref>, [S3]). However, there is an important difference. In the theory of state-space systems over rings, the system defining equations are studied in a rather formal way, without fixing explicitly the context in which these equations should be interpreted.

Reference-contexts: Then the Elimination Theorem (see <ref> [CLS, p. 114] </ref>) implies that I 0 contains a polynomial in R [s] if and only if G does. In our example G " R [s] = ?, and thus I 0 " R [s] = ?.

Reference-contexts: It is clear that ~ R is a subring of H (C ). Additionally the elements of ~ R satisfy several growth conditions; they belong to a (non-classical) Paley-Wiener algebra of holomorphic functions (see e.g. [S2, pp. 862|863], <ref> [E1] </ref>, [K2, p. 16]): Definition 5.1 The Paley-Wiener algebra PW (C ) consists of all functions f 2 H (C ) for which there exist C; a &gt; 0 and N 2 N [ f0g, depending on f , such that for all s 2 C : jf (s)j C (1 <p> Obviously, ~ R is a subring of the Paley-Wiener algebra PW (C ). Remark 5.2 In the literature (see e.g. [S2], <ref> [E1] </ref>, [K2]) the Paley-Wiener algebra is usually defined by taking Fourier instead of Laplace transforms. Hence the variable s in (13) is replaced by i!, with ! 2 C . Definition 5.1 is transformed to this classical setup by rotation of the complex plane over 2 radians.

Reference-contexts: For this particular case we derive an alternative characterization of the ring R M , that enables us to verify the equivalence of different AR-representations.

Moreover, it is clarified why in the behavioral framework systems with incommensurable time-delays are more difficult to treat than systems with commensurable delays. Nevertheless, the approach in <ref> [G-L] </ref> remains interesting in its own right, because the Bezout ring property helps to solve several other system theoretic problems, for example the question of controllability of differential-difference systems with commensurable delays in a behavioral setting. <p> In the particular application at hand, this nontrivial question was studied by Ehrenpreis in [E2].

Moreover, for this particular application, the elements of the ring R M can be characterized explicitly. <p> For differential-difference systems with commensurable delays, i.e. the case k = 1, the ring H has recently been introduced in <ref> [G-L] </ref>. Using this ring, the problem of system equivalence was solved in a different way. In [G-L] it is shown that for k = 1 (commensurable delays) the ring H is a Bezout ring, i.e. every finitely generated ideal of H is principal. <p> For differential-difference systems with commensurable delays, i.e. the case k = 1, the ring H has recently been introduced in <ref> [G-L] </ref>.

In [G-L] it is shown that for k = 1 (commensurable delays) the ring H is a Bezout ring, i.e. every finitely generated ideal of H is principal. <p> However, if the ideal I 0 does not contain a univariate polynomial in s, one may verify that also I " R [s] = ?. This contradicts formula (21) and we conclude that H is not a Bezout ring. In comparison with <ref> [G-L] </ref> the results of the present paper are more general, because they also include the situation of delay-differential systems with incommensurable delays. For these systems the ring R M = H is not a Bezout ring, and the method to solve the problem of system equivalence developed in [G-L] fails. <p> comparison with <ref> [G-L] </ref> the results of the present paper are more general, because they also include the situation of delay-differential systems with incommensurable delays.

Reference-contexts: Every zero of ~ h = ~ h 1 is a common zero of ~ f and ~g. Therefore ~ h has no zeros in C , and thus (see e.g. <ref> [H2, p. 6] </ref>) ~ h is an exponential function. So h is the quotient of two monomials in z 1 and z 2 , and we conclude that h is a unit of the ring H.
