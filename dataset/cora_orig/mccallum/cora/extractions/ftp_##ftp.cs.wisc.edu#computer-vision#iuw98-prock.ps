Abstract: Techniques for constructing three-dimensional scene models from two-dimensional images are often slow and unsuitable for interactive, real-time applications. In this paper we explore three methods of enhancing the performance of the voxel coloring reconstruction method. The first approach uses texture mapping to leverage hardware acceleration. The second approach uses spatial coherence and a coarse-to-fine strategy to focus computation on the filled parts of scene space. Finally, the multi-resolution method is extended over time to enhance performance for dynamic scenes.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Construction of 3D scene information from sets of images has long been an active research topic in computer vision. In recent years several systems have evolved that allow 3D scene construction from video <ref> [ Kanade et al., 1997, Moezzi et al., 1997 ] </ref> . Reconstruction from video allows realistic 3D movies to be recorded and played back from arbitrary vantage points. <p> Reconstruction from video is a computationally expensive process. The virtualized reality system at CMU uses 51 cameras and a bank of VCRs to record video input. The data is processed off-line using stereo methods for reconstruction <ref> [ Kanade et al., 1997 ] </ref> . The multiple perspective interactive (MPI) video efforts at UCSD also use prerecorded video as input to their system, however with many fewer cameras [ Moezzi et al., 1997 ] .

In this paper we take a structurally simple algorithm, voxel coloring, and recast it's solution as an efficient process for creating virtual scenes from video input streams.

Reference-contexts: The variants run 2 to 40 times faster than the original algorithm allowing scenes to be generated at rates of 1-2 Hz. 1.1 Voxel Coloring Voxel coloring is a scene-space-based algorithm for creating a model of a scene based on widely distributed, calibrated views <ref> [ Seitz and Dyer, 1997 ] </ref> . As the scene space is traversed, each voxel of the space is projected into the input images and analyzed to determine whether it represents a surface or non-surface region of space. <p> The vox--els are segregated into planar slabs called layers, and processed on a layer by layer basis. This allows a map to be maintained to account for occlusions in any particular view. With this occlusion map only surfaces are reconstructed. Voxel coloring, as described in <ref> [ Seitz and Dyer, 1997 ] </ref> , takes tens of seconds to tens of minutes to reconstruct a scene depending on the spatial resolution being modeled. In this paper we describe three methods for speeding up the voxel coloring process.

Reference-contexts: The application of coarse-to-fine methods to voxel coloring allows most of the computation to concentrate on locations in the scene that contain colored voxels. A similar octree strategy was applied in <ref> [ Szeliski, 1993 ] </ref> , however that method is not suitable here. 3.1 Naive Approach The main work in voxel coloring is determining which voxels should be colored. The set of colored voxels represent an approximation of the surfaces in the scene.

Reference-contexts: For the experiments in this paper Tsai's method was used to obtain calibration information <ref> [ Tsai, 1987 ] </ref> . Preprocessing of the input can result in dramatic performance gains. Preprocessing is independent of, and can occur separately from, voxel coloring. Thus it can be implemented in hardware or pipelined with voxel coloring. Prewarping the input images greatly enhances the performance of the algorithm. <p> Thus it can be implemented in hardware or pipelined with voxel coloring. Prewarping the input images greatly enhances the performance of the algorithm. Most cameras introduce some amount of radial distortion in images. Tsai's camera calibration method models this radial distortion <ref> [ Tsai, 1987 ] </ref> . However this method is slow; by prewarping the image we can use a pinhole camera model instead of Tsai's camera model. Performance of voxel coloring is also enhanced by segmentation of the foreground from the background.
