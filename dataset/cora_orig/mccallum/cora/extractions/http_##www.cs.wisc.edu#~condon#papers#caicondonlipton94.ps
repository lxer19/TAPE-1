Reference-contexts: We show that this methodology yields a 1-round, 2-prover interactive proof system for any language in PSPACE. Our interactive proof systems have exponentially small error probability. The notion of a single-prover interactive proof system was introduced by Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff [12] and by Babai <ref> [1] </ref> and was generalized to two and more provers by Ben-Or, Goldwasser, Kilian and Wigderson [5]. In a single-prover interactive proof system, a prover interacts with a probabilistic polynomial time verifier. <p> Theorem 1.1 Every language in PSPACE has a 1-round, 2-prover interactive proof system with exponentially small error probability. Our result contrasts sharply with known results on bounded round, single-prover interactive proof systems. In the single prover case, Babai <ref> [1] </ref> and Goldwasser and Sipser [13] showed that any bounded round interactive proof system can be simulated by a 2-round interactive proof system. Thus the hierarchy of language classes defined by bounded round interactive proof systems collapses and is contained in the second level of the polynomial time hierarchy. <p> Shamir [17] generalized their proof to show that all languages in PSPACE have interactive proof systems. In contrast, the bounded round IPS hierarchy collapses, and is contained in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. This follows from results of Babai <ref> [1] </ref> and Goldwasser and Sipser [13]. Finally, Babai, Fortnow and Lund [3] showed that there are 2-prover interactive proof systems for any language in nondeterministic exponential time, that is, 2IP = NEXP.

Reference-contexts: Recent breakthroughs have settled many questions on the power of interactive proof systems, culminating in the results of Lund, Fortnow, Karloff and Nisan [16] and Shamir [17] that any language in PSPACE has a single-prover interactive proof system, and Babai, Fortnow and Lund <ref> [3] </ref> that any language in nondeterministic exponential time has a two-prover interactive proof system. However until recently, the power of bounded round, 2-prover interactive proof systems remained a major open problem. <p> In contrast, the bounded round IPS hierarchy collapses, and is contained in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. This follows from results of Babai [1] and Goldwasser and Sipser [13]. Finally, Babai, Fortnow and Lund <ref> [3] </ref> showed that there are 2-prover interactive proof systems for any language in nondeterministic exponential time, that is, 2IP = NEXP. Related work of Feige [9] shows that any language in nondeterministic exponential time has a 1-round 2IPS, with error probability &lt; 1=2.

Reference-contexts: Thus they showed that any language in PH is in IP. Their proof uses a result of Lipton [15] that the permanent of square matrices over a finite field is random self-reducible. Lipton's proof is based on Beaver and Feigenbaum's <ref> [4] </ref> construction of "instance hiding schemes" for arbitrary Boolean functions. Shamir [17] generalized their proof to show that all languages in PSPACE have interactive proof systems. In contrast, the bounded round IPS hierarchy collapses, and is contained in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy.

In a single-prover interactive proof system, a prover interacts with a probabilistic polynomial time verifier. Informally, the prover and the verifier share an input x, and the prover tries to convince the verifier that x is in some language.

Reference-contexts: It was first proposed by Fortnow, Rompel and Sipser [11]. However, Fortnow [8] later observed that the polynomially many copies of the protocol are not independent, which complicates the analysis. Thus the proof in [11] is incorrect. In <ref> [6] </ref> and later in [7], the present authors studied the problem of parallelizing 2-prover interactive proof systems. <p> The following question is still open, however. If a 2IPS accepts an input w with probability p, what is the probability that the d-product of the 2IPS accepts w? In <ref> [6] </ref>, Cai, Condon and Lipton provide bounds on this probability for restricted types of 2IPS's, showing for example that as d ! 1, the probability that the d-product 2IPS accepts w ! 0.

Reference-contexts: In a 2-prover interactive proof system, two provers interact with the verifier, but the provers cannot communicate with each other during the proof.

There has recently been much progress in understanding the power of interactive proof systems. Lund, Fortnow, Karloff and Nisan <ref> [16] </ref> found an interactive proof system for the permanent function, which is hard for #P by a result of Valiant [19] and thus hard for the polynomial time hierarchy, PH, by a result of Toda [18]. Thus they showed that any language in PH is in IP. <p> We first present some useful background and notation, based on the work of Lund et al. <ref> [16] </ref> and Shamir [17]. A QBF Q can be transformed in polynomial time to a closed arithmetic form A so that Q is true if and only if A 6= 0.

The QBF problem is to determine whether a given QBF is true.
