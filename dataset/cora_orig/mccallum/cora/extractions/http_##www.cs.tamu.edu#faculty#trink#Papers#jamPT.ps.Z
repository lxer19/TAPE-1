Abstract: Consider a system of bodies with multiple concurrent contacts. The multi-rigid-body contact problem is to predict the accelerations of the bodies and the normal and friction loads acting at the contacts. This paper presents theoretical results for the multi-rigid-body contact problem under the assumptions that one or more contacts occur over locally planar, finite regions and friction forces are consistent with the maximum work inequality. We present an existence and uniqueness result for this problem under some mild assumptions on the system inputs. The application of our results to three examples is discussed.

Reference-contexts: Then the Newton-Euler equations, the kinematic equations and inequalities (arising from the bilateral and unilateral constraints, respectively), and a friction model for the contacts are used to formulate a governing system of differential-algebraic equations <ref> [4] </ref>. We note however, that formulation as a system of equations requires prior knowledge of the impending contact state (i.e., rolling, sliding, or breaking at each contact). Once formulated, the equations will have a unique solution if the system Jacobian matrix has full row rank.

Reference-contexts: In this situation, one would have to resort to other means to "guess" the impending contact state. For example, one could test all possible new contact states and choose one which is consistent <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. However, there are two problems with this approach. First, the number of possible contact states grows exponentially with the number of contacts, so enumeration becomes impractical quickly as the number of contacts grows. Second, it is possible that no consistent contact mode exists (with finite contact forces).

Reference-contexts: If there are "too many" contacts, the contact forces cannot be uniquely determined with a rigid body model. One way to resolve this indeterminacy is to incorporate a model of contact compliance <ref> [14] </ref>. However, we warn the reader that this "remedy" suffers from its own set of problems. For example, the original differential-algebraic system becomes a system of stiff differential equations whose solution then depends on the contact stiffnesses, which in turn, depend on the global geometries of the parts in contact.
