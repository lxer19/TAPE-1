Abstract: Packaging technologies impose various physical constraints on bisection bandwidth and channel width of a system whereas processor and interconnect technologies lead to certain throughput and latency demands on the system performance. Earlier studies in literature have either focused on only flat interconnections or proposed hierarchical/clustered interconnections with limited packaging constraints. Pinout technologies and capacity of packaging modules have been ignored, often leading to configurations which are not design-feasible. In this paper, we propose a new supply-demand framework for multiprocessor system design by considering packaging, processor, and interconnect technologies in an integrated manner. The elegance of this framework lies in its parameterized representation of different technologies. For a given set of technological parameters the framework derives the best configuration while considering practical design aspects like maximum board area, maximum available pinout, fixed channel width, and scalability. In order to build a scalable parallel system with a given number of processors, the framework explores the design space of flat k-ary n-cube topologies and their clustered variations (k-ary n-cube cluster-c) to derive design-feasible configurations with best system performance. The study identifies processor board area, supported channel width, board pinout density, and router pinout as critical parameters and analyzes their impact on deriving design-feasible and best configurations. For a wide range of parameters, it is shown that best configurations are achieved with cluster-based systems with 2-8 processors per cluster and 3D-5D inter-cluster interconnection.

Large parallel machines, on the other hand, typically employ several levels of packaging. There are inherent technological constraints that limit factors like VLSI die sizes, chip pinout, board areas, board pinout, and number of boards per card-cage. multiprocessor system. <p> Large system size and multiple levels of packaging have significant impact on the length of connecting wires in the system. The length of wires to connect channels depends on the distance between the connecting boards. Longer wires have higher capacitance <ref> [2] </ref> leading to elongation of the channel cycle time. However, it has been shown [25] that this problem can be alleviated by applying pipelining techniques over long wires. Such techniques are being commonly employed in recently developed systems like the Intel Paragon [14]. <p> The available number of pins from a router restricts the number of channels and channel widths that can be supported <ref> [2] </ref>. In a multi-dimensional system a router chip has to support at least two channels along any dimension, one for an incoming and another for an outgoing channel. For a system with bidirectional channels this number is four per dimension. <p> This model considers network contention and determines latency and throughput parameters for a given traffic load. Our model is a simple extension of the model proposed by Agrawal <ref> [2] </ref> to predict performance in flat k-ary n-cube networks with dimension-order [9] virtual cut-through routing. As shown in [2] the average message latency in the presence of contention through a k-ary n-cube network can be derived as: T c = 1 + (1 mF d) d 1 + n nd + <p> This model considers network contention and determines latency and throughput parameters for a given traffic load.

As shown in [2] the average message latency in the presence of contention through a k-ary n-cube network can be derived as: T c = 1 + (1 mF d) d 1 + n nd + F; (11) where T c denotes the average message latency expressed in network cycles. <p> Assuming a clustered system offering small intra-cluster latencies, the average latency seen by a message, T c , is dominated by the average inter-cluster latency. To estimate this factor we modify the model in <ref> [2] </ref> in the following manner. Given the message injection rate from each processor to be m messages/cycle, the combined traffic generated by all the processors in a cluster is mc messages/cycle. Under uniform traffic assumption, most of this traffic is inter-cluster. <p> These values are derived using Eqn. 13. Some of the values for very low radix systems were derived through 28 simulation experiments. This is because Agrawal's model <ref> [2] </ref>, on which our model is based, does not hold for very low radix configurations. The performance plots depicting the average message latency versus average throughput for all feasible configurations to build a N 1024 processor system are shown in Fig. 12. These were obtained through actual simulation experiments.

Reference-contexts: Besides design-feasibility, processor and application characteristics also lead to an expected minimal demand on performance from the system in terms of sustained average throughput and maximum allowable message latency. Sustaining a desired performance places a demand on the latency-throughput characteristics of a system configuration <ref> [4, 22] </ref>. Thus, an architect should identify such demand on performance and use it as a criterion to select good configurations satisfying the demand. However, the demanded performance is not a fixed parameter. It is a function of processor and interconnection speeds. <p> Recently, we have introduced a new k-ary n-cube cluster-c organization <ref> [4, 5, 19] </ref> to capture this upcoming trend in building scalable parallel systems. In this organization, the lower level consists of k n processor clusters. These clusters are interconnected by a higher level direct k-ary n-cube network (also referred to as inter-cluster network or internet).

It limits the number of bits that can cross from one half to another half of the network. Let us analyze the impact of sustaining an average throughput of bits/cycle per processor on the network bisection size in the inter-cluster network. <p> Denoting the inter-cluster bisection size as B wires, it is clear that B = N (1 c=N )=2 wires are needed to sustain the demanded traffic. However, due to contention in the network the utilization of the network channels are only a fraction of the maximum capacity <ref> [9] </ref>. To compensate for such loss in bandwidth due to contention, the actual value of B required to support a throughput of bits/cycle has to be greater than N (1 c=N )=2. <p> constraints of these levels are discussed in Section 5 and their impact on the set of feasible (or supplied) configurations derived in Section 8. 4 Packaging Model for Clustered Systems Some earlier models, proposed to capture packaging constraints, like the VLSI model with limited bisection bandwidth as proposed by Dally <ref> [9] </ref> and the limited pincount model as proposed by Agrawal [2] deal with only one level of packaging. Large parallel machines, on the other hand, typically employ several levels of packaging. <p> However, under surface pinout technology, for any fixed inter-cluster dimensionality it leads to a rise in channel width. 17 6.2 Supporting a Fixed Inter-Cluster Channel Width Most of the prior studies on system design, while proposing guidelines under different constraints like constant bisection bandwidth <ref> [9] </ref>, did not impose any restrictions on the values that the channel width can take while satisfying other constraints. As discussed in Section 5.3 supporting an arbitrarily large channel width is not easy. <p> As discussed earlier in Section 3.1 the bisection size of the inter-cluster network B, or more specifically bisection size per processor B=N , is indicative of the supportable average throughput per processor in the system <ref> [9] </ref>. Observations derived in this subsection for the bisection size per processor reflect similar trends on system throughput. These observations are expected to be broad guidelines to aid the design decision process. A more accurate modeling of the average throughput in presence of contention is presented in the next section. <p> This model considers network contention and determines latency and throughput parameters for a given traffic load. Our model is a simple extension of the model proposed by Agrawal [2] to predict performance in flat k-ary n-cube networks with dimension-order <ref> [9] </ref> virtual cut-through routing.

Examples of previous work in this area include two-level systems based on hypercube and other network topologies [10, 18, 22], MINs and n-hop networks [22], and combination of bus and mesh/hypercube networks [12]. Though these designs provide alternative ways to build parallel systems, most of them do not take any packaging constraints into account. Thus, it is difficult to use these configurations to build realistic systems under varying technological and packaging constraints. <p> Besides design-feasibility, processor and application characteristics also lead to an expected minimal demand on performance from the system in terms of sustained average throughput and maximum allowable message latency. Sustaining a desired performance places a demand on the latency-throughput characteristics of a system configuration <ref> [4, 22] </ref>. Thus, an architect should identify such demand on performance and use it as a criterion to select good configurations satisfying the demand. However, the demanded performance is not a fixed parameter. It is a function of processor and interconnection speeds. <p> It is easy to observe that the flat k-ary n-cube systems can be derived as a special case of the k-ary n-cube cluster-c family by choosing cluster size c = 1. Since inter-cluster interconnections are more expensive than intra-cluster interconnections <ref> [22] </ref>, in this paper we primarily emphasize on internet and cluster size. In the following sections, we develop a supply-demand optimization framework to derive optimal k-ary n-cube cluster-c organizations (c 1). Table 1 provides a summary of the main symbols and notations used in this paper. <p> Thus, to support larger sized clusters, the intra-cluster bisection size should scale linearly with size c. Since packaging constraints are less rigid in lower hierarchies, it is possible to provide thicker channels/buses to achieve higher bandwidth inside a cluster <ref> [22] </ref>. Hence in this paper, we focus only on the bisection size of the inter-cluster network. 8 3.2 Demanded Bound on Average Network Latency The achievable average message latency can have a direct impact on the processor efficiency in a multiprocessor system.

Reference-contexts: An increase in processing power leads to a higher value of D. As a general observation in applications, an amount of computation is associated with a quota of necessary communication, expressed as the computation to communication ratio (r Flops/bit) <ref> [23] </ref>. Therefore while computing at the rate D MFlops/sec a processor demands a sustained communication rate or average throughput of (D=r) Mbits/sec. To allow such a demanded traffic rate the underlying interconnection network should be able to sustain a minimum of (D=r) Mbits/sec per processor. <p> To allow such a demanded traffic rate the underlying interconnection network should be able to sustain a minimum of (D=r) Mbits/sec per processor. A typical estimate of the range of computation to communication ratio, as suggested in <ref> [23] </ref>, is r = 0:125 to 1:25 Flops/bit. For an example system with D = 100MFlops/sec and r = 0:50 Flops/bit the expected throughput demand on the network is (100/0.50)Mbits/sec or 200 fi 10 6 bits/sec per processor. <p> For a lower value of r the corresponding values in the range of would be higher. 7 Table 2: Sample values of for various representative combinations of processor and network speeds. A computation to communication ratio of r = 0:5 Flops/bit <ref> [23] </ref> is assumed.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Rapid developments in the field of processor, interconnect, and, packaging technologies make the task of efficient design of large multiprocessor systems a difficult one <ref> [7, 10, 12, 15, 25] </ref>. Design guidelines need to take into account technological changes to yield system configurations delivering best performance. Several previous studies have considered packaging constraints [3] while selecting the best system configuration. <p> The length of wires to connect channels depends on the distance between the connecting boards. Longer wires have higher capacitance [2] leading to elongation of the channel cycle time. However, it has been shown <ref> [25] </ref> that this problem can be alleviated by applying pipelining techniques over long wires. Such techniques are being commonly employed in recently developed systems like the Intel Paragon [14].
