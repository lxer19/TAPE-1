Abstract: A conjecture of Toft [16] asserts that any 4-critical graph (or equivalently, every 4-chromatic graph) contains a fully odd subdivision of K 4 . It is shown that if a graph G has a degree three node v such that Gv is 3-colourable, then either G is 3-colourable or it contains a fully odd K 4 . This resolves Toft's conjecture in the special case where a 4-critical graph has a degree three node, which is in turn used to prove the conjecture for line-graphs. The proof is constructive and yields a polynomial algorithm which given a 3-degenerate graph either finds a 3-colouring or exhibits a subgraph that is a fully odd subdivision of K 4 . A graph is 3-degenerate if every subgraph has some node of degree at most three. A subdivision H of K n is any graph obtained by replacing some edges uv by a uv path (whose internal nodes are then of degree two in H ). The subdivision is called fully odd if each of the added paths has an odd number of edges. An odd K n is a subdivision where each of the triangles becomes an odd cycle, thus each fully odd K n is an odd K n but not conversely. Hajos had conjectured that if a graph contains no subgraph which is the subdivision of a K n , then it can be (n 1)-coloured. This was proved for n 4 by Dirac [3], disproved for n 7 by Catlin [1] and remains open for n = 5; 6. In fact, as a stronger version of Dirac's result Toft [16] has conjectured that if a graph has no subgraph which is a fully odd K 4 , then it is 3-colourable. An intermediate result due to Catlin states that if a graph has no odd K 4 as a subgraph, then it is 3-colourable. The class of graphs with no odd K 4 has been further studied in [8] where a recognition algorithm is given which is based on a decomposition theorem. This is used in [9] to show that these graphs are t-perfect. This stronger property does not hold for graphs with no
