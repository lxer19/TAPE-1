Abstract: The MBone was created to study multicast protocol performance and global conferencing. Part of this evaluation includes studying the behavior of those who use the MBone for conferencing. We have developed a tool to collect start and end time data for MBone sessions. Using analysis tools and collected data, we have produced a characterization of MBone usage including: (1) daily usage patterns including connection inter-arrival time and duration, (2) number of hops needed to reach the set of destinations, and (3) geographical location of group members. Using data for all sessions we have refined our model of MBone usage by developing a model of how users move among active sessions.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The MBone <ref> [1] </ref> is an experimental network that overlays the Internet. Through the use of "tunnels" and native multicasting, the MBone forms a global multicast-capable network [2]. One well-established use of this network is for the development and testing of global conferencing tools capable of supporting hundreds of participants.

Reference-contexts: Information about sessions is provided by frequently transmitting announcements on a well known multicast address and port. The Session Directory (SD) tool <ref> [3] </ref> listens to this address and creates a list of sessions and related information for each. When a session is selected, SD will launch all the tools necessary to receive all the component streams of a session.

The Mlisten tool has a graphical interface which gives a real-time report of MBone activity 1 . In addition to the visual information, more detailed data is written to log files.
