Abstract: This paper considers the support of real-time applications to mobile hosts in an Integrated Services Packet Network. We have proposed a service model for mobile hosts that can support adaptive applications which can withstand wide range of available bandwidth, as well as applications which require mobility independent service guarantees. We describe an admission control scheme and a reservation protocol for implementing this service model. Our admission control scheme achieves high utilization of network resources.

Reference-contexts: But when M 1 moves into C 2 , M 2 must release the resources reserved for M 1 at C 2 . 3 Related works and our approach Recently there has been some work addressing the problem of providing QoS to mobile hosts. In <ref> [1] </ref> an architecture for a high-speed mobile ATM network using a new concept known as the virtual connection tree is proposed and an analytical method of admission control for mobile hosts is described.

Reference-contexts: Clark et al.<ref> [4] </ref> have described an architecture for an ISPN that supports real-time traffic. In this architecture they have described a service model for real-time traffic with two service classes, guaranteed and predictive. Jamin et al.[6] have described a scheme to implement the service model described in [4]. As portable computers become more powerful and the accessibility of a fixed network from a mobile host becomes easier, the number of mobile users will grow and additionally the mobile users will demand the same real-time services available to fixed hosts. <p> In this paper, we investigate the problems of providing real-time services to mobile hosts in an ISPN. As described in <ref> [4] </ref>, to handle real-time services an enhanced architecture is required for a network. This architecture has five key components. The first component is the nature of service commitments the network can provide. <p> To provide real-time services, this congestion delay must be bounded or minimized. In <ref> [4] </ref>, real-time applications have been classified into two classes, tolerant applications which can adapt to packet delays and thus can tolerate occasional delay bound violations, and intolerant applications which cannot tolerate any delay bound violations. <p> In the rest of this section we describe the service models for the mobile multimedia applications and the scheduling algorithms used for these service models. 4.1 Service Models The service models, we propose, are derived from the two service models, guaranteed and predictive services, described in <ref> [4] </ref> by Clark et al. We define three service classes to which mobile users may subscribe. These are: 1. <p> The MIG flows belong to the guaranteed service class; the MIP and MDP flows belong to the predictive class. There are multiple levels of predictive service with widely separated delay bounds. The scheduling algorithm considers only the active flows at a switch. The unified scheduling algorithm of <ref> [4] </ref> is used, i.e., guaranteed service is provided by the Weighted Fair Queuing scheduling discipline described in [10, 5] and the predictive service is provided by the priority queuing algorithm using the bandwidth leftover from serving guaranteed service.

Reference-contexts: A flow is admitted to the network only if it passes the admission control criteria at each switch or base station where the flow requires reservation. Our admission control algorithm is derived from the measurement-based admission control scheme for ISPN proposed by Jamin et al. in <ref> [6] </ref>. In Reference [6], Jamin et al. have described a technique to measure the queuing delays, usage rates of the guaranteed service class and each predictive class. <p> A flow is admitted to the network only if it passes the admission control criteria at each switch or base station where the flow requires reservation.

In addition, we augment the measurement process of <ref> [6] </ref> to measure the parameter, token generation rate of the equivalent token bucket filter for each individual active flow.
