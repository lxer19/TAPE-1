Reference-contexts: Thus, the minimum number of consumption channels required for a system with virtual lane support remains the same as that of its underlying deadlock-free routing R, as indicated in Theorem 3. However, more consumption channels may be used to reduce blocking and obtain better performance <ref> [1] </ref>. For adaptive routing schemes with cyclic dependencies, such as the one proposed by Duato [13], the BRCP model allows paths conforming to the associated acyclic routing sub-function, 12 as discussed earlier.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, wormhole-routed systems have supported only point-to-point (unicast) message passing mechanism. This mechanism allows a message to have exactly one destination, which leads to collective communication operations being implemented as multiple phases of unicast message exchange <ref> [4, 22] </ref>. Each of these phases incurs a communication start-up cost, which is quite high on 1 This research is supported in part by NSF Grant MIP-9309627 and NSF Career Award MIP-9502294.

Reference-contexts: It is to be noted that a similar but restricted method of using only column-path has also been independently proposed recently by Boppana, Chalasani, and Raghavendra <ref> [5] </ref>. routing schemes in a 2-D mesh. In addition to ecube paths, added flexibility for new paths under planar and west first routing schemes are shown in bold lines. The BRCP model can be extended to higher dimensional e-cube systems. <p> This leads to added dependency and three consumption channels may not be sufficient as shown in Figure 4c. In such cases at least four consumption channels per node are needed. Similar solutions have also been proposed in <ref> [5] </ref> to provide two consumption channels per node for deadlock freedom in column-path routing. Since the BRCP model provides more flexibility more consumption channels are required. The above results, derived for 2D mesh supporting e-cube routing, can be easily extended to k-ary n-cube topology and other routing schemes. <p> Application of this model to other collective communication operations like synchronization and global reduction can be found in [25, 26]. 4 Broadcasting To demonstrate the potential of the BRCP model, we consider two commonly used collective communication operations: one-to-all broadcasting [2, 3, 7, 18, 17] and one-to-many multicasting <ref> [5, 15, 22] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The wormhole-routing switching technique is becoming the trend in building future parallel systems due to its inherent advantages like low-latency communication and reduced communication hardware overhead <ref> [12, 24] </ref>. Intel Paragon, Cray T3D, Ncube, J-Machine, and Stanford DASH are representative systems falling into this category. Such systems are being used for supporting either distributed-memory, shared-memory, or distributed-shared memory programming paradigms. <p> Also, the Hamiltonian path-based scheme assumes the existence of a hamiltonian path in the routing scheme supported by the system. Current commercial and experimental systems (Intel Paragon, Cray T3D, Ncube-3, Stanford DASH) use e-cube routing <ref> [12] </ref>. Recently, various adaptive routing schemes have been proposed in the literature [6, 10, 13, 16, 32]. It is conceivable that future systems will adopt these adaptive schemes. In fact, the recent Cray T3E uses such a scheme. <p> Depending on the routing scheme used in a network, this model allows a multidestination message to propagate through valid paths conforming to the base-routing scheme. The model is described and illustrated for a set of representative routing schemes: e-cube <ref> [12] </ref>, planar-adaptive [10], fully-adaptive [13], and turn-model [16]. Architectural support to implement multidestination message-passing on current generation networks and the associated deadlock-freedom properties are analyzed.

The basic idea is to provide a routing function R as well as a connected routing sub-function R 1 of R. The routing sub-function R 1 is chosen in such a way that there are no cycles in its extended channel dependency graph. <p> The channels under R 1 work as escape channels to provide deadlock-freedom in the presence of cycles under routing constraint R. This routing class was developed by Duato to provide fully-adaptive routing with minimal number of virtual channels <ref> [13] </ref>. Recently, many other routing schemes [14] have been added to this class. 3.2 The BRCP Model Let us consider the routing sequence of a multidestination worm. As discussed in Section 2, it carries ids of multiple destinations in its header as an ordered list. <p> This model is also applicable to both classes of routing schemes which were discussed earlier. Let us assume the network supports a deadlock-free routing scheme R for unicast message passing.

We use Definition 2 to determine valid paths for multidestination worms. Let us apply the BRCP model to a 2D mesh supporting e-cube routing. Figure 3a shows valid paths for a 2D mesh supporting e-cube routing under the BRCP model. <p> With a consistent channel selection policy (sticking with either virtual channel d i+1;0 or d i+1;1 ) such deadlock scenarios can be easily avoided for multidestination messages. Finally, let us apply the BRCP model to Duato's fully-adaptive routing scheme <ref> [13] </ref>. Let us assume that the routing sub-function R 1 used for this fully-adaptive scheme is e-cube. Under this situation, as shown in Fig. 3d, R, C, and RC are valid BRCPs. These paths are similar to those for e-cube routing, as shown in Fig. 3a. <p> However, more consumption channels may be used to reduce blocking and obtain better performance [1]. For adaptive routing schemes with cyclic dependencies, such as the one proposed by Duato <ref> [13] </ref>, the BRCP model allows paths conforming to the associated acyclic routing sub-function, 12 as discussed earlier. Therefore, the consumption channel requirement for fully-adaptive routing systems is the same as that of systems with the associated acyclic routing sub-function R 1 . <p> Therefore, the adaptivity does not help in reducing broadcast latency. In the next section we will show that D paths can in fact help in reducing latency for multicast operation. For 2D systems supporting fully-adaptive routing <ref> [13] </ref> with e-cube-routed escape channels, the supportable BRCP paths are R, C, and RC. Thus, broadcasting can be done in two steps by using the fRC,(RC/R/C)g scheme (if k 1 k 2 + 1).

Reference-contexts: Next, the BRCP model is developed and illustrated for both these classes. Finally, deadlock-freedom properties of this model are discussed. 3.1 Two classes of Routing Schemes Current wormhole-routing schemes with unicast message passing can be broadly classified into two classes <ref> [14] </ref>. The routing schemes belonging to the first class are based on routing functions which avoid cyclic dependencies between messages. Routing schemes belonging to this class are the popular e-cube routing [12], planar-adaptive routing [10], turn-model [16], etc. <p> The channels under R 1 work as escape channels to provide deadlock-freedom in the presence of cycles under routing constraint R. This routing class was developed by Duato to provide fully-adaptive routing with minimal number of virtual channels [13]. Recently, many other routing schemes <ref> [14] </ref> have been added to this class. 3.2 The BRCP Model Let us consider the routing sequence of a multidestination worm. As discussed in Section 2, it carries ids of multiple destinations in its header as an ordered list. It gets routed in a piece-wise manner. <p> Thus, 2nv consumption channels are sufficient for not introducing any additional dependency among the multidestination worms. The above result holds good for any routing and topology without virtual lane <ref> [14] </ref> support. Virtual lanes are typically used to reduce congestion and do not introduce any additional communication channel dependency. Each set of virtual lanes entering a node from a given dimension and direction can share a consumption channel.

Figure 3a shows valid paths for a 2D mesh supporting e-cube routing under the BRCP model. <p> In this system seven kinds of paths are feasible under the BRCP model: X, Y, Z, XY, YZ, XZ, and XYZ. Similar paths can also be enumerated 9 for higher dimensional e-cube routed systems. Let us consider the turn-model routing scheme <ref> [16] </ref> which is an adaptive routing scheme that does not use virtual channels. This scheme can support either minimal or non-minimal routing. routing. <p> Otherwise, a three step fU,RC,Cg scheme can be used. planar-adaptive routing, b) one-step scheme for turn model with west-first non-minimal routing, and c) two-step scheme for turn model with north-last non-minimal routing. Now let us consider the turn-model <ref> [16] </ref> with west-first non-minimal routing. As shown in Fig. 7b, one-to-all broadcasting can be implemented in just one step using a fNMWFg scheme. Here the adaptivity as well as the non-minimal property in routing help in reducing the broadcast latency. <p> Here onwards, without loss of generality, we consider only west-first non-minimal routing for 2D systems supporting turn model. For higher dimensional systems with turn model we consider the counterpart of the west-first routing: all-but-one-negative-first routing <ref> [16] </ref>. In the absence of the BRCP model, it takes dlog 2 (k 1 k 2 )e communication steps to support broadcasting in a k 1 fi k 2 mesh using unicast message passing [22].

Reference-contexts: In this section we present experimental results for single-source multicast and broadcast in the absence of background traffic. The main objective behind these experiments is to understand the complete dynamics of the BRCP model for different topological and technological parameters. Interested readers are requested to refer to <ref> [19] </ref> for a more detailed study of multiple multicasts. 6.1 Broadcasting 6.1.1 Effect of System Size and Adaptivity It also illustrates the effect of adaptivity. It can be observed that as the system size increases, both Umesh [22] and Hamiltonian-path-based schemes [20] incur more latency to implement broadcast. <p> It focuses on both architectural and algorithmic aspects. This paper introduces the BRCP model and studies its impact on implementing single-source broadcast and multicast operations. Application of this scheme for multiple multicast has been discussed in <ref> [19] </ref>. The multidestination mechanism has been extended for other types of collective communication in the following papers: barrier synchronization [25] and global reduction [26]. Multidestination-based multicast and gather operations have also been applied and evaluated for distributed shared memory systems in [11].

Reference-contexts: Therefore, it is essential to implement these operations with reduced latency. In order to reduce the number of phases to implement collective communication operations, Lin and Ni proposed a Hamiltonian Path-based scheme in <ref> [21] </ref>. This scheme uses a modified router organization to support propagation of multidestination messages (a message with multiple destinations). It allows a message to be concurrently copied into one destination node while it is being forwarded to the next destination. <p> These algorithms are developed and evaluated for 2D and 3D wormhole networks with different routing schemes. It is shown that the BRCP model reduces the latency of these operations considerably compared to Umesh [22] and Hamiltonian-path-based <ref> [21] </ref> schemes. As the number of participating destinations in a multicast increases beyond certain number, the BRCP model allows a steady reduction in the multicast latency. With increase in adaptivity in the underlying routing scheme, further reduction in multicast latency is demonstrated. <p> The injection and consumption channels are also called internal channels [24]. 4 consisting of injection and consumption channels. 2.2 Multidestination Message Passing Mechanism The concept of wormhole message passing mechanism with multiple destinations was first introduced by Lin and Ni in <ref> [21] </ref>. A single destination (unicast) message on wormhole networks typically consists of three parts: a header flit, one or more data flit (s), and a a tail flit. A multidestination message has data and tail flits similar to those of a unicast message.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, wormhole-routed systems have supported only point-to-point (unicast) message passing mechanism. This mechanism allows a message to have exactly one destination, which leads to collective communication operations being implemented as multiple phases of unicast message exchange <ref> [4, 22] </ref>. Each of these phases incurs a communication start-up cost, which is quite high on 1 This research is supported in part by NSF Grant MIP-9309627 and NSF Career Award MIP-9502294. <p> In particular, we present algorithms for two commonly used collective communication operations, broadcast and multicast. These algorithms are developed and evaluated for 2D and 3D wormhole networks with different routing schemes. It is shown that the BRCP model reduces the latency of these operations considerably compared to Umesh <ref> [22] </ref> and Hamiltonian-path-based [21] schemes.

In this section we show how the BRCP model can be used to implement broadcasting on k-ary n-cube systems with reduced latency. First, we propose efficient broadcasting algorithms for 2D e-cube systems. <p> In the absence of the BRCP model, it takes dlog 2 (k 1 k 2 )e communication steps to support broadcasting in a k 1 fi k 2 mesh using unicast message passing <ref> [22] </ref>. <p> Now the nodes in this cube can cover nodes along the fourth dimension with an additional communication step. This leads to a broadcasting scheme with (n + 1) steps. By using unicast-based approach <ref> [22] </ref>, one-to-all broadcasting in a k-ary n-mesh takes dlog 2 (k n )e steps. <p> If s is not a member in L m , we have jL s m j = jL m + 1j. Otherwise, both sets are identical. The first phase involves performing unicast-based multicast (using the Umesh algorithm <ref> [22] </ref>) on the set L s m using point-to-point (single destination) messages. This phase takes dlog 2 (jL s m j)e communication steps. If the source happens to be the sole level m leader then this phase is eliminated. <p> Since only R and C paths are available, no further grouping of leaders in L 2 is possible under either ordering. with R and C paths. After the grouping is over, the multicast takes place as follows. In the first phase, the Umesh algorithm <ref> [22] </ref> is used to cover three level 2 leaders in two communication steps. The second phase involves level 2 leaders sending multidestination worms along C paths. In the last phase, all level 1 leaders send multidestination worms along R paths. Thus, the multicast is finished in four steps. <p> Interested readers are requested to refer to [19] for a more detailed study of multiple multicasts. 6.1 Broadcasting 6.1.1 Effect of System Size and Adaptivity It also illustrates the effect of adaptivity. It can be observed that as the system size increases, both Umesh <ref> [22] </ref> and Hamiltonian-path-based schemes [20] incur more latency to implement broadcast.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The wormhole-routing switching technique is becoming the trend in building future parallel systems due to its inherent advantages like low-latency communication and reduced communication hardware overhead <ref> [12, 24] </ref>. Intel Paragon, Cray T3D, Ncube, J-Machine, and Stanford DASH are representative systems falling into this category. Such systems are being used for supporting either distributed-memory, shared-memory, or distributed-shared memory programming paradigms. <p> The most commonly used direct network topologies are meshes/tori, which belong to the class of generalized k-ary n-cube interconnections <ref> [24] </ref>. These interconnections are n-dimensional grids with k 0 ; k 1 ; ; k n1 nodes along the dimensions 0; 1; ; n1, respectively. Each node in the system comprises of a router and a processor. The routers are connected in a 3x3 configuration. <p> Each processor is connected to its router through a set of injection and consumption channels. The injection channels are used to inject messages to the network, and the consumption channels are used to consume messages from the network. The injection and consumption channels are also called internal channels <ref> [24] </ref>. 4 consisting of injection and consumption channels. 2.2 Multidestination Message Passing Mechanism The concept of wormhole message passing mechanism with multiple destinations was first introduced by Lin and Ni in [21].
