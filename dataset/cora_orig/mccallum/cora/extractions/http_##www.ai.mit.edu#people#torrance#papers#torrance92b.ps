Title: The Case for a Realistic Mobile Robot Simulator  
Author: Mark C. Torrance 
Affiliation: Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology  
Abstract: Simulators used in research on autonomous mobile robots have been criticized for their tendency to change the nature of the problems the robot control architecture has to solve. In this paper we address those arguments, and find that under certain conditions simulators can be a valuable tool to supplement research with physical robots. We conclude with guidelines for the successful design and use of simulators in research on mobile robots.

Reference-contexts: Mark Drummond and Martha Pollack have a simulator called Tileworld which, though different in some details, shares the dynamic and unpredictable characteristics of Sutton's simulator. The video game domains Pengo and Amazon used by Phil Agre and David Chapman in their work on Pengi <ref> [1] </ref> and Sonja [2] are another example of a less than realistic simulator. Agre argues that the domain shares many of the problems of situated action found in the physical world, while finessing certain hard problems such as vision.

Reference-contexts: In some cases simulators are motivated strongly by the physical characteristics of a particular robot and environment. More often, simulators idealize and abstract certain parts of the problem. The use of simulators as a substitute for experiments with physical robots has been roundly criticized <ref> [3; 4] </ref>. In this paper, we will consider these criticisms, as well as positive reasons for using simulators. We go on to discuss some existing simulators and the ways in which they have been used. <p> Despite their advantages simulators have been criticized for making it easy to solve some difficult problems, making it difficult to solve other easy problems, and for creating false decompositions of robot control problems. We shall consider these criticisms in turn. In <ref> [3] </ref>, Brooks argues that simulation "requires a constant feedback from real experiments to ensure that it is not being abused." He goes on to say that simulators create a temptation to simulate the perceptual system, creating false decompositions which lead researchers to work fl This material is based upon work supported

In <ref> [5] </ref>, Brooks adds that cellular representations of space are problematic in simulations of physical robots. We agree that real robots and environments must be used during the design of simulators which attempt to model them. <p> The user should be able to control the granularity of the simulation in both space and time. Continuous motion simulation should be used wherever possible, as unintended effects from discrete simulation have been documented <ref> [5] </ref>. Pseudorandom sequences used to generate data for simulated sensors should be repeatable exactly.

Reference-contexts: The use of these representations in such domains is fine, but some have tried to extend the use of cellular spaces to robot control problems, particularly in the field of Distributed AI (see, for example <ref> [6] </ref>). We agree with Brooks that such simulations are unlikely to model physical robots well enough to be useful research tools, and we recommend continuous space simulation. We feel that it is important to credit scientists with the responsibility to use their tools wisely. <p> The perception this research assumes is not as farfetched as a "magic recognition box," but it is well beyond the capabilities of current artificial vision systems. MICE is an experimental testbed offered by Durfee and Montgomery for distributed artificial intelligence research <ref> [6] </ref>. It contains many features which make it attractive for experiments with multiple communicating robots with het-erogenous skills. It uses multiple asynchronous processes to simulate each robot, so the simulation of multiple robots may potentially start many processes.

Reference-contexts: Rather, it suggests the character of some of what has been done with simulators in mobile robot research. Realistic Simulators The simulators described below have in common the goal of realistic simulation of particular physical mobile robots and their environment. Erann Gat <ref> [7] </ref> implemented and used a simulator for some experiments as part of his Ph.D. thesis on his AT-LANTIS architecture. In this case, the simulator modelled an existing physical robot. <p> The powerful simulator we call for here has its origins in the discussion of better simulators as a future direction Erann Gat's dissertation <ref> [7] </ref>. Our hope is that by making some features of this proposed simulator concrete, we may encourage others to join our efforts to develop such a simulator.

Reference-contexts: It is interesting, however, in that it tests the hypothesis that simulators can be designed well enough that the same robot control program runs on both the simulator and the physical robot being simulated. In my own Master's research, I plan to extend the work of Maja Mataric <ref> [9; 8] </ref> on Toto to handle higher-level linguistically described cognitive features. Toward this end, I have begun to build a simulator for the sonar-based robot Toto in its indoor office environment.

Reference-contexts: This may teach us something about what is needed for a simulator to be truly reusable and general. Lynn Stein has done some work on a program, MetaToto [11], which models to a very rough approximation the environment of the robot Toto built by Maja Mataric <ref> [9] </ref>. In her paper, Stein maintains that when coupled with a working robot system, rough simulation can help MetaToto to build an approximate landmark map which can be useful while the robot learns about a new physical topology. <p> It is interesting, however, in that it tests the hypothesis that simulators can be designed well enough that the same robot control program runs on both the simulator and the physical robot being simulated.

Reference-contexts: Gat provides a good discussion of the appropriate use of simulators, and follows his own advice and our recommendations in the clarity and quality of his reports on experiments performed with the simulator. Jonas Karlsson and Patrick Teo have implemented a simulator called Botworld <ref> [10] </ref> for Nils Nilsson at Stan-ford University to demonstrate his work on Action Networks and Teleo-Reactive Sequences. This program uses a client-server model, allowing robot control programs to be written in other languages and run on different machines.

Reference-contexts: In some cases, these simulators abstract parts of the navigation problem by assuming a cellular space. Rich Sutton's work on the DYNA learning architecture <ref> [12; 13] </ref> uses a simulation which models some aspects of a dynamically changing environment with spatial locality. As a simulator, this program suffers from the criticism that it may allow a false decomposition of the problem of intelligent action by allowing Sutton to focus on a reasoning problem in isolation.
