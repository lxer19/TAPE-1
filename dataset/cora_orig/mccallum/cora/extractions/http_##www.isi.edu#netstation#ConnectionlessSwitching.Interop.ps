Abstract: Virtual-circuit switching achieves high forwarding performance via the combination of a hardware frame forwarding path and link-layer connection state that is stored in each switch along a virtual circuit. A similar result can be achieved when forwarding datagrams across an internetwork by uncoupling forwarding from hop-by-hop routing. That uncoupling is achieved by using a specialized network-layer protocol to wrap the datagram of another network-layer protocol with a source route that is derived by consulting hop-by-hop routing tables. Periodically rederiving these source routes achieves the adaptability needed to maintain compatibility with connectionless datagram routing. This paper proposes source routing as an alternative to distributed-state switching protocols for forwarding IP traffic. 1

Reference-contexts: When source hosts use OvIP, proxy initiation by the local router/switch is not needed, since those hosts would initiate and maintain their own OvIP routing tables. 9 Prior Related Work OvIP methodology combines source routing with network-layer switching to increase forwarding performance. Cheriton made a similar proposal <ref> [1] </ref>. IP over ATM and IP Switching [2] increase forwarding performance by taking advantage of A TM virtual-circuit support in the link layer to construct a circuit that corresponds to an IP f low and subsequently, switch that flow across an ATM cloud. <p> Tag Switching [4] generalizes IP Switching to multiple link-layers. 9.1 Sirpent 4 Sirpent <ref> [1] </ref> proposed replacing connectionless f o rw a rd i n g w i th s o u rc e routed, n e t w o rk layer switching. A Sirpent source route is composed of a sequence of switch-specif ic forwarding directives. OvIP shares these characteristics with Sirpent.

Reference-contexts: Another concern is that if a f low is allowed past a firewall, that the initiator may change the destination address in the payload datagram within the OvIP datagram sent over that ow and, by so doing, obtain access to a prohibited destination. IP Switching <ref> [2] </ref> prevents this by requiring that the router at the termination of a multi-hop virtual circuit store those header fields used when a circuit was constructed and subsequently, compare them with the actual headers received over that circuit and discard nonconforming datagrams. <p> Cheriton made a similar proposal [1]. IP over ATM and IP Switching <ref> [2] </ref> increase forwarding performance by taking advantage of A TM virtual-circuit support in the link layer to construct a circuit that corresponds to an IP f low and subsequently, switch that flow across an ATM cloud.

Reference-contexts: To retain Internet compatibility, forwarding must adapt to the dynamics of network-layer routing. To achieve 2. It is possible to associate source-routed switching with the LLC, rather than the network-layer, by extending the SNAP definition <ref> [6] </ref>. That is inappropriate for some networks. this the host or router at the head of an OvIP source route, called an initiator, caches the source route, treating it as soft state [7].

Reference-contexts: That is inappropriate for some networks. this the host or router at the head of an OvIP source route, called an initiator, caches the source route, treating it as soft state <ref> [7] </ref>. A source route S ( r i , r k ) is maintained by its initiator, r i , which periodically re-derives and updates it. An OvIP source route ends at a host or router r k called the terminator.

Reference-contexts: Cases where that condition fails will then be examined. 5.1 Persistence of Typical Routes The persistence of end-to-end routes across the Internet has been the subject of a recent study by Paxson <ref> [16] </ref>, who monitored routes across 8% of the approximately 1000 ASs that made up the Internet. This showed that at least 99% of all routes were stable for ten minutes or greater. Less than a percent varied on the order of a minute or less. <p> Assuming PR i = 8 seconds, overhead falls rapidly as F (r i ,dst) rises. 6.2 Encapsulation A prototype packet format for OvIP is def ined in the length of the source route. According to <ref> [16] </ref>, the diameter of the Internet in 1996 is slightly greater than 30 hops.
