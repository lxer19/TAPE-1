Abstract: This paper describes a new control architecture for telerobotics research. The architecture described is object oriented and data driven, and can be distributed over many processors on a wide-area network. The basic capabilities of this testbed have already been demonstrated in tests distributed over four cities. The data distribution techniques of this control architecture are described, as well as details of the current implementation and experimental results. This work has been carried out by the Universities Space Automation/Robotics Consortium (USA/RC), which includes four Texas universities in conjunction with NASA's Johnson Space Center.

This causes large fluctuations in the latency times and transfer rates; these fluctuations also create difficulties for classic tight-loop control strategies <ref> [1] </ref>. We overcome this problem by using a combination of strategies.

Reference-contexts: In a data centered system, programs communicate with one another by specifying the types of data they want to receive (and send) rather than the address of a particular process which with they must communicate. This approach is used in blackboard systems <ref> [6] </ref> and object oriented programming languages. Since each module is concerned only with the data it sends and receives, it is not affected when other modules are replaced, added and removed.
