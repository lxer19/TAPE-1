Reference-contexts: The fundamental theorem of Daubechies and Lawton is that ' 0 j is a tight frame for L 2 (R) for any wavelet matrix a (see <ref> [3] </ref>, [13]), i.e., any f 2 L 2 (R) has an L 2 expansion of the form f = f k ' 0 X j j where f k = f (x)' 0 j Z j For a generic wavelet matrix, (2.6) is an orthonormal system, and (2.7) is the usual

Reference-contexts: In this case (2.6) is an orthonormal basis for L 2 (R), and (2.7) and (2.8) hold as before. In Daubechies' new book <ref> [4] </ref> is a thorough discussion of all of these issues. In particular, the Daubechies wavelets have specific differentiability properties, namely, ' 2 C ff (g) , where ff is affine linear, and for g 3, ' 2 C 1 ; which is all we will need in this paper.

Reference-contexts: A number of authors have used such wavelet systems for solving various problems in differential and integral equations (see [7,12,2,1,19,17]). An additional point of view for approaching boundary value problems in partial differential equations was introduced in <ref> [18] </ref>, in which the boundary, the boundary data, and the unknown solution (of a boundary value problem) on the interior of a domain are all uniformly represented in terms of compactly supported wavelet functions in an extrinsic ambient Euclidean space.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION The recently introduced compactly supported wavelets of Daubechies have proven to be very useful in various aspects of signal processing, notably in image compression (see, e.g., <ref> [23] </ref>). The fundamental idea in the application to image compression was to take a digitized image and to use wavelets to provide a multiscale representation of it, and to then discard some information at some scales, and leave information more intact at other scales.
