Title: The NSFNET Backbone Network 1,2  
Author: David L. Mills Hans-Werner Braun 
Affiliation: Electrical Engineering Department University of Delaware  Computer Center University of Michigan  
Abstract: The NSFNET Backbone Network interconnects six supercomputer sites, several regional networks and ARPANET. It supports the DARPA Internet protocol suite and DCN subnet protocols, which provide delay-based routing and very accurate timesynchronization services. This paper describes the design and implementation of this network, with special emphasis on robustness issues and congestion-control mechanisms.

Some sites are connected to other backbone networks such as ARPANET and public data networks as well. The Backbone uses the DARPA Internet architecture, which is based on the IP and TCP protocols [8]. <p> There are two list formats, a short format with indexed entries used when the neighbors share the same subnet and a long format including the IP address used in other cases. The routing algorithm is a member of the Bellman-Ford class <ref> [1] </ref>, which includes those formerly used in the ARPANET and presently used in several Internet gateway systems. The measured roundtrip delay to the neighbor is added to each of the delay estimates in its HELLO message and compared with the corresponding delay estimates in the Host Table.

Reference-contexts: There is no restriction on the particular range or ranges assigned a virtual host, so that these hosts can be multi-homed at will and in possibly exotic ways. The mapping function also supports the subnetting and filtering functions outlined in <ref> [2] </ref>. By convention, one of the addresses assigned to a virtual host in each physical host is declared the base address of the physical host itself. Entries in these tables can be pre-configured or dynamically updated using the HELLO, ICMP, ARP and EGP protocols.

Reference-contexts: These data should be compared with the weekly statistics collected for the seven ARPANET/ MILNET gateways operated by Bolt Beranek Newman for the Defense Communication Agency <ref> [3] </ref>. These gateways, which operate in an environment similar to the Backbone, drop an arriving packet when the output queue for an ARPANET/MILNET destination subnet address exceeds eight packets.

Reference-contexts: The agent, now installed at all Backbone sites, mitigates routes computed by other routing systems, such as RIP and/or EGP, and communicates with the Backbone node using the HELLO protocol. It consists of a portable C-language program for the Berkeley 4.3 Unix system distribution <ref> [5] </ref>. Among the features implemented in the routing agent are exclusion lists, which delete selected networks known to the local routing algorithm from HELLO messages sent to the Backbone node. Others include calculation of the metric transformations, when required, and management of the various data bases involved.

Reference-contexts: Note that these conditions require careful analysis of the finite-precision arithmetic involved and the errors inevitably introduced. Several of the Backbone nodes are connected to extensive regional networks, some of which use a routing protocol called the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) <ref> [6] </ref>. In some cases a regional network is connected to more than one Backbone node. A typical case involves the translation between RIP and HELLO at both sites, in which case the above conditions come into play.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction and Background The NSFNET is a loosely organized community of networks funded by the National Science Foundation to support the sharing of national scientific computing resources, data and information <ref> [7] </ref>. NSFNET consists of a large number of industry and academic campus and experimental networks, many of which are interconnected by a smaller number of regional and consortium networks. The NSFNET Backbone Network is a primary means of interconnection between the regional networks and is the subject of this report.

Reference-contexts: Some sites are connected to other backbone networks such as ARPANET and public data networks as well. The Backbone uses the DARPA Internet architecture, which is based on the IP and TCP protocols <ref> [8] </ref>. Most of the regional and consortium networks, as well as the campus networks they connect also use these protocols. There are several thousand service hosts and gateways connected to the Internet, as well as many more personal computers and workstations.

Reference-contexts: The Fuzzball software has been rebuilt, modified, tinkered and evolved over several generations spanning a twenty-year period <ref> [9] </ref>. It has characteristics similar to many other operating systems, in some cases shamelessly borrowing their features and in others incorporating innovative features well before other systems made these features popular. Originally, the Fuzzball was designed primarily as an investigative tool and prototyping workbench.

Reference-contexts: As specified, EGP by is designed primarily to provide routing information between the core system and stub systems. In fact, only the core system can provide routing information for systems not directly connected to each other. The enhancements to EGP described in <ref> [14] </ref> suggest restructuring the Internet as a number of autonomous-system confederations, as well as an outline for a universal metric. Neither the baseline or enhanced EGP model is adequate to cope with the evolving requirements of NSFNET.

In addition, a special UDP-based server has been implemented <ref> [15] </ref> so that cumulative statistics can be gathered from all nodes with minimum impact on ongoing service. At present, statistics are gathered on an hourly basis from every node and incorporated in a data base suitable for later analysis.

Reference-contexts: In order to preserve the non-negative character of the metrics, both F h r must be positive and mono tone-increasing functions of their arguments. It is not difficult to show <ref> [16] </ref> that loops will not occur if both of the following conditions are sat isfied: and (1) As long as these conditions are satisfied and both the domains and ranges are restricted to non-negative values, mutually inverse functions for F h r can readily be found, such as linear transformations Ax <p> In fallback algorithms a finer distinction is necessary in order to determine whether a primary or fallback path is in use; therefore, the metric has three values: zero, one and infinity. It is not difficult to invent metric transformations which preserve this distinction without introducing loops <ref> [16] </ref>. Fallback routing is now used by the EGP-speaking gateways between the various Backbone site networks and the core system. For each Backbone network one of these gateways is designated primary and uses an EGP metric of zero, while the remaining gateways are designated fallback and use a nonzero metric.

Reference-contexts: Previous designs drop 9 arriving packets when the buffer pool becomes congested, which has unfortunate consequences for fairness and end-to-end performance. Simply increasing the size of the buffer pool does not help <ref> [17] </ref>. In addition, it has long been suspected that a major cause of Internet traffic surges is defective transport-level implementations or antisocial queueing policies, resulting in large, uncontrolled bursts of packets.

Reference-contexts: End-to-end reliability is maintained using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [22], which assembles and reorders datagrams (protocol data units) received over possibly diverse and unreliable paths using retransmissions as necessary. The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) <ref> [19] </ref> provides direct IP datagram access for transaction services, including routing and network control in some cases. 3 Since the basic service expected of the Backbone is connectionless, no provision for end-to-end reassembly, reordering or retransmission is necessary.
