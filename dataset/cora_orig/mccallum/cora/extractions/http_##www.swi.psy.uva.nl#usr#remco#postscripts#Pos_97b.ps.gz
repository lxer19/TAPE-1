Abstract: A knowledge-level analysis of complex tasks like diagnosis and design can give us a better understanding of these tasks in terms of the goals they aim to achieve and the different ways to achieve these goals. In this paper we present a knowledge-level analysis of redesign. Redesign is viewed as a family of methods based on some common principles, and a number of dimensions along which redesign problem solving methods can vary are distinguished. By examining the problem-solving behavior of a number of existing redesign systems and approaches, we came up with a collection of problem-solving methods for redesign and developed a task-method structure for redesign. In constructing a system for redesign a large number of knowledge-related choices and decisions are made. In order to describe all relevant choices in redesign problem solving, we have to extend the current notion of possible relations between tasks and methods in a PSM architecture. The realization of a task by a PSM, and the decomposition of a PSM into subtasks are the most common relations in a PSM architecture. However, we suggest to extend fl This work has been funded by NWO/SION within project 612-322-316, Evolutionary design in knowledge-based systems (the REVISE-project). Participants in the REVISE-project are: the TWIST group at the University of Twente, the SWI department of the University of Amsterdam, the AI department of the Vrije Universiteit van Amsterdam and the STEVIN group at the University of Twente. these relations with the notions of task refinement and method refinement. These notions represent intermediate decisions in a task-method structure, in which the competence of a task or method is refined without immediately paying attention to the operationalization in terms of subtasks. Explicit representation of this kind of intermediate decisions helps to make and represent decisions in a more piecemeal fashion.

Reference-contexts: Competence refinement of a problem solving method may introduce both additional teleological assumptions on the precise definition of the functional specification of a PSM as well as additional ontological assumptions on additional knowledge structures that should be available in the domain knowledge. According to <ref> (Akkermans et al., 1994) </ref>, the competence description of a method or goal describes its problem space and requirements on the solution it produces.

Reference-contexts: Search-based substitution methods can be further specialized by considering the additional knowledge necessary for searching: query memory (Hinrichs & Kolodner, 1991) requires information on what to look for, in the form of a partial description of the item searched for. Local search, which can e.g. be found in PLEXUS <ref> (Alterman, 1986) </ref>, requires instructions on where to search for alternatives. Specialized search, which can e.g. be found in the SWALE system (Schank & Leake, 1989), requires instructions on how to find an alternative.

Reference-contexts: We tried to use this framework to establish a task-method structure for problem solving behavior of different redesign systems and approaches, similar to the task-method structure for diagnosis presented in <ref> (Benjamins, 1993) </ref>. However, although the PSM architecture in (Fensel & Straatman, 1996) is rich, it does not adequately cover all types of design decisions we encountered.

Reference-contexts: The idea is that PSMs provide solutions to tasks by making assumptions about the precise definition of their functionality, and about the available domain knowledge. With this idea in mind, <ref> (Benjamins et al., 1996) </ref> states that a problem solving method consists of three subparts (presented in figure 1): * its functional specification. This is a declarative description of the input/output behavior of the PSM. * its operational specification. This is an account of how to realize that behavior.

Reference-contexts: a separate task is based on the observation that in 5 requirements design description adaptation knowledge operational/ structure search based/ non-operational fixed/free plan based local/ derivation/ specific/ global design generic Table 1: Dimensions of redesign problems general a design problem is often initiated by a statement of needs and desires <ref> (Bernaras, 1994) </ref>. These, sometimes quite vague, needs and desires are to be interpreted and operationalized into a set of requirements suitable for automated assessment. This corresponds to the task of requirements engineering in software design (Wieringa, 1996).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The concept of reusable problem solving methods (PSMs) is present in many current knowledge engineering frameworks, e.g. Generic Tasks <ref> (Chandrasekaran, 1988) </ref>, Components of Expertise (Steels, 1990), Method-to-Task (Gennari et al., 1994), role-limiting methods (McDermott, 1988), GTMD (O'Hara & Shadbolt, 1993) and COM-MONKADS (Wielinga et al., 1993).

Reference-contexts: The task of redesign in this context produces a new temporary design description which is (hopefully) closer to the specification than the former design description. This view is the basis for the Propose Critique Modify family of design methods discussed in <ref> (Chandrasekaran, 1990) </ref>. Secondly, redesign can be considered in the context of reuse. Here, redesign starts with a previously constructed design description, and a new set of requirements. The previously constructed design description must now be modified to fulfill the new set of requirements. <p> Section 3.2 discusses some examples of problem solving methods for the subtask of design modifica tion. methods are alternatives for achieving the task goal. Solid lines decompose a method into its subtasks. The main difference between the REVISE model and other models for (re)design, like Propose Critique Modify <ref> (Chandrasekaran, 1990) </ref>, lies in the inclusion of the task of requirement management in the redesign process. In our point of view, explicit management of requirements is essential in non routine redesign: addition, retraction and modification of the original requirements often forms a major part of any non routine redesign task.

Reference-contexts: Within this project the redesign of technical systems (van Eldonk et al., 1996), engineering simulation models (Pos et al., 1996b), compositional architectures (Brazier et al., 1996a) and control knowledge in knowledge based systems <ref> (Straatman, 1995) </ref> is studied. The number of knowledge based decisions made during the design of a redesign system is large and diverse. In order to describe all relevant choices and decisions, we need to extend the current notion of possible relations between tasks and methods. <p> These systems focus on redesign of compositional architectures (Brazier et al., 1996a) and redesign of control knowledge in knowledge based systems <ref> (Straatman, 1995) </ref>, respectively. Acknowledgments This paper has been significantly influenced by many discussions in the REVISE project. We would like to thank all other REVISE participants for their input. We would also like to thank Tim Menzies for his extensive comments on this paper.

Reference-contexts: These, sometimes quite vague, needs and desires are to be interpreted and operationalized into a set of requirements suitable for automated assessment. This corresponds to the task of requirements engineering in software design <ref> (Wieringa, 1996) </ref>. Figure 4 presents a partial task-method structure for the requirement management task. methods and ellipses represent tasks. Dashed lines indicate that methods are alternatives for achieving the task goal. Solid lines decompose a method into its subtasks. Dotted lines indicate competence refinement of tasks or methods. <p> The task of requirement management has not often been modeled in other (re)design models, but is in our view essential in non-routine design. Requirement management in design corresponds to the task of requirements engineering in software design <ref> (Wieringa, 1996) </ref>. Each of these redesign subtasks can be achieved by one or more problem solving methods. In this paper we selected two subtasks, requirement management and design modification, and described informal but detailed task-structures for these subtasks. For the other redesign subtasks similar task-structures have been developed.
