Abstract: Recent 1d studies of cylindrical crossed-field diodes indicate that the dimension(s) transverse to the gap may play a role in delaying onset of virtual cathode oscillations for currents above the limiting current. Transverse space charge effects in smooth electrodes diodes may produce fields which warm the electrons in both the transverse and longitudinal components of velocity. Thermal emission of electrons damps virtual cathode oscillations. The effects of the transverse dimension are explored using two-dimensional planar PIC codes. The simulations confirm that adding the transverse direction does delay the onset of virtual cathode oscillations.

Reference-contexts: Current injection above limiting current results in virtual cathode oscillations. In examining the limiting current in cylindrical diodes of one and two dimensions, Gopinath et al. <ref> [2] </ref> noted a transverse space charge effect in 2d which appeared to damp virtual cathode oscillations for currents in excess of the limiting current. In this paper, the preceding works are extended to two-dimensions. The issues of numerical and physical instability are also investigated.

The cutoff is well known; a summary is given in the text by Birdsall and Bridges <ref> [3] </ref>. Recently, Verboncoeur and Birdsall [6] performed one-dimensional simulations confirming the Hull cutoff as the limiting stable current for a space-charge limited planar diode, and examined the rapid reduction of transmitted current for injection currents above the current limit at the Hull cutoff. <p> At the Hull cutoff, with u 0 = 0, the limiting current is given by J c =J CL = 9=4, where J CL is the unmagnetized Child-Langmuir limiting current: J CL = 9 m V 2 For more details see Birdsall <ref> [3] </ref>, Christenson [5], and Verboncoeur [6]. For warm emission the Hull cutoff is defined the same as the cold case, Equation 1. <p> This is in contrast to the 1d results [6], which demonstrated stability with anisotropic emission temperature (v x ), but instability for isotropic emission temperature with J &gt; J c .

Reference-contexts: Hull cutoff may depend on the injected temperature but for the case examined here kT e t eV , so that any changes of the Hull cutoff for the warm case is a small perturbation of the cold case.

It should be noted here that the second term in Equation 3 increases J c for thermal distributions.

For warm emission the Hull cutoff is defined the same as the cold case, Equation 1. <p> The common parameters for these simulations are shown in Table 1. The injection current is varied from J c to 1:06J c . The 2d results obtained here are compared to the 1d results obtained by Verboncoeur and Birdsall <ref> [6] </ref>. For an injected current of J c the results are the same. The current as a function of time (Figure 3) and phase space (Figure 7) are almost identical to the 1d results (Figures 15 and 16, respectively). <p> However, the 2d diode exhibits stability for injected currents much larger than J c . This is in contrast to the 1d results <ref> [6] </ref>, which demonstrated stability with anisotropic emission temperature (v x ), but instability for isotropic emission temperature with J &gt; J c . The thermal stabilization of the unmagnetized diode was described by Birdsall and Bridges [3].
