Abstract: This paper presents strategies for reducing the impact force resulting from the collision of a kinematically redundant manipulator with an object in its environment. The Premultiplier Diagram, a tool used to derive the impact force reduction strategies presented in this paper, is introduced and discussed. Two strategies for reducing impact force are then presented. The first strategy involves adding torques to the joints of the redundant manipulator to impede motion into the object with which it collides. The second strategy involves choosing the best configuration for the impact event. Simulated results from the testing of either strategy are presented and discussed.

Reference-contexts: It is clear that minimizing penetration minimizes the impact force <ref> [3] </ref>, and so our strategies focus on minimizing the penetration of the end-effector into the object. In Section 2, we will present the Premultiplier Diagram, a tool which we will use to construct our impact force minimization strategies. <p> Introduction In this section, we present the tests performed on the strategies presented in the previous two sections, and discuss the results. The simulator used for these tests was the NASA Langley Robotics Systems Simulator (ROBSIM), which was modified extensively for use in this research <ref> [3] </ref>. 5. 2. The Testing Environment For these tests, we defined the gravity of the environment to be zero, and we allowed the end-effector to have only net motion at the time of impact.

Reference-contexts: Cai [1] provided a method for determining the im pulse of a perfectly elastic collision having a duration that is less than the controllers sampling period. Khatib and Burdick <ref> [5] </ref> modeled the impact event as non-instantaneous, but only for a non-redundant manipulator. The theories presented in this paper differ from these previous theories in that we model the impact event as having some finite duration for a redundant manipulator. <p> The matrix H is an (nxn) inertia matrix. The corresponding equation of the end-effector motion in an m-dimensional operational space can be written as <ref> [5] </ref>: (2) where B and Q are the (mx1) Coriolis/centrifugal and the gravitational forces in the operational space and F is an (mx1) generalized operational force vector. The vector P is an independent (mx1) operational parameter. <p> Khatib and Burdick in <ref> [5] </ref> offer a similar second-order model having a x = 0 (pure oscillation). We can now find a way to rate configurations based on their ability to damp the net motion, and thus reduce the impact force.

Reference-contexts: This paper addresses both ideas for minimizing impact force. Past work on impact strategies has focused on the instantaneous effects of impact, where the duration of the impact occurs in an infinitesimally small period of time. Walker <ref> [10] </ref> showed that reducing the instantaneous force of impact can be accomplished by minimizing the effective mass of the redundant manipulator. Zheng and Hemami [12] explored the relationship between abrupt changes in generalized joint rate velocities and the intensity of collision during an instantaneous impact event. <p> to derive the best configuration q before impact, which minimizes the impulse force during impact, assuming that t HDq = F MDP = t tdt Dt = F Fdt Dt = DP JDq = f q 1 T - Dq J H DP = DP 3 of 6 is given <ref> [10] </ref>. If the impact happens in the u direction, the impulse force can be minimized by obtaining the configuration of a manipulator which minimizes m u . The parameter m u can be obtained as: (15) 3. Using Correcting Torques to Minimize Impact Force 3. 1. <p> This type of strategy is called an impact planner, since it is a useful strategy for when we plan to make contact with the environment. This is a generalization of <ref> [10] </ref>. 4. 2. Basic Assumptions As in Section 3, a few assumptions will be made. In addition to those previously given, we shall assume that a one-dimensional collision task can be generalized to a two or three-dimensional case.
