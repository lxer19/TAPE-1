Abstract: In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for the coordinated manipulation of polygonal objects by independent robot fingers and an efficient decision procedure for whether a polygonal object can undergo any desired reorientation. This algorithm has good stability properties, in that it is not sensitive to small errors in the initial data and it relies on a simple control scheme. Our result is a contribution towards realistic task-level planning for robots.

Reference-contexts: This is a motion planning problem. Since the general motion planning problem was shown to be intractable <ref> [CR] </ref>, effort must be directed towards defining classes of tractable tasks that admit efficient algorithms. In this paper we study the task of coordinated manipulation of three dimensional objects and show that it is tractable by providing a low complexity control algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The object is in an equilibrium grasp if the forces applied by the three fingers intersect. If one of the fingers is displaced but continues to apply a normal force, a net torque is generated and the object rotates to an equilibrium grasp <ref> [Mas1] </ref>. The continuous pushing displacement of the finger results in a continuous rotation. The object in the previous example (Figure 1) can be moved from its initial to its final orientation by a similar control strategy.
