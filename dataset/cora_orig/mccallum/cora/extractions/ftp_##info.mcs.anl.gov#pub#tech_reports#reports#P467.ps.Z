Abstract: We study the one-dimensional system of Ginzburg-Landau equations that models a thin film of superconductor subjected to a tangential magnetic field. We prove that the bifurcation curve for the symmetric problem is the graph of a continuous function of the supremum of the order parameter. We also prove the existence of a critical magnetic field. In general, there is more than one positive solution to the symmetric boundary value problem. Our numerical experiments have shown cases with three solutions. It is still an open question whether only one of these corresponds to the physical solution that minimizes the Gibbs free energy. We establish uniqueness for a related boundary value problem.

The maximum value of OE is OE (0). We assume that K and L are given, and we solve the boundary value problem for varying h. The set of pairs (OE (0); h) forms the bifurcation curve of the system. <p> We can no longer guarantee that OE (x; ff; fi) remains positive in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, nor can we guarantee that OE and a remain finite for all x 2 [0; 1]. The fact that the right-hand sides of the equations in (2.2) have co efficients that are increasing functions of OE and a (when both are positive) 6 yields a useful comparison result. <p> We can no longer guarantee that OE (x; ff; fi) remains positive in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, nor can we guarantee that OE and a remain finite for all x 2 [0; 1]. The fact that the right-hand sides of the equations in (2.2) have co efficients that are increasing functions of OE and a (when both are positive) 6 yields a useful comparison result. We need the following form of the classical Sturm comparison theorem in the proof. <p> In fact, h c is the supremum of h (fi) over <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, since for h &gt; h c , the only point on the bifurcation curve with height h lies on the h axis and corresponds to the trivial solution. <p> gives the differential inequality a 00 (x) La (x): (3:1) Solving this inequality with the given boundary conditions on a gives a (x) h sinh ( p sinh ( p : (3:2) When h is sufficiently large, the above lower bound of a (x) can be made arbitrarily large in <ref> [1=2; 1] </ref>. We thus have a (x) 0; in [0; 1=2] ; (3:3) with k ! 1 as h ! 1. <p> The system (4.5), in fact, has another solution. It is easy to verify that v (x) = OE 0 (x); w (x) = a 0 (x) (4:7) satisfy (4.5). Note the following properties of v and w. Lemma 4 v (x) &lt; 0; w (x) &gt; 0; x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; (4:8) For any positive constant c, the functions ^v = v + cv and ^v = w + cw are solutions of (4.5). <p> Now suppose that (4.4) is not true. 13 Lemma 5 If w 0 (1) 0, then there exists a c greater than 0 such that ^v (x) 0; ^w (x) 0; x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; (4:10) and one of the two functions ^v and ^w touches the x axis tangentially at an interior point in (0; 1). Proof. Since v and v have opposite signs for x near 0, ^v cannot remain negative for all positive c.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, numerical experiments indicate that, in general, a solution to the system is not unique and not even necessarily symmetric.

We have discovered through numerical experiments examples in which there can be three nontrivial symmetric solutions.
