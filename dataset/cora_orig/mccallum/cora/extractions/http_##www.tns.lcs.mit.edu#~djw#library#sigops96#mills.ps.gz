Title: Wide-area information access to multimedia historical sources  
Author: Tim Mills and Ken Moody

Affiliation: University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory  
Abstract: An object-oriented model has been developed for heterogeneous multimedia data; this model underlies Cobra, a content-based retrieval architecture, which allows quick construction of powerful tools for wide area information access. The system is to be evaluated through case studies, the first of which is a search engine for historical records.

Reference-contexts: The tools which are applied to these representations include a stemmer and stop-word filter for the free text, and a synonym tool for the name and land representations. The textual information is managed by dynamic inverted files [CP93], whereas the dates are indexed using a two-dimensional R-Tree <ref> [BKSS90] </ref> so that range searches may be performed. A directory module deals with URLs. All this was embodied in the document class together with a document parser, which extracts the content-bearing features from the annotated document collection.

Reference-contexts: The documents are provided to a worldwide readership, and so registration and subsequent logging of users may allow conclusions to be drawn about the effectiveness of the system in terms of retrieval performance and usability. 2 Related Work Work at Xerox PARC presented an object-oriented architecture for text retrieval <ref> [CPP91] </ref> which aimed to facilitate functional modularisation, mix-and-match combination of module implementations and definition of inter-module protocols. This architecture takes a tool-centred view of the indexing process in which token streams which represent documents are passed between tools, such as stopword filters and stemmers, in a pipeline.

Reference-contexts: The search fields are each evaluated and the results combined to give a final result. The search engine is built from a user interface, a query language and a retrieval model. The resulting search engine is a probabilistic system based on the inference model <ref> [HW91] </ref>. Since users would find it unacceptable to refer to individuals by identifiers rather than by name, the user interface is responsible for refining the query so that the assignment of names is made apparent to the user.

ECLAIR <ref> [HW92] </ref> is an extensible object-oriented class library for information retrieval. The system is implemented in C++ together with an ODMS for persistent storage. As such, this represents an application development platform for IR systems and applications. In contrast to the Xerox architecture, ECLAIR is a document-centred design.

Reference-contexts: yet to tackle the problems of heterogeneous collections. 3 Background to the Historical Data In 1972 the Social Science Research Council initiated a project in which three communities would be examined with the aim of reconstructing as fully as possible the lives of individuals who lived in these selected areas <ref> [Mac89] </ref>. One of the places chosen was Earls Colne in Essex, England. The rich collection of historical records describing the village between 1400 and 1750 were transcribed, numbered and manually annotated, identifying each instance of an entity from a number of predefined categories [MHJ77].

These annotations included delimitation of dates, names, kinship relations, places and land transfers. Of particular importance to the users of these records are instances of people, places and dates. The resulting transcriptions and indices derived from them were published in microfiche form.

Reference-contexts: While this was suitable for the small number of tools considered in this work, in the context of heterogeneous document types many of these methods would be redundant. FIRE <ref> [SF95] </ref> is a design for a reusable IR framework. The framework is a program skeleton that defines the basic concepts of the IR domain and how its components interrelate.
