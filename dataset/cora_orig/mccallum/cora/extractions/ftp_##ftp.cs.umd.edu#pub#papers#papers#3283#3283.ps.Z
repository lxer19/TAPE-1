Abstract: Discretization and linearization of the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations gives rise to a nonsymmetric indefinite linear system of equations. In this paper, we introduce preconditioning techniques for such systems with the property that the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrices are bounded independently of the mesh size used in the discretization. We confirm and supplement these analytic results with a series of numerical experiments indicating that Krylov subspace iterative methods for nonsymmetric systems display rates of convergence that are independent of the mesh parameter. In addition, we show that preconditioning costs can be kept small by using iterative methods for some intermediate steps performed by the preconditioner.

Reference-contexts: Not surprisingly, alternating relaxation is more effective than horizontal relaxation, especially for convection-dominated problems. We remark that our goal here is only to demonstrate "proof-of-concept;" many other techniques for approximating the action of F 1 are possible, for both diffusion-dominated and convection-dominated flow. See, for example, <ref> [1, 4, 13, 15, 19] </ref>. In conclusion, in this paper we have shown that appropriately preconditioned Krylov sub-space methods can be used to solve the discrete Oseen equations, a linearized version of the Navier-Stokes equations, with convergence rates that are independent of the mesh size used in the discretization.

Reference-contexts: We assume in the following analysis that the pressure solution is uniquely specified in this case, e.g., by insisting that its mean is zero. Working in a conventional mixed finite element framework, we will further assume that the underlying velocity and pressure approximations are (div-)stable (see e.g., <ref> [2] </ref>, p. 57, [9], pp. 10ff, [18]), i.e., defining a mesh parameter h, a velocity space V h and a pressure space P h , there exist constants fl, , independent of h, such that (1.4) fl 2 (p; Qp) Here, Q is the pressure mass matrix, or alternatively the Grammian

Reference-contexts: Oscillations in the discrete velocity are apparent if the local mesh Reynolds number Re h = hkwk=- is greater than unity. In such situations, the addition of streamwise diffusion to the discrete system is known to give added stability, both theoretically and numerically, see <ref> [3] </ref> and [11]. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ideas using both a standard Galerkin discretization on a set of quasi-uniform grids, and a streamline-upwind scheme on a set of uniform grids. The remainder of the paper is divided into three sections.

Reference-contexts: It has been observed that the performance of relaxation methods of this type can be improved if the sweep direction follows the underlying direction of flow <ref> [4] </ref>. Our benchmark problem has a circular flow, so that no simple line relaxation can mimic the flow direction throughout . A slightly more sophisticated idea is to use an alternating line relaxation. <p> Not surprisingly, alternating relaxation is more effective than horizontal relaxation, especially for convection-dominated problems. We remark that our goal here is only to demonstrate "proof-of-concept;" many other techniques for approximating the action of F 1 are possible, for both diffusion-dominated and convection-dominated flow. See, for example, <ref> [1, 4, 13, 15, 19] </ref>.

In addition to the implementation of QMR with a coupled two-term recurrence (QMR 2 ) discussed above, we tested a version without look-ahead based on a three-term recurrence (QMR 3 ) <ref> [6] </ref>, and the definitive (Fortran) implementation of two-term QMR with look-ahead (QMR fl 2 ) from the QMRPAK directory in Netlib. For these preconditioners, the performances of the three variants were virtually identical.

Reference-contexts: The result is an immediate consequence of the Bauer-Fike Theorem <ref> [8] </ref>, p. 342, which states that for diagonalizable A = VflV 1 , any 2 (A + E) satisfies min 2 (A) j j (V) kEk, where k k is any l p -norm.

Reference-contexts: There are, however, a number of disadvantages to the time-dependent approach. Simple time discretization methods based on the l 2 -projection onto the discretely divergence-free subspace <ref> [9] </ref> have an O (h) CFL restriction on the time step, which impinges on efficiency. On the other hand, absolutely stable schemes like the method of backward characteristics are known to be sensitive to implementation issues (e.g., the need to perform quadrature, see [12]). <p> Note that the representation of the quadratic convection term in (1.1) ensures that N = N t , that is, the discrete form of the convection operator is skew-symmetric <ref> [9] </ref>, p. 53. Note that if normal velocities are specified everywhere on the boundary then the system (1.3) is singular, pressure is only unique up to a (hydrostatic) constant. <p> Working in a conventional mixed finite element framework, we will further assume that the underlying velocity and pressure approximations are (div-)stable (see e.g., [2], p. 57, <ref> [9] </ref>, pp. 10ff, [18]), i.e., defining a mesh parameter h, a velocity space V h and a pressure space P h , there exist constants fl, , independent of h, such that (1.4) fl 2 (p; Qp) Here, Q is the pressure mass matrix, or alternatively the Grammian matrix of basis <p> In either case, the mixed finite element used was the div-stable "Taylor-Hood" method based on continuous bilinear pressure with a continuous bilinear velocity field defined on four element macro-elements (see e.g., <ref> [9] </ref>, p. 30). For the Galerkin discretization, the quasi-uniform grids are chosen to resolve the details of the flow in the four corners of the domain: they are symmetric about x = 0 and y = 0, and in each quadrant the grid lines expand uniformly outwards.

Reference-contexts: However, the presence of (V) in these bounds is an artifact of the proof of the Bauer-Fike theorem; there are more subtle analyses ([8], pp. 344ff), as well as bounds that do not require diagonalizable matrices <ref> [10] </ref>. We have observed that the eigenvalues of A T are insensitive to perturbations, and we believe that the presence of (V) is pessimistic. This supposition is supported by the experimental results described below.

The streamline-upwind discretization is as described in <ref> [11] </ref>, p. 185. In this case, the block convection-diffusion operator F is perturbed by a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix A w . That is, F = - h + A w + N , where h is the discrete Laplacian obtained from the usual Galerkin formulation.

Reference-contexts: A popular approach is to compute "true" steady-state solutions of the time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations. There are many ways to do this: one way is to make use of the "characteristics" associated with the hyperbolic part of the Navier-Stokes operator via a Lagrange-Galerkin approach (for example, see <ref> [12] </ref>). The associated transpose-diffusion splitting leads to absolutely stable temporal dis-cretizations so that large time steps can be taken. At each time step, a symmetric indefinite matrix system corresponding to a time-discretized Stokes-like system must be solved. <p> On the other hand, absolutely stable schemes like the method of backward characteristics are known to be sensitive to implementation issues (e.g., the need to perform quadrature, see <ref> [12] </ref>). Even with fixed grids, efficiency is often limited by the costs associated with interpolation. In this work, we consider the alternative approach of attacking the system (1.1) directly.

Reference-contexts: All the matrices in question are implicitly parameterized by h. For simplicity, we state our results under the assumption that B of (1.3) has full rank.

A natural generalization for the discrete Oseen equations uses the block preconditioner (2.5) F 0 - Q ; where F = A+ N . <p> Not surprisingly, alternating relaxation is more effective than horizontal relaxation, especially for convection-dominated problems. We remark that our goal here is only to demonstrate "proof-of-concept;" many other techniques for approximating the action of F 1 are possible, for both diffusion-dominated and convection-dominated flow.

In conclusion, in this paper we have shown that appropriately preconditioned Krylov sub-space methods can be used to solve the discrete Oseen equations, a linearized version of the Navier-Stokes equations, with convergence rates that are independent of the mesh size used in the discretization.

Reference-contexts: To solve the preconditioned linear systems, we consider two popular Krylov subspace iter 10 ative methods for nonsymmetric systems: the restarted generalized minimum residual method GMRES (s), where s is the restart length <ref> [14] </ref>, and a simple implementation of the quasi-minimum residual method (QMR) [7] based on coupled two-term recurrences without look-ahead. We use s = 10; for this choice, the storage requirements of restarted GMRES and (our version of) QMR are essentially identical.

Reference-contexts: The relation (1.4) is crucial to the success of iterative solvers for solving discrete Stokes problems for it implies that, using a quasi-uniform mesh, the Schur complement BA 1 B t has condition number bounded independently of h. It is also known from our previous work <ref> [15] </ref> that when - ! 1, "optimal" preconditioners for the Laplacian sub-blocks give rise to "optimal" preconditioners for the Stokes problem in the sense that the spectra of the underlying discrete operators are contained in small clusters, which are bounded independently of h. <p> All the matrices in question are implicitly parameterized by h.
