Abstract: This note is a quick introduction to two proposals that would make T E X's original ".dvi" output format more useful for electronic posting and archiving of scientific documents. The first is compact auxiliary `atomic' fonts to make Knuth's CM fonts able to serve all (non-Cyrillic) European languages, by using composite characters. The second is the notion of a `multi-standard' graphics object. This was initially designed to solve the nagging problem of portable previewing of EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) graphics. But it promises much more. A single ".dvi"-based posting will be able to serve all the multifarious graphics abilities and debilities of T E X viewers and printers.

Reference-contexts: The ".tex" format (in L A T E X dialect) is currently the most popular on the pioneering preprint server ftp://xxx.lanl.gov that was initiated by Paul 1 This occurs particularly with monopolies and oligopolies, which are widespread in the world communications industry. 3 Laurent Siebenmann Ginsparg.
