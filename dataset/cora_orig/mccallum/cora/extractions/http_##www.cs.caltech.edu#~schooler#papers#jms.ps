In both cases, concurrency is supported, but only as much as the media crossbar switches or the LANs can physically support.

Participants receive appraisal of who else is involved, acknowledgment that conference state information is current and that communication is reliable.

Reference-contexts: However, impromptu feedback channels are still needed, along with support for dynamic membership. At this size, privacy becomes less practical to provide, even though it might still be desired. The IETF teleconferences were the first medium sized experiments in the Internet <ref> [4] </ref>. large Large conferences (hundreds of thousands or millions of participants) are analogous to TV broadcasts. Information is disseminated in one direction, sessions are pre-arranged or even permanent, and descriptions of sessions remain static.

Reference-contexts: The x-axis denotes users per conference, the y-axis the locality of the users (LAN vs WAN), and the z-axis depicts concurrency, or the degree to which each system supports simultaneous teleconferencing sessions. Although shared workspace applications, such as MMConf, function across WANs, they perform markedly better within LANs <ref> [10] </ref>. This comes as no surprise since to maintain an actively-changing global view of the workspace, these applications require reliable communication among all users. Typically the application is built on top of an N-by-N collection of TCP/IP streams, which can be problematic within the general Internet. <p> Therefore, we revisit our choice for a session control protocol, discuss the integration of multicast addressing and directory services into our model, and elaborate on additional techniques for bandwidth reduction and heterogeneity. 3.1 A Scalable Session Model and Its Protocols A variety of researchers have explored frameworks for well-contained conferences <ref> [1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 13, 16, 17, 22, 26, 31] </ref>; in this tightly-controlled model, complete session information is actively shared among and consistently maintained by all conference participants.

Reference-contexts: One solution is to allow only some fraction of the sources to transmit at any one time. Other researchers have suggested a market-based approach wherein a source is enabled to transmit only if there is a sufficient number of receivers requesting that source <ref> [15] </ref>. A limitation of the market-driven scheme is that the data from an enabled source would still go to all receivers, including those that had not requested that source.

Reference-contexts: Each connection manager in turn provides more detailed descriptions to its media agents, which translate the configuration requests into real-time flow specifications for underlying networks <ref> [20] </ref>. Peer connection managers work to negotiate a suitable configuration, by relying on interactions between each connection manager and its media agents, and between each media agent with underlying network services. <p> Specifically, the session manager will collect conference operating parameters from the user interface and will deliver them to these lower-level mechanisms for translation into flow specifications <ref> [20] </ref>. Before these mechanisms are deployed, it will be possible to use lightly-loaded networks as they are. While multicasting reduces bandwidth usage by senders, in N-way conferencing the receiver is still faced with a bandwidth N times that of the sender. Thus, mechanisms are also needed for reductions at receivers.

Reference-contexts: At this stage, the remote connection managers go through the same process of locating appropriate media agents and reserving the required resources. Finally, each connection manager instructs its local media agents to begin sending data, which means that the media agents establish real-time transport sessions <ref> [24] </ref>. <p> One complication is that there are a fixed number of multicast addresses. Because most telecollaborations will be transient, address assignment and re-assignment will be highly dynamic. A global scheme is required to avoid unwanted address collisions and to promote reasonable address space sharing. A plan is presented in <ref> [24] </ref> to partition addresses among a hierarchy of multicast address servers; addresses are borrowed from other servers of greater than or equal stature in the hierarchy, and servers re-use addresses by exploiting locality.

All of these systems, however, are bound in varying degrees by the number of users per conference. None provide explicit support for large numbers of concurrent conferences, due to the Internet's lack of infrastructure for real-time media and wide-scale multicast.

In addition, MMCC was -3 designed to accommodate the likelihood in a WAN environment of heterogeneity at the end systems and the need to provide robust sessions across the network [23]. <p> Popular IETF tools, such as LBL's vat, Xerox PARC's nv, INRIA's ivs, UMass' nevot and BBN's dvc, specifically use a lightweight session model to support larger conferences of widely distributed participants <ref> [25, 30] </ref>. All of these systems, however, are bound in varying degrees by the number of users per conference. None provide explicit support for large numbers of concurrent conferences, due to the Internet's lack of infrastructure for real-time media and wide-scale multicast.

Reference-contexts: CTRL: no CM, tuned for WAN (IETF tools: vat, nv, ivs, nevot, dvc) 10 3 10 4 10 1 10 2 10 0 Users/conference Locality Simultaneity Real-time teleconferencing systems, such as Etherphone/Phoenixphone, the CAR project and various CoDesk applications, support digital media over a LAN with centralized conference management (CM) <ref> [26, 31, 14, 11] </ref>. In contrast, the Touring Machine and Rapport represent a class of systems that combine analog media with centralized computer-based session control [2, 1]. In both cases, concurrency is supported, but only as much as the media crossbar switches or the LANs can physically support. <p> Therefore, we revisit our choice for a session control protocol, discuss the integration of multicast addressing and directory services into our model, and elaborate on additional techniques for bandwidth reduction and heterogeneity. 3.1 A Scalable Session Model and Its Protocols A variety of researchers have explored frameworks for well-contained conferences <ref> [1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 13, 16, 17, 22, 26, 31] </ref>; in this tightly-controlled model, complete session information is actively shared among and consistently maintained by all conference participants. Participants receive appraisal of who else is involved, acknowledgment that conference state information is current and that communication is reliable.

Reference-contexts: There is no need to build these directory capabilities from scratch. Rather, the applicability of Prospero, X.500, and/or DNS for maintaining and distributing various attributes of Internet teleconferencing will need to be explored <ref> [18, 19, 32] </ref>; such a service must support highly dynamic information, replication, and privacy enhancements. 3.5 Codification of Heterogeneity A configuration language for Internet teleconferencing must support highly detailed configuration descriptions, if a connection manager is to provide an abstraction beneath which we truly hide the details of end-system heterogeneity.

Reference-contexts: Those mechanisms will have to scale to track many connections or flows at once, perhaps using some form of aggregation. Other research projects are working on these problems, and we expect to test and to integrate their solutions as they become available <ref> [8, 9, 12, 28, 33] </ref>. Specifically, the session manager will collect conference operating parameters from the user interface and will deliver them to these lower-level mechanisms for translation into flow specifications [20]. Before these mechanisms are deployed, it will be possible to use lightly-loaded networks as they are.
