Abstract: Appears in Proceedings of the Second Israel Symposium on Theory and Computing Systems, IEEE, June 1993. Preliminary version in IBM Research Report RC 17969, May 1992. Abstract We present hard to approximate problems in the following areas: systems of representatives, network flow, and longest paths in graphs. In each case we show that there exists some ffi &gt; 0 such that polynomial time approximation to within a factor of 2 log ffi n of the optimal implies that NP has quasi polynomial time deterministic simulations. The results are derived by reduction from two prover, one round proof systems, and exemplify the ability of such reductions to yield hardness of approximations results for many different kinds of problems.

Reference-contexts: Constructing more efficient proofs leads to stronger results <ref> [FGLSS, AS, ALMSS, BGLR] </ref>. <p> In all known reductions, the difference between the models (multi prover proofs as opposed to probabilistically checkable proofs) is unimportant under a rough correspondence of the number of provers with the number of queries. For more information on the relation between the models in the approximation context see <ref> [BGLR] </ref>. 3 Solutions: A simple path in G is a solution if at each non-endpoint node of the path, the entering and exiting edges are of the same color if the node is monochromatic, and are of different colors if the node is dichromatic. <p> Recently it was shown that the longest path problem (of which our LONGEST CR PATH problem is a variant) is hard to approximate in the sense of Theorem 1.1 [KMR]. Efficient four prover proofs were constructed in <ref> [BGLR] </ref>, leading to improvement of many approximation results including those for set cover, clique, chromatic number, and MAX-3SAT. 2 Proofs, Optimization and Approximation It is convenient to view a 2P1R proof as an optimization problem; the connection between proofs and optimization is then perhaps most apparent, and one can define reductions

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The connection between (multi-prover) interactive proofs and approximation which originates in <ref> [FGLSS] </ref> has inaugurated a new and powerful approach to resolving the approximation complexity of optimization problems. Typically, one obtains results of the following form: The existence of a polynomial time approximation algorithm for problem P implies that NP has efficient deterministic simulations. <p> For example, the existence of a n fi (1) factor approximation algorithm for MAX CLIQUE implies P = NP <ref> [FGLSS, AS, ALMSS] </ref>. These results are established by reductions. Two kinds of reductions have been used. First, there are reductions made directly from interactive proofs. Second, there are reductions from optimization problems already shown hard to approximate by the first method. <p> Second, there are reductions from optimization problems already shown hard to approximate by the first method. The focus of this paper is on the first kinds of reductions. 1.1 Direct Reductions A direct reduction (from multi-prover interactive proofs), namely the MAX CLIQUE reduction <ref> [FGLSS] </ref>, is of course where this area began, so such reductions are certainly important. Perhaps what is most interesting, however, is that they have remained important in proving new problems are hard to approximate. Let us begin, however, by saying in more detail what these reductions are. <p> Constructing more efficient proofs leads to stronger results <ref> [FGLSS, AS, ALMSS, BGLR] </ref>. <p> Remark 2.20). 1.3 History and Related Work An early version of this paper appeared as [Be]. Since then there has been much progress in interactive proofs and approximation. Efficient probabilistically checkable proofs were constructed by [AS, ALMSS], improving <ref> [BFL, BFLS, FGLSS] </ref>; these results are exploited here (specifically for the second conclusion in Theorem 1.1). New reductions have established the hardness of approximation of many well known optimization problems such as the minimum chromatic number and the minimum set cover [LY1]. <p> Specifically, OPT V is "hard to approximate" in the following sense: if there exists a polynomial time, factor *() 1 approximation algorithm for OPT V then P = NP.

Following the example of the clique reduction of <ref> [FGLSS] </ref>, the reduction is computable in time (polynomial in jxj and) exponential in the complexity l of the given verifier, and in particular constructs instances of (S; G) of size (polynomial in jxj and) exponential in l.
