Abstract: This paper presents a taxonomy for open hypermedia systems. The purpose of the Flag 1 taxonomy is manifold: (1) to provide a framework to classify and concisely describe individual systems, (2) to characterize what an open hypermedia system is, (3) to provide a framework for comparing different systems in a system independent way, and (4) to provide an overview of the design space of open hypermedia systems.

Reference-contexts: The Dexter model was developed by a group of leading hypermedia researchers in a series of workshops from 1988 to 1990. The Dexter model is an attempt to capture some of the best design ideas from that time's most prominent hyperme-dia systems (e.g., Augment [7], Intermedia [19], KMS <ref> [1] </ref>, Neptune [6] and NoteCards [14]). Even though the Dexter model pre-dates most OHSs, much of the Dexter terminology is still valid when discussing OHSs [10].

Reference-contexts: Microcosm [4, 5, 15], Multicard [21], DeVise Hyperme-dia (DHM) [9, 10, 11, 12], Hyperform [24], SP3 [18], Chimera <ref> [2] </ref> and HyperDisco [26]. The fact that each of these OHSs have introduced their own hypermedia data model, architectural framework and link protocol (protocol for exchanging information with third-party applications) makes it very difficult to discuss and compare the different approaches in a system independent way.

Reference-contexts: The embedded link approach is a special case of the hyperbase approach with only two modules, a storage module and a runtime module. This approach does not explicitly distinguish between contents and structure. An example is the World-Wide Web (WWW) <ref> [3] </ref>, with the storage part being WWW servers and the runtime part being WWW browsers (e.g., Mosaic and Netscape). Link server based approaches are characterized by using third-party viewers to present and store the contents part of the hypertext.

Reference-contexts: In the past few years, several open hyperme-dia systems (OHSs) have been presented in the literature, including Sun's Link Service [20], Proxhy [16], 1 The outline of the taxonomy resembles the Danish flag as well as the flag of other Scandinavian countries.
