Reference-contexts: If the bids have at most w items each, a bound k = 2 (w + 1)=3 can be established in O (nw 2 w ) time, where is the number of bids that any given bid can share items with (note that &lt; n) <ref> [ Chandra and Halldorsson, 1999 ] </ref> . First, bids are greedily inserted into the solution on a highest-price-first basis. Then local search is used to improve the solution, and this search is terminated after a given number of steps.

A bound that depends only on the number of items, m, can also be established in polynomial time. <p> If the bids can be colored with c colors so that no two bids that share items have the same color, then a bound k = c=2 can be established in polynomial time <ref> [ Hochbaum, 1983 ] </ref> . 10 5. The bids have a -claw if there is some bid that shares items with other bids which themselves do not share items. <p> Let D be the largest d such that there is some subset of bids in which every bid shares items with at least d bids in that subset. Then, a bound k = (D+1)=2 can be established in polynomial time <ref> [ Hochbaum, 1983 ] </ref> . Approximation algorithms for these known special cases have been improved repeatedly. There is also the possibility that probabilistic algorithms could improve upon the deterministic ones. In addition, it is possible that additional special cases with desirable approximability properties will be found.

Reference-contexts: in electricity markets, equities trading, bandwidth auctions [ McAfee and McMillan, 1996, McMillan, 1994 ] , transportation exchanges [ Sandholm, 1993, Sandholm, 1991, Sandholm, 1996a ] , pollution right auctions, auctions for airport landing slots [ Rassenti et al., 1982 ] , and auctions for carrier-of-last-resort responsibilities for universal services <ref> [ Kelly and Steinberg, 1998 ] </ref> . In such domains, bidding in sequential auction protocols is difficult. To determine her valuation for an item, the bidder needs to guess what items she will receive in later auctions.

Reference-contexts: Then, when searching for bids to append to the main search path from the Bidtree, only bids with exclusion count 0 are accepted. 3 3.4 IDA* and heuristics We sped up the main search by using an iterative deepening A* (IDA*) search strategy <ref> [ Korf, 1985 ] </ref> instead of DFS. The search tree, use of the Bidtree, and the preprocessors stay the same. In practice, IDA* finds the provably optimal allocation well before the entire search tree (Figure 3) has been traversed.

Reference-contexts: Determining the winners in such protocols is easy because that can be done by picking the highest bidder for each item separately. However, in many settings, bidders have preferences over bundles, i.e. combinations of items. This is often the case for example in electricity markets, equities trading, bandwidth auctions <ref> [ McAfee and McMillan, 1996, McMillan, 1994 ] </ref> , transportation exchanges [ Sandholm, 1993, Sandholm, 1991, Sandholm, 1996a ] , pollution right auctions, auctions for airport landing slots [ Rassenti et al., 1982 ] , and auctions for carrier-of-last-resort responsibilities for universal services [ Kelly and Steinberg, 1998 ] . <p> Because every bidder would want to wait, no bidding would commence. As a patch to this problem, activity rules have been used <ref> [ McAfee and McMillan, 1996 ] </ref> . Each bidder has to bid at least a certain volume by predefined time points in the auction, otherwise the bidder's future rights are reduced in some prespecified manner. Unfortunately, the equilibrium bidding strategies in such auctions are not game-theoretically known. <p> Another approach is to allow bidders to retract their bids if they do not get the combinations that they want. For example, in the Federal Communications Committee's bandwidth auction the bidders were allowed to retract their bids <ref> [ McAfee and McMillan, 1996 ] </ref> . In case of a retraction, the item was opened for reauction. If the new winning price was lower than the old one, the bidder that retracted the bid had to pay the difference. This guarantees that retractions do not decrease the auctioneer's payoff.

In such domains, bidding in sequential auction protocols is difficult. <p> We developed a protocol where the bidders can submit XOR-bids, i.e. bids 28 on combinations such that only one of the combinations can get accepted. This allows the bidders to express general preferences with both positive and negative complementarities, see also <ref> [ Rassenti et al., 1982 ] </ref> . We also allow bids to state multiple units of each item, and we allow the bidders to submit multiple mutually nonexclusive XOR-bids.

Reference-contexts: We believe that our algorithm will make the difference between being able to use a combinatorial auction design in many practical markets and not. The IDA* search algorithm, used in our main search, can easily be distributed across multiple computers for additional speed, see e.g. <ref> [ Reinefeld and Schnecke, 1994 ] </ref> . The burden of search could also be imposed on the bidders by giving each bidder a portion of the search space to explore. This introduces two risks. First, a bidder may only search her portion partially so as to save computational effort.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, exhaustive enumeration is not a viable method for searching for the optimal allocation in most settings. 2.2 Dynamic programming The allocations (Figure 1) can be searched more efficiently than exhaustive enumeration by dynamic programming <ref> [ Rothkopf et al., 1995 ] </ref> . Based on the b (S) function, the dynamic programming algorithm determines for each set S of items the highest possible revenue that can be acquired using only the items in S. The algorithm proceeds systematically from small sets to large ones. <p> The savings compared to exhaustive search come from the fact that the revenue maximizing solutions for the subsets need not be computed over and over again, but only once. The dynamic programming algorithm takes O (3 m ) and (2 m ) steps <ref> [ Rothkopf et al., 1995 ] </ref> , which is a considerable saving over exhaustive enumeration, but still too complex to scale to large numbers of items|above about 25 in practice. The dynamic programming algorithm executes the same steps independent of the number of bids. <p> To capitalize on this idea in practice, the restrictions would have to be imposed by the auctioneer since they|at least the currently known ones <ref> [ Rothkopf et al., 1995 ] </ref> |are so severe that it is very unlikely that they would hold by chance. In this section we review the bid restrictions that have been suggested for achieving polynomial winner determination [ Rothkopf et al., 1995 ] : 1. <p> to be imposed by the auctioneer since they|at least the currently known ones <ref> [ Rothkopf et al., 1995 ] </ref> |are so severe that it is very unlikely that they would hold by chance. In this section we review the bid restrictions that have been suggested for achieving polynomial winner determination [ Rothkopf et al., 1995 ] : 1. If the bids have at most 2 items each, the winners can be optimally determined in O (m 3 ) time using an algorithm for maximum-weight matching. <p> It is based on highly optimized search. The motivation behind our approach is to * allow bidding on all combinations unlike the approach of <ref> [ Rothkopf et al., 1995 ] </ref> . This is in order not to introduce any of the inefficiencies that occur in non-combinatorial auctions. * strive for the optimal allocation.

Reference-contexts: This guarantees that retractions do not decrease the auctioneer's payoff. However, it exposes the retracting bidder to considerable risk. This risk can be eliminated by a leveled commitment protocol <ref> [ Sand-holm and Lesser, 1996, Sandholm and Lesser, 1995 ] </ref> , where the decommitting penalties are set up front, possibly on a per item basis. This protocol allows the bidders to decommit but it also allows the auctioneer to decommit.

Reference-contexts: We have shown that despite this gaming, in Nash equilibrium, the protocol can increase the expected payoff of both parties, and enable contracts which would not be individually rational to both parties via any full commitment contract <ref> [ Sandholm and Lesser, 1996, Sandholm, 1996b ] </ref> .

Another approach is to allow bidders to retract their bids if they do not get the combinations that they want.
