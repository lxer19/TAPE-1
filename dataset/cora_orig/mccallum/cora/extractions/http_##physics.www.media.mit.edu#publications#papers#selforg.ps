Abstract: In order for simple, initially identical computational units to acquire unique identities, two ingredients are needed: a physical symmetry breaking mechanism and a distributed algorithm that makes use of this mechanism. After briefly considering non-thermodynamic sources of symmetry breaking, I return to thermodynamic symmetry breaking, and present three algorithms that make use of this source. I analyze the expected resource requirements (time, random bits, space, communication) of the algorithms, and note a trade off among these measures of algorithm complexity. I close by speculating about a framework for formalizing these trade-offs and determining the theoretical optimum performance of symmetry breaking protocols.

Reference-contexts: The first well known symmetry breaking problem is the Dining Philosophers problem, posed in 1965 by Dijkstra <ref> [2] </ref>. In this problem, processes with overlapping resource requirements must be scheduled. The symmetry breaking problem arises when two processors try simultaneously to access the same resource: to break or avoid deadlock, one must yield.

Reference-contexts: These identities can then be used to break symmetry if desired, and for additional non-computational purposes such as communication. The one example in the computer science literature of using a symmetry breaking protocol to assign unique identities is a paper of Lipton and Park <ref> [4] </ref>, in which they pose what they call the Processor Identity Problem| fundamentally the same problem discussed in this paper, but set in the context of a shared memory multiprocessing system. The protocol they describe is of no use in the multiaccess-channel scenario we are considering.

Reference-contexts: In particular, a simple combinatorial argument shows that the probability of failure p f of the non-interacting protocol is m! 2 T ! Following <ref> [5] </ref>, we can bound this probability using p f 1 e n (n1)=2m = 1 e n (n1)=2 T+1 Solving this inequality for T , we find T log 2 n 2 + n Assuming that we are interested in a small probability of failure, we can make the approximation ln
