Reference-contexts: In fact, the cup product can be determined simply by studying the vectors of orbit values. We begin with a review of a few results from the renowned paper by Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand <ref> [1] </ref>. In Section 3, we introduce the nil-Coxeter algebra in order to prove that the orbit value formula is independent of the choice of reduced word. <p> Proposition 2.1. <ref> [1, Thm. 3.14 and Thm. 3.15] </ref> The Schubert classes S w 2 R=I have the property @ i S w = &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; S w i l (w) &lt; l (w i ) (2.3) Furthermore, the Schubert class S w 0 is given by S w 0 = jW <p> Below we give the correct statement in our notation. fl This notation differs from the notation in <ref> [1] </ref> by a sign.

This fact can be proven using the combinatorial interpretation for the terms in a double Schubert polynomial defined by Fomin and Kirillov <ref> [3] </ref>. Unfortunately, the Kostant polynomials for the other classical groups do not appear to be related to the double Schubert polynomials as defined by Fulton [6]. It is well known that the structure constants for the product of Schubert classes are non-negative integers.

It is well known that the structure constants for the product of Schubert classes are non-negative integers. In fact, the coefficients in the entire P u matrix are non-negative integers provided the orbit point is chosen so that each ff i (o) is a positive integer.

Reference-contexts: In Section 5, we show how the matrix of orbit values is related to the cup product in the cohomology ring for the flag manifold G=B following <ref> [8] </ref>. In fact, the cup product can be determined simply by studying the vectors of orbit values. We begin with a review of a few results from the renowned paper by Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand [1]. <p> Then, the image of K 0 w in R=I is equal to Y (fl (o)) 1 S w :(2.5) The next theorem shows that the divided difference operators satisfy a modified recursive formula. This theorem has also been given by Kostant and Kumar in <ref> [8] </ref> for the case of an arbitrary Kac-Moody Lie algebra. Theorem 1. For w 2 W the divided difference operator @ i acts on K w as follows @ i K w = &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; K w i 0 l (w) &gt; l (w i ): Proof. <p> The proof follows by Corollary 2.3 and the inductive hypothesis. Corollary 4.1. The value w K w (ov) is a non-negative integer provided ff i (o) is a positive integer for each simple root ff i . The following corollaries were also shown in <ref> [8] </ref>. Corollary 4.2. The orbit values K w (ov) and K w (ov i ) are equal if and only if l (w) &lt; l (w i ). 12 Corollary 4.3. <p> Let D = [d uv ] be the matrix with entries indexed by u; v 2 W and the entry d uv is defined y to be the orbit value u K u (ov), either computed by (2.7) or (4.3). Proposition 5.4. <ref> [8] </ref> Fix u 2 W . Let D u be the diagonal matrix with d uv along the diagonal. Let P u be the matrix of coefficients [p w uv ] from (5.1). <p> However, S. Kumar has shown that there is an analog for Corollary 2.3 which computes the orbit values starting from the identity and going up in length. y Note that our d uv corresponds with d u 1 v 1 in <ref> [8] </ref>. 7.
