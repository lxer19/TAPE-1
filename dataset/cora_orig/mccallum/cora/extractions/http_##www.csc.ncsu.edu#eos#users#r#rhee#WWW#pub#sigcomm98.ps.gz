Title: Error Control Techniques for Interactive Low-bit Rate Video Transmission over the Internet

Abstract: A new retransmission-based error control technique is presented that does not incur any additional latency in frame playout times, and hence are suitable for interactive applications. It takes advantage of the motion prediction loop employed in most motion compensation-based codecs. By correcting errors in a reference frame caused by earlier packet loss, it prevents error propagation. The technique rearranges the temporal dependency of frames so that a displayed frame is referenced for the decoding of its succeeding dependent frames much later than its display time. Thus, the delay in repairing lost packets can be effectively masked out. The developed technique is combined with layered video coding to maintain consistently good video quality even under heavy packet loss. Through the results of extensive Internet experiments, the paper shows that layered coding can be very effective when combined with the retransmission-based error control technique for low-bit rate transmission over best effort networks where no network-level mechanism exists for protecting high priority data from packet loss.

In this scheme, errors due to the loss of LP packets do not propagate because each frame is temporally dependent only on the essential signals of its reference frame which are assumed to be reliably received.

Reference-contexts: Dempsey et al.[5] applied retransmission for the recovery of audio packets. They showed that by adding some delay before the play-out of each received audio packet, retransmission can be used to protect audio data from packet loss. Their work hinges on the earlier behavior study by Brady <ref> [3] </ref> showing that although less than 200 ms round trip delay is required for high quality voice applications, delays up to 600 ms can be tolerable by human ears. Ramamurthy and Raychaudhuri [21] applied a similar technique to video transmission over ATM.

Reference-contexts: Pancha and El Zarki applied a priority packetization scheme to an MPEG encoded video stream for transmission over ATM [17].

Reference-contexts: Increasing the frequency of intra-frames could increase the bandwidth requirement too much for video transmission over a bandwidth-constraint network. Nonetheless, the severe degradation of image quality due to error propagation has forced several popular video conferencing tools, such as nv [7], vic [13] and CU-SeeMe <ref> [6] </ref>, to adopt an even more drastic approach. Using a technique called conditional replenishment, these tools filter out the blocks that have not changed much from the previous frame and intra-code the remaining blocks.

Reference-contexts: The receiving video quality will periodically fluctuate. To remedy this, we apply a layered coding technique, called quality assurance layering (QAL) <ref> [22, 15, 8] </ref>, for non-periodic frames which divides video signals into essential and enhancement signals. Essential signals are protected by a simple forward error correction (FEC) technique. <p> Shimamura et al. [22] also studied the effect of various priority packetization techniques including frequency truncation. Ghanbari <ref> [8] </ref> proposed similar layering techniques as QAL. In the techniques, each frame is first decimated to produce a low-resolution image, then the low-resolution image is coded using H.261 or a DCT-based codec and packetized as HP data.

Reference-contexts: This coding scheme will have similar error resilience as the QAL technique since the LP data depend only on the HP data. MPEG-2 adopts an approach similar to this. Khansari et al. <ref> [10] </ref> applied QAL to video transmission over a mobile network to solve the "fading" problem commonly experienced during a mobile host hand-off period. By keeping the size of the HP stream large (about 83% of the total bandwidth), video quality even under fading can be kept relatively high. <p> Due to low compression efficiency, QAL has been traditionally used in a situation where a large portion of bandwidth can be allocated to the HP stream (about 50% to 80% of the total bandwidth) <ref> [10] </ref>. Under the current Internet environment, this may not be reasonable. PTDD provides a good compromise for these conflicting requirements.

In this paper, we showed that the H.261 equipped with our REC schemes achieves comparable error resilience to that of INTRA-H.261.

Reference-contexts: Since the amount of essential signals is often much smaller than that of the entire signals, with only a little FEC redundant information, we can maintain relatively good video quality. QAL is different from the technique adopted in vic <ref> [14] </ref> in that QAL uses motion compensation. In QAL, frames temporally depend only on the essential signals of their reference frames. This dependency ensures that the distortion of the enhancement signals of a frame does not affect the quality of its succeeding frames. <p> Another benefit of the codec is the reduced computation in encoding since it does not involve a motion prediction loop. A layering scheme for Intra-H.261 using a bit plane division technique is also discussed in <ref> [2, 14] </ref>. Quality assurance layering (QAL) was studied in [22, 15].

In this paper, we showed that the H.261 equipped with our REC schemes achieves comparable error resilience to that of INTRA-H.261. <p> In this case, although real-time receivers may get the video in similar quality as the motion-compensation scheme with REC, non-real-time receivers will receive a poor quality video. Note that this feature is different from media scaling <ref> [14] </ref> where receivers with a higher network capacity always get a higher quality image. Here, this feature allows even the receivers with a low network capacity to get a high quality while trading interact-ability.
