Title: Fast computation of a contrast-invariant image representation  
Author: Pascal Monasse, Frederic Guichard 
Keyword: Image representation, Image coding, Mathematical morphology, Contrast invariance.

Abstract: This article exposes a new representation of an image which is contrast independant. The image is decomposed into a tree of "shapes" based on connected components of level sets, which provides a full and non-redundant representation of the image. A fast algorithm to compute the tree, the Fast Level Set Transform, is explained in details. Some simple and direct applications of this representation are shown.

Reference-contexts: Up: we display the results of the smoothing, and the respective kernels of scale 1, 2 then 4, from left to right. Down: we display the zero-crossing of the laplacian, and the kernels that correspond to the laplacian at the scales used upward. "model" <ref> [10] </ref>. The class is generally chosen so that the functions can be interpreted easily. An example of simple class is the piecewise constant images having a bounded discontinuity length. With such a class, the boundaries of the approximated image are interpreted as the "edges".

Reference-contexts: Finally, we attribute to each pixel in the image the gray level of the smallest shape containing it.

In the experiments presented in this article, we stored in addition the original gray level of the shape. So that we can reconstruct an image with comparable contrast for visual convenience.

Reference-contexts: At scale 800, all shapes having an area less than 800 pixels have been removed, it is a drastic simplification of the image! Note that this look-like segmentation is not based on the contrast. This scale dependent representation is an implementation of a filtering proposed by S. Masnou in <ref> [19] </ref>. This simplification of the image is also close to the one proposed by Luc Vincent, in [20]. Indeed, he proposed to eliminate small connected components successively of the upper level sets, and then of the lower level sets.

But, with respect to the scaled inclusion tree, first this method introduces a disymmetry between black and white objects.
