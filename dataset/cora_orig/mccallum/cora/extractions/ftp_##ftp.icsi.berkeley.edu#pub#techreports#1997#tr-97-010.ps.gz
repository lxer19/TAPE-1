Reference-contexts: In general CBR=systems the user can represent knowledge explicitly in at least three ways. AS an example, they are all realized in the INRECA-system (cf. <ref> [Althoff et al.95] </ref>): (i) Exclusion rules: They describe constraints on the retrieved cases. This is some filtering; examples are restricting equalities as x = a or inequalities as x a or x a.

Reference-contexts: Abstract concepts in fuzzy systems occur in linguistic rules. Although the notions of similarity and abstraction have much in common their detailed interplay is somewhat delicate. A realization was obtained in the PARIS-system, see <ref> [Bergmann 96] </ref>. IX.2 Suggestions for integrating techniques The integration of different techniques can be obtained on various levels of intensity. This reaches from hybrid systems where the individual methods are simple available to a seamless integration where the components are invisible to the user.

Reference-contexts: VIII. Categories The representation of classes by a case base and a similarity measure where decreasing similarities of elements of the case base correspond to a decreasing membership to the class has a tradition in cognitive science. Here one distinguishes between a concept and a category (cf. <ref> [ Lackoff 87] </ref>). A concept in the traditional sense has a precise definition and each element either satisfies this definition and belongs to the concept or it does not. Categories need not to have definitions but have typical elements called prototypes. <p> Such categories occur frequently in every day life and decision support systems should take this into account (what is not yet the case). One kind of categories is of the form described above where the degree of membership is given by the similarity to the prototypes. In <ref> [ Lackoff 87] </ref> it is argued that many important categories are not of this form and can in addition not be represented as fuzzy sets. Such a principal statement is probably too strong. What seems to more likely is that the fuzzy approach is not always suitable.

Reference-contexts: This in turn has the consequence that the demands on the accuracy usually are not as strong as when numerical values are involved. Most of the major advantages of CBR are related to knowledge and software engineering issues as pointed out in <ref> [Maurer 96] </ref> and [Althoff et al.97]. The main point is here that software products are not regarded as static elements which remain unchanged through their life time; this is only for very dedicated 15 software products the case (which applies e.g. for certain systems in fuzzy control).

Reference-contexts: It depends mainly on the skill of the system designer and the user how this is done. An explicit representation requires a language with a clearly defined semantics (which should be closely related tom the intuitive understanding of the knowledge). In this language the knowledge is formulated. In <ref> [Richter 95b] </ref> we introduced the concept of knowledge container and studied it for CBR. The knowledge containers are parts of the system in which knowledge can be represented and which can be treated independently of each other.
