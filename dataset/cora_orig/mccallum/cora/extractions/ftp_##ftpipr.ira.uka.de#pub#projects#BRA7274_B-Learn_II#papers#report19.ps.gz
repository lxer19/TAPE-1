Reference-contexts: We conclude with a discussion of related and future work in Section 6. 2 The General Setting We are developing the tool within the context of a robot navigation domain, to which inductive algorithms are applied, in order to learn operational concepts. These concepts were introduced in <ref> [1] </ref>. They are to be used by a robot to perform flexibly user-defined tasks, such as move through the door, turn right, and move to the cupboard. Operational concepts, on one hand, provide the basis for high-level planning. <p> The focus is on representational issues, i.e., we deal with the question, about what information is represented at each level of the abstraction hierarchy, and how these descriptions are generated from the real-world data. In <ref> [1] </ref>, operational concepts were introduced, which are abstract descriptions of concepts, such as move through the door, and move along the wall. They constitute the interface between a human user and a robot: The user uses operational concepts to guide the robot in known as well as unknown environments.

Reference-contexts: The fact, that the tool works on a restricted first-order logic representation formalism, does not confine its use to a specific domain nor to the two learning algorithms, which we have used. In principle, it can be used for any ILP-algorithm (as for example those presented in [6] and <ref> [2] </ref>), which require training sets consisting of examples E and background knowledge B, which contain ground literals. It is a known fact, that for all learning algorithms the composition of appropriate training and test sets is crucial.

Reference-contexts: view of the enormous amount of data, from which the right one has to be selected for putting together a specific training set, the question is, whether the access to the data cannot be made more efficient by using databases and by coupling the tool with the RDT/DB-method developed in <ref> [3] </ref>. Nevertheless, the tool has already been successfully applied, in order to prepare training sets for two different types of logic-based learningx algorithms.

In <ref> [4] </ref>, we introduced the term jump for these kind of edge groupings, consisting of two parallel edges. Other edge groupings, which are considered, are convex and concave corners, and singular edges, called line.

Reference-contexts: Different ILP-algorithms, which are integrated in the MOBAL-system <ref> [5] </ref>, have been applied to learn rules, which derive higher-level concepts of the abstraction hierarchy in rules, which derive action-oriented perceptual features, sensor group features, and sensor features, are given in the following: through_door (Trace,Start,End,parallel) &lt;- sg_jump (Trace,left,T1,T2,parallel) & sg_jump (Trace,right,T1,T2,parallel) & Start &lt; T1 & T2 &lt; End.

Reference-contexts: In the case of basic features these time points appear as fourth and fifth argument of the basic features. In the case of the ILP-algorithms, the hypothesis space, H, consists of Horn clauses. In the case of the algorithm, presented in <ref> [7] </ref>, it consists of the class of deterministic finite state automata and probabilistic automata, respectively. These automata accept as input sequences of observations, i.e., ground instances of basic features, which are accepted, if they lead to a final state, which represent concepts, i.e., sensor features. <p> The transformation can be realized by using the declarations of the abstraction levels for sensor features and basic features, respectively. The algorithm for inferring automata, presented in <ref> [7] </ref>, uses as training data sequences of observations in temporal order, which have or do not have to be accepted by the learned automaton.

Reference-contexts: For this purpose, different algorithms have been implemented: As we are working within a restricted first-order logic framework, the initial data has to be transformed from a numerical, tabular representation to a relational one. Wessel <ref> [9] </ref> has implemented a program, which calculates basic features from sensor measurements. The calculation is influenced by different parameters, which reflect the sensitivity to changes in the measurements.
