Abstract: Currently, the Dutch Customs Department is building a nationwide information system to handle all kinds of declarations related to the import and export of goods. For this purpose the Petri-net-based Workflow Management System (WFMS) named COSA has been selected. During the selection process, it turned out that there are several reasons for insisting on a Petri-net-based WFMS. The three main reasons for selecting a Petri-net-based WFMS are discussed in this paper. In our opinion these reasons are also relevant for many other projects involved in the selection or implementation of a WFMS.

Reference-contexts: This situation of disorder and lack of consensus resulted in an incomprehensive set of DBMSs. However, emerging standards such as the Relational Data Model (Codd, 1970) and the Entity-Relationship Model <ref> (Chen, 1976) </ref> led to a common formal basis for many DBMSs. As a result the use of these DBMS boosted. There are many similarities between today's WFMSs and the DBMSs of the early 70-ties. Despite the efforts of the Workflow Management Coalition a real conceptual standard is missing.

Reference-contexts: In the beginning of the 70-ties most of the pioneers in the field of DBMSs were using their own ad-hoc concepts. This situation of disorder and lack of consensus resulted in an incomprehensive set of DBMSs.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, it is easy to link a Petri-net-based WFMS to an existing simulation tool. If the duration of a task can be modeled by a negative-exponential distribution, then the corresponding Generalized Stochastic Petri Net (GSPN) can also be analyzed by Markovian analysis techniques <ref> (Marsan, Balbo & Conte, 1986) </ref>. If the duration of a task can be modeled by a pessimistic and an optimistic estimate (i.e. an interval), then the corresponding Interval Timed Colored Petri Net (ITCPN), can be analyzed using the MTSRT method presented in Aalst (1993).

Reference-contexts: Clearly, the abundance of analysis techniques developed for Petri nets, enables the user of a Petri-net-based WFMS to analyze a workflow process in various ways (including simulation). In the Sagitta-2000 project we used the Petri-net-based analysis tools ExSpect (ASPT, 1994) and INA <ref> (Starke, 1992) </ref> for simulation purposes and structural analysis. 6 Conclusion Today's situation with respect to workflow management software is comparable to the situation as regards to database management software in the early 70-ties.
