Abstract: Access-Limited Logic (ALL) is a theory of knowledge representation which formalizes the access limitations inherent in a network structured knowledge-base. Where a deductive method such as resolution would retrieve all assertions that satisfy a given pattern, an access-limited logic retrieves only those assertions reachable by following an available access path. The time complexity of inference in ALL is a polynomial function of the size of the accessible portion of the knowledge-base, rather than an exponential function of the size of the entire knowledge-base (as in much past work). Access-Limited Logic, though incomplete, still has a well defined semantics and a weakened form of completeness, Socratic Completeness, which guarantees that for any fact which is a logical consequence of the knowledge-base, there is a series of preliminary queries and assumptions after which a query of the fact will succeed. Algernon implements Access-Limited Logic. Algernon is important in testing the claims that common-sense knowledge can be encoded cleanly using access paths, and that in common-sense reasoning the preliminary queries and assumptions can generally be determined from domain knowledge. In this paper we overview the principles of ALL and discuss the application of Algernon to three domains: expert systems, qualitative model building, and logic puzzles.

The most common solution to this problem has been to combine fast, special purpose inference with a first-order logic theorem prover [4, 21] or a weaker deduction system [Levesque, 84, Patel-Schneider, 85, Vilain, 85].

Reference-contexts: If a knowledge representation language is as expressive as first-order predicate calculus, then the problem of deciding what an agent could logically deduce from its knowledge is unsolvable <ref> [3] </ref>. Thus a knowledge-representation system must either give up expressive power or completeness 1 .

Reference-contexts: Algernon has also been used to support our work on qualitative model building <ref> [7] </ref>. In general, the reasoning required for model building is `straight line' reasoning | it involves no proofs by contradiction or reasoning by cases. Partitional boundaries occasionally had to be adjusted in order to make sure that model building did not terminate prematurely.

Reference-contexts: We refer to this as if-added/if-needed incompleteness. An example of if-added/if-needed incompleteness is shown in figure 1. Second, Algernon allows the knowledge-base to be partitioned. Partitions limit rule backchaining | facts in other partitions are simply retrieved (for details see <ref> [8] </ref>). Finally, in the presence of negation, there may be logical consequences of the knowledge-base which cannot be derived by simple rule application. Such deductions can be drawn in Algernon by making assumptions and then reasoning by contradiction.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, ALL is Socratically Complete: for any fact which is a semantic consequence of the knowledge base, there is a sequence of preliminary queries and assumptions, after which a query of the fact will succeed <ref> [10, 9] </ref>. While these formal properties are important, they do not necessar ily guarantee that ALL can actually be used to represent knowledge. <p> Time complexity and So-cratic Completeness are formal properties which have been shown elsewhere <ref> [9] </ref>. The claim that the representation and inference mechanisms in ALL are sufficient for a large class of common-sense reasoning problems can necessarily only be proven or disproven empirically. <p> This section describes Algernon in sufficient depth that the example below can be understood. For a more detailed discussion see <ref> [9] </ref>. The expressive power of Algernon greatly exceeds that of ALL. Algernon supports full first order quantification (which we are in the process of adding to ALL), and a general mechanism for escaping to lisp. <p> Thus an assertion of (not (likes suzan chocolate)) says that suzan does not like chocolate. 2 Algernon also supports several special forms. Short descriptions of the most important special forms are given below. The full syntax of all special forms is given in <ref> [9] </ref>. :taxonomy Adds to the basic taxonomic structure in the knowledge-base. The taxonomic structure of sets forms the "backbone" of an Algernon knowledge-base. Sets are described by lists whose elements are (names of) the members of the sets and whose sublists are subsets of the set. <p> Logically this entails (r3 c c), but this deduction cannot be drawn in Algernon without first querying (r1 c c). 4 Applications of Algernon Algernon has been used by a graduate level expert systems class and several simple expert systems have been built using it <ref> [9] </ref>. In general, expert systems are rule based and do not depend on complex reasoning (e.g., proofs by contradiction). Thus the incompleteness of Algernon was not a problem in these applications. The access path restrictions also seemed to pose no difficulties. <p> Declarations for the slots unique to the bank problem are also shown. Several generally useful slots (e.g., coreferent, less, least, one-to-one) are defined in Algernon's `background' knowledge-base (see <ref> [9] </ref>). Notice that we explicitly create frames for `the cashier', `the manager', and `the teller'. Solving the problem then becomes a matter of deriving appropriate coreference links between these frames and the frames for Brown, Jones, and Smith. Initially Algernon is unable to derive these coreference relations. <p> Such an approach might be useful for deriving the best solution possible within some time bound. Space limitations prevent a fair review of the large body of related work. The interested reader is referred to <ref> [9] </ref>. Algernon has been an important part of our work in ALL. It has been critical, both in testing new constructs for knowledge-representation, and in empirically investigating the problem of query and assumption generation. More recently it has been used to support our work in qualitative model building.
