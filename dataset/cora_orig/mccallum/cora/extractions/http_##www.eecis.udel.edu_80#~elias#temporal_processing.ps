Abstract: The artificial dendritic tree, as part of a silicon neuromorph, is modelled as a multibranched, passive cable structure. Synaptic activations are either depolarizing (excitatory), hyperpolarizing (inhibitory), or shunting. Contemporaneous synaptic activation at widely separated sites on the tree result in linear summation of their effects, as do neighboring excitatory and inhibitory activations; activation of synapses of the same type close in time or space produce local saturation of potential resulting in sublinear summation. Linear summation and saturation, both physiologically plausible, are exploited to allow a single neuromorph to discriminate pulse intervals, pulse frequencies, or detect correlation between input trains.

Reference-contexts: EXPERIMENTAL HARDWARE SYSTEM Our silicon neuron, or neuromorph, comprises an artificial dendritic tree (ADT) <ref> (Elias, 1993) </ref>, and an integrate-and-fire soma (Fig.1b). The ADT branches are composed of a series of identical compartments each with a capacitor C m , representing a membrane capacitance, and two programmable resistors, R a and R m , representing the axial cytoplasmic and membrane resistances. <p> The integrator RC of the spike generator was 0.75 msecs. A digital-to-analog converter input to the comparator (Fig.1b) set the spike firing threshold V th . The neuromorph under study was embedded in the virtual wire system previously described <ref> (Elias, 1993) </ref>. This system allows spikes generated by neuromorphs to be distributed with programmable delays to arbitrary synapses throughout a network. A host computer generated both the timing and synaptic patterning of spikes supplied to the neuromorph.

Reference-contexts: Examples of excitatory impulse responses are shown in negative-going. The shape of the impulse response depends upon dendrite dynamics, which by means of the adjustable resistors R a and R m , is programmable over a range of six orders of magnitude <ref> (Elias & Northmore, 1995) </ref>. Experiments were performed on a single neuromorph consisting of an 8-branch ADT fabricated with a 2 mm CMOS double-poly n-well process on a 2 x 2 mm MOSIS Tiny Chip format. <p> Saturation effects may also be prolonged by reducing the diffusion of charge from the compartment along the dendrite by increasing the axial resistance, R a . Thus, all interval and frequency selective effects can be tuned by varying the dendritic dynamics <ref> (Elias & Northmore, 1995) </ref>. Longitudinal diffusion of charge from a compartment can also be inuenced by contemporaneous synaptic activations in neighboring compartments.

Reference-contexts: Their measurements suggested that the cell membrane at afferent synapses can be almost completely depolarized by normal visual stimulation. It is possible, therefore, that cortical cells could employ the kinds of saturation effects illustrated here, for example, to achieve frequency selectivity <ref> (Foster et al., 1985) </ref>. However, it must be emphasized that neurons possess a variety of membrane channels and intracellular mechanisms that confer highly non-linear response properties (Mel, 1994; Midtgaard, 1994), some of which enhance synaptic transmission, and some like, saturation, tending to depress it.
