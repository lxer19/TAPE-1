Abstract: My primary research interests lie in the broad areas of real-time and distributed systems with an emphasis on the practical application of research. More specifically, I am interested in the problem of resource allocation and sharing in distributed computing environments where applications have temporal constraints, such as real-time computer networks and multimedia systems. Since I started working in the computer industry, I have also been interested in software engineering methods for building complex systems. My dissertation topic, the synthesis of distributed real-time systems from processing graph, combines all of these areas. My research efforts to date have been driven by open problems that I have encountered in my consulting practice. In fact my dissertation topic originated with a Bell Labs research and development project involving signal processing applications developed with the U.S. Navy's Processing Graph Method (PGM) [18]. I was asked to create an on-line algorithm that would allocate these real-time applications to processors in a distributed network. Although the problem is NP-hard, I had hoped some simple heuristic techniques would provide a reasonable (albeit not optimal) solution. Unfortunately, I found that there did not even exist a framework from which I could analytically evaluate possible allocations. The state-of-the art was to simulate execution scenarios | an extremely time consuming and untenable option. Moreover, I found that there was no way to bound latency or memory requirements in the applications. Before I could evaluate heuristic allocation algorithms, a framework for evaluating processor demand, latency, and memory requirements of the applications was needed. This line of research is briefly described below. Processing graphs are a standard design aid in the development of complex digital signal processing systems. These directed graphs consist of nodes and graph edges depicting the flow of data from one node to the next. When sufficient data arrives, a node executes its function from start to finish in isolation (i.e., without synchronization). Processing graphs provide a natural description of signal processing applications with each node representing a mathematical function to be performed on a stream of data that flows on the arcs of the graph. The streams of input data are typically generated by sensors sampling the environment at periodic rates and sending the samples to the signal processor via an external channel. The processing graph methodology allows one to easily understand the signal processing performed by graphically depicting the structure of the algorithm. An important advantage of the graphical representation is that portions of the signal processing application (i.e., subgraphs) can be understood in the absence of the rest of the algorithm. Unfortunately, it is difficult to analyze the performance and processing requirements of applications developed with processing graph methodologies. In my experience with clients, the primary problem in developing embedded signal processing applications with a processing graph methodology is building a predictable real-time system in which one can determine if the graph "fits" on a processor. A graph "fits" on a processor if enough processing capacity is available to
