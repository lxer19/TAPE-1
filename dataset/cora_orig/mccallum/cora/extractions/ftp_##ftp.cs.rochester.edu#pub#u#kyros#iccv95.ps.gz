Abstract: We present an approach for building an affine representation of an unknown curved object viewed under orthographic projection from images of its occluding contour. It is based on the observation that the projection of a point on a curved, featureless surface can be computed along a special viewing direction that does not belong to the point's tangent plane. We show that by circumnavigating the object on the tangent plane of selected surface points, we can (1) compute two orthogonal projections of every point projecting to the occluding contour during this motion, and (2) compute the affine coordinates of these points. Our approach demonstrates that affine shape of curved objects can be computed directly, i.e., without Euclidean calibration or image velocity and acceleration measurements.

Reference-contexts: It is well-known that the deformation of the occluding contour uniquely determines surface shape. At issue is how to recover shape accurately. For example, previous methods measure the speeds and accelerations of image curves and relate them to the speeds and accelerations of the observer <ref> [11, 13-15] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We do this by (1) selecting a motion plane, (2) selecting an affine basis, and (3) circumnavigating the object on that plane so that the tangential and normal projections of all potential visible rim points can be determined. The motion plane and affine basis selection problems were studied in <ref> [12] </ref>: If four occluding contour points with parallel tangents can be identified in the image and the observer's motion plane is selected parallel to the points' tangents, those points define a valid affine basis.
