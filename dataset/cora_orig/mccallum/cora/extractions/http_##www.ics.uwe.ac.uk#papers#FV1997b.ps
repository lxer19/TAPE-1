Abstract: In the first part of the paper we describe a method which was designed for two industrial application projects concerned with load balancing problems in industry [Fogarty, Vavak 1995], [Vavak, Fogarty, Jukes 1995] with the aim of enabling a GA based on-line control system to track the optima of a system in which dynamics vary with time. Because of the direct evaluation of all individuals, an important consideration for the design of a tracking method was not only the off-line performance of the genetic algorithm (averaged performance of the best performing chromosomes so far - the best performing chromosome is selected for every population) [Goldberg 1989] but the on-line performance (averaged performance of all chromosomes evaluated so far) as well. Another important consideration was the quality of the worst members of the population, because direct evaluation of the weak individuals can have costly consequences in the real world applications. In the second part of the paper we show how integrating the tracking method with a simple exemplar-based incremental learning technique can further enhance performance of the designed tracking method. For simplicity, in the following text we will explain how the variable local search (VLS) operator works in detail on the 1-dimensional problem with a binary coded real integer variable. The VLS operator constitutes an adaptive tracking F. Vavak & K. Jukes Abstract In this paper we examine a modification to the genetic algorithm. The variable local search (VLS) operator was designed to enable the genetic algorithm based on-line optimisers to track optima of time-varying dynamic systems. This feature is not to the detriment of its ability to provide sound results for the stationary environments. The operator matches the level of diversity introduced into the population with the degree of the environmental change by increasing population diversity only gradually. The paper also shows that performance of the designed tracking method can be further enhanced by integrating it with a simple exemplar-based incremental learning technique. It is believed that the designed technique will prove beneficial in the application of the genetic algorithm based approaches to industrial control problems.
