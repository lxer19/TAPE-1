Abstract: We propose a hierarchical control architecture for dealing with faults and adverse environmental conditions on an Automated Highway System (AHS). Our design extends a previous control architecture that works under normal conditions of operation. The faults that are considered in our design are classified according to the capabilities remaining on the vehicle or roadside after the fault has occurred. Information about these capabilities is used by supervisors in each of the layers of the architecture to select appropriate control strategies. We outline the extended control strategies that are needed by these supervisors and, in certain cases, give examples of their detailed operation.

Reference-contexts: It also monitors incidents on the highway and diverts traffic away from them in order to minimize their impact on traffic flow and safety. A number of designs have been proposed for the link layer, that make use of "fluid" flow models <ref> [1, 6] </ref>, the concept of highway work [7] or the concept of highway space-time [8] to model the traffic. The coordination layer coordinates the operation of neighboring platoons. It receives the link layer commands and translates them to specific maneuvers that the platoons need to carry out. <p> In order to improve the resolution of the information and the commands, most proposed controller designs <ref> [1, 8] </ref> partition the highway into sections a few meters (of the order of 500) long and one lane wide. Entrance and exit lanes are also treated as separate sections. <p> The task of calculating the strategy is carried out by the link layer supervisor. It should be noted here that the description of the strategy need not be in terms of density and velocity profiles. Such profiles are better suited if traffic flow models, such as the ones in <ref> [1, 6] </ref>, are used. For activity and work based models (like the ones in [7, 8]) description in terms of a desired distribution of activities may be more suitable. <p> The AHS simulator SmartPath [21] has been successfully used in the past to carry out all these tasks for the normal mode <ref> [24, 1] </ref>. We are currently extending the capabilities of SmartPath to include operation under degraded conditions. Throughput Estimation: After proving the safety of the extended architecture, we need to estimate the performance (throughput, time delays) in the presence of faults.

Reference-contexts: faults in the design (e.g., a deadlock in the communication protocols) and in the implementation of the software, since we assume the design will be verified before being implemented. 2 2 Outline of Proposed Solution 2.1 Overview of Normal Mode Architecture Our framework builds on the control architecture proposed in <ref> [5] </ref> for normal operation. Before presenting the framework for fault handling and recovery, we give a brief overview of the normal mode design to fix the terminology and notation. The control hierarchy outlined in [5] centers around the notion of platooning. <p> Solution 2.1 Overview of Normal Mode Architecture Our framework builds on the control architecture proposed in <ref> [5] </ref> for normal operation. Before presenting the framework for fault handling and recovery, we give a brief overview of the normal mode design to fix the terminology and notation. The control hierarchy outlined in [5] centers around the notion of platooning. It is assumed that traffic on the highway is organized in groups of tightly spaced vehicles, called platoons. <p> Clearly implementation of such a scheme requires automatic vehicle control, as human drivers are not fast and reliable enough to produce the necessary inputs. In order to manage the complexity of the design process a hierarchical control scheme is proposed in <ref> [5] </ref>. The controller is organized in four layers (Figure 1). The top two layers, called network and link, reside on the roadside while the bottom two, called coordination and regulation reside on the vehicles 4 . <p> Our goal here is to produce such a fault tolerant control architecture. The new architecture will be a qualitative as well as quantitative extension of the normal mode architecture. Qualitatively, the degraded mode architecture maintains the hierarchical structure introduced in <ref> [5] </ref> but increases the autonomy of the system. This is achieved by adding to the design 4 the capability to detect faults, decide on a new control strategy and execute it. <p> The effect of environmental conditions on the system performance will be monitored by a hierarchical structure, called the performance monitor. 3.1 Capability Monitor The control scheme for normal operating conditions presented in <ref> [5] </ref> relies on a number of sensors, actuators and communication devices, both on the vehicles and on the roadside. All this additional hardware, as well as the standard mechanical parts of the vehicles, are prone 7 to failure. <p> It is intended for faults in the class "vehicle needs no assistance to exit". Normal: is the normal mode strategy defined by the normal mode AHS architecture of <ref> [5] </ref>. The strategy was implemented by means of finite state machines in [9]. 5.3 Coordination Layer Regulator The strategies described above are appropriate concatenations of atomic maneuvers. These include the normal mode maneuvers of [9] as well as some new, emergency maneuvers. <p> The goal of the 6 Concluding Remarks In this paper we proposed a framework for an AHS design that is capable of operating in the presence of faults and other factors that induce performance degradation. Our framework is hierarchical and builds on the control architecture of <ref> [5] </ref>. The design provides a high degree of autonomy by extending the information structure to include data about the system capability and the control structure to make a distinction between strategic planning and execution. The framework needs to be filled in with appropriate control laws.

The regulator should monitor the traffic in the link and use feedback to guarantee that the desired strategy is tracked by the closed loop system. One possible regulator design is presented in <ref> [6] </ref>. The design accepts 18 as inputs velocity and density profiles and issues velocity commands to the vehicles (both longitudinal and lateral). Asymptotic tracking of the desired profiles is proved by Lyapunov analysis, assuming a flow model for the traffic.

Therefore any normal mode maneuvers that may be in progress when an emergency maneuver is requested are aborted. <p> From past experience [14, 20, 24] it is clear that designing regulation layer control laws to satisfy such abstractions can be very challenging. In fact, [24] showed that even for normal operation undesirable behavior (high relative velocity collisions) can arise when combining a verified coordination layer design <ref> [9] </ref> with a set of individually satisfactory regulation layer controllers. In [22, 23] optimal control and game theoretical methods were used to analytically verify safety and reachability properties of the normal mode hybrid dynamical system.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the applicability of a regulation layer controller can be modeled by a predicate whose value depends on the values of the predicates for the physical layer. Consider, for example, the lead controller proposed in <ref> [14] </ref>. This longitudinal control law uses sensor readings of velocity and acceleration of the vehicle and of the spacing and relative velocity with respect to the preceding vehicle to calculate inputs for the throttle and brake actuators. <p> Figure 3 shows the map F R for the control designs in <ref> [12, 18, 14, 10, 15] </ref>. 3.1.3 Coordination Layer Predicates From the point of view of the coordination layer, the regulation layer control laws represent resources that can be used to carry out maneuvers.

Reference-contexts: Steps 2 and 3 are the main topic of this paper. For step 1, an exhaustive list of faults and other causes of performance degradation was compiled and can be found in <ref> [16] </ref>. For step 2, a framework for modeling the capability of the system in the presence of faults is given in Section 3. The fault classification (step 3) induced by our modeling framework is discussed in Section 4. <p> They include adverse weather conditions (such as rain, fog or snow) and gradual hardware degradation (such as brake ware). An extensive list of such causes, compiled by interviewing numerous PATH researchers, can be found in <ref> [16] </ref>. We will use C to denote the set of performance degradation causes. <p> C i can be thought of as a predicate that returns 1 if cause i is present and 0 if it is not. "Soft" approaches, such as fuzzy logic may be used to quantify more elusive causes, such as snow or fog. 7 A complete list can be found in <ref> [16] </ref>. 12 be noted that the performance parameters of higher layers will depend on those of lower lay-ers (e.g., the tracking errors depend on the acceleration bounds). However, there can be no loops in these dependencies, i.e. lower layer parameters do not depend on higher layer ones. <p> In this sense, the effects of gradual degradation and limits of robustness can be modeled as an extra term on the predicates. The overall process is shown in Figure 5. A more detailed discussion of this process can be found in <ref> [16] </ref>. There an exhaustive list of causes of performance degradation (compiled by interviewing a number of PATH researchers) is presented. A list of performance parameters is introduced and the effect of the causes on the parameters is specified, in most cases qualitatively.

Reference-contexts: We give a brief description of the proposed design and state the additional requirements that its implementation imposes on the physical layer. The details of the design, as well as verification results (Steps 4 and 6) can be found in <ref> [17] </ref>. 2.2 Hierarchical Structure For normal mode operation the complexity of the problem forced the designers to introduce a hierarchical controller. <p> New strategies are added both to the coordination supervisor and to the coordination regulator level in order to extend the design to faulted conditions 9 . Here we give a brief overview of a proposed degraded mode coordination layer controller. For more details see <ref> [17] </ref>. 5.2.1 Coordination Layer Supervisor Based on the fault classification introduced in Section 4, the extended coordination layer strategies can be separated into two classes. <p> During the execution of the degraded mode strategies, the faulty vehicle may request cooperation from neighboring vehicles. This cooperation can be encoded by means of communication protocols. In <ref> [17] </ref> the details of these protocols are specified in terms of interacting finite state machines. Here we only give a brief overview of the design. <p> Verification: After designing the control laws in this framework, the extended architecture has to be verified before implementation. Unfortunately there is no systematic way of verifying such hybrid systems at this time. The extended coordination layer control laws have been verified to be deadlock free, live and fair <ref> [17] </ref>. This discrete proof relies on simple abstractions of the continuous dynamics of the regulation and physical layer. This proof will suffice to guarantee safety if the continuous dynamics can be designed to obey the abstractions.

Reference-contexts: Without getting into the details of the control law, we can see that the lead controller predicate can be viewed as an AND of the predicates for the velocity, acceleration, spacing and relative velocity sensors and the brake and throttle actuators. Likewise, the law proposed in <ref> [18] </ref> for the followers in a platoon makes use of additional information about the state of the leader of the platoon.

The coordination layer of [9] requires that a normal vehicle should be able to enter the AHS, lead a platoon, join a platoon, be a follower, split from a platoon, change lane and exit the AHS. <p> We briefly describe the functional requirements of the extended regulation layer below. A detailed design of the extended regulation layer is a current research area. The normal mode regulation supervisor originally designed in <ref> [20] </ref>, is a finite state machine whose transitions depend upon the commands from the coordination layer, the readings of the sensors and the state of the continuous controllers. The degraded mode regulation supervisor will be required to play a similar role. <p> This discrete proof relies on simple abstractions of the continuous dynamics of the regulation and physical layer.

From past experience <ref> [14, 20, 24] </ref> it is clear that designing regulation layer control laws to satisfy such abstractions can be very challenging.

The regulator level contains protocols for coordinating individual maneuvers with neighboring vehicles. <p> Finally, Monte Carlo simulations of the overall fault tolerant system can be used to obtain estimates of the impact of the degraded mode controllers on the highway throughput and hence validate any theoretical models developed for this purpose. The AHS simulator SmartPath <ref> [21] </ref> has been successfully used in the past to carry out all these tasks for the normal mode [24, 1]. We are currently extending the capabilities of SmartPath to include operation under degraded conditions.

Reference-contexts: This kind of interaction is an example of how communication can be used to introduce cooperation between the vehicles. While in normal mode neighboring vehicles can be viewed as malicious opponents in designing safe vehicle following and maneuver execution controllers <ref> [22, 23] </ref>, in degraded modes their actions are "controlled" by the faulty vehicle through communication, therefore their role is assisting. The price to pay for this convenience of course is the substantial increase in the design complexity. <p> In fact, [24] showed that even for normal operation undesirable behavior (high relative velocity collisions) can arise when combining a verified coordination layer design [9] with a set of individually satisfactory regulation layer controllers. In <ref> [22, 23] </ref> optimal control and game theoretical methods were used to analytically verify safety and reachability properties of the normal mode hybrid dynamical system.

Reference-contexts: This discrete proof relies on simple abstractions of the continuous dynamics of the regulation and physical layer. This proof will suffice to guarantee safety if the continuous dynamics can be designed to obey the abstractions. From past experience <ref> [14, 20, 24] </ref> it is clear that designing regulation layer control laws to satisfy such abstractions can be very challenging. <p> This proof will suffice to guarantee safety if the continuous dynamics can be designed to obey the abstractions.

Throughput Estimation: After proving the safety of the extended architecture, we need to estimate the performance (throughput, time delays) in the presence of faults.
