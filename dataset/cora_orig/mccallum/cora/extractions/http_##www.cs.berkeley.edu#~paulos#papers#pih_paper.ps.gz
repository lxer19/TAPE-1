Title: Accurate Insertion Strategies Using Simple Optical Sensors  
Author: Eric Paulos John Canny

Abstract: Peg-in-hole insertion is not only a longstanding problem in robotics but the most common automated mechanical assembly task [10]. In this paper we present a high precision, self-calibrating peg-in-hole insertion strategy using several very simple, inexpensive, and accurate optical sensors. The self-calibrating feature allows us to achieve successful dead-reckoning insertions with tolerances of 25 microns without any accurate initial position information for the robot, pegs, or holes. The program we implemented works for any cylindrical peg, and the sensing steps do not depend on the peg diameter, which the program does not know. The key to the strategy is the use of a fixed sensor to localize both a mobile sensor and the peg, while the mobile sensor localizes the hole. Our strategy is extremely fast, localizing pegs as they are en route to their insertion location without pausing. The result is that insertion times are dominated by the transport time between pick and place operations.

Reference-contexts: Once on the VME bus, the robot controller can then read the sensor values. 4.2 Robot Hardware and Control We implemented our peg-in-hole system at U.C. Berkeley on the RobotWorld robot <ref> [1] </ref> depicted in Figure 7. This robot consists of several Sawyer motor modules magnetically attached to an 0:8 fi 1:3 meter rectangular steel platen and separated from the platen by an air bearing, thus allowing planar motion with low friction.

Reference-contexts: All of this is done without the need to pause over the sensor. Other applications of these sensors in the broader setting of RISC robotics are presented in work by Canny and Goldberg <ref> [4] </ref>. In addition we have implemented this method and demonstrated it to be highly reliable for any locally accurate ( 5 cm) robot. Typical calibration methods in use today involve special robot actions and costly calculations, resulting in a reduction of the throughput for the entire assembly system. <p> Beam sensors can be used to do recognition as well as localization, as described by Wallack, Canny, and Manocha [16]. In the future we plan to combine that work with the present, to produce a general precision insertion algorithm for arbitrary parts. 2 RISC Robotics RISC robotics <ref> [4] </ref> (Reduced Intricacy in Sensing and Control) is an attempt to fuse automation and robotics technologies. The RISC acronym, borrowed from computer architecture, suggests the parallels between the two technologies. RISC robotics performs complex manufacturing operations by composing simple elements. RISC robotics can be applied to many areas of manufacturing.

Reference-contexts: However, the construction of powerful general purpose assembly tools using only a small number of simple optical sensors coupled with intelligent algorithms has not been exploited. Optical sensing has been used for calibration since 1988 by Everett and Ives <ref> [7] </ref>. Their approach uses optical sensors and special precision spheres to perform calibrations. They mount these spheres onto a special calibration block, calibrate the robot's position, and then remove the block.

Reference-contexts: Compliance based on the Remote Center of Compli--ance (RCC) was introduced by Whitney [17] and later developed by Peshkin [12]. RCCs are somewhat specialized though, and active compliance has been studied as a way to deal with a variety of assembly scenarios, in particular by Khatib <ref> [8] </ref>. Our work complements this previous work by extending the number of assembly tasks that can be performed without the need for compliance. Our dead-reckoning strategy is as fast as RCC insertion, and as flexible as active strategies.

Reference-contexts: In this system, compliance, a highly desired property of RCC peg-in-hole systems, is traded for high positional accuracy. All robot control and sensing are performed by Talisker <ref> [11] </ref>, a multi-threaded, real-time robot control system developed by Ed Nicolson et al. at U.C. Berke-ley. Talisker currently executes on a 68040 microprocessor with a VME backplane. 5 Results We performed repeated insertion tests of our peg-in-hole strategy using pegs and holes of various diameters both with and without chamfers.

Reference-contexts: They mount these spheres onto a special calibration block, calibrate the robot's position, and then remove the block. Their off-line calibration scheme is reported to be repeatable to 58 microns, while our online insertion system is repeatable to 25 microns. Work in 1993 by Prenninger et al. <ref> [13] </ref> uses a laser optical system for calibration. They use a laser/mirror system to triangulate the position of the end-effector of a robot. Their system is quite complex, involving a laser, a mirror mounted on the end-effector, a high precision universal joint, and a CCD vision system.
