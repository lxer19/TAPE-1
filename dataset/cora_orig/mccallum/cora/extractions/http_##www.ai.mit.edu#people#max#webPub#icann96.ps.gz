Abstract: We present a method for calculating phase diagrams for the high-dimensional variant of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM). The method requires only an ansatz for the tesselation of the data space induced by the map, not for the explicit state of the map. Using this method we analyze two recently proposed models for the development of orientation and ocular dominance column maps. The phase transition condition for the orientation map turns out to be of different form than of the corresponding low-dimensional map.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The high-dimensional self-organizing map (SOM) and the low-dimensional self-organizing feature (SOFM) map have been used to model a variety of self-organizational paradigms in the brain and in technical applications <ref> [1] </ref>. In both variants stimuli from an input space are mapped to a lattice of output elements (neurons), each characterized by a position r in the lattice plus a receptive field w r .

Reference-contexts: A stimulus v is mapped onto that neuron s whose receptive field w s matches v best. This amounts to a winner-take-all rule, i.e. a strong lateral nonlinearity. In the SOM (as well as in previous <ref> [2] </ref> or more recent [3] formulations of map formation processes) stimuli are normalized patterns of activity in a high-dimensional space (eg. images on a discretized retina).

A formation of receptive field shapes without prior parametrization of receptive field properties cannot be achieved in feature map approximation but only in the high-dimensional SOM variant.

Reference-contexts: Using ellipsoidal Gaussian activity distributions as stimuli (minor axis 1 , major axis 2 &gt; 1 ), simulations of this model led to maps with orientation preference for substantially elongated stimuli <ref> [4] </ref>. Using rather circular stimuli ( 2 1 ) maps with neurons of no orientation preference were also observed [8]. To simplify calculations we restrict the number of stimulus orientations to two (horizontal and vertical), and the possible stimulus centers to the retinal channels (see Fig. 2).

Reference-contexts: A great advantage of this new distortion measure lies in the fact that the r - ansatz necessary for an evaluation of Eq. (5) is comparatively easy to make (see following examples). A more detailed account of this method can be found in forthcoming publications <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. 3 Results Using Eq. (5), we now analyze two SOM-models for the development of visual maps, one for the development of orientation maps, in which the emergence of oriented receptive fields is contingent upon the presence of oriented stimuli, and one for the development of ocular dominance maps.

Reference-contexts: By Eq. (2 and depends on the w r in an implicit way). Under quite general assumptions, the minima of E v coincide with those of the naive "energy function" for the SOM-model <ref> [7] </ref> in the limit of ! 0, and the deviations are small otherwise.

Reference-contexts: Now, the neuron depicted in c (and a) is the winner. 2 Evaluating tesselations of data sets So far, a mathematical analysis of SOM map development process has only been achieved for the feature map variant <ref> [9] </ref> but not for the high-dimensional SOMs. Here, we propose to make an ansatz for plausible states of the map, to evaluate a distortion function for these states and to determine the state of lowest distortion. <p> The additive relation between 1 and 2;crit deviates from the multiplicative relation found for a corresponding SOFM <ref> [9] </ref>. function of 1 , for two exemplary values of the map neighborhood function width .

Reference-contexts: For decreasing values of c, the preferred solution changes from no ocular dominance, via solutions with increasing band width, to the degenerate type e solution with only two OD bands. This transition scenario coincides with the findings of a recent neuroanatomical experiment <ref> [12] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Here we consider the following arrangements: a chequerboard-type alternation (type b), or bands of length N in one direction, and widths 1 (c), 2 (d), or N=2 (e) in the orthogonal direction. Type e corresponds to a degenerate solution, which can be found in models <ref> [13] </ref>, but not in the visual cortex. Evaluating the distortions E v for the different tesselations, we obtain the phase diagram depicted in Fig. 3a.

Reference-contexts: We here report that our above-described method allowed us to calculate the regime of stimulus and map parameters for the On-center- Off-center-cell competition problem. In subsequent simulations we then obtained maps with oriented receptive fields <ref> [14] </ref>.
