Abstract: This paper describes several aspects of our ongoing research relating to technologies and techniques for collaborative learning. Our research is focused on the classroom-in-the-round, a CSCW enabled classroom that attempts to promote collaborative learning through novel room design, hardware, software and courseware. Encouraging preliminary feedback from courses we are teaching in the classroom is presented. An in-depth study conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of assigned roles on collaboration between pairs of users in a synchronous groupware simulation is then discussed. Statistically significant results show that assigned roles increase team interaction and improve group performance in subsequent unrelated group activities, when compared to a control group. The paper closes with some remarks on promising instructional techniques we are investigating for collaborative learning, including distributed grading, online presentation of team projects, and team-oriented presentationstyle exams.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Intellectual teamwork, in which student teams share knowledge and collaborate on projects and assignments, has emerged as a major instructional technique at many colleges and universities. To foster intellectual teamwork, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has initiated studio format classes that stress technological support for instruction and student collaboration <ref> [1] </ref>. In addition to several technology-enhanced classrooms with workstations and advanced projection systems, a unique, conference-style facility known as the classroom-in-the-round", illustrated in Figure 2, features a novel circular room design coupled with special furniture, hardware, software and courseware intended to enhance collaboration [2,3].

Reference-contexts: One version of the simulation used assigned roles, while the other (the control) did not. Participants were grouped into pairs, with each pair using one version of CollabBillboard. When the simulation was completed, participants worked through a classic paper and pencil collaborative exercise called Lost At Sea <ref> [4] </ref>. At the end of the experiment, the pair were asked to complete a survey about their experiences. Pairs of participants were scheduled for a one hour session.

Reference-contexts: This is used to calculate v, the effective number of degrees of freedom, which takes the sample sizes of both groups into account. Finally, a confidence interval is computed. If the interval spans zero, the mean difference between the groups is not considered statistically significant <ref> [5] </ref>. Statistically significant mean differences were marked as potentially interesting. Other measurements whose mean differences were not significant were also marked if they seemed relevant to collaboration. An interpretation of the results was then performed.

Reference-contexts: Discussion We know of no other work that has been done to evaluate collaboration with roles in synchronous groupware, although we are aware of a number of CSCW systems that advocate and include role functionality. Quilt <ref> [6] </ref> is a collaborative document system that allows users to take on various roles (e.g. writer, commenter, reviewer) during the editing process. These roles restrict read/write access to the document.

Reference-contexts: Although these systems advocate roles as a powerful collaborative tool, we are not aware of any formal evaluation of the approachs efficacy. SharedARK is a system for creating synchronous, shared microworlds <ref> [12] </ref>. A SharedARK microworld is an infinite, shared, two-dimensional flatland with a small portion visible on any one computer display. Users manipulate objects using a special mouse driven hand. The system can operate in faceto-face and distance environments. <p> Experiments with SharedARK systems have shown that students are more engaged and perform deeper evaluations of problem sets than they do with paper and pencil exercises <ref> [12] </ref>. TurboTurtle [15] is a system for exploring Newtonian physics, similar to SharedARK. A distinguishing feature of the system is its sophisticated support for awareness of other users including user lists, telepointers, and shared widget controls.

Reference-contexts: When users encounter each other in SharedARK they can set up audio/video links. A basic model of the physical world is built into the system. Users can experiment and create objects that have mass, density, and momentum. Several applications have been created including the Puckland <ref> [13] </ref> simulator for elastic collisions and ARKCola [14], a simulation of a soft drink processing plant. Experiments with SharedARK systems have shown that students are more engaged and perform deeper evaluations of problem sets than they do with paper and pencil exercises [12].

Reference-contexts: The individual problems, on the other hand, serve as explicitly divided collaborative exercises, in the sense that each individual is assigned specific problems but students are permitted (indeed, encouraged) to share information and collaboratively work on refining their unified submission. Team projects are submitted as online HTML presentations. WebCT <ref> [16] </ref> is used to provide the students with tools for uploading and designing their presentations. Netscape Composer and Microsoft Word serve as the primary web authoring tools. We find online presentations useful, because they allow students to study and analyze each others work.
