Abstract: First we define and study the exponentiation of a cellular algebra by a permutation group which is analogous to the corresponding operation (the wreath product in primitive action) in permutation group theory. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the resulting cellular algebra to be primitive and Schurian are given. This enables us to construct infinite series of primitive non-Schurian algebras. Also we define and study for cellular algebras the notion of a base which is similar to that for permutation groups. We present an upper bound for the size of an irredundant base of a primitive cellular algebra in terms of the parameters of its standard representation. This produces new upper bounds for the order of the automorphism group of such an algebra and in particular for the order of a primitive permutation group. Finally we generalize to 2-closed primitive algebras some classical theorems for primitive groups and show that the hypothesis for a primitive algebra to be 2-closed is essential.

Reference-contexts: We call this base irredundant if fv i g 62 Cel (W v 1 ;:::;v i1 ) for all i 2 <ref> [1; b] </ref>. Otherwise it is called redundant. A subset B of V is called a base of W if W [B] = Mat V . In this section the term "base" always means ordered base. The minimum size of a base of W is denoted by b (W ). <p> Schurian where b = b (W ). (In fact, the split number of W defined in that paper coincides with b.) We also mention the upper bound b O ( p n log n) for a primitive cellular algebra W not coinciding with the simplex S (V ) proved in <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> We will prove that the sum L k = i=1 is direct for k 2 [0; b]. It suffices to verify that W P v k " L k1 = f0g for all k 2 <ref> [1; b] </ref>. Let Av k 2 L k1 for some A 2 W P . Then the choice of B guarantees by lemma 4.7 that the relation Eq (A) is different from the diagonal of V fi V . <p> This implies that there exists an irredundant base B = (v 1 ; : : : ; v b ) such that v i+1 2 V n X i and R T (v i+1 ) " X i 6= ; for all i 2 <ref> [1; b 1] </ref>. It follows that [G v 1 ;:::;v i : G v 1 ;:::;v i+1 ] d; i 2 [1; b 1] where G = Aut (W ). Since [G : G v 1 ] n, the theorem follows. <p> : ; v b ) such that v i+1 2 V n X i and R T (v i+1 ) " X i 6= ; for all i 2 <ref> [1; b 1] </ref>. It follows that [G v 1 ;:::;v i : G v 1 ;:::;v i+1 ] d; i 2 [1; b 1] where G = Aut (W ). Since [G : G v 1 ] n, the theorem follows. <p> Proposition 5.1 ([4]) For each cellular algebra W on V the following statements hold: (1) Aut (W (m) ) = Aut (W ) for all m 1; (3) (W (m) ) (l) = W (m) for all l 2 <ref> [1; m] </ref>. Thus in a sense W (m) can be viewed as an approximation to Sch (W ). 5.2 Below we restrict ourselves to the case m = 2. <p> To see that the hypothesis for W to be 2-closed is essential let us consider the non-Schurian primitive cellular algebra W = T (15) on V = <ref> [1; 15] </ref> defined in subsection 2.2.

Reference-contexts: One of our goals here is to present a connection between the structure properties of W and the representation parameters of ae such as its irreducible representation multiplicities and degrees. It should be mentioned that our approach is different from that of <ref> [2] </ref> where commutative cellular algebras arising from distance regular graphs have been studied. <p> algebra theory there was a conjecture that each cellular algebra W is Schurian (see [7] for the explanation of the term), i.e. that the following equality holds: W = Z (Aut (W )): (1) If it was so, then we would have a complete characterization of distance regular graphs (see <ref> [2] </ref>) and a polynomial-time algorithm for the Graph Isomorphism Problem (see [11]). However this is not the case and some examples of non-Schurian cellular algebras can be 2 found in [13] and [7]. This leads to the following problem (Schurity problem): determine whether a given cellular algebra is Schurian.

Reference-contexts: A famous Sims conjecture proved in <ref> [3] </ref> under the classification of finite simple groups (CFSG) states that jGj nf (d) where G Sym (V ) is a primitive permutation group and d is the minimum subdegree of G (coinciding with d min of Z (G)).

Reference-contexts: These theorems enable us to construct infinite series of non-Schurian primitive algebras (see the end of subsection 3.3). In section 4 we define for cellular algebras the notion of a base which is similar to that for permutation groups. It is closely related to the Schurity problem: according to <ref> [4] </ref> an m-closed cellular algebra having a base of size m 1 is Schurian (as to the discussion of higher closed algebras see below). <p> Note that each of these results gives rise to the corresponding result for primitive permutation groups. In section 5 we continue the investigation of the m-closure of a cellular algebra introduced in <ref> [4] </ref> (the exact definition of m-closure can also be found in this section). It can be considered as an approximation of a cellular algebra W on V to the Schurian closure Sch (W ) = Z (Aut (W )) of it (see [4]): W = W (1) : : : W <p> the m-closure of a cellular algebra introduced in <ref> [4] </ref> (the exact definition of m-closure can also be found in this section). It can be considered as an approximation of a cellular algebra W on V to the Schurian closure Sch (W ) = Z (Aut (W )) of it (see [4]): W = W (1) : : : W (n) = Sch (W ) where W (m) is the m-closure of W and n is the cardinality of V . <p> Using the notions of a base and a higher closure (see section 5) we can give a sufficient condition for a cellular algebra to be Schurian. Namely, it was proved in <ref> [4] </ref> that (b + 1)-closure of a cellular algebra W is Schurian where b = b (W ). (In fact, the split number of W defined in that paper coincides with b.) We also mention the upper bound b O ( p n log n) for a primitive cellular algebra W <p> By theorems 4.10 and 4.3 this shows that j Aut (W )j n 2 O (m 2 still uniformly for all such P . 13 5 Two-closed primitive cellular algebras 5.1 The notion of a m-closed cellular algebra was inroduced in <ref> [4] </ref> in connection with the Schurity problem. It goes back to [11] where a similar notion was defined in an algorithmic way. We start with the main definitions concerning higher closed cellular algebras. Let W be a cellular algebra on V . <p> Set W (m) = (( c W (m) ) ) 1 We call W (m) the m-closure of W and say that W is m-closed if W = W (m) . Each cellular algebra is certainly 1-closed. However it is not the case for m 2 (see <ref> [4] </ref>). The following proposition describes the relationship between the m-closures and the Schurian closure Sch (W ) = Z (Aut (W )) of a cellular algebra W . Proposition 5.1 ([4]) For each cellular algebra W on V the following statements hold: (1) Aut (W (m) ) = Aut (W ) <p> We need a statement on the structure of 2-extended algebras which is a consequence of proposition 3.6 and lemmas 2.5 and 3.1 of <ref> [4] </ref>. Lemma 5.2 Let W be a cellular algebra on V . <p> Suppose that d (R) = d (S) for all nonreflexive basis relations R; S of W . Then either W is primitive or each irredundant base of W is of size at most 2. Remark 5.10 It follows from theorem 1.3 of <ref> [4] </ref> that in the second case the algebra W is Schurian provided that it is 3-closed. Proof. Let W be an imprimitive cellular algebra with R as the set of basis relations, E be an equivalence of W and U 2 V =E.

Reference-contexts: Then W has an irredundant base of size 4 whereas m P =n P = 3 for its idempotent P of degree 2 and multiplicity 6. Proof. We start with two lemmas proved in <ref> [5] </ref>. To make the paper selfcontained we give the complete proofs of them. Lemma 4.6 Let W be a cellular algebra on V .

Reference-contexts: Let now W be a homogeneous cellular algebra. As it was shown in <ref> [6] </ref> the following inequality holds: n P m P ; P 2 Spec (W ): (10) Moreover, n P = m P for all P iff W is regular. 9 Lemma 4.1 Let W Mat V be a homogeneous cellular algebra. <p> It would be interesting to estimate d av by a function of d min , which would give a new proof of the Sims conjecture without assuming the CFSG. We complete the section by mentioning that according to theorem 4.2 of <ref> [6] </ref> the inequality d min 2 O (m P ) holds uniformly for all nonprincipal idempotent P 2 Spec (W ) of a primitive cellular algebra W .

Reference-contexts: At the beginning of the development of cellular algebra theory there was a conjecture that each cellular algebra W is Schurian (see <ref> [7] </ref> for the explanation of the term), i.e. that the following equality holds: W = Z (Aut (W )): (1) If it was so, then we would have a complete characterization of distance regular graphs (see [2]) and a polynomial-time algorithm for the Graph Isomorphism Problem (see [11]). <p> However this is not the case and some examples of non-Schurian cellular algebras can be 2 found in [13] and <ref> [7] </ref>. This leads to the following problem (Schurity problem): determine whether a given cellular algebra is Schurian. The Schurity problem is the second topic of our paper. The combinatorial features of cellular algebras are based on the fact that the last are closed with respect to the Hadamard multiplication. <p> In section 3 we define a new operation, the exponentiation of a cellular algebra W by a permutation group K, the result of which is a cellular algebra W " K. It is similar to the corresponding operation for permutation groups (see <ref> [7] </ref>). It is known that the exponentiation G " K of permutation groups G and K is primitive iff G is primitive and nonregular and K is transitive. <p> We note that semiregular cellular algebras are Schurian. It follows from [13] that there exist cellular algebras which are not Schurian (see also <ref> [7] </ref>). The smallest example of a non-Schurian cellular algebra which we know is the commutative algebra T (15) on 15 points corresponding to the skew Hadamard matrix of order 16 (see [7] for the explicit description). <p> It follows from [13] that there exist cellular algebras which are not Schurian (see also <ref> [7] </ref>). The smallest example of a non-Schurian cellular algebra which we know is the commutative algebra T (15) on 15 points corresponding to the skew Hadamard matrix of order 16 (see [7] for the explicit description). This algebra has three basis relations whose degrees are 1, 7, 7 and is primitive in the sense of subsection 2.3. Along with the notion of an isomorphism we consider for cellular algebras that of a weak one. <p> 1 ; K 2 ; K are permutation groups and (resp. o) denotes the direct sum (resp. the wreath product in imprimitive action) of permutation groups. 3.2 The above operation is closely related to the exponentiation of permutation groups called also the wreath product in primitive action (see for instance <ref> [7] </ref>). <p> The first inclusion is straightforward. To check the second one we note that Aut (S (V ) " Sym (X)) = Sym (V ) " Sym (X) (the both groups clearly have the same 2-orbits and the second one is 2-closed, see <ref> [7] </ref>). Then each permutation from Aut (W " K) is of the form oe = (fg x g; k), g x 2 Sym (V ), k 2 K.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction There are at least three mathematical environments carring in a natural way into cellular (coherent) algebras introduced by Weisfeiler and Lehman and independently by Higman (see [11], <ref> [8] </ref>).

Finally, there is a cellular algebra approach to the Graph Isomorphism Problem which is one of the most well-known unsolved problems in computational complexity theory. The cornerstone of this approach consists in associating to a graph the smallest cellular algebra containing its adjacency matrix. <p> By (2) the set of all of them form a partition of V fi V which can be interpreted as a coherent configuration on V (see <ref> [8] </ref>). We often use for this set the same notation R and save for basis relations all the notations introduced for basis matrices. 2.2 A large class of cellular algebras comes from permutation groups as follows (see [11]).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction There are at least three mathematical environments carring in a natural way into cellular (coherent) algebras introduced by Weisfeiler and Lehman and independently by Higman (see <ref> [11] </ref>, [8]). These are by definition matrix algebras over C closed under the Hadamard multiplication and the Hermitian conjugation and containing the identity matrix and the all one matrix. <p> The cornerstone of this approach consists in associating to a graph the smallest cellular algebra containing its adjacency matrix. There is a canonical polynomial-time procedure for this which reduces the Graph Isomorphism Problem to the corresponding problem for cellular algebras (see <ref> [11] </ref>). One of the advantages in studying cellular algebras consists in the following observation: on one hand the axioms defining them are less restrictive than those of groups and on the other hand they are not so amorphic objects as graphs. <p> is Schurian (see [7] for the explanation of the term), i.e. that the following equality holds: W = Z (Aut (W )): (1) If it was so, then we would have a complete characterization of distance regular graphs (see [2]) and a polynomial-time algorithm for the Graph Isomorphism Problem (see <ref> [11] </ref>). However this is not the case and some examples of non-Schurian cellular algebras can be 2 found in [13] and [7]. This leads to the following problem (Schurity problem): determine whether a given cellular algebra is Schurian. The Schurity problem is the second topic of our paper. <p> For integers l; m with l m by [l; m] we denote the set fl; l + 1; : : : ; mg. 2 Cellular algebras All undefined below terms concerning cellular algebras and permutation groups can be found in <ref> [11] </ref> and [13] respectively. 2.1 By a cellular algebra on V we mean a subalgebra W of Mat V for which the following conditions are satisfied: (C1) I V ; J V 2 W ; (C3) 8A; B 2 W : A ffi B 2 W , where A ffi B <p> We often use for this set the same notation R and save for basis relations all the notations introduced for basis matrices. 2.2 A large class of cellular algebras comes from permutation groups as follows (see <ref> [11] </ref>). Let G Sym (V ) be a permutation group and Z (G) = fA 2 Mat V : A g = A; g 2 Gg be its centralizer algebra. Then Z (G) is a cellular algebra on V . Its basis relations are exactly the 2-orbits of G. <p> Lemma 2.1 (<ref> [11] </ref>) Let W be a primitive cellular algebra having a nonreflexive basis relation of degree 1. Then W = Z (Z p ) where Z p is a regular permutation group on p points, p being a prime. If W is primitive, then according to [11] each nonreflexive basis relation of W is strongly connected (in the corresponding graph any two vertices are connected by a directed path). <p> It goes back to <ref> [11] </ref> where a similar notion was defined in an algorithmic way. We start with the main definitions concerning higher closed cellular algebras. Let W be a cellular algebra on V . <p> The following statement is a generalization of this result to cellular algebras (see also <ref> [11] </ref>). Theorem 5.9 Let W be a 2-closed homogeneous cellular algebra on V . Suppose that d (R) = d (S) for all nonreflexive basis relations R; S of W . Then either W is primitive or each irredundant base of W is of size at most 2. <p> So GCD (d; jU j) = 1: (19) For v 2 V set S = S (v; U ) = fS 2 R : S (v) " U 6= ;g. Then the sets S (v; U ) for different U either coincide or disjoint (see <ref> [11] </ref>). So the set [ S2S S (v) is the union of classes of E and hence djSj = X d (S) = jU jl for some positive integer l. It follows from (19) that jU j divides S. Since jSj jU j, we conclude that jSj = jU j.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, L b ae P C V and dim (P C V ) = m P n P . Thus the direct decomposition (14) with k = b gives the inequality bn 2 which completes the proof. According to <ref> [12] </ref> the enveloping algebra Env (G) of a permutation group G coincides with the commutator algebra of Z (G) and vice versa. Moreover, Spec (Env (G)) = Spec (Z (G)).

Reference-contexts: The first environment is permutation group theory where a cellular algebra arises as the centralizer algebra Z (G) of a permutation group G (see chapter 5 of <ref> [13] </ref>). Another field is algebraic combinatorics, especially the association scheme and design theories. All objects in this context can be considered as special cases of coherent configurations and cellular algebras arise as the adjacency algebras of them (see [8]). <p> However this is not the case and some examples of non-Schurian cellular algebras can be 2 found in <ref> [13] </ref> and [7]. This leads to the following problem (Schurity problem): determine whether a given cellular algebra is Schurian.

We note that semiregular cellular algebras are Schurian. It follows from <ref> [13] </ref> that there exist cellular algebras which are not Schurian (see also [7]). The smallest example of a non-Schurian cellular algebra which we know is the commutative algebra T (15) on 15 points corresponding to the skew Hadamard matrix of order 16 (see [7] for the explicit description). <p> At the end of the subsection we give an example which shows that the hypothesis for a primitive algebra to be 2-closed is essential. We begin with the following characterization of 2-closed primitive algebras (cf. theorem 8.2 of <ref> [13] </ref>). Theorem 5.5 Let W be a 2-closed homogeneous cellular algebra on V . Then W is primitive iff the algebra W v is a minimal cellular overalgebra of W for all v 2 V . Proof. <p> Thus the equivalence E satisfies the hypothesis of corollary 5.4. So U 2 Cel (W [I U ]) which implies that jU j = 1. This shows that the equivalence E is trivial. Another statement generalizes proposition 8.7 of <ref> [13] </ref>. Theorem 5.6 Let W be a 2-closed primitive cellular algebra on V and u; v be different points of V . Then W = W u " W v unless W = Z (Z p ) for a prime p. Proof. <p> Since W is 2-closed, it follows from lemma 5.3 that the basis relation R of W for which v 2 R (u) is of degree 1. So W = Z (Z p ) by lemma 2.1. The following theorem generalizes theorem 17.6 of <ref> [13] </ref> on the faithful constituents of a one-point stabilizer of a primitive permutation group. Theorem 5.7 Let W be a 2-closed primitive cellular algebra on V . <p> It can be shown in a similar way that for the algebra W the conclusions of theorems 5.6 and 5.7 are also false. 17 5.4 It is well-known that each 3/2-transitive permutation group is either primitive or a Frobenius group (see theorem 10.4 in <ref> [13] </ref>). The following statement is a generalization of this result to cellular algebras (see also [11]). Theorem 5.9 Let W be a 2-closed homogeneous cellular algebra on V . Suppose that d (R) = d (S) for all nonreflexive basis relations R; S of W .
