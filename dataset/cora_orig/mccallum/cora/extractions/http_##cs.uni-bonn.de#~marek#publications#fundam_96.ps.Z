Abstract: We prove for the first time an existence of the short (polynomial size) proofs for nondivisibility of two sparse polynomials (putting thus this problem is the class NP) under the Extended Riemann Hypothesis. The divisibility problem is closely related to the problem of rational interpolation. Its computational complexity was studied in [GKS 90], [GK 91], and [GKS 92]. We prove also, somewhat surprisingly, the problem of deciding whether a rational function given by a black box equals to a polynomial belong to the parallel class NC (see, e. g., [KR 90]), provided we know the degree of its sparse representation. fl A preliminary version of this paper appeared in Proc. ACM ISAAC (1992), Berkeley, pp. 117-122.

Reference-contexts: Riemann Hypothesis holds. 3 Divisibility problem for sparse rational function given by a black box The Theorem 1 can be improved if t-sparse f , g 2 Z [X 1 ; : : : ; X n ] are not ex-plicitely given, but we have a black box (see e.g. <ref> [GK 91, GKS 90] </ref>) for the rational function f =g provided that lc X 1 (g) = 1, i.e. g = X m 1 + 0im1 1 where the polynomials g i 2 Z [X 2 ; : : : ; X n ], and a bound on d is given. <p> This is due to the fact that in the one-variable case we need only a bound on M which one can compute by the parallel NC-algorithm from a black box relying on the construction from <ref> [GK 91] </ref>. (We refer to [KR 88] for the definition of the parallel NC-class.) To do this we proceed as follows. <p> Then the algorithm constructs an integer N 0 &gt; 36 2 3M d 5 . Finally, the algorithm yields the number N = q (q (N 0 )). We claim that N is big enough (see <ref> [GK 91] </ref>), namely, divide with the remainder f = eg + rem (f; g), then for each integer N 1 N we have 0 &lt; j rem (f;g) g (N 1 )j &lt; 1 2 , provided that rem (f; g) 6= 0. Let us prove the claim.
