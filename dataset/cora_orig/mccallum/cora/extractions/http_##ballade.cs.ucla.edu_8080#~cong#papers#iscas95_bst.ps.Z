Title: Minimum-Cost Bounded-Skew Clock Routing

Affiliation: UCLA Computer Science Department  
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new clock routing algorithm which minimizes total wirelength under any given path-length skew bound. The algorithm constructs a bounded-skew tree (BST) in two steps: (i) a bottom-up phase to construct a binary tree of shortest-distance feasible regions which represent the loci of possible placements of clock entry points, and (ii) a top-down phase to determine the exact locations of clock entry points. Experimental results show that our clock routing algorithm, named BST/DME, can produce a set of routing solutions with skew and wirelength trade-off.

The boundary of the region is defined by octilinear line segments, i.e. they are either Manhattan arcs (line segments with slope 1 <ref> [2] </ref>), or horizontal line segments or vertical line segments. Path-Length Property: For any two points p and q on the same Manhattan arc on the boundary of a SDFR, SP L (p) = SP L (q) and LP L (p) = LP L (q). <p> Table 1 compares the ZST routing costs by the NN (Nearest Neighbor) algorithm from [7] with the routing costs of our BST/DME algorithm for different skew bounds. The reason that we only compare with [7] is because it outperforms other clock routing algorithms including <ref> [2, 6, 17] </ref>. Note that the NN algorithm can be improved slightly using the MD and ME algorithms in [7]. Moreover, [8] showed that wirelength can be further reduced by changing the topology after an initial topology is obtained. We are currently incorporating these enhancements in our BST/DME algorithm.
