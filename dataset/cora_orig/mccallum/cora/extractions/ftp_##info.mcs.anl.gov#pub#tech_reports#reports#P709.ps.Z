Abstract: In 1993, Sidi introduced a set of trigonometric transformations, x = (t) that improve the effectiveness of the one-dimensional trapezoidal quadrature rule for a finite interval. In this paper, we extend Sidi's approach to product multidimensional quadrature over [0; 1] N . We establish the Euler-Maclaurin expansion for this rule, both in the case of a regular integrand function f(x) and in the cases when f(x) has homogeneous singularities confined to vertices.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction and Outline Elementary transformations, helpful in integrating f (x) over a finite interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, include some of the form x = (t), where (0) = 0 (1) = 1 0 (t) &gt; 0 8 t 2 (0; 1): (1:1) This transforms an integrand as follows: If = 0 Z 1 f ( (t)) 0 (t)dt = IF; (1:2) where F (t) = f <p> This situation occurs when (t) is chosen so that 0 (t) is relatively "flat" at both ends. In this context, properties (1.1) are obligatory. However, for efficiency, one would like (s) (0) = (s) (1) = 0 s 2 <ref> [1; p] </ref> (1:4) for a moderate or large value of p. <p> In the present paper we restrict to Sidi's transformations. We expect however that the results extend to Laurie's transformations, but only partially since the symmetry of Sidi's transformations about the endpoints is not shared by Laurie's polynomial transformations. The present paper is about integration over <ref> [0; 1] </ref> N using Sidi's transformation for each of the N components. We are particularly interested in quadrature error expansions of the Euler-Maclaurin type. When the integrand function is regular, the expansion (Theorem 5.2) turns out to be precisely what one might expect from the one-dimensional theory. <p> Q x 1 m1 X f x + k ! Applied to an offset trapezoidal rule, the Euler-Maclaurin expansion takes the form 1 m1 X f x + k q X Z 1 f (s) (t)dt m s s! 1 Z 1 f (q) (t)h q (x mt)dt; (x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>); (2:2) where fi s is the Bernoulli polynomial of degree s and h q (x) = q! Observe that the first term in this expansion is If . <p> Applied in the context of (2.1), the Euler Maclaurin expansion provides an asymptotic expansion for the error of a general m-copy rule applied to a regular integrand f (x) as stated in the following theorem. Theorem 2.1 When f (x) and its first q derivatives are integrable over <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, Q (m) f If = s=1 m s + o (m q ); (2:3) where B s (Q; f ) = c s (Q) 0 i j and 4 When f (x) has singular behavior within the interval [0,1], expansion (2.3) is not valid. <p> Theorem 2.2 When f (x) = x ff g (x) and g (x) and its first q derivatives are integrable over <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, Q (m) f If = t m ff+1+t + s=1 m s + o (m q ); (2:9) where the index t in the first summation runs through the nonnegative integers not larger than q Re (ff) 1 and When Q involves a function value f (0) that is <p> A major concern in this paper is the vanishing (or otherwise) of coefficients in expansions of this general nature. A traditional integration procedure which uses extrapolation is Romberg integration [9] (see also Bauer, Rutishauser, and Stiefel <ref> [1] </ref> . This is based on (2.3) using mesh ratios m i = 2 i , i = 0; 1; 2; : : :, and setting Q to be the endpoint trapezoidal rule. <p> On the other hand, when p is odd, either both c s (R) and its cofactor are zero or, in general, neither. Hence we have the following specialization of Theorem 2.1. 7 Theorem 3.1 When p is an integer and f (x) has integrable derivatives of order q over <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, then R (m) F p If = s even s 2 [p + 1; q] m s + o (m q ): (3:11) where p = 2p + 1 or p depending on whether p is even or odd. 4 Sidi Transformations for f (x) = x ff We <p> given by Sidi. (At most, we have given explicitly the terms in the expansion that are implicit in Sidi's work.) We have modified some proofs in order to facilitate a subsequent generalization to a multidimensional context. 5 Multidimensional Transformation (Regular) When f (x) is regular, the theory surrounding integration over <ref> [0; 1] </ref> N using the Cartesian product of N one-dimensional Sidi transformations is straightforward. One may allow different meshes m i in each component and different p-values, say p i , without seriously disturbing this straightforward theory. <p> However, one may expand a general quadrature rule Q in terms of one-point rules, and so obtain the following general theorem. Theorem 5.1 When f (x) together with all partial derivatives of total order q or less are integrable over <ref> [0; 1] </ref> N , then Q (m) f If = s=1 m s + o (m q ); (5:4) where B s (Q; f ) = jsj=s X c s (Q) [0;1] N and N Y fi s i (x i ) ! 10 We now apply this theorem to the <p> One may then apply the result (3.10) to each component in turn to find B s 1 ;s 2 :::s N (R; F p ) = 0 when any s i 2 <ref> [1; 2p + 1] </ref>; (5:11) giving B s (R; F p ) = 0 s 2 [1; 2p + 1]; (5:12) which provides an N -dimensional version of Theorem 3.1 s follows. <p> One may then apply the result (3.10) to each component in turn to find B s 1 ;s 2 :::s N (R; F p ) = 0 when any s i 2 <ref> [1; 2p + 1] </ref>; (5:11) giving B s (R; F p ) = 0 s 2 [1; 2p + 1]; (5:12) which provides an N -dimensional version of Theorem 3.1 s follows. <p> Theorem 5.2 When p is an integer and f (x) has integrable derivatives of order q over <ref> [0; 1] </ref> N and F p is given by (5.7) R (m) F p If = s even s 2 [p + 1; q] m s + o (m q ); (5:13) where p = 2p + 1 or p depending on whether p is even or odd. 11 6 Singular <p> Several coefficients given below have integral representations in terms of these L-shaped regions. Of these, some require integrals on U N = L N <ref> [1; 1] </ref>, which may be expressed as a sum of (N 1)- dimensional integrals as follows: Z f (x)d N1 x := j=1 0 Z 1 f (x 1 ; : : : ; x j1 ; 1; x j+1 ; : : :; x N )dx 1 dx j1 dx <p> N1 x (6.5) q X B s (Q; f ) + jsj=q L N [1;1) R q (Q; m; f ) = m qffN X Z Q x h s (x; t)f (s) (t)d N t = O (1): (6.7) When Q is symmetric w.r.t. the center of the cube <ref> [0; 1] </ref> N , then B s (Q; f ) = 0 for s odd. This was proved first by Lyness [7]. <p> functions, then so do f + g and f g, and these expansions are obtained by formal addition and multiplication. * When f (x) = h (x)g (x), where h (x) is a smooth homogenous function of degree ff on L N (0; 1) and g (x) is smooth on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> N , then f (x) admits an expansion in homogeneous functions of degree (ffi j ) 1 j=0 with ffi j = ff + j. <p> Theorem 6.8 Under the hypotheses of Theorem 6.7 we have B s (R; F p ) = 0; s is odd or s 2 <ref> [1; p] </ref>: where, as before, p denotes either 2p + 1 or p depending on whether p is even or odd. In Section 8, we shall treat families of homogeneous functions depending analytically on a parameter. <p> Proof of Theorem 6.8. Fix an s that is odd or that does not exceed p. Let f z and F z;p be as in the discussion above. Then, for sufficiently large Re (z), the partial derivatives of F z;p (x) of order s are continuous on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> N . We can then rely on Theorem 5.2 to state that B s (R; F z;p ) vanishes for sufficiently large Re (z). <p> We now state the results of carrying out this procedure in a standard case, where f (x) = f ff (x)g (x) and, as before, f ff (x) is a smooth homogeneous function of degree ff and g (x) is C 1 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> N . 16 Using a multivariate Maclaurin expansion, we may expand g (x) in a sequence of smooth homoge-neous functions of nonnegative integer degree, providing an expansion for f (x) comprising terms of homogeneous degree ffi (j) = ff + j. <p> Applying Theorems 6.7 and 6.8 to each of these functions in turn, one finds the following. Theorem 6.9 When f (x) = f ff (x)g (x) and f ff (x) is a smooth homogeneous function of degree ff on L N (0; 1) and g (x) is C 1 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> N , then R (m) F p ' If + t2T m fi+N+t + s2S m s ; (6:14) where fi = (ff + N )(p + 1) N and the integer sets S and T are p odd, : S = f all even s p + 1g <p> the integer sets S and T are p odd, : S = f all even s p + 1g : T = f all even t 0g p even, : S = f all even s 2p + 2g : T = f all t 0 except odd t 2 <ref> [1; p 1] </ref>g: If g (x) is even, i.e., if its Taylor expansion about the origin involves only monomials of even degree, then we have for even p the stronger result S = f all even s 2p + 2g : T = f all even t 0g: The reader will <p> The integrals of h (x; y) and f (x; y) over <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 are respectively Ih = (32=5)(2 1=4 1) = 1:210925536017414827; 18 8 Integrands depending Analytically on a Parameter Many simple homogeneous functions f (x) are naturally embedded in a family of homogeneous functions that depend analytically on the degree z. <p> By (5.5), R q;K;s (z) = B s (Q; r q;K;z ) (z 2 K) can be expressed as a linear combination of the integrals on the cube <ref> [0; 1] </ref> N of the partial derivatives of order s of r q;K;z (x). We now consider an approximation to R q;K;s (z). <p> We now consider an approximation to R q;K;s (z). This is R *;q;K;s (z) (* &gt; 0), an expression obtained from (5.5) by replacing these integrals on the cube by integrals on the region L N <ref> [*; 1] </ref>. Since the partial derivatives of r q;K;z (x) depend analytically on z when x is restricted to L N [*; 1], we have that R *;q;K;s (z) is an analytic function on . <p> This is R *;q;K;s (z) (* &gt; 0), an expression obtained from (5.5) by replacing these integrals on the cube by integrals on the region L N <ref> [*; 1] </ref>.

As f is homogeneous of degree ff, we have 1 X f x + k 1 1 X f k (x); (A:1) where f k (x) = f (k + x). As f k is smooth on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> N , it can be replaced by its Euler-Maclaurin expansion (5.3) (with m = 1) f k (x) = jsjq Z f (s) (t + k)d N t i=1 s i !

We denote the cube [k 1 ; k 1 + 1] fi [k 2 ; k 2 + 1] fi fi [k N ; k N + 1] 23 by k + <ref> [0; 1] </ref> N ; summation over k yields X f k (x) = jsjq Z f (s) (t)d N t i=1 s i ! + jsj=q L N [1;m] The integrand f (s) in (A.2) is homogeneous of degree ff jsj. <p> Therefore, by Lemma A.1, we can write Z f (s) (t)d N t = m ffjsj+N 1 ff jsj + N U N Each integral over L N <ref> [1; m] </ref> in (A.3) may be expressed as the difference of the integral over L N [1; 1) and the integral over L N [m; 1). Separating the terms with different asymptotic behavior w.r.t. m, and applying Q to the sum (A.1), gives the relation (6.4). <p> Obviously, we have f ( p (t 1 ); : : :; p (t N )) = g (OE (t 1 ); : : : ; OE (t N )); (B:2) where OE (t) = ( p (t)) p+1 : (B:3) This function OE : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> !

Reference-contexts: computing purposes as well as theoretical analysis, a transformation whose derivative is symmetric is often convenient; that is, 0 (1 t) = 0 (t): (1:5) While individual numerical approaches of this type must be as old as computing machines themselves, the first systematic investigation appears to be due to Korobov <ref> [4] </ref> in 1963.
