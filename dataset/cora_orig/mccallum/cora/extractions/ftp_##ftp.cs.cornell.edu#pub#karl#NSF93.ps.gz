Abstract: We are applying tools from computational topology and combinatorial geometry in our investigation of computational aspects of engineering design problems. We seek tractable algorithmic solutions by exploiting algebraic formulations of the fundamental computational-topological problems arising in the kinematic and dynamic analysis of microelectromechanical (MEM) structures. In particular, we use concepts from computational topology and geometry to determine the shape of microelectromechanical (MEM) structures, given specifications of their parameterized geometry and their functionality (parametric design). MEM structures are particularly suited for automated parametric design because of (i) their highly specialized and automated production process, which allows only a very limited number of elementary structures, (ii) the tractable geometry and functionality of the devices, and (iii) the possibly large number of devices produced simultaneously in one manufacturing process. Kinematic interactions between mechanism components are reflected in their configuration space. Each pair of components in contact is responsible for a (hyper-) surface region (algebraic variety) in configuration space. We describe a class of mechanisms (micromechanical hinged structures) whose kinematic interactions can be encoded by low-degree algebraic curves in configuration space. We then compute the topology of the arrangement created by these curves. Two surface regions in the arrangement are adjacent if and only if there exists a physically feasible mechanical transition between the corresponding contact states of the mechanism. Adjacency relationships in the configuration space arrangement define a dual graph whose nodes represent contact states of the mechanism, and whose edges represent mechanical state transitions. This "configuration space graph" can be interpreted as a concise encoding of the relationship between configuration space topology and kinematic behavior of the mechanism. The problem of parametric design can be solved by determining design parameter values such that a required mechanism behavior is achieved. The incorporation of design parameters into the mechanism geometry is reflected in configuration space by a particular family of surfaces parameterizations. The topology of the surface arrangement will therefore depend on the specific parameter values. We describe an algorithm that determines all possible arrangement topologies and their corresponding design parameter values for the class of microme- chanical hinged structures. If the required mechanism behavior can be obtained by a certain configuration space topology then the algorithm solves the parametric design problem. Now, general mechanical system behavior is also constrained by dynamics, friction, and other constitutive differential inclusions. We intend to annotate the permissible configuration space topologies for the mechanism with the dynamically feasible transitions by lifting our analysis to the tangent bundle. Already, our kinematic analysis to design will significantly simplify the solution of the other subproblems. The microscopic size of MEM structures, the possibly large number of devices employed simultaneously, and uncertainty in the manufacturing process suggest the use of randomizing assembly algorithms. We develop a connection between randomization techniques and our approach for design automation.

Reference-contexts: The structures are rotated into place either by a probe station under the microscope (which is very labor intensive) or by hydraulic forces, i.e. shaking the wafer under water, such that the random motion of the water moves the parts into their final position <ref> ( Burgett et al. 1992 ) </ref> . The problem then is how to design such microme- chanical devices. <p> The basic idea is to use randomized motions whenever the uncertainty in the sensor readings is too large to be of any use for motion planning. This is of particular interest for the assembly of microelectromechanical structures. In fact, <ref> ( Burgett et al. 1992 ) </ref> use a randomized strategy to assemble the hinged structures described in section 2.1, by shaking the wafer under water such that the random motion of the water moves the plates into their final position.

Reference-contexts: E.g., all configurations where a vertex of one part of the mechanism slides along a surface of another part could form such a region. The shape of every region is governed by a unique set of conditions derived from the geometry of the mechanism. <ref> ( Donald and Pai 1992 ) </ref> describe classes of mechanisms that generate low-degree algebraic equations for these conditions, and give an efficient algorithm to compute them. We assume that the mechanism usually operates in configurations corresponding to C-space surfaces, and not in free space. <p> For an "outside" edge (5) has to be negated. The negated equation is never satisfied. Therefore sticking at Type-B contact can only occur with "inside" edges. 4 Approach 4.1 C-Space of Model In the model for rigid bodies in compliant contact de <p>- scribed in <ref> ( Donald and Pai 1992 ) </ref> , contacts of mechanism parts define curves in their two-dimensional configuration space. These curves are algebraic of low- degree. Simulation of snap fasteners then is reduced to computing the arrangement of curves in the C-space plane. <p> This yields an efficient simulation algorithm and avoids numerical integration of motion. Our hinged structure has two rotational degrees of freedom. This makes the curves that describe the contact constraints more complicated. A simplification to algebraic curves as in <ref> ( Donald and Pai 1992 ) </ref> is possible, but leads to polynomial curves of high degree, so the approach is not applicable. <p> The graph is sparse, because the number of outgoing edges for each state is bounded by 2, one each for moving clockwise or counterclockwise on the C-space curve infinitesimally. The C-space graph in our model for hinged structures is the equivalent to the arrangement of C-space curves in <ref> ( Donald and Pai 1992 ) </ref> . However, in the C- space graph only the intersections of the curves are computed explicitly. Each curve segment is described by a single transition node. This means no loss of information, because all points on this curve segment obey the same equations.

Reference-contexts: In fact, ( Burgett et al. 1992 ) use a randomized strategy to assemble the hinged structures described in section 2.1, by shaking the wafer under water such that the random motion of the water moves the plates into their final position. <ref> ( Erdmann 1989 ) </ref> investigates randomized strategies for both discrete and continuous state spaces. For the discrete case, he shows that the expected time of goal attainment in randomized tasks is low if the state space of the mechanism can be modeled by Markov chains. <p> This creates a promising connection to C- space graphs. If we label C-space graph edges with probabilities of being traversed, then we can apply the theory developed in <ref> ( Erdmann 1989 ) </ref> to predict the behavior of the mechanism. In particular, we can compute the probability that a certain desired state is reached. The crucial task now is to determine these probabilities.
