Abstract: This paper describes the configuration of a oor-tile installation robot for commercial buildings. The research is motivated by the need to reduce the installation time and cost while guaranteeing consistent quality. In order to compete with human installation, a time of 24 seconds per installed tile has to be matched. The technical solution that is deemed feasible and capable of reducing this time to about 10 seconds, is an autonomous, electrically-powered mobile robot with omni-directional locomotive capability, and stereo cameras and light-striper for sensing. High resolution imaging is needed to identify tile seams and edges, assess the quality of automatic installation, and locate where the next tile should be placed. A mechanically compliant placement device would place the tile quickly and accurately without damaging the placed and surrounding tiles, emulating a human capability. Vinyl/ceramic tiles, adhesives, and grout are carried onboard the robot and replenished by the operator. Navigation and positioning are performed through a laser-based triangulation system, and by detecting, counting and dead-reckoning off of tiles placed on the oor. Tile and installation quality are continuously monitored and errors corrected for, based on an overall layout map.

The robotic performance numbers presented here are estimates based on image processing, computing, and mechanical component performance capabilities.

Reference-contexts: mechanic and a helper would be expected to place 2,500 to 3,000 ft. 2 per day at an hourly rate of $26.00, which means that it takes 10-12 seconds to install a tile (or 312-375 tiles/hour) and it costs about $2,800 - $3,400 to install the 40,000 ft. 2 oor. <ref> [3] </ref> Tile Attributes: The variety of sizes and shapes of tiles gives an indication of the handling and placement problem that this robot system will have to address. <p> Furthermore basic robot size and subcomponent complexity can be initially inferred from the need to package and handle a variety of different tile shapes and sizes in order to lay a completely arbitrary pattern.

Reference-contexts: The tiles represented a cross section of reective properties expected to be encountered, from highly specular to highly diffuse. Two well known low level image processing techniques, the Canny operator and the Hough transform, were applied to the images <ref> [4] </ref>, [5]. The Canny operator detects the edges in the tile images and the Hough transform is used to model the strongest lines in the edge image.

Reference-contexts: Normal operation will be on an extremely at oor, where the only obstacles are facility obstacles are facility features, like columns. Locomotion: Possible locomotion schemes include a separate and dedicated drive/steer module with two motors and transmissions per wheel, or an omni-directional Mecanum wheel <ref> [6] </ref>, [7], with a single motor/transmission arrangement per wheel. The mobility requirements for task completion and the facility constraints dictate the need for providing omni-directional motion capability [8]. Motion coordination of omni-directional wheels allows for in-place turning and fine adjustments of vehicle heading, important attributes to accurately position the robot.

Reference-contexts: Handling of the tiles could be via vacuum feet, or simple grasping and rolling. Further design and experimentation will yield the necessary results to decide on a single solution. <ref> [9] </ref> 4. Robot Design and Navigation The conceptual design for the tile installation robot is shown in Figure 6. The robot is a four-wheel drive vehicle Mobile Robot for Automatic Tile Installation with omni-directional wheels. <p> Preliminary cost-benefit analysis indicates that prototype mobile tiling robots should be limited to lay tiles in large commercial acreage areas, leaving the odd and cut tile sections to either human installation, or robot-assisted installation using either specialized tooling or a small special-purpose machine. <ref> [9] </ref> The robot is to initially be assisted by a human operator for deployment, facility sizing, tiling-job planning and initiation of the tile placement sequence.
