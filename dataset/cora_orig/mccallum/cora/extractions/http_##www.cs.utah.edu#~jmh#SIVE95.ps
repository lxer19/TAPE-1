Reference-contexts: Afterwards, the same data can then be used to determine mass moments for the purpose of gravity compensation. A future refinement would be to determine also the other inertial parameters using automatic methods <ref> (Atkeson et al. 1986) </ref> and compensate for inertial torques due to movement, yet except for high-speed motions gravity torques are by far dominant. 4 and gravity compensation for the Sarcos Dextrous Arm Slave. 4 Discussion Future research will address haptic rendering and the interface of such devices to real-time CAD/CAM systems.

Reference-contexts: By creating a robot manipulator whose end effector is the tool handle, the opera-tor grasping this tool handle can be made to feel the same forces as in actual use of the tool <ref> (e.g, Buttolo and Hannaford 1995) </ref>. Rather than restrict this notion to tools, pieces of the environment such as a light switch can be mounted on a robot arm and presented to the operator in any position. Yet there are limitations.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, the term haptic interface has caught on and will likely persist. Especially from a sensory standpoint, it is catchy to speak of a haptic channel that parallels the auditory channel and visual channel. Haptic interfaces have been categorized as body-based or ground-based <ref> (Durlach and Ma-vor, 1994) </ref>, depending on whether the interface is attached to the body (exoskeleton) or to the ground (hand controller). This dichotomy is not perfect, as combinations of the two in a single device are conceivable. <p> Each position tracking method has strengths and weaknesses <ref> (Durlach and Ma-vor 1994) </ref>, but for finger-tracking or whole-body tracking then goniometers have significant advantages including lower costs, short lags, high sampling rates, fuller kinematic coverage, and reasonable accuracy.

Reference-contexts: Another problem is calibration, both of the goniometer and of the human. Analog position sensors have to be calibrated periodically for gain and bias; this is a classical robot kinematic calibration problem <ref> (Hollerbach and Wampler, 1995) </ref>. Reference positions of a goniometer relative to limb joints have to be established. Limb segment lengths have to be individualized for each operator; otherwise, someone examining the design of virtual kitchens won't have the proper reach to countertops.

Reference-contexts: Nonarticulated master gloves such as the VPL DataGlove are much less accurate and do not measure finger abduction well <ref> (Hong and Tan 1989) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In evolving usage, hap-tic interfaces encompass arms and hands but not legs. Yet the remaining distinction between locomotion interfaces and haptic interfaces is somewhat artificial, since inverted robot arms may serve as foot platforms (e.g., a 3D stair climber) or cables may tug at the feet <ref> (Iwata 1992) </ref>. Some other term, perhaps mechanical interfaces, would have been preferable to indicate a mechanical device manipulated by the body without indicating what part of the body. Nevertheless, the term haptic interface has caught on and will likely persist.

Reference-contexts: An example is the Sarcos Dextrous Arm Master (Figure 5), which is a hydraulically powered 10 degree-of-freedom (DOF) manipulator. The kinematics of this master roughly match the human arm kinematics, including a spherical shoulder joint, a hinge elbow joint, a spherical roll-pitch-yaw wrist, and a 3-fingered gripper <ref> (Jacobsen et al. 1991) </ref>. In the gripper, the thumb has two DOFs and the fingers have one. There is a roughly isomorphic hydraulic slave (Figure 6). The hydraulic actuation allows the arm to be much lighter, stronger, and quicker than would be possible with electric actuation.

Ordinarily, torque sensors are calibrated only once on a bench, then assembled into an arm. Recently, an automatic torque sensor calibration method has been devised to adjust for drift in gain and bias <ref> (Ma et al. 1994) </ref>. This method uses an arm's own weight as a load to the joints, without however requiring any knowledge about mass properties.

Reference-contexts: By contrast, straightforward linkage designs such as the Exos Dextrous Hand Master <ref> (Marcus 1992) </ref> could potentially give different readings depending on how that master glove is put on, because the readings depend on the location of the attachment points. Nonarticulated master gloves such as the VPL DataGlove are much less accurate and do not measure finger abduction well (Hong and Tan 1989).

Reference-contexts: The result will be a certain degree of inaccuracy or slippage at attachment points. (Other tracking methods will also have difficulties in determining centers of rotation.) For master gloves, the Utah Dextrous Hand Master (Figure 3) circumvents this problem by employing four-bar linkages to directly measure the finger flexion angles <ref> (Rohling, Hollerbach and Jacobsen 1993) </ref>. Assuming the pads are well adhered to finger link surfaces by the lycra glove to which the exoskeleton is attached, then the finger flexion angles are measured exactly because the angles between adjacent pads are measured (Figure 4).
