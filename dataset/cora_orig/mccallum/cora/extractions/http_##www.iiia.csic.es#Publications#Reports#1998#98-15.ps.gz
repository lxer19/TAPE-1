Abstract: To be successful in open, multi-agent environments, autonomous agents must be capable of adapting their negotiation strategies and tactics to their prevailing circumstances. To this end, we present an empirical study showing the relative success of different strategies against different types of opponent in different environments. In particular, we adopt an evolutionary approach in which strategies and tactics correspond to the genetic material in a genetic algorithm. We conduct a series of experiments to determine the most successful strategies and to see how and when these strategies evolve depending on the context and negotiation stance of the agent's opponent.

Reference-contexts: Here we limit ourselves to consider issues for which negotiation amounts to determining a value between a delimited range (i.e. x j 2 D j = [min j ; max j ]). Each agent has a scoring function V a j : D a j ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> that gives the score agent a assigns to the value x of issue j in the range of its acceptable values D a j . For convenience, scores are kept in the interval [0; 1] and scoring functions are either monoton ically increasing or decreasing. <p> Each agent has a scoring function V a j : D a j ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> that gives the score agent a assigns to the value x of issue j in the range of its acceptable values D a j . For convenience, scores are kept in the interval [0; 1] and scoring functions are either monoton ically increasing or decreasing. <p> Behaviour-dependent tactics These tactics base their actions on the behaviour of their negotiation opponent <ref> [1] </ref>. They differ in which aspect of the opponent's behaviour they imitate and to what degree. <p> By default, if the duration of the negotiation does not permit a tactic to be applied (i.e. t &lt; 2ffi), the agent employs a Conceder tactic with fi = 2 (in line with Axelrod's recommendation <ref> [1] </ref>). <p> 12 : : : fl 1m . . . . . . fl p1 fl p2 : : : fl pm C C defined in the following way: x a!b [j] = ( a!b fl T a (M S t n+1 With (T a (M S t n+1 t n+1 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and for all issues j, P m i=1 fl ji = 1. <p> Size of window over which average is computed. 2 To ensure there is no interference between negotiation issues during the evaluation of the GA's results, different tactics are used for each issue. Thus if there are p issues and q 2 <ref> [1; 6] </ref> tactic families we define q concrete tactics (by fixing the parameters in the family expressions) per issue. So the total number of concrete tactics an agent employs in a particular thread is m = p fi q. <p> Axelrod suggests there are three basic ways of determining the best interaction strategy in a given context: tournament, ecological and territorial <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> We would like to see how changing within the lifetime of an agent allows it to adapt to repeated negotiations with its opponents. Secondly, we wish to extend our evolutionary approach to cover the territorial case <ref> [1] </ref>. Here populations are distributed on a 2-D surface and agents can only negotiate with their neighbours. Depending on the outcome of this negotiation, the agent may adopt the strategy of its neighbour if it is more successful.

Reference-contexts: It indicates, for the first time, the relative success of the various strategies and how these strategies evolve over time to better fit their environment. Secondly, it extends the range and sophistication of interactions studied in the field of artificial social systems <ref> [2] </ref> (see section 5 for more details). The remainder of the paper is structured in the following manner. Section 2 summarises our service-oriented negotiation model. Section 3 describes the encoding and operation of the GA and how populations were evolved. Section 4 presents our experimental results and discusses their implications. <p> Our preliminary evaluation of the service-oriented model indicates that negotiation behaviour is strongly influenced by the time available [5]. Thus, our evolutionary experiments are split into two groups: those in which there is a short time available (t a max 2 <ref> [2; 5] </ref>) and those in which time is plentiful (t a max 2 [10; 20]). For both cases, we consider the following types of agent population: E 1 : All buying (selling) agents employ a tactic from the same family (subsection 4.1).

Reference-contexts: To counter the subjectivity problem, we define a fitness function that compares the utility associated to the deal with that associated to the Nash equilibrium point (the point at which the sellers' and the buyers' scoring functions are equal <ref> [3] </ref>). The more positive the difference, the more successful the agent's behaviour. The cost involved in attaining a deal is taken into consideration by associating a charge with each message interchange the more messages exchanged in coming to a deal, the higher the associated cost.

Reference-contexts: To be effective, the selection mechanism should ensure that as diverse a range of fit agents make it into the MP as possible (especially in the early stages). A selection mechanism known to work well in such circumstances is Tournament Selection <ref> [4] </ref>. For this reason, it is the mechanism we employ to select from P t B , those individuals that will reproduce. Tournament selection works in the following way: k individuals are randomly chosen from the population.

Reference-contexts: Given such constraints, experience indicates that a heuristic approach to modelling negotiation is often the most appropriate [9]. In line with this view, we have developed a model of negotiation which relies on strategies and tactics to define an agent's behaviour <ref> [5, 13] </ref>. This model was devised for a real-world business process management system [8] in which the agents need to agree who should perform a particular service and under what terms and conditions. We term such negotiation service-oriented. <p> To this end, we have already reported initial results about which types of tactic are suitable for which types of environment <ref> [5] </ref>. Our aim in this paper, therefore, is to extend this analysis by considering how the agents' negotiation strategies evolve. The technique we adopt for evolving strategies is Genetic Algorithms (GAs) [6]. <p> Section 4 presents our experimental results and discusses their implications. Section 5 places our work in context. Section 6 outlines the avenues of further research. 2. The service-oriented negotiation model Our multi-lateral negotiation model is based on a set of mutually influencing two parties, many issues negotiations <ref> [5, 13] </ref>. Such negotiations involve two roles that are, in principle, in conflict: Sellers of services and Buyers of services. <p> In particular, we want to determine which strategies are appropriate in which situations (given that there is no universal best strategy). Our preliminary evaluation of the service-oriented model indicates that negotiation behaviour is strongly influenced by the time available <ref> [5] </ref>. Thus, our evolutionary experiments are split into two groups: those in which there is a short time available (t a max 2 [2; 5]) and those in which time is plentiful (t a max 2 [10; 20]). <p> Our preliminary evaluation of the service-oriented model indicates that negotiation behaviour is strongly influenced by the time available [5].

Each field has concentrated on different aspects of negotiation, making the assumptions that are pertinent for the goal of their study. For reasons which we have outlined elsewhere <ref> [5] </ref>, much of this extant work is inappropriate for the types of negotiations we encountered in the domain of business process management. Hence we needed to devise a new model to better reflect our needs.

Reference-contexts: Our aim in this paper, therefore, is to extend this analysis by considering how the agents' negotiation strategies evolve. The technique we adopt for evolving strategies is Genetic Algorithms (GAs) <ref> [6] </ref>. The long term goal of this research is to study the dynamics of agent populations how the relative presence of strategies changes as populations co-evolve, whether populations have stable equilibrium points, and how changes in an agent, or group of agents, alter the equilibria. <p> Co-evolving the negotiation strategies GAs generate a sequence of ever improving (fitter) populations as the outcome of a search method modelled by a selection mechanism, crossover (recombining existing genetic material in new ways) and mutation (introducing new genetic material by random modifications) <ref> [6] </ref>. In our case, the individuals of the population are negotiating agents, and their genetic material is the parameters of the negotiation tactics and their relative importance weightings. <p> Size of window over which average is computed. 2 To ensure there is no interference between negotiation issues during the evaluation of the GA's results, different tactics are used for each issue. Thus if there are p issues and q 2 <ref> [1; 6] </ref> tactic families we define q concrete tactics (by fixing the parameters in the family expressions) per issue. So the total number of concrete tactics an agent employs in a particular thread is m = p fi q.

Reference-contexts: Ito extends Axelrod's work by considering more complex tactics, but, nevertheless, retains the simplicity of the Prisoner's Dilemma environment <ref> [7] </ref>. Our approach also incorporates Axelrod's ecological model, but we include mutation and crossover as operations in the evolution of populations. The territorial approach is left as future work. A number of researchers have attempted to use GAs and evolutionary programming to find optimal interaction strategies.

Reference-contexts: So the total number of concrete tactics an agent employs in a particular thread is m = p fi q. This means there are (p 1)q zeros in each row of . 5 k <ref> [10, 100] </ref> j inc k [2,6] j dec k 0.5 j 0.1 j j 0.1 j 0.2 j 0,6 j j 0.05 k 0.02 j 20 max D a 2 T ype V 2 fl 1;1 fl 1;2 fl 1;6 fl 2;7 fl 2;8 fl 2;12 fi boulware 1 fi conceder <p> This process is repeated N times, where N is the size of the population. k is called the tournament size (which in our case is 2) and it determines the degree to which the best individuals are favoured <ref> [10] </ref>. Once the seller and buyer MPs have been created, the individual with the highest fitness in each pool is selected (respectively, Best MP S and Best MP B ). These agents will definitely form part of the new population. <p> Thus, our evolutionary experiments are split into two groups: those in which there is a short time available (t a max 2 [2; 5]) and those in which time is plentiful (t a max 2 <ref> [10; 20] </ref>). For both cases, we consider the following types of agent population: E 1 : All buying (selling) agents employ a tactic from the same family (subsection 4.1). <p> They tend to in crease the value of j , thus becoming more Boulware like, so they can exploit more conciliatory tactics (Figure 4). 4.1.3 Experiments with large t a max We repeated the above set of experiments with a large time (t a max 2 <ref> [10; 20] </ref>) to reach an agreement (Figure 5). In most cases, results are broadly similar to those when t a max is short. Again Resource tactics are the most successful but for a large t a max the Conceder tactics improve their rating.

The territorial approach is left as future work. A number of researchers have attempted to use GAs and evolutionary programming to find optimal interaction strategies. Oliver considers negotiation strategies <ref> [11] </ref> and his work has several similarities to our own (eg each negotiating agent is a chromosome and the parameters of the negotiation model are genes in the chromosome). However, his model is much simpler. (Offers are accepted if they have a utility over a preset threshold.

Reference-contexts: Coevolution refers to the fact that both the buyer and seller populations are simultaneously evolving and that the fitness of an individual in one population is based on direct com petition with individuals from the other population <ref> [12] </ref>. To find strategies which are optimally adapted for partic ular negotiation situations, we need to indicate: how strategies are encoded as genes (3.1), how the fitness of the strate gies is computed (3.2), and how the search algorithm oper ates in detail (3.3). 3.1. <p> For example, our encoding necessarily entails that there are gene interdependencies which need to be respected during the crossover and mutation operations (Oliver has no such dependencies). Rosin <ref> [12] </ref> considers a competitive, co-evolution in which fitness is based on direct competition between individuals selected from two independently evolving populations of hosts and parasites.

Our future work will extend the experimentation in two directions. Firstly, we want to introduce more reactiveness into the agents.
