Reference-contexts: Running the computation for different values of the time step is one indirect technique, and running with different numerical precision is another. Changing from single to double precision is relatively easy, and there are software tools for still higher precision <ref> [Bailey 91] </ref>. Special cases in which an exact solution is possible to test an algorithm are also used. The HL model is one of these special cases.

Reference-contexts: Now it is possible to perform hard sphere computations on systems of over a million particles. A hard sphere model, with millions of molecules, has been used at NASA Ames Research Center by Leonardo Dagum to simulate hypersonic flow conditions encountered by flight vehicles at high altitudes <ref> [Dagum 88] </ref>. Computations using a more realistic molecular model known as Lennard-Jones have been performed at IBM Kingston by Lawrence Hannon, George Lie, and Enrico Climenti to study the flow of fluids [Hannon et al 86]. In these computations the fluid was represented by ~ 10 4 interacting molecules.

Reference-contexts: For this we use only the naive algorithm mentioned: consideration of the more efficient algorithms would carry us beyond the scope of this tutorial. 4.1 Euler's method A discussion of the basic ideas of Euler's method can be found in the tutorial <ref> [Fosdick & Jessup 95] </ref> and any elementary numerical analysis book, for example [Conte & de Boor 80, Burden & Faires 85]. We describe it briefly in terms of the equations we are interested in solving. <p> Henrici shows that the error in this method is O (h 2 ) [Henrici 62]. The basic idea is to approximate the second derivative with a finite difference, x h 2 : The error in this approximation of the second derivative is O (h 2 ), as shown in <ref> [Fosdick & Jessup 95] </ref>. If we use this approximation in equation (10) we obtain x (t + h) 2x (t) x (t h) + h 2 f (x (t)): This, then, is the basis of the algorithm. <p> Here we outline the main ideas leading to the exact solution. In order to understand the material in this section, you need to know about eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices at an elementary level; for example, see <ref> [Fosdick & Jessup 95, section 5.4] </ref>. Consider first the simple case of a single particle moving under the influ ence of an HL force, illustrated earlier in figure 3. <p> Substitution and a little algebraic manipulation produces the result M Q = k You may recognize this as the usual form of a matrix eigenvalue equation where Q is an eigenvector and m! 2 =k is an eigenvalue of the matrix M ; see <ref> [Fosdick & Jessup 95, equation 14] </ref>. Thus our guessed solution satisfies the equations of motion provided that m! 2 =k and Q are an eigenvalue-eigenvector pair of the matrix M .

In these computations the fluid was represented by ~ 10 4 interacting molecules. Even though this is miniscule compared with the number of molecules in a gram of water, the behavior of the flow was like that in a real fluid.

Reference-contexts: For example, simulating the motion of a 1,500-atom molecule, a small protein, for a time interval of 10 10 seconds is a six hour computation on a Cray X-MP. Martin Karplus and Andrew McCammon, in an interesting article "The Molecular Dynamics of Proteins" <ref> [Karplus & McCammon 86] </ref>, describe a discovery concerning the molecule myoglobin that could only have been made through molecular dynamics. The interest in myoglobin comes about because it stores oxygen in biological systems.

Reference-contexts: Verlet's algorithm belongs to the class of symplectic algorithms. These are important for particle dynamics because they keep the total energy almost constant. The article by Sanz-Serna <ref> [Sanz-Serna 92] </ref> describes many of these algorithms and has an extensive list of references.
