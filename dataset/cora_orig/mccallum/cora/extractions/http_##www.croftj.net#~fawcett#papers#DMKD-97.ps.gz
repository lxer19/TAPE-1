Abstract: One method for detecting fraud is to check for suspicious changes in user behavior. This paper describes the automatic design of user profiling methods for the purpose of fraud detection, using a series of data mining techniques. Specifically, we use a rule-learning program to uncover indicators of fraudulent behavior from a large database of customer transactions. Then the indicators are used to create a set of monitors, which profile legitimate customer behavior and indicate anomalies. Finally, the outputs of the monitors are used as features in a system that learns to combine evidence to generate high-confidence alarms. The system has been applied to the problem of detecting cellular cloning fraud based on a database of call records. Experiments indicate that this automatic approach performs better than hand-crafted methods for detecting fraud. Furthermore, this approach can adapt to the changing conditions typical of fraud detection environments.

Reference-contexts: In order to deal with the very large numbers of values for some of the attributes used to describe calls (more than 10,000 values in total), RL also used breadth-first marker propagation techniques, so that the algorithm's time complexity does not depend on the number of attribute values <ref> (Aronis and Provost 1997) </ref>. (RL's time complexity is linear in the number of attributes and the number of examples.) The call data are organized by account, with each call record labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. <p> We have not explored the use of relational learning to any great extent. We have linked the data to knowledge about the geographic locations of telephone numbers <ref> (Aronis and Provost 1997) </ref>, which does produce useful generalizations of the areas to which calls are placed. Finally, it is important to point out additional limitations to the evaluation of learned classifiers on real-world problems.

Reference-contexts: One such method, collision detection, involves analyzing call data for temporally overlapping calls. Since a MIN-ESN pair is licensed to only one legitimate user, any simultaneous usage is probably fraudulent. A closely related method, velocity checking <ref> (Davis and Goyal 1993) </ref>, involves analyzing the locations and times of consecutive calls to determine whether a single user could have placed them while traveling at reasonable speeds.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, it may be possible to learn context in one stage, and then apply relational learning approaches in a later stage. One such possibility is to make use of inductive learners that learn concept descriptions in first-order logic, such as FOIL (Quinlan 1990) or ILP methods <ref> (Dzeroski 1996) </ref>. Given the appropriate context information, it is possible that more expressive methods could learn general relational rules such as the following, which indicates fraud when a user calls from an abnormal location.

Reference-contexts: A bandit is not charged for calls, which are usually worth far more (in retail dollars) than the cost of the cloned phone. Less obviously, cloning fraud allows untraceable communications because the bandit's identity cannot be tied to the cloned account. This second aspect is very important to criminals <ref> (DeMaria and Gidari 1996) </ref>. Cloning fraud is detrimental in many ways. First, fraudulent usage congests cell sites, causing service to be denied to legitimate customers. Second, most cellular calls are to non-cellular destinations, so fraud incurs land-line usage charges.

Reference-contexts: PINs are in use throughout many metropolitan areas in the United States. Unfortunately, like MIN-ESN pairs, PINs are broadcast over the airwaves unencrypted. For technical reasons, PINs are more difficult to receive and decode, but with more sophisticated equipment PIN cracking is possible <ref> (Herzog 1995) </ref>. Although PINs make cloning fraud more difficult, they do not prevent it. Other methods of prevention include RF Fingerprinting and Authentication (Redden 1996). RF Fingerprinting is a method of identifying cellular phones by their transmission characteristics.

Reference-contexts: Some of the rules do not perform well when used in monitors, and some monitors overlap in their fraud detection coverage. We therefore employ a sequential forward selection process <ref> (Kittler 1986) </ref> which chooses a small set of useful monitors. Empirically, this simplifies the final detector and increases its accuracy. The final output of DC-1 is a detector that profiles each user's behavior based on several indicators, and produces an alarm if there is sufficient evidence of fraudulent activity.

Reference-contexts: However, authentication requires changes in hardware: both phones and switches must be capable of processing authentication requests. Currently about thirty million non-authenticatable cell phones are in use in the United States alone, and their replacement will not be immediate <ref> (Steward 1997) </ref>. In the meantime, cloning fraud will continue to be a problem and the industry will rely on post-call fraud detection methods. 2.2.2. Post-call methods Post-call methods periodically analyze call data on each account to determine whether cloning fraud has occurred.

Reference-contexts: Similar to other MetaDENDRAL-style rule learners (Buchanan and Mitchell 1978; Segal and Etzioni 1994; Webb 1995), RL performs a general-to-specific search of the space of conjunctive rules. This type of rule-space search is described in detail by Webb <ref> (Webb 1995) </ref>. In DC-1, RL uses a beam search for rules with certainty factors above a user-defined threshold.
