Abstract: The main problem arising in value exchange over a network, e.g. in the exchange of digital money for other valuable information, is the lack of simultaneity of the exchange, yielding a temporary advantage for one party, who could then stop communication. The situation is even worse when this party is anonymous. This normally is the case when digital payment systems enabling unobservability are used. But third parties can be used to overcome this problem. We compare two rather different approaches using third parties. The first tries to provide security by third parties identifying perpetrators in case of detected fraud, whereas the second uses a third party as trustee who takes an active part in the value exchange and can be completely controlled by each absolutely anonymous party. The users of present-day cashless payment systems are observable since the banks and (by installing a Trojan Horse [4]) even the manufacturers of the computer equipment used can learn who pays what amount to whom and when. With the increasing digitization of these systems, e.g. point-of-sale terminals and home banking, the amount of transaction data and their computerization drastically increases. Thereby, these payment systems become completely unacceptable, since compiling dossiers on the lifestyle and whereabouts of all clients will become easy. Therefore, in [2] we summarized the digital payment systems enabling unobservability of clients and explained the technical capabilities needed to support unobservability.

Reference-contexts: With the increasing digitization of these systems, e.g. point-of-sale terminals and home banking, the amount of transaction data and their computerization drastically increases. Thereby, these payment systems become completely unacceptable, since compiling dossiers on the lifestyle and whereabouts of all clients will become easy. Therefore, in <ref> [2] </ref> we summarized the digital payment systems enabling unobservability of clients and explained the technical capabilities needed to support unobservability. 2 If these payment systems are used to anonymously buy ware (valuable information, e.g. the answer to a database query) for digital money, an additional security problem is posed: The lack <p> Because the payment is made in two parts, i.e. X pays T first and T pays Y afterwards, it is also impossible to cheat by falsely claiming not to have received the money, since with all payment systems allowing unobservable payments presented in <ref> [2] </ref>, the payer can prove that he has made a payment. 3 . 2 Protocol Variations We describe two further protocol variations: The first handles the case in which the trustee is unable to check the ware. The second sketches a scheme for exchanging two wares. <p> that the identities of the parties exchanging values are revealed by the authenticating third party only in the assigned cases? Uncovered claims may arise because it is never verified that the parties can pay and identification of such parties does not help very much (see Section 4. (1) of ref. <ref> [2] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Both approaches use third parties to bypass the simultaneity problem. Their advantages and disadvantages are summarized in Chapter 4. Both approaches assume that anonymous parties choose keypairs of a digital signature scheme, where the public key to test signatures (test key for short) is used as digital pseudonym, cf. <ref> [3, 2 Chap. 2.2] </ref>. Thus, the identity of parties is given by their digital pseudonyms and the authenticity (and legal relevance) of their messages is conferred by signing them digitally with their corresponding private keys. <p> Subsequently business proceeds as usual. Messages sent are authenticated and made legally binding by digital signatures linked to digital pseudonyms. For the authentication of the pseudonyms, a single trusted third party [8] or a chain of trusted third parties <ref> [3] </ref> may be used. The second method has the property that a party exchanging values can be identified only if all authenticating third parties of the chain are cooperating. It can be extended to tolerate faults or sabotage from a few third parties with the techniques described in [9].

Reference-contexts: Goldreich's solutions to the concurrent identification problem <ref> [6, 7] </ref> cannot be adapted either, because both solutions presuppose a fixed identity of persons which can be established and approved beforehand. This is in contrast to value exchange, where values not known beforehand (e.g. new information, a new cheque, etc.) are to be exchanged.
