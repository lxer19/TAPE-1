Abstract: In this talk we review recent work on integrable models for Microtubule (MT) networks, subneural paracrystalline cytosceletal structures, which seem to play a fundamental role in the neurons. We cast here the complicated MT dynamics in the form of a 1+1-dimensional non-critical string theory, which can be formulated in terms of (dual) Dirichlet branes, according to modern perspectives. We suggest that the MTs are the microsites in the brain, for the emergence of stable, macroscopic quantum coherent states, identifiable with the preconscious states. Quantum space-time effects, as described by non-critical string theory, trigger then an organized collapse of the coherent states down to a specific or conscious state. The whole process we estimate to take O(1 sec), in excellent agreement with a plethora of experimental/observational findings. The complete integrability of the stringy model for MT proves sufficient in providing a satisfactory solution to memory coding and capacity. Such features might turn out to be important for a model of the brain as a quantum computer.

Reference-contexts: The two dimensional black-hole problem is a string soliton problem as discussed in ref. <ref> [13] </ref>. Moreover, in the present MT model, even the flat-space time limit is a kink, characterized by a certain set of collective coordinates. <p> From a world-sheet point of view a target two-dimensional black hole model represents a defect on the world-sheet <ref> [13, 14] </ref> and therefore naturaly incorporates open strings in its spectrum. The end points of such strings carry the gauge charges of the black-hole W 1 -hair carrying information [16].

Reference-contexts: In particular, a special formalism on the world-sheet of the string has started to be developing with the hope of describing interaction of matter with the membrane/black-hole as accurately as possible. The approach utilizes certain `logarithmic operators' <ref> [22, 17] </ref>, which are special marginal world-sheet operators, capable of describing in a conformal-field-theory setting changes of state of the membrane background. <p> This change of state is described by the logarithmic operators. As discussed in ref. <ref> [17] </ref>, this results in decoherence for the effective subsystem of the light degrees of freedom, due to information carried by the (quantum) recoil degrees of freedom pertaining to fluctuations of the collective coordinates of the soliton [22].

Reference-contexts: For consistency, one should get rid of one asymptotic domain by some sort of orbifold procedure, i.e. appropriately projecting the target space time of the string onto a single cigar. This induces, according to the analysis of <ref> [21] </ref>, open strings, and leads to an alternative way of representing the two-dimensional black hole as a Dirichlet brane. Since this meeting, enormous progress has been made in understanding the quantum mechanics of such Dirichlet branes [29].

Due to this decoherence, there are modified measurability bounds in lengths (26), implying modified (length-dependent ) uncertainty relations in the non-crtitical string framework.

From a brain MT viewpoint, the various values of such charges characterize the ground memory states, according to our discussion above <ref> [24] </ref>. The presence of open strings carrying gauge group quantum numbers can also be seen in a totally different way as follows: the 15 two-dimensional black hole space time has a cigar like structure, but it is symmetric about the spatial origin, i.e it has two asymptotically flat domains. <p> We believe, that this formal approach is useful towards a better understanding of important quantum aspects of black hole physics, which have been argued in this talk and in refs. <ref> [28, 24] </ref> to play a role in brain functioning. The recoil phenomenon, for instance, may be identified with a back-reaction of the spin chain of the MT against an externally induced abrupt change in the respective conformations (stimulus).
