Abstract: Data broadcast has been suggested as a promising method of information dissemination in the communication environment with asymmetric characteristic. In such an environment, the information server cannot afford to serve the requests from a large population of users individually. Instead, the server uses a broadcast channel to deliver information to all users. A single transmission of a data item will satisfy all pending requests for that item. However, the quality of service experienced by a single user turns out to be unpredictable and unstable. The response time of a request depends on the broadcast of the desired data item, which is scheduled by the server according to the overall demands for various data items. Therefore, the response time may vary in a large range, which may hinder a user subscribing to this service. We argue that, in addition to mean response time, the variance of response time should also be taken into account by the broadcast scheduler. In this paper, we address the issue of variance optimization in regard to response time. Building on our previous research on mean response time optimization, we propose an algorithm which can minimize the variance of response time. Furthermore, we evaluate an algorithm that facilitates a trade-off between the mean and variance of response time. Numerical examples that illustrate the performances of our algorithms are also presented.

Reference-contexts: In fact, the schedules produced by other schemes in <ref> [1] </ref>, [8] all possess the "equal spacing" property, and we will consider only the schedules with this property in the following analysis. <p> We may regard the broadcast as the composition of M cyclic transmissions with each broadcasting an item in different frequency. In other words, this scenario is the generalization of Broadcast Disks scheme in <ref> [1] </ref>. While the latter applies only 5 to items of identical size, ours applies to items of differing sizes. Note that it is not always possible to construct a schedule strictly spacing the transmissions of each item as designated in a given schedule vector.

Reference-contexts: To alleviate the impact of demand pattern difference between a single user and the user community on the system performance, the use of local cache has been suggested <ref> [2] </ref>. A user may prefetch and store in cache such items that are rarely broadcasted by the server (due to their unpopularity among the user community), but are needed by this particular user. <p> Though the minimal mean and minimal variance are both desirable, they cannot typically be achieved at the same time. Instead, we may try to find a trade-off between them. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce our model of a pure push-based <ref> [2] </ref> data broadcast system and give the definition of variance of response 3 time. Section 3 contains the analysis of a broadcast schedule and its relationship with mean and variance of response time.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In a broadcast data delivery system, a server broadcasts data to a user community <ref> [3, 5, 6, 10] </ref>. The data is organized and transmitted in units called items. The items may be of different lengths and, certainly, of different demands. Some items are requested frequently; we call them globally popular items. On the other hand, some items may only be requested infrequently. <p> In the past, several approaches for determining the actual broadcast schedule so as to reduce the global mean response time have been studied (e.g., <ref> [3, 5, 6, 10] </ref>). Unfortunately, this mean response time is not experienced by any particular user. Instead, it is experienced by a "virtual" user whose demand distribution is same as the demand distribution presented by the whole user population.

Reference-contexts: This may lead to the response time experienced by a single user worse than the global average. Needless to say, the response time from the perspective of an individual user is of more concern than the global average from the perspective of the server <ref> [4] </ref>. To alleviate the impact of demand pattern difference between a single user and the user community on the system performance, the use of local cache has been suggested [2].

The decision mechanism works like a "traffic police" in front of a crowd of vehicles contending the use of a single lane. The "police" has the responsibilities of coordinating the use of the road as well as keeping the road employed to full extent.

When ff = 2, it becomes the Mean Optimal Algorithm. The ff-algorithm was also evaluated by Su and Tassiulas <ref> [8] </ref>. They simulated the ff-algorithm for various values of ff, and impirically showed that ff = 2 minimizes the mean response time. We obtained the same result analytically in our prior work.

Minimizing Variance of Response Time Similar to the above result, we found that a schedule vector must hold the following property in order to minimize the variance of response time: p i s 2 l i 2 s i = constant; 8i; 1 <p> Choose item j such that F j = F max . If this equality holds for more than one item, choose any one of them arbitrarily. Step 4. Broadcast item j. Step 5. R j = Q.

In the rest of this paper, we will refer to it as Mean Optimal Algorithm.
