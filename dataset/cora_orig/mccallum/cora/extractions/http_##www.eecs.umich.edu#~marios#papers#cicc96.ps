Abstract: In recent years, several adiabatic logic architectures have been proposed for low-power VLSI design. However, no work has been presented describing the implementation and evaluation of nontrivial adiabatic circuits. We have evaluated a specific adiabatic architecture and used it in the design of low-power arithmetic units. We investigated implementation issues specific to adiabatic system development and performed a systematic comparison of our designs with corresponding CMOS circuits. In this paper we describe our adiabatic designs, discuss implementation issues at the logic and architectural level, and report our empirical findings.

Reference-contexts: We recently performed an empirical study of several adiabatic logic structures that have been proposed in the literature. We focused our investigation on the logic architecture described in <ref> [4] </ref> and we used it to design adiabatic adders and multipliers with low energy dissipation. In this paper we describe our designs and discuss related logic and architectural level implementation issues such as transistor sizing, data synchronization, latency, and throughput. <p> An architecture inspired by bipolar transistor structures has been proposed in [3].

Inverters from the last three logic families are shown in Our empirical study covered the structures in Figure 1 and focused on the 2N2P architecture with two NMOS and two PMOS transistors in its inverter. <p> The adiabatic logic families we studied require either two or four clock phases for their operation, with relative shifts of 180 o o , respectively.

Reference-contexts: No single logic family covered all of these requirements, but we found that the 2N2P devices covered more than the other structures. 3. Logic-level issues concerning 2N2P The 2N2P logic family is very similar to CMOS CVSL logic <ref> [5] </ref> and thus possesses several of the positive characteristics of conventional CMOS. Since 2N2P gates use ground nodes and avoid diodes, they can drive their output loads to V dd and V ss .
