Reference-contexts: I have developed a new model for distributed decision-making called distributed game automata, which focuses on how communication affects decision-making quality <ref> [1] </ref>. Agents are modeled as stochastic automata which play games with each other, and which try to improve performance using learning heuristics; performance is quantified by payoffs from these games. The decisions in the game regarding what action to perform are made probabilistically; I call this action randomization.

Reference-contexts: Simulations show two primary, but similar, results <ref> [2] </ref>, [3]. If the uncertainty concerning coalition formation is removed (by always forming a coalition), there is a maximum communication delay before poor decisions result concerning processor selection; the agents' decisions oscillate between overloading one processor and then another processor.

I have also examined cases where it is better for one agent to always know a coalition fact than for two agents to sometimes know the fact (and vice versa).

In [PM91] we provide a complete delay analysis for the celebrated FCFS 0.487 Algorithm. Another problem of increasing importance with the proliferation of portable computers and the integration of computing and communications is the provision of location transparency to users and applications.

Reference-contexts: Current I/O system software found in most operating systems is ill-suited for the high throughput requirements of multimedia and scientific applications which have I/O components consisting of video, high quality audio, high resolution images, and massive scientific data sets <ref> [P+91] </ref>. We believe that operating systems design must shift from the traditional focus of managing CPU cycles to that of managing I/O channel bandwidth which is increasingly becoming the scarce resource [P92].

Reference-contexts: It is our experience that the scientists and engineers running these codes are very interested in learning about the performance of their applications. We also performed a workload characterization study of the SDSC Cray X-MP (the predecessor to the Cray Y-MP), running the CTSS operating system <ref> [PBK91] </ref>. In this work, our underlying strategy has been to recognize the attributes of the workload being submitted by the national academic research community for execution on the supercomputers at SDSC.

Reference-contexts: First, we built a simple audio conferencing system using standard system software, specifically the X Window System, SunOS, and TCP/IP, using Sun Sparcstations connected by Ethernet <ref> [TP91] </ref>. This study demonstrated the simplicity and naturalness of using the window system interface for audio, and how to support a form of continuous media without having operating system support for real-time guarantees.

Reference-contexts: We have also investigated file system design for very large file I/O such as that required for scientific applications or multimedia (e.g. audio and video) applications <ref> [MP91] </ref>. The design was driven by results of a file workload characterization study we carried out on a heavily utilized file system at UCSD. File requests at the system call level were characterized as either control (e.g. open, close, chmod), data read, or data write.

Reference-contexts: The project was initiated by DEC with initial seed funding totaling $15 million for 3 years; additional sponsors are now being sought. CSL, in collaboration with Domenico Ferrari at UC Berkeley, is responsible for designing and building the Sequoia 2000 Network <ref> [FPP92] </ref>. The Sequoia 2000 Network is a private, wide area packet switched network optimized for real-time transfer of large objects. It consists of 45 Mb/s T3 backbone connecting the Sequoia 2000 campuses, and 100 Mb/s FDDI local area networks for local distribution at each campus.

Reference-contexts: Providing location transparent services across a network is a problem which can be addressed at multiple levels, from the data-link layer to the application layer. In <ref> [CP92] </ref> we provide a survey of issues related to this problem as well as a set of existing and proposed solutions.

Reference-contexts: We believe that operating systems design must shift from the traditional focus of managing CPU cycles to that of managing I/O channel bandwidth which is increasingly becoming the scarce resource <ref> [P92] </ref>. We are investigating I/O system software architectures which support fast I/O switching of communication resources (e.g. the system bus) to support multiple I/O streams with time-varying bandwidth requirements and other real-time constraints.

Reference-contexts: Of course, the difficult part is to make the scheme operate without undue complexity and external intelligence or intervention, and also to guarantee that no traffic is lost during the transients. We present this design in <ref> [KPP92] </ref> together with some initial performance results which support our expectations for fairness, in terms of both throughput and delay.

Reference-contexts: We have recently initiated an NSF-sponsored effort to characterize and model the traffic on the NSFNET backbone and other wide area network environments <ref> [B+92] </ref>. Unlike other similar projects, our goal is to model the network as a whole rather than characterizing network performance as perceived by an application. This approach focuses on the integrity of the network, and tools and methodologies to facilitate its graceful evolution.

Reference-contexts: We applied co-adaptive decision-making to the problem of distributed job scheduling in a distributed computer system, and found this to be effective in load balancing <ref> [GP92] </ref>. Finally, we are considering how agents dynamically form groups such that these groups are more effective in solving problems than independent agents.
