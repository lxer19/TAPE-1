Title: DOMAIN DECOMPOSITION: A BLOWUP PROBLEM AND THE GINZBURG-LANDAU EQUATIONS

Abstract: In two of our recent projects, the technique of domain decomposition plays a crucial role in the numerical integration of the partial differential equations. In our problems, the local behavior varies because of the nonlinear and singular nature of the equations. Attempts to introduce different length scales did not lead to improvement. We found that different forms of the equations have to be used over different subdomains. The first project arises in an effort to determine the profile at the moment of blowup or quenching of a nonlinear heat equation. The second project arises in the investigation of the Ginzburg-Landau equation in the theory of superconductivity.

Reference-contexts: The experiments show that U develops some sort of a boundary layer in which U x assumes very large values. To improve accuracy, we use a five-point numerical differentiation formula to approximate U x . In our initial experiments, we used a uniform grid partitioning <ref> [0; 1] </ref> into 49 or 99 grid points. We integrate the system of Equations (11) over time intervals of size k = t n+1 t n . As is well known, the system is stiff and requires special techniques such as the Crank-Nicholson and other implicit methods. <p> Yet all attempts to completely eliminate the "horns" failed. We then overhauled the programs to deal with very general nonuniform grids. We used grids 9 that became progressively finer towards the endpoints: we started with 20 uniformly spaced grid points in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, subdivided the first and last intervals into 10 subintervals, and repeatedly subdivided the resulting first and last intervals. Our program includes a subroutine to compute the coefficients for a nonuniform four-point finite difference formula. <p> Identify two suitable subdomains that contain the boundary layers. In our experiments, we used [0; 0:1] and [0.9,1]. Based on the value of U at t n , compute the solution in [0:1; 0:9] at the new time step t n+1 by integrating (11) over the entire domain <ref> [0; 1] </ref> using the method described above and discarding the part in the boundary layers. Solve the original equation (1) over each of the boundary layers, requiring that the solution be continuous across the common boundary point of the subdomains. <p> For type-II superconductors, characterized by the fact that &gt; 1= p 2, Abrikosov <ref> [1] </ref> showed analytically, by using singular perturbation techniques, the existence of solutions that exhibited a lattice pattern. 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 6 8 Fig. 5. Vortex lattice magnetic field. <p> Although asymptotics does not seem to have played an explicit role in our discussion, it is instrumental in guiding us to choose the correct transformation needed in our first example and in the analytical work that Abrikosov did in <ref> [1] </ref>. Without the asymptotic results, no one would have ever guessed the lattice structure of vortices and the modified periodic form of the boundary conditions. Future work will include three-dimensional domains, more general nonlinear terms, and more realistic refinements of the various models.

Reference-contexts: There are so many papers on the subject that it is impossible to cite them all; a substantial number of references can be found in the monograph by Bebernes and Eberly <ref> [2] </ref>. The survey paper by Friedman and McLeod [13] discusses blowup phenomena for higher-order parabolic equations and hyperbolic equations. Blowup has also been observed in solutions of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation; see, for example, Landman et al. [21].

Reference-contexts: No similar work has been done on the quenching problem yet. Recently, Bellout <ref> [3] </ref> proposed a new approach based on a change of variable, which is inspired by known asymptotic results for the solutions. The method avoids the costly rescaling. <p> If the 4 conjecture is true, then (9) is a regular parabolic equation, and classical methods of integration can be applied with no difficulty up to the blowup time. In an attempt towards settling the conjecture, Bellout proved in <ref> [3] </ref> a useful regularity result in the one-dimensional case for (1) with p &gt; 5, which implies that v x is bounded for p &gt; 5.

Reference-contexts: The only systematic numerical study of the profile in the vicinity of the blowup time that we are aware of is the rescaling algorithm proposed by Berger and Kohn <ref> [4] </ref>, based on the asymptotic results obtained in Giga and Kohn [15].

Reference-contexts: BEHAVIOR NEAR BLOWUP There is a great deal of interest in the asymptotic behavior of the solution of (1) and (3) near the blowup time, stimulated by the classical work of Giga and Kohn [15]. Papers by Bressan <ref> [5, 6] </ref>, Filippas and Kohn [11], and Herrero and Velazquez [16] are only a small sample of the more recent work on the subject. It is interesting to note that similar work on the quenching problem is lacking.

Reference-contexts: It has also been realized that domain decomposition is sometimes called for because the problem has rich local structures; see, for example, the remarks by Chin and Hedstrom in <ref> [7] </ref>. Problems involving multiple scales belong to this category. We have given in this article two new examples in which the technique of domain decomposition forces its way into the numerical treatment of the problems.
