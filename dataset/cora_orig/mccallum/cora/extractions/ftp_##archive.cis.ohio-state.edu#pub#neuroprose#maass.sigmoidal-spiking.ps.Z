Title: An Efficient Implementation of Sigmoidal Neural Nets in Temporal Coding with Noisy Spiking Neurons

Abstract: We show that networks of relatively realistic mathematical models for biological neurons can in principle simulate arbitrary feedforward sigmoidal neural nets in a way which has previously not been considered. This new approach is based on temporal coding by single spikes (respectively by the timing of synchronous firing in pools of neurons), rather than on the traditional interpretation of analog variables in terms of firing rates. The resulting new simulation is substantially faster and hence more consistent with experimental results about the maximal speed of information processing in cortical neural systems. As a consequence we can show that networks of noisy spiking neurons are "universal approximators" in the sense that they can approximate with regard to temporal coding any given continuous function of several variables. This result holds for a fairly large class of schemes for coding analog variables by firing times of spiking neurons. Our new proposal for the possible organization of computations in networks of spiking neurons systems has some interesting consequences for the type of learning rules that would be needed to explain the self-organization of such networks. Finally, our fast and noise-robust implementation of sigmoidal neural nets via temporal coding points to possible new ways of implementing feedforward and recurrent sigmoidal neural nets with pulse stream VLSI.

The firing time t v of neuron v is then replaced by the mean firing time of neurons in P v , and an EPSP from v is replaced by a sum of EPSP's from neurons in P v .

Reference-contexts: One should note that the existing results on neural coding, see (Rieke et al., 1996), only address the coding of time-series, i.e. of sequential analog inputs. However if further experiments would show for example that the input-dependent firing times in visual cortex, as reported in <ref> (Bair et al., 1994) </ref>, vary in a continuous (respectively piecewise continuous) manner in response to smooth changes of complex inputs, this would provide some support to the here considered style of theoretical models for analog computation with spiking neurons. Furthermore a biological realization of recurrent neural nets (e.g.

For biological neurons it is of course impossible to choose the parameter arbitrarily large. On the other hand the experiments of <ref> (Bryant and Segundo, 1976) </ref> as well as the recent experiments of (Mainen, Sejnowski, 1995) suggest that biological neuron do already exhibit very high precision in their firing times 16 if the slope of the membrane potential P v (t) at the time t when it crosses the firing threshold is moderately

Reference-contexts: defined by fl (y) = &gt; &lt; 0 ; if y &lt; 0 fl ; if y &gt; fl : As a model for a spiking neuron we take the common model of a leaky integrate and fire neuron with noise, respectively the somewhat more general spike response model of <ref> (Gerstner, van Hemmen, 1994) </ref>. The only specific assumption that is needed for the construction in this article is that postsynaptic potentials can be described (respectively approximated) by a linear function during some initial segment. <p> We consider in this article a biologically more realistic model, where as in <ref> (Gerstner, van Hemmen, 1994) </ref> the size of the difference P noisy v (t) fi noisy v (t t 0 ) just governs the probability that neuron v fires. <p> In comparison with other models for spiking neurons, this model is with regard to the types of noise that it allows more general than the models considered in <ref> (Gerstner, van Hemmen, 1994, and Maass, 1995) </ref>. On the other hand this model is somewhat less general than the one considered in (Maass, 1996a). After having defined our formal model, we can now explain the key mechanism of our constructions in a bit more detail.

Reference-contexts: There exists empirical evidence that some neural systems carry out in addition to a very fast "preliminary computation" a more thorough subsequent computation in terms of firing rates, which has the ability to integrate relevant contributions from several neural subsystems, but which takes several hundred ms longer <ref> (see, e.g. Heller et al., 1995) </ref>. So far it is not known whether there exists a biological neural system whose computational organization can be understood as an implementation of a sigmoidal neural net.

Reference-contexts: Rather we show that the abovementioned computational mechanism is robust with respect to various types of noise. A complementary approach for simulating artificial neural nets by spiking neurons with temporal coding has recently been proposed in <ref> (Hopfield, 1995) </ref>. Hopfield's construction yields basically a simulation of radial basis function ("RBF") units, where the weights of the RBF-units are stored in the delays between synapses and soma of a spiking neuron. <p> Such multi-layer pattern analysis is facilitated by the fact that the here considered neurons encode their output in the same way in which their input is encoded <ref> (in contrast to the approach in Hopfield, 1995) </ref>. One also gets in this way a very fast implementation of Linsker's network (Linsker, 1988) with spiking neurons in temporal coding. 3. For biological neurons it is of course impossible to choose the parameter arbitrarily large. <p> In a biological context they appear to be useful for providing to the network "a-priori information" about its computational task, so that Hebbian learning can be viewed as "fine-tuning" on top of this preprogrammed information. If there exist biological mechanisms for modulating such delays <ref> (see Hopfield, 1995, Kempter et al., 1996) </ref>, they would provide in addition to a short term memory via synaptic modulation a separate mechanism for storing and adapting long term memory via differences in the delays. 22 5 Conclusions We have shown in this article that there exists a rather simple way

Hence the time difference T i between the firing of the presynaptic and the postsynaptic neuron is in principle available to each synapse.

Reference-contexts: We have shown in this article that networks of spiking neurons with temporal coding have at least the same computational power as sigmoidal neural nets of roughly the same size and depth. Together with a recent separation result <ref> (Maass, 1996b) </ref> this implies that networks of spiking neurons have in fact strictly more computational power.

Reference-contexts: The same speed of visual processing has been measured by Rolls et al. in macaque monkeys. Furthermore they have shown that a single cortical area involved in visual processing can complete its computation in just 20-30 ms <ref> (Rolls, 1994a, 1994b) </ref>. On the other hand the firing rates of neurons involved in these computations are usually below 100 Hz, and hence at least 20-30 ms would be needed just to sample the current firing rate of a neuron.
