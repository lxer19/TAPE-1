Abstract: We have attempted to obtain a stronger correlation between the relationship between G 0 and G 1 and performance. This has included studying the variance in the fitnesses of the members of the population, as well as observing the rate of convergence of the GP with respect to G 1 when a population was evolved for G 0 . 13 Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to obtain a significant correlation. In future work, we plan to to track the genetic diversity (we have only considered phenotypic variance so far) of populations in order to shed some light on the underlying mechanism for priming. One factor that has made this analysis difficult so far is our use of genetic programming, for which the space of genotypes is very large, (i.e., there are many redundant solutions), and for which the neighborhood structure is less easily intuited than that of a standard genetic algorithm. Since there is every reason to believe that the underlying mechanism of incremental evolution is largely independent of the peculiarities of genetic programming, we are currently investigating the incremental evolution mechanism using genetic algorithms with fixed-length genotypes. This should enable a better understanding of the mechanism. Ultimately, we will scale up this research effort to analyze incremental evolution with more than one transition between test cases. This will involve many open issues regarding the optimization of the transition schedule between test cases. 13 We performed the following experiment: Let F it(I; G) be the fitness value of a genetic program I according to the evaluation function G, and Best Of(P op; t; G) be the member I fl of population P op at time t with highest fitness according to G | in other words, I fl = Best Of (P op; t; G) maximizes F it(I; G) over all I 2 P op. A population P op 0 was evolved in the usual manner using evaluation function G 0 for t = 25 generations. However, at each generation 1 i 25 we also evaluated the current population using evaluation function G 1 , and recorded the value of F it(Best Of (P op; i; G 1 ); G 1 ). In other words, we evolved the population using G 0 as the evaluation function, but at every generation we also computed the fitness of the best individual in the population according to G 1 and saved this value. Using the same random seed and control parameters, we then evolved a population P op 1 for t = 30 generations using G 1 as the evaluation function (note that at generation 0, P op 1 is identical to P op 0 ). For all values of t, we compared F it(Best Of (P op 0 ; t; G 1 ); G 1 ) with F it(Best Of (P op 1 ; t; G 1 ); G 1 ). in order to better formalize and exploit this notion of domain difficulty.
