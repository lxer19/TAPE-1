Abstract: The representation languages found in many expert system shells are hybrids composed of a frame language and a rule language. Unfortunately, the frame and rule components in these systems are not well integrated, and as a result they miss important classes of inferences. In place of frames, LOOM combines a description language with a rule language, and uses an inference engine called a classifier to achieve a successful integration of frame-like knowledge and rule-like knowledge. LOOM's ability to reason with descriptions enables us to implement a broader range of capabilities than those found in the current generation of expert system shells. For example, LOOM is able to detect inconsistencies in a rule base, to match against partially-specified (not fully-grounded) instances, and it implements a generalization of the traditional (e.g., CLOS-like) conception of object-oriented method dispatching.

Reference-contexts: The idea of combining rules with descriptions in the manner just described is a relatively recent innovation within the field of classification-based KR systems, but it seems to be gaining quick acceptance within that community. CLASSIC <ref> [BBMR89] </ref> and MESON [OK88] are examples of other KR systems that have adopted the same approach.

Reference-contexts: These additional kinds of inference extend considerably beyond simple inheritance. This additional deductive power enables LOOM to provide capabilities not found in current generation KR tools. LOOM had its genesis in the KL-ONE-family <ref> [BS85] </ref> of taxonomic representation languages. LOOM is designed to support the construction of intelligent software applications. It promotes a "model-based" approach to programming wherein the core of an application program is a (dynamically changing) knowledge base of definitions, rules, and facts that collectively define the state of a domain model.

Reference-contexts: This kind of reasoning is being exploited by a natural language parsing application that is being implemented using LOOM <ref> [Kas89] </ref>. In that application, a significant percentage of the semantic knowledge that attaches to terms in a sentence takes the form of disjunctive descriptions. Especially in the early stages of parsing, significant benefits (manifested by a reduction in the search space) arise whenever the process of unification resolves an ambiguity.

Reference-contexts: The significant difference is that LOOM finds important classes of inference (as illustrated in this paper) that these other systems miss. 4 See the discussion in <ref> [Kni89, pages 105-108] </ref> on unifying feature structures.

Reference-contexts: Second, the dispatcher prefers methods tied to more specific types/classes over methods attached to more general types. LOOM generalizes traditional method dispatching by permitting an arbitrary pattern to be associated with each method <ref> [MY88] </ref>. When a generic function is called in LOOM, the LOOM method dispatcher eliminates all methods whose patterns are not satisfied when their free variables are bound to the actual parameters.

Reference-contexts: The notions of description, definition, subsumption, and classification as presented in this paper have become standard within the "terminological logic" community <ref> [PS + 90] </ref>. Not yet standard is our thesis that description unification (performed by a classifier) should play the same role in reasoning with a description-plus-rule language that ordinary (syntactic) unification plays in reasoning with a relation-based logic.

Reference-contexts: By substituting these names in place of references to their sets of conditions, the sizes of rules (measured in num-bers of conditions) can often be substantially reduced.

Reference-contexts: In LOOM, a method is preferred over another when the pattern attached to the former method specializes the pattern attached to the latter method. <ref> [Yen90] </ref> describes how classifier technology can be extended to compute subsumption relations between patterns. Thus, LOOM's generalization of the method dispatching paradigm is predicated on the availability of a classifier. 7 Discussion Much of the technology described in this paper is not unique to LOOM [Mac90].
