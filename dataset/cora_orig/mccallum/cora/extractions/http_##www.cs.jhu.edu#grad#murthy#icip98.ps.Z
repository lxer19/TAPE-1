Title: Automatic Collimation in Peripheral X-ray Imaging

Abstract: A method has been developed using which the foreground (body) in a fluoroscopy image of the peripherals can be segmented from the background (existing collima-tion and direct exposure). The extracted information about where the body is in an image is used to suggest settings for the collimator hardware during image acquisition. Segmentation is achieved through global feature extraction and supervised classification.

Reference-contexts: The supervised decision tree methods used for classification [2] have an additional advantage that they indicate which features are the most useful for discrimination. These and traditional feature selection methods <ref> [1] </ref> indicated that there was no improvement in the classification results by adding more features to the above set.

Reference-contexts: We started out with several other features such as the size of a region, the location of a region with respect to this station and with respect to the full-leg study, the variance of intensities in the region, etc. The supervised decision tree methods used for classification <ref> [2] </ref> have an additional advantage that they indicate which features are the most useful for discrimination. These and traditional feature selection methods [1] indicated that there was no improvement in the classification results by adding more features to the above set. <p> We constructed binary decision trees with the popular Classification and Regression Trees (CART) method. A complete description of the CART methodology is beyond the scope of this paper. (See <ref> [2] </ref>.) For the sake of completeness, we summarize its salient points here. The CART method takes as input a collection of labeled training instances, each instance having some attributes and a class label and produces a hierarchical decision tree as output.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, without collimation, the direct exposure of x-rays to the image intensifier could damage the device and produce diagnostically useless images. A typical current peripheral angiography study of the legs requires three full scans from abdominal to distal foot region <ref> [3] </ref>. Each scan consists of taking images at several stations (positions) along the leg. First, the fluoroscopic control scan allows the physician to check individual stations, measure patient transparency and manually set the collimator.

Reference-contexts: Their method, based on statistical models of collimated regions and edges, is highly accurate. Researchers at Eastman Kodak have worked on the problem of skin tone scale improvement. Two sub-problems they consider are collimation detection <ref> [4] </ref> and skin line detection [6], the later being related to finding direct exposure regions. Kodak's algorithms for skin tone adjustment have been clinically validated. The above works deal with computed radiography images, which are very different from fluoroscopy images.

Reference-contexts: Finding boundaries accurately and efficiently is crucial in our application. The subsequent steps of global feature extraction and clas sification rely on this information. We discovered that directional negative curvature points along line profiles of intensity are a reliable indicator of low-contrast boundaries <ref> [5] </ref>. Even for very low contrast or hazy soft-tissue boundaries, there exist well defined points of negative curvature on the line profiles of intensity. Negative curvatures of intensity profiles can also be computed very efficiently.

Reference-contexts: A few researchers have considered the problem of segmenting the foreground and background in computed radiography x-ray images. Zhang and Huang <ref> [7] </ref> address the problem of collimation recognition and removal, to improve the display of x-ray images in a Picture Archival and Communication System (PACS). Their method, based on statistical models of collimated regions and edges, is highly accurate.
