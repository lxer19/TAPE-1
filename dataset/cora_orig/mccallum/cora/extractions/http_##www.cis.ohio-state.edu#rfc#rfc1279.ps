Abstract: This RFCconsiders X.500 in relation to Internet and UK Domains. A basic model of X.500 providing a higher level and more descriptive naming structure is emphasised. In addition, a mapping of domains onto X.500 is proposed, which gives a range of new management and user facilities over and above those currently available. This specification proposes an experimental new mechanism to access and manage domain information on the Internet and in the UK Academic Community. There is no current intention to provide an operational replacement for DNS.

Reference-contexts: The manager attribute is defined in the COSINE and Internet naming architecture Hardcastle-Kille Page 4 RFC 1279 X.500 and Domains November 1991 <ref> [BHK91] </ref>. It allows a manager to be associated with the domain, which is useful where the manager of the domain is different to the manager of the object defined by the AssociatedName. This will allow any domain to be represented in an X.500 hierarchy. <p> This attribute is defined in the Cosine and Internet Naming Architecture <ref> [BHK91] </ref>. Conversely, there are pointers from the DNS represented tree into the or-ganisational X.500 DIT: AssociatedName ATTRIBUTE WITH ATTRIBUTE-SYNTAX distinguishedNameSyntax This attribute is associated with the Domain object class. This entry is used to provide linkage from the DNS X.500 Hierarchy into the organisational X.500 hierarchy. <p> A possible approach to this experimentation is described in Appendix A. Object Identifiers have been assigned for this purpose in the Cosine and Internet Naming Architecture <ref> [BHK91] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: RFC 822 mailbox names are closely related [Cro82]. For example: &lt;S.Kille@CS.UCL.AC.UK&gt; The local-part of the RFC 822 mailbox can be considered as one level lower in the domain hierarchy. 2 X.500 The OSI Directory, usually known as X.500, provides a very general naming framework <ref> [CCI88] </ref>. A basic usage of X.500 is to provide Organisationally Structured Names. A Schema for this is defined within the standard. Name components will typically have longish values.

Reference-contexts: Example domains are: MIT.EDU VENERA.ISI.EDU CS.UCL.AC.UK Entries usually have a single name, although pointers to entries (not sub-trees) may be provided by CNAME records. Information (resource records) is associated with each entry. Name components are typically chosen to be shortish (e.g., "CS"). RFC 822 mailbox names are closely related <ref> [Cro82] </ref>. For example: &lt;S.Kille@CS.UCL.AC.UK&gt; The local-part of the RFC 822 mailbox can be considered as one level lower in the domain hierarchy. 2 X.500 The OSI Directory, usually known as X.500, provides a very general naming framework [CCI88].

Reference-contexts: Name components will typically have longish values. This is an example directory name represented in Tabular form: Country GB Organisation University College London Organisational Unit Computer Science Common Name Stephen E. Hardcastle-Kille This can also be written in the "User Friendly Name" notation defined in <ref> [HK91] </ref>. This syntax is used for names in the rest of this document: Stephen E. Hardcastle-Kille, Computer Science, University College London, GB This type of structure is termed "organisational X.500". This is a subset of the general capabilities.

Reference-contexts: 1 The Domain Name System The Domain (Nameserver) System (DNS) provides a hierarchical resource labelling system [Moc87a] [Moc87b] <ref> [Lar83] </ref>. Example domains are: MIT.EDU VENERA.ISI.EDU CS.UCL.AC.UK Entries usually have a single name, although pointers to entries (not sub-trees) may be provided by CNAME records. Information (resource records) is associated with each entry. Name components are typically chosen to be shortish (e.g., "CS"). <p> Inverse information can be derived by the usual IN-ADDR domain, which will be represented in the same manner in the DIT. 8 NRS Information Information associated with the UK NRS (Name Registration Scheme) can be handled in a similar manner <ref> [Lar83] </ref>. This is being developed in a separate document by Alan Turland.

Reference-contexts: This may be useful for the user to determine information about a message originator. * This technique may be useful to facilitate introduction of security, as it will enable certificates to be associated with domains and mailboxes.

Reference-contexts: This grouping can facilitate management of networks. The subclass IPNetwork mandates linkage into the DNS part of the DIT. This will be represented in the DIT using the structures of RFC 1101 <ref> [Moc89] </ref>. Both of the domains which identify the network should be represented in the Object Class. For example, a network might have the (user friendly) name: UCL-Ethernet, University College London, GB This would have associated domains 0.0.40.128.IN-ADDR.ARPA and UCL-ETHERNET.UCL.AC.UK. These would both have the analogous DIT representations.
