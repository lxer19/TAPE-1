Abstract: In a previous paper [3], one of the authors, gave a worst-case analysis for the Early Packet Discard (EPD) technique for maintaining packet integrity during overload in ATM switches. This analysis showed that to ensure 100% goodput during overload under worst-case conditions, requires a buffer with enough storage for one maximum length packet from every active virtual circuit. This paper refines that analysis, using assumptions that are closer to what we expect to see in practice and examines how EPD performs when the buffer is not large enough to achieve 100% goodput. We show that 100% goodput can be achieved with substantially smaller buffers than predicted by the worst-case analysis, although the required buffer space can be significant when the link speed is substantially higher than the rate of the individual virtual circuits. We also show that high goodputs can be achieved with more modest buffer sizes, but that EPD exhibits anomalies with respect to buffer capacity, in that there are situations in which increasing the amount of buffering can cause the goodput to decrease. These results are validated by comparison with simulation.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we focus on a mechanism that accepts that cell loss will occur, but attempts to ensure that the available network capacity is effectively utilized by preserving the integrity of transport level packets during overload periods. Early packet discard (EPD) <ref> [1] </ref> is an ATM buffer management technique designed ensure high end-to-end throughputs for bursty data applications during overload periods. EPD achieves this by observing the packet-level structure of each cell stream and discarding entire packets, when overload makes it necessary to do so.

Reference-contexts: EPD is only one of several mechanisms that have been proposed for handling congestion in ATM networks. In particular, rate-based flow control has now been standardized by the ATM Forum to manage congestion for Available Bit Rate (ABR) traffic streams <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A previous paper <ref> [3] </ref> analyzes several packet level discard mechanisms including EPD. That analysis is based on worst-case assumptions that over-state the amount of buffering required for high effective throughputs. <p> From this discussion, we can see that the maximum excursion above the threshold is U = 2 r ` rk1 X (r k i) = (1=2)(r k) 2 (`=r) 6 Casoni and Turner Note that this implies U (k=4)`. By the worst-case analysis given in <ref> [3] </ref>, the maximum excursion above the threshold can be (r k)`, which is always at least four times larger than the "even offset" analysis predicts. To determine the excursion below the threshold, we need to know the number of active virtual circuits at the downward threshold crossing. <p> The maximum value of u is thus (2 p 3)k` :27k`. The worst-case analysis in <ref> [3] </ref> gives a maximum excursion below threshold of k`. The total buffer range is thus, U + u = k (r k)(`=r) and since k &lt; r &lt; 2k, the buffer range is k` 2 . <p> Thus, the total excursion above the threshold is: U = ` + r i=1 When r ! 1, U ! k` so U lies within the range h 4 ; k` . Adding u and U gives a total buffer range of (r k)k (`=r). The worst-case analysis of <ref> [3] </ref> gives a maximum buffer range of r`. 4.2. Buffer Overflow Without Underflow When we have large overbooking ratios, we observe somewhat different behavior than with small overbooking ratios. <p> With smaller buffers, it is subject to degraded goodput at small to medium overloads, but for heavy overloads, the goodput rises to an asymptotic value ensuring that congestion collapse is avoided. Reference <ref> [3] </ref> describes variants of EPD that provide both better performance and provide more nearly fair treatment of different virtual circuits.
