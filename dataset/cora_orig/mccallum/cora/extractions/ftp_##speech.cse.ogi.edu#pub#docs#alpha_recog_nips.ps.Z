Abstract: The recognition system described in this paper classifies letters of the English alphabet produced by any speaker over telephone lines at 89% accuracy for spelled alphabets and retrieves names from a list of 50,000 with 91% first choice accuracy. The system has a number of characteristic features. We represent speech using an auditory model|Perceptual Linear Predictive (PLP) analysis. We perform explicit segmentation of the speech signal into phonetic categories. Explicit segmentation allows us to use segment durations to discriminate letters, and to extract features from specific regions of the signal. Finally, speech knowledge is used to design a set of features that work best for English letters. We are currently analyzing errors made by our system. The great advantage of our approach is that individual errors can be analyzed, and individual features can be added to improve performance. [COLE 91] R. A. Cole, M. Fanty, M. Gopalakrishnan, and R.
