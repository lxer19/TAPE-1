Abstract: 3 The work described in this paper was done while the third author was an employee of Carnegie Mellon University Abstract In theory, speech recognition technology can make any spoken words in video or audio media usable for text indexing, search and retrieval. This article describes the News-on-Demand application created within the Informedia TM Digital Video Library project and discusses how speech recognition is used in transcript creation from video, alignment with closed-captioned transcripts, audio paragraph segmentation and a spoken query interface. Speech recognition accuracy varies dramatically depending on the quality and type of data used. Informal information retrieval tests show that reasonable recall and precision can be obtained with only moderate speech recognition accuracy. This paper is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation, DARPA and NASA under NSF Cooperative agreement No. IRI-9411299.
