Title: Edge-connectivity Augmentation with Partition Constraints  
Author: Jtrgen Bang-Jensen Harold N. Gabow Tibor Jordan Zoltan Szigeti 
Abstract: In the well-solved edge-connectivity augmentation problem we must find a minimum cardinality set F of edges to add to a given undirected graph to make it k-edge-connected. This paper solves the generalization where every edge of F must go between two different sets of a given partition of the vertex set. A special case of this partition-constrained problem, previously unsolved, is increasing the edge-connectivity of a bipartite graph to k while preserving bipartiteness. Based on this special case we present an application of our results in statics. Our solution to the general partition-constrained problem gives a min-max formula for jF j which includes as a special case the original min-max formula of Cai and Sun [4] for the problem without partition constraints. When k is even the min-max formula for the partition-constrained problem is a natural generalization of [4]. However this generalization fails when k is odd. We show that at most one more edge is needed when k is odd and we characterize the graphs that require such an extra edge. We give a strongly polynomial algorithm that solves our problem in time O(n(m + n log n) log n). Here n and m denote the number of vertices and distinct edges of the given graph respectively. This bound is identical to the best-known time bound for the problem without partition constraints. Our algorithm is based on the splitting off technique of Lovasz, like several known efficient algorithms for the unconstrained problem. However unlike previous splitting algorithms, when k is odd our algorithm must handle "obstacles" that prevent all edges from being split off. Our algorithm is of interest even when specialized to the unconstrained problem, because it produces an asymptotically optimum number of distinct splits.

Let k be even and let G = (V + s; E) be a graph satisfying (2.1) with d (s) even. <p> We present an algorithm that runs in time O (n (m + n log n) log n s ).

The difference is that it uses contraction as the basic operation. <p> The main advantage of our approach is that it can be extended to find a complete allowed splitting for odd k. (Both algorithms can be so extended for even k.) In addition there is a slight efficiency advantage: The algorithm of <ref> [17] </ref> finds a complete splitting with O (n s log n s ) distinct splits. Our splitting contains O (n s ) distinct splits, the asymptotically optimum number. This implies fewer distinct edges get added to the graph. <p> Our splitting contains O (n s ) distinct splits, the asymptotically optimum number. This implies fewer distinct edges get added to the graph. It improves the space bound, from O (m+n s log n s ) to O (m). Also while the time bound of <ref> [17] </ref> for k even is the same as our bound, for k odd it is our bound with log n s changed to log n (so in some cases our algorithm is slightly faster). We omit the details of this algorithm from this paper. <p> This problem is NP-hard even for k = 2. Acknowledgments The authors gratefully thank Andras Frank.
