Abstract: We previously introduced an exemplar model, named GCM-ISW, that exploits a highly flexible weighting scheme. Our simulations showed that it records faster learning rates and higher asymptotic accuracies on several artificial categorization tasks than models with more limited abilities to warp input spaces. This paper extends our previous work; it describes experimental results that suggest human subjects also invoke such highly flexible schemes. In particular, our model provides significantly better fits than models with less flexibility, and we hypothesize that humans selectively weight attributes depending on an item's location in the input space. We need more flexible models Many theories of human concept learning posit that concepts are represented by prototypes (Reed, 1972) or exemplars (Medin & Schaffer, 1978). Prototype models represent concepts by the "best example" or "central tendency" of the concept. 1 A new item belongs in a category C if it is relatively similar to C's prototype. Prototype models are relatively inflexible; they discard a great deal of information that people use during concept learning (e.g., the number of exemplars in a concept (Homa & Cultice, 1984), the variability of features (Fried & Holyoak, 1984), correlations between features (Medin et al., 1982), and the particular exemplars used (Whittlesea, 1987)). of concept learning

Reference-contexts: We further augmented this learning model to include exemplar-specific weights; each exemplar in each concept was given its own set of attribute weights <ref> (Aha & Goldstone, 1990) </ref>. This new model, named GCM-ISW, achieved faster learning rates and higher asymptotic performance than other models on artificial categorization tasks whose concepts were best modeled by using context-sensitive settings for attribute weights. <p> Simulations on weighting attributes Three exemplar-based process models were evaluated in simulations for their ability to fit the subjects' responses. These models, GCM-NW, GCM-SW, and GCM-ISW, were previously described in <ref> (Aha & Goldstone, 1990) </ref>, are all derived from Nosofsky's (1986) Generalized Context Model (GCM), and differ only in how they weight attribute dimensions. The least flexible, GCM-NW, weights all attributes equally.

Reference-contexts: 1 Other summary information may also be stored by more advanced prototype models; our concerns primarily target problems with "pure" prototype models. More accurately, we are interested in supporting the learning behavior displayed by the advanced exemplar models described in Section 3 regardless of the models' representation for categories <ref> (Barsalou, 1989) </ref>. a category C if it is relatively similar to C's known exemplars. Exemplar representations are far more flexible than prototype representations since they retain sensitivity to all of the information listed above. This flexibility often translates to increased categorization accuracy.

Reference-contexts: Exemplar representations are far more flexible than prototype representations since they retain sensitivity to all of the information listed above. This flexibility often translates to increased categorization accuracy. For example, unlike prototype models, humans and exemplar models can learn some non-linearly separable categories as easily as linearly separable categories <ref> (Medin & Schwanenflugel, 1981) </ref>. This capability is not limited to flat learning architectures; several researchers capture this flexibility in radial basis networks (e.g., Kruschke, 1992; Hurwitz, 1991). While existing exemplar models are more flexible than prototype models, they are still not sufficiently flexible.

Reference-contexts: Weights are initially equal and their settings are updated after each training item is presented via a strategy akin to the delta rule <ref> (Rumelhart, McClelland, & the PDP Research Group, 1986) </ref>. 2 Finally, GCM-ISW's function f combines the category-specific weight settings learned by GCM-SW with a separate set of weight settings stored with exemplar y.
