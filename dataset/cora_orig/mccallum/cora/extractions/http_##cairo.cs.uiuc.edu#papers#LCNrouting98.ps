Abstract: We propose an integrated QoS routing framework based on selective probing for high-speed packet-switching networks. The framework is fully distributed and depends only on the local state maintained at every individual node. By using controlled diffusion computations, the framework captures the common messaging and computational structure of distributed QoS routing, and allows an efficient implementation due to its simplicity. Different distributed routing algorithms (DRAs) can be quickly developed by specifying only a few well-defined constraint-dependent parameters within the framework. Our simulation shows that the overhead of the proposed algorithms is stable and modest.

Reference-contexts: Second, the link-state algorithm commonly used in the source routing can only provide approximate global state due to the overhead concern and non-negligible propagation delay of state messages. The inaccuracy in the global state may cause the QoS routing fail. Third, the link-state algorithm has the scalability problem <ref> [1] </ref>. It is impractical for any single node to have access to detailed state information about all nodes and all links in large networks. The hierarchical routing is used as a solution [5]. However, the state aggregation increases the level of inaccuracy [6].

Reference-contexts: A distributed QoS routing framework is proposed in Section 3, from which a family of unicast routing algorithms are derived in Section 4. Simulation results are presented in in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper. An early version of this paper can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. 2 Network and QoS Models A network is modeled as a set V of nodes that are interconnected by a set E of communication links. Each node i has a routing table that has an entry R i (t) for every possible destination t. <p> Theorem 1 If the generic DRA establishes a connection, the path of the connection must be loop-free. Due to space limitation, we leave out the proof of all theorems. Interested readers can find the proof in <ref> [2] </ref>. 3.4 Complexity analysis The algorithm takes a single message round-trip time to establish a connection. <p> The message overhead of DRA (bandwidth), DRA (delay) and their iterative versions will be presented. The results for other DRAs can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. We use DRA (fl) ITERATIVE as an abbreviation of DRA (fl) ITERATIVE ON fL = d s;t ; L = +1g. DRA (bandwidth) and DRA (bandwidth) ITERATIVE on NET-1 and NET-2. The message overhead is plotted with respect to the average traffic load in the network.

Reference-contexts: We also discuss several optimization techniques which improve the routing performance. In addition, we describe a heuristic solution to the NP-complete multi-constrained routing problem. Our framework supports multicast routing as well, which was presented in <ref> [3] </ref>. The most related work is done by Shin and Chou [10] and by Hou [7] 1 . Their flooding-based distributed algorithms also rely on local states for routing, but only the delay metric is considered and a large number of routing messages are required.

Reference-contexts: In the distributed routing, the path is computed by a distributed computation during which control messages are exchanged among the nodes and the state information kept at each node is collectively used in order to find a path. The source routing scheme <ref> [4, 6, 8] </ref> has several problems. <p> The first probe reaching the destination defines the path, which however may not be the optimal one. When there exist many paths that satisfy the QoS requirement, the shortest path in terms of number of hops is often desired due to a better statistical performance <ref> [8] </ref>. We propose iterative DRAs to find the shortest tentative path. As an example, let us design an iterative version of DRA (bandwidth) first. We define the age of a probe p as the number of hops it has traveled. 8 Initially, age (p) := 0.

Reference-contexts: In the distributed routing, the path-selection computation is distributed among the intermediate nodes between the source and the destination. Hence, the routing response time can be made shorter and the algorithm is more scalable. However, most existing distributed routing algorithms <ref> [9, 11] </ref> still require each node to maintain a global network state, based on which the routing decision is made on a hop-by-hop basis. The routing performance heavily depends on the accuracy of the global state. Therefore, these algorithms more or less share the same problem of the source routing.

Wang and Crowcroft <ref> [11] </ref> proved that if Qos contains at least two additive metrics then the routing is a NP-complete problem. 3 Distributed QoS Routing Framework Our distributed QoS routing framework defines a protocol for exchanging routing messages among nodes, and provides a common basis for distributed QoS routing regardless the specific metrics involved. <p> The overhead of failure-and-retry is not included. 4.1.2 Optimization When there exist many paths that satisfy the QoS requirement, the shortest path in terms of delay or number of hops or the widest path in terms of residual bandwidth <ref> [11] </ref> is often preferred. However, DRA (bandwidth) finds a tentative path blindly through the competition among probes. Whichever probe reaching the destination first defines the path.
