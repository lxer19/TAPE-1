Abstract: This paper presents an inferential system based on abductive interpretation of text. Inference to the best explanation is performed by the recognition of the most economic semantic paths produced by the propagation of markers on a very large linguistic knowledge base. The propagation of markers is controlled by their intrinsic propagation rules, devised from plausible semantic relation chains. An interpretation is inferred whenever two markers collide. The trajectories of the two colliding markers represent the abductive tree, where each marker propagation stands for an implication from the knowledge base. Markers propagate semantic constrains throughout the knowledge base, evaluating the plausibility of each inference. Using a very large knowledge base, our inferential system aims at producing interpretations accountable for commonsense reasoning. The novelty is that the inference rules model a large variety of implications, as suggested by the knowledge base relations. Textual implicatures are recognized as pragmatic inferences.

Reference-contexts: They may be further combined to generate more complex rules. Since the relations we use are unambiguous, the inference rules are unambiguous. The rules may be more or less plausible, but are not a source of ambiguity, unlike the plausible inference rules in <ref> [COL88] </ref>. Table 2) that link three concepts. They are separated by columns according to the parts of speech they connect. For example, the relation pairs from the first column connect serially 7 three verb concepts V C 1 , V C 2 and V C 3 .

Reference-contexts: It is althought a novel implementation of an abductive method of inference, different than that proposed in <ref> [HSAM93] </ref>. A thorough analysis of each inference rule is required in order to understand its general applicability. Although we have identified some factors that affect plausibility, there are some other sources, such as the nature of the relations, that need to be explored.

Reference-contexts: CCR-9406998. The implementation of PARIS uses the MPN (Marker Propagation Networks) approach <ref> [LHHM94] </ref>, a highly parallel, process flow paradigm, evolved from previous SNAP experiments [MLL92]. Inference patterns are procedurally mapped into marker propagation rules, while linguistic constraints are active data spread between nodes, links and markers. Markers are processes, traveling along predetermined inference patterns and checking linguistic constraints along the way.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, ball and bat are tagged as nouns. Then polysemous words are disambiguated. The process of selecting the appropriate meaning of each word is performed against the information provided by a semantic knowledge base. For example, the verb hit in WordNet 1.5 <ref> [Mil95] </ref> has 14 senses: [ to cause to move by striking ], [ to collide with something ], [ to deal a blow to something ], [ reach a destination or a specific point or level ], [ to strike ], [ to shoot ], [ to stumble across ], [ <p> While researchers agree that large, scalable knowledge bases are needed to address realistic AI problems, there is little agreement on how to structure such knowledge bases. We decided to build our system on top of the WordNet1.5 lexical database <ref> [Mil95] </ref> developed at Princeton. WordNet is a semantic dictionary because words are searched based on conceptual affinity with other words. It covers the vast majority of nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs from the English language. The words in WordNet are organized in synonym sets, called synsets.

The implementation of PARIS uses the MPN (Marker Propagation Networks) approach [LHHM94], a highly parallel, process flow paradigm, evolved from previous SNAP experiments <ref> [MLL92] </ref>. Inference patterns are procedurally mapped into marker propagation rules, while linguistic constraints are active data spread between nodes, links and markers. Markers are processes, traveling along predetermined inference patterns and checking linguistic constraints along the way. Their propagation also depends on the knowledge base topology. <p> Reasoning on knowledge bases falls into this broad category. An SIMD implementation of a much simpler marker propagation model is the SNAP experimental computer <ref> [MLL92] </ref>. In this paper, we use a more powerful MIMD model that runs only on a simulator. The marker propagation model can be briefly described as a network consisting of nodes and links, and a set of markers moving through the network according to some propagation rules.
