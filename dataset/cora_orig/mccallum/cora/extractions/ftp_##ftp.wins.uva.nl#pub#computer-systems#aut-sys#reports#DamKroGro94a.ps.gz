Reference-contexts: This is useful in, e.g., sensor fusion applications, to correlate different representations of the same scene (see, e.g., <ref> [Gielen et al., 91] </ref>). Traditionally, local Hebbian learning is suggested to approach these problems. Here, it is proven, that if continuous-valued learning samples are available, the ffi-rule gives better performance. For binary-valued learning samples, it is shown that the Hebb rule does not converge to the optimal weight values.

Reference-contexts: Naturally, this measure can also be calculated if instead of the Hebb-rule, the ffi-rule is applied. If linear activation values are used, the ffi-rule takes w new i y i )x j and the variance in the ffi-rule is given by (see <ref> [Hammersley, Handscomb (1965)] </ref>): var [w ij + y fl i x j ] + var [y i x j ] 2cov [y fl So, if we can prove that 2cov [y fl i x j ; y i x j ] &gt; var [y i x j ], we may expect

Reference-contexts: And thus, if we are careful with the initialisation of the weights w ij , the ffi-rule can be expected to give better performance than the Hebb-rule. 3 Binary-valued Learning samples In some cases, we may only have binary-valued, non-linear learning samples (see <ref> [Van Dam et al., (1993)] </ref> for an example). In this case, the correlation between y fl i and x j is interpreted as: w fl We assume that all possible patterns are equally distributed, i.e., P (x j = 1) = 1 2 .

Reference-contexts: We have compared the ffi-rule to the Hebb rule in a similar way to section 2, but a fair comparison is difficult to make (see <ref> [Van Dam et al., (1994)] </ref>).
