Abstract: Research in discourse processing has identified two representational requirements for discourse planning systems. First, discourse plans must adequately represent the intentional structure of the utterances they produce in order to enable a computational discourse agent to respond effectively to communicative failures [15]. Second, discourse plans must represent the informational structure of utterances. In addition to these representational requirements, we argue that discourse planners should be formally characterizable in terms of soundness and completeness.

Reference-contexts: In addition to these representational requirements, we argue that discourse planners should meet certain computational requirements. Most current discourse planners are based on the original NOAH [20] model of hierarchical planning <ref> [1, 2, 9, 13, 15] </ref>. These systems rely on customized planning algorithms with procedural semantics for the purposes of solving specific text-planning problems. The informal construction of these systems and their application to particular problems have resulted in successful text generation for specific domains and text types. <p> However, the information about causal and decompositional relationships recorded in sound plans is crucial for determining where the planning model is in error and how to replan when an execution failure occurs. 4 Previous Discourse Planning Systems Most current discourse planners (e.g., <ref> [1, 2, 9, 13, 15] </ref>) are based on the original NOAH model of hierarchical planning. They rely on customized planning algorithms with procedural semantics for the purposes of solving specific text-planning problems, and thus their representations and algorithms suffer from being unprincipled and difficult to analyze.

In this plan there is no explicit connection between the effects established by the parent action (c4 and c5) and those established by its subplan (c6, c7, c9, c10, c12 and c13). <p> As a result, the formal properties of these planning algorithms are difficult to characterize. While a complete analysis of the planning algorithms used by previous systems <ref> [2, 9, 13, 15] </ref> is beyond the scope of this paper, several properties of these algorithms are straightforward to describe. First, these planners do not guarantee that a step's preconditions hold prior to the step's execution and thus they are not sound.

Reference-contexts: Given a model of planning where actions are related both causally and decompositionally, a sound planning algorithm must consider two factors when constructing plans. First, for every step in a plan, the planner must ensure that each precondition of that step will be true just prior to its execution <ref> [3] </ref>. Second, the planner must consider the manner in which the steps of a subplan achieve the goals of the parent [23, 25]. <p> As has been noted in <ref> [20, 3] </ref>, NOAH, and consequently those discourse planners based on it, use ad hoc procedures for the construction of plans. As a result, the formal properties of these planning algorithms are difficult to characterize.

Reference-contexts: Discourse interpretation requires that an agent be able to recognize the relationships between the information conveyed in consecutive elements of discourse (e.g., [7, 16]). Choosing syntactic structures and connective markers that convey these relationships requires that a discourse generator represent informational [19, 21, 22] as well as intentional <ref> [4] </ref> structure. Because there is not a fixed, one-to-one mapping between intentional and informational structures, discourse plans must include an explicit representation of both types of structure [15, 16]. In addition to these representational requirements, we argue that discourse planners should meet certain computational requirements.

Reference-contexts: The action operator captures the action's preconditions and effects, sets of first-order unquantified sentences similar to the typical precondition and add/delete lists of STRIPS <ref> [5] </ref>. Each decomposition operator represents a single-layer expansion of a composite step, essentially providing a partial specification for the subplan that achieves the parent step's effects given its preconditions.

Reference-contexts: Recent work has shown that plans play a much larger role in agent interaction [18]. In particular, the structure of discourse plans plays a role in the comprehension of the discourse <ref> [6, 11, 16] </ref> and contributes to the nature of subsequent communication [15, 24]. 2.1 Representing Intentional Structure As has been noted [15, 16, 24], a precise definition of intention in discourse plans is crucial for enabling systems to respond appropriately to failures of their communicative actions.

Reference-contexts: Second, discourse plans must represent the informational structure of utterances. Discourse interpretation requires that an agent be able to recognize the relationships between the information conveyed in consecutive elements of discourse (e.g., <ref> [7, 16] </ref>). Choosing syntactic structures and connective markers that convey these relationships requires that a discourse generator represent informational [19, 21, 22] as well as intentional [4] structure. <p> If this happens, the planner will unnecessarily report failure. Consider those discourses in which individual utterances play several roles. Maier [12] describes the need for a system to generate this type of discourse and Hobbs <ref> [7] </ref> provides an example of one such discourse. We provide another example here: Lucentio has asked for Bianca's hand. He always considered her Senior Baptista's fairest daughter. That is also why Lucentio always chose her to model for his paintings.

Reference-contexts: As Hovy et al. <ref> [8] </ref> point out, these problems stem from an approach to discourse planning that does not clearly distinguish between the representation of communicative action and the design of a planning algorithm that manipulates that representation. <p> Without a representation of the causal roles that these effects play, a system cannot determine whether an additional response is required. Informational Structure in Previous Systems Most previous planning systems do not provide an explicit representation for either intentional or informational structure. As noted in Hovy, et al <ref> [8] </ref>, to the extent that informational constraints were represented, each set of constraints was duplicated for many similar discourse 1 In this plan, the dashed arcs indicate the decomposition of PARENT-ACTION into the actions in its subplan.

While a parent step specifies the effects it has on the mental state of the hearer, it is the responsibility of the executable steps at the leaves of the subplan rooted at the parent step to ensure that those conditions are indeed established. <p> Previous POCL planners have been non-hierarchical; DPOCL provides an extension that introduces action decomposition into the POCL framework. For a complete definition of DPOCL see <ref> [25] </ref>. In the following discussion we will refer to the sample discourse from Section 3.1. Figure 2 shows an example of a DPOCL plan structure for this discourse. <p> Figure 4 summarizes the DPOCL planning algorithm. For a complete definition, see <ref> [25] </ref>. Causal refinement in DPOCL is essentially identical to causal refinement in previous POCL planners. An unsatisfied precondition of some step in the plan is selected and a causal link is added to establish the needed condition. <p> Specifically, DPOCL is both sound and, for certain classes of plans, complete. Proofs of soundness and completeness can be found in <ref> [25] </ref>. With respect to the class of plans that DPOCL can generate, DPOCL is primitive complete. That is, it can generate all possible sequences of executable actions, but not necessarily all hierarchical structures that could account for those executable actions. <p> In particular, DPOCL cannot generate plans where two abstract steps are ordered one before the other in order to avoid a harmful interaction but some interleaving of the steps in their subplans exists that avoids this interaction. For a more complete description of this restriction on DPOCL's completeness, see <ref> [25] </ref>. 7 Discussion As others have pointed out, the precise representation of intentional and informational structure is critical to the effective use of discourse plans.
