Abstract: In this paper we consider the sequential and parallel complexity of the maximum matching problem in chordal and strongly chordal graphs. We prove that, given a strongly perfect elimination ordering, a maximum matching in a strongly chordal graph can be found in a linear time. On the other hand we observe that the matching problem restricted to chordal (paths) graphs is of the same parallel complexiy as a general bipartite matching.

Reference-contexts: A path graph is the intersection graph of a collection of paths of a tree. We also can define chordal graphs by characteristic orderings. Theorem: <ref> [4] </ref> A graph G = (V; E) is chordal iff there is an ordering &lt; of V , such that with x &lt; y, x &lt; z, xy 2 E, and xz 2 E, we have yz 2 E. Such an ordering is called a perfect elimination ordering.

Reference-contexts: It remains an intersting problem to find an optimal parallel perfect elimination algorithm for strongly chordal graphs. Finally we would like to remark that strongly chordal graphs are exactly the chordal graphs that are complements of comparability graphs <ref> [6] </ref>. It is known that the perfect matching problem restricted to complements of cocomparability graphs is equivalent to 2-processor scheduling, and this can be done in log 2 n) time with a polynomial processor bound [7].

Reference-contexts: It is known that the perfect matching problem restricted to complements of cocomparability graphs is equivalent to 2-processor scheduling, and this can be done in log 2 n) time with a polynomial processor bound <ref> [7] </ref>. It might be interesting to find a reasonable upper class of strongly chordal graphs and complements of comparability graphs such that the perfect matching problem can still be parallelized. 6 6 Acknowledgements Recently Stephan Olariu has mentioned to us that R. Lin got similar results to ours.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Chordal graphs became interesting as a generalization of interval graphs (see for example <ref> [8] </ref>). We call a graph chordal if every cycle of length greater than three has a chord, i.e. an edge that joins two non consecutive vertices of the cycle. Note that interval graphs are not only chordal but strongly chordal as defined in [3].

Reference-contexts: This algorithm can be turned into a (non optimal) parallel algorithm. The random bits in the algorithm of <ref> [9] </ref> can be eliminated in the special case of strongly chordal graphs. On the other hand, we shall find out that matching restricted to chordal graphs (also restricted to path graphs) is of the same parallel complexity degree as bipartite matching. In section 2, we shall introduce the basic notation. <p> Proof: We prove that there is at most one defect free perfect matching. Since this is the perfect matching with the minimum sum of labels l uv = (u v) 2 , we get a perfect matching by the minimum perfect matching algorithm of <ref> [9] </ref> in O (log 2 n) time with a polynomial processor bound. Lemma 3: There exists at most one defect free perfect matching. Proof: Assume there are defect-free perfect matchings M and M 0 . Assume M and M 0 coincide in fuju &lt; xg but not in fuju xg.
