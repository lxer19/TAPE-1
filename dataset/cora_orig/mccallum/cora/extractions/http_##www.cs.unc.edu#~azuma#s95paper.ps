Abstract: The use of prediction to eliminate or reduce the effects of system delays in Head-Mounted Display systems has been the subject of several recent papers. A variety of methods have been proposed but almost all the analysis has been empirical, making comparisons of results difficult and providing little direction to the designer of new systems. In this paper, we characterize the performance of two classes of head-motion predictors by analyzing them in the frequency domain. The first predictor is a polynomial extrapolation and the other is based on the Kalman filter. Our analysis shows that even with perfect, noise-free inputs, the error in pre dicted position grows rapidly with increasing prediction intervals and input signal frequencies. Given the spectra of the original head motion, this analysis estimates the spectra of the predicted motion, quantifying a predictor's performance on different sys tems and applications. Acceleration sensors are shown to be more useful to a predictor than velocity sensors. The methods described will enable designers to determine maximum acceptable system delay based on maximum tolerable error and the character istics of user motions in the application.

Reference-contexts: A comparison of estimated and actual peak errors is provided. With this, a system designer can specify the maximum allowable timedomain error and then determine the system delays that will satisfy that requirement for a particular application. This paper is a short version of chapter 6 of <ref> [1] </ref>. That chapter is included with the CD-ROM version of this paper. 3 Approach The frequency-domain analysis draws upon linear systems theory, spectral analysis, and the Fourier and Z-transforms. This section provides a brief overview; for details please see [3] [9] [12] [14] [15] [16]. <p> Whenever a prediction is required, the polynomial extrapolation bases it on the x , v, and a from the current state X. 5.2 Kalman-based predictor transfer matrix The following discussion is terse due to space limitations; please read <ref> [1] </ref> for a more thorough explanation. The goal is to derive a 1 by 1 transfer matrix O (z) relating input position G (z) to predicted position H (z). <p> These "humps" in the predicted spectrum represent jitter. 6.3 Maximum time-domain error Deriving a theoretical expression for the maximum error in the time domain would be useful. Determining this requires estimat ing the spectrum of the error signal, which is briefly sketched here for the Kalman predictors; see <ref> [1] </ref> for details. Let e (t) be the error signal, which is the difference be tween the predicted position h (t) and the original position g (t): e (t ) = h (t ) - g (t + p) where p is the prediction interval.

Since prediction will not be perfect, evaluating how well predictors perform is important. Virtually all evaluation so far has been empirical, where the predictors were run in simulation or in real time to generate the error estimates. <p> This makes the analysis simpler. The assumptions of linearity and separability are generally reasonable for the translation terms, but not necessarily for the orientation terms. For example, quaternions are neither separable nor linear <ref> [2] </ref>. To use this analysis, we must locally linearize orientation around the current orientation before each prediction, assuming the changes across the prediction interval are small. <p> Numerical differentiation accentuates noise, so performing two differentiation steps is generally impractical. A few predictors use inertial sensors to aid prediction, such as <ref> [2] </ref> [5] [11]. These sensors are used in Case 2 and Case 3. Section 6 will compare these three cases against each other, using the transfer functions derived in this section.

Reference-contexts: Faster head motions have spectra with more energy at higher frequencies. Estimating the power spectrum of a timedomain signal is an inherently imperfect operation. Careful estimates require the use of frequency windows to reduce leakage <ref> [6] </ref>. Even with such steps, the errors can be significant. What this means is that the theoretical results in Section 6 that use estimated power spectra do not always perfectly match timedomain results from simulated or actual data.

Reference-contexts: By using the small angle assumption, rotations can be characterized by linear yaw, pitch, and roll operations where the order of the operations is unimportant. Another approach for linearizing orientation is described in <ref> [8] </ref>. Finally, the third assumption is that the input signal is measured at evenly-spaced discrete intervals.
