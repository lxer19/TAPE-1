Abstract: We study networks of relaxation oscillators coupled with time delay synapses. A pair of oscillators is analyzed and shown to attain loosely synchronous solutions for a wide range of initial conditions and time delays. Simulations of one and two dimensional oscillator networks indicate that locally coupled oscillators are also loosely synchronous. Desynchronous solutions are possible when system parameters are varied. To characterize loosely synchronous networks, we introduce a measure of synchrony, the maximum time difference between any two oscillators. In locally excitatory globally inhibitory oscillator networks with time delays, we find that desynchro-nous solutions for different groups of oscillators are maintained, and the number of groups that can be segregated is related to the maximum time difference within each group. To examine the maximum time difference, we display its histograms for oscillator networks in one and two dimensions. Also, a range of initial conditions is given so that the maximum time difference is contained as the system evolves. available at ftp.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/tech-report/1996/TR47-DIR The Ohio State University

Reference-contexts: Different objects are represented by different phases of oscillation. This particular form of temporal correlation is referred to as oscillatory correlation [36]. Using this concept, oscillator networks performing a variety of perceptual tasks, e.g., sensory segmentation and feature binding, have been proposed <ref> [14, 11, 40, 2] </ref>. Oscillatory associative memories have also been constructed, and have the benefit that multiple patterns can be recalled simultaneously [41, 35]. Time delays in signal transmission are inevitable in both the brain and physical systems. In unmyelinated axons, the speed of signal conduction is approximately 1mm/ms [13]. <p> To implement oscillatory correlation effectively, a robust and quick method of desynchroni-zation must also exist. Several authors have proposed models that perform both synchronization and desynchronization <ref> [38, 28, 2] </ref>. However, the process of separating groups of oscillators was shown in simulations, but not analyzed. Terman and Wang [36] proved that desynchronization is achieved in their locally excitatory globally inhibitory oscillator network (LEGION) [42].

Reference-contexts: These properties are thoroughly understood analytically. Due to these unique properties, we have chosen to examine the effects of time delays in relaxation oscillators. To our knowledge, time delays in networks of relaxation oscillators have not been extensively studied. In Grasman and Jansen <ref> [9] </ref>, a perturbation analysis was carried out for coupled relaxation oscillators with time delays. The coupling was assumed to be small and the interaction term was not based on excitatory chemical synapses, as is ours.

Reference-contexts: The inclusion of time delays in a differential equation can cause a stable point to destabilize, an unstable point to become stable <ref> [20, 12] </ref>, and in other cases, chaos can emerge in a system that would otherwise be described by a stable fixed point [31]. To illustrate the effects time delays may have, we discuss the following equation, The above equation has an asymptotically stable fixed point at zero.

Reference-contexts: If is less than the lower bound in (14), then our analysis shows that neutrally stable desynchronous solutions of period arise for some initial conditions in region IV of Fig. 4. This is analogous to a case of antiphase behavior as discussed by Kopell and Somers <ref> [15] </ref>. In [15] it was stated that stable antiphase solutions can arise given a coupling strength between relaxation oscillators that is not too large, with limit cycles such that the time spent on the active and silent phases are sufficiently disparate. <p> If is less than the lower bound in (14), then our analysis shows that neutrally stable desynchronous solutions of period arise for some initial conditions in region IV of Fig. 4. This is analogous to a case of antiphase behavior as discussed by Kopell and Somers <ref> [15] </ref>. In [15] it was stated that stable antiphase solutions can arise given a coupling strength between relaxation oscillators that is not too large, with limit cycles such that the time spent on the active and silent phases are sufficiently disparate. Our results for region IV are in agreement with these statements. <p> Because the speed of an oscillator is identical on both upper and lower branches, these desynchronous solutions are neutrally stable, that is, any small perturbation moves the oscillators into another nearby desynchronous solution. This possibility is also noted in <ref> [15] </ref>. The range of possible desynchro-nous solutions does not cover the entire area of region IV. We do not delve further into these particular desynchronous solutions. We have obtained some analytic results for a few small convex areas within region V of Fig. 4. <p> Below a certain connection strength, a pair of oscillators can exhibit neutrally stable desyn-chronous solutions, with the same period as the synchronous solution. This result is in agreement with the results of <ref> [15] </ref>. With this result we found an analogous behavior to that of fractured synchrony described in [34]. Above the critical time delay, a pair of oscillators typically displays antiphase behavior with a frequency that can be significantly higher than the frequency of the synchronous solution.

Reference-contexts: How long range synchronization is achieved in the presence of significant time delays is an important question. Furthermore, in any physical implementation (such as analog VLSI) of an oscillator network, transmission delays are unavoidable. Since even small delays may alter the dynamics of differential equations with time delays <ref> [16] </ref>, it is necessary to understand how conduction delays change the behavior of oscillator networks. <p> A trajectory for the above equation is the thick curve displayed in Fig. 1. If one introduces a time delay, then the trivial solution becomes unstable for any positive delay <ref> [16] </ref>. One such trajectory for this time delay differential equation is the thin curve in Fig. 1. In this paper we study relaxation oscillators with time delay coupling. Relaxation oscillators have properties of fast synchrony when compared to non-relaxation type, such as sinusoidal oscillators [33, 39, 36, 34].

Reference-contexts: How the brain links various features to form a coherent object is known as the feature binding problem. Theoreticians have proposed that temporal correlations in the firing patterns of different neurons may serve to link separate features <ref> [21, 37] </ref>. One may implement temporal correlation with neural oscillators. In vision, for example, each element, or pixel of an image, can be represented with an oscillator. A temporal labelling process is then implemented such that all oscillators comprising an object have the same phase.

Reference-contexts: These studies indicate that neural activity can be synchronized over long distances, e.g., 14 mm in monkey sensorimotor cortex, and across both hemispheres of the brain <ref> [32] </ref>. Visual features of an object, such as motion, color, and orientation, are processed in distinct cortical areas [46]. The brain is able to group, or link, these features together to create the perception of a coherent object. <p> This may explain why synchrony is not seen across distances of more than 7 mm in the cat visual cortex, where lateral connections within the cortex are assumed to give rise to the observed synchronization <ref> [32] </ref>. Also, measurements of synchrony in neural activities indicate that synchrony is not perfect [32]. This imperfect synchronization might indicate the existence of loose synchrony because lateral connections always have time delays. Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank C.

A one dimensional ring of relaxation oscillators in their system exhibited two distinct groups of oscillators. Each group achieved perfect synchrony and was approximately antiphase with the other group. In our simulation, two groups of oscillators exist in a one dimensional chain of oscillators. <p> Below a certain connection strength, a pair of oscillators can exhibit neutrally stable desyn-chronous solutions, with the same period as the synchronous solution. This result is in agreement with the results of [15]. With this result we found an analogous behavior to that of fractured synchrony described in <ref> [34] </ref>. Above the critical time delay, a pair of oscillators typically displays antiphase behavior with a frequency that can be significantly higher than the frequency of the synchronous solution. In networks of oscillators, with , antiphase, loosely synchronous, and other more complex behaviors are seen in numerical simulations.

A single oscillator is defined as (1a) These functions are similar to those used in <ref> [36] </ref>. The x-nullcline, , is a cubic function.

Dynamics Including Time Delay 3.1 Singular Solutions We now introduce a time delay in the interactions. <p> Our analysis in this section and Section 3.2 is derived at the singular limit, i.e. . We have not carried out a perturbation analysis. We note, however, that Terman and Wang <ref> [36] </ref> have carried out an analysis of networks of relaxation oscillators in the singular limit and extended their analysis from to small positive . <p> The Euclidean measure of distance does not yield intuitive results because of the constantly changing speed of motion along the limit cycle. We instead use the time difference between the two oscillators, <ref> [18, 36] </ref>. This function measures the time it takes an oscillator at to travel to and is only valid if both oscillators are on silent phase, or active phase of the limit cycle. <p> These oscillators jump up to the active phase and recruit their stimulated neighbors and so on. Since each jump decreases the distance between coupled oscillators, a group of stimulated neighboring oscillators quickly synchronizes. Following <ref> [36] </ref>, we refer to a group of stimulated and connected oscillators as a block. A block will jump up to the active phase, while other blocks continue to travel along the silent phase, approaching the attracting fixed points. This mechanism is called selective gating [36]. <p> Following <ref> [36] </ref>, we refer to a group of stimulated and connected oscillators as a block. A block will jump up to the active phase, while other blocks continue to travel along the silent phase, approaching the attracting fixed points. This mechanism is called selective gating [36]. When a block of oscillators jumps down, GI quickly releases its inhibition to the network on a fast time scale. The x-nullclines of all oscillators will then rise so that the attracting fixed points disappear. <p> Other blocks can then jump up to the active phase and the aforementioned process repeats. Assuming a block of oscillators is perfectly synchronous, the number of blocks that can be desynchronized is related to the ratio of the time an oscillator block spends on the active and silent phases <ref> [36] </ref>. If, however, a block of oscillators is not perfectly synchronous, the amount of time a block spends in the active phase increases. The amount of time a block spends in the active phase is thus an important measure for the network.

Reference-contexts: How the brain links various features to form a coherent object is known as the feature binding problem. Theoreticians have proposed that temporal correlations in the firing patterns of different neurons may serve to link separate features <ref> [21, 37] </ref>. One may implement temporal correlation with neural oscillators. In vision, for example, each element, or pixel of an image, can be represented with an oscillator. A temporal labelling process is then implemented such that all oscillators comprising an object have the same phase.
