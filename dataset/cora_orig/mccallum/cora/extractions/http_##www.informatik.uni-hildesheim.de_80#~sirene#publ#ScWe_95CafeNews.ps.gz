Abstract: CAFE ("Conditional Access for Europe") is a project sponsored by the European Union. It has designed the most advanced multiparty-secure secure payment system so far, which is now trialed at the EU premises in Brussels. It started in Dec. 1992 and ends in Nov. 1995. The consortium consists of groups for social and market studies: Cardware (GB), Institut fur Sozialforschung (D); software and hardware producers: Dig-iCash (NL), Gemplus (F), Ingenico (F), Siemens (D); and designers of secure cryptographic protocols: CWI (NL), PTT Research (NL), SEPT (F), Sintef De-lab Trondheim (N), Universities of Aarhus (DK), Hildesheim (D), and Leuven (B). An important aspect of CAFE is high security of all parties concerned, with the least possible requirements that they are forced to trust other parties (multi-party security), and less dependence on the tamper-resistance of devices than with other proposals for stored value cards. CAFE proposes an open architecture for small and high value payments, post-pay (like credit cards) or pre-pay (like stored value cards). For small everyday transactions all payments can be made o*ine, and privacy is an important issue. Other features are loss tolerance,
