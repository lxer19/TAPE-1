Reference-contexts: Thus, up to a scaling factor, p n (t) is a Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind for the interval <ref> [2; 2] </ref>. The computations of the BCR algorithm require the solution of systems (12) for polynomials of different degrees, with the highest degree being equal to 2 k1 . Let t (n) j denote the zeros of p n and let ff (n) partial fraction coefficients of 1=p n . <p> of the block tridiagonal matrix M introduced in Example 3.3 is of the form S 1 - (A)S j1 (A)S i (A) for j &lt; i, where denotes the number of diagonal blocks, and S k is a Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind of degree k for the interval <ref> [2; 2] </ref>, i.e., S k (t) := sin By symmetry, it suffices to consider the case j i. The parallel algorithm described in [19] uses the partial fraction representation of S 1 - (t)S j1 (t)S i (t). <p> We also observe that in Examples 3.3 and 3.4, the coefficients of partial fraction representations grow slowly, or not at all, as the degree of the denominator increases, when the poles are zeros of Chebyshev polynomials of the first or second kind in the interval <ref> [2; 2] </ref>. 7 The observation that the partial fraction coefficients of a rational function whose poles are distributed like zeros of a Chebyshev polynomial, are fairly small suggests the following approach to determining an incomplete partial fraction representation of an arbitrary reciprocal polynomial 1=p . <p> Moreover, the points t 1 ; t 2 ; : : : ; t k are uniformly distributed on the unit circle with respect to the density function (t) = 1 2 as k ! 1. 2 EXAMPLE 3.6. Let T be the interval <ref> [2; 2] </ref>. The Leja points for T are uniformly distributed on T with respect to the density function (t) := 2 This follows from results of Leja [31, Lemme 1] and Walsh [57]; see [38] for details. <p> This suggests, in view of Examples 3.3 and 3.4, that coefficients of the partial fraction representation of a reciprocal polynomial 1=p (t) = j=1 (t t j ) 1 , whose poles t j are Leja points for <ref> [2; 2] </ref>, are not very large. Theoretical and numerical results in support of this hypothesis are presented in Sections 4 and 5. 2 3.2. Algorithms for determining IPF (t ) representations. <p> We are presently studying a generalization of Leja points suggested by the minimization problem (44). Computed examples in Section 5 indicate that this generalization is appropriate for determining incomplete partial fraction representations with coefficients of small magnitude. We remark that other generalizations of Leja points are investigated in <ref> [2, 32] </ref>. <p> Type Description 1 t j random in [1; 1] 2 t j := j=n 3 s j random in <ref> [2; 0] </ref>; t j := j=n 4 s j random in [0; 1]; t j := j=n The presence of large coefficients in the IPF (t ) representation of r does not affect the accuracy of the result as much when jr (t)j is large as when jr (t)j is small.

Reference-contexts: Computed examples in [17] show that this, indeed, is the case. 2 EXAMPLE 3.4. This example comes from the solution of elliptic problems using the parallel solver described in [19]. Bank and Rose <ref> [3, Theorem 2.1] </ref> show that the (i; j)th block of the inverse of the block tridiagonal matrix M introduced in Example 3.3 is of the form S 1 - (A)S j1 (A)S i (A) for j &lt; i, where denotes the number of diagonal blocks, and S k is a Chebyshev

Reference-contexts: In view of this, we primarily consider [n=n] (diagonal) Pade approximants because they offer the highest order of approximation, but we note that for certain problems [(n1)=n] Pade approximants may offer certain advantages. We observe that the A-acceptability of diagonal Pade approximants was demonstrated by Birkhoff and Varga in <ref> [4] </ref>. A careful examination of formula (48) shows that when n is increased, the error at a fixed point t is reduced, and, moreover, the region around the origin in which r n;n gives an acceptable approximation of e t is enlarged.

Reference-contexts: Partial fraction representations of very high-order rational Chebyshev and Pade approximants of the matrix exponential are advocated in [20, 18, 21, 30]. Applications of the partial fraction representation in algorithms for problems in Control Theory are described in <ref> [5, 11, 35] </ref>. A parallel version of the rational Krylov algorithm for generalized eigenvalue problems described by Ruhe [41] also uses the partial fraction representation of rational functions. Other algorithms based on the partial fraction representation are considered in [60, 61, 63]. <p> We note that the Krylov subspaces determined by the matrices A t jl I are independent of the constants t jl . This observation has spurred the development of several iterative methods for the solution of the linear systems of equations in Step 2.1 of Algorithm 2; see <ref> [5, 11, 14] </ref>. 3.1. Examples. We now present several examples that illustrate that the evaluation of appropriately chosen IPF representations of rational functions q=p can give much higher accuracy than the evaluation of partial fraction representations.

Reference-contexts: Ten years later Sweet [50, 51] proposed the use of the partial fraction representation of reciprocal polynomials in the implementation of the Block Cyclic Reduction (BCR) method on parallel computers. On sequential computers the BCR method is implemented by using the factored form of reciprocal polynomials (e.g., see <ref> [6, 36, 47] </ref>), but this representation can be difficult to implement efficiently on multiprocessors. The use of partial fractions makes the BCR method competitive with parallel elliptic solvers based on matrix decomposition. <p> Assume that M has 2 k 1 diagonal blocks A, for some integer k 1. Then the linear system (11) can be solved rapidly by the BCR algorithm, as described in <ref> [6, 36] </ref>. This algorithm requires the solution of linear systems of equations of the form p n (A)x = b;(12) where p n (t) := 2C n (t=2) and C n (t) := cos (n arccos (t)).

Reference-contexts: An analysis of the behavior of roundoff errors when using Algorithm 1.1 in the BCR method can be found in [36]. Algorithms for computing incomplete partial fraction representations have previously been considered by Henrici <ref> [23] </ref>. These algorithms are designed to compute the coefficients of an IPF representation efficiently once the partial factors have been decided upon, rather than determining partial factors that yield IPF representations with small coefficients. 3.

Reference-contexts: Among these rational approximants, those with a single real pole of high multiplicity are popular because they require only the factorization of one real linear system of equations in each time step, and because they approximate e t better than rational approximants with multiple real poles; see <ref> [24, 34] </ref> for a discussion. Therefore, integration methods based on rational approximants with only one pole are attractive to implement on sequential computers. However, they are difficult to implement efficiently on parallel computers.

Reference-contexts: The presence of two levels of parallelism is of particular importance when the computer architecture offers some form of hierarchical parallelism. Examples of such architectures include clusters of multiprocessor workstations, massively parallel machines with vector processing units and actual machine prototypes <ref> [27] </ref>. By mapping each large grain task on a cluster of several tightly coupled processors, communication requests within each task can be serviced efficiently, while there is less demand for costly communication between processor clusters.

Reference-contexts: Among these rational approximants, those with a single real pole of high multiplicity are popular because they require only the factorization of one real linear system of equations in each time step, and because they approximate e t better than rational approximants with multiple real poles; see <ref> [24, 34] </ref> for a discussion. Therefore, integration methods based on rational approximants with only one pole are attractive to implement on sequential computers. However, they are difficult to implement efficiently on parallel computers.

Reference-contexts: Ten years later Sweet [50, 51] proposed the use of the partial fraction representation of reciprocal polynomials in the implementation of the Block Cyclic Reduction (BCR) method on parallel computers. On sequential computers the BCR method is implemented by using the factored form of reciprocal polynomials (e.g., see <ref> [6, 36, 47] </ref>), but this representation can be difficult to implement efficiently on multiprocessors. The use of partial fractions makes the BCR method competitive with parallel elliptic solvers based on matrix decomposition. <p> An analysis of the behavior of roundoff errors when using Algorithm 1.1 in the BCR method can be found in <ref> [36] </ref>. Algorithms for computing incomplete partial fraction representations have previously been considered by Henrici [23]. These algorithms are designed to compute the coefficients of an IPF representation efficiently once the partial factors have been decided upon, rather than determining partial factors that yield IPF representations with small coefficients. 3. <p> Assume that M has 2 k 1 diagonal blocks A, for some integer k 1. Then the linear system (11) can be solved rapidly by the BCR algorithm, as described in <ref> [6, 36] </ref>.

An important observation is that in Algorithm 1.1, n linear systems of equations have to be solved sequentially. Hence, when mapping Algorithm 1.1 on a parallel architecture, one can only exploit the parallelism available in the solution of each individual linear system.
