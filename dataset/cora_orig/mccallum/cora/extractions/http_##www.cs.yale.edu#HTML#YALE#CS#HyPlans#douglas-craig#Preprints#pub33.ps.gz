Abstract: Multigrid methods are analyzed in the style of standard iterative methods. A basic error bound is derived in terms of residuals on neighboring levels. The terms in this bound derive from the iterative methods used as smoothers on each level and the operators used to go from a level to the next coarser level. This bound is correct whether the underlying operator is symmetric or nonsymmetric, definite or indefinite, and singular or nonsingular. We allow any iterative method as a smoother (or rougher) in the multigrid cycle. While standard multigrid error analysis typically assumes a specific multigrid cycle (e.g., a V, W, or F cycle), analysis for arbitrary multigrid cycles, including adaptively chosen ones, is provided. This theory applies directly to aggregation-disaggregation methods used to solve systems of linear equations. 1. Introduction. In this paper, linear problems

Reference-contexts: Symmetric multigrid schemes assume that M k = N k (see [3], [5]-[8], [11], [12], [34], [39], and [49]) and nonsymmetric multigrid schemes usually assume that N k = I, where I is the identity (see <ref> [1] </ref>, [2], [4], [6], [9], [25]-[32], [38], [41], [42], [47], [48], [50]).

This is worst case analysis and rarely models the behavior seen in practice.

Reference-contexts: In the multigrid literature, the term smoother has become synonymous with the iterative methods M k and N k . However, it is a term which has been abused frequently by many authors, including one of us. The term was used in <ref> [9] </ref> to describe the effect of one iteration of an iterative method on each of the components of the error vector. For many relaxation methods (e.g., SSUR and Gauss-Seidel), the norm of each error component is reduced each iteration; hence, the term smoother. <p> Symmetric multigrid schemes assume that M k = N k (see [3], [5]-[8], [11], [12], [34], [39], and [49]) and nonsymmetric multigrid schemes usually assume that N k = I, where I is the identity (see [1], [2], [4], [6], <ref> [9] </ref>, [25]-[32], [38], [41], [42], [47], [48], [50]). However, it is computationally more efficient to assume M k = I (see [15]) since the residual on level k 1 is f k1 and does not need to be recomputed.

Reference-contexts: This method can use substantially less memory than a standard iterative or multigrid algorithm. An additional note about domain reduction is that it leads naturally to more than 2 d subspaces for a d dimensional problem. In <ref> [13] </ref>, an eight way decomposition of a problem on a square is constructed, leading to problems defined on squares, rectangles, and triangles.

Only two levels (with many coarse space correction problems), no smoothing on the fine grid, and k = 1 makes computational sense for this method.

Reference-contexts: This leads to very efficient direct methods instead of the expected iterative ones. A side benefit of this theory is that the fine grid problem does not have to be generated (see [21], <ref> [20] </ref>, and [23]) and, by using a trick, most of the coarse space matrices do not have to be generated either (see [18]).

Reference-contexts: After all, this case is merely a block iterative method used for smoothing. We define a parallel multigrid algorithm in x5 for the case where multiple coarse spaces are employed. A number of different parallel multigrid methods are covered by this formulation (see [22], [27], and <ref> [45] </ref>). The simple analysis of x3.1 is extended to this case and this analysis is shown to be sharp for an example method. The theory in x3 depends on three sets of parameters which are available either dynamically or in advance. <p> x k = f k exactly or by smoothing (2) If C k 6= ;, then repeat i = 1; ; k : (2a) Smoothing: x k M (i) (2b) Residual Correction: x k x k + `2C k (2c) Smoothing: x k N (i) (3) Return x k Ta'asan <ref> [45] </ref> introduced this method to the multigrid community when standard multigrid failed to converge for a class of problems with highly oscillatory solutions. He uses standard interpolation and projection methods and a Kaczmarz relaxation method in his examples.

Reference-contexts: Multigrid methods combine scaled iterative methods (called smoothers) with iterative residual correction on coarser grids to reduce the error on a given (fine) grid. There are similar procedures, known as aggregation-disaggregation methods (see [14], [22], [24], [33], [40] and <ref> [46] </ref>), when A is not derived from partial differential equations; our theory applies directly to these methods. Many multigrid papers begin by narrowing their scope just to problems which are symmetric and positive definite, symmetric and indefinite, or nonsymmetric and indefinite.

Reference-contexts: Symmetric multigrid schemes assume that M k = N k (see [3], [5]-[8], [11], [12], [34], [39], and [49]) and nonsymmetric multigrid schemes usually assume that N k = I, where I is the identity (see [1], [2], [4], [6], [9], [25]-[32], [38], [41], [42], <ref> [47] </ref>, [48], [50]). However, it is computationally more efficient to assume M k = I (see [15]) since the residual on level k 1 is f k1 and does not need to be recomputed. Only rarely is the complete algorithm analyzed (see [15]-[17], [35]-[37], and [43]).
