Abstract: This paper describes the integration of the Berkeley Architectural Walkthrough Program with the National Institute of Standards and Technology's CFAST fire simulator. The integrated system creates a simulation based design environment for building fire safety systems; it also allows fire safety engineers to evaluate the performance of building designs, and helps make performance-based fire codes possible. We demonstrate that the visibility preprocessing and spatial decomposition used in the Walkthru also allow optimization of the data transfer between the simulator and visualizer. This optimization improves the ability to use available communication bandwidth to get needed simulation data to the Walkthru in the best order to visualize results in real time; an appropriate communication model and data structures are presented. General issues arising in the integration of environmental simulations and virtual worlds are discussed, as well as the specifics of the Walkthru-CFAST system, including relevant aspects of the user interface and of the visualization and simulation programming interfaces. A recommendation is made to structure future simulators in such a way that they can selectively direct their computational efforts toward specified spacetime regions of interest and thereby support real-time, interactive virtual environment visualization more effectively.

Reference-contexts: We are also considering parallelizing the CFAST core for the Berkeley Network of Workstations (NOW) <ref> [1] </ref>. For the case where communication bandwidth is the bottleneck, the framework provides mechanisms that are easy to use and that optimally exploit the available bandwidth, while hiding communications concerns from the simulation designer.

Reference-contexts: Combining such simulations with immersive visualization by one or more active observers adds particular challenges with respect to synchronization and data management. For systems that do offer interactive, real-time scientific visualization of complex simulations, the data transmission problem is well documented <ref> [3, 8, 10] </ref>. As the simulated system grows more complex, the amount of data needed to describe the full simulation state of the system in each time step can easily exceed the available bandwidth between simulator and visualizer.

Reference-contexts: This issue is also being studied by other groups at Berkeley <ref> [5] </ref>. In section 2, we discuss the simulation/visualization data management problem in the context of other related work in virtual environment simulation. <p> In the near future, we expect simulator technology to improve; simulators will become faster, and their designs will evolve to provide better support for interactive visualization. Recent work has shown that this can be a promising approach for modeling the dynamics of physical structures <ref> [5] </ref>. In the specific case of CFAST, NIST is working on a version that will be able to concentrate its computational efforts on critical areas of the simulation, improving the speed and potential size of the simulation.

Reference-contexts: The most common applications of these systems are either peer-to-peer simulation of the user's interaction with other users or simulated entities, or systems that use physics to make the world seem more real to an immersed user. Some more famous examples of the former include the Iowa driving simulator <ref> [7] </ref>, where the user's vehicle interacts with other independently-simulated road vehicles, and the department of defense's NPSNET [13, 19], where units of military vehicles engage in simulated combat on static terrain.

Another approach is to run the visualizer on the same (super)computer that performs the simulation, thereby hopefully gaining access to any needed data for visualization on demand in less than a frame time.

The video link approach also requires an extremely low-latency command line from the observer to the simulator to make the user's normal movements and interactions with the environment reasonably responsive.

The most basic is the naive, oldest-data-first strategy (figure 4A) which simply queues timeslice data into the communication channel as it becomes available.
