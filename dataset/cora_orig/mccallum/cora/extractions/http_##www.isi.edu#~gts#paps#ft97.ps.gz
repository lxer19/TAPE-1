Abstract: The recent surge in popularity of e-commerce prompted a lot of activity in the area of electronic payments. Solutions have been developed for cash, credit card and check-based electronic transactions. Much less attention has been paid to non-monetary commerce such as barter. In this paper we discuss the notion of "secure group barter" or multi-party fair exchange. We develop a classification of types of barter schemes and present new cryptographic protocols for multi-party exchange with fairness. These protocols assume the presence of a "semi-trusted neutral party".

Reference-contexts: Within the category of neutral party protocols, it useful to make the further distinction of "on-line" versus "offline" participation by the neutral party. Some protocols, such as <ref> [2, 1] </ref>, require the neutral party to participate actively only when there has been misbehavior by one of the two main parties ("off-line"). These off-line protocols are also called "optimistic", because they are most efficient in the (hoped-for) case when the main parties are honest. <p> In fact, the on-line protocols with certified delivery require the least computation and communication, and the perfect protocols require the most. On-line protocols with expected delivery require a few more public key operations (e.g., modular multiplications) than for certified delivery. Optimistic protocols such as <ref> [1] </ref> require two to three orders of magnitude more public key operations than for on-line protocols.

Reference-contexts: PCs were first brought up by Beaver in <ref> [4] </ref>. The 2-party STNP paper also mentions their relevance to STNP-based fair exchange. The following PC scenarios are given: 1. P 1 could misbehave in a way that causes Z to learn K 1 . 2.

Reference-contexts: If each trade in the subset has all zeros except for one +1 entry and one -1 entry, then the potential exchange will decompose as a collection of single-unit cyclic exchanges. In principle, finding such subsets can be done using techniques from secure multiparty computation <ref> [12, 5, 8] </ref>. Since the bulk of the computations are simple sums and comparisons, it is possible that efficient protocols could be found for this problem using existing techniques. This is an interesting area for further investigation. 6 Conclusions In conclusion, we have presented a classification of barter scenarios.

Reference-contexts: These off-line protocols are also called "optimistic", because they are most efficient in the (hoped-for) case when the main parties are honest. Other protocols, such as <ref> [15, 7, 11] </ref>, require the neutral party to participate in every exchange ("on-line"). The class of on-line fair exchange protocols can be further subdivided into those offering "certified delivery" versus "expected delivery". <p> A protocol achieves certified delivery [15] if each main party gets either the document it expects or proof that the other main party misbehaved. A protocol achieves expected delivery if each main party gets the document it expects. The protocols in <ref> [11] </ref> achieve expected delivery under the assumption that the neutral party does not collude with either of the main parties; they call this a "semi-trusted neutral party". <p> This, coupled with the consideration that different parties can be subject to very different administrative, legal and political controls, makes this kind of an environment unsuitable for optimistic fair exchange. All this leads us to extend the "semi-trusted neutral party" setting from 2-party fair exchange <ref> [11] </ref> to multi-party fair exchange. A semi-trusted neutral party can be selected on a case-by-case basis and asked to aid in the execution of a fair multi-party exchange. <p> Section 6 gives some conclusions and open problems. 2 2 Two-Party Fair Exchange with a Semi-Trusted Neutral Party In this section, we review the semi-trusted neutral party setting and the 2-party fair exchange protocol of <ref> [11] </ref>.

FE Fair Exchange TNP Trusted Neutral Party STNP Semi-Trusted Neutral Party OWF One-Way Function P i Protocol participant (indexed) K i Secret quantity held by P i The 2-party FE protocol with STNP works through 2-out-of-2 verifiable secret sharing [9, 10]. <p> These properties collectively translate into 1-resilience, i.e., as long at most one of protocol parties is dishonest, it can gain no advantage over the rest. For the moment, we consider this to be sufficient. Similar to the 2-party case described in <ref> [11] </ref>, we require that all protocol messages be private and authentic. Also, as in [11], we select an OWF f : G ! G where G is group in which membership testing, group operation and inverse computation are efficient. <p> For the moment, we consider this to be sufficient.
