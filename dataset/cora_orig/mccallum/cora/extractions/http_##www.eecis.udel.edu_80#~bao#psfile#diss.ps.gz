Reference-contexts: A particular application may choose one or many of the above schemes to deal with packet loss. There is also ongoing research to make some of these schemes more adaptive and conscious of the network environment and to improve their resilience to network packet loss <ref> [ACE, Sis97] </ref>. Because of the diversity of these schemes as well as the differences in the subjective quality requirement of each application, it is likely that the multimedia applications will present different packet loss requirements to the network. <p> In such a case, the original single data stream may be separated into I, P, and B streams and different network QoS may be assigned to each of the three streams <ref> [ACE] </ref>. In this case, the application layer QoS needs to be mapped onto multiple network layer QoS for multiple network streams. Error recovery scheme Error recovery schemes are used to deal with the information loss caused by network packet loss or excessive delay.

Reference-contexts: Even with the foundation of guaranteed QoS, this method can only provide statistical or predicted QoS. The overhead of this method includes the on-line modeling of the traffic and the communication required for renegotiation. Other work using dynamic resource allocation based on traffic change can be found in <ref> [GVSS96, Ada96, LX95] </ref>. In [GVSS96], the sender and the receiver of a video transmission session keep counters of transmitted/received packets and communicate with each other periodically for estimating the bandwidth needed. <p> These estimates are used to change the bandwidth reservation by a ramping factor. [GVSS96] shows that the choice of ramping factor should be a reflection of the 28 specific traffic pattern. The method proposed in <ref> [Ada96] </ref> predicts the bandwidth requirements for future frames using either adaptive or non-adaptive Least Mean Square (LMS) error linear predictors. The author has also presented several reservation schemes and pro-active congestion approaches. In [LX95], the real-time traffic is modeled as a sequence of frames.

Reference-contexts: RSVP is also used by routers to deliver QoS requests to all nodes along the path (s) of the flows and to establish and maintain state to provide the requested service <ref> [BCS94] </ref>. There is a common misperception about using RSVP to achieve the end-to-end QoS. We have to point out that RSVP is merely a signaling protocol that supports communications for QoS purposes.

Reference-contexts: Research has been done to solve this problem by designing 26 real-time dynamic resource allocation algorithms in order to satisfy the QoS in a resource-efficient way. 2.1.4.1 Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on QoS Feedback Bolla, et al. present a dynamic resource allocation scheme for ATM networks based on QoS feedback <ref> [BDDM93, BDL + 92] </ref>.

Bandwidth allocation is adaptively changed by an allocation controller by minimizing a cost function, which takes the overall cell loss and the number of refused connections into consideration.

Reference-contexts: There are controversies in recent studies about how important jitter control is for applications, considering the cost of having "traffic smoothers" at network switches <ref> [BDL + 92] </ref>. 9 We do not focus our study on jitter QoS for the following two reasons. First, jitter is a direct result of network delay. Since we try to provide guaranteed delay QoS for real-time applications, the jitter problem will be eased as a result. <p> Research has been done to solve this problem by designing 26 real-time dynamic resource allocation algorithms in order to satisfy the QoS in a resource-efficient way. 2.1.4.1 Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on QoS Feedback Bolla, et al. present a dynamic resource allocation scheme for ATM networks based on QoS feedback <ref> [BDDM93, BDL + 92] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: First, most current real-time multimedia users have a high tolerance for network packet loss because the current network technology does not provide packet loss QoS control on a per-application basis. For example, current video conferencing in MBONE (Multicasting Backbone) sometimes may suffer from over 50% packet loss <ref> [BDS96] </ref>. Even though predicted packet loss QoS control does 8 not provide deterministic QoS promises, it will still support much better QoS real-ization than what these applications are receiving right now.

Reference-contexts: Under OCP A, despite the differences in the QoS requirements, in the beginning of the transmission each source is simply allocated approximately the resources comparable to their average rates. Under the static scheme, we use Bruneel's approximation <ref> [BK93] </ref> to calculate the desired amount of resources needed 70 for the specific QoS requirement and then distribute the amount of resources among all the flows according to the weights of the calculated desired amounts. Figure 2.21 plots the final achieved loss ratio for each flow.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, packet loss at the beginning of the transmission may cause large variations in the observed loss ratio performance. Because we use the observed loss ratio performance as a guide to adjust the resource distribution, these large variations may result in unnecessary oscillatory behavior <ref> [BS96] </ref>. In order to ease this problem, we adopt a smooth start strategy by assuming that the flow starts in an initial state where a certain number of packets have already been transmitted.

Reference-contexts: The third gain from dynamic resource adjustment is that, due 29 to its self-adjustability, it provides flexibility in handling different types of sources without any a priori knowledge of the traffic generated by the sources <ref> [BS97] </ref>. Our presentation of the OCP A scheme in the following sections is supported by extensive simulation studies that explore different network conditions, different sources, and different combinations of requested QoS. Table 2.1 lists the simulation configurations that will be used in the discussion.

Reference-contexts: The first cost involves calculating, storing, and comparing VirtualClock timestamps. If each packet is of the same size, this cost 49 can be reduced to maintaining one VC timestamp for each flow. These operations can be implemented in hardware in high-speed environments <ref> [RGB96, BSZ97] </ref>. In this section, we focus on analyzing the second cost which results from the dynamic adjustment of resource shares. We associate the cost of dynamic adjustment of resource shares with two major operations: decreasing resources (CSE DW) operation and increasing resources (CSE UP) operation.

Reference-contexts: Second, the end-to-end QoS distribution should be done in a way that attempts to balance the network loads on different switches, therefore maximizing the resource utilization. Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) <ref> [BZB96] </ref> is a protocol that may be used for end-to-end QoS distribution in the Internet. RSVP is used by a host to request specific qualities of service from the network for particular application flows. <p> Under the proportional distribution, the higher the utilization, the looser the distributed local QoS: D (k) = D fl P m ; L (k) = L fl P m (3.5) 3.2 Signaling Protocol for QoS Distribution We use a signaling protocol which is similar to RSVP <ref> [BZB96] </ref> with One Pass With Advertising (OPWA) enhancement [SB95] for QoS distribution. RSVP (Resource ReSerVation Protocol) is a signaling protocol designed to achieve resource reservation for QoS purposes. <p> The Path message stores path state in each node along the way. This path state includes at least the IP address of the previous node on the path, which is used to route the Resv messages hop-by-hop in the reverse direction <ref> [BZB96] </ref>. 2. After receiving the Path message, the receiver starts sending a Resv message along the reverse of the transmission path, specifying the desired flow descriptors and resource reservation information. The Resv message usually results 77 in resource reservation actions on the nodes along the way. 3.

Reference-contexts: This is desirable for real-time applications which are delay-sensitive in which packets may expire if not transmitted within their deadlines. 2.1.2.1 Minimum Laxity Threshold (MLT) Given the deadline for the transmission of each packet at a switch, a way to satisfy these deadlines by scheduling is presented in <ref> [CKT89] </ref> as the Minimum Laxity Threshold (MLT). In MLT, all packets are served in increasing order of their laxities|the amount of time the server can remain idle or serve packets from other flows and still be able to serve this packet by its deadline. <p> MLT is proved to yield the best utilization among all scheduling schemes when the objective is to satisfy packet deadlines <ref> [CKT89] </ref>. First-In-First-Out (FIFO) is a special case of MLT when all the packets are considered to have the same deadline. MLT supports efficient resource utilization and is extremely simple to implement.

Reference-contexts: Similar conclusions have also been reached by other measurement-based admission control schemes <ref> [CKT96, JS97] </ref>. How to choose the performance parameters is an interesting issue that we will investigate in the next section. 4.5 Adaptive Parameter Tuning for Admission Control In our study in Section 4.4, we notice that the choice of admission control parameters directly affects the performance of the admission control.

Reference-contexts: Except for this change, service is provided the same way as in the conventional HoL priority without preemption. It is proved that the tail probabilities in this scheme are the same for all the queues [PTW88]. Chen and Stavrakakis generalize the HoL-PJ to provide more diversified QoS in <ref> [CS96] </ref>. The analysis is done on two queues containing two classes of packets with different QoS requirements. It is shown that, by tuning the waiting time T j , one can get desired loss ratios for each class as requested. <p> Therefore, this method can be used to satisfy any QoS requirements of delay bound as well as statistical loss ratio. However, the calculation to find the appropriate waiting time is done by linear programming, 21 which is extremely computationally intensive <ref> [CS96] </ref>. Specifically, the complexity of computation grows exponentially with the number of priority classes. Therefore it is difficult to implement this method in real time to provide QoS control. 2.1.2 Latency-based Schemes Latency-based schemes focus on serving packets based on their experienced delay or requested deadlines.

Reference-contexts: The vast majority of real-time multimedia applications|such as vic [MJ95], vat [JM], nv [Fre94]|are quite different from standard data applications, and require service that cannot be delivered within the typical data service architecture <ref> [CSZ92] </ref>. The difficulty arises from the following three major characteristics associated with these multimedia applications. First is the higher QoS sensitivity compared with other applications. <p> Some variations of MLT are Shortest-Time-to-Extinction (STE) and Early-Due-Date (EDD) [PTW88]. STE discards packets which have violated their deadlines. It is shown that the STE policy minimizes the total number of packets which miss their deadlines [PTW88]. 2.1.2.2 First-In-First-Out+ (FIFO+) In <ref> [CSZ92] </ref>, a revised version of FIFO called FIFO+ is introduced. FIFO+ enables full multiplexing in FIFO fashion. The only difference is that in FIFO+, 22 packets are transmitted not in the order of their actual arriving times, but their expected arriving times. <p> The sole objective of FIFO+ is to make the end-to-end delay of each packet to be as close as possible to the average end-to-end delay. Similar to FIFO, FIFO+ cannot support guaranteed delay. But <ref> [CSZ92] </ref> has shown that FIFO+ provides predicted delay in a resource-efficient way. Predicted delay QoS is attractive to real-time applications with adaptive playback time. In [CSZ92], applications with similar delay bound requirements are aggregated into one class/queue. Different priorities are assigned to classes with widely spaced delay bounds. <p> Similar to FIFO, FIFO+ cannot support guaranteed delay.

In each class, FIFO+ is used to schedule the packets in the class. [CSZ92] has shown that if appropriate source control and admission control are applied, FIFO+ can provide predicted delay QoS with high bandwidth utilization. 2.1.2.3 MLT with Priority Lazar and Pacifici introduce a method in [LP93] which combines the ideas of MLT and priority. <p> GPS usually does not require bandwidth allocation by peak rates and the guaranteed worst-case delay is valid even without shaping the traffic inside the network. But the worst-case delay bound is still very long compared to practical situations <ref> [Pat93, CSZ92] </ref>. The ideal GPS scheme cannot be implemented since it requires to be operated on an infinitely small time scale. Some packetized GPS algorithms are Weighted 25 Fair Queueing (WFQ) [DKS89], VirtualClock [Zha90], Self-Clocked Fair Queue--ing (SCFQ) [Gol94], and Start-Time Fair Queueing [GVC96]. <p> For real-time multimedia applications, the parameter-based approach can be problematic. First, multimedia traffic has diversified traffic characteristics; furthermore, these characteristics may be unknown in advance and unpredictable in the future over the lifetime of the application. This makes traffic modeling extremely difficult. Since integrated services networks <ref> [CSZ92] </ref> encourage a diversity of applications, it is believed that tightly modeling the traffic is neither necessary nor feasible [Flo96]. Second, the admission of a new flow under the parameter-based approach usually implies a guaranteed resource reservation to support the requested QoS of the new flow. <p> It is believed that most of the real-time applications have sufficient adaptiveness to survive occasional service deterioration, especially if the service deterioration is controlled to happen infrequently <ref> [CSZ92, ZK95, JDSZ97, Flo96] </ref>. Many multimedia 89 applications should thus benefit from measurement-based admission control because of the high utilization it provides. <p> There are two purposes for doing this. First, we use it as an example to describe the basic concepts and issues involved in measurement-based admission control. Second, the work in [JDSZ97] inspired our study presented in the sections that follow. In [JDSZ97], an admission control scheme for Integrated Services <ref> [CSZ92] </ref> is studied. Integrated Services Network Protocol (ISNP) is introduced in [CSZ92] as a concept to accommodate future applications with different levels of QoS. ISNP supports three types of QoS: guaranteed QoS, predicted QoS, and best-effort service. <p> Second, the work in [JDSZ97] inspired our study presented in the sections that follow.

Reference-contexts: Conventional admission control schemes use the worst-case network condition to make admission control decisions. If applied on multimedia applications, these schemes result in low resource 15 utilization. Therefore, research has been conducted to study measurement-based ad-mission control <ref> [JDSZ97, JSD97, TG97, Flo96, DKPS95] </ref>|making admission control decisions based on the measured network traffic and performance|to achieve higher admission ratio and higher resource utilization. However, there is no existing measurement-based scheme that considers the diversified packet loss tolerances of the applications. <p> It relies on the measurement of actual traffic load in making admission control decisions [JSD97]. The measurement-based approach has gained considerable attention in the Internet research community in handling real-time multimedia applications. 88 Some work under this approach can be found in <ref> [JDSZ97, JSD97, TG97, Flo96, DKPS95] </ref>. In [Flo96], an equivalent bandwidth of a set of flows is used in making admission control decisions. The equivalent bandwidth is defined as the bandwidth such that the actual bandwidth requirement exceeds this value with probability at most * [Flo96]. <p> The method presented in [JDSZ97] inspired our work in designing an appropriate admission control scheme for applications with diversified QoS requirements. We will describe their work in detail Section 4.2. Degermark, et al. extended the scheme in [JDSZ97] to support advanced reservations <ref> [DKPS95] </ref>. We have to point out that the above measurement-based admission control schemes have different purposes in QoS control and support different levels of QoS. But because of the usage of measured values, none of them can be used to provide guaranteed QoS.

Reference-contexts: The method requires deploying traffic monitors and a capacity allocation controller which computes the reallocation of resources in real-time. Fulp, et al. introduce an adaptive bandwidth allocation technique in <ref> [FR97] </ref>. In this method, the loss ratio performance of a source is monitored in real time and an on-line bandwidth renegotiation process adjusts the allocated bandwidth based on the comparison of the actual and the requested loss ratio performance. <p> The amount by which bandwidth is adjusted is based on heuristics and is not studied under multiple flow bandwidth sharing case <ref> [FR97] </ref>. 2.1.4.2 Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Traffic Change Some QoS control methods are designed to work with certain specific types of traffic, such as real-time video traffic. When variable bit rate coding schemes are used on real-time video [Oht94], a large burstiness is introduced into the traffic.

Reference-contexts: As a matter of fact, the relationship in Equation (3.2) ensures that once the local packet loss QoS L (k) is achieved at each switch R k (1 k m), the end-to-end packet loss performance is strictly better than the requested end-to-end packet loss tolerance L <ref> [FT96] </ref>. <p> Here we investigate two simple QoS distribution policies: even distribution and proportional distribution <ref> [FT96] </ref>. Even distribution Under this policy, each switch on the path is assigned exactly the same local QoS distribution.

Reference-contexts: For example, reserving resources based on the peak rate of the 5 source <ref> [FV90] </ref> can provide guaranteed QoS. Guaranteed QoS generally results in low resource utilization because of the isolation of resources. Statistical QoS is generally achieved by studying the statistical behavior of the traffic by means of formal analysis.

Reference-contexts: Conventional admission control schemes use the worst-case network condition to make admission control decisions. If applied on multimedia applications, these schemes result in low resource 15 utilization. Therefore, research has been conducted to study measurement-based ad-mission control <ref> [JDSZ97, JSD97, TG97, Flo96, DKPS95] </ref>|making admission control decisions based on the measured network traffic and performance|to achieve higher admission ratio and higher resource utilization. However, there is no existing measurement-based scheme that considers the diversified packet loss tolerances of the applications. <p> In the second part of Section 4.1, we summarize the focus and contributions of our research in providing a measurement-based admission controller that provides an adaptive and efficient solution for these applications. 84 Section 4.2 introduces the measurement-based admission control presented in <ref> [JDSZ97] </ref>, which provides a foundation of the measurement scheme used in our proposed admission controller. We will discuss three aspects of their work: the admission decision, the measurement process, and the insights from their simulation study. Section 4.3 presents the newly proposed admission control scheme. <p> When the source is "ill-behaved," a tight modeling is difficult to achieve. In order to improve the utilization, various admission control schemes [ZK94, LP91, GAN91] have been proposed to support statistical QoS. These schemes attempt to achieve higher resource utilization by weakening the degree of QoS reliability <ref> [JDSZ97] </ref>. The admission control in [ZK94] does not provide a worst-case scenario, instead it guarantees a bound on the probability of QoS violation based on the a priori statistical characterization of traffic. <p> It relies on the measurement of actual traffic load in making admission control decisions [JSD97]. The measurement-based approach has gained considerable attention in the Internet research community in handling real-time multimedia applications. 88 Some work under this approach can be found in <ref> [JDSZ97, JSD97, TG97, Flo96, DKPS95] </ref>. In [Flo96], an equivalent bandwidth of a set of flows is used in making admission control decisions. The equivalent bandwidth is defined as the bandwidth such that the actual bandwidth requirement exceeds this value with probability at most * [Flo96]. <p> In the equivalent bandwidth calculation, the measured average rates of the flows are used. In [TG97], the admission control decision is made based on the network measurements alone by monitoring the behavior of the current existing flows, without assuming a statistical or worst-case model for the traffic. In <ref> [JDSZ97] </ref>, the sources are modeled with token buckets. When making an admission control decision, the worst-case parameters of the traffic of the new incoming flow are used; in the meantime, the traffic of the existing flows inside the network is represented by the measured value. <p> The network delay performance is also measured and used in predicting the delay performance as a result of admitting the incoming flow. The method presented in <ref> [JDSZ97] </ref> inspired our work in designing an appropriate admission control scheme for applications with diversified QoS requirements.

Hence the worst-case delay as a result of admitting the new flow must be smaller than the requested delay bound D bound : D bound &gt; ^ D + ffi (4.3) 2. <p> Resource condition: the total resulting bandwidth usage due to the admis sion of the new flow does not exceed v. Similarly, the estimated aggregate traffic rate of the existing flows ^r is used so that the following must be satisfied: v &gt; ^r + (4.4) 4.2.2 Measurement Process In <ref> [JDSZ97] </ref>, the delay performance and the aggregate traffic are measured periodically and are adopted as the estimated worst-case delay ^ D and the estimated aggregate traffic ^r, respectively. Figure 4.2 depicts the measurement process, assuming all packets are of the same length. <p> A more conservative admission control can be achieved by using a larger value than the sampled value. For example, in the simulation study described in <ref> [JDSZ97] </ref>, if a single packet delay sample exceeds the delay estimate currently in use, the delay performance estimate value ^ D is changed to twice the value of this delay sample. 94 4.2.3 Insights The authors of [JDSZ97] have done an extensive simulation study on the performance of the proposed admission <p> For example, in the simulation study described in <ref> [JDSZ97] </ref>, if a single packet delay sample exceeds the delay estimate currently in use, the delay performance estimate value ^ D is changed to twice the value of this delay sample. 94 4.2.3 Insights The authors of [JDSZ97] have done an extensive simulation study on the performance of the proposed admission control scheme.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, enhancing the services to real-time multimedia applications without losing the high resource utilization that is currently supported in the packet-switched networks is a difficult problem. The vast majority of real-time multimedia applications|such as vic [MJ95], vat <ref> [JM] </ref>, nv [Fre94]|are quite different from standard data applications, and require service that cannot be delivered within the typical data service architecture [CSZ92]. The difficulty arises from the following three major characteristics associated with these multimedia applications. First is the higher QoS sensitivity compared with other applications.

If applied on multimedia applications, these schemes result in low resource 15 utilization. Therefore, research has been conducted to study measurement-based ad-mission control <ref> [JDSZ97, JSD97, TG97, Flo96, DKPS95] </ref>|making admission control decisions based on the measured network traffic and performance|to achieve higher admission ratio and higher resource utilization. However, there is no existing measurement-based scheme that considers the diversified packet loss tolerances of the applications. <p> Then in Section 4.1.2, we describe our focus of research on this topic. 4.1.1 Existing Admission Control Approaches Generally, there are two basic approaches to admission control: parameter-based and measurement-based <ref> [JSD97] </ref>. The parameter-based approach is usually based on a priori traffic characteristics; therefore, the admission decision can 86 be achieved by formal analysis. <p> On the other hand, the measurement-based approach relies on the measurement of actual traffic load and performance in making admission decisions <ref> [JSD97] </ref>.

The measurement-based approach has gained considerable attention in the Internet research community in handling real-time multimedia applications. 88 Some work under this approach can be found in [JDSZ97, JSD97, TG97, Flo96, DKPS95].

The low priority flow is only served when there are no packets from the higher priority flows present at the switch. <p> In reality, more "important" flows are assigned higher priorities.

This also causes flows with different priorities to have an uneven tail probability|the probability of a packet being discarded due to the expiration of its delay bound.

Reference-contexts: The difficulty of capturing these variations severely limits the effectiveness and viability 27 of architectures for providing QoS control. Therefore very specific methods have been designed to adjust the QoS control for real-time video based on the traffic dynamics. In <ref> [KZ95] </ref>, a formal traffic analysis method is introduced to quantify the variability of video traffic. The method focuses on finding the exact upper bound of the traffic amount within a certain time interval, hence attempting to achieve the maximum resource utilization for a guaranteed delay service. <p> to flows with different combinations of delay bound and loss ratio QoS requirements. 2.3.1 Efficiency Study of OCP A 2.3.1.1 Comparison with Deterministic QoS Control Schemes Here we compare the achieved bandwidth utilization of OCP A with that of the following two deterministic schemes: peak rate resource allocation and D-BIND <ref> [KZ95] </ref>. Peak rate resource allocation reserves the resources based on the peak traffic rate of a source; while D-BIND pre-analyzes the source to model the traffic tightly, thereby reserving an amount of bandwidth that may be significantly lower than the flow's peak rate. <p> In all simulations the sources have the same QoS tuple fD = 20ms; L = 0:0g, and the switch has 15Mbps link speed and infinite buffers. The achieved U T % for peak rate resource allocation algorithm and the D-BIND algorithm are obtained from <ref> [KZ95] </ref>. <p> On the other hand, because OCP A is adaptive enough to respond to the traffic change, it performs well 61 62 even for unpredictable traffic. Therefore OCP A presents larger U T % increase over static VirtualClock when applied to sources transmitting the advertisement clip. In <ref> [KZ95] </ref>, these two traffic patterns are analyzed quantitatively and the authors point out that even with pre-analysis of the traffic, high bandwidth utilization is hard to achieve for non-repetitive style VBR traffic under static resource allocation. Their analysis focuses on achieving deterministic guaranteed QoS. <p> Admission control schemes like this can provide guaranteed QoS. But when the traffic is bursty|the average rates of the sources are significantly lower than the peak rates|the traffic characterization must be quite loose; therefore this inevitably results in low resource utilization [ZF94]. <ref> [KZ95] </ref> indicates that in order to provide guaranteed QoS, the achieved resource utilization largely depends on how tight is the modeling of the source traffic in a deterministic sense. When the source is "ill-behaved," a tight modeling is difficult to achieve. <p> For example, some proposed packetizing schemes for MPEG encoded data separate data from different frames into different packets so that a single packet loss will not affect more than one frame <ref> [LX95, KZ95] </ref>. The variety of these packetizing schemes demands that the mapping of application QoS to network QoS be flexible and tunable. Encoding/decoding scheme Different encoding/decoding schemes affect the mapping of QoS in several ways.

Reference-contexts: We agree that, in general, higher throughput results in better QoS. But in our opinion, it is not appropriate to consider throughput as one of the direct QoS parameters chosen explicitly by an application, especially for highly bursty traffic such as MPEG <ref> [LeG91] </ref> encoded video whose throughput requirements change drastically over time. To an application generating VBR traffic, the actual quantity of throughput may not be interesting, as long as the information can be delivered reliably in a timely fashion to enable live playback.

Reference-contexts: When the source is "ill-behaved," a tight modeling is difficult to achieve. In order to improve the utilization, various admission control schemes <ref> [ZK94, LP91, GAN91] </ref> have been proposed to support statistical QoS. These schemes attempt to achieve higher resource utilization by weakening the degree of QoS reliability [JDSZ97]. <p> In this approach, each flow is 87 allocated an effective bandwidth that is smaller than its peak rate; hence, higher resource utilization may be achieved. The admission control in <ref> [LP91] </ref> is based on the construction of a schedulable region, which is a hyper-plane of loads of limited classes of traffic where their requested QoS can be achieved. Similar to the approach in [ZK94], the a priori statistical characterization of traffic is used in the construction of the schedulable region. <p> But because of the many parameters (QoS requested, traffic mix, different scheduling algorithms) that influence the region, a universal approximation of the scheduling region does not appear to be easy to extract <ref> [LP91] </ref>. For real-time multimedia applications, the parameter-based approach can be problematic. First, multimedia traffic has diversified traffic characteristics; furthermore, these characteristics may be unknown in advance and unpredictable in the future over the lifetime of the application. This makes traffic modeling extremely difficult.

Reference-contexts: All rate-based schedulers support diverse throughput requirements from various applications by enforcing the resource usage according to each flow's average throughput reservation identified as the share i. This may not be appropriate for all applications. For example, <ref> [LX95] </ref> indicates that rate-based scheduling is not efficient for highly bursty traffic such as MPEG video, whose throughput requirements change drastically over time. Even though the shares in rate-based algorithms can be dynamically adjusted, how this should be done is still a research issue. <p> Even with the foundation of guaranteed QoS, this method can only provide statistical or predicted QoS. The overhead of this method includes the on-line modeling of the traffic and the communication required for renegotiation. Other work using dynamic resource allocation based on traffic change can be found in <ref> [GVSS96, Ada96, LX95] </ref>. In [GVSS96], the sender and the receiver of a video transmission session keep counters of transmitted/received packets and communicate with each other periodically for estimating the bandwidth needed. <p> The method proposed in [Ada96] predicts the bandwidth requirements for future frames using either adaptive or non-adaptive Least Mean Square (LMS) error linear predictors. The author has also presented several reservation schemes and pro-active congestion approaches. In <ref> [LX95] </ref>, the real-time traffic is modeled as a sequence of frames. Assuming within each frame the packets are generated at a constant rate, the first packet in each frame carries its traffic rate. <p> The reason is that being able to identify a packet containing the I or P or B bit stream of an MPEG encoded stream helps the network to discard only the less important information, thereby increasing its resilience to packet loss <ref> [LX95] </ref>. Nevertheless, our scheme is not limited in any way by this assumption. OCP A is a general solution for the QoS control problem and can be used with a variety of sources under different encoding and packetizing schemes. <p> For example, some proposed packetizing schemes for MPEG encoded data separate data from different frames into different packets so that a single packet loss will not affect more than one frame <ref> [LX95, KZ95] </ref>. The variety of these packetizing schemes demands that the mapping of application QoS to network QoS be flexible and tunable. Encoding/decoding scheme Different encoding/decoding schemes affect the mapping of QoS in several ways.

Reference-contexts: Therefore the actual QoS received by each Internet application|in terms of delay and throughput|varies over time. Providing a network-wide QoS like this enables high resource utilization 1 because of total resource sharing. This architecture has supported a wide variety of data applications in an extremely efficient manner <ref> [MESZ96] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, enhancing the services to real-time multimedia applications without losing the high resource utilization that is currently supported in the packet-switched networks is a difficult problem. The vast majority of real-time multimedia applications|such as vic <ref> [MJ95] </ref>, vat [JM], nv [Fre94]|are quite different from standard data applications, and require service that cannot be delivered within the typical data service architecture [CSZ92]. The difficulty arises from the following three major characteristics associated with these multimedia applications. First is the higher QoS sensitivity compared with other applications.

Reference-contexts: remainder of this section, we will discuss two major approaches that seek solutions of QoS control in packet-switched networks by resource isolation. 2.1.3 Rate-based Scheduling In rate-based scheduling schemes, a source's traffic is parameterized by a set of statistics such as average rate, maximum rate or peak rate, and burstiness <ref> [PG93] </ref>, which can be checked by the network along with the requested QoS to see if a new source can be accommodated. Once the new source is admitted, the network ensures that the agreed-upon values of traffic parameters are not violated. <p> In the meantime, efforts will be made by the network to satisfy the QoS of the source. Generally, a minimum throughput will be guaranteed for "well-behaved" sources. Therefore rate-based scheduling can be used to provide guaranteed QoS. In General Processor Sharing (GPS) <ref> [PG93] </ref>, a weighted proportion of server capacity is divided among the flows as 1; 2; :::; i; :::; n (1 i n and n is the number of flows sharing the resources). <p> The larger the value of i, the more bandwidth will be allocated to flow i; therefore, the better QoS treatment flow i will get. Rate-based scheduling is a flexible approach that can be used to support diversified QoS requirements. In <ref> [PG93] </ref>, Parekh and Gallager also prove that if leaky bucket source control [Tur86] is used, GPS guarantees a worst-case packet delay under certain bandwidth allocations. GPS usually does not require bandwidth allocation by peak rates and the guaranteed worst-case delay is valid even without shaping the traffic inside the network. <p> QoS condition: the admission of the new flow will not result in violation of the desired delay bound D bound . In <ref> [PG93] </ref>, it is proved that the worst-case queuing delay is the following if the aggregate rate of all the flows is within the link capacity : D = i=1 ffi i (4.1) The above worst-case delay is obtained by considering all n existing flows simultaneously dumping a one-time biggest burst of <p> The admission control decision is based on the worst-case traffic of the new flow ff, modeled by a token bucket fffi ff ; ff g as in Figure 4.1, where ffi ff is the token bucket size and ff is the token generation rate. <ref> [PG93] </ref> has proved that for a flow with token bucket parameters fffi ff ; ff g, the worst-case guaranteed queuing delay (not including the transmission time of the concerned packet) is ffi ff = ff , if a minimum bandwidth of ff is reserved for this flow.

Reference-contexts: Due to its absolute and inflexible preference in awarding resources to the high priority flows, HoL priority is not appropriate for satisfying diverse QoS requirements. 2.1.1.2 Head-of-Line Priority with Priority Jumping (HoL-PJ) Head-of-Line Priority with Priority Jumping (HoL-PJ) <ref> [PTW88] </ref> is introduced to solve the above problem in the original HoL priority scheme. In HoL-PJ, packets with the same delay bounds enter the same queue. <p> Except for this change, service is provided the same way as in the conventional HoL priority without preemption. It is proved that the tail probabilities in this scheme are the same for all the queues <ref> [PTW88] </ref>. Chen and Stavrakakis generalize the HoL-PJ to provide more diversified QoS in [CS96]. The analysis is done on two queues containing two classes of packets with different QoS requirements. <p> MLT supports efficient resource utilization and is extremely simple to implement. However, generally real-time applications have different deadlines, which requires keeping track of the laxity of each packet at the switch. Some variations of MLT are Shortest-Time-to-Extinction (STE) and Early-Due-Date (EDD) <ref> [PTW88] </ref>. STE discards packets which have violated their deadlines. It is shown that the STE policy minimizes the total number of packets which miss their deadlines [PTW88]. 2.1.2.2 First-In-First-Out+ (FIFO+) In [CSZ92], a revised version of FIFO called FIFO+ is introduced. FIFO+ enables full multiplexing in FIFO fashion. <p> Some variations of MLT are Shortest-Time-to-Extinction (STE) and Early-Due-Date (EDD) <ref> [PTW88] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Because the network situation is dynamically changing, this approach can never support a guaranteed or even a statistical QoS. Parameter-based approach In the parameter-based approach, the sources are described by either peak or average rates [FV90] or by a filter such as the token bucket <ref> [PZ95] </ref>. [FV90] shows that the upper bound of the traffic of the new incoming source and the worst-case behavior of the existing flows in the network can be calculated.

In this section, we focus on analyzing the second cost which results from the dynamic adjustment of resource shares. We associate the cost of dynamic adjustment of resource shares with two major operations: decreasing resources (CSE DW) operation and increasing resources (CSE UP) operation.

RSVP (Resource ReSerVation Protocol) is a signaling protocol designed to achieve resource reservation for QoS purposes. It is usually used before the start of a transmission to reserve the network resources needed on each switch on the transmission path. <p> Even though Resv message usually results in resource reservation actions on the switches on the path, RSVP is transparent to the issue of how the resource reservation is done at each network node. One Pass With Advertising (OPWA) <ref> [SB95] </ref> enhancement of RSVP enhances the ability of the Path messages to contain more information that may be useful to the receiver for QoS purposes. We adopted this enhancement in our design in end-to-end QoS distribution.

Reference-contexts: Conventional admission control schemes use the worst-case network condition to make admission control decisions. If applied on multimedia applications, these schemes result in low resource 15 utilization. Therefore, research has been conducted to study measurement-based ad-mission control <ref> [JDSZ97, JSD97, TG97, Flo96, DKPS95] </ref>|making admission control decisions based on the measured network traffic and performance|to achieve higher admission ratio and higher resource utilization. However, there is no existing measurement-based scheme that considers the diversified packet loss tolerances of the applications. <p> It relies on the measurement of actual traffic load in making admission control decisions [JSD97]. The measurement-based approach has gained considerable attention in the Internet research community in handling real-time multimedia applications. 88 Some work under this approach can be found in <ref> [JDSZ97, JSD97, TG97, Flo96, DKPS95] </ref>. In [Flo96], an equivalent bandwidth of a set of flows is used in making admission control decisions. The equivalent bandwidth is defined as the bandwidth such that the actual bandwidth requirement exceeds this value with probability at most * [Flo96]. <p> The equivalent bandwidth is defined as the bandwidth such that the actual bandwidth requirement exceeds this value with probability at most * [Flo96]. In the equivalent bandwidth calculation, the measured average rates of the flows are used.

In [JDSZ97], the sources are modeled with token buckets.

Reference-contexts: Admission control schemes like this can provide guaranteed QoS. But when the traffic is bursty|the average rates of the sources are significantly lower than the peak rates|the traffic characterization must be quite loose; therefore this inevitably results in low resource utilization <ref> [ZF94] </ref>. [KZ95] indicates that in order to provide guaranteed QoS, the achieved resource utilization largely depends on how tight is the modeling of the source traffic in a deterministic sense. When the source is "ill-behaved," a tight modeling is difficult to achieve.

GPS is a rate-based scheduler that was discussed in Section 2.1|the 39 related work in scheduling. It is designed to support diverse throughput require-ments from various applications by enforcing the bandwidth usage according to each flow's allocated bandwidth share. <p> If a flow indeed sends packets according to a mean rate that is the same as the allocated bandwidth, its VirtualClock reading should be in the vicinity of the real time <ref> [Zha90] </ref>. In actual implementations, VirtualClock schedules packets from different flows according to their VC (VirtualClock) values, which are advanced either with a tick time when a new arrival comes from this flow or advanced by the real time. <p> This feature allows VirtualClock to support statistical multiplexing. In summary, VirtualClock only orders packet transmission without changing the statistical sharing nature of 40 packet switching|the network forwards all packets as long as resources are avail-able <ref> [Zha90] </ref>. Firewall property Ordering packet transmission by VC values ensures that, although an aggressive flow may take up idle resources, it cannot disturb the QoS of other flows. Flows whose traffic rates follow the allocated bandwidth shares will not be affected by the aggressive flows. <p> As we can see, for both schedulers, when the total buffer resource increases, the packet loss caused by lack of buffers decreases and the packet loss caused by 8 The original VirtualClock presented in <ref> [Zha90] </ref> does not prevent buffer sharing. What we use here is just one implementation of VirtualClock in which the buffer partitioning is fixed. 48 excessive delay increases. This is reasonable because, when the total buffer resource is scarce, it is more likely to drop packets due to overflowing buffer.

Reference-contexts: When the source is "ill-behaved," a tight modeling is difficult to achieve. In order to improve the utilization, various admission control schemes <ref> [ZK94, LP91, GAN91] </ref> have been proposed to support statistical QoS. These schemes attempt to achieve higher resource utilization by weakening the degree of QoS reliability [JDSZ97]. <p> In order to improve the utilization, various admission control schemes [ZK94, LP91, GAN91] have been proposed to support statistical QoS. These schemes attempt to achieve higher resource utilization by weakening the degree of QoS reliability [JDSZ97]. The admission control in <ref> [ZK94] </ref> does not provide a worst-case scenario, instead it guarantees a bound on the probability of QoS violation based on the a priori statistical characterization of traffic. <p> The admission control in [LP91] is based on the construction of a schedulable region, which is a hyper-plane of loads of limited classes of traffic where their requested QoS can be achieved. Similar to the approach in <ref> [ZK94] </ref>, the a priori statistical characterization of traffic is used in the construction of the schedulable region. The admission control decision can be made by comparing the current network condition with the pre-constructed schedulable region, and statistical QoS can be provided to each class of traffic.

Reference-contexts: They have also pointed out that tight modeling is difficult to achieve for "ill-behaved" sources|sources that present long-term traffic variability. In that case, the increase in resource utilization using this method is rather small. In their subsequent work in solving this problem <ref> [ZK95] </ref>, a renegotiation process is introduced to renegotiate traffic specification and QoS with the network on a per segment basis. This change allows the worst-case segments to be separated from the other more average-case segments of the source, therefore achieving higher utilization. <p> It is believed that most of the real-time applications have sufficient adaptiveness to survive occasional service deterioration, especially if the service deterioration is controlled to happen infrequently <ref> [CSZ92, ZK95, JDSZ97, Flo96] </ref>. Many multimedia 89 applications should thus benefit from measurement-based admission control because of the high utilization it provides.
