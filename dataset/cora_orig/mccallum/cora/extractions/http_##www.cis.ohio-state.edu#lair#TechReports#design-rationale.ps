Abstract: Design rationale is a record of design activity: of alternatives available, choices made, the reasons for them, and explanations of how a proposed design is intended to work. We describe a representation called the Functional Representation (FR) that has been used to represent how a device's functions arise causally from the functions of its components and their interconnections. We propose that FR can provide the basis for capturing the causal aspects of the design rationale. We briefly discuss the use of FR for a number of tasks in which we would expect the design rationale to be useful: generation of diagnostic knowledge, design verification and redesign.
