Title: From Points to Intervals  
Author: Robin Hirsch 
Date: March 16, 1995  
Abstract: Representable relation algebras are characterised by a certain property of networks. Representations of relation algebras can be further classified as homogeneous or universal. These properties are also characterised by properties of networks properties (amalgamation and joint embedding properties). For the homogeneous, universal case a method of constructing interval algebras from point algebras is given. This is applied to give a metric algebra of intervals, a relation algebra capable of expressing Allen's interval relations as well as metric constraints.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction and Background A number of temporal reasoning devices can be classified as relation algebras (see [9]). These include the Allen Interval Algebra [1], a point-based version of Allen's Algebra and the metric point system of Dechter, Meiri and Pearl <ref> [4] </ref>. These have been used extensively in planning [2, 14, 5]. However, the point-based systems suffer from a lack of expressive power and Allen's Interval Algebra is intractable and does not represent metric information. <p> The composition table is much simpler, for example &lt; fl &lt;= f&lt;g; &lt; fl &gt;= f&lt;; =; &gt;g. It has been shown that the consistency checking problem for the point algebra can be solved by a cubic-time algorithm [15]. The metric system M in <ref> [4] </ref> also uses networks, but here the arcs are labelled by an interval of rational numbers. The intended meaning of the arc is that a (y x) b 1 i.e. the directed distance from x to y lies inside the interval. <p> Throughout this paper I, will stand for the Allen Interval Algebra, P the point algebra and M the metric point system of <ref> [4] </ref>. The remainder of this paper is divided up as follows. In section 2 relation algebras are treated axiomatically as abstract structures. In section 3 networks are used to summarise a complete, but infinite, axiom schema. This network property is necessary and sufficient for a relation algebra to be representable. <p> Section 5 applies this result to the metric system of Dechter, Meiri and Pearl. An algebra of intervals in which metric constraints are also expressed is defined, thus combining the qualitative expressions of Allen's Interval Algebra with the quantitative expressive power of <ref> [4] </ref>. Finally, in a brief complexity sketch it is argued that this system is equivalent to competing systems, but with a uniform method of representation. 1 Open, closed or semi-open intervals can be dealt with. <p> Notation Let Net (A) be the class of all finite, atomic, transitively closed A-networks. Comments 1. In the planning literature <ref> [1, 15, 4] </ref> a network is considered as an example of a constraint satisfaction problem given a (transitively closed) network, usually with non-atomic relations on the arcs, the problem is to discover whether the network is globally consistent. <p> March 16, 1995 10 Theorem 3 Any non-singular RA A has a universal, homogeneous representation. PROOF: This was first proved in <ref> [4] </ref> (theorem 3.3). Here, we use the so-called regular representation which is defined like this. The domain of the representation is the set of atoms of A itself. <p> Definition A simple M -network is a transitively closed M -network with a single interval on each arc. (In the terminology of <ref> [4] </ref> this is called an STP.) Theorem 5 Any (transitively closed) simple M -network has the extension property. PROOF: Let N be such a network and let M be any subnetwork. <p> Now, each pair S m , S mfl intersect, otherwise the triangle (m; mfl; n) would not be transitively closed. So fS m : m 2 M g is a finite set of convex sets of rationals which 5 In <ref> [4] </ref> this property is called decomposability. March 16, 1995 11 intersect pairwise. <p> But if we restrict to certain fragments of the full language we obtain the following results. * A network with only elementary metric interval relations on the arcs (no disjuncts) can be checked in cubic time. This follows from the proof in <ref> [4] </ref> that computing the transitive closure of an M-network with only one interval on each arc (in their terminology an STP), can be done in cubic time, and computes the minimal network. * If all the relations on the arcs of the network are pure Allen relations i.e. equivalent to a <p> This allows us to construct a metric interval algebra from the metric system M. This representation permits the expressing of Allen type disjuncts like if&lt;; &gt;gj. It is thus more expressive than other systems that allow quantitative, metric information. As with these systems <ref> [4] </ref> the propagation algorithm will be complete and of cubic complexity if there are no disjuncts buts its performance in general is intractable. March 16, 1995 21

Reference-contexts: It is natural to ask whether these axioms, or indeed any other finite axiom set, are complete over that class. Lyndon <ref> [11] </ref> showed that the answer is negative 2 : there are (abstract) relation algebras i.e. structures satisfying axioms 1 to 7 above which are not isomorphic to any concrete algebra of binary relations. <p> If a b fl c then it is necessary to show that the triangle T 4 In this part the existence of a class K with TAP is equivalent to the infinite set of conditions given in <ref> [11] </ref>. However the condition on networks is conceptually more clear and this conditions is shown here to be necessary and sufficient for a countable set of atoms, as well as the finite case covered by Lyndon.

Reference-contexts: These conditions are rather complex and in section 3 we present an equivalent, though conceptually simpler, set of conditions in terms of networks and show that this is complete for the countable case too. 2 McKenzie <ref> [12] </ref> provides the simplest example of a relation algebra which does not possess a representation.
