Abstract: Compressed digital video is one of the most important traffic types in future integrated services networks. However, a network service that supports delay-sensitive video imposes many problems since compressed video sources are variable bit rate (VBR) with a high degree of burstiness. In this paper, we consider a network service that can provide deterministic guarantees on the minimum throughput and the maximum delay of VBR video traffic. A common belief is that due to the burstiness of VBR traffic, such a service will not be efficient and will necessarily result in low network utilization. We investigate the fundamental limits and tradeoffs in providing deterministic performance guarantees to video and use a set of 10 to 90 minute long MPEG-compressed video traces for evaluation. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we are able to show that a deterministic service can be provided to video traffic even while maintaining a high level of network utilization. We first consider an ideal network environment that employs the most accurate video traffic characterizations,

Reference-contexts: Throughout this study we assume that service guarantees are deterministic, i.e., no guarantees are ever violated. Any network that offers service guarantees, especially guarantees on the maximum delay, requires admission control tests for new connection and policing mechanisms for existing connections <ref> [1, 4, 8, 9] </ref>. Admission control tests determine if the network has sufficient resources to accommodate a new connection without degrading the service of existing connections. The admission tests for a new connection are based on a characterization of the expected traffic for the new connection.

The (; ) model <ref> [3] </ref> describes traffic in terms of a rate factor and a burstiness factor such that during any time interval of length t, the traffic from a connection is less than + t. <p> To ensure that the policing mechanisms can monitor and control traffic at high data rates, the complexity of the traffic model is strictly limited. In <ref> [3] </ref> it was shown that a traffic model with a piece-wise linear concave traffic constraint function can be policed by a fixed number of leaky buckets. <p> Here we consider the following well-known scheduling disciplines at a packet scheduler for a set N of connections: First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Static Priority (SP), and Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF). Each of these disciplines has been investigated for use in bounded delay services <ref> [3, 4, 12, 20] </ref>. First-Come-First-Served (FCFS): FCFS schedulers transmit all packets in the order of their arrival. Since the maximum delay in a FCFS scheduler is the same for all connections j 2 N , all connections have an identical delay bound d. <p> Formal derivations of these tests can be found in <ref> [3, 12] </ref>. Since the exact admission test for an SP scheduler is computationally very complex, Table 3 presents less accurate tests 1 In the tables, s k denotes the maximum transmission time of any packet on connection k. <p> Note that this traffic constraint function A fl (t) is guaranteed to be concave and can thus be policed with an N -level leaky bucket <ref> [3, 10] </ref>. We now present an algorithm that approximates the empirical envelope E by the (~; ~) model. For the algorithm we assume that the values of the empirical envelope are available up to some time limit t 9 Input: An empirical envelope E and a time t . <p> Here sufficient tests for admission control are considerably simpler to calculate than the necessary and sufficient tests. In an empirical evaluation we demonstrated that the sufficient admission control test of [21] resulted in significantly lower utilization than for the necessary and sufficient test of <ref> [3, 12] </ref>; however, a different sufficient admission control test from [12] resulted in a utilization that closely approximated that of the ideal case. 20

Reference-contexts: Of the many traffic classes in future B-ISDN networks, delay-sensitive Variable Bit Rate (VBR) video traffic poses a unique challenge. Since the service is delay-sensitive, the network must support a resource reservation scheme <ref> [4] </ref> that allocates network resources for each VBR video stream. However, the burstiness of VBR video traffic makes it difficult to determine the amount of resources required. <p> Throughout this study we assume that service guarantees are deterministic, i.e., no guarantees are ever violated. Any network that offers service guarantees, especially guarantees on the maximum delay, requires admission control tests for new connection and policing mechanisms for existing connections <ref> [1, 4, 8, 9] </ref>. Admission control tests determine if the network has sufficient resources to accommodate a new connection without degrading the service of existing connections. The admission tests for a new connection are based on a characterization of the expected traffic for the new connection. <p> Recently, several methods have been proposed that express the burstiness of VBR traffic sources in terms of a worst-case description. In particular, the (x min ; x ave ; I; s) model <ref> [4] </ref> and the Deterministic Bounding Interval Dependent or D-BIND model [10] have been shown to significantly increase the number of admitted connections when the traffic is bursty. In this study, we analyze the fundamental limits and practical tradeoffs in providing deterministic performance guarantees to VBR video. <p> In practice, a source specifies its traffic characterization with a parameterized model. The parameterized deterministic traffic model then defines a traffic constraint function that bounds the source. For example, in the (x min ; x ave ; I; s) model <ref> [4] </ref>, x min is the minimum packet inter-arrival time, x ave is the maximum average packet inter-arrival time over any time interval of length I, and s is the maximum packet size. This worst-case parameterization of a source has an associated traffic constraint function given in Table 1. <p> Here we consider the following well-known scheduling disciplines at a packet scheduler for a set N of connections: First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Static Priority (SP), and Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF). Each of these disciplines has been investigated for use in bounded delay services <ref> [3, 4, 12, 20] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Next, we describe how to obtain the empirical envelope from a given video trace. Additionally, we show how parameters for the (~; ~) model can be obtained from the empirical envelope. In this paper, we investigate VBR video traffic that is generated according to the MPEG compression algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>. An MPEG coder generates three types of frames: I frames that use intraframe compression, and P and B frames that are transmitted between I frames that use interframe compression. <p> While P frames (predicted frames) are coded based on only past frames, B frames (bidirectional frames) are coded based on both past and future frames. Thus, I frames exploit spatial locality, while P and B frames exploit temporal locality. More details of the MPEG algorithm may be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. Figure 1 shows an MPEG-compressed video trace of advertisement sequences with the frame pattern IBBPBB. The behavior of the coder is clearly 7 visible from the dynamics of the trace.
