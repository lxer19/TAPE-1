Reference-contexts: Surfaces at appropriate potentials act as depressed collectors. Symmetry boundary conditions, including periodic, mirror and axially symmetric systems are also of importance. 2.2.4. Mover Design Statement 02/01/93 DESIGN SPECIFICATION 7 The mover updates the particle velocities and positions by integrating the relativistic equation of motion for each particle <ref> [1] </ref> . PIC++ will accomodate particles in two spatial dimensions, three velocity dimensions. The gyro motion is fully described. A relativistic second-order time-centered Boris mover is used. <p> See Birdsall and Langdon <ref> [1] </ref> , Chapters 8-9 for basics, Chapter 10 for an energy conserving model, and Chapter 15 for detailed electromagnetic approaches, especially Section 15-6 on conservation of charge. We are presently studying a new approach based on the integral forms of the Maxwell equations. <p> Making simple test beds to explore various weighting schemes is one of our planned steps. 2.2.6. Field Solver Maxwell's full set of equations define the electromagnetic fields, completed by the boundary conditions. The field solve is a second order accurate, time-centered scheme <ref> [1] </ref>. The electric and magnetic fields are gridded at half-cell offsets, with the magnetic fields known at halftime steps and the electric fields known at integral time steps. Accurate solution of Maxwell's equations may require a partial divergence correction for the electric field.
