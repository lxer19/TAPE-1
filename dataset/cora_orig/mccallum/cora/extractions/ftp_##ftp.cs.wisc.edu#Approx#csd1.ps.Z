Abstract: Given a multivariate compactly supported distribution , we derive here a necessary and sufficient condition for the global linear independence of its integer translates. This condition is based on the location of the zeros of b = The Fourier-Laplace transform of . The utility of the condition is demonstrated by several examples and applications, showing in particular, that previous results on box splines and exponential box splines can be derived from this condition by a simple combinatorial argument.

Reference-contexts: Define (x 1 ; x 2 ) = (x 1 ) fl (x 2 ) fl (x 1 + x 2 ) : It is well known (see <ref> [BH 1 ] </ref>) that (x 1 ; x 2 ) is the hat function (with support similar to that drawn in Fig. 3.1) and therefore K = 0.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, ff satisfies (3.4) and hence (3.3). We conclude that N () = ; and application of Theorem 1.1 (b) completes the proof. In our last example we prove the global linear independence of the integer translates of a bivariate function which was examined in <ref> [BH 2 ] </ref>. Example 3.3. Let t be the characteristic function of the triangle with vertices (0; 0); (1; 0); (1; 1).

Reference-contexts: Since dim Q = dim ker L = n we conclude Q = ker L. Remark 2.1. The above corollary shows that for univariate , K "` p = 0 for 1 p &lt; 1, thus contradicting Proposition 4.10.2 of <ref> [DM 2 ] </ref>. Corollary 2.5. Assume s = 1, q 2 Q and q is not an exponential polynomial (i.e., a linear combination of products of exponentials by polynomials). Then the linear span of fE ff qg ff2ZZ is dense in Q. Proof.

Reference-contexts: Obviously, every space of the type K ; 2 E 0 (IR s ) is a closed shift invariant subspace of Q. The result we need about shift invariant subspaces of Q is recorded in the following theorem which is due to Lefranc. Theorem 1.2. (Lefranc, <ref> [Le] </ref>). Every non-trivial closed shift invariant subspace of Q contains an exponential q (ff) = z ff . <p> Proof. By the assumption on q, it does not lie in any kernel of a difference operator with constant coefficients, therefore Corollary 2.4 shows that q does not lie in any proper closed shift invariant subspace of Q. Finally, we mention that Lefranc also proved in <ref> [Le] </ref> that every closed shift invariant subspace Q Q contains a dense subset spanned by exponential polynomials. Some of the results here could be alternatively obtained with the aid of this stronger claim. 7 3. Examples and Applications.

Reference-contexts: The main aim of this note is to establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the global linear independence of the integer translates of a 2 E 0 (IR s ). The methods here make an essential use of distribution theory. For background material we refer to <ref> [T] </ref>, which is also the source for some of the notations. The utility of this necessary and sufficient condition is demonstrated by several examples and applications. <p> Then (f ) = ff2ZZ s Proof. By Poisson's summation formula (see e.g., [Y;p.149]) X g (ff) = ff2ZZ s Since is of compact support, it is continuous on C 1 (IR s ) (see <ref> [T; pp.255-257] </ref>), hence the definition of shows that (f ) = ( ff2ZZ s Fix x 2 IR s and let g (y) = e iy f (x + y). <p> If f g 0 then x 2 supp g only if f (x) = 0. Proof of Lemma 2.2. Since f 2 C 1 (IR s ), it is a multiplier in D 0 (IR s ) (see <ref> [T; p.250] </ref>), and hence f g is well defined. Assume x ffi 2 IR s and f (x ffi ) 6= 0. Since f is continuous, there exists a neighbourhood of x ffi such that f (x) vanishes nowhere in the closure of .
