Reference-contexts: The matrix U 1 of (3.5) can be found by computing the QR decomposition of B 1:5 1 . Programs for computing both decompositions can be found in LINPACK [3] or LAPACK <ref> [1] </ref>. Unfortunately, this approach can be computationally expensive. Consider, for example, the case where all the blocks are 1 fi 1. Then the first step of the reduction requires the computation of the singular value decomposition of A, which is of order n.

Reference-contexts: Since a singular value decomposition requires O (n 3 ) time to compute, the decomposition of A and B will require O (n 4 ) time. Beelen and Van Dooren <ref> [2] </ref> have given an algorithm that circumvents these difficulties. Their approach is to first reduce A to an echelon form resembling our (3.1) and then to reduce B to triangular form while preserving the echelon form.

Reference-contexts: At this point the leading principal submatrix of order m 1 is small, and we have effectively computed the matrix A 1:5 of (3.4). The process sketched above can be implemented efficiently using plane rotations (for details of the use of plane rotations see <ref> [4, pp. 201ff.] </ref>). The reduction of x T to e 1 is done by a sequence of rotations P n1;n , P n2;n1 , : : : , P 12 , the rotation P i;i+1 using the ith element to eliminate the (i + 1)th.

Reference-contexts: Laurent Expansion of Pencils norm one, such that * = kx T is as small as possible (here k k is the usual Euclidean vector norm.) Since A is upper triangular, an approximately optimal vector may be obtained in O (n 2 ) time by means of a condition estimator <ref> [6] </ref>. We will assume that * is small enough so that x 1 can be regarded effectively as a null vector of A. The next step is to find orthogonal matrices U and V such that x T U = e T and U T AV is upper triangular.

Reference-contexts: The approach is effective because one can work with blocks that are the size of the blocks in the echelon form. Here we return to the original algorithm and give a different implementation based on ideas from <ref> [11] </ref>. Specifically, we will show that if we can compute null vectors of A, then we can perform the reduction in the proof of Theorem 3.1 column by column.

Reference-contexts: The first, given in x2, has the advantage of simplicity, which it attains by discarding the machinery that Langenhop uses to state his necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the Laurent expansion. The second proof, given in x3, is based on a matrix decomposition of Van Dooren <ref> [12] </ref>. The proof yields new conditions for the existence of the Laurent expansion, provides explicit bases for the spaces of the projections P and ~ P , and furnishes the basis for an algorithm to compute the expansion itself. <p> In deriving our decompositions (there are actually two), we shall follow a strategy common in numerical analysis. First we shall see how far we can reduce the pencil using orthogonal transformations. This will give us a decomposition, first introduced in a more general form by Van Dooren <ref> [12] </ref>, from which the structure of the Laurent series can be determined in a stable manner. Then we will see how much further we can reduce the pencil using nonorthogonal transformations. The resulting decomposition will give us the wherewithal to compute the Laurent expansion. <p> Projections have the theoretical advantage of leaving objects in the original coordinate system. But decompositions have computational advantages, to which we now turn. 4. An Algorithm In principle, the proof Theorem 3.1 prescribes an algorithm | a special case of the algorithm found in <ref> [12] </ref> | that can be implemented with off-the-shelf software. For example, the matrix V 1 , whose initial columns span the null space of A [cf. (3.4)], can be found by computing the singular value decomposition of A.
