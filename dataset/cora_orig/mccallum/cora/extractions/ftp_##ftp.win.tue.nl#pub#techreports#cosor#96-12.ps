Reference-contexts: Perhaps the most well-known traffic regulation scheme is the credit manager or leaky bucket, (see e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>, [7] or [11]). The basic operation of this scheme is simple. Input cells first enter a buffer before entering the network. In order for a cell at the head of the line of this buffer to enter the network, it must obtain a token from a token pool. <p> Once again, this scheme permits for a short period of time a higher rate than the guaranteed rate, however this rate will never exceed the peak rate. In a number of papers a performance analysis of the credit manager has been given (see <ref> [3] </ref>, [7] and [11]). However, an exact analysis of the two-level traffic shaper becomes much harder. This is due to the fact that for the credit manager at any moment in time either the data buffer or the token pool is empty.

Reference-contexts: n 0, we write R n (x) = r 1 P n + 1 + 2x 1 ! and see that R 0 (x) = 1; R 1 (x) = 2x + (1 + r) ; so that fR n (x)g constitutes a sequence of perturbed Chebysev polynomials, see, e.g., <ref> [4] </ref> or [10]. <p> Since &gt; ae fl n!1 n (r) = 1 + r we have (1 + r) q = 1 &lt; 1, and from <ref> [4, p. 205] </ref> we subsequently conclude that the sequence i n , n = 1; 2; : : : ; where i n is the smallest zero of R n (x), constitutes a strictly decreasing sequence which converges as n ! 1 to 2 (1 + r) + 1 + r

Reference-contexts: With B N denoting the length of a busy period of an M=M=1=N -system with arrival rate and service rate 1 , we have E [B N ] = @ + ! 2 1 1 cf. Cooper <ref> [5, p. 238] </ref>. Clearly, to have stability of the content of the credit buffer it is necessary and sufficient for the average amount of credit accumulated in an idle period to be smaller than the average amount of credit spent in a busy period (given enough credit).

Reference-contexts: Using these fractions of time, performance characteristics such as, e.g., the mean number of customers in the system and the mean sojourn time can be obtained by application of PASTA and Little's law. Remark 6.1 The matrix-geometric approach developed by Neuts <ref> [9] </ref> is also very well suited to analyze the system with finitely many portions of credit. In particular, the corresponding rate matrix R can be solved exactly (by a simple recursion).
