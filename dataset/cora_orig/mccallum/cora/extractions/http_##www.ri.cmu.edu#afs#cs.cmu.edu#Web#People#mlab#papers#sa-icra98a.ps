Abstract: Parts orienting, the process of bringing parts in initially unknown orientations to a goal orientation, is an important aspect of automated assembly. Bowl feeders used in industry rely on a sequence of mechanical operations, without using sensors, to orient parts. In our work, we use partial information sensors along with mechanical operations to eliminate uncertainty in part orientation. We show that sensor-based orienting plans need O(m) operations, where m is the maximum number of states with the same sensor value. We characterize the relation between part shape, orientability, and recognizability to identify conditions under which a single plan can orient and recognize multiple part shapes. We describe implemented planners and experiments to demonstrate generated plans.

Grossman and Blasgen [12] used a tilted tray to bring objects to a finite number of orientations and distinguished them with a tactile probe. <p> We first show that unlike the ra dius function, the push function and push-diameter function do not uniquely define the shape of a convex polygon. Theorem 1 Two convex polygons have the same radius function if and only if they have the same shape. Proof: See (Akella <ref> [1] </ref>). 2 Theorem 2 There is an infinite set of non-similar convex polygons having the same push function. Proof: Any convex polygon shares the same push function with an infinite set of similar polygons. <p> Two parts are distinguishable if there exists an action sequence such that the output strings of stable orientation diameter values for the two parts differ. Lemma 4 (Akella <ref> [1] </ref>) Two parts with identical push-diameter functions are orientable but not distinguishable. Theorem 5 Two parts with different push-diameter functions are orientable and distinguishable if jDj &gt; 1, where D is the set of distinct diameter values of all stable orientations of the two parts.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A parts orienting system must bring randomly oriented parts to goal orientations for assembly. Bowl feeders, widely used in industry, rely on mechanical operations to orient parts (Boothroyd et al. <ref> [4] </ref>). While very effective, bowl feeders are not reconfigurable. It can take a couple of months to design a feeder for a new part or to discover the part cannot be oriented. So there is a need for flexible parts orienting systems with characterizable capabilities. <p> Canny and Goldberg [8] advocate the use of simple, inexpensive sensors and actuators for automation tasks. Parts feeding. Boothroyd et al. <ref> [4] </ref> describe parts orienting devices for automated assembly, including vibratory bowl feeders. The SONY APOS parts feeder (Shirai and Saito [18]) uses a vibrating pallet with nests designed to trap only parts in the correct orientation.

Push-align actions are specified by the angle the part is rotated through before being pushed, and can be grouped into equivalence classes.

Reference-contexts: Gold-berg's polynomial-time algorithm ([11]) applied to a push function yields a minimum length plan to orient a part up to symmetry in its push function. The plans are O (n) in length, where n is the number of stable edges (Chen and Ierardi <ref> [9] </ref>). s j is the open interval ( j i ; j i ), where i is the stable orientation of s i , and j and j are the left and right limits of the resting range of s j . rectangle, with the resulting stable states. <p> Parts with all states with the same diameter value and an asymmetric push function: This is the sensorless orienting case with a maximum plan length of 2n 1 steps (Chen and Ierardi <ref> [9] </ref>). 8.

The radius function (Gold-berg <ref> [11] </ref>) predicts the part rotation due to such a linear normal push. <p> The local minima of the radius function correspond to stable edges of the part. A part rotates to achieve a minimum radius and mass indicated by the black dot. Based on (Goldberg <ref> [11] </ref>). comes to rest with stable edges aligned with the fence. An edge is stable if the center of mass projects onto its interior. <p> A push maps the entire interval between two divergent orientations to the enclosed stable orientation. The radius function has a period of 2. Symmetry in part shape leads to periodicity in the radius function. 3.2 The Push and Push-Diameter Functions The push function (Goldberg <ref> [11] </ref>) is a mapping p : S 1 ! S 1 from the initial fence orientation relative to the part to the final fence orientation relative to the part after a push, assuming the part orientation is held constant. It is a monotonic step function with a period of 2.
