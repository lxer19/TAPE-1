Abstract: Semantic roles of words in natural languages are reflected by the contexts in which they occur. These roles can explicitly be visualized by the Self-Organizing Map (SOM). In the experiments reported in this work the source data consisted of the raw text of Grimm fairy tales without any prior syntactic or semantic categorization of the words. The algorithm was able to create diagrams that seem to comply reasonably well with the traditional syntactical categorizations and human intuition about the semantics of the words.

Reference-contexts: 1 Processing Natural Language with Self-Organizing Map It has earlier been shown that the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) can be applied to the visualization of contextual roles of words, i.e., similarities in their usage in short contexts formed of adjacent words <ref> [4] </ref>. This paper demonstrates that such relations or roles are also statistically reflected in unrestricted, even quaint natural expressions. The source material chosen for this experiment consisted of 200 Grimm tales (English translation). <p> This method, however, is only practicable in very small experiments. If the vocabulary is large as in the present experiments, we may then encode the words by quasi-orthogonal random vectors of a much smaller dimensionality <ref> [4] </ref>. To create a map of discrete symbols that occur within the sentences, each symbol must be presented in the due context. The context may consist of the immediate surroundings of the word in the text. <p> The context may consist of the immediate surroundings of the word in the text. Application of the self-organizing maps to natural language processing has been described earlier in, e.g., [2], [3], <ref> [4] </ref>, [5], and [6]. 2 Experiments 2.1 Source data In the present experiments the data consisted of a set of English translations of fairy tales collected by the Grimm brothers. <p> First, the language itself is not formal by any means. This choice of source data is a significant generalization compared with the artificially produced sentences earlier used in simple experiments (e.g. in <ref> [4] </ref>). Second, the contents of the texts are very diverse. 2.2 Preprocessing The texts of all tales were concatenated into one file. Punctuation marks were removed and all uppercase letters were replaced by the corresponding lowercase letters. The articles ("a", "an", "the") were also removed from the text. <p> In order to equalize the mapping for the selected 150 words statistically and to speed up computation, a solution used in <ref> [4] </ref> was to average the contexts relating to a particular "key".

The words are shown in their due position in the array; no symbols for "neurons" have been drawn. Linguistic categories other than verbs and nouns have been assigned to the words. Many words are ambiguous but usually only the most common category relating to the tales is presented. </title>
Reference-contexts: The positions of the words on the map are solely based on the analysis of the contexts performed by the SOM. Explicit lexical categorization of the words was made following the Collins Cobuild Dictionary <ref> [7] </ref> to help the reader in evaluation of the results. The general organization of the map reflects both syntactical and semantical categories. The most distinct large areas consist of verbs in the top third of the map, and nouns in the bottom right corner.
