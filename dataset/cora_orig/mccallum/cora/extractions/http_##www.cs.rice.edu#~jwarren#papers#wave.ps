Abstract: Multi-resolution analysis (MRA) produces a hierarchical basis for representing functions. This basis can be used to improve the efficiency of many algorithms for computing with those functions. Traditionally, these basis functions are translates and dilates of a single function. In this paper, we outline a generalization of MRA to those functions defined by binary subdivision schemes. Although the mathematical underpinnings of MRA are somewhat involved, the resulting algorithms are quite simple. We start with a brief intuitive description of how the method can be applied to decompose the polyhedral object shown in Figure 1(a). The main idea behind MRA is the decomposition of an object, in this case a polyhedron, into a low resolution part and a "detail" part. The low resolution part of the polyhedron in Figure 1(a) is shown in Figure 1(b). The vertices in (b) are computed as certain weighted averages of the vertices in (a). These weighted averages essentially implement a low pass filter denoted as A. The detail part consists of a collection of fairly abstract coefficients, called wavelet coefficients, that are also computed as weighted averages of the

Reference-contexts: For interpolating schemes, the method of the previous section also produces columns Q k that are multiples of e 2k . Therefore, this method can be viewed as a generalization of previous methods for interpolating schemes to the more general approximating case. Cohen, Daubechies and Feaveau <ref> [1] </ref> describe a method for creating bi-orthogonal wavelets. One component of this method is a construction that produces sparse filters banks if all of the columns of S are shifts of a single column (i.e. the subdivision scheme is uniform).

Reference-contexts: Typically, the initial filter banks are lifted such that applying the resulting sequence of analysis filters is numerically stable.

Reference-contexts: If the 2kth row of S is exactly e k for all k, then the subdivision matrix S defines an interpolating subdivision scheme. Previous methods for interpolating schemes such as <ref> [3] </ref> and [7] have suggested using an initial synthesis filter Q where Q k is exactly e 2k . For interpolating schemes, the method of the previous section also produces columns Q k that are multiples of e 2k .

Reference-contexts: Again, our method exactly reproduces these filter banks for the uniform case in addition to working in the non-uniform case. Finally, Dahmen and Micchelli <ref> [4] </ref> describe a method for creating banded matrices with banded inverses. Cast in our framework, this method produces essentially the same filter banks as our method.

Reference-contexts: 1 A matrix view of multi-resolution analysis The theory of multi-resolution analysis can be formulated in many ways. Standard MRA considers translates and dilates of a single basis function. <ref> [5] </ref> gives a fairly informal introduction into this area using linear algebra and matrices. The advantage of using linear algebra is that many of the concepts of MRA can be defined without resort to translation and dilation. Under this approach, MRA can be described for arbitrary nested spline spaces.
