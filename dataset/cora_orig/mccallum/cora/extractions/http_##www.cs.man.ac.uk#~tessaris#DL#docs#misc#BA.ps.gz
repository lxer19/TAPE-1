Reference-contexts: In the propositional case, elimination of the existentially quantified p amounts to generating all resolvents with p in the clause form of A. The resolvents represent all consequences of p and therefore p is no longer necessary <ref> (Ackermann, 1935) </ref>. This way one can have large databases of Boolean axioms, but for the actual problem at hand, the atomic decomposition takes into account only the relevant Boolean variables. 5.2.

Reference-contexts: For example in the algebra corresponding to the modal logic K, the finite model property yields that there is always a finite tree model as deep as the maximal number of nestings of modal operators occurring in the problem <ref> (Chellas, 1980) </ref>. For all modal terms with deeper nestings, the 2 versions become &gt; and the 3 versions become ?. The finiteness condition has to be analyzed for each class of algebras, but for may cases well known results can be exploited for this purpose. 7.

Reference-contexts: Boolean variables are implicitly existentially quantified. That means A is in fact short for 9p A if p does not occur in E . A is a propositional formula, and therefore the existentially quantified p can be eliminated using a quantifier elimination procedure <ref> (Gabbay and Ohlbach, 1992) </ref>. The result is some formula A 0 which is equivalent to 9p A , but does not contain p. In the propositional case, elimination of the existentially quantified p amounts to generating all resolvents with p in the clause form of A.

Reference-contexts: EXTENSIONS TO OTHER ALGEBRAS Many other algebras are extensions of Boolean Algebras. Relational Algebras provide composition and inverse of binary relations. Boolean Algebras with operators are the algebraic counterparts of modal logics <ref> (Jnsson and Tarski, 1951) </ref>. Both have useful applications in computer science and the knowledge representation area. In particular Boolean Algebras with operators bring extra dimensions into a logical system, for example time dependency.

Reference-contexts: This actually induces a homomorphism h F from A into the binary algebra 2. THEOREM 1.1. (Stone's Representation Theorem <ref> (Stone, 1936) </ref>).
