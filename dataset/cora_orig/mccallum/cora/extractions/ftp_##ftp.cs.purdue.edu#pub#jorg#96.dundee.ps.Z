Title: Smooth Blending of Basic Surfaces using Trivariate Box Splines  
Author: Jorg Peters Michael Wittman 
Date: October 23, 1996  
Abstract: To blend between basic implicitly defined CSG surfaces we propose to use the zero set of a spline in three variables. The resulting blend surface is generically curvature continuous, of algebraic degree four independent of the number of surfaces joined, and supports both point classification and efficient rendering. A detailed exposition of the 2D analogue blend construction is given.

However, this representation is clearly less efficient for many tasks than parametric spline-based surfacing. Our implementation is therefore specific to isolated blending applications. The proper intialization of the 3D blend volume is the key to a good blend surface.
