Title: Intelligent Text Handling Using Default Logic  
Author: Anthony Hunter 
Address: London SW7 2BZ, UK  
Affiliation: Department of Computing Imperial College  
Abstract: There is a need to develop more intelligent means for handling text in applications such as information retrieval, information filtering, and message classification. This raises the need for mechanisms for ascertaining what an item of text is about. Even though natural language processing offers the best results, it is not always viable. A less accurate, but more viable alternative, is to reason with keywords in the text. Unfortunately, classical reasoning is often inadequate for determining from some keywords what a text is about. In particular, it does not allow context-dependent interpretation of keywords. So for example, if some text has the keyword oil, it is usually also about minerals, though with exceptions such as when it has the keyword cooking. To address this kind of problem, we consider a model of aboutness based on default logic.

Reference-contexts: A number of variants of default logic have been proposed that provide a range of capabilities (for example [2, 3]) and relationships with probability theory are being established (for example <ref> [1, 7] </ref>). Preferences over default rules, such as for more specific defaults, can be handled directly using the justification condition on a rule, or by explicitly representing priorities over defaults (see for example [3]). Supporting technology for default logic is now being developed.

Reference-contexts: Basing the framework on default logic brings advantages. Default logic provides an efficient representation for context-dependent reasoning and handling of exceptions, and it is a well-understood formalism for representing uncertain information.

However, the approach lacks the facility for default reasoning, which as we discussed in section 2.3, is problematical. Conditional logics [20, 6] and terminological logics [13] have been proposed to relate information in items with information requests using logical implication. However, these approaches also lack adequate default reasoning capability.

The formalization differs significantly from the approach in this paper. For example, given that a sentence q is about t, their approach accepts that :p is also about t. 5 Developing the framework There are a number of ways this framework can be developed.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, formulae in M can be used to capture the reasoning behind such examples, and provide better positioning and preclusion rules. 6 Discussion Reasoning with keywords, and in particular ascertaining what keywords are about, are important issues in computing <ref> [11] </ref>. Clearly, the choice of keyphrase can significantly affect the quality of the text handling. For example, in information retrieval, the choice can affect the recall (the proportion of appropriate items that are retrieved) and the precision (the proposition of retrieved items that are appropriate).

For this we assume default logic <ref> [16] </ref>, and use it for meta-level reasoning about keyphrases. In particular, we assume the usual definition of a credulous extension for a default theory. In the following we use a relation about (ff; fi) to denote that the keyphrase ff is about the keyphrase fi. <p> Let (D,W) be a default theory formed from a partition of [ fitem (ff)g into elements from D and M respectively. The relation about (ff; fi) follows from iff there is an extension E of (D,W), according to Reiter's definition of default logic <ref> [16] </ref>, such that about (ff; fi) 2 E. By definition 3.10, the default theory (D; W ) is such that D contains the default inclusion rules and positioning rules, and W contains the exception formulae, the item formula, and the axioms for the about relation.
