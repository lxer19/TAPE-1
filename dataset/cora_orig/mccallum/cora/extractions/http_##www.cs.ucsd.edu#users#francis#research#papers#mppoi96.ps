Abstract: The Optical Transpose Interconnection System (OTIS) proposed in [13] makes use of free-space optical interconnects to augment an electronic system with non-local interconnections. In this paper, we show how these connections can be used to implement a large-scale system with a given network topology using small copies of a similar topology. In particular, we show that, using OTIS, an N 2 node 4-D mesh can be constructed from N copies of the N -node 2-D mesh, an N 2 node hypercube can be constructed from N copies of the N -node hypercube, and an (N 2 ; ff 2 ; c=2) expander can be constructed from N copies of an (N; ff; c) expanders, all with small slowdown. We also show how this expander construction can be used to build multibutterfly networks in a scalable fashion. Finally, we demonstrate how the OTIS connections can be used to produce a bit-parallel crossbar using many copies of bit-serial crossbars with minimal overhead.

Reference-contexts: For example, Valiant and Brebner [16] demonstrated that choosing random intermediate destinations prevent worst-case behavior in butterfly routing. Instead of using randomness on-line, results involving expanders utilize the random-like connections of the network to obtain good worst-case performance from deterministic routing algorithms. The AKS sorting network <ref> [1] </ref> used expander graphs to demonstrate that sorting could be done in parallel in c log N steps, for a sufficiently large value of c. More practical work on using expanders for routing has centered on the multibutterfly network studied in [15] and [12].

Reference-contexts: As the size of the required expander becomes larger, each chip requires more pins. The OTIS-Expander addresses this problem by producing an expander which can be partitioned into smaller pieces with manageable communications between the pieces. Graphs of this type, referred to as hierarchical expanders, were first considered in <ref> [2] </ref>. There, the authors show how one can build large expander graphs without increasing the number of different wires required. Essentially, each chip or module has a small number of cables, and each cable is made `thicker' as the number of nodes is increased. <p> Here, however, the optical transpose provides wires from every group of nodes to every other group of nodes without the explosion in wiring complexity that the construction in <ref> [2] </ref> sought to avoid. At the same time, that construction relies on many different, independent random choices of wiring. For the systems of boards connected by cables that the authors envisioned, this can be accomplished simply by connecting cables to boards in a random fashion.

Reference-contexts: The OTIS implementation offers several advantages for large scale interconnection networks. In general, optical technologies offer the advantage that the bandwidth and power requirement of a link are independent of the length of the link. For example, it has been shown in the literature <ref> [3, 8, 7] </ref> that for line lengths greater than a few millimeters free-space optical interconnections require less power for a given bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: In a manner similar to the shuffle-exchange graph, OTIS can be used to simulate the connectivity of a full hypercube. The OTIS-Hypercube network is also closely related to the hierarchical cubic network (HCN) proposed by Ghose and Desai <ref> [4] </ref>. The OTIS-Hypercube lacks the `diameter' links of the HCN, but this does not affect its ability to simulate the hypercube. Let n = log N .

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that for an optoelectronic MIN with N 2 inputs and N 2 outputs, the bandwidth and the power consumption of the network are optimized if the electronic switch planes are partitioned into N switches <ref> [10] </ref>. Thus, in an OTIS based parallel system, N 2 processor nodes are logically divided into groups of N nodes each. In practice, these groups can be thought of as being implemented by a single chip, or perhaps a small number of densely-connected chips.

Reference-contexts: OTIS-Hypercube The hypercube or n-cube is a versatile network for multiprocessor architectures. The hypercube architecture can simulate many other important topologies, such as meshes, meshes-of-trees, butterflies, and even PRAMs. Also many problems such as sorting and routing have efficient hypercube algorithms <ref> [11] </ref>. Several practical implementations of the hypercube are available as commercial products. However, it is difficult to construct larger-dimensional hyper-cubes using electronic technology.

In a butterfly network, the each bit of the destination address is used to divide the packets into two classes, and so each node has an up wire and a down wire to nodes in the next stage corresponding to these two possibilities.

Reference-contexts: explicit constructions of graphs of this kind, the graphs with the strongest form of this property (i.e., large values of c) are constructed by choosing graphs at random. (For a simple proof which shows that a randomly chosen d-regular graph is likely to have this property, see Section 5.3 of <ref> [14] </ref>.) For large enough values of N , one can show that a random choice of G is likely to have c close to d, for values of ff satisfying cff &lt; 1.

Reference-contexts: Scalable Multibutterfly Construction It may seem counterintuitive that random or near-random wiring could be helpful, there are several results which demonstrate that randomness or expander graphs are useful in many types of routing or sorting problems. For example, Valiant and Brebner <ref> [16] </ref> demonstrated that choosing random intermediate destinations prevent worst-case behavior in butterfly routing. Instead of using randomness on-line, results involving expanders utilize the random-like connections of the network to obtain good worst-case performance from deterministic routing algorithms.
