Abstract: Using an improved backtrack algorithm with sophisticated pruning techniques, we revise previous observations correlating a high frequency of hard to solve Hamiltonian cycle instances with the G n;m phase transition between Hamiltonicity and non-Hamiltonicity. Instead all tested graphs of 100 to 1500 vertices are easily solved. When we artificially restrict the degree sequence with a bounded maximum degree, although there is some increase in difficulty, the frequency of hard graphs is still low. When we consider more regular graphs based on a generalization of knight's tours, we observe frequent instances of really hard graphs, but on these the average degree is bounded by a constant. We design a set of graphs with a feature our algorithm is unable to detect and so are very hard for our algorithm, but in these we can vary the average degree from O(1) to O(n). We have so far found no class of graphs correlated with the G n;m phase transition which asymptotically produces a high frequency of hard instances.

Reference-contexts: When the graph is Hamiltonian, various researchers (Angluin & Valiant, 1979; Bollobas, Fenner, & Frieze, 1987) have proven the existence of randomized heuristic algorithms which can almost always find a Hamiltonian cycle in low-order polynomial time. In particular, it is shown <ref> (Bollobas et al., 1987) </ref> that there is a polynomial time algorithm HAM such that lim Pr (HAM finds a Hamilton cycle) = 8 &gt; : e e 2c 1 if c n ! 1 where m = n=2 (ln n + ln ln n + c n ). <p> In addition, efficient algorithms have been shown to solve these instances in polynomial time with high probability <ref> (Bollobas et al., 1987) </ref>. Since vertices of degree less than 2 are a trivially detectable counter-indicator, it is hardly surprising that asymptotically determining Hamiltonicity of graphs in G n;m is easy.

Reference-contexts: Since asymptotically the graph becomes Hamiltonian when an edge is added to the last degree 1 vertex <ref> (Bollobas, 1984) </ref>, any algorithm that checks for a minimum degree 2 will detect almost all non-Hamiltonian graphs. <p> These results should not be surprising, since it has been shown that asymptotically for randomly generated graphs, when the edge is added that makes the last vertex degree 2, then with high probability the graph is Hamiltonian <ref> (Bollobas, 1984) </ref>. In addition, efficient algorithms have been shown to solve these instances in polynomial time with high probability (Bollobas et al., 1987). Since vertices of degree less than 2 are a trivially detectable counter-indicator, it is hardly surprising that asymptotically determining Hamiltonicity of graphs in G n;m is easy.

Reference-contexts: Other features can lead to non-Hamiltonicity of course, such as k-cuts that leave k + 1 or more components <ref> (Bondy & Murty, 1976) </ref>, and these could require time proportional to n k to detect. Under the assumption that NP6=CO-NP there must also exist a set of non-Hamiltonian instances which have no polynomial proof of their status. <p> It consists mostly of special constructs tied together with some randomly chosen edges. It bears some resemblance to graphs such as the Meredith graph <ref> (Bondy & Murty, 1976) </ref> used to disprove certain theoretical conjectures. This graph remains difficult when we vary the neighbour selection heuristic or pruning techniques used by our backtrack algorithm. The graph we construct we refer to as the Interconnected-Cutset (ICCS ) graph.

Reference-contexts: Another relevant theoretical result is that there is a polynomial time algorithm which with probability going to one, finds some Hamiltonian cycle when a graph has a hidden 222 The G n;m Phase Transition is Not Hard for the Hamiltonian Cycle Problem Hamiltonian cycle together with extra randomly added edges <ref> (Broder, Frieze, & Shamir, 1994) </ref>. For the algorithm to work, the average degree of a vertex needs only be a constant. They claim the result can be easily extended to the case that the average degree is a growing function of n.

Reference-contexts: As the parameter is varied past a certain threshold value, the asymptotic probability of the existence of a solution switches sharply from zero to one. Phase transitions are commonly considered to be identified with hard subsets of a particular problem <ref> (Cheeseman, Kanefsky, & Taylor, 1991) </ref>. Many NP-C problems can be characterized by a `constraint' parameter which measures how constrained an instance is. <p> We do not check for components or articulation points during the recursive search. We expect the phase transition for biconnectivity to be very similar to the phase transition for Hamiltonicity <ref> (Cheeseman et al., 1991) </ref> and we expect the phase transition for minimum degree greater than 1 to be almost identical to the phase transition for Hamil-tonicity (Bollobas, 1984; Komlos & Szemeredi, 1983). Our experimental results matched these expectations very closely. <p> Any search procedure based on local information will have the same difficulty." <ref> (Cheeseman et al., 1991) </ref>. Unfortunately, while their observations were accurate, their observed hardness was due to their algorithms and the limited size of the graphs tested, not to intrinsic properties of the Hamiltonian cycle problem with respect to the phase transition on G n;m graphs.

Reference-contexts: With iterated restart, for the instance to remain hard the algorithm must make such mistakes with high probability. As a result, we expect fewer hard Hamiltonian instances. Random restarts are an integral part of randomized algorithms <ref> (Motwani & Raghavan, 1995) </ref> and are used frequently in local search and other techniques to escape from local optima (Johnson, Aragon, McGeoch, & Schevon, 1991; Langley, 1992; Selman, Levesque, & Mitchell, 1992; Gomes, Selman, & Kautz, 1998).

Reference-contexts: These two models are related <ref> (Palmer 1985) </ref>. For this paper we use the G n;m model. We do not consider mean or average run times in our definitions. The primary reason is that for exponentially small sets of exponentially hard instances, it is impractical to determine the average with any reasonable assurance.

Reference-contexts: The vertices of the graph correspond to the cells, and thus jV j = nm. Two vertices are connected by an edge if and only if it is possible to move from one vertex to the other by moving A steps along one axis and B along the other. <ref> (See Vandegriend, 1998 for more information about this problem.) </ref> For this graph class there is no easy way to define phase transitions since there is no clear parameter which separates the Hamiltonian graphs from the non-Hamiltonian graphs (although Vandegriend, 1998 shows that there are ways of identifying groups of non-Hamiltonian graphs).

Reference-contexts: We refer to a graph generated under this model as a Degreebound graph. In this paper we only consider graphs whose vertices are of degree 2 or 3. It is quite difficult to generate all graphs with a given degree sequence with equal probability <ref> (Wormald, 1984) </ref>. Instead, we adopt two variations which generate graphs by selecting available edges. In each case each vertex is assigned a free valence equal to the desired final degree.
