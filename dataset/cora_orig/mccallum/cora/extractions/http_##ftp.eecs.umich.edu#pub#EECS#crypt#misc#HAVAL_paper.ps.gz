Abstract: A one-way hashing algorithm is a deterministic algorithm that compresses an arbitrary long message into a value of specified length. The output value represents the fingerprint or digest of the message. A cryptographically useful property of a one-way hashing algorithm is that it is infeasible to find two distinct messages that have the same fingerprint. This paper proposes a one-way hashing algorithm called HAVAL. HAVAL compresses a message of arbitrary length into a fingerprint of 128, 160, 192, 224 or 256 bits. In addition, HAVAL has a parameter that controls the number of passes a message block (of 1024 bits) is processed. A message block can be processed in 3, 4 or 5 passes. By combining output length with pass, we can provide fifteen (15) choices for practical applications where different levels of security are required. The algorithm is very efficient and particularly suited for 32-bit computers which predominate the current workstation market. Experiments show that HAVAL is 60% faster than MD5 when 3 passes are required, 15% faster than MD5 when 4 passes are required, and as fast as MD5 when full 5 passes are required. It is conjectured that finding two collision messages requires the order of 2 n=2 operations, where n is the number of bits in a fingerprint.

Reference-contexts: Like many other hashing algorithms such as the MD family, SHS and FFT-hash, however, HAVAL could not be formally proved to be secure. Recently, Berson has proposed an attack to a single pass of MD5 <ref> [Ber92] </ref>. His method applies to a single pass of HAVAL as well. However, it seems to be unlikely that the attack might be extended to two or more passes.

Reference-contexts: His method applies to a single pass of HAVAL as well. However, it seems to be unlikely that the attack might be extended to two or more passes. We also 18 note that the attack by den Boer and Bosselaers <ref> [dBB94] </ref> on a single pass of MD5 is not directly applicable to HAVAL. It is conjectured that the best way to find a collision pair is by using the birthday attack. In such an attack, an attacker prepares two sets of 2 n=2 distinct messages, and calculates their fingerprints.

Reference-contexts: Despite the progress, little work has been done in the design of one-way hashing algorithms that can output fingerprints of variable length (except the proposal of Snefru, whose two-pass version has been found to be insecure <ref> [Mer90] </ref>). Such an algorithm would be more flexible and hence more suited for various applications where variable length fingerprints are required. The aim of this research is to design a one-way hashing algorithm that can output fingerprints of 128, 160, 192, 224 or 256 bits. <p> This work would be impossible without his insight in the construction of cryptographically useful Boolean funcitons.

Reference-contexts: When n = 2k for some k &gt; 1, the maximum non-linearity a function from V n to GF (2) can attain is 2 2k1 2 k1 . Such a functions is called a bent function <ref> [Rot76] </ref>.

In the same paper, Rothaus also proved that these are the only bent functions from V 6 to GF (2) which are linearly inequivalent in structure. <p> It was shown in <ref> [Rot76] </ref> that the above three sets of degree-3 terms can not be transformed into one another by linear transformation of coordinates. From this it follows that the three functions f 2 , f 3 and f 4 are linearly inequivalent.

Reference-contexts: These different lengths for fingerprints provide practical applications with a broad spectrum of choices. The algorithm, which we call HAVAL, uses some of the principles behind the design of the MD family. In addition, HAVAL makes an elegant use of Boolean functions recently discovered by Seberry and Zhang <ref> [SZ92] </ref>. <p> In <ref> [SZ92] </ref>, Seberry and Zhang presented a novel method for constructing Boolean functions that have the properties P1, P2 and P3. <p> x 3 ; x 2 ; x 1 ) x 0 x 1 x 2 x 3 x 0 x 5 x 0 These functions have a non-linearity of 2 6 2 3 = 56, which is in fact the maximum non-linearity of functions from V 7 to GF (2) <ref> [SZ92] </ref>. Now we show that these functions are linearly inequivalent in structure. We call the product of several coordinate variables a term. The degree of a term is the number of coordinate variables in it.
