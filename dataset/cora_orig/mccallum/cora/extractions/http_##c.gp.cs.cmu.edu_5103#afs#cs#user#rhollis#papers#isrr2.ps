Abstract: Recently, a new technology for stably levitating and controlling the position and orientation of a rigid body has been introduced. A unique feature is the use of Lorentz forces rather than the usual Maxwell forces as in magnetic bearings. The Lorentz force approach, which uses the force experienced by a conductor in a magnetic field, is seen to have several advantages. After an initial exploration phase and period of feasibility study, a number of potentially important applications are emerging. Among them are a way to provide fine compliant motion for assembly, to provide high fidelity force/torque feedback for teleoperation and virtual reality haptic interfaces, and to isolate sensitive payloads from environmental vibrational disturbances, either in space or on earth. In this paper we will discuss recent work intended to demonstrate the efficacy of Lorentz levitation technology for these application areas.

Reference-contexts: We will not discuss electric methods here, but instead will focus on magnetic methods. 1.1 Survey of magnetic methods In a long 1988 survey article Jayawant <ref> [1] </ref> listed the known technologies for magnetic levitation: (i) repulsion between magnets of fixed strength; (ii) levitation by forces of repulsion and diamagnetic materials; (iii) levitation with superconducting magnets or super conducting surfaces; (iv) levitation by repulsion forces due to eddy currents induced in a conducting surface or body princi pally <p> It is possible to create stable suspension forces in systems where &gt; 0 in some regions and &lt; 0 in other regions, where is an "effective" permeability. Small iron bodies have been suspended using this technique which also includes coils and su-perconductors <ref> [1] </ref>. In all of the above, only technique (viii), the principle of the magnetic bearing, has been shown to be practical enough for widespread application. 1.2 Magnetic bearings Magnetic bearings were extensively developed by Beams et al. [5] in 1946, principally used to support shafts rotating at high speeds.

Reference-contexts: Jayawant distinguishes between suspension where forces of attraction are used and levitation where the forces are repulsive. Techniques (i)|(ix) are examined below. Earnshaw <ref> [2] </ref> proved in 1842 that a Newtonian field cannot possess stable points of equilibrium|only saddle points.

Reference-contexts: In particular, if permanent magnets alone are used to suspend a body, there will be at least one direction of motion in unstable equilibrium. Technique (ii) provides very weak repulsion forces for materials such as bismuth <ref> [3] </ref> and is therefore of limited interest. The well-known Meissner effect which allows a magnet to be stably levitated over a superconducting surface (iii) has shown interest as a possible magnetic bearing with the recent introduction of high-T c materials.

Reference-contexts: A single example of technique (v) was cited: a thin rod undergoing zone refinement in an axial furnace was prevented from sagging by placement of the furnace in a magnetic field and running a current through the wire <ref> [4] </ref>. The method is stabilized by surface tension effects in the nearly molten rod. Techniques (vi) and (vii) use eddy current effects as in (iv) stabilized by the addition of fixed electrostatic or electromagnetic fields. Technique (viii) is the principle of the magnetic bearing (discussed below).

Reference-contexts: Examples of Lorentz actuators include loudspeaker voice coils and rotary disk drive actuators.

Reference-contexts: The slave manipulator is a conventional CRS A460 robot equipped with a Lorentz levitation wrist. The master is a Lorentz levitation wrist identical to the robot-mounted wrist. These wrists have a different actuator layout from the wrist described in Section 3| details can be found in <ref> [27] </ref>. Each of the wrists is equipped with force-torque sensors, enabling measurements of operator hand forces at the master and environment forces at the slave. Bilateral control can be achieved by a coordinated force controller that places the master and slave wrists in kinematic correspondence. <p> The velocity damping b can be a function of the environment force or stiffness <ref> [27] </ref>. In practice, small centering PD forces are added to each of the flotors to prevent them from drifting. <p> The continuous centering motion of the robot caused by c v x s is necessary to allow the slave flotor to be positioned at its nominal center after it has been placed against a stiff environment <ref> [27] </ref>. Since most manipulation tasks involve a coarse positioning phase and a fine motion contact phase, the small motion range of the master does not present a problem. 4.2 Teleoperation results The control and motion coordination approaches described above were implemented and shown to work well. <p> The ability to easily position the slave flotor via decoupled coarse-fine control, and excellent kines-thetic feedback were demonstrated <ref> [27] </ref>. For example, with only small errors while shaken by the operator as fast as possible (about 7 Hz). x s , (b) Hand and environment forces: f h and f e . control, with the master having a rate control dead-band from 3 mm to +3 mm. <p> It can be seen that the environment and hand forces are essentially the same, and only a small kinematic error is present. 8 The motivation for and a discussion of (8, 9), and other experimental results can be found in <ref> [27] </ref>. 4.3 Scaled teleoperation The Lorentz-force approach to teleoperation can also be used when motion scaling is required, as the achievable payload-to-mass ratio does not change substantially with scaling. A miniature Lorentz levitated wrist with a flotor weighing only 30 grams has been designed for motion-scaling experiments in microsurgery [28].

Reference-contexts: We will not discuss electric methods here, but instead will focus on magnetic methods. 1.1 Survey of magnetic methods In a long 1988 survey article Jayawant <ref> [1] </ref> listed the known technologies for magnetic levitation: (i) repulsion between magnets of fixed strength; (ii) levitation by forces of repulsion and diamagnetic materials; (iii) levitation with superconducting magnets or super conducting surfaces; (iv) levitation by repulsion forces due to eddy currents induced in a conducting surface or body princi pally <p> It is possible to create stable suspension forces in systems where &gt; 0 in some regions and &lt; 0 in other regions, where is an "effective" permeability. Small iron bodies have been suspended using this technique which also includes coils and su-perconductors <ref> [1] </ref>. In all of the above, only technique (viii), the principle of the magnetic bearing, has been shown to be practical enough for widespread application. 1.2 Magnetic bearings Magnetic bearings were extensively developed by Beams et al.

Reference-contexts: Jayawant distinguishes between suspension where forces of attraction are used and levitation where the forces are repulsive. Techniques (i)|(ix) are examined below.

Reference-contexts: In particular, if permanent magnets alone are used to suspend a body, there will be at least one direction of motion in unstable equilibrium.

Reference-contexts: The slave manipulator is a conventional CRS A460 robot equipped with a Lorentz levitation wrist. The master is a Lorentz levitation wrist identical to the robot-mounted wrist. These wrists have a different actuator layout from the wrist described in Section 3| details can be found in <ref> [27] </ref>. Each of the wrists is equipped with force-torque sensors, enabling measurements of operator hand forces at the master and environment forces at the slave. Bilateral control can be achieved by a coordinated force controller that places the master and slave wrists in kinematic correspondence. <p> The velocity damping b can be a function of the environment force or stiffness <ref> [27] </ref>. In practice, small centering PD forces are added to each of the flotors to prevent them from drifting. <p> The continuous centering motion of the robot caused by c v x s is necessary to allow the slave flotor to be positioned at its nominal center after it has been placed against a stiff environment <ref> [27] </ref>. Since most manipulation tasks involve a coarse positioning phase and a fine motion contact phase, the small motion range of the master does not present a problem. 4.2 Teleoperation results The control and motion coordination approaches described above were implemented and shown to work well. <p> The ability to easily position the slave flotor via decoupled coarse-fine control, and excellent kines-thetic feedback were demonstrated <ref> [27] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The gap requirements for vibration isolation on the Space Shuttle flights have been evaluated by integrating STS-40 acceleration data filtered at 0.01 Hz to eliminate orbiter rotation <ref> [45] </ref>. The resulting displacements have shown that a 10 mm motion gap is sufficient for vibration isolation. If the isolated experiment package is connected with the spacecraft by umbilicals, it is probably necessary to add an acceleration servo using accelerometers attached to the package (cf. Figure 18).

Such a system allows controlled zero-acceleration release at the aircraft velocity and at a specific location, as well as the exertion of small centering forces on the experiment platform, in effect trading acceleration levels for experiment duration. <p> Note that with fairly stringent performance limitations on the coarse motion stage performance (2 Hz bandwidth, 5 m=s 2 max. acceleration, 1 m/s max. velocity), typical gap requirements have been obtained from simulations using NASA KC-135 acceleration data <ref> [47] </ref>. These are of the order of 10 mm along the aircraft pitch axis, 30 mm along the roll axis and 40 mm along the yaw axis. These requirements are reduced drastically as the bandwidth of the tracking platform is increased. <p> Feedback control schemes using accelerometers (inertial reference) for space and aircraft applications have been proposed and simulated, while experimental feasibility studies were carried out with a PUMA robot equipped with a Lorentz levitated wrist <ref> [47] </ref> and a single-stage large motion system equipped with the same Lorentz levitated wrist and flown on the KC-135.
