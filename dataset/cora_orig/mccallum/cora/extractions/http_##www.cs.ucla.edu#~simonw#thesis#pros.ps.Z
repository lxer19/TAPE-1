Young. </author> <title> Mach: A new kernel foundation for Unix development. </title> <booktitle> In Proc. 1986 Summer USENIX Conference, </booktitle> <pages> pages 93-113, </pages> <month> July </month> <year> 1986. </year>
Reference-contexts: The system described is built upon a micro-kernel architecture. The microkernel architecture exports as much of its functionality as possible to processes in user space, in order to provide flexibility. The particular microkernel employed is Mach 3.0 <ref> [ABB + 86] </ref>. Despite this the authors claim their approach is not specific to microkernels and is also applicable to more traditional, monolithic operating systems such as Unix. It is noted that many implementations of network protocols in microkernel systems have a poorer performance than traditional implementations.

Reference-contexts: Under normal VM, when a page of a process's memory is nonresident the the OS maintains a table that maps the page to a block of the swap device, or to a block of an executable file, in the case of a fetch-on-demand executable <ref> [LMKQ89, Bac86] </ref>. Under the proposed scheme this mapping will be extended to include more general locations, such as network interfaces and other peripherals, and the application-space of other processes, including processes running on remote hosts.

Reference-contexts: It may use the host's own DMA engine, but it will initiate the transfer itself. (Note that both methods are possible with the current Myrinet <ref> [BCF + 95] </ref> host interface: it has local memory that is reachable by the host CPU, and can itself perform DMA operations from the main memory.) 4 The ATM card under consideration has its own intelligence. <p> that the proposed pass-by-reference scheme effectively converts uni-casting by the application into lower-level multicasting, since the OS should recognize when the application is sending the same data to several locations, and subsequently multicast the data by more efficient methods when data transfer is eventually required. 4.1 Multicasting in Myrinet Myrinet <ref> [BCF + 95] </ref> is a high-speed, low-latency, wormhole-routing network. It is the local-area layer of the two-level Supercomputer Supernet (SSN) [KBC + 95, LMN + 96]. The switches are crossbar interconnects. The links have a maximum length of 25 metres.

Reference-contexts: The flexibility of having such a programmable device makes it a suitable testbed for development of these proposals within the SSN project. Functionality that cannot be fully developed over the Myrinet may instead be simulated, extending the existing Myrinet simulator that has been developed <ref> [BGK + 96] </ref> (x4.1.4). 3.4 Reduction of intra-host data copying In this section we consider only the packet-transferring operations within a single host. <p> prevent 27 buffer reservation cycles by reserving one buffer for each neighbor in the multicast tree, for each multicast group that the host is a member of. 4.1.4 Simulation experiments A simulator that emulates the network at the byte level for accurate modelling of wormhole network protocols has been written <ref> [BGK + 96] </ref> in Maisie [BtL94], a C-based, parallel, discrete-event simulation language. In order to evaluate multicasting strategies for both the Myrinet and the optical backbone the two schemes previously described (Hamiltonian circuit and rooted tree) have been incorporated into the simulator.

Reference-contexts: This implementation has involved modification of the standard LANai control program (LCP) and Myrinet device driver so that the bulk of the effort in multicasting is performed within the LANai, rather than by the host CPU. 3.7.1 MessageWay proposals The MessageWay project <ref> [CL96] </ref> is aimed at creating an architecture for the concatenation of wormhole routing LANs. It allows for end-to-end source routing through wormhole gateways, which can perform cut-through packet switching between networks. This enables low-latency communication across a wormhole internet.

Reference-contexts: It is obviously undesirable to have to rewrite large parts of existing applications just to improve their data transfer rate. 2.2 Davie: The Architecture and Implementation of a High-Speed Host Interface In this paper <ref> [Dav93] </ref> the author describes the implementation of an ATM OC-12 rate (622 Mb/s) host interface. The interface is for a DECstation 5000 a desktop workstation, and this work is performed as part of the Aurora gigabit testbed [C + 92]. <p> The author's plan is to logically centralize the protocols using a protocol graph and then distribute tasks amongst various application and server processes. The hardware platform used is a DECstation 5000 with an Aurora SAR <ref> [Dav93] </ref> as the network interface. 2.4.1 Cross-domain transfer A key problem with the efficiency of data transfer in microkernel operating systems (and also traditional operating systems) is the cost of transferring data across process domains (protection boundaries). <p> Most effort at increasing the application to network throughput can be divided into two broad categories. 1) Employ faster hardware. Davie <ref> [Dav93] </ref> is an example of this approach. Unfortunately this implies replacing existing hardware. In particular, the core aspects of a host's architecture, such as bus width and timing, cannot be updated, even if faster network interface cards are installed.

Reference-contexts: Thus the potential latency is very low. Wormhole-routing networks employ hop-by-hop backpressure flow control. Unfortunately arbitrary use of such a mechanism can lead to deadlocks within the network fabric when flow-control cycles develop <ref> [DS87, PGL96] </ref>. To prevent this a restricted form of routing is employed by Myrinet which does not allow such cycles to form.

Reference-contexts: This would enable the basic premise of the proposed scheme to be demonstrated. Provision and evaluation of multicasting is a component of the SSN project, at both levels of the two-level network. Design and simulation of the various proposed multicast schemes has already been performed <ref> [GPW96a, GPW + 96b] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Network application processes will then exhibit on-demand behavior in regard to the actual transfer of data. This is somewhat similar to the `lazy evaluation' feature of functional languages <ref> [Hen87] </ref>, and should also reduce the occurrence of redundant operations. The scheme will be implemented by extension of the operating system's existing VM mechanism.

Reference-contexts: Such an address mapping scheme has been incorporated into the Myrinet device driver and this has enabled the multicast implementation to be demonstrated with existing multicast IP applications such as `wb' <ref> [Jac94] </ref> (a distributed whiteboard) and `nv' (a video conferencing system). Measurements Only limited experimentation has been possible, because of difficulties in stressing the network with IP traffic given our current hardware configuration (Sun SPARC-station 5s running at 70 MHz).

Reference-contexts: The optical backbone network employs wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) to exploit the vast bandwidth offered by the optical fiber medium. The high-speed electronic network in SSN is a commercial product (Myrinet) that uses wormhole routing <ref> [KK79, NM93] </ref> to achieve very low latency. The optical backbone network 21 also supports wormhole routing. Other important features of the electronic LAN include source routing (the worm has the complete route to the destination when it leaves the source) and backpressure flow control (on a hop-by-hop basis).

Reference-contexts: This scheme <ref> [LH89] </ref> enables a set of loosely-coupled processors on the same network to view a coherent shared virtual address space. This allows the execution of distributed programs which use the shared-memory paradigm for their communication on these processors. The actual message passing takes place transparently to the processes.

Reference-contexts: It is in this respect that the simplification of data transfer may be more useful in the longer term. 2.3 Maeda and Bershad: Protocol Service Decomposition for High-Perform ance Networking A key concept in these authors' proposal <ref> [MB93] </ref> is the separation of the application's network interface from its operating system interface. The system described is built upon a micro-kernel architecture. The microkernel architecture exports as much of its functionality as possible to processes in user space, in order to provide flexibility. <p> With the huge database of existing network software this would be a considerable task. As a subset of these schemes, some proposals only require recompilation or relinking of the application to achieve more efficient buffer-use. The proposal by Maeda and Bershad <ref> [MB93] </ref> includes such a scheme. This is clearly an improvement, since it offers the possibility of automatic upgrading of applications. As a practical point, it does however require access to source code and any libraries used.

Reference-contexts: This combining of the LAN and host internal datapaths complements the proposals of this document. It is also worth noting that for the system architecture of their latest machines, Sun Microsystems has adopted a point-to-point mesh network for the backplane (the Ultra Port Architecture <ref> [Mic96] </ref>), rather than the conventional bus architecture.

Reference-contexts: It is evident that the potential inter-host data transfer rates are comparable to or in excess of the actual intra-host data transfer rates <ref> [MS92, SP93] </ref>. This is why we should take the approach of examining the entire datapath, within and between hosts. Traditional network research has assumed that the link-speed of the network is the final decider of throughput.

In wormhole routing <ref> [NM93] </ref>, the unit of information transfer is a worm. A worm can range in length from a few bytes to several thousand bytes. In Myrinet, the maximum worm size is 9 Kbytes (this is a limit imposed by the LANai's control program).

Reference-contexts: It is interesting to note that after stating that avoidance of rewriting application code was a primary goal, the authors go on in the results section to note that they did in fact do this to increase performance. 6 2.4 Peterson: OS Support for High-Speed Networking This paper <ref> [Pet90] </ref> presents several ways in which software design, in particular of the operating system, can improve interprocess communication, both between processes running on the same host and processes running on hosts connect by a network.
