Title: Real-Time Simulation-Based Planning for Computer Generated Force Simulation  
Author: Jin Joo Lee Paul A. Fishwick 
Affiliation: Department of Computer and Information Sciences University of Florida  
Abstract: Automated Planning has been an active research topic for more than thirty years but only recently has it started to move in the direction of combining planning and execution to achieve what is sometimes called as Intelligent Reactive Planning. We propose Simulation-Based Planning (SBP) as a new way to perform intelligent reactive planning. SBP |unlike most other planning systems|integrates simulation into the planning process. Once a set of plans is generated, simulations are used to test and evaluate the plans to choose the most applicable plan for that current situation. In most planning systems, plan evaluation depends on rules alone and because rules must be designed general enough to cover all possible cases, the evaluation is not specific enough for some individual cases. However, when the plan evaluation is done through simulations, the evaluation can be more fine-tuned to individual cases and can allow better plans to be chosen for that individual case. From the military planning perspective, the simulation-based planner is also quite useful due to its ability to perform adversarial and multiagent planning. This is a natural consequence of using simulation in the planning process. By allowing other entities such as the enemy to simulate in parallel with the planner's forces, the planner is able to observe, prior to the actual execution, the effects of adversarial and multiagent actions against its own plans.

Reference-contexts: Recent approaches use some form of rule-based expert systems such as SOAR <ref> [12, 13, 1, 19] </ref>. Since thousands of rules are involved just to model one object, the complexity of maintaining and reasoning about plans is not easy since rule-based systems are usually centralized.

Reference-contexts: To decide whether to accept a course of action, one can use a constructive model (a "wargame") to evaluate the alternatives. Related work by Czigler et al. <ref> [2] </ref> demonstrates the usefulness of simulation as a decision tool. Our extension in SBP is one where we permit many levels of abstraction for a model, not just the aggregate abstraction level characterized by Lanchester equations and combat result tables.

Reference-contexts: In the current version, the enemy unit is simulated in a very limited manner. The enemy unit is assumed to remain stationary and only engage in combat when an opposing force unit has been sighted. Currently, our method employs the Aggregate Combat Model <ref> [3] </ref>. Table 1 lists and defines the variables of the model. The model takes as inputs the initial values of attacker and defender strengths, A 0 and D 0 , and values of the attrition coefficients K a and K d .

Reference-contexts: In such cases, accurate prediction of the resulting states of plan execution will be difficult. To overcome this increase in complexity of reasoning, many new approaches have been introduced <ref> [20, 4, 10, 9] </ref>. Mission planning in the military has all of these properties and more.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the simulation literature, simulation is defined as " the discipline of designing a model of an actual or theoretical physical system, executing the model on a digital computer, and analyzing the execution output"; Fishwick [8]. In the planning literature, Dean <ref> [5] </ref> states that the idea of using a model to formulate sequences of actions is central to planning and, given a sequence of actions, a robot can use the model to simulate the future as it would occur if the actions were carried out.

Reference-contexts: Second, SBP can produce plans in real time since we can allow simulation of plans at different levels of abstraction. Multimodeling <ref> [7, 6, 8, 14] </ref> will be used to model processes and agents at multiple abstraction levels. Related work [15] suggests the use of a coordinated set of methods, each method having different scope and performance. Some experimental implementations of this approach has been done on Soar [18]. <p> This method would be quite realistic, but it can be quite time consuming. In general, a complete simulation will be more time consuming than a temporal projection using rules. If computing capabilities are limited, we can perform simulation at different levels of abstraction <ref> [14, 6] </ref> where each higher level will use less computational power. Another solution is to let the enemy units follow a less sophisticated planning process allowing limited intelligence. This is the approach we are taking for this particular application.

For planners that have to work in the Computer Generated Force simulation <ref> [11] </ref> using the Distributed Interactive Simulation Environments, they have to handle these uncertainties in real time since the Computer Generated Forces have to fight against the opposing force (which are normally human trainees) in real time.
