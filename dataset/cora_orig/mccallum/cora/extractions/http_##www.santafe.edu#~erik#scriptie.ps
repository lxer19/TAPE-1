Reference-contexts: Certain mathematical procedures (which can sometimes seem rather obscure) have been constructed to obtain finite answers. These procedures are called renormalization procedures. The general idea of renormalization consists of three steps, see for instance <ref> [1] </ref>. The first step is to change the original theory in such a way that all answers become finite. This is mostly done by excluding wave modes of the fields with higher frequencies then some fixed maximum frequency, or equivalently, excluding interactions at shorter distances then some fixed minimum distance.

Reference-contexts: So, if the divergences are removed at one order by letting the parameters of the theory depend on the regulator, they will be removed to every order. By contrast, in quantum gravity the divergences become more and more virulent at every higher order, see for instance <ref> [2] </ref>. We should therefore need an infinite number of parameters to remove all these divergences. This is why quantum gravity is called non renormalizable. 1.4 1+1 dimensional conformal theory In this thesis we will be mostly concerned with a massless scalar field in 1+1 dimensions.

Reference-contexts: A large part of this thesis is concerned with the investigation of these problems. 1.5 Physical effects Finally, we will now look at some physical effects. The most famous physical effect of quantum fields in curved spacetime is of course Hawking's discovery of black hole radiation <ref> [3] </ref>. When one considers quantum fields moving in the background of a ball of matter, collapsing to a black hole we will see the following thing. In the distant past the spacetime looks like Minkowski spacetime and we can define a natural vacuum state of the quantum field. <p> see that the parameter of this conformal transformation which relates the two geometries is also the parameter which determines the temperature of the thermal radiation. 6.4 Collapsing ball We will now consider the effects on the quantum fields of a spherically symmetric collapsing ball of matter, following the treatment of <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Much of our presentation (and much more on this subject) can be found in the book <ref> [4] </ref>. First we will talk about the structure of spacetime itself and the way in which we will let it interact with the quantum fields. <p> Other field theories can be quantized in an analogous way but may involve more subtleties in the definition of the quantization, again see <ref> [4] </ref>. Furthermore, a massless scalar field in 1+1 dimensions is the most simple example of a quantum field in curved spacetime which includes all the different features that are special to quantum fields in curved spacetime. <p> Lines of constant u at late times all got reflected from lines just below v = B. we will further assume that the detector is only switched on (in some smooth manner which doesn't disturb the fields) for late times. After some algebra, performing the integrations (see <ref> [4] </ref>) we find for the detector response function per unit time: F (E) = E (e k B T 1) with: k B T = 2 So we see that the detector responds to a constant flux of particles from the mirror which have a thermal spectrum with a temperature that

Reference-contexts: Details concerning curved spacetimes and general relativity can be found in any book on general relativity, for instance <ref> [5] </ref>. Generally, spacetime is some n dimensional manifold, which is covered by one or more coordinate patches. So for any point p on the manifold there is a mapping to the coordinates: p ! x (p); (2.1) where runs from 0 to n 1 for a n dimensional manifold.

Reference-contexts: So the a k become operators and we define particle states in this curved spacetime by eigenvectors of the number operators N k associated with these operators. But now this procedure has become ambiguous <ref> [7] </ref>. Remember how we constructed these modes and particle states in flat spacetime. That procedure was mainly inspired by using the natural set of coordinates on flat spacetime.

Reference-contexts: change for non-inertial observers? To get more insight into the connection between the particle content of a stat and the specific observer evaluating that state we will now define particles in terms of a particle detector model and the trajectory which is followed by an observer who carries the detector <ref> [9] </ref>. We will take the spacetime to be the flat Minkowski spacetime with the natural vacuum. Already in this case we will see that particle detectors of different observers will react differently to the vacuum.

Reference-contexts: This indicates that the reaction of the accelerating detector to a Minkowski vacuum state is exactly the same as the reaction of a detector at rest to a thermal bath of radiation at a temperature given by: k B T = 2ff see <ref> [10] </ref> So we see that by defining particles as an observer dependent notion, determined by probability of excitement of a detector moving along the trajectory of the observer, different observers indeed see a different particle content of the same quantum state.

Reference-contexts: classically this function is useless, but we will see that in quantum field theory this function describes the propagation of free fields and so is of central importance there. 3.1 Two point functions Now by using the Fourier mode expansion of the fields, it can be shown (see for instance <ref> [11] </ref>), that the Feynman Green function is related to the time ordered vacuum expectation values of the fields in the following way: iG F (x; x 0 ) =&lt; 0jT ((x)(x 0 ))j0 &gt; : (3.8) Where the function T means time ordering, or: iG F (x; x 0 ) =

In that case we also have an analytic function on the whole complex plane. We'll call this function G (t; ~x).

Our treatment here will closely follow the treatment in <ref> [17] </ref>. We know that every holomorphic coordinate transformation on the complex plane generates a conformal transformation. So what we need to do is construct a renormalization procedure which leaves the renormalized stress tensor transforming holomorphic.

The procedure which we will use here can be found in <ref> [19] </ref>. We will again use a point-splitting procedure, now in a generally curved space-time and we will take the metric into account by moving the field operators from each other along a geodesic. <p> We will define a regularized stress tensor by moving just one point from its position z 0 ; z 0 to z (t ); z (t ). This asymmetry doesn't affect the outcome of the calculation when the limit is taken t ! 0, see <ref> [19] </ref>. We will first look at the T zz component of the stress tensor.

Then we will analyze how uniformly accelerating observers see the vacuum. These are the so called Rindler observers,see <ref> [21] </ref>. Thereafter we will take a look at the vacuum in a spacetime to the right of a mirror that is accelerating to the left.

Reference-contexts: There is however a physical situation which is quite similar to the one above where an effect occurs very much like the effect above. This is the so called Casimir effect <ref> [22] </ref>. Casimir showed that the vacuum of the electromagnetic field between two large conducting plates also contains a uniform negative energy density. He found: &lt; 0jT tt j0 &gt;/ L 4 ; (6.11) where L is the distance between the two plates.

Reference-contexts: Now the negative energy between the plates implies that there is a force of attraction between these plates. This force has indeed been experimentally detected <ref> [23] </ref>, which shows that effects of this sort can indeed be very physical.

Reference-contexts: Now if the ball of matter is sufficiently dense it will collapse completely to a singularity and form a black hole, see for instance <ref> [27] </ref>. We will assume that in the distant past the ball is so large and distended that we can we neglect the curvature of spacetime and approximate it with the flat Minkowski spacetime. Therefore the natural vacuum in the distant past is just the Minkowski vacuum state.

The zeroth law: T = constant (6.91) that the temperature of a body in thermodynamical equilibrium is constant over the body finds its analogy in = constant (6.92) the fact that the surface gravity of a black hole is constant over the surface of any black hole.

Reference-contexts: It has been suggested that the entropy of the black hole could be related to the fact that observers outside the horizon have no knowledge of the state of the quantum fields inside the horizons <ref> [32] </ref>. Different microscopic states of the black hole would then correspond to different field states inside the horizon.

Reference-contexts: In this chapter we will try to define such a concept in the context of quantum field theory. 7.1 Thermodynamical entropy In statistical physics, one defines a notion of entropy in the following way, see for instance <ref> [33] </ref>. First one makes a distinction between the microscopic and macroscopic state of a system. Every state of the system corresponds to one microscopic state. Every macroscopic state generally corresponds to a very large number of microscopic states.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, this radiation will try to slow down the detector, so the agency that is accelerating the observer has to supply the extra energy to keep the detector accelerating uniformly. For more details on `what happens if a accelerating observer detects a particle' see <ref> [43] </ref>. Another interesting feature of the above analysis is that the observer sees a thermal bath of particles. Now a thermal state is not a pure state, but a mix of different quantum states with different probabilities.
