Title: Natural Language Processing Using a Propositional Semantic Network with Structured Variables

Abstract: We describe a knowledge representation and inference formalism, based on an intensional propositional semantic network, in which variables are structured terms consisting of quantifier, type, and other information. This has three important consequences for natural language processing. First, this leads to an extended, more "natural" formalism whose use and representations are consistent with the use of variables in natural language in two ways: the structure of representations mirrors the structure of the language and allows re-use phenomena such as pronouns and ellipsis. Second, the formalism allows the specification of description subsumption as a partial ordering on related concepts (variable nodes in a semantic network) that relates more general concepts to more specific instances of that concept, as is done in language. Finally, this structured variable representation simplifies the resolution of some representational difficulties with certain classes of natural language sentences, namely, donkey sentences and sentences involving branching quantifiers. The implementation of this formalism is called ANALOG (A NAtural Logic) and its utility for natural language processing tasks is illustrated.

Reference-contexts: We note that the semantics of structured variables is left largely unspecified here, due to space limitations. However, it is an augmented (by the addition of arbitrary individuals) semantic theory based on [ 15, 16, 17, 41 ] and described in <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> . <p> We will provide semantics for nodes, in this paper, as necessary. For a complete specification of the semantics of ANALOG, see <ref> [ 1, 2 ] </ref> . 5.1.2 The Domain of Interpretation ANALOG nodes are terms of a formal language. The interpretation of a node is an object in the domain of interpretation, called an entity. <p> Such a variable will subsume another node if and only if every restriction on the variable can be derived (in the current model) for the node being subsumed. Subsumption, consequently, requires derivation which is defined in <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> . For the examples shown here, standard first-order logical derivation will be assumed. Case (4) allows a more general universal variable node to subsume a less general existential variable node.

Reference-contexts: Partitioned semantic networks [ 22, 23 ] or a representation for collections [ 11 ] would allow the representation of all possible quantifier scopings. 3.3.1 Branching Quantifiers There is a class of natural language sentences that are not expressible in any linear notation <ref> [ 3, 14, 33, 34 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: Further, it suffers from the same (previously described) problems that all logic-based variable representations do. A related body of work is that of Barwise and Cooper <ref> [ 4 ] </ref> on generalized quantifiers in natural language.

Reference-contexts: Finally, collections of logical formulas do not seem to capture the intuitive use of concepts by people. This representation for knowledge is unstructured and disorganized. What is missing is that first-order predicate logic does not provide any special assistance in the problem of what Brachman called "knowledge structuring" <ref> [ 6 ] </ref> , that is, the specification of the internal structure of concepts in terms of roles and interrelations between them and the inheritance relationships between concepts. Any computational theory must incorporate knowledge-structuring mechanisms, such as subsumption and inheritance of the sort supported in frame-based and semantic-network-based systems.

Reference-contexts: Further, we provide a subsumption mechanism not typically present in logical form work. Previous work using atomic (that is, unstructured) variable representation has been primarily based on FOPL. In the work of Schubert et al. <ref> [ 35, 10 ] </ref> , which uses a semantic-network-based formalism, variables are atomic nodes in the network. Type (and other) restrictions are specified by links to the variable nodes. There are no explicit universal or existential quantifiers. Free variables are implicitly universally quantified; Skolem arcs specify existentially quantified variable nodes.

Reference-contexts: Variables are still scoped (by the DRS) and not conceptually complete, although all their constraints are associated with the DRS in whose scope they lie. An important philosophically motivated attempt to represent the semantics of natural language is Montague grammar <ref> [ 12, 31, 32 ] </ref> . Montague grammar is a theory of natural language processing in that it is a complete formal specification of the syntax, semantics, and knowledge representation for natural language understanding.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, since restrictions on possible fillers for variables appear to be simple type restrictions, there is no representation for noun phrases with restrictive relative clause complements and, consequently, no representation for donkey sentences. Fahlman's <ref> [ 13 ] </ref> representation of variables is more general (potentially variables have complex structure) but has similar shortcomings. An alternative atomic variable representation theory is that of Discourse Representation Theory [ 26 ] .

Reference-contexts: In some of them it had just been installed. Every chess set comes with a spare pawn. It is taped to the top of the box. (examples from <ref> [ 21 ] </ref> ). The structures that are being shared in these sentences are the variables corresponding to the italicized noun phrases. Logical representations can only model this "sharing" by combining multiple sentences of natural language into one sentence of logic. This method is unnatural for at least two reasons.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, constituents of complex terms (concepts) in the TBox are not available in the ABox, so donkey sentences cannot be represented.

Ontic is a system for verifying mathematical arguments, and, as such, the selection of type expressions and functions is limited to the mathematical domain.

Reference-contexts: Figure 3 shows the fragment of the generalized augmented transition network (GATN) grammar that processes noun phrases corresponding to structured variables <ref> [ 37 ] </ref> . Note that in this NP subnetwork all restrictions on a noun phrase corresponding to a structured variable can be locally collected and the corresponding structured variable built. <p> At this junction, we will attempt to illustrate the utility of the system in the context of specific examples of natural language processing. ANALOG includes a generalized augmented transition network (GATN) natural language parser and generation component linked up to the knowledge base (based on <ref> [ 37 ] </ref> ). A GATN grammar specifies the translation/generation of sentences involving complex noun phrases into/from ANALOG structured variable representations. We present three demonstrations of the NLP component of ANALOG.

Typically, the most acceptable interpretation of the former sentence requires that it not be interpreted as the latter.

Reference-contexts: The general motivation for a logical form is the need for a mediating representation between syntactic and meaning representations, usually in the context of determin 9 ing quantifier scoping. Representative examples of logical-form-based approaches include <ref> [ 25, 27, 43 ] </ref> . Logical form representations resemble this work in that, typically, quantifiers are bundled with typed variables that are "complete" in the manner described here.

This is a form of structural subsumption <ref> [ 44 ] </ref> , peculiar to semantic network formalisms,s which allows a proposition to "reduce" to (logically imply) propositions whose wires are a subset of the wires of the original proposition. Figure 7 gives an example of a proposition expressing a brotherhood relation among a group of men. <p> In ANALOG, we specify subsumption as a binary relation between arbitrary nodes in the network. We define subsumption between two nodes x and y in Figure 8. This definition of subsump-tion includes subsumption mechanisms that Woods classifies as structural, recorded, axiomatic, and deduced subsumption <ref> [ 44 ] </ref> . In Figure 8, case (1) corresponds to identical nodes (a node, obviously, subsumes itself). Case (2) is the reduction inference case discussed in section 5.1.6.

Reference-contexts: There is a large body of work in structured object representation that characterizes very complex structured variables as frames, scripts, and so on. Frame-based systems such as KL-ONE and KRL use highly structured concept representations to express the "meaning" of concepts <ref> [ 5, 9, 45 ] </ref> . These concept representations are constructed using structural primitives.
