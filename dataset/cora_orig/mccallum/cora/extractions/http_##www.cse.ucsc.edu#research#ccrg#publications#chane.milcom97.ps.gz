Abstract: Today's internetwork technology has been extremely successful in linking huge numbers of computers and users. However, to date, this technology has been oriented to computer interconnection in relatively stable operational environments, and thus cannot adequately support many of the emerging civilian and military uses that require a more adaptive and more easily deployed technology. In particular, multihop packet radio networks are ideal for establishing instant communication infrastructures in disaster areas resulting from flood, earthquake, hurricane, or fires, supporting U.S. military doctrine for reliable, secure infrastructures for communication among all tiers down to the soldiers on-the-move, and extending the global communication infrastructure to the wireless, mobile environment. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is sponsoring the development of wireless internet gateways (WINGs) as part of the DARPA Global Mobile (GloMo) Information Systems program. WINGs are wireless IP routers that enable the seamless marriage of distributed, dynamic, self-organizing, multihop wireless networks with the emerging multimedia Internet. This paper describes the WING architecture and novel communication protocols for channel access and routing, as well as the hardware and software development environment used to prototype and demonstrate wireless mobile internetworking.

Reference-contexts: The simulation results obtained using the parameters of the Utilicom radio also show the importance of carrier sensing; because the Utilicom radio does not provide true carrier sensing, the performance of FAMA-NCS degrades substantially, as predicted by the theory <ref> [6] </ref>, [7]. We have also shown that WIRP provides internet routing in the ad-hoc network environment and converges efficiently, even when competing with heavy traffic for bandwidth to send it's routing-table update information.

The simulation results presented assumed single-path routing, in which the protocol provided a single path to each destination.
