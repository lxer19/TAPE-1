Abstract: Domains such as multiple trauma management, in which there are multiple interacting goals that change over time, are ones in which plan recognition's standard inductive bias towards a single explanatory goal is inappropriate. In this paper we define and argue for an alternative bias based on identifying contextually "relevant" goals. We support this claim by showing how a complementary planning system in TraumAID 2.0, a decision-support system for the management of multiple trauma, allows us to define a four-level scale of relevance and therefore, of measurable deviations from relevance. This in turn allows definition of a bias towards relevance in the incremental recognition of physician plans by Traum-AID's critiquing interface, TraumaTIQ.

Reference-contexts: TraumaTIQ then evaluates that plan and compares it to TraumAID's plan in order to determine potential errors to comment on in the critique. The plan evaluation and critique generation components will not be described in this paper. They are discussed in detail in <ref> (Gertner 1995) </ref>. In the next section, we introduce TraumAID 2.0 and describe the representation of planning knowledge and the process by which it generates plans.

Reference-contexts: Since there are theoretically many possible explanations for any set or sequence of observations, plan recognition requires an inductive bias. Previous plan recognition algorithms, most notably <ref> (Kautz 1990) </ref>, incorporated a bias towards minimizing the number of goals used to explain the observed actions. Such a bias is inappropriate in a domain such as multiple trauma management where, as discussed in the preceding section, a range of independent diagnostic and therapeutic goals may be active simultaneously.

Reference-contexts: Another feature of TraumAID's goal posting and planning is that its reasoner embeds a conservative, staged strategy for selecting diagnosis and treatment goals <ref> (Rymon 1993) </ref>: goals whose satisfaction requires expensive and/or risky procedures are not included in a plan until they are justified by less costly tests or observations.

Reference-contexts: The process of inferring these mental states is generally referred to as plan recognition. The importance of plan recognition for automated decision support has been recognized by both ourselves and Shahar and Musen <ref> (Shahar & Musen 1995) </ref>. In connection with automated decision support, plan recognition can support several elements of critiquing, including flexible plan evaluation, explanation of critiques, and proposing alternative actions and goals.
