Abstract: The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is considering the adoption of the controlled-load service, a real-time service with very relaxed service guarantees [Wro95]. Measurement-based admission control algorithms (MBAC's), as opposed to the more conservative worst-case parameter-based methods, were expressly designed to achieve high levels of network utilization for such relaxed real-time services. Most researchers studying MBAC's, including ourselves [JDSZ97], have focused primarily on the design of the admission control equations using a variety of principled and ad hoc motivations. In this paper we show that, much to our own surprise, the admission control equations developed so far in the MBAC literature give essentially the same performance. Furthermore, we observe that the equations, even though they are derived and motivated in quite different ways, have the same structural form.

We do not consider Eqn. 10 in this study because it requires measurement of per-source average rate, which we do not believe can be accurately and cost effectively measured.

Reference-contexts: Another direction MBAC research should take is to solve the structural problems that arise from interactions between reservations that we first pointed out in <ref> [JDSZ95] </ref> and describe again in Section 7.2 below. 7.1 Tuning the Parameters There are two items to this research agenda: First, tuning the parameters of an MBAC can either move one along the loss-load frontier or away from it. <p> S is in packet transmission time unit. S w * values 5e3 3 0.35, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999 6.5e3 4 0.8, 0.9, 0.9417, 0.999, 0.9999 Extending our work in <ref> [JDSZ95] </ref>, the authors of [CKT96] suggest a feedback control mechanism to automatically tune the measurement parameters based on observed loss rate. The appropriate time scale over which these and parameters in the f () and g () functions are tuned is still a matter of future research.
