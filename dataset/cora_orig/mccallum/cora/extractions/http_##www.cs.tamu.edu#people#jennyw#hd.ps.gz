Title: A Mutual Exclusion Algorithm for Ad Hoc Mobile Networks  
Author: Jennifer Walter Jennifer L. Welch Nitin Vaidya 
Address: College Station, TX 77843-3112  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science Texas A&M University  
Abstract: A fault-tolerant distributed mutual exclusion algorithm which adjusts to node mobility is presented, along with proof of correctness and preliminary simulation results. The algorithm requires nodes to communicate with only their current neighbors, making it well-suited to the ad hoc environment.

Reference-contexts: Dynamic networks are fixed wired networks which share some characteristics of ad hoc networks, since failure and repair of nodes and links is unpredictable in both cases. Research on dynamic networks has focused on total ordering [13], end-to-end communication, and routing (e.g., <ref> [1, 2] </ref>). Existing distributed algorithms will run correctly on top of ad hoc routing protocols, since these protocols are designed to hide the dynamic nature of the network topology from higher layers in the protocol stack (see figure 1 (a)).

Reference-contexts: Allowing request messages to be sent over all edges of the DAG provides resilience to link and site failures. However, this algorithm does not consider link recovery, an essential feature in a system of mobile nodes. Dhamdhere and Kulkarni [7] show that the algorithm of <ref> [4] </ref> can suffer from deadlock and solve this problem by assigning a dynamically changing sequence number to each node, forming a total ordering of nodes in the system. <p> The partial reversal technique from [10], used to maintain a destination oriented DAG in a packet radio network when the destination is static, is used in our algorithm to maintain a token oriented DAG with a dynamic destination. Like the algorithms of [19], <ref> [4] </ref>, and [7], each node in our algorithm maintains a request queue containing the identifiers of neighboring nodes from which it has received requests for the token. Like [7], our algorithm totally orders nodes. <p> The performance of our simulation under heavy demand is similar to the results obtained through simulation by [19] and <ref> [4] </ref> for more static situations. In figure 4 (b), the average wait time per CS entry, on the y axis, is plotted against the same request arrival and mobility rates as were used in figure 4 (a).

Node i raises its height (in lines 1-3) using the partial reversal method of <ref> [10] </ref> and informs all its neighbors of its height change with LinkInfo messages. All nodes on Q to which links are now outgoing are deleted from Q. <p> To prove that the DAG is eventually token oriented, we first show, in Lemma 1, that this condition is equivalent to the absence of "sink" nodes <ref> [10] </ref>, as defined below. We then show, in Lemma 3, that eventually there are no sinks, if link failures cease. Definition 3 A node i is a sink in a state if (tokenHolder i = false) and ((myHeight i &lt; height i [j]), for all j 2 N i ).
