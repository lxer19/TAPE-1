Abstract: One missing link between CAD and CAM is the lack of a systematic methodology for generating and evaluating alternative ways to manufacture a proposed design. To address this problem, we are developing a systematic approach for generating and evaluating alternative ways to manufacture machined parts, in order to provide information to the designer about the manufacturability of the proposed design, and information to the process engineer about how best to machine the part. This paper describes our overall approach, and how MRSEVs (Material Removal Shape Element Volumes, a STEP library of machining features) can be used to support it.

Reference-contexts: Recognizing Machining Features To obtain machining features from a CAD model, there are three primary approaches. In human-supervised feature recognition, a human user examines an existing CAD model to determine what the manufacturing features are <ref> [2] </ref>. In automatic feature recognition, the same feature recognition task is performed by a computer system [5, 29, 25, 6, 13]. In design by features, the designer specifies the initial CAD model in terms of various form features which translate directly into the relevant manufacturing features [26, 28, 12].

Reference-contexts: For example, if it decides that some hole needs to be made before some slot, it does not automatically update the dimensions of the hole or the slot| information which would be needed for process selection. The AMPS process planning system <ref> [3] </ref> includes a "feature refinement" step, in which heuristic techniques are used to combine a set of features into a more complex feature, or split a feature into two or more features. Since the techniques are heuristic in nature, it is not entirely clear when alternative interpretations will be produced.

Reference-contexts: Once R's time-order graph has been computed, the set of all machining orders for R is identical to the set of all total orderings consistent with the time-order graph. These machining orders can easily be computed from the time-order graph, using topological sorting techniques <ref> [17, 4] </ref>. ESTIMATING ACHIEVABLE TOLERANCE Each machining operation creates a feature which has certain geometric variations compared to its nominal geometry. Designers normally give tolerance specifications on the nominal geometry, to specify how large these variations are allowed to be.

Reference-contexts: Below, we briefly describe several operators for producing equivalent MRSEVs (for more detailed descriptions, see <ref> [8] </ref>). In each case, r is a removal volume in R. enlarge (r). Try to find a MRSEV instance r 0 that subsumes r, by extending r into some adjacent removal volume q 2 R. <p> By starting with a given MRSEV model R and applying the operators described above, it is possible to produce other MRSEV models equivalent to R. In <ref> [8] </ref>, we describe a state-space search algorithm that will generate all MRSEV models that can be produced in this manner. <p> In this case, the precedence constraints define a partial ordering on the removal volumes in R. We represent this partial ordering using a graph structure called a time-order graph (which is essentially identical to a Hasse diagram [23]). Fig. 9 shows an example part and its time-order graph. In <ref> [8] </ref>, we present an algorithm called create-time 7 sectioned view (b) FBM 1 (a) PART isometric view order-graph. This algorithm identifies R's precedence constraints by examining the removal volumes of R and their accessibility volumes, and then it uses these precedence constraints to construct R's time-order graph. <p> In <ref> [8] </ref> we describe how to augment the reinterpretation operators to accomplish this. We can improve the efficiency even further by noting that it is not necessary to examine every one of the MRSEV models for P and S in order to find the best ones.

Reference-contexts: Instead, we can use heuristic techniques to discard unpromising MR-SEV models, and examine only the promising ones. The basic idea consists of the following loop <ref> [9] </ref>: 1. Use reinterpretation operators to generate a new MR SEV model R of P and S. 2. Map each of R's removal volumes to the machining operation (s) capable of creating it. Augment R to include the accessibility volumes corresponding to these machining operations.

Reference-contexts: Generating Alternatives Hummel [11] and Mantyla [21] present examples of multiple feature representations of the same object. However, these papers do not describe a system or methodology for generating multiple feature models. Hayes's machinist system <ref> [10] </ref> can identify certain cases in which one feature needs to be made before another. However, its representation of features is not adequate for all aspects of process planning. <p> PRECEDENCE CONSTRAINTS The removal volumes in a MRSEV model cannot necessarily be machined in any arbitrary order. Instead, accessibility [22], setup <ref> [10] </ref> and other types of interactions among them will introduce precedence constraints requiring that some of them be machined before or after others. Let R be a MRSEV model, and let q and r be any two removal volumes in R.

Reference-contexts: Machinability Evaluation Because of the need for quality assurance on the shop floor, extensive research has been done on evaluating of machinability for a given design. Much of the data relevant for machining operation planning is available in machining data handbooks such as <ref> [20] </ref>. In addition, mechanistic models have been developed to provide quantitative mappings between machining parameters (such as cutting speed, feed, and depth of cut), to the performance measures of interest (such as surface finish and dimensional accuracy) [31]. <p> Our models take into account the following factors: 1. The machining system parameters, such as the feed rate, cutting speed, depth of cut, and structural dy namics <ref> [20, 22] </ref>. 2. The natural and external variations in the machining process. For example, variations in hardness in the material being machined cause random vibration, which is one of the major factors affecting the surface quality [31, 32, 22].

DEFINITIONS Basic Concepts A solid is any regular, semi-analytic subset of three-dimensional Euclidean space. <p> The methodology for estimating the fixed and variable costs of machining operations is well understood; formulas for estimating these costs can be found in standard handbooks. The particular formulas we use are presented in <ref> [30, 22] </ref>. IMPROVING COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY Given a MRSEV model R, we will want not only to generate other interpretations equivalent to R, but also to generate their time-order graphs.

Reference-contexts: In addition, mechanistic models have been developed to provide quantitative mappings between machining parameters (such as cutting speed, feed, and depth of cut), to the performance measures of interest (such as surface finish and dimensional accuracy) <ref> [31] </ref>. Research on machining economics has produced quantitative models for evaluating costs related to machining operations [1, 30]. Optimization techniques have been applied to these quantitative models to seek the machining parameters which minimize the variable cost, or maximize the production rate and profit rate associated with machining operations. <p> The natural and external variations in the machining process. For example, variations in hardness in the material being machined cause random vibration, which is one of the major factors affecting the surface quality <ref> [31, 32, 22] </ref>. To model these factors, we use a combination of determin istic, statistical, and empirical techniques [31, 32, 22]. Machining processes that do not involve single-point cut 8 ting tools are complex enough that we have not yet suc-ceeded in constructing accurate mathematical models of them. <p> For example, variations in hardness in the material being machined cause random vibration, which is one of the major factors affecting the surface quality <ref> [31, 32, 22] </ref>.
