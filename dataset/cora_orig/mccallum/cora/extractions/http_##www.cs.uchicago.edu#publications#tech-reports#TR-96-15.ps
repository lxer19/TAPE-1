Title: Layer Formation in Monodispersive Suspensions  
Author: and Colloids A. E. Hosoi Todd F. Dupont 
Date: July 16, 1996  
Abstract: We present theoretical results on spontaneous stratification of sedi-menting suspensions and colloids caused by a lateral temperature gradient. Fluid motion is treated in the Stokes approximation, and motion of suspended particles is described by Burgers equation with convection. The internal structure and interaction of shocks at convection roll boundaries is studied numerically using a reduced 1D model based on a Galerkin approach. Qualitative comparison is made to experimental data.

It is sufficient for our purposes to use the Burgers equation description <ref> [1, 15, 6] </ref> with advection. We assume that the drift of particles is due to fluid convection and buoyancy hindered by particle interaction. The latter is described in the dilute limit by Batchelor's formula [2]. <p> It has traveling wave solutions which describe the motion of the interface between the colloid and the supernatant (medium free from particles) <ref> [1, 15, 6] </ref>. Surprisingly, the Burgers form is not required to produce the steep concentration gradients between layers. Numerical evidence shows that steps in concentration form even when v 0 = 0.

Regularizing forces such as surface charge may also lead to different values of k. The numerical results presented here were run with k between 2 and 7.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction For over a century, it has been observed that an initially uniform suspension will develop multiple layers of varying concentrations <ref> [3, 10] </ref>. This phenomenon is of potential interest for industrial applications and possibly geological processes as well [13]. <p> This phenomenon has been documented in a wide range of materials and in both sedimenting and creaming particles <ref> [3, 13, 11] </ref>. More recently, it has been shown [11] that there is a convection cell in each layer apparently driven by a small horizontal temperature gradient ~ 0:01 ffi C (see Fig. 1).

Reference-contexts: The c equation has been written out since it has different nonlinear terms from the Galerkin c equation. Another approach is the control volume method <ref> [7] </ref>. Here we start with (19) and (20) however, instead of evaluating the function at specific points, we integrate over x.

Reference-contexts: We substitute the velocity ansatz (9), (10) in (3) and integrate over the domain: - r 2 u ~dr = 1 2d Z Here r = (x; y) and pressure has been eliminated by integrating by parts <ref> [8] </ref>. Before we can perform the integration, we need to choose a trial function for the concentration.

Reference-contexts: We are dealing with small Reynolds numbers and time scales greatly exceeding settling of viscous flows, which allows us to use Stokes approximation <ref> [9] </ref>. Then the equations of motion for an incompressible fluid in the presence of gravity g, become rp = (-u + g); (1) We neglect the viscosity dependence on particle volume fraction, c, and temperature. However, in the forcing term we need to retain the c and T dependence.

We find that each "shock" is the line separating two adjacent convection rolls; this is a detailed description of the scenario suggested in <ref> [10] </ref>. Multiple rolls and strata in a monodispersive system can be induced by special initial conditions with stretched gradients of particle concentration. We begin by analyzing thermal convection in the presence of a lateral temperature gradient. <p> If gets too large, ~ O (1), the layer will be destroyed. Thus T max ~ 2 fi . As suggested by <ref> [10] </ref> "both a temperature and a density gradient are necessary to produce stratification." We can estimate the initial size of the convection rolls by balancing these two effects.

The tilted initial condition was motivated by experiments done by Siano <ref> [13] </ref> in which linearly varying the initial concentration lead to much more rapid formation of multiple shocks. An example of this initial concentration is shown in Fig. 3 as a dotted line. We found that there is a limited range of initial slopes in which multiple shocks are formed. <p> Both multiple shocks and multiple convection rolls are observed numerically using experimental parameters (see Fig. 3). Siano <ref> [13] </ref> shows that an initial concentration gradient will give rise to evenly spaced shocks which form relatively quickly (~hours); these shocks move at approximately the creaming velocity and slowly spread apart.

Reference-contexts: Since we have restricted the form of the approximate solutions we cannot expect to satisfy the differential equations exactly, but we require that the amount by which the equations fail to hold, the residual, be constrained to be orthogonal to the trial functions <ref> [14] </ref>. In other words, multiply equations (3) and (5) in the previous section by appropriate trial functions and integrate over the entire domain and equate 7 the two sides. The resulting relations can be viewed as differential equations involving only one spatial variable, y.
