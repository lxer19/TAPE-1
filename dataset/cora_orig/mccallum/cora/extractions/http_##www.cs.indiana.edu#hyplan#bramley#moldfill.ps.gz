Abstract: This work presents industrial mold-filling applications of a three-dimensional stabilized finite element solver on distributed memory parallel architectures. The paper focusses on the solution algorithm and parallel implementation for complex mul-tiphysics problems involving high Reynolds number flows with free surfaces, turbulence modeling and heat transfer. Standard domain decomposition methods (Chaco, Metis) are applied to the graph of nodes obtained from the finite element mesh, and a distributed-memory MPI programming model is used. An implicit time integration scheme and a segregated iterative algorithm are used to solve the momentum, energy, turbulence variables and front tracking equations. The equations are dis-cretized using a stabilized SUPG finite element method on linear elements. The resulting sparse system of linear equations is solved using parallel preconditioned iterative methods.

Reference-contexts: GOVERNING EQUATIONS AND FORMULATION The solution method solves the Navier-Stokes, turbulence and energy equations on the cavity, which at a given time is partly filled with fluid and partly filled with air <ref> [Bourg et al., 1992] </ref>. On each time step these equations are solved only on elements which contain fluid or which can contain fluid on the next time step, as determined by using the maximum flow velocity on the interface between fluid and air.

Reference-contexts: For the linear elements used here SUPG and GLS are identical. The SUPG variational formulation of the momentum-continuity equations <ref> [Franca and Frey, 1992] </ref> is: Z (ae @t Z 2 fl (u) : fl (v)dW Z pr vdW + W r uqdW + K W K @u + aeu ru + rp r [2 fl (u)] aegg o u faeu rv + rqgdW K + K W K r uffir vdW <p> For linear elements the coefficient m k is set to 1=3 <ref> [Franca and Frey, 1992] </ref>. The remaining scalar transport equations (energy, turbulence and front tracking equations) are solved with the same SUPG method.

Reference-contexts: Standard mesh partitioning goals are load balancing (roughly equal amounts of work assigned to each processor) and minimal inter-processor communications (minimizing the edges in the computational graph that get cut by partition lines). The partitioning problem is relatively straightforward for a single scalar equation, and packages <ref> [Hendrickson and Leland, 1993] </ref> are available for this. However, industrial mold-filling problems are highly heterogenous. The mold and the cavity to be filled are tightly coupled in the computations by thermal effects but the mold does not require fluid modeling and so has fewer unknowns at each node.

Reference-contexts: Partitioning elements in the mesh instead of nodes is less practical, since typically there are five times as many elements as nodes. The approach used here is to apply the automatic graph partitioning tool METIS <ref> [Karypis and Kumar, 1995] </ref> separately for each system of equations. For coupled unknowns such as u and p, all of the unknowns associated with a given node are mapped to a single processor.

Reference-contexts: For laminar flows the effective viscosity eff is equal to the fluid viscosity. When flow is turbulent the effective viscosity incorporates also the turbulent viscosity T which here is computed using the k * model of turbulence <ref> [Launder and Spalding, 1972] </ref>: eff = + T k 2 (5) The same observations applie to the effective conductivity which takes on the fluid conductivity for laminar flows and on eff = + T for turbulent flow respectively. <p> So in practice air is replaced by a 'pseudo-fluid' with the above properties. 2.2. The k * model equations For this model the turbulence quantities are the turbulence kinetic energy k and its dissipation rate * which are governed by the following transport equations <ref> [Launder and Spalding, 1972] </ref>: ae ( @t T )rk] + T P (u) ae* (9) @* + u r*) = r [( + oe * * T P (u) C *2 ae k where the production of turbulence is defined as P (u) = ru : (ru + ru T ) <p> = 1:0 ; oe * = 1:3 ; C *1 = 1:44 ; C *2 = 1:92 ; C = 0:09 (12) On the boundary a combination of Neumann and Dirich--let conditions are imposed using wall functions which describe the asympotic behavior of the different variables near a solid wall <ref> [Launder and Spalding, 1972] </ref>. The normal derivative of the TKE is set to zero near the wall and the TKE values at boundary points k w are computed implicitely.

Reference-contexts: Linear System Solves The linear systems Ax = b in steps IV.A and IV.B are generated directly in a compressed sparse row format <ref> [Saad, 1996] </ref>, and solved using the biconjugate gradient stabilized (Bi-CGSTAB) algorithm [der Vorst, 1992]. The global matrix and corresponding iteration vectors are partitioned by block rows, and a block diagonal preconditioner is used. For this each processor first computes an incomplete LU factorization of the diagonal block of its row.

Reference-contexts: This can be expressed as q gap = h gap (T cavity T mold ) on G cavity (18) The finite element implementation of this is done with the coin cident node technique of Samonds <ref> [Samonds et al., 1985] </ref>. Furthermore since the turbulent heat transfer is computed using wall functions, h gap also takes into account the temperature variation given by the law of the wall. 2.4.
