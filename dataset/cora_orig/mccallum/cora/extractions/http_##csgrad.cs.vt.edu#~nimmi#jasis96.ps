Abstract: The majority of information retrieval experiments are evaluated by measures such as average precision and average recall. Fundamental decisions about the superiority of one retrieval technique over another are made solely on the basis of these measures. We claim that average performance figures need to be validated with a careful statistical analysis and that there is a great deal of additional information that can be uncovered by looking closely at the results of individual queries. This paper is a case study of stemming algorithms which describes a number of novel approaches to evaluation and demonstrates their value.

Reference-contexts: Let us presume that the variance is constant and equal to the error variance obtained from the ANOVA model, which we will denote as 2 . It is well known in statistics <ref> (Box, Hunter & Hunter 1978) </ref> that: (n 1)s 2 n1 where s 2 is the variance of a sample of size n 1 drawn from a normal population with variance 2 .

Reference-contexts: There is certainly an element of subjectivity in this approach, but the queries were constructed without regard to the specific properties of stemming algorithms. 5 The retrieval system and stemming experiments We used the SMART 2 text retrieval system developed at Cornell University <ref> (Buckley 1985) </ref> for the information retrieval experiments. We found its high indexing speed (500MB/hr on a Sparc 20) to be extremely valuable for the repeated indexing of the collection that is necessary in stemming experiments.

Reference-contexts: Average recall is a meaningless statistic at these small document levels, since it will have no power to differentiate between methods when the queries have hundreds of relevant documents. It is clear from the results presented at the TREC-2 conference <ref> (Harman 1993) </ref> that researchers using the TREC corpus recognize these problems. While talking about cognitive load, we should also mention that the presentation of results to four significant digits makes the table a lot more difficult to read.

Reference-contexts: The reader should keep in mind that the statistical tests described here have been chosen for this particular experiment. In general, the optimal test may depend on the number of experimental methods being compared. For instance, both Friedman and ANOVA have different forms when there are only two methods <ref> (Hull 1993) </ref>, and Conover (1980) suggests that there is a more powerful alternative to the Friedman Test for cases when three or four methods are being compared. 9 Identifying Important Queries In the previous section, we obtained strong evidence that variance is not constant over queries.
