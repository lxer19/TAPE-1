Abstract: This paper describes a computational technique for modeling and visualizing dynamical behaviors of complex systems in phase space. The technique employs a novel idea of flow pipes to model trajectory bundles that exhibit the same qualitative features. It parses a continuous phase space of a dynamical system, consisting of an infinite number of individual trajectories, into a manageable discrete collection of flow pipes that a computer can efficiently reason about. The technique provides a computational way for both machines and humans to visualize and manipulate dynamics of a physical system.

Reference-contexts: MAPS could also augment purely numerical measures with some invariant, symbolic characterizations. Many chaotic attractors, for example, the Rossler band <ref> [2] </ref>, are constructed with a stretching-and-folding operation. A symbolic description of the stretching-and-folding operation helps understand the fractal structures. In addition, MAPS could calibrate dimensions of the attractors and determine Liapunov exponents.

Reference-contexts: A flow pipe contains time information of the trajectory flow. The monotonic polyhedral pieces in a flow pipe approximate successive flow wave fronts indexed by the time. The flow pipe also characterizes the Liapunov exponent <ref> [5] </ref> of the flow with the expansion and contraction of a volume element, for example, the crossover section of the flow pipe, along the flow pipe.

Reference-contexts: The phase-plane method is able to analyze the transient and asymptotic behaviors of planar systems, whether linear or nonlinear. Kalman had used this method to design piecewise-linear switching control laws based on the phase-plane plot <ref> [7] </ref>. The phase-plane method is a useful tool for analyzing qualitative responses of a control system. It is, however, manual, prohibitively expensive, and confined to two-dimensional planes.

Reference-contexts: A particularly intuitive design method is the phase-plane method for analyzing and designing a second-order nonlinear control system in phase plane <ref> [9] </ref>. Let us consider an example of the deformation of an elastic column. Putting a weight on top of the column, the column oscillates around its principal axis. Putting a heavier weight, the column oscillates and settles to a buckled state after a short while.

Reference-contexts: However, the complexity of the algorithm grows exponentially with the dimensionality <ref> [10] </ref>. The number of trajectory points necessary to approximate flow pipe boundaries is also a function of the quality of the approximation. The computational complexity reflected in managing the large data structure for representing phase-space geometries needs to be addressed at a greater length in future research.

Reference-contexts: The discussion on model building is outside the scope of this thesis. We assume that the engineer is given a simple model for the column in the form of an equation of motion, a second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation <ref> [12] </ref>. Starting with the model and a set of typical parameter values, the engineer determines all possible responses of the system within certain ranges of amplitudes and input signals. The responses with different initial conditions from the simulation are then plotted in a two-dimensional plane|the phase plane (Figure 3).

The flow pipes discussed here are further geometric and dynamical characterizations of stability regions. The polyhedral modeling of stability regions provides a geometric structure for reasoning about the stability boundaries.

Reference-contexts: A brute-force, fine-grain search in high-dimensional phase spaces would be prohibitively expensive. The high-level description of phase space with flow pipes provide a way to efficiently reason about phase space structures and search for global control paths. Reference <ref> [15] </ref> details the use of the representation in control design. To use MAPS to perform an analysis, the user first tells MAPS about a system: he inputs the system model in terms of a differential equation, parameter values, and a phase-space region specifying bounds on state variables.

Reference-contexts: MAPS has helped design a high-performance nonlinear control law for an electro-mechanical system of practical interest|the stabilization of the German Transrapid magnetic levitation transportation system. Here, we briefly illustrate what MAPS does in this application and refer interested readers to reference <ref> [16] </ref> 4 for details of the design. MAPS analyzes the train and guideway system of the Transrapid, described by a third-order nonlinear differential equation. It discovers that the system is unstable at the operating equilibrium (140, 0, 100) for the magnet coil voltage at 140 volts.

Reference-contexts: We have applied the flow-pipe modeling technique to the automatic control synthesis and have constructed a computational environment, the control engineer's Workbench, integrating a suite of programs that automatically analyze and design high-performance, global controllers for a large class of nonlinear systems <ref> [17] </ref>. These programs combine powerful techniques from numerical and symbolic computations with novel representation and reasoning mechanisms of artificial intelligence. They reason about and manipulate the phase-space geometry and topology and search for optimal control paths connecting initial state and the desired state for the system. <p> The progressive movement of the flow wave front and its change in shape quantitatively describe the flow. 5.2 An example of flow pipes MAPS, together with the programs that automatically design control systems discussed elsewhere <ref> [17] </ref>, automates a significant portion of the control engineer's analysis and design task. In the following real scenario, MAPS autonomously analyzes the buckling motion of a steel column under compression.
