Reference-contexts: The large amount of monitored ICU data may create information overload, which leads to errors and mishaps in ICU care. There are occasional tragedies, most of which 24 are due to human error, reported in ICU care. In <ref> [1] </ref>, Abramson estimated that about 90 of 150 adverse occurrences in a surgical ICU were caused by human error. We may also find the similar results regarding human errors which happened in ICU care [29].

Reference-contexts: Historically, there were several hemodynamic models designed mainly for teach ing. In <ref> [2] </ref>, Beeuwkes first used the analog computer in the hemodynamics teaching laboratory at Harvard Medical School. In 1978, Katz and his colleagues introduced a real time digital computer model for hemodynamics [18]. In his model, he simulated a Windkessel circulation, which is an over-simplified model in hemodynamic analysis.

Reference-contexts: Other successes are less domain specific, such as INTELLECT, a powerful interface between decision makers and databases. But the problem is just what Gerald Sussman et al. said <ref> [3] </ref>, "The field overall ... is moving increasing attention to near-term applications, retarding progress toward comprehensive theories and deep scientific understanding, and ultimately, retarding progress toward developing the science needed for higher-impact applications." Part of the reason for people to focus on near-term applications is the growing anxiety and lack of <p> The history of the development of science tells us that AI is very unlikely to be a joke. Now it is time for us to focus on solving some fundamental questions of artificial intelligence. Shimon Ullman et al. said <ref> [3] </ref>, "Traditional approaches to artificial intelligence have been largely organized around unconstrained algorithms or simplistic biological models.

Reference-contexts: In addition, PAP monitoring can cause a disturbance of cardiac rhythm or conduction or both. Premature ventricular contractions occur very commonly when the catheter passes through the right ventricle. 2.4 An Example Case An example case in the domain of ICU patients with severe cardiovascular problems is shown below <ref> [7] </ref>: The patient is a 37 year old woman with a positive history for HIV and intravenous (IV) drug abuse. She was brought into an ICU with a fever of 104F, extreme lethargy, 33 scant urine output, and a tender abdomen, especially in the right upper quadrant. <p> A lumped-parameter cardiovascular model is used in our expert system to represent the patient's hemodynamic state. The cardiovascular simulator (CVsim) is a dynamic computer simulator of human cardiovascular hemodynamics <ref> [7] </ref>, originally intended for students of physiology and medicine in Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences & Technology (HST). <p> In that model, he defined the steady state operation of the ventricle, then combined two ventricles with a pulmonary circuit branch to simulate the effects of Starling heart-lung relationship. This work was considered as the starting point for integrative physiology <ref> [7] </ref>. Then in early 1960's, a six node electrical circuit model was proposed by Defares and his colleagues [8]. In that model, each node consists of a capacitor to ground and is connected to two adjacent nodes by impedances.

So information overload will become an increasingly serious problem unless better methods are designed to organize and present the data to the clinicians.

The first medical reasoning program, known as the MYCIN System [32], adopted symbolic processing techniques largely in response to a conviction that computer-based consultation systems, in order to be accepted by physicians, should be able to explain how and why a particular conclusion had been derived [32].

Reference-contexts: In his model, he simulated a Windkessel circulation, which is an over-simplified model in hemodynamic analysis. In 1982, Campbell et al. [4] developed a five component model for hemodynamics. In 37 that model, he incorporated linear vascular elastances , resistances and time-varying ventricular capacitances proposed in <ref> [34] </ref>. In 1984, as part of the Athena project at M.I.T., Prof. Roger Mark proposed to design a cardiovascular model as a teaching tool for Quantitative Physiology and Cardiovascular Pathophysiology courses to provide students a quantitative understanding of the hemodynamics system. <p> Then later on, we can integrate this unit with the peripheral system to form the model of the whole cardiovascular system. In <ref> [34] </ref>, Sagawa et al. stated that if we examined a series of ventricular pressure-volume loops for a range of different preloads and afterloads, we would find that the end systolic points all lie on a straight line. The diastolic pressure volume relation may also be described by a straight line.

Reference-contexts: way should knowledge be represented as symbolic data structures for computer use? * Knowledge Utilization: What designs are available for the inference procedure? * Knowledge Acquisition: How can we develop a systematic way for computers to access the knowledge? The earliest knowledge based systems date back to the mid 1960's <ref> [35] </ref>. One of the conspicuous systems was MACSYMA, developed by the Mathlab Group at Project MAC at M.I.T. MACSYMA can be used to provide a very broad range of symbolic computing capabilities, such as integration, power series and support for manipulating matrices [35]. <p> based systems date back to the mid 1960's <ref> [35] </ref>.

Another major early expert system is DENDRAL, developed by Stanford University and used to determine the three dimensional structure of a chemical compound from its chemical formula and some other information. The success of those early expert systems boosted the development of other expert systems. <p> In [10], Feigenbaum reported that there were about 1500 expert system applications in actual use and a few thousand more in field testing. Despite the broad range of applications and different domains, these systems focus on several central tasks <ref> [35] </ref>: 20 * Diagnosis: Focus on how to get a reasonable explanation for some abnormal values of observables. Examples include medical diagnosis, etc. * Selection: Focus on how to make intelligent selection. <p> Examples include insur ance, credit authorization, etc. * Configuration and planning: Focus on how to complete a partial design or adjust a complete design to meet some constraints. Examples include XCON. Parallel to the development of artificial intelligence, knowledge-based systems are also facing some fundamental problems <ref> [35] </ref>: * Fragility of Encoded Knowledge: How to incorporate common sense knowledge into the system? How to avoid common-sense-violating behavior? One of the biggest issues here is that human beings have too much common sense to explicitly encode in computers. * Complexity in the Real World: Many systems work well for

Reference-contexts: These systems were impressive, but their use revealed many 22 more problems, such as inadequate criteria for deciding when a diagnosis is complete <ref> [36] </ref>, and the need for better representation of anatomical and physiological medical knowledge [17]. Although several expert systems were developed for medical problem solving during the past couple of decades, AI has failed to make a significant impact on health care delivery [37].

First of all, most initial efforts in artificial intelligence in medicine (AIM) were focused on developing automated diagnosis systems, which make medical professionals nervous and unwilling to cooperate [37]. Other reasons are the complexity of medicine itself, including the complexity and inherent variability of human anatomy and physiology, and our lack of understanding of the medical decision process on a cognitive level. With the general dim outlook of artificial intelligence, AIM is also facing its greatest challenge.

Reference-contexts: A semantic net consists of nodes connected by arcs that describe the relations between nodes.The isa and has-part relations are basic relations in a semantic net. Semantic nets are very useful to represent knowledge in domains using taxonomies <ref> [38] </ref>. * A frame-based representation uses a frame to represent knowledge. A frame is very much like a semantic net. In a frame, the topmost nodes represent general concepts, and the lower nodes represent some instances of the concepts. <p> The concept at each node is defined as a collection of attributes and slots that are values of those attributes. Each slot can have several procedures attached to it. There are three commonly used procedures: If-added, If-removed, and If-needed procedures <ref> [38] </ref>. 4.2 Problem Statement In our present study, we used the CV simulator to generate "pseudo-clinical" test data which was representative of a variety of disease states.

Reference-contexts: As we can imagine, with the development of new techniques and medical equipment, the problem of information overloading will become more and more serious. The great responsibilities of ICU staff and high performance expectations can lead to both emotional and physical fatigue <ref> [39] </ref>. All of these factors may cause errors in patient care. Providing life support in the ICU is becoming an increasingly complex task as the volume of monitoring data increases. <p> The important features required of such a unit are listed as follows <ref> [39] </ref>: 1. High nurse-to-patient ratio 2. Ready accessibility of physicians 3. Ability to provide invasive hemodynamic monitoring 4. Availability of respiratory support techniques 5. Ability to provide supervised intravenous infusions of pharmacologic agents In severely ill patients, the interrelationship between different physiological systems must be noticed. <p> Therefore, a general guideline for admission and discharge of patients is required. The existence of such policies reduces the apparent ambiguity often inherent in the difficult environment of a ICU and enables prompt decision making by ICU staff <ref> [39] </ref>. An ICU usually can provide continuous and often invasive measurements of respiratory and hemodynamic status for severely ill patients. <p> The complexity of monitoring systems varies considerably, it can range from simple electrocardiographic monitoring with only a real-time screen display to automated "closed loop" systems to regulate intravenous infusions of fluids and drugs. The complications of intensive care usually are difficult to detect from the illness <ref> [39] </ref>. For example, cardiac arrhythmias and gastrointestinal hemorrhage are very common in ICU patients, but they may or may not necessarily relate to the care in the ICU. However, some complications are straightforward and clearly related to an intervention taking place in an ICU. <p> Respiratory rate can be measured and recorded automatically in non-intubated patients using impedance devices. Both respiratory rate and tidal volume delivered by the ventilator (V T ) can be monitored in intubated, spontaneously breathing patients using a spirometer and appropriate alarms <ref> [39] </ref>. For the mechanically ventilated patients, it is essential to monitor respiratory rate, exhaled V T , and airway pressure. <p> This measurement is useful in some clinical situations, such as evaluating oxygenation during sleep and during bron-choscopy procedures. Indwelling catheter electrodes for measurement of P a O 2 and P a CO 2 and arterial pH have been used but have some technical limitations <ref> [39] </ref>. There are four major complications related to respiratory support in ICU areas [39]: 1. Oxygen Therapy is administered by external devices. <p> Indwelling catheter electrodes for measurement of P a O 2 and P a CO 2 and arterial pH have been used but have some technical limitations <ref> [39] </ref>. There are four major complications related to respiratory support in ICU areas [39]: 1. Oxygen Therapy is administered by external devices. <p> However, tracheostomy has more disadvantages than advantages. Problems can include hemorrhage, mediastinal and tracheal stenosis. It may also cause pulmonary infection. 4. Mechanical Ventilation can have overventilation and underventilation problems. Oxygen toxicity usually occurs in patients being mechanically ventilated with gas mixtures containing high concentrations of oxygen <ref> [39] </ref>. 2.3 Hemodynamic Monitoring Since our project focuses on the interpretation of hemodynamic data, a detailed description of hemodynamic monitoring in the ICU is worthwhile. Most ICUs have the basic capacity to monitor and record heart rate and rhythm, venous pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, and systemic arterial pressure. <p> Most ICUs have the basic capacity to monitor and record heart rate and rhythm, venous pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, and systemic arterial pressure. Many units also have the instruments to measure cardiac output. Clinically, the following monitoring is usually done in ICU areas <ref> [39] </ref>: 1. Electrocardiagraphic Monitoring is of great value in patients with specific cardiac disorders such as acute myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmia. Also, because it is easy and relatively inexpensive, ECG monitoring has been widely used in ICU areas. <p> Airway Obstruction ! !" " ! ! " ! Right Ventricular Infarction # " ! #!" # ! !"

Reference-contexts: This led us to think about applying some traditional pattern recognition methods to this problem. In <ref> [40] </ref>, in order to solve some non-linear algebraic equations, the homotopy method was used. When we started to look for a good numerical method to do 46 this 23 dimensional search, we applied the homotopy method to our problem.

Reference-contexts: In other words, our expert system must be able to run CVsim iteratively, and search for the best match. Then the diagram of the current system was put forward in <ref> [41] </ref>, as shown in Figure 4-6. We first establish an initial value for each of the systemic input parameters. Then we run CVsim.
