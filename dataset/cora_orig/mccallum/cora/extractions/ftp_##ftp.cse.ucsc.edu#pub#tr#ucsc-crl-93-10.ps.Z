Abstract: We investigate here NP optimization problems from a logical definability standpoint. We show that the class of optimization problems whose optimum is definable using first-order formulae coincides with the class of polynomially bounded NP optimization problems on finite structures. After this, we analyze the relative expressive power of various classes of optimization problems that arise in this framework. Some of our results show that logical definability has different implications for NP maximization problems than it has for NP minimization problems, in terms of both expressive power and approximation properties. fl To appear in Information and Computation.

Reference-contexts: In addition, Panconesi and Ranjan [PR90] introduced and studied the class RMAX, a syntactic subclass of MAX 1 for which MAX CLIQUE is complete via an approximation preserving reduction. More recently, Arora and Safra <ref> [AS92] </ref> showed that, unless P=NP, MAX CLIQUE is not a constant-approximable problem. <p> MAX CLIQUE is the canonical example of a problem in RMAX. As mentioned in the Introduction, Arora and Safra <ref> [AS92] </ref> showed that MAX CLIQUE is not constant-approximable, unless P=NP. Remark 2: We now consider briefly the effect of taking the A-closure of the classes MAX n and MAX n , i.e., all optimization problems that have an A-reduction to a problem in one of these classes.

Let w be a finite sequences of variables. We shall write (w) to indicate that w is the sequence of the free variables of the formula . <p> of all vertices with the property that all their neighbors are in S. 6 It is well known that every formula of first-order logic is equivalent to a formula in prenex normal form, i.e., to a formula in which all quantifiers are to the left of all other symbols (cf. <ref> [End72, pages 150-151] </ref>). We write n ; n 1, for the class of first-order formulae in prenex normal form that have n 1 alternations of quantifiers and start with a block of existential quantifiers.

More recently, Arora and Safra [AS92] showed that, unless P=NP, MAX CLIQUE is not a constant-approximable problem. <p> More specifically, we prove that MAX CONNECTED COMPONENT is in MAX 2 , but not in MAX 1 , while MAX SAT separates MAX 1 from MAX 0 . As mentioned above, MAX CLIQUE is in MAX 1 , but not in MAX 1 (cf. <ref> [PR90] </ref>). We focus next on the logical definability of NP-minimization problems.

We now restrict attention to polynomially bounded NP optimization problems [BJY89, LM81]. <p> have that opt Q (A) = min jfw : (A; S) j= (w; S)gj: The classes MAX 0 and MAX 1 were introduced and studied by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [PY91] under the names MAX SNP and MAX NP respectively, while the class MAX 1 was introduced by Panconesi and Ranjan <ref> [PR90] </ref>. We have chosen to use different names for MAX SNP and MAX NP here, because we are interested in having a uniform notation and terminology for all the classes of optimization problems obtained using first-order formulae. <p> max jfw : (A (I); S) j= (9y)[C (w)^ Intuitively, in the above formulae for MAX SAT and MAX 3SAT the predicate symbol S encodes a truth assignment, i.e., it consists of the Boolean variables that are set to TRUE. * MAX CLIQUE is in the class MAX 1 (cf. <ref> [PR90] </ref>). <p> In particular, it shows that MAX 2 MAX 2 . By restricting the quantifier prefix 9 fl 8 fl of 2 formulae, we obtain the class MAX 1 of <ref> [PR90] </ref>, and the classes MAX 1 = MAX NP and MAX 0 = MAX SNP of [PY91]. <p> In particular, * MAX CONNECTED COMPONENT is in MAX 2 , but not in MAX 1 . * MAX CLIQUE is in MAX 1 , but not in MAX 1 (cf. <ref> [PR90] </ref>). * MAX SAT is in MAX 1 , but not in MAX 0 . Proof: We give this proof in four parts. Part A: In this part we prove that MAX 2 is contained in the class MAX 1 . <p> Thus, we have arrived at a contradiction. Part C: As mentioned in the Introduction, D. Kozen showed that MAX CLIQUE is in the class MAX 1 , but not in the class MAX 1 (cf. <ref> [PR90] </ref>). Part D: We have seen before that MAX SAT is in the class MAX 1 . In this part of the proof we show that MAX SAT is not in the class MAX 0 . <p> Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [PY91] introduced a notion of L-reduction between optimization problems. Panconesi and Ranjan <ref> [PR90] </ref> generalized this to the notion of P -reduction. We use here a variant of these reductions introduced by Crescenzi and Panconesi [CP91]. Definition 5.2: [CP91] Let Q and R be two NP optimization problems. <p> It follows that Q is A-reducible to MIN k-HYPERVERTEX COVER and so MIN k-HYPERVERTEX COVER is complete for MIN F 1 (k). 2 The good approximation properties of the class MIN F 1 should be contrasted with those of the class RMAX introduced in <ref> [PR90] </ref>. This is a syntactic subclass of MAX 1 that is in some sense the "dual" of MIN F 1 . <p> Indeed, it can be shown that MAX 1 contains problems that are complete for the class MAX 2 via A-reductions, such as the MAX Number of Satisfiable Formulae (MAX NSF) problem of <ref> [PR90] </ref>. As a result, the A-closure of MAX 1 contains all polynomially bounded maximization problems. It should be pointed out that a similar situation holds with NP decision problems. <p> It is an open problem to identify a natural class of minimization problems for which the TRAVELING SALESMAN problem with distances 1; 2 is complete. Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [PY91] proved that MAX 3SAT and a host of other problems are complete for MAX 0 . Panconesi and Ranjan <ref> [PR90] </ref> introduced the problem MAX Number of Satisfiable Formulae (MAX NSF) and proved it complete for MAX 1 . As mentioned earlier, it can be shown that this problem is also complete for the class MAX 2 = MAX PB.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 7 shows that the class MIN F + 1 is a first step in this direction. The TRAVELING SALESMAN problem with possible distances 1 or 2 is an important example of a minimization problem that is constant-approximable.

It is an open problem to identify a natural class of minimization problems for which the TRAVELING SALESMAN problem with distances 1; 2 is complete.

Their main motivation came from Fagin's [Fag74] characterization of NP in terms of definability in second-order logic on finite structures. <p> Thus, a class C of finite structures is NP-computable if and only if there is a formula (9S)(8x)(9y) (x; y; S), with quantifier-free, such that for every finite structure A we have that A 2 C () A j= (9S)(8x)(9y) (x; y; S): Papadimitriou and Yannakakis <ref> [PY91] </ref> introduced the class MAX NP of maximization problems whose optimum can be defined as max jfx : (A; S) j= (9y) (x; y; S)gj; where is quantifier-free. <p> The canonical example of a problem in MAX NP is provided by MAX SAT, which asks for the maximum number of clauses that can be satisfied in a given Boolean formula. Papadimitriou and Yannakakis <ref> [PY91] </ref> showed that for every optimization problem in MAX NP is constant-approximable, i.e., there is a polynomial time algorithm that approximates the optimum value of the problem within a constant factor. <p> As mentioned above, MAX CLIQUE is in MAX 1 , but not in MAX 1 (cf. [PR90]). We focus next on the logical definability of NP-minimization problems. Panconesi and Ranjan [PR90] concentrated on maximization problems only, while Papadimitriou and Yannakakis <ref> [PY91] </ref> examined approximation properties of certain minimization problems by reducing them to maximization problems. At first sight, one may expect that hierarchy and proper containment results about classes of maximization problems should translate directly to analogous results about classes of minimization problems definable by similar formulae. <p> proper hierarchy with exactly two levels: MIN 0 = MIN 1 MIN 1 = MIN 2 : We also show that MIN CHROMATIC NUMBER witnesses the separation between the two levels, namely, this problem is in MIN 1 , but not in MIN 1 , Recall that Papadimitriou and Yannakakis <ref> [PY91] </ref> showed that every maximization problem in MAX 1 = MAX NP (and, hence, every problem in MAX 0 = MAX SNP) 3 is constant-approximable. In contrast, we prove here that MIN 0 contains natural minimization problems, such as MIN 3NON-TAUTOLOGY, that are not constant-approximable, unless P=NP. <p> n formula (w; S) with predicate symbols among those in and S such that for every instance A of Q we have that opt Q (A) = min jfw : (A; S) j= (w; S)gj: The classes MAX 0 and MAX 1 were introduced and studied by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis <ref> [PY91] </ref> under the names MAX SNP and MAX NP respectively, while the class MAX 1 was introduced by Panconesi and Ranjan [PR90]. <p> Moreover, the notation n and n is consistent with the notation p n and p n used for the polynomial hierarchy [Sto76].

This problem asks for the maximum number of clauses that can be satisfied in a given Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) with three literals per clause. <p> ) _ S (w 2 ) _ S (w 3 )) _ C 1 (w 1 ; w 2 ; w 3 ) ^ (:S (w 1 ) _ S (w 2 ) _ S (w 3 ))_ * MAX SAT is a problem in the class MAX 1 (cf. <ref> [PY91] </ref>). <p> In particular, it shows that MAX 2 MAX 2 . By restricting the quantifier prefix 9 fl 8 fl of 2 formulae, we obtain the class MAX 1 of [PR90], and the classes MAX 1 = MAX NP and MAX 0 = MAX SNP of <ref> [PY91] </ref>. It is clear that we have the following containments between these classes: MAX 1 MAX 1 We saw before examples of natural problems in the classes MAX 0 , MAX 1 , and MAX 1 . <p> For maximization problems we also require that * &lt; 1, otherwise all maximization problems would be trivially constant-approximable. MAX 3SAT, MAX SAT, MIN VERTEX COVER, and TRAVELING SALESMAN with -inequality are important examples of constant-approximable optimization problems. Papadimitriou and Yannakakis <ref> [PY91] </ref> proved that every problem in MAX 1 (and, a fortiori, every problem in MAX 0 ) is constant-approximable. In contrast to this, we show below that MIN 0 contains natural problems that are not constant-approximable, unless P6=NP. <p> Thus, we have exhibited a polynomial time algorithm for solving an NP-complete problem, which implies that P=NP. 2 We now consider an approximation preserving reduction and in Theorem 6 we prove that MIN 3NT is a complete problem for the class MIN 0 under this reduction. Papadimitriou and Yannakakis <ref> [PY91] </ref> introduced a notion of L-reduction between optimization problems. Panconesi and Ranjan [PR90] generalized this to the notion of P -reduction. We use here a variant of these reductions introduced by Crescenzi and Panconesi [CP91]. Definition 5.2: [CP91] Let Q and R be two NP optimization problems. <p> If there is an A-reduction form Q to R, then we say that Q is Areducible to R and we write Q A R, The A-reduction defined above is a more relaxed reducibility than the L-reduction defined by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis <ref> [PY91] </ref>. In the latter the optimum solutions of the two problems Q and R are required to be within a constant factor of each other. Although this is the case with many optimization problems, a reduction may preserve approximability (within a constant factor of the optimal) without having this property. <p> One of our findings is that logical definability has different implications for NP maximization problems than it has for NP minimization problems. The original motivation in <ref> [PY91] </ref> for pursuing the logical definability approach was to find syntactic classes of NP maximization problems with good approximation properties, such as MAX 1 , and to pinpoint natural complete problems for these classes. <p> It is an open problem to identify a natural class of minimization problems for which the TRAVELING SALESMAN problem with distances 1; 2 is complete. Papadimitriou and Yannakakis <ref> [PY91] </ref> proved that MAX 3SAT and a host of other problems are complete for MAX 0 . Panconesi and Ranjan [PR90] introduced the problem MAX Number of Satisfiable Formulae (MAX NSF) and proved it complete for MAX 1 .

Reference-contexts: This, in turn, made it possible to develop a rich structural complexity theory based on polynomial time reductions and to obtain various classifications of NP problems. There have been also several attempts to classify optimization problems and to study their structural properties. Some notable contributions include <ref> [OM90, Kre88, Wag86, PM81, ADP80, Joh74] </ref> (cf. also [BJY89] for a comprehensive survey of results in this area). Nevertheless, the absence of robust computational models for optimization problems has hindered the development of a structural optimization theory that is on a par with structural complexity theory.
