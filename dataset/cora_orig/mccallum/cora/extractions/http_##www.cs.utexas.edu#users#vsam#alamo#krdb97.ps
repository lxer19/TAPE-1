Abstract: We are developing an architecture, Alamo, that addresses both the semantic and physical aspects of data integration. The Alamo architecture permits the interoperability of both data sources and semantic components. As a collection, the supported semantic components capture most basic forms of knowledge representation. Since the semantic integration of heterogeneous data sources requires some representation of the semantic content of the data source, the Alamo architecture forms an infrastructure for the development and possible integration of different forms of semantic integration of heterogeneous data sources. fl This research is partially funded by DARPA, contract number: F30602-96-2-0226 and the Applied Research Laboratories Univ. of Texas, Internal Research Development Program.

Reference-contexts: These abstractions have been borrowed from the Genesis extensible DBMS, a component based DBMS. The same abstractions have been further exploited in the definition of several follow-on systems and proven apt in several applications including the implementation of forward-chaining rule-systems <ref> [He93] </ref>. We use the term marking as it is the term coined by Stonebraker as a category in a taxonomy of approaches to the implementation of rule systems in databases [Sto92]. <p> It happens that these marking primitives have been exploited for the development of good, if not optimal algorithms, in each of relational query possessing, object-oriented query processing, forward-chaining rule systems, logic programming and truth maintenance systems <ref> [De90, BaMi94, SaMi96, He93, KuLi88] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It provides basic access to the data in a very efficient way, which makes it the tool of choice for massive data applications, like Decision Support. There are also numerous extensions to the basic relational calculus and algebra. One of these is presented in <ref> [KLK91] </ref>, where it is argued that second-order relational queries (i.e. queries over the schema, as well as over the data) are often required for data integration.

Reference-contexts: The main functionality of IM would be implemented by a semantic module, which would perform plan generation and execution, as described in <ref> [LRO96] </ref>. 5 Conclusion and Status Our primary observation is that despite different terminology there is a common collection of techniques that are often used in the construction of knowledge-based systems and that these techniques are expressible in terms of a simple extension to standard cursor definitions.

Reference-contexts: Our hope is that Alamo will serve as a basis for establishing much larger collaborative efforts. We are underway in the construction of simplified data pumps and the integration of the ASM interface with a query engine and the Venus rule language compiler <ref> [MiOb96] </ref>. Inspection of the Coral deductive database system reveals a promising integration root with the ASM. Since both Venus and Coral are reasonably mature systems we anticipate a much more modest implementation effort than may first come across.

Reference-contexts: We use the term marking as it is the term coined by Stonebraker as a category in a taxonomy of approaches to the implementation of rule systems in databases <ref> [Sto92] </ref>. Consider that to solve many problems multiple passes may have to be made over the same data set and instance specific relations between pairs of data sets may be discovered.
