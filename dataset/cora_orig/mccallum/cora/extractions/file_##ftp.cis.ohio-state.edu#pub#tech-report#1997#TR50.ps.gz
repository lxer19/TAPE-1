Abstract: Networks of Workstations (NOW) have become an attractive alternative platform for high performance computing. Due to the commodity nature of workstations and interconnects, the NOW environments are being gradually redefined as Heterogeneous Networks of Workstations (HNOW) environments. This paper presents a new framework to implement collective communication operations (as defined by the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard) efficiently for the emerging HNOW environments. We first classify different types of heterogeneity in HNOW and then focus on one important characteristic: communication capabilities of workstations. By taking this characteristic into account, we propose a new Speed-Partitioned Ordered Chain (SPOC) approach to order the participating nodes of a given collective communication operation in an optimal fashion. Such an ordering allows flexibility to implement collective communication operations with lower latency. Using the new approach, a set of tree-based algorithms are proposed for frequently used collective communication operations such as broadcast, multicast, and barrier synchronization. All these algorithms are compared with the standard MPI implementations on experimental as well as simulated testbeds. On a 16-node existing HNOW environment with SGI workstations and ATM interconnection, our approach reduces the latency of broadcast, multi-cast, and barrier synchronization operations by a factor of up to 1:4 compared to the existing MPICH implementation. On a 64-node simulated testbed, our approach promises to reduce the latency of broadcast operation by a factor of up to 4:8 compared to the MPI implementations. Improvements up to a factor of 3:3 and 2:3 are observed for multicast and barrier synchronization, respectively. Thus, these results demonstrate significant potential to be applied towards designing scalable collective communication libraries for current and future generation HNOW environments.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Networks of Workstations (NOW) are becoming increasingly popular for providing cost-effective and affordable parallel computing for day-to-day computational needs <ref> [1, 31] </ref>. Such environments consist of clusters of workstations connected by Local Area Networks (LANs). Hardware and software LAN technology was not initially developed for parallel processing, and thus the communication overhead between workstations can be quite high.

Reference-contexts: However, most of these research projects focus on homogeneous NOW systems where similar kinds of workstations (nodes) are connected over a single network architecture. Some popular network architectures used in the current NOW environments are Ethernet, ATM <ref> [2] </ref>, Myrinet [4], FDDI, Cut-through switches like SP-2 [30], and Fiber-Channel. Due to the commodity nature of workstations and networking equipment, LAN environments are gradually becoming heterogeneous. <p> Thus, algorithms for collective communication need to take care of these characteristics to achieve reduced latency. Communication protocols: Current generation LANs typically support different communication protocols (such as TCP/IP, ATM <ref> [2] </ref>, and FM [25]) which workstations (nodes) use to communicate. These protocols have their own characteristics and affect the latency of communication operations. Furthermore, some nodes may have access to more than one set of protocols.

Reference-contexts: The need for collective communication operations such as broadcast, multicast, global reduction, scatter, gather, complete exchange, and barrier synchronization arises frequently in parallel applications <ref> [27, 5, 3, 10, 19, 22, 15] </ref>. Thus, it is critical that the collective communication operations be implemented in the best possible manner (scalable as well as high performance) in a HNOW system. Recently, some projects have emphasized issues related to collective communication in NOW systems.
