Abstract: The increasing demands for in-situ statistical process control (SPC) in the semiconductor industry have elevated the need for high performance metrology. As we move to deep submicron technology and larger wafers, the accuracy and repeatability of the metrology system becomes more and more important for capturing the temporal and spatial process variation. In this paper we describe a set of statistical techniques for improving and evaluating a reectometry metrology system. Our techniques include experiment design and Bayesian analysis that help us to focus only on the active factors while ignoring those that are statistically insignificant. Bootstrap evaluation of the metrology is performed based on those active factors. It is expected that this methodology will greatly facilitate the speed and characterization of in-situ metrology, which is essential to modern control applications. Modern inspection instruments usually encompass of complex model that is needed to extract useful information from the physical observation. These models often contain unknown parameters, whose values must be estimated. For example, in the reectometry system, considering the uctuation of the probed material, all the parameters that describe the dispersion equations, as well as thin-film thickness comprise the metrology space. The performance of metrology is inuenced by the physical measurement mechanism, the embedded numerical algorithm and the metrology space. We define the metrology space as the Cartesian space spanned by the extractable parameters of the sensor model. In advanced metrology, the dimension of the metrology space is usually fairly large. Let us now focus on the two major problems that can diminish the performance of metrology: the high dimension of the metrology space and the high computational cost of the sensor model. Higher dimension usually affects speed and accuracy. Fortunately, due to the principle of factor sparsity, it is often the case that of the many potentially important variables, only a few are truly important or active, while the rest are inert. To systematically address these problems, we follow the strategy shown in Fig. 1. We start by identifying the possibly important factors. Then we conduct one or more small, carefully designed simulated experiments. Through Bayesian variable screening, we identity those variables that are truly important Based on the reduced metrology space, we then conduct a statistical evaluation. Because of the reduction of metrology parameter space, the computational cost of metrology is drastically reduced.

Reference-contexts: In this work, we use two-level fractional factorial designs with resolution III, IV or V, because of their effectiveness. The results of an experiment are interpreted according to the significance of each factor <ref> [1] </ref>. A common strategy in analyzing designs is to focus on those factors whose main effects are most significant, while initially discounting the possibility of interactions between factors. <p> One common method for screening variables is with the use of normal probability plots <ref> [1] </ref>. The disadvantage of this method is that the interpretation of these plots is somewhat subjective, especially for those factors that are neither obviously active nor obviously inert. Also, because these plots require interpretation, this method is unsuitable for automated screening in SPC applications.

Reference-contexts: The disadvantage of this method is that the interpretation of these plots is somewhat subjective, especially for those factors that are neither obviously active nor obviously inert. Also, because these plots require interpretation, this method is unsuitable for automated screening in SPC applications. Box and Meyer <ref> [2] </ref> proposed a Bayesian procedure that, with the assumption of effect sparsity, produces the posterior probability of all the effects. The prior probability represents the prior knowledge about the chances that a factor is active; Bayesian methods adjust this prior knowledge according to sampled data from designed experiments.

Reference-contexts: An effect having a posterior probability greater than 0.5 is deemed to be more likely active than inert. Eq (5) can be calculated efficiently by numerical integration. Bootstrap <ref> [3] </ref> is an approach to calculate confidence intervals for parameters in situations where the standard statistical methods are difficult. The Bootstrap algorithm begins by generating a large number of independent Bootstrap samples, then estimates the desired statistics from these samples.

Reference-contexts: Since there exist local minimums during the solution of Eq (1) for a multiple-layer thin-film system, traditional optimization algorithms are not appropriate here. To find the global minimum, in this work we use stochastic methods, such as simulated annealing <ref> [5] </ref>. The major advantage of simulated annealing over other methods is its ability to avoid becoming trapped at local minimums. The algorithm employs a random search, which not only accepts changes that decrease the objective function, but also some changes that increase it, at least temporarily.

Reference-contexts: Strategy of statistical enhancement on a metrology system. - 2 - 2.0 Multi-layer Reectometry and Simulated Annealing Because of its experimental simplicity, normal incidence reectometry is often integrated into the real-time process control paradigm for several reasons: good spatial resolution, high throughput, high precision, good accuracy and ease of automation <ref> [6] </ref>. Often in semiconductor thin-film reectometry, the spectral reectance of a sample is measured through relative reectance methods by using a bare wafer as a standard. The theoretical reectance can be calculated from the optical properties and thickness of each film.
