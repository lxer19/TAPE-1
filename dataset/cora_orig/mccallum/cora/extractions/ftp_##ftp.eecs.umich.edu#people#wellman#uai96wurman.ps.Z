Abstract: We examine a standard factory scheduling problem with stochastic processing and setup times, minimizing the expectation of the weighted number of tardy jobs. Because the costs of operators in the schedule are stochastic and sequence dependent, standard dynamic programming algorithms such as A* may fail to find the optimal schedule. The SDA* (Stochastic Dominance A*) algorithm remedies this difficulty by relaxing the pruning condition. We present an improved state-space search formulation for these problems and discuss the conditions under which stochastic scheduling problems can be solved optimally using SDA*. In empirical testing on randomly generated problems, we found that in 70%, the expected cost of the optimal stochastic solution is lower than that of the solution derived using a deterministic ap proximation, with comparable search effort.

Reference-contexts: The complexity hierarchy for stochastic problems is less fully characterized than that for deterministic problems. In many instances, the stochastic versions of scheduling problems are harder than the deterministic ones. For selected objective functions, the optimal policies for deterministic job scheduling problems are optimal for their stochastic counterparts <ref> (Crabill and Maxwell 1969) </ref>. However, under the assumption that processing times are exponentially distributed, some problems whose deterministic versions are NP-complete have been shown to have polynomial time stochastic solutions (Pinedo 1981; Derman, Lieber-man, and Ross 1978).

Nova's factory manufactures six products with the production data summarized in Table 6. We considered the processing and setup times to be normal distributions truncated at 4 standard deviations. This allowed efficient convolution and stochastic dominance calculations.

Reference-contexts: The challenging scheduling problems occur when demand is greater than capacity. Although uncertainty in processing times is widely acknowledged, few approaches produce strictly optimal schedules in stochastic lot-sizing problems. We present a general approach based on SDA* (Stochastic Dominance A*), a state-space search algorithm designed for uncertain, path-dependent costs <ref> (Wellman, Ford, and Larson 1995) </ref>. To apply SDA* to scheduling problems, we must extend the algorithm to handle multidimensional cost structures. In the next section we provide motivation for the problem. <p> We have previously shown <ref> (Wellman, Ford, and Larson 1995) </ref> that if paths A and A 0 lead to the same state and C (A) SD C (A 0 ), then A 0 cannot be part of a uniquely optimal solution. <p> This relaxation opens the door for operator costs that vary depending upon the path taken to a node. The need for a consistency condition to retain optimality when costs are path dependent was recognized by Kaufman and Smith (1993), and extended to the stochastic case in <ref> (Wellman, Ford, and Larson 1995) </ref>. 7 FUTURE WORK Although the analysis above focuses on one specific class of scheduling problems, the technique described is more widely applicable.

Reference-contexts: Carraway, et al. (1990) proposed generalized dynamic programming as a method for finding optimal solutions to problems where utility is a function of multiple deterministic attributes. This concept was extend to A* search by adding heuristics <ref> (White, Stewart, and Car-raway 1992) </ref>. Stewart and White (1991) proposed mul-tiobjective A* (MOA*) for cases where the attributes cannot be mapped into a single utility function, though it works equally well for cases where the utility can be fully evaluated in goal states but not in intermediate states.
