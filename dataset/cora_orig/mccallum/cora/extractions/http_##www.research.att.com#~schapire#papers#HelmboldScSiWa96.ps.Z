Abstract: We present an on-line investment algorithm which achieves almost the same wealth as the best constant-rebalanced portfolio determined in hindsight from the actual market outcomes. The algorithm employs a multiplicative update rule derived using a framework introduced by Kivinen and Warmuth. Our algorithm is very simple to implement and requires only constant storage and computing time per stock in each trading period. We tested the performance of our algorithm on real stock data from the New York Stock Exchange accumulated during a 22-year period. On this data, our algorithm clearly outperforms the best single stock as well as Cover's universal portfolio selection algorithm. We also present results for the situation in which the investor has access to additional "side information."

Reference-contexts: Our algorithm is very simple to implement and its time and storage requirements grow linearly in the number of stocks. Experiments on real New York Stock Exchange data indicate that our algorithm outperforms Cover's <ref> [9] </ref> universal portfolio algorithm. The following simple example demonstrates the power of constant-rebalanced portfolio strategies. Assume that two investments are available. The first is a risk-free, no-growth investment stock whose value never changes. The second investment is a hypothetical highly volatile stock. <p> Investment strategies which maintain a fixed fraction of the total wealth in each of the underlying investments, like the one described above, are called constant-rebalanced portfolio strategies. Previously, Cover <ref> [9] </ref> described a portfolio-selection algorithm that provably performs "almost as well" as the best constant-rebalanced portfolio. In this paper, we describe a new algorithm with similar properties. Like the results for Cover's algorithm, this performance property is proven without making any statistical assumptions on the nature of the stock market. <p> Obviously, the optimal vector w ? can only be computed after the entire sequence of price relatives is known (at which point, it is no longer of value). However, the algorithm described in this paper (as well as Cover's <ref> [9] </ref> algorithm) performs almost as well as w ? while using only the previously observed history of price relatives to make each day's investment decision. 2.3 Universal portfolios Cover [9] introduced the notion of universal portfolio. <p> However, the algorithm described in this paper (as well as Cover's <ref> [9] </ref> algorithm) performs almost as well as w ? while using only the previously observed history of price relatives to make each day's investment decision. 2.3 Universal portfolios Cover [9] introduced the notion of universal portfolio. <p> Cover and Gluss [10] considered the restricted case where the set of price relatives is finite and gave an investment scheme with universal properties. The most closely related previous results are by Cover <ref> [9] </ref> and Cover and Ordentlich [11]. They prove that certain investment strategies are universal without making any statistical assumptions on the nature of the stock market. Cover [9] proved that the wealth achieved by his universal portfolio algorithm is "almost as large" as the best constant-rebalanced portfolio. <p> The most closely related previous results are by Cover <ref> [9] </ref> and Cover and Ordentlich [11]. They prove that certain investment strategies are universal without making any statistical assumptions on the nature of the stock market. Cover [9] proved that the wealth achieved by his universal portfolio algorithm is "almost as large" as the best constant-rebalanced portfolio. <p> That is, w t = w S t1 (w) d (w) S t1 (w) d (w) where d is one of the Dirichlet distributions mentioned above. Note that the portfolio vectors are weighted according to their past performance, S t1 (w), as well as the prior (w). Discrete approximation <ref> [9] </ref> or recursive series expansion [11] are used to evaluate the above integrals. In both cases, however, the time and space required for finding the new portfolio vector appears to grow exponentially in the number of stocks. <p> We term the latter method the Exact EG ()-update. We compared the results for all subsets of stocks considered by Cover <ref> [9] </ref> in his experiments. Summarizing our results, we found that, perhaps surprisingly, the wealth achieved by the EG ()- update was larger than the wealth achieved by the universal portfolio algorithm. This outcome is contrary to the superior worst-case bounds proved for the universal portfolio algorithm. <p> The Exact EG ()-update yields a similar factor of 70:91. The results of the wealth achieved over the 22 years are given for this pair of stocks, as well as other pairs, in Table 1. We observed qualitatively similar results for the different portfolios considered by Cover <ref> [9] </ref>: Commercial Metals and Kin Ark (see also Figure 1), Commercial Metals and Meicco Corp., and IBM and Coca Cola (Figure 2). In all cases, the wealth achieved by EG () and the Exact EG () is larger than the wealth of the universal portfolio algorithm. <p> Although both algorithms tended to keep similar portfolios, the universal portfolio algorithm changed its investment proportions more aggressively when Kin Ark rose around days 300-500. 12 update, the universal portfolio algorithm and the best stock for a portfolio consisting of Commercial Metals and Kin Ark. 5.1 Margin loans Following Cover <ref> [9] </ref>, we also tested the case where the portfolio can buy stocks on margin. This case can be modeled by adding an additional "margin component" for each stock to the vector of price relatives. We assumed that all margin purchases were made 50% down and with a 50% loan. <p> To compute updates for the universal portfolio algorithm, we used a sampling technique as described by Cover <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The theoretical bound we prove on the performance of our algorithm relative to the best constant-rebalanced portfolio is not as strong as the bound proved by Cover and Ordentlich <ref> [11] </ref>. However, the time and space required for our algorithm is linear in the number of stocks whereas Cover's algorithm is exponential in the number of stocks. <p> Moreover, we tested our algorithm experi mentally on historical data from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) accumulated over a 22-year period, and found that our algorithm clearly outperforms the algorithm of Cover and Ordentlich. Following Cover and Ordentlich <ref> [11] </ref>, we also present results for the situation in which the investor has some finite "side information," such as the current interest rate. Side information may provide hints to the investor that one or a set of stocks are likely to outperform the other stocks in the portfolio. <p> Side information such as prevailing interest rates or consumer-confidence figures can indicate which stocks are likely to outperform the other stocks in the portfolio. Following Cover and Ordentlich <ref> [11] </ref>, we denote the side information by an integer y from a finite set f1; 2; : : :; Kg. Thus, the behavior of the market including the side information is now denoted by the sequence fx t ; y t g.

Thus, the behavior of the market including the side information is now denoted by the sequence fx t ; y t g. Following Cover and Ordentlich [11], we allow the constant-rebalanced portfolio to exploit the side information by expanding the single portfolio into a set of portfolios, one for each possible value of the side information. <p> One can easily define a notion of universality analogous to the definition given in Section 2.3. As noticed by Cover and Ordentlich <ref> [11] </ref>, the investor can partition the trading days based on the side information, and treat each partition separately. Exploiting the side information is therefore no more difficult than running K copies of our algorithm, one for each possible value of the side information. <p> Cover and Gluss [10] considered the restricted case where the set of price relatives is finite and gave an investment scheme with universal properties.

Cover [9] proved that the wealth achieved by his universal portfolio algorithm is "almost as large" as the best constant-rebalanced portfolio. His analysis was improved by Cover and Ordentlich [11] who also introduced the notion of side information, and generalized Cover's algorithm to use the Dirichlet (1=2; : : : ; 1=2) and the Dirichlet (1; : : : ; 1) priors over the set of all possible portfolio vectors. <p> Note that the portfolio vectors are weighted according to their past performance, S t1 (w), as well as the prior (w).

In terms of the number of trading days T , their bounds are much superior, especially compared to our bound for g EG (ff; ). <p> The difference in performance was largest for portfolios composed of volatile stocks. Furthermore, the universal portfolio strategy using the Dirichlet (1; : : : ; 1) prior outperformed the Dirichlet (1=2; : : : ; 1=2) prior, despite the better bounds proved by Cover and Ordentlich <ref> [11] </ref> for the Dirichlet (1=2; : : : ; 1=2) prior. We therefore used the Dirichlet (1; : : : ; 1) prior when generating all of the universal portfolio results reported in this section.

Reference-contexts: One possible approach is to use an iterative optimization algorithm, such as gradient projection, to find the maximum vector w t+1 that maximizes F under the constraint P N i = 1 (see, for instance, Fletcher <ref> [12] </ref>). This approach is time consuming as it requires solving a different non-linear equation on each trading period.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We present an on-line investment algorithm which achieves almost the same wealth as the best constant-rebalanced portfolio investment strategy.

Our algorithm is very simple to implement and its time and storage requirements grow linearly in the number of stocks. Experiments on real New York Stock Exchange data indicate that our algorithm outperforms Cover's [9] universal portfolio algorithm. The following simple example demonstrates the power of constant-rebalanced portfolio strategies. <p> and Ordentlich are stronger than ours, we show that on historical stock data our algorithm performs better while requiring time and space linear in the number of stocks. 3 Multiplicative portfolio selection algorithms Our framework for updating a portfolio vector is analogous to the framework developed by Kivinen and Warmuth <ref> [20] </ref> for on-line regression. In this on-line framework the portfolio vector itself encapsulates the necessary information from the previous price relatives. <p> One of the main contributions of this line of work is the use of the relative entropy as a distance function for motivating updates: D RE (ujjv) def N X u i log v i Many other on-line algorithms with multiplicative weight updates <ref> [21, 3, 20, 14] </ref> are also motivated by this distance function and are thus rooted in the minimum relative entropy principle of Kull-back [18, 13]. To derive learning rules using relative entropy, we set d (w t+1 ; w t ) = D RE (w t+1 jjw t ). <p> N i = 1 gives a portfolio update which we call the exponentiated gradient (EG ()) update: w t+1 w t i =w t x t j=1 w t j =w t x t A similar update for the case of linear regression was first given by Kivinen and Warmuth <ref> [20] </ref>. In addition to the updates, we also need to choose an initial portfolio vector w 1 .
