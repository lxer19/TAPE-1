Title: Gridded-Channel Network Routing with Crosstalk Constraints

Abstract: As technology enables placement of wires to be made on an increasingly finer scale, crosstalk becomes a more influential factor on wire routing. This paper proposes a gridded network routing algorithm intended to maximize the number of networks that are routed while satisfying their crosstalk constraints, meanwhile minimizing the wire length needed to connect the networks and the number of pins needed in the connection. This algorithm, called the Simple Network-routing Algorithm with Crosstalk Constraints (SNACC) is particularly effective when the amount of crosstalk that can be tolerated is small compared to the length of the wire.

Reference-contexts: Zhou and Wong (1996) perform river routing with crosstalk constraints, and further optimize their results to reduce the number of bends in the nets. Less standard approaches include the use of a neural network to deduce multilayer channel routes that have the desirable features of small crosstalk values <ref> (Funabiki et al. 1997) </ref>, and the use of genetic algorithms to find good routings that satisfy crosstalk constraints. (Lienig 1997). This paper intends to explore the area of network routing with crosstalk constraints, an area hitherto unexplored.

Reference-contexts: The crosstalk between two perpendicular wire segments is small in comparison to the crosstalk between two parallel wires. <ref> (Gao 1994) </ref>. The crosstalk between two nets usually adds in a linear fashion, and it is bounded above by the summation of the crosstalk of each of the wire segments in one net with each of the wire segments in the other net. <p> Typically, during the design stage, a maximum tolerable crosstalk is specified for each net if the circuit is to function properly. This constraint is called a crosstalk constraint. <ref> (Gao 1994) </ref>. 1.2 Crosstalk Calculation Approximations It is critical for network routing to respect crosstalk constraints if the VLSI component is to work correctly. <p> This problem has been shown to be NP-Complete. <ref> (Gao 1994) </ref>. 1.4 Goal of this Paper A substantial amount of research has already been performed in the area of channel routing with crosstalk constraints. Gridless channel routing, with the ability to add arbitrary number of channels, is explored in Chen and Wong (1992).

Reference-contexts: This interference property is called crosstalk. (Zhou and Wong 1996). The predominant component of crosstalk between two interconnection wires (nets) is due to their coupling capacitance. <ref> (Gao and Liu 1996) </ref>. This coupling capacitance is easy to approximate: for two parallel wire segments the crosstalk is directly proportional to the coupling length, directly proportional to the frequencies of the signals traveling on the wires, and inversely proportional to the distance of separation between the two segments.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, LISP code will run an entire order of magnitude slower than the equivalent C code. <ref> (Novak 1998) </ref>. This makes for an unpleasantly slow running time. If n is the number of nets to be routed, and r and c the number of rows and columns available on the grid, then one cycle on SNACC will potentially evaluate nrc positions.
