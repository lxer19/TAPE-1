Reference-contexts: following theorem is as good as any known bound: Theorem 2 For N prime there exists a lattice rule Q (z) of the form (3.5) such that P ff (Q (z)) N N 1 2 (1 N 1ff )(ff) ! d An analogous result for composite N is given in <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This result indicates on impressive rate of convergence for large N , but asymptotic bounds of this kind either do not give explicit values of c (ff; d); or do not provide useful bounds for smaller values of N . Among the known explicit bounds, the authors of <ref> [2] </ref> assert that for prime values of N up to approximately 10 d the bound in the following theorem is as good as any known bound: Theorem 2 For N prime there exists a lattice rule Q (z) of the form (3.5) such that P ff (Q (z)) N N 1

Reference-contexts: well chosen integer vector, with no nontrivial factor in common with N , and fxg for x 2 R d means that each component of x is to be replaced by its fractional part in [0; 1): The classical theorems of the method of good lattice points (see, for example, <ref> [3] </ref> or [4]) assert the existence of z = z (N ) such that P ff (Q (z)) c (ff; d) N ff ; for some positive functions c and fi. Usually, fi (ff; d) is of order d.

Reference-contexts: The bound on N is sharp, since the error of a quadrature rule that uses N = 2 d may be arbitrarily small for large ff. The space E ff;d is a standard setting for the particular class of quadrature formulas known as lattice rules (for a survey see <ref> [4] </ref>). <p> integer vector, with no nontrivial factor in common with N , and fxg for x 2 R d means that each component of x is to be replaced by its fractional part in [0; 1): The classical theorems of the method of good lattice points (see, for example, [3] or <ref> [4] </ref>) assert the existence of z = z (N ) such that P ff (Q (z)) c (ff; d) N ff ; for some positive functions c and fi.

Reference-contexts: Since the class E ff;d is convex and symmetric (i.e., f 2 E ff;d implies that f 2 E ff;d ) we may apply Smolyak's theorem, see e.g., <ref> [6] </ref> p. 76. This theorem states that the mapping which minimizes the worst-case error is linear. For linear we have just proven that the error is at least one. We may also permit adaptive choice of points t j . <p> By Bakhvalov's theorem, see e.g., <ref> [6] </ref>, p. 59, the worst-case error of arbitrary quadrature rule that uses adaptive points t j cannot be smaller than the minimal worst-case error of linear quadrature rules that use nonadaptive (fixed) points. Again the latter error is at least one.
