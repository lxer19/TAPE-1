Abstract: We present new methods for scan chain ordering under the minimum wirelength objective. We have adapted the standard 2-opt and 3-opt heuristics for the symmetric traveling salesman problem (TSP) to scan chain ordering, which can be formulated as an asymmetric TSP. We show that our method is superior to a previous approach, which transformed the scan chain problem so that symmetric TSP heuristics could be applied directly. Our implementation is very efficient, requiring only O(n 2 ) time, and allows a number of user-specified options, including grouping of scan cells, priority assignment, and a preferred wiring direction. We also present an new optimal scan chain algorithm for the special case when one wiring direction is infinitely preferred over the other (for example, if feedthroughs must be minimized). This algorithm is based on dynamic programming and can also be implemented in O(n 2 ) time.

Reference-contexts: Later studies include a very comprehensive empirical comparison of symmetric TSP heuristics by Johnson [6]. Since Johnson's study, works by Bentley <ref> [2] </ref> and Reinelt [14] have suggested ways to reduce the running times of the more successful heuristics, while Martin et al. [11] have given an extension to earlier heuristics that improves the quality of the returned tour while increasing running times. <p> The move is equivalent to swapping the positions of two subtours. replaced by edges AD and BC. In part (b), we represent the tour as a path starting at A and show how the 2-opt move can be executed by reversing a single subtour (from D to B). Bentley <ref> [2] </ref> describes efficient implementations for 2-Opt and 3-Opt using a complicated data structure called a K-d tree. Our implementation avoids using K-d trees; instead we apply the method suggested by Reinelt [14] to restrict ourselves to only O (n) candidate edges for the tour.

Reference-contexts: We note that the more recent literature on scan chain ordering has concentrated on a very different objective: that of minimizing the number of cycles required during testing. Research on this objective includes papers by Diwan [4], by Cheng, Devadas and Keutzer <ref> [3] </ref> and by Narayanan, Njinda and Breuer [13]. However, since chip performance is still a dominant concern, minimizing scan chain wirelength is still an essential objective. The remainder of our paper is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: We first apply modifications of two well-known heuristics for the symmetric traveling salesman problem (TSP). 1 We then present a new optimal algorithm based on dynamic programming for the special case of a preferred wiring direction. Feuer and Koo <ref> [5] </ref> wrote perhaps the first published work to show how TSP heuristics can be applied to scan chain optimization. They translate a given scan chain instance into a symmetric TSP instance, allowing TSP heuristics to be used without modification.

Reference-contexts: Although the TSP is known to be NP-Complete [7], a number of efficient heuristics have been developed that give solutions within a few percentage points of optimal in practice <ref> [6] </ref>. The goal of the TSP is to construct a "tour" of minimum length over a set of "cities", starting and ending at one city and visiting each of the other cities exactly once. <p> Later studies include a very comprehensive empirical comparison of symmetric TSP heuristics by Johnson <ref> [6] </ref>. Since Johnson's study, works by Bentley [2] and Reinelt [14] have suggested ways to reduce the running times of the more successful heuristics, while Martin et al. [11] have given an extension to earlier heuristics that improves the quality of the returned tour while increasing running times. <p> approach will be to modify symmetric TSP heuristics to scan chain optimization. 1 The asymmetry of the problem is magnified if connections between certain registers are "fixed" by the designer, thereby increasing the distance between the scan-in and scan-out pins of a "city". 4 2.5 Heuristics for Symmetric TSPs Johnson <ref> [6] </ref> has compiled a comprehensive empirical comparison of heuristics for the symmetric TSP. The heuristics with the best solution qualities and running times are the 2-Opt, 3-Opt, and Lin-Kernighan [9] algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The heuristics with the best solution qualities and running times are the 2-Opt, 3-Opt, and Lin-Kernighan <ref> [9] </ref> algorithms. All three of these algorithms apply the global optimization strategy of iterative greed or local optimization, which iteratively constructs a new solution s i+1 from the previous solution s i by making "local" changes to s i . <p> For each edge e, a constant-time search is required to check whether e is the first edge in a successful 3-Opt or 2-Opt move. Using what we call the "gain" method of Lin and Kernighan <ref> [9] </ref> we can greatly restrict the amount of time spent at each candidate first edge. The gain method applies to 2-Opt in the following way.
