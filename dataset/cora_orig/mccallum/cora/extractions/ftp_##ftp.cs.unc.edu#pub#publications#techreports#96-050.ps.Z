Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction PCSIM was developed as part of a simulation environment to support research in the properties of sinusoidal salphasic clock signal propagation <ref> [5] </ref>. Since lossiness is a critical factor in salphasic behavior, one of the requirements was an accurate representation of losses in both the dielectric and the conductors, including a proper accounting for skin effect.
