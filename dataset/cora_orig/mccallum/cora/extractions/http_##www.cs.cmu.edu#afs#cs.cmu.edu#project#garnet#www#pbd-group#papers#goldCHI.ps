Abstract: The problem is particularly difficult when there are mul tiple data values that need to be displayed in the same or ``Gold'' is a new interactive editor that allows a user to linked graphs. Imagine trying to specify a display like draw examples of the desired picture for business graphics figure 1 using the conventional techniques. Also, there is and the system automatically produces a visualization. To evidence that when users construct their own visualiza-specify a custom visualization in other systems, code must tions, they understand the data better than when a visualiza-be written or a bewildering array of dialog boxes and com- tion is produced for them [19]. Furthermore, a single dis-mands must be used. In Gold, as the user is drawing an play is often insufficient, and users need to explore the data example of the desired visualization, knowledge of by changing display types, zooming, rescaling and ag-properties of the data and the typical graphics in business gregating data. charts are used to generalize the example and create a picture for the actual data. The goal is to make designing a To solve these problems, we are building an interactive complex, composite chart almost as easy as sketching a drawing editor called ``Gold'' which allows the user to picture on a napkin. user change a display using similar techniques. This will When users want a chart or graph of their data in personal make it easier to edit the display and explore the data. computer programs like Lotus 1-2-3, Microsoft Excel, or Unlike simple drawing tools like MacDraw, the user only DeltaGraph Professional [4], they select the range of data, needs to draw an example of one or two data elements, and the system will use some simple heuristics to automati- which do not have to even be the correct sizes, and Gold cally display the data in a chart. Alternatively, the user can automatically will draw the rest. Furthermore, if the data select from a menu of pre-defined chart types. However, if changes, the system automatically updates the picture. the system does not choose correctly, and the built-in charts are not appropriate, then it is quite difficult for users to Gold will support almost all the kinds of two-dimensional specify the desired pictures. Typically, many complex charts provided by Excel, DeltaGraph [4] and similar dialog boxes and commands must be used. This is a sig- programs, including (in the terminology of DeltaGraph): nificant recognized problem with all of these programs, column charts, stacked column charts, bar charts, stacked which so far has not been solved. In fact, users of bar charts, line charts, pie charts, area charts, scatter charts, Microsoft Excel found this process so difficult that the high-low charts, and range charts. Of course, given the Windows version provides a so-called ``Wizard'' interface, system's demonstrational nature, the user does not need to that takes the user through a set of question-and-answer know what these names refer to, and can instead draw a dialogs. However, this can be tedious and still does not picture. Furthermore, Gold's real power will come from provide the user with sufficient flexibility to easily specify making it easy to express combinations of different charts, desired displays. Creating custom displays is also difficult and controlling the parameterization of properties of with scientific visualization systems like the IBM charts, for showing relationships among multiple data sets Visualization Data Explorer. In these, code must be writ- (as in figure 1). This means that with Gold, the user can ten, either using conventional or visual programming lan- create charts (such as Myers-Color-Plate-3) that are not guages. Data and scientific visualization are very active areas of research with a number of conferences and journals devoted to them. However, it appears that most research is directed at new kinds of visualizations. Our research, however, is aimed at making fairly conventional visualiza-tions much easier to produce. even possible with tools such as Excel and DeltaGraph.
