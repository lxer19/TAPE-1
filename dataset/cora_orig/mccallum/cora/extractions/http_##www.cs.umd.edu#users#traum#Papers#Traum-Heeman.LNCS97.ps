Abstract: In order to make spoken dialogue systems more sophisticated, designers need to better understand the conventions that people use in structuring their speech and in interacting with their fellow conversants. In particular, it is crucial to discriminate the basic building blocks of dialogue and how they affect the way people process language. Many researchers have proposed the utterance unit as the primary object of study, but defining exactly what this is has remained a difficult issue. To shed light on this question, we consider grounding behavior in dialogue, and examine co-occurrences between turn-initial grounding acts and utterance unit boundary signals that have been proposed in the literature, namely prosodic boundary tones and pauses. Preliminary results indicate high correlation between grounding and boundary tones, with a secondary correlation for longer pauses. We also consider some of the dialogue processing issues which are impacted by a definition of utterance unit.

Reference-contexts: But just what are utterances? How are they built up from more primitive bits of speech, and how do they cohere with other utterances by both the same and other speakers? Following Bloomfield <ref> [2] </ref>, the term utterance has often been vaguely defined as an act of speech. The problem is that action comes in many different types and sizes.

According to the view of conversation as a collaborative process, inspired by Clark <ref> [4] </ref>, the conversants are not just making individual contributions, but working together to augment their common ground. This process of grounding involves specifically acknowledging the installments of others.

Reference-contexts: mechanism for flexibly coordinating the contributions of the conversants to reach a mutual understanding of what has been said. 4 Grounding and Relatedness As our method for checking the adequacy of proposed utterance unit boundaries, we consider the phenomenon of grounding: the process of adding to common ground between conversants <ref> [5] </ref>. Clark and Schaefer present a model of grounding in conversation, in which contributions are composed of two phases, presentations and acceptances. In the presentation phase, the first speaker specifies the content of his contribution and the partners try to register that content.

Reference-contexts: We describe some of the needs for a precise utterance unit definition in Section 3. Analysts have proposed many different definitions of utterances and utterance units. The turn is the unit of dialogue that has most often been proposed for study as a basic utterance unit. Fries <ref> [8] </ref>, for example, uses the term utterance unit to denote those chunks of talk that are marked off by a shift of speaker. Other definitions are based on a variety of information, including syntactic (sentence, clause), semantic/pragmatic (a single proposition or speech act), or prosodic (tunes, stress, silence). <p> Speech by a single speaker, speaking without interruption by speech of the other, constituting a single Turn (e.g. <ref> [7, 8, 22, 27] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For the overlap cases, we looked for a boundary tone on the last complete word before the overlapping speech occurred. The distribution of the overlaps into tone and no-tone categories is still somewhat problematic, due to the potential projectability of IP boundaries <ref> [10] </ref>: a new speaker may judge that the end of a unit is coming up and merely anticipate (perhaps incorrectly) the occurrence of a tone.

Reference-contexts: Acknowledgment acts include three types, explicit acknowledgments which are one of the feedback words, whether they appeared as a backchannel or not, paraphrases of material presented by the other speaker, and implicit acknowledgments, which display understanding through conditional relevance.

Reference-contexts: When people speak, they tend not to speak in a monotone.

Reference-contexts: Also, oftentimes the speaker's pitch level will continue at the same level before and after the pause. There is also often some silence around the point of disfluency during a speech repair. There have also been some more radical proposals for smaller basic units. For example, Poesio <ref> [26] </ref> proposed that each word or morpheme be a basic unit, accessible to all aspects of the discourse processing, including semantics, reference resolution, and dialogue management. <p> For one thing, the basic decision of when and how to respond to input from a user can be informed by awareness of utterance units. Even if full discourse processing of language proceeds within an utterance unit, as suggested by <ref> [26] </ref>, the decision of when to respond still mainly follows regular patterns, occurring at regular places [27]. Awareness of the markers for turn-endings and TRPs can help with the decision of when to respond and when to wait for further input.

Reference-contexts: Speech by a single speaker, speaking without interruption by speech of the other, constituting a single Turn (e.g. <ref> [7, 8, 22, 27] </ref>. Has syntactic and/or semantic completion (e.g. [7, 22, 21, 32]). Defines a single speech act (e.g. [22, 16, 20]). Is an intonational phrase (e.g. [12, 9, 7, 11]). Separated by a pause (e.g. [22, 11, 29, 33]). <p> Instead, they use moves and acts as the basic single-speaker components of exchanges. A single turn might consist of several different moves, each of which might be part of different exchanges. Sacks et. al, <ref> [27] </ref> present a theory of the organization of turns as composed of smaller turn-constructional units (TCUs). <p> Even if full discourse processing of language proceeds within an utterance unit, as suggested by [26], the decision of when to respond still mainly follows regular patterns, occurring at regular places <ref> [27] </ref>. Awareness of the markers for turn-endings and TRPs can help with the decision of when to respond and when to wait for further input. More importantly, the nature of the previous utterance unit can be a good signal of how to respond.

Reference-contexts: This can be a demonstration style acknowledgment (i.e., repetition or paraphrase of a previous utterance by the other speaker), a repair or repair request, or some kind of continuation. Any second part to an adjacency pair <ref> [28] </ref> (such as an answer to a question, or the acceptance or rejection of a proposal) fits in this category.

Reference-contexts: From a purely functional point of view, many analysts have also found the turn too large a unit for convenient analysis. Fries, for example, noted that his utterance units could contain multiple sentences. Sinclair and Coulthard <ref> [31] </ref>, found that their basic unit of interaction, the exchange, cut across individual turns. Instead, they use moves and acts as the basic single-speaker components of exchanges. A single turn might consist of several different moves, each of which might be part of different exchanges. <p> As an example, the theory of Sinclair and Coulthard <ref> [31] </ref> is composed of hierarchical ranks of action, some of which occur across speaker turns, and some of which occur within the turn of a single speaker. The notion of an utterance unit could be useful in isolating which span of speech encapsulates a particular rank of action.

Reference-contexts: This position has some attractions because there is psycholinguistic evidence that people do in fact use context even at such basic levels and are able to act appropriately (e.g., by gazing at an object) as soon as the necessary words to disambiguate the meaning are heard <ref> [34] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: These include feedback words such as ok, right, and mm-hm, repetition of the previous content, and initiation of a next relevant contribution. Completions and repairs of presentations of the contributor also play a role in the grounding process. Traum and Allen <ref> [35] </ref> built on this work, presenting a speech acts approach to grounding, in which utterances are seen as actions affecting the state of grounding of contributed material. <p> We thus use a less detailed labeling of utterances than that of <ref> [35] </ref>, with a slightly different focus. We lump the repair, request for repair, and the paraphrase and implicit categories of acknowledgment together into one category we call related. <p> These results give strong evidence of grounding behavior at turn transitions. Fully 80% of utterance display grounding behavior, while another 15% occur in positions in which (according to the theory of <ref> [35, 36] </ref>) further grounding is unnecessary. It is only in 3-5% of turn transitions in which a lack of orientation to the contributions of the other speaker is displayed.

Reference-contexts: The notion of an utterance unit could be useful in isolating which span of speech encapsulates a particular rank of action. Also, the multi-level conversation act theory proposed in <ref> [36] </ref> used an utterance unit distinction. In that proposal, turn-taking acts occurred within utterance units, grounding acts (see Section 4) occurred at the utterance unit level, and traditional core speech acts were composed of multiple utterance units. <p> Obviously, for such a theory, the nature of an utterance unit will affect how some acts are classified. For example, the set of grounding acts from <ref> [36] </ref> included acts for repair and continue functions. Trivially, smaller utterance units would lead to more continue acts, but consider the case in which a repair (e.g., a speech repair) occurs within an utterance unit. <p> These results give strong evidence of grounding behavior at turn transitions. Fully 80% of utterance display grounding behavior, while another 15% occur in positions in which (according to the theory of <ref> [35, 36] </ref>) further grounding is unnecessary. It is only in 3-5% of turn transitions in which a lack of orientation to the contributions of the other speaker is displayed.
