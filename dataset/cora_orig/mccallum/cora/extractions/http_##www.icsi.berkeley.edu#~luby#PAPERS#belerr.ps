Abstract: We construct new families of low-density parity-check codes, which we call irregular codes. When decoded using belief propagation, our codes can correct more errors than previously known low-density codes. Our improved performance comes from using codes based on irregular random bipartite graphs, based on the work of [2]. Previously studied low-density codes have been derived from regular bipartite graphs. Initial experimental results for our irregular codes suggest that, with improvements, irregular codes may be able to match turbo code performance.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, because belief propagation is not yet well understood mathematically, creating the proper irregular graphs appears a daunting challenge. We meet this challenge by using irregular graphs that have been proven to be effective for erasure codes that function in a similar manner <ref> [2] </ref>. In the area of erasure codes, the mathematical framework has been established to both design irregular graphs and prove their effectiveness. We provide an example of the irregular graphs used in Table 1.
