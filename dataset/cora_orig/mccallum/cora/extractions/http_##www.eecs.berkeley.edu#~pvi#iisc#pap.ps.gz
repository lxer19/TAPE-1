Title: On the Stability of Fuzzy Systems  
Author: M A L Thathachar Fellow IEEE Pramod Viswanath 
Abstract: This paper studies the global asymptotic stability of a class of fuzzy systems. It demonstrates the equivalence of stability properties of fuzzy systems and LTI switching systems. A necessary condition and a sufficient condition for the stability of such systems are given and it is shown that under the sufficient condition, a common Lyapunov function exists for the LTI sub-systems. A particular case when the system matrices can be simultaneously transformed to normal matrices is shown to correspond to the existence of a common quadratic Lyapunov function. A constructive procedure to check the possibility of simultaneous transformation to normal matrices is provided. Key Words: Asymptotic Stability, Fuzzy Systems, Switching systems, Normal matrices, Common Lyapunov function

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently, fuzzy control is being used in many practical industrial applications. One of the first questions to be answered in this context is the stability of the fuzzy system. In recent literature, Tanaka and Sugeno <ref> [3] </ref>, have provided a sufficient condition for the asymptotic stability of a fuzzy system in the sense of Lyapunov through the existence of a common Lyapunov function for all the subsystems. Tanaka and Sano [4] have extended this to robust stability in case of systems with premise parameter uncertainty. <p> Comment 2 : Also the result expressed in Theorem 4.3 of <ref> [3] </ref>, a necessary condition for stability that the matrices be pairwise stable is evident as a special case of Theorem 3.3 in which (A 2 ) is considered. 4 A Sufficient Condition for Stability The following Theorem 4.1 provides a sufficient condition for stability of (3). <p> Hence the matrices are simultaneously diagonalizable. 6 Conclusions Stability of the Sugeno-Takagi model [2] of a fuzzy system has been considered in the asymptotic sense. A necessary condition for the global asymptotic stability which generalizes a result reported in <ref> [3] </ref> is given. A sufficient condition is also provided here for the global asymptotic stability of the system. A particular case of this sufficient condition, simultaneous normalization of the system matrices, is considered and a constructive procedure to check for simultaneous normalization is developed.

Reference-contexts: A matrix A is said to be normalizable if there exists nonsingular S such that S 1 AS is normal . From <ref> [5] </ref>, S is necessarily of the form S = T A U where T A is a modal matrix of A and U is a Unitary matrix. Let N A = S 1 AS : S = T A U ; U unitary . <p> Also M A M T A = M T A M A = I. From Theorem 4 and Corollary 1 in <ref> [5] </ref> we have Theorem 5.2 Let A and B be two normalizable matrices. Then they are simultaneously normalizable iff T A T fl A = B . <p> The procedure of verifying the satisfiability of Theorem 5.1 is summarized below in two steps. Step 1 checks for pairwise normalization of the matrices as in <ref> [5] </ref> and Step 2 which is carried out upon the success of Step 1, checks for additional constraints on the similarity transformations S ij so that simultaneous normalization of the matrices is achieved: Step 1 The matrices A i ; i = 1 : : : N are checked for pairwise <p> This is done as in <ref> [5] </ref>. The conditions for pairwise normalization of two matrices, say, A l 1 and A l 2 is exposited below.

Reference-contexts: The classical theory of LTV systems is discussed in Section 9 of [8] and recent advances in LTV systems are in [9]. Narendra and Balakrishnan <ref> [6] </ref> have provided a simple sufficient condition for the stability of the switching system. This paper discusses some necessary and some sufficient conditions for global asymptotic stability of a fuzzy system. <p> In this case the sub-systems have a common quadratic Lyapunov function. Also, a constructional procedure is provided to check whether the theorem's premise is satisfied. An example illustrates the procedure. This result can be viewed as a generalisation of the result in <ref> [6] </ref>, a sufficient condition for stability of switching systems. 2 Notations and Definitions This section outlines the mathematical model of a free fuzzy system and that of the corresponding switching system. Stability of these systems in the asymptotic sense is also defined. <p> Thus the matrices are simultaneously nor-malizable and hence the corresponding switching system is stable. Comment 4 : Simultaneous normalization can be thought of as an extension of simultaneous diagonalization of the matrices since diagonal matrices are normal. This case has been studied in <ref> [6] </ref> as a class of commuting matrices and the proof there proceeds by actually constructing a commonLyapunov matrix. We show that this result follows naturally in our framework of simultaneously normalizable matrices. <p> We show that this result follows naturally in our framework of simultaneously normalizable matrices. This ties the circle of ideas of demonstrating stability by showing the existence of or by actually constructing a common quadratic Lyapunov function for the matrices in A. Theorem 5.5 <ref> [6] </ref> If the matrices A i ; i = 1 : : : N commute pairwise, then the switching system (3) is stable. Proof Let the matrices A 1 ; A 2 ; : : : A N commute pairwise.
