Abstract: In this note we propose two algorithms to compute truncated pivoted QR approximations to a sparse matrix. One is based on the Gram-Schmidt algorithm, and the other on Householder triangularization. Both algorithms leave the original matrix unchanged, and the only additional storage requirements are arrays to contain the factorization itself. Thus, the algorithms are particularly suited to determining low-rank approximations to a sparse ma trix. fl This report is available by anonymous ftp from thales.cs.umd.edu in the directory pub/reports or on the web at http://www.cs.umd.edu/ stewart/. y Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Mary-land, College Park, MD 20742.

Reference-contexts: This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant CCR-95-03126. 1 Since the purpose of this note is to describe rearrangements of two standard algorithms, we assume that the reader is familiar with the basics, which are covered in an excellent book by A. Bjorck <ref> [1] </ref> 2 In the partitions to follow we use northwest indexing, in which each block has the index of the element in the northwest corner. 1 2 Computing truncated pivoted QR decompositions where R 11 is of order k, then ^ X = Q 11 (R 11 R 1;k+1 ) T <p> The cure for this problem is a process in which q k is reorthogonalized against the previous q j . The details of this process, which also alters the kth columns of R have been well treated in <ref> [1] </ref>, and we omit them. until the projected columns norms, which correspond to the norms of the columns of R k+1;k+1 in (1), become sufficiently small, at which point the process terminate with the rank k approximation ^ X = Q [:; 1:k]flR [1:k; 1:p].

Reference-contexts: Thus there is no need to transform the entire matrix X. These ideas are best implemented using an elegant representation for the product of Householder transformations due to Schreiber and Van Loan <ref> [2] </ref>.
