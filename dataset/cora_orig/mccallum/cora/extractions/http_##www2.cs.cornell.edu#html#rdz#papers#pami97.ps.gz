Title: A Non-Parametric Approach to Visual Correspondence  
Author: Ramin Zabih John Woodfill 
Note: Interval Research Corporation Submitted to IEEE PAMI  
Affiliation: Computer Science Department Cornell University  
Abstract: We describe a method for computing visual correspondence based on the local ordering of intensities. Ordering information is robust to outliers and invariant to monotonic intensity distortions such as image gain. Our approach is based on non-parametric measures of association but also accounts for the spatial variation of disparities. We describe some of the mathematical properties of our algorithms, and demonstrate their utility on both synthetic and real imagery with ground truth. These methods are extremely efficient, and have been used for video-rate stereo and motion.

Reference-contexts: As a consequence, our solution performs correctly on examples like figure 1. Our algorithm is extremely efficient, and has been used for real-time applications. We begin by describing the correspondence problem and reviewing some related work. Many solutions <ref> [1, 3, 15] </ref> use robust statistics to tolerate outliers, but lack spatial information.

Such methods have been used for a variety of problems in computer vision <ref> [1, 15] </ref>, including motion [3]. There are two limitations of robust methods: first, they do not use spatial information about the variation of disparity; and second, they have non-trivial computational cost if the images are affected by gain or bias. We will consider each of these issues in turn.

Reference-contexts: The rank of a pixel in an image is the number of nearby pixels with lower intensities. Bhat and Nayar <ref> [2] </ref> have recently argued for the use of ordering information to compute correspondence. Many of their arguments are similar to ones we presented earlier in [24, 25]. Their approach uses a robust method to compare permutations, instead of the L 2 distance on ranks used by Spearman.

They are fundamentally regression methods, i.e. algorithms for fitting a model to data. When robust statistics is applied to the correspondence problem <ref> [3] </ref>, the data to be fitted consists of intensity pairs, where each pair contains one intensity from I 1 and one from I 2 . The spatial relationship between pixels is discarded in this formulation, and all pixels in a window are treated uniformly.

Reference-contexts: Intermediate gray values are erroneous. natural standard to compare against, because it is easy to implement and generally performs well. For example, the SRI JISCT stereo evaluation <ref> [4] </ref> found that normalized correlation performed about as well as any of the methods they considered. On both synthetic and real data with ground truth, our methods significantly out-perform normalized correlation.

Reference-contexts: If the two images are temporally consecutive, then computing correspondence determines motion. If the two images are spatially separated but simultaneous, then computing correspondence determines stereo depth. Area-based approaches to the correspondence problem <ref> [5] </ref> find a dense solution, typically using some kind of statistical correlation between local intensity windows. Locations where disparity changes abruptly, called discontinuities, are a major challenge for correspondence methods. At a discontinuity, pixels in the window come from more than one disparity.

Reference-contexts: Images are subject to other distortions beyond gaussian noise, which complicates the correspondence problem. Corresponding pixels are often affected by multiplicative and additive distortions, called gain and bias. Bias can be removed by pre-filtering with a laplacian <ref> [6] </ref>, at the cost of losing some image detail; however, gain cannot be removed by any linear operation. In addition, images are distorted by effects which cannot be modeled without significant prior information.

Reference-contexts: Statisticians call such methods measures of association on paired data; a standard example is Pearson's r. Correlation using r, often called normalized correlation, has been used for stereo for over two decades <ref> [8] </ref>. Images are subject to other distortions beyond gaussian noise, which complicates the correspondence problem. Corresponding pixels are often affected by multiplicative and additive distortions, called gain and bias.

Reference-contexts: Robust methods are very efficient when there is no image gain or bias, but gain or bias are common. M-estimation can be used in the presence of image gain or bias, but this requires iterative numerical methods such as Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares <ref> [10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The Central Limit Theorem implies that the convolution of a sequence of boxes will result in a normal distribution (this fact can be exploited to efficiently smooth images <ref> [22] </ref>). Therefore, the number of secondary comparisons is very approximately normal. The function Inf is thus the sum of two functions, one of which (the primary comparisons) is a box, and the other of which (the secondary comparisons) is the convolution of two boxes.
