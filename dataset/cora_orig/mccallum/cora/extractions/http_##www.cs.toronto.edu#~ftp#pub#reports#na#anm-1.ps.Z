Abstract: We consider the numerical solution of initial value problems for both ordinary differential equations and differential-algebraic equations by Runge-Kutta (RK) formulas. We assume that the internal stage values of the RK formula are computed by some iterative scheme for solving nonlinear equations, such as Newton's method. Using Butcher series and rooted trees, we give a complete characterization of the local error in the RK formula after k iterations of the scheme. Results are given for three specific schemes: simple iteration, the modified Newton iteration, and the full Newton iteration. The ideas developed in this paper, however, are easily applied to other iterative schemes of this kind.

Reference-contexts: Example 1 We solved the problem y 0 p y 0 2 e x 2 ); y 2 (:1) = e :01 cos (:1); on the interval [0:1; 0:5] with the iterated RK method (4)-(5) based on the underlying eighth-order explicit RK (ERK) formula <ref> [2, p. 208] </ref> together with a third-order ERK formula to compute the starting values fY (0) i g for the iteration. <p> See <ref> [2] </ref> or [6] for a comprehensive introduction to B-series and trees. 6 It is well known that the exact solution of (1) and the numerical solution (2)-(3) can be written as B-series: y (x 0 + h) = B (1; y 0 ); Y = B (; y 0 ); y <p> [t; : : : ; t ]; [t 1 ; : : : ; t m ] : each t i is of the form [t; : : : ; t ]g: Now, to make the emerging pattern more clear, we introduce the height function, H (t), defined by Butcher <ref> [2] </ref> to be 1 plus the length of the longest path in the tree t, or, more formally, H (;) = 0; H (t ) = 1; H (t = [t 1 ; : : : ; t m ]) = 1 + max H (t i ): It follows easily

Reference-contexts: For a variety of formulas and problems, several authors have recently studied the maximum number of iterations needed to preserve the order of the underlying formula (2)-(3). See, for example, Sugiura and Torii [12] for nonstiff problems; Alexander [1], and van Dorsselaer and Spijker <ref> [3] </ref> for stiff systems; and Hairer, Lubich and Roche [5] for differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) of index 1, 2 and 3. See also the earlier work of Liniger [9]. These results are all based on the classical analysis of iterative schemes for systems of nonlinear equations. <p> Expanding upon this outline, we prove Theorem 2 for the modified and full Newton iterations in [10]. However, all the discussion above depends on the classical B-series analysis for ODEs, which is valid in the limit as h ! 0. As pointed out by van Dorsselaer and Spijker <ref> [3] </ref>, for instance, this h ! 0 assumption may not be appropriate for stiff problems. We address this concern in the next section. 4 Differential-Algebraic Equations of Index 1. <p> Van Dorsselaer and Spijker <ref> [3] </ref> give convergence results for Newton-like iterations for ODEs satisfying the contractivity condition ky (x 0 + h) ~y (x 0 + h)k ky (x 0 ) ~y (x 0 )k, where y (x) and ~y (x) are both solutions to the same ODE. <p> More importantly, though, we view the B-series analysis for iterated RK methods as complementing, rather than competing with, other approaches, such as that of van Dorsselaer and Spijker <ref> [3] </ref>, for gaining a better understanding of these methods.

Reference-contexts: To address this potential deficiency, Kvrnt [8] extended the B-series analysis of [10] to semi-explicit DAEs of index 1. In addition to being important in their own right, DAEs may be viewed as the limiting case of a large class of stiff ODEs (as 2 explained in <ref> [4] </ref>).

(29) is of interest not only because problems of this form arise in many important applications, but also because it can be viewed as the limiting case of the IVP associated with the stiff singularly-perturbed ODE y 0 = f (y; z); * ! 0; as described in <ref> [4] </ref>. Thus, by providing results for (29), we hope to meet some of the objections one could make to the application of the theory presented in x3 to stiff ODEs. 12 The B-series analysis of Newton-type iterations for (29) is given by Kvrnt [8].

Reference-contexts: Although we consider in detail only three particular iteration schemes in this paper, we believe that our approach is applicable to other iteration schemes as well. For instance, van der Houwen, Sommeijer and Couzy <ref> [7] </ref> note that there is a parallel computing advantage to taking the Newton iteration matrix to be I hM J (k) , for a carefully chosen diagonal matrix M , rather than the usual I hAJ (k) .

Reference-contexts: In this way, we hope to motivate the use of Butcher series, commonly called B-series, in the analysis of iterative schemes in RK formulas.

We summarize in x4 some of the results of [8]. <p> This is of course true, but several experiments with other RK formulas and other predictors give results similar to those in Example 1, confirming the benefit of high order predictors. In addition, these experimental observations are supported by the following theoretical result which we prove using B-series in <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> Using this approach, we prove Theorem 2 and several related results in <ref> [10] </ref>.

(t) r + 2, t = [t 1 ; : : : ; t m ]: It is now easy to prove by induction on k (see <ref> [10] </ref>) that (k) (t) = (t) and (k) (t) = (t) 8 t 2 LT s.t. <p> As this implies that (8) holds for the simple iteration case of Theorem 2 and we have already seen from (23) that (7) holds in this case too, we have proved Theorem 2 for simple iteration. A similar analysis is given in <ref> [10] </ref> to establish Theorem 2 for the modified and full Newton iterations also. The key to the proof for these and other iteration schemes is to find a recurrence for the B-series for Y (k) similar to (18) and to find relations similar to (22) and (26). <p> The essential property that we require of G (t; r) is that G (t; r) k if and only if (k) (t) depends only on predictor stage weights (0) (t i ) for trees t i satisfying (t i ) r. We show in <ref> [10] </ref> that, for the modified Newton iteration, the growth function is R (t; r), which is roughly speaking equal to 1 plus the maximum number of ramifications along any path from the root of the tree to the first subtree of order r + 1 or less, and, for the full <p> Formal definitions of R (t; r) and D (t; r) are given in <ref> [10] </ref>. The growth function associated with an iterated RK method gives a much more complete description of the convergence of the method than the order alone. <p> Expanding upon this outline, we prove Theorem 2 for the modified and full Newton iterations in <ref> [10] </ref>. However, all the discussion above depends on the classical B-series analysis for ODEs, which is valid in the limit as h ! 0. As pointed out by van Dorsselaer and Spijker [3], for instance, this h ! 0 assumption may not be appropriate for stiff problems.
