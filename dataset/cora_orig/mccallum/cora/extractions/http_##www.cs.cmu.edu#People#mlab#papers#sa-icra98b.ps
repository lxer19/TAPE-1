Abstract: Parts manufactured to tolerances have shape variations. Most work in robotic manipulation assumes that part shape does not vary. Orienting devices such as bowl feeders frequently fail due to variations in part shape. In this paper we develop techniques to orient parts with shape uncertainty. We present a shape uncertainty model and describe the non-determinism in parts orienting that arises from shape uncertainty. We characterize a class of parts that can be reliably oriented with sensor-based and sensorless orienting plans under shape uncertainty. We present implemented planners that generate orienting plans for the entire variational class of part shapes given a nominal part shape and shape uncertainty bounds. We describe experiments to demonstrate generated plans and outline issues for future work.

Reference-contexts: We describe sensor-based and sensorless planning and characterize planner properties. We outline a planner for parts whose set of stable edges may change due to shape uncertainty. We present experimental results and conclude with a discussion of future work. This paper summarizes work presented in (Akella <ref> [1] </ref>). 2 Related Work The need to manufacture parts specified by tolerances arose with mass production methods that required interchangeable parts. Voelcker [20] surveys the area of toleranc-ing and describes the trend towards mathematically based tolerancing standards. <p> It is also related to AND/OR search based planning for sensor-based manipulation (Taylor et al. [19]) and sensor-based orienting of multiple parts by parallel-jaw grasping (Rao and Goldberg [17]). 3 Orienting Parts with Known Shape We summarize our previous work on orienting parts with known shape (Akella <ref> [1] </ref>; Akella and Mason [3]) to provide the necessary background. We use sensors that provide partial information on part orientation along with mechanical operations to generate orienting plans. <p> Variations in the center of mass location. Computing the exact center of mass uncertainty locus for a part with shape uncertainty assuming uniform mass density is an open problem. See (Akella <ref> [1] </ref>) for a discussion on bounding the center of mass locus with a circle. 5. Variations in the set of stable edges. <p> For a part with n edges, we can compute conservative approximations of these regions for an edge in O (n) time using region intersection and union operations as de scribed in (Akella <ref> [1] </ref>). Point-inclusion tests (Preparata and Shamos [16]) can determine in O (n) time the stability regions the nominal center of mass belongs to and classify an edge as always stable, always unstable, or sometimes-stable. <p> Representative actions for the set of states are selected from each of these overlap ranges. 5.2 Planning and Plan Existence We generate plans that minimize worst-case length by breadth-first AND/OR search (Akella <ref> [1] </ref>). We compute and apply representative actions for each indistinguishable set encountered during the search process. If a plan exists, it is guaranteed to work for any instance of the part since it works under the most extreme combination of center of mass, vertex, and edge placements. <p> The computed center of mass locus also influences the accuracy of the action ranges. We have assumed the center of mass locus is a circle, when in fact it may not be a circle (Akella <ref> [1] </ref>). The circumscribing circle we use may be an overly conservative approximation of the true locus. These two sources of inaccuracy in the action ranges suggest the sensor-based planner may not be complete. A generated plan is guaranteed to orient any instance of the part.

Reference-contexts: Any part with at least one stable edge with a unique diameter value can always be oriented. To see this, note that it is sufficient to bring the part to the stable edge with the unique diameter to orient it. A randomized plan (Erdmann <ref> [10] </ref>) can repeatedly choose random rotations of the part until it comes when r v and r c are 0.4 mm. Nodes contain indistinguishable states and each set of arrows linked by an arc represents a push-align operation. Shaded goal nodes have a single state. <p> Such plans, similar to Donald's [9] error detection and recovery plans, can potentially handle larger values of shape uncertainty and a broader class of parts, and may even be used as metrological tools to identify parts that do not meet tolerance specifications. Randomized strategies (Erdmann <ref> [10] </ref>) can be effective in handling the nondeterminism when some states have distinct sensor values. We can also use manufacturing process knowledge to estimate the shape uncertainty parameters and generate plans that minimize the expected execution length.

Reference-contexts: Given a nominal part shape and shape uncertainty bounds, we wish to generate orienting plans for the variational class of parts. Part shape critically influences the orientability of parts (e.g., Goldberg <ref> [11] </ref>; Caine [6]; Akella and Mason [3]). The challenge of part shape uncertainty is to find plans that orient the infinite set of part shapes that are valid instances of a given variational class. The main results of this paper are: 1. <p> They use Chen and Ierardi's ([8]) algorithm to generate sensorless plans for a class of polygons. They also compute the maximum uncertainty disk radius for which a plan exists. Our work relies on previous results on the mechanics and planning of pushing and grasping operations (Mason [15], Goldberg <ref> [11] </ref>). <p> The sensor measures the part diameter after alignment to distinguish the orientations. Orienting a part means identifying the part edge aligned against the fence. When a part on the moving conveyor contacts the fence, it is pushed normal to the fence face. The radius function (Goldberg <ref> [11] </ref>) predicts the part rotation due to such a linear normal push. The radius function of a polygon is a mapping from the orientation of a supporting line of the polygon to the perpendicular distance r from the polygon center of mass to the supporting line. <p> See Figure 11 for an example plan. For a single qualitative shape, the set of stable edges is constant and only the size of the resting ranges changes. This suggests that a polynomial-time algorithm (Goldberg <ref> [11] </ref>) can generate sensorless orienting plans with shape uncertainty. 7 Are the Planners Complete? We first address completeness of the sensor-based planner. <p> We demonstrated that it is possible to generate reliable sensor-based and sensorless orienting plans in the presence of shape uncertainty and characterized a class of parts that can be oriented under shape uncertainty. A similar approach can be applied to other tasks such as orienting by parallel-jaw grasping (Goldberg <ref> [11] </ref>; Rao and Goldberg [17]) and orienting with actuated fences (Akella et al. [2]). Future work in orienting parts with shape uncertainty includes analyzing a broader class of parts and developing shape uncertainty models that faithfully capture variations in manufactured parts.

Reference-contexts: We study the effects of uncertainty in part shape on orienting and identify conditions under which we can generate orienting plans for parts with shape uncertainty. The variations in the shape of a part are characterized by the part's nominal shape and shape uncertainty bounds. The variational class (Requicha <ref> [18] </ref>) of parts for a nominal part shape under a given model of shape uncertainty is the class of all part shapes that satisfy the shape uncertainty bounds. Given a nominal part shape and shape uncertainty bounds, we wish to generate orienting plans for the variational class of parts. <p> This paper summarizes work presented in (Akella [1]). 2 Related Work The need to manufacture parts specified by tolerances arose with mass production methods that required interchangeable parts.
