Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive protocol for packet-level forward error correction in dynamic networks. The objective is to facilitate end-to-end transport|i.e., without special network support|of real-time traffic whose timing constraints rule out the use of retransmission-based congestion control and quality of service (QoS) provision schemes. The degree of redundancy injected into the network is adjusted as a function of network state, decreasing when the network is well-behaved and increasing when it is not. The control problem is nontrivial due to the fact that increased redundancy, beyond a certain point, can backfire resulting in self-induced congestion which impedes the timely recovery of information at the receiver. In the first part of the paper, we give a comprehensive analysis of the control problem associated with adaptive forward error correction, concentrating on the dynamics of a particular protocol called Adaptive Forward Error Correction (AFEC). We show that instabilities can arise from two distinct sources|the desired operating point and network delay|and we give solutions to handle them. The first factor, which plays the role of optimal operating point, is directly determined by the stringency of the application's QoS requirements, making its achievement potentially perilous. The second part of the paper presents experimentation and simulation results|the former in the context of an AFEC implementation for transporting real-time MPEG video|that confirm the qualitative dynamics predicted by the analysis. We study the efficacy of AFEC under structural perturbations and bursty traffic conditions including self-similarity, and show under what conditions AFEC is effective. We quantitatively estimate the redundancy-recovery rate function which relates redundancy to the QoS rendered at the receiver. We show that the curve's shape is, in general, unimodal and its curvature is determined by whether a connection is packet loss or delay dominated.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Forward error correction (FEC) is a well-studied reliable communication technique which has been successfully used, primarily at the bit-level, in a number of application domains from space communication to reliable data storage on compact disks <ref> [3, 32, 33] </ref>. The idea of FEC is simple: given a communication channel with known error probabilities, use error correcting codes to inject redundant information into the transmission such that a desired recovery rate|i.e., probability of successful decoding at the receiver of code blocks|is achieved.

Due to the low bit error rates associated with modern communication media, the assumption is made that decoding is mainly impeded by packet loss|i.e., erasures |caused by network congestion and the resultant buffer overflow and queueing delay.

Reference-contexts: Lastly, AFEC is a purely end-to-end QoS provision scheme and, as such, is well-suited to the current Internet environment|at least in the interim during which new architectures are being discussed|which has been dominated by an end-to-end paradigm <ref> [13] </ref>. Since AFEC|and systems built on top of AFEC such as MAFEC|are intended to be used 31 in the current Internet environment, it is worthwhile explicating how the protocol|as a member of a family of operational protocols including TCP|fits into the overall picture from a system perspective.

Reference-contexts: Right: Corresponding packet loss rates. conditions of the cross (or background) traffic. The self-similar background traffic was obtained by multiplexing several traffic streams with heavy-tailed ON/OFF times which is known to yield self-similar traffic series with varying LRD depending on the degree of heavy-tailedness <ref> [60] </ref>. The mean traffic intensity was held constant to achieve comparability such that performance difference is solely attributable to traffic variability 6 . <p> The state-of-the-art in guaranteed QoS provision schemes relies on the paradigm of overprovi-sioning [15, 16, 20, 21, 24, 36, 43, 46, 47, 17] which uses traffic shaping and GPS-based schedulers to assure stringent QoS quarantees. However, the scale-invariant burstiness associated with self-similar network traffic <ref> [37, 53, 60, 48] </ref> limit the shapability of real-time and aggregated traffic multiplexed at routers while at the same time reserving bandwidth that is significantly smaller than the peak transmission rate, thus making this approach extremely costly.
