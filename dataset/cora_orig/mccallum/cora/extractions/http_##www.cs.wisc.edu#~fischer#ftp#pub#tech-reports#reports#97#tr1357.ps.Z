Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the relative power of quantum and classical (probabilistic) machines when the limiting resource is space rather than time. In particular, quantum simulations of probabilistic machines and probabilistic simulations of quantum machines are presented which imply the following relationships. (2) Any QTM running in space s can be simulated by an unbounded error PTM running in space O(s). No assumptions on the probability of error or running time for the QTM are required, but it is assumed that all transition amplitudes of the quantum It follows that unbounded error, space O(s) bounded quantum Turing machines and probabilistic Turing machines are equivalent in power, and that any space s QTM can be simulated deterministically in space O(s 2 ). We also consider quantum analogues of nondeterministic and one-sided error probabilistic space-bounded classes, and prove some simple relationships regarding these classes. machine are rational.

Reference-contexts: It is known that the power of QTMs depends greatly upon the values which the transition function may take; in the absence of any restrictions, it is possible to encode a great deal of information in these values. For example, it is shown in <ref> [1] </ref> that QTMs can recognize non-recursive sets in polynomial time, logarithmic space and with bounded probability of error if allowed to have arbitrary transcendental transition amplitudes. <p> Thus we must place some restriction on these values in order to avoid this problem, and so we will insist that all transition functions of QTMs may take only rational values. Although many quantum algorithms use algebraic transition amplitudes, it is shown in <ref> [1] </ref> that, for the case of bounded error polynomial time, machines with algebraic amplitudes are equivalent in power to ones with rational amplitudes. <p> The values ff and fi could be taken to be any rational numbers in the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, but the values above are sufficient for our needs. A proof of this lemma can be found in the appendix. An immediate consequence of Lemma 3.1 is that we have NQ H SPACE (s) PrQ H SPACE (s) (take ff = 1, fi = 1 2 ). <p> Proposition 4.4 co-C = SPACE (s) NQSPACE (s). For a proof of this proposition and definition of co-C = SPACE (s), see the appendix. 5 Probabilistic simulations of quantum classes In this section, we discuss probabilistic simulations of space-bounded quantum machines. In <ref> [1] </ref> it is shown that unbounded error, polynomial time probabilistic machines are capable of simulating polynomial time quantum machines. In the context of space-bounded classes, it is possible to modify this simulation to obtain the result PrQ H SPACE (s) PrSPACE (s).

Reference-contexts: Further, it follows that unbounded error, space-bounded QTMs do not lose power if required to halt absolutely; a result which is analogous to one proved by Jung [20] for the probabilistic case (see also <ref> [2] </ref>). Our proof of these relationships uses a technique similar to the one used in the probabilistic case; the problem of determining whether or not quantum machines accept with probability exceeding 1=2 is reduced to the problem of comparing determinants of integer matrices. <p> Corollary 3.5 EQSPACE (s) = RQSPACE (s) = NQSPACE (s). It will be demonstrated in the two sections which follow that the class NQSPACE (s) corresponds to the counting class co-C = SPACE (s), defined analogously to co-C = L for s (n) = log n (see <ref> [2] </ref>, and also see Section A.4 in the appendix for an equivalent definition.) It is not known whether C = SPACE (s), and hence NQSPACE (s), is closed under complementation. 4 Quantum simulations of classical classes In this section, we discuss quantum simulations of probabilistic machines. <p> Proposition 4.2 PrSPACE (s) PrQ H SPACE (s). (Here we rely on the fact that PrSPACE (s) = Pr H SPACE (s), proved in [20] (see also <ref> [2] </ref>).) In the case that M has probability of error bounded away from 1/2, we may apply Lemmas 3.1 and 3.3 to M 0 to obtain a QTM which accepts with probability p acc (x) 2 p acc (x) 2 +p rej (x) 2 and rejects with probability p acc (x) <p> However, we are able to obtain the somewhat stronger result PrQSPACE (s) PrSPACE (s) by adopting techniques which have been used to prove Pr H SPACE (s) = PrSPACE (s) (see <ref> [2, 20] </ref>). Lemma 5.1 Let M be a QTM running in space s. <p> Finally, we note the following relationship. Proposition 5.5 NQSPACE (s) co-C = SPACE (s). Proof. It follows from the proof of Lemma 5.1 that the matrix A has zero determinant if and only if M accepts x with probability zero. As noted in <ref> [2] </ref>, singularity of integer matrices is in C = L, from which it follows that testing non-singularity of A can be performed in co-C = SPACE (s). From Propositions 4.4 and 5.5, we have Corollary 5.6 NQSPACE (s) = co-C = SPACE (s). <p> Hence, we have that M 0 accepts and rejects with probability 2 2 , respectively, after t 0 steps as claimed. A.4 Proof of Proposition 4.4 The class C = SPACE (s) may be defined in an analogous way to the class C = L, defined in <ref> [2] </ref>. However, we will use the following equivalent definition. <p> See <ref> [2] </ref> for further discussion on this class. Proof of Proposition 4.4. Let L 2 C = SPACE (s), and let M be a PTM for L in the sense of Definition A.1.

Reference-contexts: It was proved by Bennett in <ref> [3] </ref> that any DTM computation can be simulated by an RTM.

In the interest of simplicity, we prefer to include this restriction as part of the definition of multi-tape QTMs.

We will assume that integers are efficiently encoded as strings over f0; 1g in such a way that (1) the empty string represents 0, and (2) the integers and representations are in one-to-one correspondence. (Such an encoding appears in <ref> [15] </ref>: letting 0x represent the positive integer with binary representation 1x and letting 1x represent the negative integer having absolute value with binary representation 1x, we have a suitable encoding.)

Reference-contexts: It is not clear, however, that a similar technique can be applied in the space-bounded case without requiring the QTM to have multiple access to its (simulated) coin-flips. Since a PTM can perform useful work even after a number of steps which is doubly exponential in its space-bound <ref> [16] </ref>, a QTM storing the values of the required number of coin-flips would, in the worst case, require considerably more space than the O (s 2 ) deterministic simulation mentioned above.

Reference-contexts: The model for quantum computation which we use in this paper is the quantum Turing machine (QTM) model, first formally defined by Deutsch [12], and also discussed in <ref> [5, 6, 31] </ref>. Specifically, we use a multitape version of the QTM model; in addition to having a read-only input tape, our QTMs also have an output tape which is assumed to be observed after each and every computation step.
