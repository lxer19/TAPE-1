Title: A Multiscale Method for the Double Layer Potential Equation on a Polyhedron  
Author: W. Dahmen, B. Kleemann, S. Prodorf and R. Schneider 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the numerical solution of the double layer potential equation on polyhedra. Specifically, we consider collocation schemes based on multiscale decompositions of piecewise linear finite element spaces defined on polyhedra. An essential difficulty is that the resulting linear systems are not sparse. However, for uniform grids and periodic problems one can show that the use of multiscale bases gives rise to matrices that can be well approximated by sparse matrices in such a way that the solutions to the perturbed equations exhibits still sufficient accuracy. Our objective is to explore to what extent the presence of corners and edges in the domain as well as the lack of uniform dis-cretizations affects the performance of such schemes. Here we propose a concrete algorithm, describe its ingredients, discuss some consequences, future perspectives, and open questions, and present the results of numerical experiments for several test domains including non-convex domains.

Reference-contexts: Their algorithms are based on explicit multipole expansions of the underlying potential. In particular, the algorithm in [22] concerns boundary element methods. An intriguing alternative to this approach was recently proposed by Beylkin, Coifman and Rokhlin <ref> [5] </ref> based on multiscale decompositions of appropriate trial spaces spanned by compactly supported wavelets. A multigrid algorithm for fast matrix vector multiplication which was developed independently by Brandt/Lubrecht and Harten [6, 23] is actually closely related to the wavelet method. <p> But its practical realization is rather complicated since higher order polynomials must be implemented.

Motivated by these results a systematic study of a wide class of generalized Petrov-Galerkin schemes, for a similarly wide class of pseudo-differential equations was undertaken in [12, 13, 14]. This covers collocation as well as classical Galerkin and Petrov-Galerkin methods. <p> The objective of this paper is therefore to study the performance of analogous multiscale versions of the boundary element method for closed polyhedral surfaces. However, instead of treating Galerkin schemes as in <ref> [5] </ref> we focus here essentially on collocation which is used quite frequently in applications. In principle, this is covered by the general analysis in [13] which, however, as mentioned above, is confined to periodic problems, i.e., smooth domains, and uniform grids. The present setting is essentially different. <p> There the decay of the entries was studied systematically for periodic problems. Below in Section 4 we will therefore be content with briefly indicating the basic idea. We now turn to specify the complementary matrices C l . To this end, recall from <ref> [5, 13] </ref> that the compression rate for the matrices A j is expected to depend on the order d of vanishing moments of the functions l K . By this we mean that Z l holds for each t 2 0 and every polynomial p of degree less than d. <p> They support efficient preconditioning for non zero order operators (cf. [11, 13]), regularization of linear ill-posed problems [18], and matrix compression <ref> [5, 13] </ref>. The latter issue is closely related to atomic decompositions of Calderon-Zygmund operators. These properties are based on the fact, that wavelets provide unconditional schauder bases for a wide scale of Sobolev, Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. <p> In particular, the results in [13] for the periodic case suggest that, not only when dealing with Galerkin approximations but also for collocation schemes, the entries in the corresponding matrices decay away from block diagonals (cp. e.g. <ref> [5] </ref>). This should facilitate an efficient compression, i.e., an approximation of A j ' T j or j by a sparse matrix, so that the solution to the perturbed system is still sufficiently accurate. <p> For periodic boundary conditions this could be rigorously confirmed in [13] for a wide class of operators as well as numerical schemes based on uniform grids. Following the lines of [13] entries of A j ' T j may be estimated (similarly as in the case of Galerkin schemes <ref> [5] </ref>) as follows. First assume that x L is some vertex such that the support of j L is contained in some triangle t 2 0 . <p> ' C j1 : More generally, defining A l ' M j1 M l ; '; := (M l ) fl A l+1 ;' := (C l ) fl A l+1 A l ';' C l and compounding these matrices yields the so called atomic decomposition of A j ' <ref> [5, 13, 23] </ref>. The estimation of the entries of the atomic decomposition can be used for ultimately estimating the entries of (T j ) fl A j ' T j .

Reference-contexts: An intriguing alternative to this approach was recently proposed by Beylkin, Coifman and Rokhlin [5] based on multiscale decompositions of appropriate trial spaces spanned by compactly supported wavelets. A multigrid algorithm for fast matrix vector multiplication which was developed independently by Brandt/Lubrecht and Harten <ref> [6, 23] </ref> is actually closely related to the wavelet method. <p> However, since these points correspond to a lower dimensional set one should not expect this to affect the overall accuracy in any significant way. One should mention that the univariate counterpart of the matrix C j already appears in <ref> [6, 23] </ref>. There it is used for a different purpose, namely to complement the refinement matrix corresponding to the relation (3.1) for the delta-distribution to an invertible matrix analogous to (3.9). <p> In the same way it arises also in [44] in a bivariate setup when converting the hierarchical basis representation into the nodal basis representation. Of course, one could use other masks from <ref> [6, 23] </ref> to increase d in (3.28) but we dispense here with this option for the reasons mentioned before. 3.3 Stability, Biorthogonality If the matrices (M j ; C j ) and (D j ; G j ) have uniformly bounded L 2 -norms, which means that the matrices (M j <p> For the above choice of M j and C j this is indeed the case as is already suggested by the following simple observation. By the above remarks concerning its role in <ref> [6, 23, 44] </ref>, C j must have full rank. Since its columns are orthogonal to those in M j which is also known to have full rank the matrix (M j ; C j ) must be invertible. However, this stability between two levels is not quite sufficient. <p> As mentioned before the transformation defined by (3.11), which is also used in <ref> [6] </ref>, is not stable. There are several strategies for establishing stability.

Similar techniques such as the frequency decomposition multigrid method [20, 21] came up in different contexts.

Similar techniques such as the frequency decomposition multigrid method [20, 21] came up in different contexts. In this section we describe the type of gen eral multiscale decomposition techniques which will be used in our algorithm. Some theoretical background can be found in [7, 23]. 3.1 Decomposition of Function Spaces The basic philosophy of multiscale techniques is to view objects on a high discretization level as successive updates of coarser versions. This is usually realized through corresponding decompositions of underlying function spaces serving as continuous models of the data under consideration. <p> ; (D j ) fl C j = 0 ; (G j ) fl M j = 0 : (3:10) We remark that the stability of the ' j K combined with the relation (3.8) or (3.9) implies the stability of the functions j K ; K 2 j (cf. <ref> [7] </ref>), for fixed j 2 IN . <p> Un fortunately, due to the lack of moment conditions (see (3.28) below), this very handy decomposition is not quite appropriate for our purposes. However, it can be used to de rive from it other decompositions which are better suited. More information about this issue can be found in <ref> [7] </ref> where these questions are discussed in much more generality. We postpone the actual specification of the matrices C j and assume at this point that they are given and that they are sparse, i.e., are defined through stencils with finite support. <p> j relative to the nodal basis B j ' is obtained by the following reverse process w 0 w 1 w 2 w j1 u 0 ! u 1 ! u 2 u j1 ! u j (3:20) which involves now the matrices M l ; C l (see also <ref> [7] </ref>). Only those matrices will be needed in the present context. <p> Since the exactness of the quadrature (2.18) limits the overall convergence rate to two we expect vanishing moments of order d = 2 to be sufficient. It is shown in <ref> [7] </ref> how to construct from (3.11) matrices C l ; D l ; G l which are all sparse such that the corresponding spaces W l in (3.6) have the form W l = (Q l+1 Q l )V l+1 where the Q l are local projectors onto the spaces V

Reference-contexts: In the classical setting of multiresolution analysis for uniform grids on IR n stability can be guaranteed, even when dealing with non-orthogonal complements W j , by constructing biorthogonal systems of wavelets <ref> [9] </ref>. A resulting necessary and sufficient condition for stability is, however, not easy to verify in practice. In the present context this approach amounts to the following task. <p> and hence the whole algorithm requires only the matrices M j ; C j while the dual pair D j ; G j is only needed to construct a complete biorthogonal system of functions as in (3.37), which in turn can be used to establish stability of T j (cf. <ref> [9] </ref>). 4 Matrix Compression Wavelet approximations to operators have gained considerable importance because of several reasons. They support efficient preconditioning for non zero order operators (cf. [11, 13]), regularization of linear ill-posed problems [18], and matrix compression [5, 13].

Furthermore, compression rate and consistency error can be balanced in a way that the solutions to the compressed systems exhibit under certain circumstances still asymptotically optimal convergence rates relative to the exact solutions of Au = f . <p> For the tetrahedron this is confirmed by the condition numbers of the transformed ma 20 trix and the resulting number of iterations needed for the solution of the corresponding linear system by GMRES (see Table 9). In addition we have simulated the atomic decomposition (see <ref> [13] </ref> for more details) by compressing the matrices of the type A j1 j1 j1 ; given by (4.9). The compression and accuracy is observed to be somewhat worse than for the wavelet representation (cp. Table 10). <p> In addition the resulting error is already unacceptable. If one wants to retain sufficient accuracy only a minor compression is admissible. Finally, compression rates which are comparable to those for the multiscale representation yields completely wrong results. This is in agreement with our theoretical predictions <ref> [13] </ref>. In fact, since a compression of A j neglects the influence of the far field, one cannot expect this to work. 6 Concluding Remarks Our aim was to develop first a possibly cheap and unsophisticated scheme. In spite of a relatively strong compression one observes acceptable accuracy.

Reference-contexts: An intriguing alternative to this approach was recently proposed by Beylkin, Coifman and Rokhlin [5] based on multiscale decompositions of appropriate trial spaces spanned by compactly supported wavelets. A multigrid algorithm for fast matrix vector multiplication which was developed independently by Brandt/Lubrecht and Harten <ref> [6, 23] </ref> is actually closely related to the wavelet method. <p> While initially orthogonal decompositions of shift invariant spaces were considered, more general multiscale decomposition techniques have emerged from this concept (see e.g. <ref> [7, 23] </ref>). Similar techniques such as the frequency decomposition multigrid method [20, 21] came up in different contexts. In this section we describe the type of gen eral multiscale decomposition techniques which will be used in our algorithm. Some theoretical background can be found in [7, 23]. 3.1 Decomposition of Function <p> from this concept (see e.g. <ref> [7, 23] </ref>). Similar techniques such as the frequency decomposition multigrid method [20, 21] came up in different contexts. In this section we describe the type of gen eral multiscale decomposition techniques which will be used in our algorithm. Some theoretical background can be found in [7, 23]. 3.1 Decomposition of Function Spaces The basic philosophy of multiscale techniques is to view objects on a high discretization level as successive updates of coarser versions. This is usually realized through corresponding decompositions of underlying function spaces serving as continuous models of the data under consideration. <p> However, since these points correspond to a lower dimensional set one should not expect this to affect the overall accuracy in any significant way. One should mention that the univariate counterpart of the matrix C j already appears in <ref> [6, 23] </ref>. There it is used for a different purpose, namely to complement the refinement matrix corresponding to the relation (3.1) for the delta-distribution to an invertible matrix analogous to (3.9). <p> In the same way it arises also in [44] in a bivariate setup when converting the hierarchical basis representation into the nodal basis representation. Of course, one could use other masks from <ref> [6, 23] </ref> to increase d in (3.28) but we dispense here with this option for the reasons mentioned before. 3.3 Stability, Biorthogonality If the matrices (M j ; C j ) and (D j ; G j ) have uniformly bounded L 2 -norms, which means that the matrices (M j <p> For the above choice of M j and C j this is indeed the case as is already suggested by the following simple observation.

Since its columns are orthogonal to those in M j which is also known to have full rank the matrix (M j ; C j ) must be invertible.

Reference-contexts: However, the proof of stability for the discretized collocation is still open. We only remark that stability can be enforced also for discretized collocation by means of certain modifications of the discretization near the edges which was shown for a second order method in <ref> [25] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Probably the first method was the so called panel method, based on piecewise constant collocation (cf.[42, 26, 43, 3]). This method was proved to converge in supremum norm provided that P satisfies a certain condition introduced by Wendland in [42]. Moreover, Kral and Wendland <ref> [28] </ref> showed 4 that the panel method is stable for the case of certain rectangular domains P including those used in our tests. The proof of the stability for the piecewise linear collocation is completely analogous. However, the proof of stability for the discretized collocation is still open.

Reference-contexts: Indeed the double layer potential operator is a Calderon-Zygmund operator. In order to make use of the available theory for double layer potential operators on Lipschitz-surfaces, we will assume throughout this paper that the polyhedron is a Lipschitz-domain with boundary IR 3 (cf. <ref> [32] </ref>). All examples of polyhedra which are treated in our numerical experiments fulfil this condition. Figure 1 shows one example. We conclude this subsection with a brief overview over the various existing numerical schemes for the approximate solution of Au = f .

Reference-contexts: However, in spite of these adverse facts we observe surprisingly good accuracy and convergence rates (see Table 1). Former excerpts from our numerical experiments mentioned in <ref> [14, 38] </ref> were obtained without singularity subtraction. These results were observed to be sufficiently accurate when P is a cube. But the results turned out to be visibly worse for noncon vex domains. <p> There are several strategies for establishing stability.
