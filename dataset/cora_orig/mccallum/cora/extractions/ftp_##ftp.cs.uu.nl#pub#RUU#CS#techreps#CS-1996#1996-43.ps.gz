Abstract: We present a new approach to the multi-robot path planning problem, where a number of robots are to change their positions through feasible motions in the same static environment. Rather than the usual decoupled planning, we use a coordinated approach. As a result we can show that the method is probabilistically complete, that is, any solvable problem will be solved within a finite amount of time. A data-structure storing multi-robot motions is built in two steps. First, a roadmap is constructed for just one robot. For this we use the Probabilistic Path Planner, which guarantees that the approach can be easily applied to different robot types. In the second step, a number of these simple roadmaps are combined into a roadmap for the composite robot. This data-structure can be used for retrieving multi-robot paths. We have applied the method to car-like robots, and simulation results are presented which show that problems involving up to 5 car-like robots in complex environments are solved successfully in computation times in the order of seconds, after a preprocessing step (the construction of the data structure) that consumes, at most, a few minutes. Such a preprocessing step however needs to be performed just once, for a given static environment.

Reference-contexts: This is formalised in Section 3. 3 modifying the initial paths using a Petri net formulation. In concept the planner is applicable to systems with many robots. The presented implementation however only works for a two robot system. Alami et al. propose a Plan Merging Paradigm <ref> [ARIS95] </ref> for execution and control of a large fleet of autonomous mobile robots. The robots incrementally merge their plans into a set of already coordinated plans, through exchange of information about their current state and their future actions.

Reference-contexts: For each picked robot a path is planned, avoiding collisions with the static obstacles as well as the previously picked robots, which are considered as moving obstacles. An important question in this scheme is how to assign the different priorities to the robots. Buckley <ref> [Buc89] </ref> proposes to assign the priorities such that the number of robots that can move in a straight line from their start configuration to their goal configuration (so-called linear robots) is maximised. In [War90], prioritisation is combined with a potential field that is defined on a time-varying configuration space.

This flexibility propagates to the multi-robot extension that we present in this paper. For more details on PPP we refer the reader to <ref> [O S94, KL94, HST94, SO95b, K SLO96, Kav95] </ref>. Applying PPP to car-like robots asks for a local planner that computes paths that are feasible for these robots. <p> This local planner has the properties that guarantee probabilistic completeness. For more details on PPP applied to car-like robots, we refer to previous work <ref> [ SO95b] </ref>. 8.3 Construction of the super-graphs Note that, given a simple roadmap G = (V; E), Definition 8 gives no unique specification of a G-subdivision tree T . Hence, an important question is how to compute this data-structure. In our implementation we use a simple heuristic algorithm. <p> We say L has the local topological property TP iff We refer to B ffi (c) as the *-reachable ffi-ball of c. A local planner verifying TP, at least in theory, always exists, due to the robots local controllability. It has been shown <ref> [ SO95b, SO95c, Sve96] </ref> that a local planner for a robot A verifying TP guarantees probabilistic completeness of PPP for A.

Reference-contexts: That is, C f is A's free configuration space, or free C-space. Given a configuration c, we denote the workspace-area occupied by A, when placed at c, by A (c). 2 Preliminary extended abstracts of this paper have been given in <ref> [ SO95a, SO96] </ref> 4 The free-flying robot: The carlike robot: e x e car-like rectangle. The edges are shown in thick lines. In the left roadmap the actual local paths coincide with the edges.

Reference-contexts: Even the apparently simple problem of motion planning for arbitrarily many rectangular robots in an empty rectangular workspace is still PSPACE-complete [HSS84]. Centralised planning Schwartz and Sharir <ref> [SS83] </ref> have described an exact cell decomposition algorithm for multiple discs in the plane moving among polygonal obstacles. Their approach is based on critical curves. The complexity of the algorithm is O (n 3 ) for 2 discs, and O (n 13 ) for 3 discs.

Reference-contexts: Then, in Section 9.2 we give a proof of the completeness claim. 9.1 Local controllability and the local topological property First we describe the concept local controllability (in the literature also referred to as smalltime local controllability or local-local controllability), adopting the terminology introduced by Sussman <ref> [Sus83] </ref>. Given a robot A, let A be its control system. That is, A describes the velocities that A can attain in C-space. For a configuration c of a robot A, the set of configurations that A can reach within time T is denoted by A A ( T; c).

Reference-contexts: Then, it tests whether this path intersects any obstacles. If so, failure is returned, and otherwise the local planner succeeds. If the local planner is chosen properly (see also Section 9 and <ref> [ SO95b, Sve96] </ref>), then probabilistic completeness of the (global) planner is guaranteed. The local planner and an associated distance measure, used for selecting the neighbours of a new node, are the only robot dependent components of PPP. This makes the method flexible and easily applicable to different robot-types. <p> We say L has the local topological property TP iff We refer to B ffi (c) as the *-reachable ffi-ball of c. A local planner verifying TP, at least in theory, always exists, due to the robots local controllability. It has been shown <ref> [ SO95b, SO95c, Sve96] </ref> that a local planner for a robot A verifying TP guarantees probabilistic completeness of PPP for A. <p> Currently we are working on methods to give upper bounds on the expected running times of the algorithm, in terms of certain geometrical properties of the free C-space (see also <ref> [ Sve96] </ref>). 10 Conclusions We have presented a new approach to multi-robot path planning, that is particularly suited for constrained environments. Roadmaps for the composite robot are derived from roadmaps for the underlying simple robots.

Reference-contexts: The robots can be discs or manipulators. Ardema and Skowronski [AS91] describe a method for generating collision-free motion control for two specific, constrained manipulators, by modelling the problem as a non-cooperative game. Other centralised approaches for tackling multi-robot planning problems include various potential field techniques. Tournassoud <ref> [Tou86] </ref> proposes a potential field approach where the motion coordination is expressed as a local optimisation problem. Barraquand and Latombe [BL90, BL91] have applied the randomised path planner RPP, a general potential field method that uses random motions for escaping local minima, to multi-robot planning problems.

Reference-contexts: For this reason many researchers have dropped the requirement of completeness and focused on decoupled approaches. This has resulted in many planners that solve interesting problems, but satisfy no form of completeness. As also pointed out by La Valle and Hutchinson in <ref> [VH95] </ref>, it seems that most research has focused on two opposite ends of a spectrum, with centralised planning at one end and decoupled planning at the other. <p> This can be achieved by constraining the robots to lie on independent roadmaps (instead of paths). This roadmap coordination idea has, in different forms, previously been used by Shibita and Fukuda in [SF93] and by La Valle and Hutchinson in <ref> [VH95] </ref>. The super-graph scheme that we propose in this paper 2 falls in the class of roadmap coordination methods. Roadmaps are constructed for the separate robots, and the robots are constrained to lie on these.

Reference-contexts: Buckley [Buc89] proposes to assign the priorities such that the number of robots that can move in a straight line from their start configuration to their goal configuration (so-called linear robots) is maximised. In <ref> [War90] </ref>, prioritisation is combined with a potential field that is defined on a time-varying configuration space. O'Donnell and Lozano-Perez [OLP89] introduced a decoupled planning approach called path coordination, which is based on a scheduling technique originally developed by Yannakakis et al. [YPK79] for concurrent database access by several users.
