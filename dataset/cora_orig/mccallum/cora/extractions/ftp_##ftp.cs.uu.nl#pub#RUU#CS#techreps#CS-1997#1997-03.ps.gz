Abstract: In this paper we present a formalisation of motivational attitudes, the attitudes that are the driving forces behind the actions of agents. We consider the statics of these attitudes both at the assertion level, i.e. ranging over propositions, and at the practition 1 level, i.e. ranging over actions, as well as the dynamics of these attitudes, i.e. how they change over time. Starting from an agent's wishes, which form the primitive, most fundamental motivational attitude, we define its goals as induced by those wishes that do not yet hold, i.e. are unfulfilled, but are within the agent's practical possibility to bring about, i.e. are implementable for the agent. Among these unfulfilled, implementable wishes the agent selects those that qualify as its goals. Based on its knowledge on its goals and practical possibilities, an agent may make certain commitments. In particular, an agent may commit itself to actions that it knows to be correct and feasible to bring about some of its known goals. As soon as it no longer knows its commitments to be useful, i.e. leading to fulfilment of some goal, and practically possible, an agent is able to undo these commitments. Both the act of committing as well as that of undoing commitments is modelled as a special model-transforming action in our framework, which extends the usual state-transition paradigm of Propositional Dynamic Logic. In between making and undoing commitments, an agent is committed to all the actions that are known to be identical for all practical purposes to the ones in its agenda. By modifying the agent's agenda during the execution of actions in a straightforward way, it is ensured that commitments display an acceptable behaviour with regard to composite actions.

Reference-contexts: For these wishes are both implicit in the terminology of Levesque [19] and passive in the sense of Castelfranchi et al. <ref> [3] </ref>. Being implicit, it will not be the case that agents explicitly desire all of their wishes 5 . Being passive, wishes in themselves do not actively influence the course of action that an agent is going to take.

Reference-contexts: Treating desires and intentions as primitive, Rao & Georgeff focus on the process of intention revision rather than the `commitment acquisition' which is essential to our formalisation. Both desires and intentions in their framework suffer from the problems associated with logical omniscience. To avoid these problems, Cavedon et al. <ref> [4] </ref> propose the use of non-normal logics of intention and belief in the BDI-architecture, and more in particular Rantala's `impossible worlds' framework [28]. This `impossible worlds' approach was originally proposed as a way to solve the problems of logical omniscience for informational attitudes.

Reference-contexts: Research on this subject has held the limelight ever since the pioneering work of Moore [26] in which knowledge and actions are considered. Over the years important contributions have been made on both informational attitudes like knowledge and belief [11], and motivational attitudes like commitments and obligations <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> Having dealt with both informational attitudes and various aspects of action in previous work, this paper is aimed at providing a formalisation of the motivational attitudes of rational agents. In the last decade various formalisations of different kinds of motivational attitudes have been proposed <ref> [5, 29, 37] </ref>. The approach presented in this paper makes three main contributions to the theory of formalising motivational attitudes. Firstly, we consider a fairly wide scope of motivational attitudes, situated at two different levels. <p> It is therefore also not clear which of the aforementioned motivational attitudes are relevant, and worth formalising, when modelling rational agents. In their BDI-architecture, Rao & Georgeff [30] consider desires and intentions to be primitive, and define a notion of commitment in terms of these, Cohen & Levesque <ref> [5] </ref> consider goals to be primitive and define intentions using goals, and Shoham [35] restricts himself to formalising commitments. In our opinion each of these formalisations lacks some of the aspects that are vital to modelling motivational attitudes. <p> Moreover, the rest of the definition ensures that the agenda is also updated in all states reachable from s (or elements from its equivalence class) 7 Our paraphrase of Cohen & Levesque's motto `intention is choice plus commitment' <ref> [5] </ref> could therefore be stated as `commitments are chosen intentions'. 17 by performing actions fi that are according to the fulfilment of executing the action ff by putting in the agenda the `remainder' of ff after its `partial execution' fi. <p> Related work The formalisation of motivational attitudes has received much attention within the agent research community. Probably the most influential account of motivational attitudes is due to Cohen & Levesque <ref> [5] </ref>. Starting from the primitive notions of implicit goals and beliefs, Cohen & Levesque define so-called persistent goals, which are goals which agents give up only when they think they are either satisfied or will never be true, and intentions, both ranging over propositions and over actions.

Reference-contexts: The last formalisation of motivational attitudes that we would like to mention is the one proposed by Dignum et al. <ref> [8] </ref>. In this formalisation, which is inspired by and based on research on deontic logic as carried out by Dignum et al., notions like decisions, intentions and commitments are modelled.

Reference-contexts: Originally, Fagin & Halpern <ref> [9] </ref> introduced the idea of awareness sets as a means to solve the so-called problems of logical omniscience. As we will see in Section 6, the effect of the selection sets on the behaviour of goals is similar to that of the awareness sets on the properties of knowledge. <p> mail a letter while (intuitively) not being obliged to either mail the letter or burn it. 4 Even stronger, human agents will almost always suffer from conflicts between their wishes. 5 For the implicit belief that, in combination with awareness, constitutes explicit belief in the approach of Fagin & Halpern <ref> [9] </ref>, it is also considered unproblematic that the properties of logical omniscience are validated. 10 implementable without requiring a simultaneous implementability of all chosen wishes. How--ever, if desired, constraints like simultaneous implementability are easily formulated.

Reference-contexts: C i ' , ' 2 C (i; s) The definition of r C for the selection actions indeed provides for a correct model transformation. 6 As was pointed out by Maarten de Rijke, defining the implementability operator in this way makes it a kind of `dual master modality' (cf. <ref> [10, 38] </ref>). A formula consisting of a formula ' prefixed by the master modality is true in some state s of a model iff ' holds at all states that are reachable by any finite sequence of transitions from s.

Reference-contexts: In order to not complicate our models further we will not do so in this paper. 7 In our interpretation of actions as given in Definition 4.4 below, we generalise the standard paradigm of actions as state-transitions <ref> [12] </ref> by interpreting actions as transitions between pairs (Model, State) rather than transitions between states per se. Using this more general interpretation we can both account for regular actions that cause a transition between states upon execution, and special actions that transform models.

In their BDI-architecture, Rao & Georgeff <ref> [30] </ref> consider desires and intentions to be primitive, and define a notion of commitment in terms of these, Cohen & Levesque [5] consider goals to be primitive and define intentions using goals, and Shoham [35] restricts himself to formalising commitments. <p> Furthermore the coexistence of goals and intentions ranging over propositions seems to complicate matters unnecessarily. Another important formalisation of motivational attitudes is proposed by Rao & Georgeff <ref> [30] </ref> in their BDI-architecture. Treating desires and intentions as primitive, Rao & Georgeff focus on the process of intention revision rather than the `commitment acquisition' which is essential to our formalisation. Both desires and intentions in their framework suffer from the problems associated with logical omniscience.

Reference-contexts: In their BDI-architecture, Rao & Georgeff [30] consider desires and intentions to be primitive, and define a notion of commitment in terms of these, Cohen & Levesque [5] consider goals to be primitive and define intentions using goals, and Shoham <ref> [35] </ref> restricts himself to formalising commitments. In our opinion each of these formalisations lacks some of the aspects that are vital to modelling motivational attitudes. Firstly, psychological evidence seems to suggest that notions like goals, intentions and commitments are not primitive, but rather induced by some more fundamental notion.

Reference-contexts: Having dealt with both informational attitudes and various aspects of action in previous work, this paper is aimed at providing a formalisation of the motivational attitudes of rational agents. In the last decade various formalisations of different kinds of motivational attitudes have been proposed <ref> [5, 29, 37] </ref>. The approach presented in this paper makes three main contributions to the theory of formalising motivational attitudes. Firstly, we consider a fairly wide scope of motivational attitudes, situated at two different levels. <p> It therefore may come as no surprise that the properties that Cavedon et al. acquire for intentions are highly similar to the properties of goals given in Section 6. We also like to mention here the work by Singh <ref> [37] </ref>, which bears some resemblance me calculus to `maintain the agent's agenda'.

A formula consisting of a formula ' prefixed by the master modality is true in some state s of a model iff ' holds at all states that are reachable by any finite sequence of transitions from s.
