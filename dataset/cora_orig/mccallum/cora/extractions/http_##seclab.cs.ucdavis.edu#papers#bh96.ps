Abstract: An isolated network is critical to the successful analysis of vulnerabilities and attack tools. Maintaining such a network introduces issues of policy and implementation which conict with the need to transport data from the Internet to the network. This paper describes the goals of one isolated network, the policy and implementation that satisfies those goals, and other considerations to protect the confidentiality of data and programs on the isolated network.

Reference-contexts: The four categories are proprietary programs (Prop), development tools (Dev), vulnerabilities data, and attack tools; but as attack tools are part of the vulnerabilities studies, those two categories are merged (Vuln). The Bell-LaPadula model <ref> [1] </ref> allows subjects in compartments to write to objects in the same compartment. This presents a problem: when attack tools are executed and vulnerability exploits are recreated, the exploitation could alter information under study or programs under development.

Reference-contexts: So the model must be modified To appear in Proc. 19th NISSC Page 3 of 9 to provide: 3. a mechanism to ensure that the execution of a process does not affect isoinfo unless it is authorized to do so. Lipner <ref> [2] </ref> showed how to extend the traditional MLS model to provide such a mechanism. Three new categories, AVuln, AProp, and ADev, allow member subjects to alter data or programs in the categories Vuln, Prop, and Dev, respectively. No objects reside in the new categories.

Reference-contexts: Further, providing a robust audit mechanism in this environment would require extensive system modifications. Given these, relying on the standard system audit mechanisms seemed appropriate. 3.4 Analysis Saltzer and Schroeders principles of secure design <ref> [3] </ref> are a useful metric against which to evaluate this design. The principles they enunciate are: 1. Users (processes) should have the minimum set of access rights necessary (least privilege). Procedurally, users are assigned to the least upper bound of the compartments they must access to complete their tasks.

Reference-contexts: Then the users can alter the files, as the disk is local to the vulnerability host and is readable and writable there. One advantage of these procedures is that no locally-developed software is required. Exporting is controlled using vendor-implemented protocols, currently the Network File System <ref> [4] </ref>, and each vendor supplies its own account management facility. While procedures clearly dictate that the isonet is never to be connected to the Internet, not all mistakes can be prevented.

Reference-contexts: The next section describes the modifications to the model and the implementation of a solution to this problem. 4. Uploading and Downloading As research into vulnerabilities began, many helpful users and system administrators offered copies of various attack tools found at their sites. They enciphered these scripts using PGP <ref> [5] </ref> and mailed them to the first author, who moved the letters to a Macintosh, deciphered them, and put the cleartext onto oppies. The cleartext attack Tools could then be placed on the isonet.
