Abstract: Developed only recently, support vector learning machines achieve high generalization ability by minimizing a bound on the expected test error; however, so far there existed no way of adding knowledge about invariances of a classification problem at hand. We present a method of incorporating prior knowledge about transformation invari-ances by applying transformations to support vectors, the training ex amples most critical for determining the classification boundary.
