Abstract: The existing SCSI parallel bus has been widely used in supporting multimedia applications. However, it may not fully utilize the aggregate throughput from disks in supporting continuous media because of its unfair bus accesses. The emerging serial interface, Serial Storage Architecture (SSA), provides high data bandwidth, fair accesses, and fault tolerance. The fairness algorithm in SSA ensures a fraction of data bandwidth is allocated to each disk. In this paper, we study the performance of SSA and SCSI in supporting continuous media.

Reference-contexts: Reddy and Wyllie [5] briefly discussed the effect of unfair SCSI bus contention in a multimedia system based on a simulation. One of the emerging standards using serial interconnections is Serial Storage Architecture (SSA) <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>. SSA provides the aggregated data bandwidth of 80 MBytes/sec while fast-and-wide SCSI offers 20 MBytes/sec. A node in SSA has four ports with two in and two out links. Each link supports 20MBytes/sec bandwidth. Hence a node can sustain 40MBytes/sec for reads and 40MBytes/sec for writes.

Reference-contexts: To compare SSA and SCSI, a cluster of IBM RS/600 Model 590 workstations was used. Four barracuda disks were attached into fast-wide SCSI bus. Sixteen IBM Ul-trastar disks were used in SSA experiments. The SSA configuration used is shown in Figure 1. The detailed disk parameters are given in <ref> [4] </ref>, and [6]. They are comparable disks with rotational speed of 7200 rpm and average rotational latency of 4.17ms. Data bandwidth of fast-wide SCSI bus is 20MB/s.
