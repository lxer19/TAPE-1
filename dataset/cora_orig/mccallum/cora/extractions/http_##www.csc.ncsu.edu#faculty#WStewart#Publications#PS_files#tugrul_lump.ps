Abstract: In this paper, it is shown that nearly completely decomposable (NCD) Markov chains are quasi-lumpable. The state space partition is the natural one, and the technique may be used to compute lower and upper bounds on the stationary probability of each NCD block. In doing so, a lower bounding nonnegative coupling matrix is employed. The nature of the stationary probability bounds is closely related to the structure of this lower bounding matrix. Irreducible lower bounding matrices give tighter bounds compared with bounds obtained using reducible lower bounding matrices. It is also noticed that the quasi-lumped chain of a NCD Markov chain is an ill-conditioned matrix and the bounds obtained therefrom generally will not be tight. However, under some circumstances, it is possible to compute the stationary probabilities of some NCD blocks exactly.

Reference-contexts: Note that it is also possible for C s to be an irreducible matrix. For part (iv), let A = I C s . To prove that A is a nonsingular M-matrix <ref> [1] </ref>, the following properties need to be shown (see [9], pp. 531-532): 1. a i;i &gt; 0; 8i and a i;j 0; 8i 6= j: 2. <p> Note that, this is the case if each row of blocks in P possesses at least one block with unequal row sums, and therefore it is quite likely to happen. Finally, the nonsingularity is a direct consequence of condition (I 29 ) on p. 136 of <ref> [1] </ref>. 11 Part (v) follows from Lemma 5.1. A sufficient condition for C s C to be true is for P to be diagonally dominant or for P to have diagonal elements larger than the degree of coupling.

Reference-contexts: Whereas, if all stationary probabilities of the NCD Markov chain are to be computed, iterative aggregation-disaggregation (IAD) should be the method of choice (see [8], <ref> [2] </ref>, [12], [15], [14], [16]). In the sections to come, it is shown that NCD Markov chains are quasi-lumpable. The state space partition coincides with the NCD block partition, and the technique may be used to compute lower and upper bounds on the probability of being in each NCD block.

Reference-contexts: The procedure amounts to solving linear systems of order equal to the number of NCD blocks in the chain. Thereafter, quasi-lumpability is related to the polyhedra theory of Courtois and Semal for stochastic matrices [4], and it is shown that under certain circumstances the quasi-lumped chain (as defined in <ref> [5] </ref>) is a lower bounding matrix for the coupling matrix of the NCD chain. Additionally, another substochastic matrix guaranteed to be a lower bounding coupling matrix is given. <p> The next section provides the definitions of lumpability (see [7], x6.3) and quasi-lumpability (see <ref> [5] </ref>), and the third section shows how quasi-lumpability applies to NCD Markov chains. The effects of quasi-lumpability on the 8 fi 8 Courtois matrix are illustrated in the fourth section. The relation between the quasi-lumped chain and the coupling matrix of a NCD Markov chain is investigated in section five. <p> At this point we should stress that not all Markov chains are lumpable. In fact, only a small percentage of Markov chains arising in real-life applications is expected to be lumpable. However, in x3 it is shown that NCD Markov chains are quasi-lumpable; that is, almost lumpable <ref> [5] </ref>. The following informative example demonstrates the concept of lumpability. Example 2.2 Let 1 2 3 4 1 3 0 B 0:2 0:3 0:4 0:1 0:5 0:1 0:1 0:3 1 C We take partition S = f1; 3g S f2; 4g. <p> value among all possible alternatives (since P and P * may not be unique); k i;j is a constant value that depends only on i and j, and p s;s 0 is the one-step transition probability of going from state s to state s 0 in the matrix P (see <ref> [5] </ref>, p. 2). The computation of the quasi-lumped chain is discussed in the next section. A similar definition applies to a CTMC as in Definition 2.1. The concept of *-quasi-lumpability is illustrated in the following 6 fi 6 example. <p> If it is possible for any diagonal element to become negative, the diagonal of P s may be scaled by performing the transformation ffP s + (1 ff)I; (3:5) where 0 &lt; ff &lt; 1, on P s as suggested in <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> We use the definition of quasi-lumpability in <ref> [5] </ref> to be consistent in terminology.
