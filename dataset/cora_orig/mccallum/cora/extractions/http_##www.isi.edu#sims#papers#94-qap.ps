Abstract: Researchers have extensively studied the issues that arise in applying a general-purpose planner to the problem of stacking blocks. The interesting question is whether these are the same issues that arise in solving real-world problems. In this paper we focus on the problem of applying a general-purpose planner to generate query access plans for a multidatabase system. We identify both the representational issues and search issues that arise in applying a planner to this problem. It turns out that to represent this problem requires a representation of complex objects, ability to reason about resource constraints, and a functional interface to handle the low-level details. The search for a plan differs from traditional work in that the quality of the plans is important since there are many possible plans, and the system needs to reliably produce plans in a short amount of time.

Reference-contexts: For example, Figure 1 illustrates a goal which specifies that the set of data be sent to the output device of the sims information server (Arens et al. 1993). The data to be retrieved is defined by the query expressed in the Loom knowledge representation language <ref> (MacGregor 1990) </ref>. This particular query requests all seaports and corresponding ships with a range greater than 10,000 that can be accommodated within each port. The first argument to the retrieve expression is the parameter list, which specifies which parameters of the query to return.

Reference-contexts: Government, or any person or agency connected with them. executing different plans for the same query can range from a few milliseconds to a few years. The database community has been building specialized systems for performing query access planning for many years <ref> (Jarke and Koch 1984, Yu and Chang 1984) </ref>. In order to address this problem these systems exploit a variety of heuristics and techniques to limit the search space. These approaches have been carefully optimized for the problem of query processing in the single database environment and the distributed database environment.
