Abstract: This paper describes cross-language information-retrieval experiments carried out for TREC-6. Our retrieval method, cross-language latent semantic indexing (CL-LSI), is completely automatic and we were able to use it to create a 3-way English-French-German IR system. This study extends our previous work in terms of the large size of training and testing corpora, the use of low-quality training data, the evaluation using relevance judgments, and the number of languages analyzed.

Reference-contexts: Less strong, but still impressive, results are obtained using imperfectly matched or machine translated mates for training, and mismatches between training and testing data (Dumais, Littman, & Lan-dauer 1997 to appear). CL-LSI has been evaluated in a more traditional relevance-judgment experiment <ref> (Carbonell et al. 1997) </ref>. The implementation of CL-LSI in that study was compared to the generalized vector-space method, example-based query translation, and pseudo-relevance feedback query expansion, as well as a number of other techniques, and fared relatively poorly.

Reference-contexts: The learned associations are specific to the domain of interest, and are derived completely automatically. The singular-value decomposition (SVD) technique is closely related to eigenvector decomposition and factor analysis <ref> (Cullum & Willoughby 1985) </ref>. For information retrieval and filtering applications we begin with a large term-document matrix, in much the same way as vector-space or Boolean methods do.

Reference-contexts: While this use of long queries does not provide a very accurate measure of the performance of CL-LSI in a real retrieval setting, it does give some indication as to whether the language-independent vector representation of meaning is at all reasonable. A typical result <ref> (Dumais, Landauer, & Littman 1996) </ref> is that CL-LSI returns cross-language mates over 98% of the time from a test set of 1,500 mates.

Reference-contexts: Cross-language LSI The techniques of mono-lingual LSI transfer easily to the cross-language case simply by using a different notion of the term-document matrix <ref> (Landauer & Littman 1990) </ref>. <p> Previous Evaluations of CL-LSI In past work, we have used a number of informal evaluation techniques to help determine whether retrieval systems created using CL-LSI can effectively compare text objects between languages. In the overlap technique <ref> (Landauer & Littman 1990) </ref>, we began with a set of several thousand English and French mates and compared each with a set of English queries to determine the 10 best matching French documents and 10 best matching English documents to each query.

Reference-contexts: Less strong, but still impressive, results are obtained using imperfectly matched or machine translated mates for training, and mismatches between training and testing data <ref> (Dumais, Littman, & Lan-dauer 1997 to appear) </ref>. CL-LSI has been evaluated in a more traditional relevance-judgment experiment (Carbonell et al. 1997). <p> Of the 40k German documents in our core training set, 12 of them did not have available translations into English. Therefore, we carried out a CL-LSI analysis of a 39,988-document collection of German, with a French and English mate for each German document. (Note that preliminary experiments <ref> (Littman & Keim 1997) </ref> indicate that it is important for 3-language training collections to use complete sets of mates.) Table 2 gives mate-retrieval results for the resulting 800-dimensional three-way retrieval system.

Reference-contexts: Background This section provides background on latent semantic indexing (LSI) and its cross-language extension. Other introductions are also available (Deer wester et al. 1990; Berry, Dumais, & O'Brien 1995; Dumais 1995). Latent Semantic Indexing Motivation Latent semantic indexing is a variant of the vector-space method <ref> (Salton & McGill 1983) </ref> in which the dependencies between terms are explicitly modeled and exploited to improve retrieval. One advantage of the LSI representation is that a query can retrieve a relevant document even if they have no words in common.

Reference-contexts: In previous studies, corpora were used in which human translators had generated these mates. In this study, we used automatic methods to generate these mates. Note that neither the alignment <ref> (Sheridan & Ballerini 1996) </ref>, nor the machine translation was actually carried out by our group. We simply used the results of the work of others. To begin, the SDA-G set (185k German documents) was taken as the core set of training documents.
