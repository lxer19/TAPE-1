Reference-contexts: A clique is a totally connected subgraph. The clique distribution method essentially assigns probabilities to each of all the possible labelings of all the cliques that fit within the neighborhood structure. Distributions stored as cliques are very compact, and also, by the Hammersley-Clifford theorem <ref> [ Besag, 1974 ] </ref> , the Markov property is guaranteed to hold. One can convert between clique representation and regular representation in a variety of ways [ Swain, 1990; Sher et al., 1993 ] . The system described in this thesis does not use cliques to store the distribution.

Reference-contexts: MRFs were introduced into common usage for image processing by Cross and Jain [ Cross and Jain, 1983 ] , Besag <ref> [ Besag, 1986 ] </ref> and Geman and Geman [ Geman and Geman, 1984 ] . The concept is to have a distribution over neighborhoods, and to use that distribution to solve images, using a variety of methods. (See chapter 2: Previous Work). <p> 1 : Item 1: The image, as it was scanned/sampled Item 2: The MRF probability density function Item 3: A model for the noise in the image 1 Optimizer refers generally to whatever algorithm is being used to process the image, such as simulated annealing or iterated conditional modes (ICM) <ref> [ Besag, 1986 ] </ref> . 1.3. DOUBLE NEIGHBORHOOD MRFS (DNMRFS) 5 Since item 1 is what the image processing system is given to work with, it requires no further study. <p> THEORETICAL IMPLEMENTATION 17 and the (not necessarily equal) probability that a black pixel turned white. The most obvious method to use when reconstructing an image from the posteriors, is a gradient descent technique, such as Besag's ICM <ref> [ Besag, 1986 ] </ref> . This method selects a pixel of the image at random, and checks whether making that pixel white or black will increase the posterior probability, and sets the pixel accordingly. This algorithm iterates until the image no longer changes. <p> Otherwise, it randomly selects another pixel. By the Markov property, these probabilities can be calculated by considering only the probabilities of the local neighborhoods, with and without the pixel at the center of the neighborhood flipped. This update algorithm is essentially the ICM algorithm of Besag <ref> [ Besag, 1986 ] </ref> . This process of checking and flipping pixels is repeated until the image no longer changes at all. <p> The DNMRF distribution was trained on the pairs of true edge images and edge images of the corrupted images. An example image can be found in figure 5.4. An ICM <ref> [ Besag, 1986 ] </ref> algorithm was applied to the test set at a variety of Hancock-Kittler smoothing levels. Figure 5.5 shows the results with HK=0.010 using distributions sampled from training sets of 3 different sizes. <p> DNMRF distributions was trained on the pairs of true edge images and elements of G, J and GJ, yielding three different distributions. An example of an image from each of the 3 sets can be found in figure 6.4. An ICM algorithm <ref> [ Besag, 1986 ] </ref> was applied to the G, J and GJ versions of the test set, at a variety of Hancock-Kittler smoothing levels. Figure 6.5 shows the results on an image from J. Figure 6.6 shows the results on two images from GJ.

Reference-contexts: This method tends to find a local minimum, but not the global minimum. Simulated annealing is a standard technique that can overcome this problem. The simulated annealing method described in [ Geman and Geman, 1984 ] was employed. This is the same as the heatbath algorithm described in <ref> [ Blake, 1989 ] </ref> . The simulated annealer modifies the calculated posterior probabilities at each step by including a quantity which corresponds to the physical notion of temperature in actual annealing. <p> Geman and Geman [ Geman and Geman, 1984 ] prove that if one uses the schedule that they suggest, the simulated annealing is guaranteed to attain the global minimum. The problem is that their schedule can take centuries to complete. A truncated schedule similar to that suggested in <ref> [ Blake, 1989 ] </ref> , is therefore used. The schedule used is as follows: T i = log (2 + i) where i is the iteration number, and T 0 was chosen to be 4. At each iteration, the algorithm chooses a random pixel in the image to possibly update. <p> At each iteration, the algorithm chooses a random pixel in the image to possibly update. This temperature, T, is shown in the literature <ref> [ Geman and Geman, 1984; Blake, 1989 ] </ref> 3.2. THEORETICAL IMPLEMENTATION 18 to be combined into a Gibbs distribution as follows: P (x) = Z where U (x) is the energy (from clique potentials) of having x set, and Z is a normalizing constant. <p> This process of checking and flipping pixels is repeated until the image no longer changes at all. This DNMRF can also be used for simulated annealing (such as with the Gibbs Sampler of Geman and Geman [ Geman and Geman, 1984 ] , or the heatbath algorithm of Blake <ref> [ Blake, 1989 ] </ref> ) by noting that the ratio Prob (X c ;Y ) Prob (X;Y ) 1 (where 1 T is the temperature term), is the energy ratio.

Reference-contexts: Another class of edge detection algorithms are those based on zero crossings. These usually use the Laplacian operator, and the most well known algorithm is the Laplacian of a Gaussian, developed by Marr and Hildreth [ Marr and Hildreth, 1980 ] . 2.2. EDGE DETECTION 14 Canny's edge detector <ref> [ Canny, 1986 ] </ref> is based on a filter which is optimum for finding step edges in the presence of Gaussian noise. This filter is calculated by convolving the image with a 2-D Gaussian. <p> As well as the DNMRF ICM method, with and without the rotational invariance modification, three other edge detectors were tested on these binary images: the thresholded 4-operator difference of boxes, the thresholded Sobel operator [ Sobel, 1970; Duda and Hart, 1973 ] , and the Canny edge operator 1 <ref> [ Canny, 1986 ] </ref> . (We also tried the Roberts edge detector [ Roberts, 1965; Rosenfeld, 1981 ] , but it proved effectively useless in the presence of noise.) One parameter has to be chosen for the Canny operator: the value of s, the variance of the Gaussian operators used.

Reference-contexts: The images used during testing were random pairs of images, generated as they were needed during the test runs. Each image was corrupted with additive Gaussian noise of standard deviation 16 and then corrupted with JPEG compression down to 1.5 bits per pixel (bpp). A thresholded, thinned Sobel <ref> [ Sobel, 1970; Duda and Hart, 1973 ] </ref> edge detector was run on the set of doubly corrupted images. The DNMRF distribution was trained on the pairs of true edge images and edge images of the corrupted images. An example image can be found in figure 5.4. <p> Examples of these images are shown in figure 6.1. Test sets were generated for each object type (circles and tilted rectangles) consisting of 128 gray scale images. Gaussian noise with standard deviations of 4, 8 and 16 was added to each of the images. A thresholded, thinned Sobel <ref> [ Duda and Hart, 1973 ] </ref> edge detector was run on each gray scale image yielding an edge map. The DNMRF was trained on the pairs of true edge images and Sobel edge maps, at each level of noise. <p> Each image was corrupted with Gaussian noise of standard deviation 16call this set of images G. The clean and noisy images were corrupted with JPEG compression down to 1.5 bits per pixel (bpp)generating sets J and GJ respectively. A thresholded, thinned Sobel <ref> [ Sobel, 1970; Duda and Hart, 1973 ] </ref> edge detector was run on the 3 sets of corrupted 6.5. <p> The corresponding true edges were also generated, and used to verify the results. As well as the DNMRF ICM method, with and without the rotational invariance modification, three other edge detectors were tested on these binary images: the thresholded 4-operator difference of boxes, the thresholded Sobel operator <ref> [ Sobel, 1970; Duda and Hart, 1973 ] </ref> , and the Canny edge operator 1 [ Canny, 1986 ] .

Reference-contexts: His work is similar in goals to that of this thesis. His approach, however, is more indirecthe iterates between sampling probabilities, and generating a field which has similar features to the original, and then sampling again. He does this to deal with inaccurate observations.

Reference-contexts: The number of training images required was studied, both in the simple MRF case, and for DNMRFs (chapter 5). In much of the work a technique of Hancock and Kittler's <ref> [ Hancock and Kittler, 1990c ] </ref> is used to smooth the sampled distributions. Chapter 3 contains a description of the implementation of their technique. Chapter 7 demonstrates a technique whereby the size of the distribution can be reduced by taking rotational invariance into account. <p> However the probabilities of extremely improbable labelings cannot be accurately computed by this method, because the small probabilities dictate an unreasonably large number of test images. This chapter tests a suggestion of Hancock and Kittler <ref> [ Hancock and Kittler, 1990c ] </ref> for supplying the probabilities of such labelings by smoothing the estimated probability density. <p> So most of the probability density function has value zero, and most of the weight in the distribution is on a few 3 fi 3 neighborhoods, particularly the all-zero neighborhood. Hancock and Kittler <ref> [ Hancock and Kittler, 1990c ] </ref> suggested a solution to a similar problem. They want to be able to generate probabilities for arbitrary neighborhood 3.3.

Using distributions smoothed by their technique yields image reconstructions which are visually and statistically superior to images reconstructed using the unsmoothed distributions. <p> Section 3.3 discussed the use of Hancock and Kittler's <ref> [ Hancock and Kittler, 1990c ] </ref> technique to solve the problem of the sampled MRF distribution being sparse, primarily because the set of training image does not contain examples of all possible neighborhood labelings.

Reference-contexts: The objective is to represent the important features of the gray scale 3 fi 3 neighborhood, without having to store all 9 intensity values. Various binarization methods were experimented with or considered, such as an idea of Johnson <ref> [ Johnson, 1991 ] </ref> to use the brightness relative to the center pixel of each neighborhood as a binarization, or using the output of a set of feature detectors on a region of the image. None of these worked. The most successful method that was tried used clustering.

EDGE DETECTION 14 Canny's edge detector [ Canny, 1986 ] is based on a filter which is optimum for finding step edges in the presence of Gaussian noise.

Reference-contexts: Distributions stored as cliques are very compact, and also, by the Hammersley-Clifford theorem [ Besag, 1974 ] , the Markov property is guaranteed to hold. One can convert between clique representation and regular representation in a variety of ways <ref> [ Swain, 1990; Sher et al., 1993 ] </ref> . The system described in this thesis does not use cliques to store the distribution. <p> It is interesting to note that the standard 8-connected neighborhood graph is not chordal. But Swain, too, does not pay much attention to how the original neighborhood probabilities are calculated. Sher et al. <ref> [ Sher et al., 1993 ] </ref> demonstrates another way of converting to and from cliques, by solving an over specified set of linear equations using a pseudoinverse method.

The clean and noisy images were corrupted with JPEG compression down to 1.5 bits per pixel (bpp)generating sets J and GJ respectively. A thresholded, thinned Sobel <ref> [ Sobel, 1970; Duda and Hart, 1973 ] </ref> edge detector was run on the 3 sets of corrupted 6.5. <p> The corresponding true edges were also generated, and used to verify the results. As well as the DNMRF ICM method, with and without the rotational invariance modification, three other edge detectors were tested on these binary images: the thresholded 4-operator difference of boxes, the thresholded Sobel operator <ref> [ Sobel, 1970; Duda and Hart, 1973 ] </ref> , and the Canny edge operator 1 [ Canny, 1986 ] . (We also tried the Roberts edge detector [ Roberts, 1965; Rosenfeld, 1981 ] , but it proved effectively useless in the presence of noise.) One parameter has to be chosen for

Reference-contexts: Distributions stored as cliques are very compact, and also, by the Hammersley-Clifford theorem [ Besag, 1974 ] , the Markov property is guaranteed to hold. One can convert between clique representation and regular representation in a variety of ways <ref> [ Swain, 1990; Sher et al., 1993 ] </ref> . The system described in this thesis does not use cliques to store the distribution. <p> RELAXATION AND BINARY IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION 9 1989 ] , Iterated Conditional Modes (ICM) [ Besag, 1974; Besag, 1986; Geman et al., 1990; Karssemeijer, 1990 ] , Highest Confidence First (HCF) [ Chou, 1987; Swain et al., 1990 ] and various refinements and modifications to parts of these methods, for example <ref> [ Swain, 1990; Sher, 1991b; Johnson et al., 1991 ] </ref> . However, not enough attention has been paid to the methods of deriving the probability density functions of the MRFs. <p> This thesis eliminates that need, by generating the MRF distribution from a set of training images. This thesis does not use clique potentials to define MRFs. However, it is interesting to see how these potentials, and neighborhood probabilities are related. Swain <ref> [ Swain, 1990 ] </ref> studies a method of converting probability density functions in neighborhood probability form into clique potentials. His method is exact for images whose neighborhood structure forms a chordal graph, but is only approximate for other neighborhood structures.

Reference-contexts: Woods et al. [ Woods et al., 1987 ] and Manjunath and Chellappa [ Manjunath and Chellappa, 1991 ] estimate a Gaussian random field using local image statistics. They use Markov models to control how the field parameters can vary over the image. Veijanen <ref> [ Veijanen, 1991 ] </ref> finds the Markov random field parameters by searching for parameters of a field that would generate the same cooccurrence matrix as provided by sample images. His work is similar in goals to that of this thesis.

Reference-contexts: Segmenting such imagery is also important because JPEG is a technique that is becoming more popular, and some way is needed to remove any artifacts that the compression introduces into the segmentation. The JPEG technique for lossy compression was chosen because it is a standardized image compression mechanism <ref> [ Wallace, 1991 ] </ref> . JPEG is an acronym for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the name of the committee that developed the standard. The degree of image compression is usually quite large, but one pays for this in that the compressed image is not identical to the original one.
