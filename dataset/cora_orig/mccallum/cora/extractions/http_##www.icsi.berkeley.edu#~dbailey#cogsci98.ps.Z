Abstract: This paper describes an implemented computational model of lexical development for the case of action verbs. A simulated agent is trained by an informant labeling the agent's actions (here hand motions), and the system learns to both label and carry out similar actions. The verb learning model is placed in the broader context of the NTL project on embodied natural language and its acquisition. Based on experimental results and projections to the full range of early lexemes, a significantly enriched model is proposed and its properties discussed.

Reference-contexts: learn concepts, and organize them into a set of lexical items? For almost a decade, the Neural Theory of Language (NTL) group at ICSI and UC Berkeley has sought computational insight into these questions by asking them of structured connectionist systems, rather than the physical neural systems of the brain <ref> (Feldman et al., 1996) </ref>. The basic questions of neural and cognitive development have been receiving increasing attention from the connectionist perspective. But despite considerable theoretical and modeling work on the acquisition of syntax, there does not appear to be any detailed theory of lexical development comparable to the NTL project.

Reference-contexts: Children develop communication patterns with their parents well before they speak; there are patterns of shared eye movements and other physical and vocal gestures <ref> (Foster, 1990) </ref> that form an obvious possible substrate for the deictic articles this and that. And no parent needs to be told about no.

Reference-contexts: The animal literature contains reports of cells in monkey pre-frontal cortex that fire actively either when the monkey itself carries out a specific action or when it sees another primate carry out a similar action <ref> (Gallese et al., 1996) </ref>. The idea of using x-schemas for execution, inference and recognition might also help with another major shortcoming of Bailey's verb learning paradigm. Bai-ley's system learns only the most concrete embodiment of a word like push. But there is a more general, abstract meaning as well.

Reference-contexts: Alternative models competed in the usual connectionist way to provide the best match for a data stream. There is also some developmental and biological support for this kind of model, often discussed under the rubric of imitation. Despite controversy about the extent to which other animals share this ability <ref> (Hauser, 1996) </ref>, imitation is clearly a crucial aspect of human learning. Children can imitate a limited range of facial expressions just after birth, suggesting a connection between recognizing one of these behaviors and the motor schema for carrying it out.

Reference-contexts: But there is a more general, abstract meaning as well. This might be glossed as moving an object away from a deictic center using force directed through the object. Much of the cognitive linguistics literature is concerned with these general image-schematic <ref> (Lakoff, 1987) </ref> and force-dynamic (Talmy, 1988) semantic representations. In our Bloom data, three of the four verbs of action are the general forms: get, go and open, but these might refer to specific actions; get might refer to a pulling action representable directly in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: We represent x-schemas using an extension of a computational formalism known as Petri nets <ref> (Murata, 1989) </ref>. A Petri net is a bipartite graph containing places (drawn as circles) and transitions (rectangles). Places hold tokens and represent predicates about the world state or internal state. Transitions are the active component.

Reference-contexts: The remainder of the paper outlines some extensions to the x-schema representational framework that address some of these problems and suggests how these additions should significantly extend the range of learnable words. An x-schema simulation environment In recent work <ref> (Narayanan, 1997) </ref>, we have extended the basic x-schema representation to model domain theories, with the same mechanism used for acting and reasoning about actions in a dynamic environment. The basic idea is simple. <p> A simplified simulation of the dropping of an object and the corresponding world simulation, depicted in Figure 2, illustrates the central ideas. On the left of Figure 2, we have an x-schema corresponding to the important control transitions of the underlying Drop x-schema <ref> (Narayanan, 1997) </ref>. On the right are x-schemas corresponding to the agent's simulation of the world. Both the agent's actions and the world's simulated evolution affect the agent's mental state. <p> Results of applying our model to discourse fragments from newspaper stories in international economics show that crucial facts about abstract plans, goals, resources and intent can be expressed by projections from embodied concepts. Further details of this work can be found in <ref> (Narayanan, 1997) </ref>. In the rest of this paper, we show how using and extending this simulation framework helps us overcome some of the limitations outlined earlier and cover a wider range of early child language.
