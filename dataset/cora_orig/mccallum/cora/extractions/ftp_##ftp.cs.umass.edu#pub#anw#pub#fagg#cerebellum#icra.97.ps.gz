Abstract: Biological control systems have long been studied as possible inspiration for the construction of robotic controllers. The cerebellum is known to be involved in the production and learning of smooth, coordinated movements. In this paper, we present a model of cerebellar control of a muscle-actuated, two-link, planar arm. The model learns in a trial-and-error fashion to produce bursts of muscle activity that accurately bring the arm to a specified target. When the cerebellum fails to bring the arm to the target, an extra-cerebellar module performs low-quality corrective movements, from which the cerebellum may update its program. In learning to perform the task, the cerebellum constructs an implicit inverse model of the plant. This model uses a combination of delayed sensory signals and recently-generated motor commands to compute the new output motor signal.

Reference-contexts: These fibers impinge on granule cells, whose axons give rise to parallel fibers (PFs). Through the combination of inputs from multiple classes of mossy fibers and local inhibitory in-terneurons, the granule cells are thought to provide a sparse expansive encoding of the incoming state information <ref> [1] </ref>. In our model, a sparse, expansive encoding is computed by the state encoder (Figure 2) using a CMAC (Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer) [1, 10]. This coding scheme makes use of multiple tilings over the state space. <p> In our model, a sparse, expansive encoding is computed by the state encoder (Figure 2) using a CMAC (Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer) <ref> [1, 10] </ref>. This coding scheme makes use of multiple tilings over the state space. A single tiling partitions the space defined by several state variables (e.g. e , _ e , and ^u 1 ) into discrete, non-overlapping rectangular volumes (tiles). <p> When the system state falls into a particular tile, the tile is given an activation level of 1, and all others within the tiling are set to 0. Like Albus, we imagine that each tile corresponds to a single granule cell <ref> [1] </ref>. Due to the large number of state variables, it is impractical for a single tiling to effectively partition the entire space. Thus, a number of tilings are used in parallel, each making use of different subsets of state variables.

Reference-contexts: Two classes of inputs carry information into the cerebellum: the mossy fibers (MFs) and the climbing fibers (CFs).

Reference-contexts: Studies in cat show that when a limb is passively moved by an external force, CFs fire in response to the proprioceptive inputs from the the limb <ref> [5] </ref>. In addition, the CFs are differentially responsive to the direction of limb movement. During active movements (such as stepping), some CF responses are silenced except at the very end of movement, where certain perturbations are likely to occur (e.g. due to misanticipation of the height of the step).

Reference-contexts: motor commands that are intended to bring Fagg, Sitkoff, Barto, & Houk: Cerebellar Learning for Control of a Two-Link Arm in Muscle Space; ICRA 97 2 attached in such a way that four of them induce torques about single joints; the remaining two simultaneously actuate both joints (Figure adapted from <ref> [7] </ref>). the arm to the specified goal. In cases where the arm does not reach this goal, the static EC module is activated. This module produces a short, constant burst of activity in muscle space that brings the arm closer to the goal. <p> Links 1 and 2 correspond to the upper and lower arm, respectively. The arm parameters, M (mass of each link), L (link length) L g (center of gravity), I (moment of inertia), and Di (joint friction) are adapted from <ref> [7] </ref>. 2.2 Muscle Model The muscles are modeled as visco-elastic (spring) elements, which pull, but do not push. The state of each muscle is a function of its current length (l), the rate of change in length ( _ l), and the muscle rest length, l r (u). <p> In taking advantage of this property, it is not necessary to directly represent joint torques at all. Finally, our model does not make use of reference trajectories, as has been assumed in other models of cerebellar control <ref> [7, 11] </ref>. More specifically, there is little physiological evidence to support the idea that another subsystem provides to the cerebellum a detailed kinematic plan a plan which happens to satisfy certain dynamic optimality criteria.

The memory marks the synapse as being eligible for potential update in the event that later training inputs arrive from the inferior olive.

Reference-contexts: In continuing work, we are expanding our model in several directions. First, individual APGs are no longer constrained to control single muscles. Rather, we have begun experimentation with the more general case, in which the cerebellum performs control in a muscle synergy space <ref> [9] </ref>. Each synergy differentially projects to multiple muscles, thus providing a large repertoire of available movement directions. Second, it has been assumed thus far that target locations are specified in joint space, and that this information is available to the EC system.
