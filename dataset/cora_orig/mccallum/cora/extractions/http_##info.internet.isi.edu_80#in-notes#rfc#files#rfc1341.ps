Title: MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions): Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet Message
Author: N. Freed, Innosoft 
Date: June 1992  
Note: Network Working Group N. Borenstein, Bellcore Request for Comments: 1341  this memo is unlimited. This document does NOT extend Internet mail header fields to permit anything other than US-ASCII text data. It is recognized that such extensions are necessary, and they are the subject of a companion document [RFC -1342]. A table of contents appears at the end of this document. Borenstein Freed [Page i]  
Abstract: RFC 822 defines a message representation protocol which specifies considerable detail about message headers, but which leaves the message content, or message body, as flat ASCII text. This document redefines the format of message bodies to allow multi-part textual and non-textual message bodies to be represented and exchanged without loss of information. This is based on earlier work documented in RFC 934 and RFC 1049, but extends and revises that work. Because RFC 822 said so little about message bodies, this document is largely orthogonal to (rather than a revision of) RFC 822. In particular, this document is designed to provide facilities to include multiple objects in a single message, to represent body text in character sets other than US-ASCII, to represent formatted multi-font text messages, to represent non-textual material such as images and audio fragments, and generally to facilitate later extensions defining new types of Internet mail for use by cooperating mail agents.

Reference-contexts: As such, non-text messages, such as multimedia messages that might include audio or images, are simply not mentioned. Even in the case of text, however, RFC 822 is inadequate for the needs of mail users whose languages require the use of character sets richer than US ASCII <ref> [US-ASCII] </ref>. <p> National use variations of ISO 646 [ISO-646] are NOT ASCII and their use in Internet mail is explicitly discouraged. The omission of the ISO 646 character set is deliberate in this regard. The character set name of "US-ASCII" explicitly refers to ANSI X3.4-1986 <ref> [US-ASCII] </ref> only. The character set name "ASCII" is reserved and must not be used for any purpose. NOTE: RFC 821 explicitly specifies "ASCII", and references an earlier version of the American Standard. <p> The complete US-ASCII character set is listed in <ref> [US-ASCII] </ref>. Note that the control characters including DEL (0-31, 127) have no defined meaning apart from the combination CRLF (ASCII values 13 and 10) indicating a new line. <p> Borenstein & Freed [Page 19] RFC 1341 MIME: Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions June 1992 The defined charset values are: US-ASCII -- as defined in <ref> [US-ASCII] </ref>. ISO-8859-X -- where "X" is to be replaced, as necessary, for the parts of ISO-8859 [ISO-8859]. Note that the ISO 646 character sets have deliberately been omitted in favor of their 8859 replacements, which are the designated character sets for Internet mail.

Reference-contexts: Examples of such encodings currently used in the Internet include pure hexadecimal, uuencode, the 3-in-4 base 64 scheme specified in RFC 1113, the Andrew Toolkit Representation <ref> [ATK] </ref>, and many others. The limitations of RFC 822 mail become even more apparent as gateways are designed to allow for the exchange of mail messages between RFC 822 hosts and X.400 hosts. X.400 [X400] specifies mechanisms for the inclusion of non-textual body parts within electronic mail messages.

Reference-contexts: The subtype names the specific image format. These names are case insensitive. Two initial subtypes are "jpeg" for the JPEG format, JFIF encoding, and "gif" for GIF format <ref> [GIF] </ref>. The list of image subtypes given here is neither exclusive nor exhaustive, and is expected to grow as more types are registered with IANA, as described in Appendix F. 7.6 The Audio Content-Type A Content-Type of "audio" indicates that the body contains audio data.

Reference-contexts: Borenstein & Freed [Page 19] RFC 1341 MIME: Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions June 1992 The defined charset values are: US-ASCII -- as defined in [US-ASCII]. ISO-8859-X -- where "X" is to be replaced, as necessary, for the parts of ISO-8859 <ref> [ISO-8859] </ref>. Note that the ISO 646 character sets have deliberately been omitted in favor of their 8859 replacements, which are the designated character sets for Internet mail. As of the publication of this document, the legitimate values for "X" are the digits 1 through 9.

Reference-contexts: National use variations of ISO 646 <ref> [ISO-646] </ref> are NOT ASCII and their use in Internet mail is explicitly discouraged.

Reference-contexts: The term "video" is used extremely generically, rather than with reference to any particular technology or format, and is not meant to preclude subtypes such as animated drawings encoded compactly. The subtype "mpeg" refers to video coded according to the MPEG standard <ref> [MPEG] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: noting this possibility, there is no specific action to take to prevent this, apart from the timely correction of such bugs if any are found. 7.4.3 The Application/ODA subtype The "ODA" subtype of application is used to indicate that a body contains information encoded according to the Office Document Architecture <ref> [ODA] </ref> standards, using the ODIF representation format. For application/oda, the Content-Type line should also specify an attribute/value pair that indicates the document application profile (DAP), using the key word "profile". Thus an appropriate header field might look like this: Content-Type: application/oda; profile=Q112 Consult the ODA standard [ODA] for further information. <p> the Office Document Architecture <ref> [ODA] </ref> standards, using the ODIF representation format.

Borenstein & Freed [Page 43] RFC 1341 MIME: Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions June 1992 7.5 The Image Content-Type A Content-Type of "image" indicates that the bodycontains an image.

Reference-contexts: It is expected that richer formats for higher quality and/or lower bandwidth audio will be defined by a later document. The content of the "audio/basic" subtype is audio encoded using 8-bit ISDN u-law <ref> [PCM] </ref>. When this subtype is present, a sample rate of 8000 Hz and a single channel is assumed. 7.7 The Video Content-Type A Content-Type of "video" indicates that the body contains a time-varying-picture image, possibly with color and coordinated sound.

It is recommended that Postscript as sent through email should use Postscript document structuring conventions if at all possible, and correctly. The execution of general-purpose PostScript interpreters entails serious security risks, and implementors are discouraged from simply sending PostScript email bodies to "off-the-shelf" interpreters.

Reference-contexts: Its success has been such that the RFC 822 format has been adopted, wholly or partially, well beyond the confines of the Internet and the Internet SMTP transport defined by RFC 821 <ref> [RFC-821] </ref>. As the format has seen wider use, a number of limitations have proven increasingly restrictive for the user community. RFC 822 was intended to specify a format for text messages. As such, non-text messages, such as multimedia messages that might include audio or images, are simply not mentioned.
