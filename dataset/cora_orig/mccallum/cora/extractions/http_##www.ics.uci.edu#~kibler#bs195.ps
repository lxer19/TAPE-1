Title: Plateaus and Plateau Search in Boolean Satisfiability Problems: When to Give Up Searching and Start Again

Abstract: We empirically investigate the properties of the search space and the behavior of hill-climbing search for solving hard, random Boolean satisfiability problems. In these experiments it was frequently observed that rather than attempting to escape from plateaus by extensive search, it was better to completely restart from a new random initial state. The optimum point to terminate search and restart was determined empirically over a range of problem sizes and complexities. The growth rate of the optimum cutoff is faster than linear with the number of features, although the exact growth rate was not determined. Based on these empirical results, a simple run-time heuristic is proposed to determine when to give up searching a plateau and restart. This heuristic closely approximates the empirically determined optimum values over a range of problem sizes and complexities, and consequently allows the search algorithm to automatically adjust its strategy for each particular problem without prior knowledge of the problem's complexity.

Reference-contexts: At 4.25, about half the randomly generated CNF expressions 1 are satisfiable, and few are sufficiently under or over-constrained to permit an easy answer. This property has been observed in a number of AI problems <ref> (Cheesman et al., 1991) </ref>. All of the results presented here are for c/v = 4.25, although limited tests were performed by varying c around that value. Most results are for v = 64, since that was the largest value that could be extensively explored in reasonable time.

Reference-contexts: Consequently the algorithm can immediately terminate if that maximum value is reached. Function maximization is a topic of long-standing interest, and a number of techniques for finding function maxima have been developed over the years, many of which are discussed in Numerical Recipes in C <ref> (Press et al., 1988) </ref>. As summarized there (pg. 290): An extremum (maximum or minimum point) can be either global (truly the highest or lowest function value) or local (the highest or lowest in a finite neighborhood...) Virtually nothing is know about finding global extrema in general.
