Reference-contexts: When a return frame arrives, all frames with lower TO sequence numbers than the frames that were just acknowledged are retransmitted <ref> [1] </ref>. The reason is that frames sent earlier than the ones acknowledged, according to the TO sequence number, are definitely lost due to the in sequence delivery nature of one hop links.

Reference-contexts: A GSM full rate channel supports a user data rate (excluding standard error recovery overhead) of 9.6 Kbps at an average bit error rate of 10 3 <ref> [2] </ref>. The non-transparent service is based on HDLC with 240 bit (30 byte) frames that include a 24 bit error detection CRC. <p> This RLP uses sequence numbers from 0 to 61 and reduces the average bit error rate to 10 8 at the expense of variable throughput and delivery delay jitter due to retransmissions <ref> [2] </ref>. The combination of these delays with the considerable delays caused by the physical layer's error recovery approach can have an adverse effect on TCP timers.

Reference-contexts: Link performance metrics complement handoff notifications in that after a handoff occurs, higher layers or applications can examine this information to determine how they should adapt their behavior. Some proposals do exist for a programming interface that supports the propagation of link layer information to higher layers <ref> [50, 3, 39] </ref>. A link layer based architecture offers many advantages. First, transport 22 layer protocols and applications are shielded from wireless link peculiarities, while enhancing their options for adapting their behavior to network conditions.

Reference-contexts: A final modification is to make the protocol asymmetric so as to reduce the processing load and power requirements of the mobile at the expense of the fixed network end point <ref> [4] </ref>. This can be achieved if all timers are kept and all decisions are made at the base station, and transmissions are minimized from the mobile. Such a scheme marks a burst of frames with a flag at the last frame, serving as a checkpoint. <p> The error or loss probability, for convolutional or block codes, respectively, depends on the code rate and it can be varied to suit both application requirements and transient link behavior. The best aspects of each coding method can be combined in a multi level FEC scheme <ref> [4] </ref>. The physical layer can use convolutional coding with interleaving and soft decoding at the bit level , handing an isochronous stream to the link layer. The link layer in turn can use byte level FEC, either convolutional [37] or block based [4] to correct errors within a frame. <p> be combined in a multi level FEC scheme <ref> [4] </ref>. The physical layer can use convolutional coding with interleaving and soft decoding at the bit level , handing an isochronous stream to the link layer. The link layer in turn can use byte level FEC, either convolutional [37] or block based [4] to correct errors within a frame. Finally, the link or higher layers can use packet level FEC with a block code to combine multiple packets or frames into a loss/error correction scheme.

Reference-contexts: One approach to error recovery then is to split the TCP connection at these pivot points. One instance of TCP executes over each wired part while either another instance of TCP or a special purpose transport layer protocol executes over each wireless part <ref> [51, 5] </ref>. These protocol instances are bridged by a software agent at each pivot point that transforms between the different protocol semantics and formats if required. By isolating each protocol instance over a more homogeneous path, losses at problematic paths do not trigger end-to-end recovery. <p> This coupling between layers is thus required to solve an isolated and localized problem, with more end-to-end fixes needed in the future. Finally, they are only applicable to TCP. Split (or indirect ) TCP approaches <ref> [5, 51] </ref> deal with both mobility and link errors at the same time, but they require modifications both at the endpoints and at the pivot points, which are generally not under user control.

Reference-contexts: Note that if errors were uniformly distributed rather than clustered, the throughput would be 1.51 Mbps, only a 5.5% reduction from the nominal rate. TCP generally performs worse when losses are clustered within one transmission window <ref> [6] </ref>. The scenario above is far from pessimistic. The frame error rate depends on the distance between the hosts and the frame size. Distance is generally imposed by the operating environment, but the frame size can be reduced to minimize the error rate. <p> Whenever multiple losses occur during a single window, something much more likely with larger windows, TCP performance is further reduced. Table 3 shows the performance of TCP over a single hop (LAN) versus a multihop (WAN) path <ref> [6] </ref>, where one edge of the path is a wireless LAN transmitting 1400 byte frames with a frame error rate of about 2.3%, a situation slightly worse than the one described earlier. <p> This is also the case for wireless links that are not at the edges of end-to-end paths, in which case both sides need link layer state information so as to make retransmissions soon enough. This localized recovery approach performs better than split transport layer schemes under wireless link errors <ref> [6] </ref>, proving that local solutions can mitigate the need to modify TCP and violate transport layer semantics. The tight integration between the recovery mechanism and TCP minimizes overhead and avoids conflict between local and end-to-end retransmissions [14], in contrast to link layer RLPs for cellular systems. <p> We thus need a multiprotocol approach to wireless link enhancements. While mobility problems cannot be dealt with at the link layer (whose scope is isolated links), wireless link losses are best recovered from using local mechanisms <ref> [6] </ref>. In addition, higher layers will have to adapt to the medium term link variabilities caused by handoffs to different networks in hierarchical cellular systems. Thus we need to deal with each wireless link problem at the appropriate layer .

Reference-contexts: They are retransmitted if they are not acknowledged within a short period of time or if multiple acknowledgments for previous data are received. TCP data and acknowledgments are detected by having the network layer error recovery module snoop inside all IP datagrams <ref> [7] </ref>. Retransmis-sions are performed by inserting into the TCP stream the buffered IP datagrams, so that the receiver will treat them as if they were end-to-end retransmissions. By leveraging existing TCP messages the protocol avoids the overhead of additional control data exchanges and integration with TCP is simplified. <p> Mobility is dealt with by using a separate mechanism to anticipate handoffs so as to minimize connectivity loss <ref> [7] </ref>. The two endpoints of the wireless link do not have to explicitly reestablish a connection after a handoff since they are independent of each other.

Reference-contexts: For a given host, paths to some hosts may be interference free, while those to others may be currently blocked. To avoid head of line (HOL) blocking effects, wireless hosts should not spend too much time dealing with a problematic host when transmissions to other hosts are queued <ref> [8] </ref>. Fair sharing of the bandwidth in such cases may be achieved by dealing with hosts in a round robin fashion [8]. <p> To avoid head of line (HOL) blocking effects, wireless hosts should not spend too much time dealing with a problematic host when transmissions to other hosts are queued <ref> [8] </ref>. Fair sharing of the bandwidth in such cases may be achieved by dealing with hosts in a round robin fashion [8]. This is not a problem for point to point links where any communication problems equally affect all data. 3.3 Digital Cellular and Cordless Digital cellular systems have many similar characteristics, such as low transmission bandwidths (normally less than 10 Kbps).

Reference-contexts: Note that in shared links if only some users employ link 7 enhancement techniques such as retransmissions, the associated overhead may adversely affect other users <ref> [9] </ref> thus violating fairness goals. Non-transparent services may employ full blown link layer protocols that include features such as error recovery, sequencing and connections handling. Again, use of the non-transparent mode should be optional so as to minimize constraints on protocol design.

Reference-contexts: An ACK implies that all frames with previous sequence numbers have been received correctly, so frames buffered after an error are not acknowledged until they are released to higher layers. The receiver may either repeat the same NAK until the requested frame is received correctly, or use multireject messages <ref> [10] </ref> that report one or more missing frames, to speed up recovery from multiple losses during one roundtrip time. 12 Even though SR schemes only retransmit erroneous frames, if many losses occur the receiver's buffer may fill up with out of sequence frames, causing the sender to either stall or send

Reference-contexts: When data are lost during a handoff, losses are propagated to the transport layer. TCP in particular is tricked into mistaking them for congestion <ref> [11] </ref>. Even if data are not lost but only excessively delayed, TCP may still trigger its congestion recovery procedures and exhibit unnecessarily degraded performance. <p> to this task and then outline an architectural framework that integrates such solutions into a coherent protocol stack that is both flexible and expandable. 5.2 Existing Approaches at the Transport Layer Existing research has analyzed the problems arising when transport layer protocols such as TCP are used over wireless links <ref> [11, 35] </ref>. Losses due to wireless link errors and handoff losses or delays considerably degrade TCP performance due to automatic congestion recovery invocation and end-to-end recovery. <p> To reduce the length of communication pauses after a handoff completes, one approach is to invoke the fast retransmission procedure immediately, rather than after a timeout. To achieve this, signaling from the layer handling mobility is required to notify the transport layer of handoff completion <ref> [11] </ref>. In this approach full congestion recovery procedures are invoked after every handoff, significantly reducing throughput. An alternative scheme attempts to detect whether loss is due to mobility or congestion by exploiting mobility hints from lower layers [35]. <p> Third, TCP is the most popular reliable transport protocol on the Internet, so enhancing its performance will affect the largest number of applications. TCP modifications however are not a panacea. Mobility only approaches <ref> [11, 35] </ref> have the advantage of only modifying the transport layer at the two communicating endpoints, but they do not avoid performance degradation due to other wireless link errors. Although they employ information from the mobility handling layer for their operation, they do not deal with hierarchical cellular systems.

Reference-contexts: Many applications for example can sustain variations in the underlying quality of service by gracefully degrading the service offered to the user <ref> [12] </ref>. These applications could employ network provided performance measurements instead of employing their own heuristic mechanisms to infer it [30]. Similarly, future higher layer protocols that selectively apply enhancement mechanisms depending on the state of the links could employ such information in order to make their choices [28].

Reference-contexts: Since various incompatible wireless LANs already exist, standardization attempts are under way to ensure compatibility over the air between devices supplied by different manufacturers [31]. One proposal is IEEE 802.11 <ref> [13] </ref>, a system very similar, but more advanced than WaveLAN. Even though the standard offers some enhanced services, such as acknowledgments and contention-free transmission (using reservations), it does not offer any additional error recovery mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: As a result, excessive link layer retransmissions, even when they are successful in delivering the data to the receiving end, may still not be completed early enough to avoid TCP timers from expiring <ref> [14] </ref>. Thus, not only the bandwidth underutilization problem will not be solved, but also data will be needlessly retransmitted end-to-end and in particular over the wireless link. <p> The tight integration between the recovery mechanism and TCP minimizes overhead and avoids conflict between local and end-to-end retransmissions <ref> [14] </ref>, in contrast to link layer RLPs for cellular systems. This is achieved by violating protocol layering however, so that layer isolation benefits are lost. The mechanisms employed at the local level have to be modified whenever the corresponding mechanisms of TCP are changed.

Reference-contexts: Depending on the designers of the device and its intended application, the service offered to higher layers may be either a switched circuit (typical in cellular [20] telephony networks), or shared connectionless best effort packet delivery (typical in wireless LANs [31]). CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data) <ref> [15] </ref> is a hybrid offering shared access services over unused circuit switched cellular links. Since new generation telephony networks are digital, data services can be provided without modems and special software, which were required to provide data services over legacy voice networks. <p> Instead of attaching to the Internet via a cellular circuit, asynchronous IP datagram service may be extended all the way to the mobile by sharing the cellular link itself, as in CDPD <ref> [15] </ref>. This service exploits links unused for voice connections, by having CDPD devices use a multi-access protocol to share them. When a mobile acquires the link, it sends a datagram framed and encoded according to the CDPD RLP.

Reference-contexts: Attaching the wireless network to a wired one is possible either using a wireless interface equipped router or a transparent wireless to wired Ethernet bridge. The performance of WaveLAN under IP has been studied and reported in the literature <ref> [16, 17, 38] </ref>. It is quite robust in the presence of external sources of narrowband interference and many obstacles for distances up to 50 meters [16]. Typical error rates in these environments are less than 2.5% for reasonable distances and maximum sized frames. <p> The performance of WaveLAN under IP has been studied and reported in the literature [16, 17, 38].

Typical error rates in these environments are less than 2.5% for reasonable distances and maximum sized frames.

Thus, techniques that recover from errors by exploiting the damaged frames can be used. The raw and uncomplicated Ethernet like interface of WaveLAN is ideal for extension with add-on link layer protocols, as long as bridges are not employed.

By sufficiently separating logical networks in space, WaveLANs may be used to build picocellular in-building networks, even though they were not designed for that purpose <ref> [17] </ref>. The lack of power control results in interference between the cells and questionable performance at the border zones.

Reference-contexts: The datagram is received by an IP router at the provider's premises, which is directly connected to the Internet. Since CDPD is an optional network service targeted to specialized applications we will not deal any further with it in this report. Current cellular systems are either TDMA <ref> [18] </ref> or CDMA [48] based: GSM and IS-54 belong to the former 9 class, while IS-95 belongs to the latter. They all offer circuit mode data services terminating at an IWF, and a non-transparent mode that inserts an RLP between the IWF and the mobile to enhance link performance.

Reference-contexts: Block codes can also be adapted on the fly by generating additional redundant symbols using puncturing. Alternatively, the number of both information and overhead symbols may be varied using shortening <ref> [19] </ref>. The problem is usually how to sense link status in order to appropriately set the overhead transmitted. Adaptation must follow link status closely if enough overhead is to be transmitted but only when required. <p> Using shortening and puncturing we can modify a starting erasure correction block code so as to change both the rate and the block size dynamically <ref> [19] </ref>. The protocol starts with a block size deemed acceptable in terms of delay and uses a systematic code so that the information frames are transmitted first. The block size is chosen to allow feedback to reach the sender before block transmission is completed.

Reference-contexts: Convolutional encoding can be performed very fast in hardware, while decoding, even though considerably harder, can also be performed in hardware by dedicated integrated circuits. It is also possible to adapt the rate of the code during operation within a wide range <ref> [21] </ref>, without any changes to the receiver and transmitter. This enables adaptive operation even with hardware implementations. Depending on the decoder, bits are handed to higher layers either with fixed delay (with Viterbi decoding) or with unpredictable delay due to backtracking (with sequential decoding). <p> In convolutional codes only a subset of the bits may be sent at first and then extra bits may be added for more noisy channels. The encoder/decoder and constraint length are fixed <ref> [21] </ref> while the code is modified using puncturing or repetition [25]. Thus the coding rate varies to accommodate increasing error resiliency. The parameters can only be varied within a range determined by the code, but the design may easily provide for adequate adaptability. <p> The receiver attempts to decode the received frames by using a 1=2 rate code after the first retransmission, a 1=3 rate code after the second, and so on up to 1=N , using all the received frames <ref> [21] </ref>. Using code repetition [26] we can vary with even more flexibility the code rates used. Although these schemes are applicable to all types of ARQ protocols [26], SR schemes are likely to be used due to bandwidth limitations.

Reference-contexts: When such losses occur, indicating high levels of congestion in the network, the best remedy is 2 to reduce the offered traffic so that queues may empty and traffic flow may return to its normal long term average rates <ref> [22] </ref>. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol ), the most popular reliable transport protocol on the Internet today, offers a reliable byte stream service by segmenting the data offered to it by higher protocol layers or applications, placing it into IP datagrams, and recovering from losses by retransmissions. <p> If a particular segment/acknowledgment pair is delayed for a period sufficiently long, a timeout may occur even though a loss has not really occurred. Recent versions of TCP make the key assumption that the vast majority of the perceived losses are due to congestion <ref> [22] </ref>. As a result losses cause, apart from retransmissions, the transmission rate of TCP to be reduced to a minimum and then to be gradually increased so as to probe the network for the highest traffic load that can be sustained without causing congestion. <p> An alternative scheme attempts to detect whether loss is due to mobility or congestion by exploiting mobility hints from lower layers [35]. If the loss is determined to be congestion related, full congestion recovery is invoked, including slow start and congestion avoidance phases <ref> [22] </ref>. If mobility is deemed to be the cause of the loss however, only slow start is invoked, considerably reducing recovery time.

Reference-contexts: Since cellular links are quite slow, header compression <ref> [23] </ref>, commonly used on low bandwidth serial links, may be employed to reduce this overhead to 3-5 bytes per datagram. Note that this reduction is only possible for the specific TCP/IP combination; it is not available even for plain IP.

Reference-contexts: Since higher layer performance can suffer considerably due to errors encountered at the link layer, the protocol may add recovery mechanisms that enhance the perceived quality of the link (non-transparent mode) <ref> [24] </ref>. Wireless LANs normally offer an Ethernet like service so as to ease their integration into existing network environments. Since collision detection is not normally feasible in wireless media, collision avoidance techniques are employed instead. <p> Data services are provided by including in the transmitted frames data handed to the link layer by higher layer protocols rather than by a voice encoder. At the endpoint away from the host the service provider uses an Interworking Function (IWF) <ref> [24] </ref> to convert between the digital frames of the cellular system and whatever is used at the other end of the communications path. <p> If the other endpoint is an ISDN terminal, rate adaptation is performed and data frames are converted appropriately <ref> [24] </ref>. Thus the IWF provides to the subscriber an end-to-end analog or digital circuit abstraction. The lower transmission rates and longer distances compared to wireless LANs mean that the total minimum delivery delay is significantly higher, although due to the lack of contention on the link, it is predictable. <p> Since the IWF hides from the wired network the details of its physical connection with the cellular host, a specialized Radio Link Protocol (RLP) may be employed between the mobile device and the IWF <ref> [24, 27, 37] </ref> to support enhanced IWF and link functionality. To ease communications between the Internet and a mobile host for example, the RLP can offer an IP datagram segmentation and reassembly service between the mobile and the IWF [27].

Reference-contexts: The receiver attempts to decode the received frames by using a 1=2 rate code after the first retransmission, a 1=3 rate code after the second, and so on up to 1=N , using all the received frames [21]. Using code repetition <ref> [26] </ref> we can vary with even more flexibility the code rates used. Although these schemes are applicable to all types of ARQ protocols [26], SR schemes are likely to be used due to bandwidth limitations. <p> Using code repetition <ref> [26] </ref> we can vary with even more flexibility the code rates used.

Reference-contexts: An increased error rate compared to wired links, is not a serious problem for all applications. A frame error rate of 1-2% is a reasonable design goal for voice systems using small frames, since they can withstand such losses with no audible speech degradation <ref> [27] </ref>. Many data applications however, such as file transfer, are only content with zero loss, thus motivating the use of additional error recovery mechanisms. In the Internet model, error recovery has been traditionally provided at the transport layer or higher, for three main reasons. <p> In this case however, the frame header overhead reduces the net available bandwidth significantly. Cellular links designed for voice services are much worse, due to their relatively large (1-2%) frame error rates <ref> [27] </ref> despite a much smaller frame size. An IS-95 link transmitting at full rate, uses fixed size 172 bit data frames, excluding link layer overhead. Since this frame would not fit even the TCP and IP headers, the link layer needs to split IP datagrams into multiple frames. <p> Cellular links operating in circuit mode can leverage the full spectrum of existing link layer protocols, by establishing connections complete with sequence numbers, acknowledgments and retransmissions. For example, IS-54 (TDMA) [37] offers a completely reliable non-transparent mode, while IS-95 (CDMA) <ref> [27] </ref> offers a mostly reliable non-transparent mode, with complete reliability delegated to higher layers. Using local retransmissions, these protocols attempt to recover from losses before they are noticed by higher layers. <p> The outdoor cellular environment is also harsher than the indoor LAN environment, offering more opportunities for interference. These links are optimized for voice communications, so they employ short frames with expected frame loss rates of the order of up to 2% <ref> [27] </ref>. Physical layer design attempts to randomize the observable losses, so that they will not be noticeable to the human ear. <p> Since the IWF hides from the wired network the details of its physical connection with the cellular host, a specialized Radio Link Protocol (RLP) may be employed between the mobile device and the IWF <ref> [24, 27, 37] </ref> to support enhanced IWF and link functionality. To ease communications between the Internet and a mobile host for example, the RLP can offer an IP datagram segmentation and reassembly service between the mobile and the IWF [27]. <p> To ease communications between the Internet and a mobile host for example, the RLP can offer an IP datagram segmentation and reassembly service between the mobile and the IWF <ref> [27] </ref>. Datagrams are then exchanged with the Internet via a router attached to the IWF. With this approach extra modulation and demodulation steps are avoided, connection to the Internet is facilitated and rate adaptation is redundant since IP provides an asynchronous datagram service. <p> Finally, the IS-95 (CDMA) system supports a full rate data link of up to 8.6 Kbps using 172 data bit frames that suffer from a 1-2% frame error rate <ref> [27] </ref>. The frames include a 12 bit error detection CRC, so by adding some headers, including a 0 to 255 sequence number, we get the frames for the IS-95 non-transparent service RLP. <p> However, recovery using the larger logical frames may significantly reduce throughput, so it is preferable to base error recovery on the physical frames <ref> [27] </ref>. If the link layer wants to offer IP datagram encapsulation and transmission services to the network layer, segmentation and reassembly of datagrams must be employed in the short frame cellular systems. <p> One modification used in the IS-95 RLP is to offer only partial recovery and leave to the higher layers the task of recovering from, or even adapting to, pathological loss conditions <ref> [27] </ref>. The motivation for this approach is to avoid local retransmissions for data that are going to be retransmitted end-to-end anyway. Although normally our goal is to do the exact opposite, compatibility with TCP mechanisms forces that tradeoff.

Reference-contexts: This rapidly changing error behavior can best be dealt with by using adaptive mechanisms that can react to environmental changes sufficiently fast. When link behavior varies beyond the recovery capabilities of a given mechanism, higher layer protocols may similarly modify their own recovery strategies <ref> [28] </ref>. Designing an appropriate mechanism to mitigate the problems faced by wireless links is ideally based on a comprehensive set of performance measurements. <p> These applications could employ network provided performance measurements instead of employing their own heuristic mechanisms to infer it [30].

These and other similar systems will be combined in a hierarchical cell structure <ref> [29] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Depending on the designers of the device and its intended application, the service offered to higher layers may be either a switched circuit (typical in cellular [20] telephony networks), or shared connectionless best effort packet delivery (typical in wireless LANs <ref> [31] </ref>). CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data) [15] is a hybrid offering shared access services over unused circuit switched cellular links. Since new generation telephony networks are digital, data services can be provided without modems and special software, which were required to provide data services over legacy voice networks. <p> Since collision detection is not normally feasible in wireless media, collision avoidance techniques are employed instead. To eliminate undetected collisions, one method is to transmit an acknowledgment immediately after a frame is captured <ref> [31] </ref>. If the acknowledgment is withheld not only on collisions but also when a frame is captured but errors are detected in it, the frame may be automatically retransmitted (typically up to a maximum number of times). <p> Since various incompatible wireless LANs already exist, standardization attempts are under way to ensure compatibility over the air between devices supplied by different manufacturers <ref> [31] </ref>. One proposal is IEEE 802.11 [13], a system very similar, but more advanced than WaveLAN. Even though the standard offers some enhanced services, such as acknowledgments and contention-free transmission (using reservations), it does not offer any additional error recovery mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: Techniques employing smoothed past measurements of performance along with current feedback can be used for this purpose [39]. 4.2 Automatic Repeat Request Schemes 4.2.1 Basic ARQ Schemes The first basic category of error and loss recovery schemes is the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) family <ref> [33] </ref>. The basic ARQ concept is that the transmitter sends frames containing a sequence number, and whenever the receiver notices missing or damaged frames it requests their retransmission by the sender. <p> ARQ requires complex protocol processing to be efficient, while FEC requires complex encoding and decoding. ARQ and FEC can also be combined in hybrid schemes <ref> [33] </ref>. Type-I hybrid schemes use an error detecting and correcting byte level FEC code on each frame, increasing the probability of successful recovery of damaged frames. Frames that cannot be corrected are retransmitted.

Reference-contexts: Since these characteristics violate the assumptions that are commonly made for wired media, link layer protocols specialized for satellite links have been developed. These protocols are more sophisticated and complex than the ones used on the wired part of the Internet <ref> [52, 34] </ref>. Since IP, which is the lowest layer protocol that is common across the Internet, can execute on top of any link layer, this solution hides some of the unpleasant characteristics of satellite links from protocol layers above IP. <p> If there is an error though, the two erroneous frames are combined into a single codeword, and the receiver decodes it using the 1=2 rate error recovery code. The advantage of this scheme is that it may recover frames even if both their transmissions are damaged by combining them <ref> [34] </ref>. If decoding fails, the overhead frame is buffered, the original frame is retransmitted, and the procedure described above is repeated. Such type-II schemes offer throughput advantages over pure ARQ schemes as they transmit the same amount of overhead but they also exploit the powerful 1=2 rate code.

Reference-contexts: to this task and then outline an architectural framework that integrates such solutions into a coherent protocol stack that is both flexible and expandable. 5.2 Existing Approaches at the Transport Layer Existing research has analyzed the problems arising when transport layer protocols such as TCP are used over wireless links <ref> [11, 35] </ref>. Losses due to wireless link errors and handoff losses or delays considerably degrade TCP performance due to automatic congestion recovery invocation and end-to-end recovery. <p> In this approach full congestion recovery procedures are invoked after every handoff, significantly reducing throughput. An alternative scheme attempts to detect whether loss is due to mobility or congestion by exploiting mobility hints from lower layers <ref> [35] </ref>. If the loss is determined to be congestion related, full congestion recovery is invoked, including slow start and congestion avoidance phases [22]. If mobility is deemed to be the cause of the loss however, only slow start is invoked, considerably reducing recovery time. <p> Third, TCP is the most popular reliable transport protocol on the Internet, so enhancing its performance will affect the largest number of applications. TCP modifications however are not a panacea. Mobility only approaches <ref> [11, 35] </ref> have the advantage of only modifying the transport layer at the two communicating endpoints, but they do not avoid performance degradation due to other wireless link errors. Although they employ information from the mobility handling layer for their operation, they do not deal with hierarchical cellular systems.

Reference-contexts: Erasures are easier to correct than errors, because we can use the extra location information to build smarter decoders. Codes exist that can correct e erasures and detect (not correct) d additional errors if h d + e, so error detection is directly equivalent to erasure correction <ref> [36] </ref>. Error correction on the other hand requires about double the overhead symbols that are required for the same amount of error detection. Some errors can be naturally treated as erasures. For example, when the delimiting flags of a frame are garbled the whole frame can be lost. <p> Packet level FEC is useful for dealing with longer fades, and is appropriate for systems that discard erroneous frames. Packet level FEC can also be employed in other contexts where either burst losses are expected, such as congestion losses in ATM networks <ref> [36, 44] </ref>, or there is no easy way to determine the receiver's state, such as in multicast transmission [40]. 4.4 Hybrid Schemes Both FEC and ARQ schemes have their advantages and disadvantages.

Reference-contexts: Cellular links operating in circuit mode can leverage the full spectrum of existing link layer protocols, by establishing connections complete with sequence numbers, acknowledgments and retransmissions. For example, IS-54 (TDMA) <ref> [37] </ref> offers a completely reliable non-transparent mode, while IS-95 (CDMA) [27] offers a mostly reliable non-transparent mode, with complete reliability delegated to higher layers. Using local retransmissions, these protocols attempt to recover from losses before they are noticed by higher layers. <p> Since the IWF hides from the wired network the details of its physical connection with the cellular host, a specialized Radio Link Protocol (RLP) may be employed between the mobile device and the IWF <ref> [24, 27, 37] </ref> to support enhanced IWF and link functionality. To ease communications between the Internet and a mobile host for example, the RLP can offer an IP datagram segmentation and reassembly service between the mobile and the IWF [27]. <p> The IS-54 (TDMA) system supports a 9.6 Kbps full rate link (after subtracting the mandatory physical layer error recovery overhead, but including 2 start and stop bits per byte) <ref> [37] </ref>. The non-transparent service uses an RLP considerably more sophisticated than that of GSM, with sequence numbers from 0 to 127 and 16 bit error detection CRCs in each 256 bit frame. Each frame acknowledges positively or negatively multiple sequentially numbered frames to reduce overhead. <p> When a frame is acknowledged as received, all frames transmitted before it and as yet unacknowledged can be safely assumed to be lost <ref> [37] </ref>. The effective user throughput with this scheme ranges between 7.8 and 8.2 Kbps, but the retransmissions can cause unpredictable delays and thus TCP timeouts. <p> This increases the chances of early recovery at the price of using an otherwise idle link, so delay is reduced and throughput is increased without any important penalty <ref> [37] </ref>. However, pre-emptively retransmitted frames may have multiple copies of themselves on the link, so their acknowledgments are ambiguous and thus cannot reveal which packets are definitely lost. <p> The physical layer can use convolutional coding with interleaving and soft decoding at the bit level , handing an isochronous stream to the link layer. The link layer in turn can use byte level FEC, either convolutional <ref> [37] </ref> or block based [4] to correct errors within a frame. Finally, the link or higher layers can use packet level FEC with a block code to combine multiple packets or frames into a loss/error correction scheme.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, these assumptions are disastrous for wireless links. A wireless LAN transmitting UDP packets with 1400 bytes of user payload at 1.6 Mbps over an 85 foot distance has an average frame error rate of 1.55% <ref> [38] </ref>. Each such frame also contains 54 bytes of overhead (8 bytes for the UDP header, 20 bytes for the IP header and 26 bytes for the Ethernet header and trailer). The errors are usually clustered as in congestion losses, but they are much more common. <p> Distance is generally imposed by the operating environment, but the frame size can be reduced to minimize the error rate. Reducing the frame size by 300 bytes in this case, cuts in half the frame error rate <ref> [38] </ref>. On the other hand, the simple framing strategy of one TCP segment mapping to one IP datagram, which is mapped to one wireless LAN frame, requires a constant overhead of 66 bytes per frame (since a minimal TCP header takes 20 bytes).

Given the unpredictability of wireless link behavior, either simulation or gathering and later replaying network traces <ref> [38] </ref> should be employed.

The performance of WaveLAN under IP has been studied and reported in the literature <ref> [16, 17, 38] </ref>. It is quite robust in the presence of external sources of narrowband interference and many obstacles for distances up to 50 meters [16]. Typical error rates in these environments are less than 2.5% for reasonable distances and maximum sized frames.

A link layer based architecture offers many advantages. First, transport 22 layer protocols and applications are shielded from wireless link peculiarities, while enhancing their options for adapting their behavior to network conditions.

Reference-contexts: This approach both guarantees compatibility with existing higher layer protocols and avoids violating any implicit assumptions of these protocols due to design dependencies on wired media. Emerging wireless communications technologies include cellula14r and cordless telephony and wireless LANs (Local Area Networks ) <ref> [41] </ref>. Their error rates are higher than wired media and their bandwidth is limited due to strict frequency spectrum allocations, just as for the satellite case. On the other hand, their propagation delays are similar to those of wired media since they employ terrestrial communications. <p> The CT2 standard supports a raw data rate of 32 Kbps and is mainly promoted for telepoint payphone services, where the mobile device can only originate outgoing connections. An extended version, CT2+, offers full mobility management <ref> [41] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Since mobility management requires the cooperation of more than two hosts, the network layer is the most appropriate layer to deal with it. In contrast, dealing with mobility at the link layer, requires employing escape hatches towards the network layer when wide area mobility is to be offered <ref> [42] </ref>. Mobile IP does not solve the problems of wireless link and handoff induced losses however. The link layer is the most appropriate place to handle link specific problems such as wireless link losses, so that their effects are not seen beyond link boundaries.

Part of the effort required to make the Internet tolerant to wireless links and mobility has been standardized in the form of the Mobile IP extensions <ref> [43] </ref>. These extensions modify IP to handle mobility without changing host addresses. As a result, global connectivity is maintained at the network layer regardless of the underlying media, in a manner mostly transparent to higher layers.

The frame size dictated by the existing link layer may not fit our goals.

Instead of combining the original frame with one overhead frame using a 1=2 rate code, we can use a 1=N rate code and send the original information first followed by up to N 1 overhead frames until decoding succeeds.

Reference-contexts: Link performance metrics complement handoff notifications in that after a handoff occurs, higher layers or applications can examine this information to determine how they should adapt their behavior. Some proposals do exist for a programming interface that supports the propagation of link layer information to higher layers <ref> [50, 3, 39] </ref>. A link layer based architecture offers many advantages. First, transport 22 layer protocols and applications are shielded from wireless link peculiarities, while enhancing their options for adapting their behavior to network conditions.

Reference-contexts: One approach to error recovery then is to split the TCP connection at these pivot points. One instance of TCP executes over each wired part while either another instance of TCP or a special purpose transport layer protocol executes over each wireless part <ref> [51, 5] </ref>. These protocol instances are bridged by a software agent at each pivot point that transforms between the different protocol semantics and formats if required. By isolating each protocol instance over a more homogeneous path, losses at problematic paths do not trigger end-to-end recovery. <p> Even when TCP is used over the wireless links, it can recover faster due to the shorter paths involved. Alternatively, the transport protocol used over the wireless links may employ more appropriate mechanisms such as SR, further enhancing performance <ref> [51] </ref>. Transport protocol semantics with this approach are between pivot points rather than end-to-end, since an acknowledgment does not mean correct reception at the eventual destination, only correct reception at the next pivot point. <p> This coupling between layers is thus required to solve an isolated and localized problem, with more end-to-end fixes needed in the future. Finally, they are only applicable to TCP. Split (or indirect ) TCP approaches <ref> [5, 51] </ref> deal with both mobility and link errors at the same time, but they require modifications both at the endpoints and at the pivot points, which are generally not under user control.

Reference-contexts: Since these characteristics violate the assumptions that are commonly made for wired media, link layer protocols specialized for satellite links have been developed. These protocols are more sophisticated and complex than the ones used on the wired part of the Internet <ref> [52, 34] </ref>. Since IP, which is the lowest layer protocol that is common across the Internet, can execute on top of any link layer, this solution hides some of the unpleasant characteristics of satellite links from protocol layers above IP. <p> In this case if any frames have been transmitted that would not fit in the receiver's buffer, they can be assumed lost and retransmitted immediately in hopes that the receiver will recover from previous losses in the meantime <ref> [52] </ref>. Buffer overflow can also occur when multiple return frames are lost, whether ACK or NAK, since the sender will keep transmitting frames until its buffer is filled, and then stall until a timeout occurs.
