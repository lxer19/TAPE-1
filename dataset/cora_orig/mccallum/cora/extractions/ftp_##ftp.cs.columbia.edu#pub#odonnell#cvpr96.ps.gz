Abstract: We introduce a new solid shape model formulation that includes built-in offsets from a base global component (e.g. an ellipsoid) which are functions of the global component's parameters. The offsets provide two features. First, they help to form an expected model shape which facilitates appropriate model data correspondences. Second, they scale with the base global model to maintain the expected shape even in the presence of large global deformations. We apply this model formulation to the recovery of 3-D cardiac motion from a volunteer dataset of tagged-MR images. The model instance is a variation of the Hybrid Volumetric Ventriculoid (HVV) [5], a deformable thick-walled ellipsoid model resembling the left ventricle (LV) of the heart. A unique aspect of our implementation is the employment of constant volume constraints when recovering the cardiac motion. In addition, we present a novel geodesic-like prismoidal tessellation of the model which provides for more stable fits.

Reference-contexts: The offset vector itself is calculated by evaluating the base global model (Equation 1) at (u off ; v off ; ff off ), and taking the vector difference with the point of attachment (see Figure 3). ing the vector difference between the base global model (Equation <ref> [1] </ref>) evaluated at (u off ; v off ; ff off ) and at the point of attachment, (u attach ; v attach ; ff attach ). radially scaled model with parametric offsets. Note that the overall structure of the model is preserved. <p> All were from the ED phase of the cardiac cycle. Two contained short-axis information and one, long axis. Some minor editing of the fit was necessary. The results are shown in Figure 10. 6.3 Tagged MR Recovery We applied the default model to segmented tag intersections <ref> [1] </ref> extracted from long and short axis images. All images were acquired on a Siemens MAG-NETOM Vision 1.5 T MRI system with a standard 25 mT/m gradient system. An ECG triggered 2-D gradient echo cine pulse sequence with velocity compensation was utilized.

Reference-contexts: Our final contribution involves the tessellation of this model. The model is described by discrete nodes linearly interpolated to form prismoidal elements. To provide high stability, we arrange these elements in a unique configuration based on the geodesic dome developed by R. Buckminster Fuller <ref> [2] </ref>. The model is demonstrated fitting to segmented tagged-MR image data. of the 3-D LV motion. As a form of hybrid model, global models with parametric offsets have a twofold goal in recovery.

Reference-contexts: While there is a clear distinction between global and offset components in this model, it differs from our current approach in that the offsets are not parametric. In addition, the model fitting was influenced via an inter-nodal stretching penalty as opposed to our current constant volume constraint. O'Dell <ref> [4] </ref> recovered 3-D cardiac motion using a prolate spheroidal model. The coefficients of their series expansion do not, however, give an intuition as to the shape and movement of the LV.

Reference-contexts: This is made possible through "displacements" from a globally scalable default shape. Our model form is distinguished by the incorporation of scalable (parametric) offsets in the default shape. We invoke an instance of this formulation which is a variation of the Hybrid Volumetric Ventriculoid (HVV) <ref> [5] </ref>, a model for recovering shape and motion from tagged-MR data sets. In standard MR, the deforming heart tissue appears homogeneous. This absence of landmarks prevents the recovery of motion within the myocardium. Advances in magnetic resonance imaging have resulted in a form of non-invasive tagging (e.g. <p> Due to the general sparsity of data, we impose a constraint for model elements to maintain a relatively constant volume during fitting. For the cardiac domain, we believe that constant volume constraints are more appropriate than minimal inter-nodal stretching constraints <ref> [5] </ref>, which attempt to maintain initial element edge lengths. While the constant volume constraint itself is not novel [11], we believe we are the first to apply it to cardiac motion recovery from image data. <p> Unlike Pent-land's model, the underlying superquadric as well as the spline mesh deformed to fit the data. Park, Metaxas and Young developed a thick ellipsoidal model for recovering 3-D cardiac motion from tagged-MR data [6]. Their model, developed independently and in parallel with <ref> [5] </ref>, provided a piecewise plot of the change in relevant global LV characteristics. This model, however, does not report strain and is recovered under the unrealistic assumption that the tag columns remain straight over the cardiac cycle. Their model formulation differs from ours in the following ways. <p> LV. Third, their model does not provide a concise description of the LV movement. Rather, piecewise plots describe the motion. Fourth, their model assumes a dense tag acquisition and therefore makes no use of "regularizing" constraints. O'Donnell, Gupta, and Boult presented a thick su-perelliptic model, the HVV, in <ref> [5] </ref>. While there is a clear distinction between global and offset components in this model, it differs from our current approach in that the offsets are not parametric. In addition, the model fitting was influenced via an inter-nodal stretching penalty as opposed to our current constant volume constraint. <p> The overall structure looks natural since the offsets adjust to the new base component shape. Bottom Right: globally twisted model with non-parametric offsets. The offsets do not adjust to the new global component configuration. 3.2.1 Parametric vs Non-Parametric Offsets We introduced non-parametric offsets to the hybrid modeling paradigm in <ref> [5] </ref>. Since the non-parametric offsets do not scale, the default shape may become extremely distorted as the base global model deforms (see Figure 4). Note that the scaling demonstrated in this figure could have been implemented as a simple uniform scaling of space. <p> And, the distribution of elements with nodes is guaranteed to be smooth. The result is a structurally sound model. Our tessellation differs from other geodesics in that it is designed for a thick-walled ellipsoid model. Our new tessellation has significant advantages over the so-called sealed tube approach <ref> [13, 7, 3, 5] </ref> in which several model elements may meet at a single node (see figure 6). In the sealed tube approach there is no inherent bound on the number of elements associated with the apex node. <p> This duration in general is thought to be unacceptable [10]. In order to estimate the motion with less data, some form of "regularization" must be imposed on the model. 4.1 Minimal Stretching Constraint The minimal stretching constraint <ref> [5] </ref> encourages smooth deformations from an initial shape by attempting to maintain inter-nodal distances. It may be used with volumetric as well as planar surface elements. We choose to employ it only on the surface of the model in order to recover a smooth shape. <p> We wish to calculate internal strain in the heart as well as recover some of the global characteristics of its movement. Recovery takes place over two main stages. For details see <ref> [5] </ref>. 5.1 Default Model Recovery Prior to the recovery from a specific dataset a default model must be created. This may be done by fitting the base global model to a set of contour data and allowing the parametric offsets to deform. <p> In addition, we show the recovery of 3-D cardiac motion from tagged-MR data using the constant volume constraints on our global model with parametric offsets (the HVV). 6.1 Tessellation Experiments We tested the stability of our new tessellation by comparing it with the sealed tube tessellation found in <ref> [5] </ref>. The outer walls of both models were fit to a densely sampled (121 datapoints) thick hemisphere 20% larger in size. Fitting was done with the minimal volumetric stretching constraint set to an extremely high degree (k s = 10)), guaranteeing breakage. Table 6.1 shows the results.

Reference-contexts: This implies a strong confidence in the expected shape. Similarly, the final fit can be made to virtually interpolate the data via a low deformation penalty. This is appropriate in the case that the default model has little certainty associated with it <ref> [12] </ref>. 5 Recovery Procedure The goal of our recovery as stated in the introduction is two-fold. We wish to calculate internal strain in the heart as well as recover some of the global characteristics of its movement. Recovery takes place over two main stages.

Reference-contexts: By tracking the tag grid intersection points over time, we can extract a 2-D projection of the true 3-D motion. To estimate 3-D cardiac motion, we fuse acquisitions of the same heart taken from different views (usually orthogonal) registered in time using a model-based approach <ref> [15] </ref>. Due to the general sparsity of data, we impose a constraint for model elements to maintain a relatively constant volume during fitting. For the cardiac domain, we believe that constant volume constraints are more appropriate than minimal inter-nodal stretching constraints [5], which attempt to maintain initial element edge lengths.
