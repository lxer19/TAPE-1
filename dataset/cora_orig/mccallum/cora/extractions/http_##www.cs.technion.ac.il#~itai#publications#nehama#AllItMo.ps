Abstract: 6. An Open Problem. We have shown that in the distributed model for every schedule S Note that we can only state that for every schedule S there exists a deterministic algorithm A(S) such that distribution-cost(A(S); S; P ) randomized-cost T (S). It remains an open question whether there exists a single deterministic algorithm for which for all schedules S the inequality holds. I.e., while we have shown that However, as we have seen in Section 4, our results are sufficient to show nontrivial [1] D.
