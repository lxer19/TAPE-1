Reference-contexts: Listening and working closely with the customer is essential to successful technology transfer. This often involves a physical collocation of people. The following are two quotes that appear to be true in TT: (1) "Technology transfer is people transfer"; (2) "Collaboration is technology transfer" <ref> [1] </ref>. * Management of customer expectations. Many TT failures are caused by unfulfilled expectations. Managing customer's expectations represents one of the main challenges for successful TT. Often, what the producer of the technology delivers is not what its consumer expects. <p> We have had some TT successes, but a significant amount of work still remains to fulfill our vision. 3 Fishman's View Over the period December 1984 through November 1989, HP Labs engaged in the research and prototyping of a next-generation, object-oriented DBMS, called Iris <ref> [1] </ref>, that was being designed to meet the needs of commercial applications.

Reference-contexts: In the context of the TI Open OODB project, our group participated in the ANSI X3 OODB Task Group whose purpose was to develop a characterization of 1 OODB technology. The final report of this group, characterized OODBs as a collection of independent services <ref> [2] </ref>. The report was co-authored by several key researchers and developers in industry which represented a form of initial consensus from the small number of companies involved in this effort. <p> Transfer of the Iris technology from HPL to the recipient HP product division began in 1989 and resulted in the product release of OpenODB <ref> [2] </ref> in November, 1991. We will refer to this transfer division as the Database Division (DBD). In reality, the transfer division went through a number of organization changes, and each time was identified by a different name.

Reference-contexts: This report was widely circulated in industry and eventually served as one of the inputs to the Object Management Group, influencing the specification of its current Object Services Architecture <ref> [3] </ref>. It also served as a basis for the creation of a new ANSI committee, X3H7, whose current objective is the formulation of a reference object model that can enable the convergence of many object models currently being developed independently.
