Title: Minimizing Power Dissipation in Combinational Circuits During Test Application  
Abstract: V. P. Dabholkar S. Chakravarty Department of Computer Science State University of New York Buffalo, NY 14260 TECH REPORT NO 94-10 Abstract Yield, Reliability and Power Supply considerations motivate the need to minimize power dissipation during test application. Two techniques for minimizing power dissipation when tests are applied to static CMOS combinational circuits are proposed. They are: (i) Test set ordering; and (ii) Repetition of test vectors. We show that: although (i) is NP-Hard good heuristics can be developed; and an optimal polynomial time algorithm exists for (ii). Experimental evaluation of these algorithms show that considerable improvement in power dissipation can be achieved using these techniques.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Growing size of VLSI circuits, along with the high transistor density, is making minimization of power dissipation an important issue in VLSI design. Power dissipation issues have been addressed at various stages of circuit design like synthesis <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, technology mapping [3, 4] etc. Power dissipation issue must also be addressed during testing. Circuits are often designed to operate in two modes: normal mode; and test mode. <p> However, our result show that selecting such vectors is computationally very difficult. Experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms and techniques are presented. Two measures of power dissipation, viz. worst case (or peak) power dissipation [9, 10, 11] and average power dissipation <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, were considered. Power dissipation is a function of the circuit delay. Three delay models have been studied in the literature [9] viz. unit delay, zero delay and general delay. Zero delay gives the least number of transitions while the general delay model gives the worst case transitions.

Reference-contexts: In Section 9 we present the results on repetition of test vectors. In Section 10 we consider the problem of adding new vectors to the test set to reduce power dissipation. 2 Power Dissipation Model Two components of power dissipated in CMOS circuits are <ref> [12] </ref>: Static power dissipation due to leakage current or other current drawn continuously from the power supply (P st ); and Dynamic power dissipation. <p> In general, because of gate delays, this will not happen. Thus, the time for which all the inputs of a gate change such that the pull-up and pull-down networks are on is very small, if at all it is nonzero. So for all further discussions, following <ref> [12] </ref>, P total is assumed to be given by: P total = 1=2 fi C fi V 2 DD fi N G fi f (1) Equation (1) implies that power is dissipated at a node when the input vector is changed from T i to T i+1 .

Reference-contexts: The algorithm selects following edges f (B; C); (C; D); (D; E)g then it drops f (E; C), (D; A), (E; B), (A; C)g and selects f (A; E)g. The hamiltonian path obtained is shown in Figure 5 (b). For our experiments we used ISCAS85 circuits <ref> [14] </ref> and stuck-at test vectors for each circuit, generated using the stuck-at generator provided with Octtools [15]. Then we resequenced the test vectors using heuristic GET PEAK and compared the peak power dissipation of the later sequence with the power disspation of the original sequence.

Computation of power dissipation for a sequence of vectors needs knowledge of output load capacitance of each gate of the network.

Reference-contexts: The experiments were run on SPARC-II workstations. Timings varied from a few seconds to 25 minutes for the largest circuit. 8 Minimizing Total Power We use CHRFD TOTAL, described below, for computing good input vector sequence such that total power dissipation is minimized <ref> [16] </ref>. Before we introduce the heuristic, some related concepts are explained. Given a graph containing an even number of nodes, a matching is collection of edges M such that each node is the endpoint of exactly one edge in M . <p> The inequality holds when w l (i; k) is zero. Thus, w l (i; j) + w l (j; k) w l (i; k) 8l 2 C l2C X C l fi w l (i; k) 8l 2 C 2 &gt;From Lemma 8.1 and the analysis of <ref> [16] </ref>, we get the following result. Corollary 8.1 For zero delay model, total power dissipation for the sequence of vectors obtained by using CHRFD TOTAL, is at most 1.5 times the optimal total power dissipation. Note that such a guarantee does not hold for general delay model.

Reference-contexts: A minimum weight matching is one for which the sum of edge weights is minimum. Such matchings can be found in time O (n 3 ) where n is number of nodes of the graph <ref> [17] </ref>. An Eulerian graph is a graph in which all the vertices have even degree. Such a graph can be traversed by traversing each edge exactly once. A hamiltonian tour can be obtained from an eulerian tour by using shortcuts.
