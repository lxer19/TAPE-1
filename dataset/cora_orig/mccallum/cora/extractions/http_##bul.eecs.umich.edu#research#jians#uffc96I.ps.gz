Abstract: A new approach to ultrasound imaging with coded-excitation is presented. Imaging is performed by reconstruction of the scatterer strength on an assumed grid covering the region of interest (ROI). Our formulation is based on an assumed discretized signal model which represents the received sampled data vector as a superposition of impulse responses of all scatterers in the ROI. The reconstruction operator is derived from the pseudoinverse of the linear operator (system matrix) that produces the received data vector. The singular value decomposition (SVD) method with appropriate regularization techniques are used for obtaining a robust realization of the pseudoinverse. Under simplifying (but realistic) assumptions, the pseudoinverse operator (P IO) can be implemented using a bank of transversal filters, with each filter designed to extract echoes from a specified image line. This approach allows for simultaneous acquisition of a large number of image lines. This could be useful in increasing frame rates for 2D imaging systems or allowing for real-time implementation of 3D imaging systems. When compared to the matched filtering approach to similar coded-excitation systems, our approach eliminates correlation artifacts that are known to plague such systems. Furthermore, the lateral resolution of the new system can exceed the diffraction limit imposed on conventional imaging systems utilizing delay-and-sum beamformers. The range resolution is compared to that of conventional pulse-echo systems with resolution enhancement (our P IO behaves as a pseudoinverse Wiener filter in the range direction.) Both simulation and experimental verification of these statements are given in this paper. In part II of this paper, we

Reference-contexts: While this result does not show the resolution limit of the new system (see our companion paper <ref> [20] </ref>), it clearly demonstrates that the new approach offers much higher resolution than the conventional imaging system, i.e., it is not subject to the diffraction limit imposed on conventional systems. <p> This problem and our solution (based on the P IO design) is thoroughly discussed in the companion paper <ref> [20] </ref>. In summary, we have presented a new approach to the coded-excitation imaging problem which results in a minimum-norm least-square error reconstruction of scatterer strength on an assumed grid in the ROI. The new approach eliminates 18 correlation artifacts experienced in matched-filter reconstruction approaches.
