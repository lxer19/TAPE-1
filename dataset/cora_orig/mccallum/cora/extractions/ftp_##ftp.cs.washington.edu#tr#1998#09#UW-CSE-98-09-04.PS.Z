Abstract: A set of guiding principles is stated for the development of standards for representing student educational assessment information. Unlike traditional academic transcripts, the items in portfolios, subjective written evaluations, self-assessments, and computer-based records of activity are complex representations of student achievement, involvement, or inclinations. Even more so than traditional grades, they depend upon a great deal of contextual information in order to be intepreted in useful and reliable ways. This paper also identifies the essential informational components of alternative assessment records and suggests a standard form for their representation. The consideration of evidence, judgment, context, and justification, as described in this paper, is relevant to the improvement of conventional (e.g., multiple-choice test) assessment methodologies, as well.
