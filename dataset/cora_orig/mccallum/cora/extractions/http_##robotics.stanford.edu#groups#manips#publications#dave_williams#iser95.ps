Abstract: Torque control is an effective technique for improving robot performance. However, most conventional robots are not equipped with torque sensors, and they are difficult to add without modifying the robot's mechanical structure. To address this problem, we have developed a new method that allows torque feedback to be implemented in the absence of joint-torque sensors. This technique estimates the torque components acting in the force-control subspace, using a conventional wrist force sensor. We have implemented and experimentally validated this approach using a PUMA 560 manipulator. Our results confirm the effectiveness of this method in dealing with the limitations of conventional actuation/transmission systems.

Reference-contexts: The large amount of extra phase in the experimental results is due to static and coulomb friction acting at the motor. This friction is a function of joint position, and can exhibit very high spatial frequencies <ref> [1] </ref>. As a consequence, large controller disturbances due to friction will occur over a broad range of frequencies. To compensate for the large steady-state component of this friction, we need a torque controller with very Flexibility for Joint Three high DC gain.

Reference-contexts: Our approach to torque feedback is to estimate and control only those torques that correspond to the constrained subspace. This estimate is obtained by a projection of the force sensor output into the force-control durections using the generalized selection matrix <ref> [3] </ref> F sens = F sens : (2) Equation 2 gives only the sensed forces due to contact. Since is a part of the task specification, these forces are easy to calculate.

Reference-contexts: Another important reason to examine all six relationships in Equation 9 is that one of them has a special property. The transfer function relating n o to y is called a disturbance sensitivity transfer function. Bode's integral theorem <ref> [4] </ref> states that, in order for the closed-loop system to be stable, this transfer function must satisfy the property Z 1 ln fi fi P (!)K (!) fi fi d! = 0: (10) Equation 10 implies that, in order to reject disturbances at some frequencies, they must be amplified at other
