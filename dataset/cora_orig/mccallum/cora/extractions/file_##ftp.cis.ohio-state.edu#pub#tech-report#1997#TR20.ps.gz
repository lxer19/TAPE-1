Abstract: Multidestination message passing has been proposed as a mechanism to achieve efficient multicast in regular direct and indirect networks. The application of this technique to parallel systems based on irregular networks has, however, not been studied. In this paper we propose two schemes for performing multicast using multidestination worms on irregular networks and examine the extent to which multidestination message passing can improve multicast performance. For each of the schemes we propose solutions for the associated problems such as, methods for encoding and decoding multidestination headers, alterations to the setup algorithm run by the switches, logic to perform header manipulation, etc. We perform extensive simulations to evaluate our schemes under a variety of changing parameters: software startup overhead per message, system size, switch size, message length and degree of connectivity. Our results establish that even a very naive multicasting algorithm using multidestination message passing can result in considerable performance gains over the best unicast based multicasting schemes.

Reference-contexts: To perform communication with low latency these systems typically use cut-through switching (routing) due to its inherent advantages like low latency and reduced communication hardware overhead. A lot of the recent research has focussed on the problem of deadlock free cut-through routing in irregular networks of workstations <ref> [1, 10, 11] </ref>. It has been established that efficient multicast is crucial to the operation of a parallel system. This is because multicast, in addition to being used in other collective operations, is also used in system level operations such as for cache-invalidations in a Distributed Shared Memory system [4]. <p> The number of ports that are left unconnected is varied to obtain networks that are increasingly better connected. 2.2 Unicast Routing in Irregular Networks Recently, a number of approaches have been proposed for routing packets in irregular networks <ref> [1, 10, 11, 12] </ref>. An important issue in networks with cut-through routing is the avoidance of deadlock due to cyclic waiting among packets. <p> An important issue in networks with cut-through routing is the avoidance of deadlock due to cyclic waiting among packets. Each of the proposed routing solutions tries to address this deadlock problem either by eliminating the possibility of cyclic wait <ref> [1, 10, 11] </ref> or by allowing cycles but by providing paths for messages to escape from cyclic wait scenarios [10, 12]. For the purposes of this paper however, we will adopt the approach outlined in [11]. This approach, called up*/down* routing, is described next. <p> We are currently studying enhancements to the naive multicasting algorithm used in the MPM-SSR scheme that work towards reducing network contention. We are also examining whether these schemes can make better use of higher 14 network connectivities when used in conjunction with other routing algorithms (such as those of <ref> [1, 10, 12] </ref>).

An efficient, single phase multicasting scheme using such a multidestination worm with a bit-string encoded header has been proposed in [9, 15]. Key to the efficient implementation of this multicast is the presence of reachability strings at each of the network switches.

This is because multicast, in addition to being used in other collective operations, is also used in system level operations such as for cache-invalidations in a Distributed Shared Memory system <ref> [4] </ref>. Both systems using the Distributed Memory, and systems using the Distributed Shared Memory programming paradigms, make use of multicast/broadcast for various application and system level data distribution functions. A lot of research has therefore focussed on methods for efficient multicast in parallel systems.

Reference-contexts: Since each of the phases already involves the high overhead of a software communication startup, the various software multicasting schemes focus on reducing or eliminating contention among the worms in a phase of the algorithm. Such unicast based multicasting schemes have also been recently proposed for irregular networks <ref> [5] </ref>. Multidestination routing has been proposed for parallel systems based on regular networks. Originally proposed for direct (router-based) networks [2, 6, 8], this scheme has been recently extended to regular switch-based parallel systems [13, 15]. <p> Such an approach will require fewer phases to cover a given multicast destination set than the number of phases required by the best known software multicasting algorithm <ref> [5] </ref> if p 2. If p = 1 then the number of phases required for multicast is equal to the number of phases in the best known software multicasting algorithm. <p> As shown in <ref> [5] </ref>, contention free unicast based multicast is not always possible in irregular networks. Furthermore, messages may pass through multiple switches and links, so that the propagation cost of these messages may be higher.

Reference-contexts: Under this scheme the switches in the network must store enough routing information to decide the output ports that must receive a copy for the worm to reach all its destinations. 3.2 Replication Mechanism Multidestination routing in switch based parallel systems requires an efficient replication mechanism at the switches <ref> [7] </ref>. In this paper, we assume that switches adopt the deadlock-free input-buffer-based asynchronous replication mechanism of [15]. Under such a replication mechanism an arriving multidestination worm at an input buffer of a switch is read by multiple output ports.

Reference-contexts: A lot of research has therefore focussed on methods for efficient multicast in parallel systems. These methods have predominantly been proposed for regular networks and fall into two broad categories: unicast-based and multidestination-based multicast. Unicast based multicast typically follows a multi-phase binomial tree based approach <ref> [16] </ref>. A unicast message is sent by the source to a destination in the first phase of this multicast. In every successive phase, the source and the multicast destinations covered up to the beginning of that phase send one message each to one of the remaining destinations.
