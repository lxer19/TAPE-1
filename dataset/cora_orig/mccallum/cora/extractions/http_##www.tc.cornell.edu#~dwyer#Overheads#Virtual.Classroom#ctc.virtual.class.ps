Abstract: The World Wide Web provides new opportunities for distance education over the Internet. The Web, when combined with other network tools, can be used to create a virtual classroom to bring together a community of learners for interactive education. The Cornell Theory Center, a national center for high performance computing, is investigating the use of emerging network technologies for training computational scientists and researchers in the concepts of parallel processing. This effort is being built on electronic educational materials already on the Web and will evaluate the effectiveness of various collaborative tools. Keywords:

Reference-contexts: The Web solves some problems of traditional distance education and brings new issues to the forefront (Perron, 1994; Hurley, Marshall, McIntosh-Smith & Stephens, 1994). A leading effort in exploring this emerging world is the Global Network Academy <ref> (Butts, Reilly, Speh & Wang, 1994) </ref>. The Theory Center will face a number of similar issues, but will also have some unique situations related to our field of instruction and the network-sophistication of our intended audience. Some of the issues addressed for our pilot course follow.

Reference-contexts: The ability to use video teleconferencing could enhance electronic courses not only by transferring these more subtle forms of communication, but also by providing additional visual and audio cues which help the instructor and students to form an informal rapport. Work on the MBONE (Kumar, 1994) and with CUSeeMe <ref> (Cogger, 1994) </ref> have much potential in this area. The pencil: One of the most basic visualization tools used in a classroom is the simple pencil. The student uses the pencil to take notes on what is spoken. The instructor will use the pencil to jot down suggestions for future presentations.

Reference-contexts: Even the annotation capability with the NCSA Mosaic browser is limited by the limitation of annotation only at the full page level, and by the user interface to annotations. We will investigate the CoNote annotation system <ref> (Davis & Huttenlocher, 1994) </ref>. The creation and use of audio-visual tools is still problematic. The same functionality or at least interoperability must be available across all popular graphical user interfaces (i.e., the Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, and the X Window System).

Reference-contexts: For some types of courses a multi-user, text-based virtual reality, also known as a MUD (Multi-User Domain) or MOO (Multi-user domain Object Oriented), might be effective. An example of an experiment in this area is the Diversity University <ref> (Dinsdale, 1994) </ref>. Video teleconferencing: If you were watching a chemist describe the intricacies of a folded protein molecule and its interaction with a drug, chances are much information would be transferred through the hand motions and vocal inflections of the chemist.

Reference-contexts: Student motivation is critical. On-line instructors may need to take more time for the electronic course. Limits to the number of students may be required to maintain quality interaction. While generalizations in the effectiveness of distance education are dangerous, a common set of advantages and disadvantages are emerging <ref> (Rossman, 1992) </ref>.
