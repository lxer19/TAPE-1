Abstract: We show how to compute exact cumulants of two-sample linear rank statistics. In order to approximate tail-probabilities of these statistics, we consider Edgeworth expansions using these exact cumulants instead of asymptotic cumulants. Finally, we use exact tail-probabilities to show that in several cases Edgeworth expansions with exact cumulants provides a significantly better approximation than other existing methods.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we hope to improve the approximations by using the exact cumulants of the test statistics. For one special case, the Wilcoxon statistic, this was done before in [6]. Closed formulas for higher moments and cumulants were derived for this statistic (see <ref> [3] </ref>) as well as for the Freund-Ansari-Bradley statistic (see [13]). These statistics have one-dimensional probability generating functions and these generating functions are used to find closed formulas. No one-dimensional probability generating function is known for arbitrary two-sample linear rank statistics. <p> The method is very suitable for implementation in a computer algebra package like Mathematica, because it involves symbolic computation. The first step is to compute the factorial moments of T m;n . We extend the method used in <ref> [3] </ref> for computing (factorial) moments with the one-dimensional probability generating function of the Wilcoxon statistic to our two-dimensional case. The coefficient of y m in H T m;n (x; y), denoted by H T m;n (x; y)[y m ], is obviously the one-dimensional probability generating function of T m;n .

Reference-contexts: However, there exists a two-dimensional generating function for arbitrary two-sample linear rank statistics. We use this to for computing exact cumulants. Because of the required symbolic computations we implemented the method in the computer algebra system Mathematica. We refer to <ref> [8] </ref> for a survey of computer algebra in statistics. We compare various methods for computing tail-probabilities (exact, Edgeworth approximation with exact cumulants, Edgeworth approximation with approximated cumulants and standard nor 1 mal approximation) on the base of accuracy and computing time.

Reference-contexts: + 15y: 5 Criteria for utility Each method for computing tail-probabilities under the null-hypothesis should be judged on the following two criteria 1. the accuracy of that method 2. the computing time that is needed using that method The first criterion is of course best satisfied by exact methods (see <ref> [9] </ref> or [12]), however they are often very time consuming for larger sample sizes. How much computing time is needed depends on the rank scores. If one uses scores that are in general non-rational (e.g. normal scores), computing times increase quickly when the total sample size N grows. <p> We refer to [6] for the results on the Wilcoxon statistic with untied scores. We computed exact critical values and tail-probabilities of the test statistics (see <ref> [9] </ref> or [12]) for significance levels ff = 1% and ff = 5% and for various sample sizes. For these critical values we compute approximate tail-probabilities with the approximation formulas.
