Abstract: Statistical methods for automatically identifying dependent word pairs (i.e. dependent bigrams) in a corpus of natural language text have traditionally been performed using asymptotic tests of significance. This paper suggests that Fisher's exact test is a more appropriate test due to the skewed and sparse data samples typical of this problem. Both theoretical and experimental comparisons between Fisher's exact test and a variety of asymptotic tests (the t-test, Pearson's chi-square test, and Likelihood-ratio chi-square test) are presented. These comparisons show that Fisher's exact test is more reliable in identifying dependent word pairs. The usefulness of Fisher's exact test extends to other problems in statistical natural language processing as skewed and sparse data appears to be the rule in natural language. The experiment presented in this paper was performed using PROC FREQ of the SAS System.

Reference-contexts: When the variance of the population is unknown and the sample size is large, standard statistical techniques allow that the population variance can be estimated by the sample variance (s 2 ) which is in turn scaled by the sample size (n). t = q n <ref> (Church et al. 1991) </ref> show how the t-statistic can be used to identify dependent bigrams. The data sample is produced through a series of Bernoulli trials that record the presence or absence of a single bigram. <p> This approach to assigning significance is based on the assumption that the sample means are normally distributed. This assumption is shown to be inappropriate for bigram data in (Dunning 1993). The formulation of <ref> (Church et al. 1991) </ref> is equivalent to a one-sample t-test. PROC TTEST of the SAS System computes a two sample t-test and was not used to compute the t-statistic values.

Reference-contexts: sample hold (Read and Cressie 1988): 1. the sample size is large, 2. the number of cells in the contingency table representation of the data is fixed and small relative to the sample size, and 3. the expected count (under the hypothetical popula tion model) for each cell is large. <ref> (Dunning 1993) </ref> shows that G 2 holds more closely to the 2 distribution than does X 2 when dealing with bigram data. <p> This approach to assigning significance is based on the assumption that the sample means are normally distributed.

This confirms the observation made by <ref> (Dunning 1993) </ref> that G 2 tends to overstate independence. This indicates that the asymptotic approximation of G 2 by the 2 distribution is breaking down for those bigrams. In this case Fisher's test provides a more reliable significance value.

Reference-contexts: In particular, for bigram data Fisher's ex act test is recommended. This test can be performed using PROC FREQ in the SAS System. Fisher's Exact Test Rather than using an asymptotic approximation of the significance of observing a particular table, Fisher's exact test <ref> (Fisher 1935) </ref> computes the significance of an observed table by exhaustively computing the probability of every table that would lead to the marginal totals that were observed in the sampled table. The significance values obtained using Fisher's exact test are reliable regardless of the distributional characteristics of the data sample.

Reference-contexts: The bad news is that there will always be a large number of words that occur just a few times. As an example, in a 133,000 word subset of the 0 20 40 60 80 100 % frequency u u ACL/DCI Wall Street Journal corpus <ref> (Marcus et al. 1993) </ref> there are 14,319 distinct words and 73,779 distinct bigrams. Of the distinct words, 48 percent of them occur only once and 80 percent of them occur five times or less.

Reference-contexts: The significance values obtained using Fisher's exact test are reliable regardless of the distributional characteristics of the data sample. However, when the number of comparable data samples is large, the exhaustive enumeration performed in Fisher's exact test becomes infeasible. In <ref> (Pedersen et al. 1996) </ref> an alternative test, the exact conditional test, is discussed for tables where Fisher's exact test is not a practical option.

Reference-contexts: More precisely, X 2 and G 2 are approximately 2 distributed when the following conditions regarding the random data sample hold <ref> (Read and Cressie 1988) </ref>: 1. the sample size is large, 2. the number of cells in the contingency table representation of the data is fixed and small relative to the sample size, and 3. the expected count (under the hypothetical popula tion model) for each cell is large. (Dunning 1993) shows <p> However, as pointed out in <ref> (Read and Cressie 1988) </ref>, it is uncertain whether G 2 holds to the 2 distribution when the minimum of the expected values in a table is less than 1.0.
