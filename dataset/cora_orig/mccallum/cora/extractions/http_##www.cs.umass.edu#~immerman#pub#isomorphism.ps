Abstract: We show that for most complexity classes of interest, all sets complete under first-order projections (fops) are isomorphic under first-order isomorphisms. That is, a very restricted version of the Berman-Hartmanis Conjecture holds. Since "natural" complete problems seem to stay complete via fops, this indicates that up to first-order isomorphism there is only one "natural" complete problem for each "nice" complexity class.

Reference-contexts: Namely for every nice complexity class including P, NP, etc, any two sets complete via fops are not only polynomial-time isomorphic, they are first-order isomorphic. There are additional reasons to be interested in first-order computation. It was shown in <ref> [BIS] </ref> that first-order computation corresponds exactly to computation by uniform AC 0 circuits under a natural notion of uniformity. <p> The circuits consist entirely of wires connecting input bits or negated input bits to outputs. If the circuit family fC n g is sufficiently uniform, we arrive at the class of first-order projections. (Recall that first-order corresponds to uniform AC 0 <ref> [BIS] </ref>.) We find it useful to work in the framework of first-order logic rather than in the circuit model. The rest of this section presents the necessary definitions of first-order reductions. <p> (0; r) ^ J 1 (i))) 4 The reader who is more familiar with bit hacking on Turing machines than with first-order formulas, could instead convince herself that this can be done by an alternating Turing machine running in logarithmic time and making O (1) alternations; first-order expressibility follows by <ref> [BIS] </ref>. 9 (Note that this first-order isomorphism b is not, strictly speaking, a first-order interpre-tation, since it maps some inputs to strictly shorter outputs, which is impossible for an interpretation.) 2 It now remains to show, Lemma 4.6 Suppose that a problem S is complete via fops for a nice complexity

Reference-contexts: However, if one-way functions exist (i.e., if P 6= UP) then there exists a one-way function f such that f (SAT) is polynomial-time isomorphic to SAT [Ga]. Here we can be more definitive: the bijection f (x) = 3x ( mod 2 jxj ) was shown in <ref> [BL] </ref> to be one-way for first-order computation, in the sense that f is first-order expressible, but f 1 is not. (See also [H-as] for other examples.) However, it is not too hard to show that for this choice of f , f (SAT ) is complete for NP under first-order projections,

These last reductions, defined in Section 3, are provably weaker than logspace reductions.

Reference-contexts: Thus the formula can only talk about bit positions, and not bit values. The choice of literals depends only on n. In order to make this definition, we must first define first-order interpretations. These are a standard notion from logic for translating one theory into another, cf. <ref> [End] </ref>, modified so that the transformation is also a many-one reduction, [I87].

Reference-contexts: To elaborate on this claim, note that the class NP arises naturally in the study of logic and can be defined entirely in terms of logic, without any mention of computation <ref> [Fa] </ref>. Thus it is natural to have a notion of NP-completeness that is formulated entirely in terms of logic. On another front, Valiant [Val] noticed that reducibility can be formulated in algebra using the natural notion of a projection, again with no mention of computation.

Reference-contexts: It is not known whether one-way functions exist since their existence would imply that P 6= NP. However, if one-way functions exist (i.e., if P 6= UP) then there exists a one-way function f such that f (SAT) is polynomial-time isomorphic to SAT <ref> [Ga] </ref>.
