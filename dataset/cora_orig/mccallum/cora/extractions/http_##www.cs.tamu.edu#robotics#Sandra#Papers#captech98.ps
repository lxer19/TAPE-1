Title: Motion Capture Data Manipulation and Reuse via B-splines  
Author: Sandra Sudarsky and Donald House 
Affiliation: 1 Computer Science Dept., Texas A&M University  Visualization Laboratory, Texas A&M University  
Abstract: This paper presents an integrated set of tools to facilitate the manipulation and reuse of motion capture data. A functional representation in terms of nonuniform B-splines provides a compact and efficient description of motion sequences. A collection of B-spline curves attached to a hierarchical structure is used to represent the animation of articulated figures. A set of primitive operators acting on these curves and their application to motion editing is presented. We have successfully used these primitives to generate smooth transitions between motion sequences, motion interpolation and motion cyclification.

Reference-contexts: In fact, often the whole acquisition process needs to be repeated in order to modify sections of a motion sequence [5]. Motion capture techniques can also be used to build a database of basic motions ([4], [13], <ref> [2] </ref>) to be used in interactive 3D character animation applications. In such environments, characters are controlled by the user and should move accordingly. <p> Rose et al. [11] applied spacetime and inverse kinematic constraints to generate smooth and dynamically plausible transitions between sequences of human body motions. Although physically correct, these transitions can not be generated in real time. Recently, Rose et al. <ref> [2] </ref> proposed a technique for real-time interpolation of motion sequences. Their approach closely relates to our own, it represents the motion of each degree of freedom as a function through time in terms of B-splines. <p> We can view each pair (t i ; T i ) as a time constraint specifying the time T i at which the value associated with time t i should occur. This problem is equivalent to the time warping problem described in [14] and <ref> [2] </ref>. However, instead of transforming the raw data to satisfy the time-constraints, we transform the knot vector o to a new knot sequence as follows.

Reference-contexts: These provide a compact representation of motion sequences and allow us to design a set of primitive operators that act on these curves to provide efficient tools to edit the motion. 3.1 Hierarchical Model The captured data is transformed into anatomical rotations corresponding to an articulated figure ([1], <ref> [3] </ref>). Our model has six degrees of freedom at the root (typically the hips) which allow us to translate and rotate the entire model. The rest of the hierarchy is modeled as a set of revolute joints, each with three rotational degrees of freedom.

Reference-contexts: The curve fitting problem described above assumes a fixed knot vector o . In the case that the position of knots are left as variables the problem becomes a constrained optimization problem. A number of algorithms to solve this problem have been proposed (see <ref> [7] </ref> for a good review). The success of these algorithms depends on the choice of the initial position of the knots and they suffer from the existence of many stationary points. For efficiency purposes, we select the knot vector prior to solving the least squares problem.

As in previous motion warping techniques, the user specifies a set of kinematic constraints that must be satisfied by the edited motion.

Reference-contexts: During the past decade, motion capture has become increasingly popular as a tool to speed up the computer animation process. It has been used to produce high quality animations in relatively short amounts of time <ref> [10] </ref>. The major drawback of this technique is the lack of tools to efficiently edit the captured data. In fact, often the whole acquisition process needs to be repeated in order to modify sections of a motion sequence [5].

Reference-contexts: Using this representation, they describe a method to interpolate periodic motions of articulated figures and to extract certain characteristics of human behavior. In contrast to this technique, our approach is not based on the frequency domain and therefore it is not restricted to periodic motions.

Although physically correct, these transitions can not be generated in real time. Recently, Rose et al. [2] proposed a technique for real-time interpolation of motion sequences.

Reference-contexts: In this case, we force the curve to reach the limiting value via motion warping. Kinematic constraints can be enforced via inverse kinematics. Once the joint angles are known, the motion curves for those joints can again be modified via motion warping techniques. 4 Results A prototype <ref> [12] </ref> is being implemented to serve as a testbed for the application of these operators to the manipulation and reuse of motion capture-based animation data. Figures 9 and 10 show original walking and running sequences.
