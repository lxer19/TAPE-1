Abstract: This document contains course notes and exercises for a course in technical writing. The course is intended for third-year computer engineering majors, and emphasizes technical documentation directed to engineers, engineering managers, technical writers, and other specialized audiences. Exercises include job applications and resumes, memos, electronic correspondence, algorithm description, in-program documentation, naive-user documentation, survey articles, proposal writing, document specification, progress reports, formal technical reports, and an oral presentation.

Reference-contexts: against the ones we have heard previously, so we are going to expect more of the later presentations. 15.6 Note on oral presentations at SIGGRAPH The following article is a column by Jim Blinn from IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications containing suggestions about presenting technical material to a large audience <ref> [Bli88] </ref>, reprinted with the permission of the publisher. Things I Hope Not to See or Hear at SIGGRAPH No, I'm not going to talk about flying logos or glass balls. I am going to talk about that special form of performance art known as Giving a Technical Presentation.

Reference-contexts: Now go back and look at your initial topic statement. This is probably now somewhat outdated, but it may provide a basis for your introduction, which you have not yet written. Introductions are fundamentally problem statements. Consult Huckin and Olsen on this issue, in the chapters mentioned above, especially <ref> [HO91, Chapter 5] </ref>. Write a good, clear, brief introduction to your survey article. Since you have already written the body of the article, and you know what you are going to say in it, the introduction should be fairly easy to do. <p> or hardware, or any other technical writing except in-program documentation. (Warning: each year someone tries to write a game specification, and each year the technical content and writing quality have been low|we will question closely any attempts at game specification.) Ways to generate ideas are included in Huckin and Olsen <ref> [HO91, Chapter 2] </ref>. Their Section 16.2 offers guidelines for writing a short informal proposal, as well as a sample informal proposal. Their Section 16.3 discusses editing your proposal. Read these sections before attempting this assignment. <p> Usually you can get re-hired somewhere else fairly soon, but having some money in the bank allows you to pick your job a bit more carefully. Huckin and Olsen also have some mention of ethical issues for engineers <ref> [HO91, Chapter 2] </ref>. The next section includes the 1979 text of the IEEE Code of Ethics for electrical engineers. The Code was revised recently, mainly in attempts to strengthen the wording about engineers' responsibility to society (see Section 13.4.3). <p> Because the progress report has significant time value (we want to know the current progress-not last week's), we do not ask that you bring in a draft for comments before turning in the final memo. Please use standard memo format <ref> [HO91, Chapter 13] </ref>. Don't forget to tell us the title of your project, preferably in the "Subject" field at the beginning of the memo|we can't remember exactly what everyone is doing! As always, retain the returned memo to turn back in at the end of the quarter. 14. <p> Here we will be discussing the sequential organization of the report itself, and the reasons for it. The relevant sections of Huckin and Olsen are Chapters 12 and 15 and Sections 9.3 and 9.4 <ref> [HO91] </ref>. Your final project can be a design description (for a design you did yourself), a library research paper, a formal proposal for a future design project, or user documentation. 14.2 Audience assessment|choose your own You must define your own audience for this project. <p> The tripartite structure discussed below is especially appropriate for documentation of your own research projects, what we have been calling design documents in class. If you have any questions as you are working, refer to this chapter or to Huckin and Olsen, Chapters 12 and 15 <ref> [HO91] </ref>, for the structure of formal reports. Some moderately useful stuff for library papers can be found in Chapter 16 of Huckin and Olsen, but you should also consult one of the other texts on reserve for this sort of paper. <p> You are unlikely to need all four items in Section 1, for instance, and you may or may not want to include a letter of transmittal to the contact person for your project. See pages 220-223 of Huckin and Olsen for an explanation of letters of transmittal <ref> [HO91, Section 11.3] </ref>. You might have to include a quite substantial appendix or supplementary section, depending on the project. Front Matter Letter of transmittal, title page, contents, list of figures, list of tables, and acknowl edgments. 1 Executive summary, abstract, preface, and introduction. <p> If humanly possible, don't do your report by memorizing a speech|it is not the best way. Huckin and Olsen have some advice and exercises for helping non-native speakers with pronunciation and intonation <ref> [HO91, Chapter 38] </ref>. Confidence in your understanding of your material, and taking your time will make up for a lot of awkward English and hyper-nervousness. So will substantial practice presenting your report. Get enough sleep the night before.
