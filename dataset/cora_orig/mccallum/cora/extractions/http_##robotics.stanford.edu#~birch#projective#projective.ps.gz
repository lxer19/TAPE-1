Reference-contexts: equation has two complex roots, known as the absolute points: i = (1; i; 0) and j = (1; i; 0). (Although we have, for simplicity, assumed that homogeneous coordinates are real, they can in general be the elements of any commutative field in which 1 + 1 6= 0 <ref> [1, p. 112] </ref>.) It will be shown in the next two subsections that the absolute points remain invariant under similarity transformations, which makes them useful for determining the angle between two lines. 2.7 Collineations A collineation of P 2 is defined as a mapping from the plane to itself such that <p> The transformation then is x 0 sin cos x t y : In closing this section, we offer one final proposition, along with its proof: Proposition 1 A transformation is a similarity transformation if and only if it preserves the absolute points, <ref> [1; i; 0] </ref>. The "only if " is rather easy to see: The absolute point [1; i; 0] T is transformed through equation (3) to the point e i [1; i; 0] T , which is equivalent because the scale factor is ignored. 10 The "if" is a little more complicated, <p> cos x t y : In closing this section, we offer one final proposition, along with its proof: Proposition 1 A transformation is a similarity transformation if and only if it preserves the absolute points, <ref> [1; i; 0] </ref>. The "only if " is rather easy to see: The absolute point [1; i; 0] T is transformed through equation (3) to the point e i [1; i; 0] T , which is equivalent because the scale factor is ignored. 10 The "if" is a little more complicated, but still rather straightforward. <p> along with its proof: Proposition 1 A transformation is a similarity transformation if and only if it preserves the absolute points, <ref> [1; i; 0] </ref>. The "only if " is rather easy to see: The absolute point [1; i; 0] T is transformed through equation (3) to the point e i [1; i; 0] T , which is equivalent because the scale factor is ignored. 10 The "if" is a little more complicated, but still rather straightforward. Starting with the unrestricted equation for T, T = 4 t 21 t 22 t 23 3 the fact that [1; i; 0] T is <p> the point e i <ref> [1; i; 0] </ref> T , which is equivalent because the scale factor is ignored. 10 The "if" is a little more complicated, but still rather straightforward. Starting with the unrestricted equation for T, T = 4 t 21 t 22 t 23 3 the fact that [1; i; 0] T is preserved yields the following two equations: t 11 + it 12 = i Since the elements of T are constrained to be real, this leads to the following three con straints on the elements of T : t 11 = t 22 t 31 = t <p> Multiplying the previous equation by 1=k (which is legal because we are working in homogeneous coordinates), we then get T = 4 sin cos t 23 =k 3 which is seen to be the equation of a similarity transformation when compared with equation (3). (note: Using the point <ref> [1; i; 0] </ref> T yields the same result.) 2.8 Laguerre formula Absolute points have a surprising but important application: they can be used to determine the angle between two lines. <p> To gain some intuition on why this formula is true, let us consider a simple example. Suppose we have two lines a 1 x y = 0 in the affine plane. It is clear that these two lines can be represented as two vectors v 1 = <ref> [1; a 1 ] </ref> T and v 2 = [1; a 2 ] T in the Euclidean plane. <p> Suppose we have two lines a 1 x y = 0 in the affine plane. It is clear that these two lines can be represented as two vectors v 1 = [1; a 1 ] T and v 2 = <ref> [1; a 2 ] </ref> T in the Euclidean plane. <p> The directed angle between the two lines is the directed angle between the two vectors and is given by: tan = v 1 v 2 a 1 a 2 : Now in the projective plane these lines are represented as <ref> [a 1 ; 1; 0] </ref> T and [a 2 ; 1; 0] T , which are found by mapping points [x; y] T in the affine plane to points [x; y; 1] T in the projective plane. <p> The directed angle between the two lines is the directed angle between the two vectors and is given by: tan = v 1 v 2 a 1 a 2 : Now in the projective plane these lines are represented as [a 1 ; 1; 0] T and <ref> [a 2 ; 1; 0] </ref> T , which are found by mapping points [x; y] T in the affine plane to points [x; y; 1] T in the projective plane. <p> tan = v 1 v 2 a 1 a 2 : Now in the projective plane these lines are represented as [a 1 ; 1; 0] T and [a 2 ; 1; 0] T , which are found by mapping points [x; y] T in the affine plane to points <ref> [x; y; 1] </ref> T in the projective plane. The ideal line passing through i = [1; i; 0] T and j = [1; i; 0] T is given by i fi j = [0; 0; 1] T . <p> The ideal line passing through i = <ref> [1; i; 0] </ref> T and j = [1; i; 0] T is given by i fi j = [0; 0; 1] T . <p> The ideal line passing through i = <ref> [1; i; 0] </ref> T and j = [1; i; 0] T is given by i fi j = [0; 0; 1] T . The two points of intersection between this line and the two original lines are given by [1; a 1 ; 0] T and [1; a 2 ; 0] T . <p> The ideal line passing through i = [1; i; 0] T and j = [1; i; 0] T is given by i fi j = <ref> [0; 0; 1] </ref> T . The two points of intersection between this line and the two original lines are given by [1; a 1 ; 0] T and [1; a 2 ; 0] T . <p> The ideal line passing through i = [1; i; 0] T and j = [1; i; 0] T is given by i fi j = [0; 0; 1] T . The two points of intersection between this line and the two original lines are given by <ref> [1; a 1 ; 0] </ref> T and [1; a 2 ; 0] T . <p> The two points of intersection between this line and the two original lines are given by [1; a 1 ; 0] T and <ref> [1; a 2 ; 0] </ref> T .
