Abstract: Radiosurgery is a non-invasive procedure that uses focused beams of radiation to destroy brain tumors. Treatment planning for ra-diosurgery involves determining a series of beam configurations that will destroy the tumor without damaging healthy tissue in the brain, particularly critical structures. A new image-guided robotic radiosurgical system has been developed at Stanford University in a joint project with Accu-ray, Inc. It has been in clinical use at Stanford since July, 1994, and thus far three patients have been treated with it. This system provides much more flexibility for treatment planning than do traditional radiosurgical systems. In order to take full advantage of this added flexibility, we have developed automatic methods for treatment planning. Our planner enables a surgeon to specify constraints interactively on the distribution of dose delivered and then to find a set of beam configurations that will satisfy these constraints. We provide a detailed description of our treatment planning algorithms and summarize our first experiences using the system in a clinical setting.

Reference-contexts: Recently, a new system capable of image-guided robotic radiosurgery was developed at Stanford University Medical Center in a joint project with Ac-curay, Inc. This system was developed to overcome many of the limitations of conventional radiosurgery <ref> [1, 7] </ref>. It uses a six-degree-of-freedom GMF robotic manipulator arm to position the radiation source and a real-time imaging system to monitor the patient's motion continuously. The system has been described previously [1]. <p> This system was developed to overcome many of the limitations of conventional radiosurgery [1, 7]. It uses a six-degree-of-freedom GMF robotic manipulator arm to position the radiation source and a real-time imaging system to monitor the patient's motion continuously. The system has been described previously <ref> [1] </ref>. In [7] we propose a new method for treatment planning that takes advantage of the flexibility offered by this new system and enables us to create irregularly shaped dose distributions that closely match the tumor shape. We have continued to refine the treatment planning methods described in [7]. <p> The beam selector generates several hundred beams. However, not all of these beams will ultimately be used; during the plan-refinement step, non-useful beams are removed from the path. Target Point Selection We have experimented with several different methods for selecting target points <ref> [1] </ref>. The method that has produced the best results involves selecting target points that are evenly spaced on the surface of the tumor. To approximate the tumor surface, we use the three-dimensional reconstruction generated from the surgeon's description of the tumor. <p> That node becomes the source point for the given target point. We have experimented with more deterministic methods for orienting the beams at the target points <ref> [1] </ref> but have found that using random orientations leads to a more homogeneous dose distribution within the tumor.

The goal of radiosurgery is to deliver a necrotic dose of radiation to the tumor while minimizing the amount of radiation to healthy brain tissues, particularly critical or dose-sensitive tissues (such as the brain stem or optic nerves).
