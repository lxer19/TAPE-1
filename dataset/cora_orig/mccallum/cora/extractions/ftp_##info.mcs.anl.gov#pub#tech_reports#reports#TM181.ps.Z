Reference-contexts: The terminology "boundary layer" has its origin in fluid dynamics. In the motion of a viscous fluid near a boundary, the viscosity causes rapid variations of the fluid velocity in a thin layer near the boundary, a phenomenon first studied by Prandtl in 1904 <ref> [1] </ref>. Later developments in continuum mechanics revealed that the phenomenon of boundary layer behavior was not confined to fluid dynamics, but that it is indeed a widespread phenomenon caused by "singular perturbations" in the mathematical model.

Reference-contexts: example of a transition layer, consider the boundary value problem *u xx + 2uu x = 0; x 2 (1; 1); lim u (x) = 1: This nonlinear problem is a prototype of many other problems in the theory of nonlinear waves; it is a special case of Burgers equation <ref> [2] </ref> or [3, Chapter 4]. Its solution is known, u (*; x) = tanh (x=*) for 1 &lt; x &lt; 1.

Its solution is known, u (*; x) = tanh (x=*) for 1 &lt; x &lt; 1. To put this problem in the functional framework, define D 1 = (1; 0) and D 2 = (0; 1) and put D = D 1 [ D 2 .
