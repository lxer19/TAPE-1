Abstract: In the analysis of signals from complex environments, often it is not possible to rely on a single set of signal processing algorithms (SPAs) to produce a set of data correlates that permit meaningful interpretation. In such situations, what is needed is the structured fusion of data from multiple applications of SPAs (reprocessings) with different parameter values. We present the Integrated Processing and Understanding of Signals (IPUS) architecture as a framework for structuring interaction between the search for SPAs appropriate to the environment and the search for interpretation models to explain the SPAs' output data correlates. In this paper we describe our use of IPUS to control the integration of output from multiple SPA applications in a system for acoustic signal interpretation of household sounds.

Reference-contexts: While performing these searches, the architecture engages in data reprocessing. We use this term to refer both to re-application of generic SPAs with different control parameters and to selective application of SPA instances to augment initial processings' deficiencies with respect to the environment <ref> [1] </ref>. The results of these reprocessings must be carefully maintained and fused, since they play an important role in constraining the framework's two search processes.

Reference-contexts: Use of the traditional paradigm in complex environments often leads to front-end SPA sets that grow combi-natorially with the possible object combinations and environmental states <ref> [5] </ref>. Complex environments do not lend themselves to comprehensive analysis for determining the appropriate front-end SPA instances. <p> Specifically, we first discuss the fusion of observations of the same data made with different instances of the same generic SPAs, then we discuss the fusion of observations of the same data made with instances of different generic SPAs. The Model Variety Problem <ref> [5, 9] </ref> focuses on the relationship between SPAs and the classes of signals for which they can produce undistorted correlates.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Traditionally, perceptual systems have been designed according to the architecture of Figure 1, with a fixed set of front-end signal processing algorithm (SPA) instances <ref> [6, 11] </ref>. By "SPA instance" we mean a generic algorithm (e.g. an N-point FFT) instantiated with specific control parameter values. These instances are chosen after careful analysis of the environment determines which combinations of SPA instances can compute "adequate" correlates for the interpretation component of the system.

In this case we say that the generic SPA has an inherent model-variety problem with respect to the environment <ref> [9] </ref>. For example, in the acoustic domain no SPA can simultaneously provide infinite frequency and infinite temporal resolution.

Reference-contexts: Regardless of what fusion methods are used by the interpretation component, the implicit assumption is that the SPA instances supplying the correlates are appropriate to the environment being monitored. Consider the generic Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) algorithm <ref> [10] </ref> in the acoustic domain. An STFT SPA instance has particular values for its parameters, such as analysis window length, frequency-sampling rate, and decimation interval. Depending on a scenario's spectral features and their time-variant nature, these parameter values increase or decrease the instance's appropriateness for monitoring the scenario.
