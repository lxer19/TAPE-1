Abstract: A multimedia ATM network is shared by media channels with different performance requirements and traffic characteristics. In order to make efficient use of network resources, the quality of service provided to the users should be as close as possible to their requirements. In this paper, different priority assignment schemes are considered, and a scheme with two levels of cell loss priority within each channel is proposed. A fraction of the cells of each connection is assigned to high priority and the rest to low priority. The priorities are assigned and enforced by the network. The assignment and enforcement of priorities is local at each switch along the path of a connection; the fractions assigned to high and low priorities can be different for the same connection at two different switches. The assignment is also dynamic; it is updated every time a connection is set up or one is terminated. Algorithms used by the network to decide the fraction of cells of each stream assigned to each cell loss priority level, along with a very simple mechanism to enforce the desired priority assignment, are presented. Finally, a real-time admission control algorithm for the proposed scheme is provided, with running time of very few milliseconds even for thousands of heterogeneous sources.

Reference-contexts: The first assigns multiple priorities within the same channel by assigning a fraction of the cells of each channel to each of the priority levels (eg. <ref> [1] </ref>). An important design issue in this case is the way in which the fractions to be mapped to each priority level are decided. The second method of priority assignment assigns the whole channel to a single priority level (eg. [7]).

Reference-contexts: An obvious disadvantage is that all the channels within the same priority level are treated uniformly, independent of their loss requirements. Schemes with more than two priority levels are feasible in terms of hardware support, as can be seen from <ref> [2] </ref> where an ATM switch that can support hundreds of priority levels is proposed. In the extreme case, one channel can be assigned to each priority level, but then the number of priority levels defines the maximum number of channels that can be supported.

Reference-contexts: Continuous media have stringent delay jitter requirements. Finally, some applications require loss-free transmission. In <ref> [3] </ref> the first complete traffic management scheme for multimedia ATM networks is introduced. It supports four different classes of traffic, each of which has different performance requirements expressed in terms of delay jitter guarantees and cell or burst level loss guarantees (Table 1). <p> A complete specification of the way the switches operate as well as real-time connection admission control (CAC) algorithms are presented in <ref> [3] </ref>. The approach studied in [3] provides support for a very wide variety of sources, but apart from the inherent efficiency achieved through the use of statistical multiplexing, no explicit mechanisms to increase the efficient use of network resources are considered. 2 Table 1: Classification of Provided Services Loss-free Burst-scale Cell-scale <p> A complete specification of the way the switches operate as well as real-time connection admission control (CAC) algorithms are presented in <ref> [3] </ref>.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of related work.

Two solutions for the assignment of priorities by the network are proposed, and a simple implementation of the priority assignment mechanism is also provided in the same section. In Section 5 the CAC algorithm for this scheme is presented.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the admission control in the proposed schemes is based on pre-computed look-up tables under the assumption of homogeneous channels. Another approach to providing different kinds of service to channels with different requirements is through the use of priorities. In <ref> [4] </ref>, the usefulness of priorities is demonstrated through simulation studies for a scheme supporting two different QoS classes corresponding to different loss requirements. In [7] each channel is assigned either a high or a low priority. Traffic estimators are used to estimate the high priority traffic characteristics.

Reference-contexts: Framing Strategy In order to preserve the traffic characteristics of the channels throughout the network and provide a constant delay and a strictly bounded jitter to all cells, an extension of the framing strategy proposed in <ref> [5] </ref>, will be used. The framing strategy proposed in [5] divides time into equal intervals called frames and denoted by T . Each source can transmit at most up to an agreed amount of information within each frame. <p> Framing Strategy In order to preserve the traffic characteristics of the channels throughout the network and provide a constant delay and a strictly bounded jitter to all cells, an extension of the framing strategy proposed in <ref> [5] </ref>, will be used.

There are two potential drawbacks in the framing strategy proposed in <ref> [5] </ref> associated with the efficient use of network resources. a CAC algorithm. First it performs a peak rate allocation, leading to poor utilization of the available resources. Second, the framing introduces a discretization of the possible rates of operation of a source.

Reference-contexts: When a new channel requests connection, then the channel is mapped to the class which is closer to the service requirements of the channel. In <ref> [6] </ref> such a scheme with three different traffic classes is proposed. The admission in this scheme can be performed based on pre-computed look-up tables showing the admission regions, under the assumption of homogeneous channels within each class.

An obvious disadvantage is that all the channels within the same priority level are treated uniformly, independent of their loss requirements.

Reference-contexts: The admission in this scheme can be performed based on pre-computed look-up tables showing the admission regions, under the assumption of homogeneous channels within each class. A similar approach, where the different classes are specified by the cell loss probability and the maximum cell delay, can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. In this paper, it is suggested that a dynamic assignment of the percentage of time devoted to servicing each class in response to changes in the traffic load would lead to increased utilization of the system. All approaches based on predefined classes share some common drawbacks.
