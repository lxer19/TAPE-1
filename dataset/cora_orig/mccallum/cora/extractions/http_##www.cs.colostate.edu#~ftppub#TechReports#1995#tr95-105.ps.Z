Riseman. </author> <title> Segmenting images using localized histograms and region merging. </title> <journal> International Journal of Computer Vision, </journal> <volume> 2(3), </volume> <year> 1989. </year>
Reference-contexts: In HSV or similar color space, the shadow areas should appear as islands of different brightness (Value) within larger areas of similar Hue and Saturation. We will locate these islands using the shadow probability map in conjunction with a form of region segmentation, similar to that discussed in <ref> [BGK + 89] </ref>. Once the shadow regions are located and labelled, we will proceed to solve for the reflectance value. Most terrain in the photographs used will roughly approximate Lambertian reflection.

Reference-contexts: As we integrate the shadow probability map into the shadow removal process, we will determine if the current accuracy is sufficient to guide the shadow removal process. Accuracy of the map can be increased by using multiple rays for each location. A stochastic sampling process <ref> [Coo86] </ref>, jittering the ray direction and starting position, will account for the factors mentioned above. 4.1.2 Speed The ray casting method described can be time-consuming for a large elevation map.

Reference-contexts: Available elevation data typically has a sample spacing of about 30 meters, while low altitude aerial photographs can commonly resolve detail to less than 1 meter. Prior research in the area of shadow detection in aerial photographs has not considered the imprecision of the terrain elevations. Franklin <ref> [Fra91] </ref> locates shadows based on height fields using LANDSAT and SPOT satellite images, which have much lower resolution than low-altitude aerial photographs. Thirion [Thi92] uses a detailed 3D scene model to find shadows in scenes, employing a simple histogram technique to remove errors.

Reference-contexts: A common form is the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) <ref> [Geo90] </ref>. In addition to the elevation samples, the DEM includes an RMS error value for the data set. In the mountainous areas with which we are primarily concerned, the RMS error value is typically on the order of 10 meters.

Reference-contexts: Ambient light from the sky will be added depending on the time of year and time of day. Surface orientation will be calculated using methods described in <ref> [GP93, Gos93] </ref>. The result of this process will be reflectance values corresponding to every pixel in the aerial photograph, suitable for use as a texture map with new illumination parameters. 5 Conclusions Terrain rendering methods previously developed treat the underlying height field as error free.

Reference-contexts: Based on input values specifying the date, time, and geographic location at which an aerial photograph was taken, we calculate the direction to the sun <ref> [PP76] </ref>. At present we model the sun as a directional light source; in the future we will extend our algorithm to allow for an area light source.

Reference-contexts: This projection yields a sun's-eye view of the terrain, in which case surface shadow determination is equivalent to the well known computer graphics problem of hidden surface determination. Following transformation of the data into viewing coordinates, a modified version of the floating horizon visibility test <ref> [Rog85] </ref> would be applied to each cell in turn. A shadow probability is assigned to each cell based upon its projected distance above or below the current horizon.

Reference-contexts: The technique described is designed for scenes containing buildings and other regularly shaped and easily modeled artifacts, and is not directly applicable to use with imprecise terrain models. Other work such as [Zho92] ignores shadows by assuming a high sun angle. Techniques developed by Shu <ref> [Shu90] </ref> remove shadows of clouds in aerial photographs. Although we are not addressing cloud shadow removal, the detection of fuzzy and irregular edges should prove applicable to removal of terrain shadows with uncertain edge locations.
