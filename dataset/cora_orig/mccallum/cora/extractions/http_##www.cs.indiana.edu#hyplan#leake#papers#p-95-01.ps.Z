Title: Representing Self-knowledge for Introspection about Memory Search  
Author: David B. Leake 
Address: Bloomington, Indiana 47405  
Affiliation: Computer Science Department Indiana University  
Date: March 1995.

Abstract: This position paper sketches a framework for modeling introspective reasoning and discusses the relevance of that framework for modeling introspective reasoning about memory search. It argues that effective and flexible memory processing in rich memories should be built on five types of explicitly represented self-knowledge: knowledge about information needs, relationships between different types of information, expectations for the actual behavior of the information search process, desires for its ideal behavior, and representations of how those expectations and desires relate to its actual performance. This approach to modeling memory search is both an illustration of general principles for modeling introspective reasoning and a step towards addressing the problem of how a reasoner human or machinecan acquire knowledge about the properties of its own knowledge base.
