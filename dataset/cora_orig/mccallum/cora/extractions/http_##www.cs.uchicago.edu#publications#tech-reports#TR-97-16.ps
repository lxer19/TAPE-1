Abstract: We investigate the frequency of complete sets for various complexity classes within EXP under several polynomial-time reductions in the sense of resource bounded measure. We show that these sets are scarce: tt -complete sets for EXP have p-measure zero. A key ingredient is the Small Span Theorem, which states that for any set A in EXP at least one of its lower span (i.e., the sets that reduce to A) or its upper span (i.e., the sets that A reduces to) has p 2 -measure zero. Previous to our work, the theorem was only known to hold for btt -reductions. We establish it for 6 p

Reference-contexts: The strongest Small Span Theorem previous to our work was due to Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn <ref> [ASNT96] </ref>, who proved it for 6 p btt -reductions. The extension to reductions with a non-constant number of queries was a notorious open problem in the area. <p> Previously, it was only known for 6 p btt -reductions that the p 2 -measure of the complete sets for EXP have p 2 -measure zero <ref> [ASNT96, BM95] </ref>. We also obtain that the p 2 -measure of the 6 p n ff tt -hard sets for E and EXP is zero. <p> Since we have log q 2 O (log n i ), we get a contradiction to the Kolmogorov randomness of . Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn <ref> [ASNT96] </ref> focused on p-measure, and they established the equivalent of Theorem 3.1 and the Small Span Theorem within E for 6 p ktt -reductions for any constant k. A similar Kolmogorov argument as above indicates that our techniques are not powerful enough to extend these results to stronger reductions.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we next look at what we can show under a non-relativizing reasonable but yet unproven complexity theoretic hypothesis, namely the assumption that MA 6= EXP. Babai, Fortnow, Nisan and Wigderson <ref> [BFNW93] </ref> established the existence of a pseudo-random generator that can be used to simulate BPP in subexponential time for intnitely many input lengths unless MA = EXP. <p> The proof follows directly from the next results of Babai, Fortnow, Nisan and Wigderson <ref> [BFNW93] </ref>, and Nisan and Wigderson [NW94], combined with some padding. 4 Theorem 2.4 ([BFNW93]) If MA 6= EXP, there is a set A 2 EXP such that for any integer k, H A (n) &gt; n k for intnitely many n.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we follow that line of research. We investigate complete and hard sets for NP, the levels of the polynomial-time hierarchy, PSPACE and EXP, and give some evidence that they have p 2 -measure zero. On the other hand, the results of Bennett and Gill <ref> [BG81] </ref> imply that the 6 tt -hard sets for BPP do not have p 2 -measure zero; Allender and Strauss [AS94] even showed they have p 2 -measure 1 in EXP. We use three dierent approaches to obtain our results. <p> This follows from the relativizable result of Bennett and Gill <ref> [BG81] </ref> that (P 1 tt (A)) = 1 for any A 2 BPP.

Reference-contexts: We establish the Small Span Theorem for 6 p n o (1) tt -reductions, i.e., for non-adaptive reductions that make a subpolynomial number of queries.

Lutz [Lut95] obtained a Small Span Theorem for non-uniform reductions w.r.t. pspace-measure. Similar to his proof, our Small Span Theorem follows from the fact that most sets in EXP have a 6 n o (1) tt -upper span with p 2 -measure zero.

Reference-contexts: Babai, Fortnow, Nisan and Wigderson [BFNW93] established the existence of a pseudo-random generator that can be used to simulate BPP in subexponential time for intnitely many input lengths unless MA = EXP. Using this pseudo-random generator, Buhrman et al. <ref> [BvMR + 98] </ref> showed that the class of 6 p complete sets for each of the -levels of the polynomial-time hierarchy has p-measure zero unless EXP = MA. <p> In particular, the class of 6 tt -complete sets for EXP (or E) has p-measure zero unless EXP = MA. 11 Buhrman et al. <ref> [BvMR + 98] </ref> used the hypothesis MA 6= EXP to show that the class of autore--ducible sets under the same type of reductions has p-measure zero.

Reference-contexts: c, the class of 6 p cnT -complete sets for E has p-measure zero. 5 Complete Sets for EXP under Adaptive Reductions Theorem 4.1 cannot be improved using relativizable techniques, since it fails for unbounded growing exponent c in a world where BPP = EXP, and such a world exists <ref> [Hel86] </ref>.
