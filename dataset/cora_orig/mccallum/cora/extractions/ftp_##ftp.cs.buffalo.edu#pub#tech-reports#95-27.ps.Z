Title: The bounded membership problem of the monoid SL  
Author:  (N Jin-Yi Cai Zicheng Liu 
Abstract: SL 2 (N ) is the set of all 2 fi 2 matrices with nonnegative integer entries and determinant 1. The bounded membership problem BMN of SL 2 (N ) is that given a subset S of SL 2 (N ), a matrix A 2 SL 2 (N ), and an integer n, whether A can be represented as a product of at most n matrices (repetitions are allowed) in S. We prove that BMN is NP-complete, but its randomized version under natural distribution is solvable in average polynomial time. Furthermore, it is proved that if the number of elements of S is a constant, then BMN is polynomial time computable.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we will also discuss search problems associated with these decision problems. Blass and Gurevich <ref> [1] </ref> proved that BMZ is NP-complete. The motivation for the current paper was to resolve the question raised by Blass and Gurevich whether the randomized version of BMZ under natural distribution is complete for the average case or solvable in average polynomial time. <p> Recently, while the current paper was under review by referees, the original problem raised by Blass and Gurevich with respect to BMZ was resolved by Cai et. al. [2]. They showed that indeed as conjectured <ref> [1] </ref> BMZ under natural distribution is solvable in average polynomial time. 2 Notations Throughout this paper, unless otherwise specified, the size jsj of a binary string s is its length. The size jxj of an integer x is the length of its binary representation. <p> A probability distribution P X on X. Definition 2.2 Let f be a function from a domain X to nonnegative reals. f is polynomial on average, abbreviated AP, if there is an * &gt; 0, such that P f * (x) Lemma 2.3 <ref> [1] </ref> The collection of AP functions on a domain is closed under addition and multiplication. 3 Definition 2.4 A randomized decision problem is a pair (D; ) where D is a decision problem and is a probability distribution on the instances of D. <p> For the definitions of randomized reductions and completeness for the average case, the reader is referred to [6]. In the following, we define the standard uniform probability distribution of the instances of BMN. For a discussion of various definitions of natural distributions, the reader is referred to <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> We will use to denote the natural distribution on the instances (X; S; n) of BMN: -(X; S; n) = PI (n) fl PM (X) fl PI (#S) fl A2S PM (A). 3 BMN is NP-complete First we prove that BMN is NP-complete by adapting a proof in <ref> [1] </ref> for BMZ. Definition 3.1 Simple Integer Sum is the following decision problem : Instance: A positive integer K, a finite set S of positive integers, and an integer n. <p> For each i, 1 i 3q, let a i be the integer represented by a string in B with exactly one 1 which appears at the rightmost position of the i-th block counted from right to left. Claim 3.3 <ref> [1] </ref> If P 3q P 3q i=1 fi i a i and 0 ff i ; fi i q for each i, then ff i = fi i for each i. <p> BS is a free monoid generated by the letters 0 and 1. Lemma 4.1 <ref> [1] </ref> The monoid SL 2 (N ) is isomorphic to the monoid BS. 5 Let A 0 = 1 0 ! 0 1 . There are exactly two isomorphisms of SL 2 (N ) onto BS. <p> What we need next is to bound the size jI (X)j in terms of jXj on the average. The fact that jI (X)j is polynomial on the average was proved in <ref> [1] </ref>; our proof here leads to a precise bound, and some results in the process of the proof will be used in the next section to give a polynomial time algorithm for BMN (). 4.2 jI (X)j on the average We first collect some preliminary results on unimodular matrices. <p> We show next that it follows from Lemma 4.6 that every c d 2 SL 2 (N ) is expressible uniquely as a product of A 0 = 1 1 , and B 0 = 1 1 ! . This was shown in <ref> [1] </ref>; however in order to prove our precise bound in Theorem 4.10 we will give the following proof. Suppose c d 6= I, and a ! d . Then c d = a b b ! 1 1 .

Reference-contexts: Finally, we prove that this algorithm runs in polynomial time. It is well known that finding the shortest path between two vertices in a directed weighted graph (with nonneg-ative weights) can be done in polynomial time (for example, see <ref> [3] </ref>). So it suffices to show that the construction of the graph can be done in polynomial time. The only step that is not immediately seen to be computable in polynomial time is the construction of V . We note that l = jI (X)j could be exponentially large.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In 1990, Gurevich <ref> [5] </ref> proved the first algebraic average case complete problem, the matrix decomposition problem. He also raised the question whether a simpler version of the problem, which is in some sense a more natural problem, is complete in the average case as well, or is solvable in average polynomial time. <p> This is the motivation for our current paper. 1 Here, we consider the simple version of another similar average case complete problem, the matrix correspondence problem <ref> [5] </ref>. The two sets of problems are closely related|the simple version of the matrix decomposition problem becomes the bounded membership problem of SL 2 (Z), the simple version of the matrix correspondence problem becomes the bounded membership problem of SL 2 (N ). <p> If x and y are both integers or matrices, xy denotes the product of them. The following definitions on average case complexity theory are first given by Levin [8]. Our presentation follows that given by Gurevich [6] <ref> [5] </ref>. Definition 2.1 A domain X consists of: 1. An underlying set, called the universe of X, often denoted by X as well, comprising strings in some alphabet X ; 2.
