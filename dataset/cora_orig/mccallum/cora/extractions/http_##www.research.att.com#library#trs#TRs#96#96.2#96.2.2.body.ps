Abstract: Quorum systems are well-known tools for ensuring the consistency and availability of replicated data despite the benign failure of data repositories. In this paper we consider the arbitrary (Byzantine) failure of data repositories and present the first study of quorum system requirements and constructions that ensure data availability and consistency despite these failures. We also consider the load associated with our quorum systems, i.e., the minimal access probability of the busiest server. For services subject to arbitrary failures, we demonstrate quorum systems over n servers with a load of O( 1 p n ), thus meeting the lower bound on load for benignly fault-tolerant quorum systems. We explore several variations of our quorum systems and extend our constructions to cope with arbitrary client failures.

Our quorum constructions can also be directly exploited in algorithms that employ "uniform" quorums for fault tolerance either explicitly or implicitly (by involving a threshold of processes), in order to tolerate non-uniform failure scenarios.

Reference-contexts: A natural example is a database of public key certificates as found in many public key distribution systems (e.g., <ref> [CCIT88, TA91, LABW92, Ken93] </ref>). A public key certificate is a structure containing a name for a user and a public key, and represents the assertion that the indicated public key can be used to authenticate messages from the indicated user. <p> It is important to note that timestamps must be included as part of the self-verifying information, so they cannot be undetectably altered by faulty servers.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, however, we choose to demonstrate a variable supporting read and write operations with relatively weak semantics, in order to maintain focus on our quorum constructions. These semantics imply a safe variable <ref> [Lam86] </ref> in the case of a single reader and single writer, which a set of correct clients can use to build other abstractions, e.g., atomic, multi-writer multi-reader registers [Lam86, IS92, LTV96], concurrent timestamp systems [DS89, IL93], l-exclusion [DGS88, ADGM90], and atomic snapshot scan [ADGM93, And93]. <p> These semantics imply a safe variable [Lam86] in the case of a single reader and single writer, which a set of correct clients can use to build other abstractions, e.g., atomic, multi-writer multi-reader registers <ref> [Lam86, IS92, LTV96] </ref>, concurrent timestamp systems [DS89, IL93], l-exclusion [DGS88, ADGM90], and atomic snapshot scan [ADGM93, And93]. <p> For the purposes of this paper, we define correctness of this variable as follows; a more formal treatment of these concepts can be found in <ref> [Lam86] </ref>. We say that a read or write operation op 1 precedes an operation op 2 if op 1 terminates (in real time, at the client that initiated it) before op 2 starts (in real time, at the client initiating it). <p> Then, our correctness condition requires that any read that is concurrent with no writes returns the last value written in some serialization of the preceding writes. In the case of a single-reader, single-writer variable, this will immediately imply safe semantics <ref> [Lam86] </ref>. Copies of the variable x are stored at each server, along with a timestamp value t. Timestamps are assigned by a client to each replica of the variable when the client writes the replica. <p> This is immediate, however, as if it did precede another write operation in W , that write operation would have a higher timestamp. 2 The above lemma implies that the protocol above implements a single-writer single-reader safe variable <ref> [Lam86] </ref>. From these, multi-writer multi-reader atomic variables can be built using well-known constructions [Lam86, IS92, LTV96]. <p> From these, multi-writer multi-reader atomic variables can be built using well-known constructions <ref> [Lam86, IS92, LTV96] </ref>. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a masking quorum system (and a construction for one, if it exists) for any given fail-prone system B is given in the following theorem: Theorem 4.1 Let B be a fail-prone system for a universe U . <p> in a concurrent write operation, then it must return the value written by the last preceding write operation in some serialization of all preceding write operations, by an argument similar to that for Lemma 4.1. 2 The above lemmata imply that the protocol above implements a single-writer single-reader regular variable <ref> [Lam86] </ref>. Theorems analogous to the ones given for masking quorum systems above are easily derived for dissemination quorums. Below, we list these results without proof.

Reference-contexts: The grid construction above is dominated: e.g., all of the column elements above the top row in each quorum can be removed (and the quorum system remains dominated).

Reference-contexts: Other techniques have been proposed for constructing distributed services that tolerate the arbitrary failure of some component servers, e.g., see <ref> [Sch90, Mar90, RB94] </ref>. Such techniques of which we are aware typically require that all servers receive and process all client accesses, and thus they exhibit high load.

Reference-contexts: Our motivation for exploring this generalization stems from our experience in constructing secure distributed services <ref> [Rei96, MR96] </ref>, i.e., distributed services that can tolerate the malicious corruption of some (typically, up to a threshold number of ) component servers by an attacker. A criticism to assuming a simple threshold of corrupted servers is that server penetrations may not be independent. <p> Our quorum constructions can also be directly exploited in algorithms that employ "uniform" quorums for fault tolerance either explicitly or implicitly (by involving a threshold of processes), in order to tolerate non-uniform failure scenarios. Examples include algorithms for shared memory emulation [ABD95], randomized Byzantine agreement [Tou84], reliable Byzantine multicast <ref> [BT85, Rei94, MR96] </ref>, and secure replicated data [HT88]. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. We begin in Section 2 with a description of related work. In Section 3 we present our system model and definitions.

Reference-contexts: We conclude in Section 7. 2 Related work Our work was influenced by the substantial body of literature on quorum systems for benign failures and applications that make use of them, e.g., <ref> [Gif79, Tho79, Mae85, GB85, Her86, ET89, CAA90, AE91, NW94, PW95] </ref>.

Quorum systems have been previously employed in the implementation of security mechanisms. Naor and Wool [NW96] described methods to construct an access-control service using quorums. Their constructions use cryptographic techniques to ensure that out-of-date (but correct) servers cannot grant access to unauthorized users. <p> In some cases, the client can achieve progress by incrementally accessing servers until it obtains responses from a quorum of them. 3.3 Load A measure of the inherent performance of a quorum system is its load. Naor and Wool <ref> [NW94] </ref> define the load of a quorum system as the probability of accessing the busiest server in the best case. <p> A strength of this definition is that load is a property of a quorum system, and not of the protocol using it. A comparison of the definition of load to other seemingly plausible definitions is given in <ref> [NW94] </ref>. They also explore a related notion, the capacity of a quorum system, which is the rate at which the system handles quorum accesses. <p> By construction, Q is a masking quorum iff M1 holds for Q, i.e., iff for all B 1 ; B 2 ; B 3 ; B 4 2 B: 2 The following theorem was proved in <ref> [NW94] </ref> for benign-failure quorum systems, and holds for masking quorums as well (as a result of M1). Let c (Q) denote the size of the smallest quorum of Q. <p> Let c (Q) denote the size of the smallest quorum of Q. Theorem 4.2 If Q is a quorum system over a universe of n elements, then L (Q) maxf 1 c (Q) c (Q) The proof of this theorem in <ref> [NW94] </ref> employs rather complex methods. Here we present a simpler proof of their theorem. 6 Proof. Let w be any strategy for the quorum system Q, and fix Q 1 2 Q such that jQ 1 j = c (Q).

The grid construction would work for some non-square grids as well, e.g., triangular grids [Lov73], or CWlog grids <ref> [PW95] </ref> (that contain 2 i rows of length 2 i each).

Reference-contexts: Agrawal and El Abbadi [AE90] and Mukkamala [Muk94] considered the confidentiality of replicated data despite the disclosure of the contents of a threshold of the (otherwise correct) repositories. Their constructions used quorums with increased intersection, combined with Rabin's dispersal scheme <ref> [Rab89] </ref>, to enhance the confidentiality and availability of the data despite some servers crashing or their contents being observed. Our work differs from all of the above by considering arbitrarily faulty servers, and accommodating failure scenarios beyond a simple threshold of servers.

Reference-contexts: Our quorum constructions can also be directly exploited in algorithms that employ "uniform" quorums for fault tolerance either explicitly or implicitly (by involving a threshold of processes), in order to tolerate non-uniform failure scenarios. Examples include algorithms for shared memory emulation [ABD95], randomized Byzantine agreement [Tou84], reliable Byzantine multicast <ref> [BT85, Rei94, MR96] </ref>, and secure replicated data [HT88]. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. We begin in Section 2 with a description of related work. In Section 3 we present our system model and definitions.

Reference-contexts: Our motivation for exploring this generalization stems from our experience in constructing secure distributed services <ref> [Rei96, MR96] </ref>, i.e., distributed services that can tolerate the malicious corruption of some (typically, up to a threshold number of ) component servers by an attacker. A criticism to assuming a simple threshold of corrupted servers is that server penetrations may not be independent.

Reference-contexts: Other techniques have been proposed for constructing distributed services that tolerate the arbitrary failure of some component servers, e.g., see <ref> [Sch90, Mar90, RB94] </ref>. Such techniques of which we are aware typically require that all servers receive and process all client accesses, and thus they exhibit high load.

Reference-contexts: A public key certificate is a structure containing a name for a user and a public key, and represents the assertion that the indicated public key can be used to authenticate messages from the indicated user. This structure is digitally signed (e.g., <ref> [RSA78] </ref>) by a certification authority so that anyone with the public key of this authority can verify this assertion and, providing it trusts the authority, use the indicated public key to authenticate the indicated user. <p> Digital signature algorithms are well-known (e.g., <ref> [RSA78] </ref>). In the remainder of this section, we use m u to denote 17 the message m signed by server u. The use of digital signatures results in an Update protocol that exchanges significantly less messages than the protocol in Figure 3. This protocol is shown in 1.

Reference-contexts: In their constructions, replicated data is stored encrypted under a key that is shared among the servers using a threshold secret-sharing scheme <ref> [Sha79] </ref>, and each client accesses a threshold number of servers to reconstruct the key prior to performing (encrypted) reads and writes.
