Abstract: This paper deals with communication in task-sharing between two autonomous six-legged robots equipped with object and goal sensing, and a repertoire of contact and light-following behaviors. The performance of pushing an elongated box toward a goal region is difficult for a single robot and improves significantly when performed cooperatively, but requires careful coordination between the robots. We present and experimentally demonstrate an approach that utilizes cooperation at three levels: sensing, action, and control, and takes advantage of a simple communication protocol to compensate for the robots' noisy and uncertain sensing.

Reference-contexts: Each is 30 cm long and 15 cm high, equipped with two whiskers, five pyroelectric sensors, and the communication hardware, mounted on top. In the shown experiments, the two robots are connected with a 5-meter communication cable. and computation, programmed in the Behavior Language based on the Subsumption Architecture <ref> (Brooks 1986) </ref>. The dynamics of legged robot pushing are less well understood than those of more common wheeled locomotion. When perpendicular to the box, the robots "push" it with their whiskers.

Reference-contexts: Our work addresses the latter approach. Using an implicit model for control effects the extent to which each agent models the other (s) in order to effectively interact. Since maintaining explicit models of the other agent's internal and external state and goals has a computational, sensory, and communication overhead <ref> (Gasser & Huhns 1989, Rosenschein & Genesereth 1985) </ref>, our previous work on collective robot behavior (Mataric 1994, Mataric 1992) demonstrated that certain effective group behaviors can be achieved without explicit models.

Reference-contexts: We experimentally demonstrate that our box-pushing scenarios falls into the class of problems in which communication can produce superlinear performance improvements on problems that otherwise allow only linear speed-up with cooperative solutions <ref> (Huberman 1990) </ref>. We give strong evidence that single-robot and non communicating two-robot solutions are inferior, in terms of performance, compared to the communication and turn-taking protocol given in this paper. 2 Experimental Environment We used two commercially available Genghis-II six-legged robots in our experiments (Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: From a theoretical standpoint, box-pushing fl Real World Computing Partnership is a variant on the canonical object manipulation problem that draws on issues in fine motion as well as high level planning and control. Box-pushing is related to the well-known "piano-movers problem" <ref> (Schwartz & Sharir 1983) </ref>, in that it requires the achievement of the top-level goal of delivering the box to a particular location, as well as the maintenance of low-level requirements including obstacle avoidance, maintaining contact with the box, and maintaining forward motion.
