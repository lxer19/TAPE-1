Abstract: The so called weak form of the Hilbert's Nullstellensatz says that a system of algebraic equations over a field, Q i (x) = 0, does not have a solution in the algebraic closure iff 1 is in the ideal generated by the polynomials Q i (x). We shall prove a lower bound on the degrees of polynomials P i (x) such that This result has the following application. The modular counting principle states that no finite set whose cardinality is not divisible by q can be partitioned into q-element classes. For each fixed cardi-nality N , this principle can be expressed as a propositional formula Count N p , m 6 0 (mod p). We give a new proof of this theorem based on the lower bound for the Hilbert's Nullstellensatz. Furthermore our technique enables us to extend the independence results for counting principles to composite numbers p and q. This improved lower bound

Reference-contexts: Problem Assume s; r 2 and assume r does not divide s. Are there polyno mial size, constant-depth Frege proofs of Count r from instances of formulas in Count s ? If so, under what circumstances do they exist? This was solved in the negative by Ajtai <ref> [4, 3] </ref> for the case when r; s are two different primes. We give a new proof of a strengthened version of his theorem that gives a complete characterization of this problem. Let symbol (a; b) denote the greatest common divisor of a and b.
