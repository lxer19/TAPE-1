Title: Engineering VBR Traffic Parameters for WAN Voice  
Author: Jonathan D. Rosenberg 
Affiliation: Lucent Technologies, Bell Laboratories  
Abstract: A BSTRACT Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) supports a number of different traffic classes, including Constant Bit Rate (CBR), Available Bit Rate (ABR), and Variable Bit Rate (VBR). Applications wishing to use a particular class must determine the set of traffic parameters which characterize the connection. In this paper, we consider how to engineer the traffic parameters for VBR WAN voice, where multiple voice streams, utilizing compression and silence detection, are multiplexed into a single virtual circuit. We define two criteria which the VBR parameters must satisfy: 1) Achievement of a desired probability of cell marking/loss by a leaky bucket policer, and 2) Maximization of admission probabilities to the network. We compute the parameters for two vastly different systems and admission controllers. In either case, we observe a similar trend in the admission probabilities, and propose a method for choosing specific values of the VBR parameters.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we consider one particular application: VBR WAN Voice. In this application, many voice connections are multiplexed together into a single virtual circuit (VC). Each voice connection utilizes silence suppression and compression (via codecs such as PCM <ref> [ 1] </ref>, ADPCM [2], or LD-CELP [3], for example). The silence suppression causes each voice stream to be of the on-off character, and so the resulting multiplexed stream has a variable bitrate. There are several situations where such applications arise.

Reference-contexts: The use of a single VC for all the voice connections has numerous advantages; reduction of packetization delay, improvement of error performance, and statistical multiplexing gains. In fact, T1S1 and the ATM Forum are currently developing a new AAL, called AAL-CU <ref> [ 4] </ref>, for just such an application. Another scenario for such an application arises in the interconnection of mobile base stations and switching centers via ATM. Each base station collects calls from the mobiles in their cell destined for the switching center.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the choice of leaky bucket parameters has no direct consequences on the end-to-end delay. There is a great corpus of material analyzing the effectiveness of the leaky bucket as a control mechanism <ref> [ 5] </ref>,[6],[7]. There have also been a few publications in the area of engineering these parameters; see [ 8] for an example. However, much of this literature (and [8] in particular) has engineered these parameters for control purposes.

In other words, the parameters are chosen so that the loss probability is some value when the user sends at a particular rate, and the loss increases to some other value when the rate increases by a certain percentage. 2.

Reference-contexts: The result of this loss of information is that switches must assume something about the source. It is generally thought that the on-at-PCR, then off type behavior described above is the worst case behavior (in terms of size of the admissable region) for a given leaky-bucket conformant stream <ref> [ 9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Source Characterization The first step in determination of the parameters is to meet criteria 1: matching the source behavior. Our model for the source is based on the assumption of the twostate, on-off, Markov model for each voice user first pioneered by Brady in <ref> [10] </ref>. When on, each user sends at a rate of P cells/s. The transition rate from on to off is a , and the transition rate from off to on is l .

Reference-contexts: The transition rate from on to off is a , and the transition rate from off to on is l . The aggregation of N such users into a single connection can then be modeled by the N+1 state birth-death process depicted in <ref> [11] </ref>, Figure 3. It is well known that the performance of the leaky bucket can be modeled as a G/D/1 queue. In such a model, the source loads a queue whose depth is equal to the leaky bucket depth, and whose deterministic service times equal 1 over the SCR.

Reference-contexts: In this application, the G is in fact a Markov-Modulated Deterministic Process (MMDP), so the queuing problem becomes that of the MMDP/D/1 queue. We use the fluid-flow analysis described in <ref> [ 12] </ref>, and approximate the overflow probability (and thus the cell loss probability at an equivalent policer) by the dominant- eigenvalue term in the solution.

Reference-contexts: The next step is to further constrain SCR and B T by taking into account the admission controller. 4. Separate Buffers In this section, we consider an admission controller described by Elwalid, Mitra, and Wentworth in <ref> [13] </ref>. In that paper, they assume worst case behavior from a leaky bucket. To each virtual connection passing through the switch, they individually allocate a certain amount of buffer, and a certain amount of bandwidth. <p> Care must be taken however; the two equations do not always have a solution. This is because the bandwidth e cannot be less than r, the drain rate of the leaky bucket. This is illustrated graphically in Figure 3 (which is identical to Fig. 5 from <ref> [ 13] </ref>). The line emanating from the origin corresponds to the constraint described above. The other line corresponds to the relationship between b and e required to guarantee stability. <p> The value for b can then be set at B T , or at r g . The latter choice is easier to administrate, as it applies whether or not the two lines intersect <ref> [13] </ref>. With this in mind, the system of equations is readily solved.

Reference-contexts: To each virtual connection passing through the switch, they individually allocate a certain amount of buffer, and a certain amount of bandwidth. Each queue (and its VC) are assumed to be served by a perfect fluid GPS server <ref> [ 14] </ref>. The result of this is complete isolation of one connection from any other. Based on some simple relationships between the buffering and bandwidth, they obtain a solution for the allocation which maximizes the admissable region. The discussion which follows summarizes their results.

Reference-contexts: The model in this section is that of a large shared buffer of depth B, served by a link of rate C. All cells entering the switch enter the buffer and are served in FIFO order. The admission controller is based on the equivalent capacity concept detailed in <ref> [15] </ref>. Here again, the switch does not know the nature of the source, and will assume the worst-case, on-off model detailed above.
