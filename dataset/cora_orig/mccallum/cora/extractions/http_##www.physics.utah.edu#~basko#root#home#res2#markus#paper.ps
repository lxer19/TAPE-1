Abstract: We have applied action spectrum spectroscopy to the photoinduced absorption band of triplet excitons (TE) in PPV, mLPPP and PDA to obtain the TE quantum effiency spectra. These spectra show in all three cases TE pho-togeneration with an onset at the optical gap, but in addition to that they show a second onset of photogeneration at excitation energies larger than the optical gap. This second onset is explained by singlet exciton fission into triplet pairs. We introduce a model to fit the spectra and obtain the TE energy as a fitting parameter. We have used far from steady state action spectrum spectroscopy [1] to obtain the QE vs. E spectra, where QE is the TE quantum efficiency and E the excitation photon energy, in films of poly(para-phenylene-vinylene) PPV, methyl-bridged ladder-type poly(para-phenylene) mLPPP and poly(di-acetylene) PDA. We found that whereas the photoluminescence (PL) QE comprises of a step-function response at E close to the optical gap, E op , of these materials, the QE for TE (Fig. 1, 2, 3) in addition to that contains a monotonous rise at E&gt;E op . It is thus apparent that TE generation occurs via two main processes. The first process is associated with the generation of thermalized singlet excitons and therefore has a similar E dependence as that of P L [1]. The other process, with an onset at E&gt;E op is therefore due to hot excitons and must thus

Reference-contexts: But for all three PCP we would then get T2&gt;S2, where S2 is the energy of the first excited singlet exciton, as obtained e.g. by electroabsorption [?,?,?]. The theoretical prediction for the SF QE (E) spectrum is a step function response with an onset of 2E T <ref> [3] </ref>. But our spectra (Fig. 1) do not show this sharp step function response, but the rise prior to reaching a plateau is spread out over several tens of eV.

Reference-contexts: The fit through the data points has been obtained by a model describing SF, that we want to introduce in this paper.

We give the following argument against this interpretation: This UEST is strongest when the singlet exciton is excited with an E equal to the energy T2 of the excited TE [5] or higher, since it can always relax to lower energies. It would thus be possible the read out T2 as the E where the QE reaches its plateau (maximum)(Fig. 1, 2, 3).
