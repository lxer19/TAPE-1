Reference-contexts: Unreliable protocols such as UDP will perform poorly if packets are transmitted when signal quality is bad. A mechanism by which unnecessary loss of packets can be avoided by allowing transmission only under "good" link conditions is presented in <ref> [2] </ref>. 10 In general, end-to-end protocols need information about the state of the wireless link. The decision of what to do under a given condition can be taken at various layers such as device level, IP level and transport level. <p> Additionally, he can place different filters which will allow only certain important pieces of e-mail to be downloaded to the clients machine. The opportunistic nature of transmission is discussed in <ref> [2] </ref> and the general model of communication under varying conditions in [4]. Mobile applications need support for obtaining the state of the current environment and any changes that may occur as the mobile host moves. As resource availability changes so should the 11 applications need for resources.

Reference-contexts: Proxies residing at foreign agents require careful mobility management especially for users who change locations very often. The preliminary work using the applications of the proxy model to the remote procedure call (rpc) is discussed in <ref> [3] </ref>. 12 2.3 Infostations The objective of this project [20] is to develop architecture, software, protocol, and radio support for infostations pockets of high bit rate wireless connectivity [20]. Infostations will serve as information kiosks for mobile users equipped with terminals with wireless connection.

Reference-contexts: Thus, TCP instead of "trying harder" when facing the packet loss, backs off which is a correct behavior in case of congestion but degrades throughput on the wireless link. Bakre and Badrinath [23], [22], <ref> [5] </ref> implemented I-TCP, indirect TCP which splits the TCP connection into two pieces: one on the fixed network between the sender and the MSS and another on the wireless link between the MSS and the moble client.

Reference-contexts: In databases disconnection is handled typically in the context of long term transactions. * Power Considerations Energy is an important constraint due to the battery life limitations. As pointed out by <ref> [6] </ref>, the battery life is not expected to increase more than 20 percent in the next 10 years. Hardware manufacturers are providing hardware solutions such as spinning down the disk and switching off the screen. It is necessary now to provide energy efficient software solutions.

Reference-contexts: The former mode has been called publishing mode [11] as well as "disk on air" [17], since information is periodically broadcasted as if placed on the rotating disk. Earlier work on publishing mode in wired environments has been described in <ref> [7] </ref> and [8]. In [11], [18], [19], [12], [16] we have investigated issues of data organization, addressing and scheduling in a situation when the server is periodically broadcasting information and clients are listening to the broadcasted downstream, and filtering information which is relevant to their needs.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, location is an important parameter in location dependent applications. Finally, location and mobility play a central role in geo graphic messaging <ref> [10] </ref>, which we discuss later in this paper. * Widely varying communication conditions: Fading, Noise and Interference This requires adaptive solutions on all layers of the OSI hierarchy, handling failures and disconnections. <p> We study the following general families of solutions: * Multicast solution * Unicast IP routing extended to deal with GPS addresses * Application Layer Solution using extended DNS Here we discuss only the first solution the complete discussion is provided in <ref> [10] </ref> We will assume a general cellular architecture with base stations called Mobile Support Stations (MSS). We will consider a wide variety of cells, including outdoor and indoor cells. <p> The future version of IP (IP v6) will certainly have sufficient number of bits in its addressing space to provide a multicast address for even smaller GPS addressable units. In <ref> [10] </ref> however, we assume the current version of IP (IP v4) and we make sure that we manage the addressing space more economically than that. By GPS square we mean the smallest GPS addressable unit. <p> In particular, when there is only one designated router per partition, there 7 would only be one aggregate link in any router. This could lead to nonoptimal routing but will solve the problem of redundant links <ref> [10] </ref>. We still have to describe what happens when a message reaches the MSS. There is a number of alternatives and again we only discuss one of them here, The MSS compares the polygon coordinates in the message with the range of its own cell. <p> Then the full message is multicasted by the MSS on that multicast address. The detailed nature of the mapping from atoms and partitions to multicast addresses is described in <ref> [10] </ref>. In [10] we also discuss two other methods of delivering geographic messaging: geometric routing and domain server solution. <p> Then the full message is multicasted by the MSS on that multicast address. The detailed nature of the mapping from atoms and partitions to multicast addresses is described in <ref> [10] </ref>. In [10] we also discuss two other methods of delivering geographic messaging: geometric routing and domain server solution. <p> A prototype implementation is carried through at the Rutgers Campus. 2.1.4 Distance Based Services The location awareness enabled by GPS allows support for distance based services which are located within a certain distance &gt;from the mobile client. In <ref> [10] </ref> we propose the following simple solution allowing: * Servers to advertise their services within a certain distance from their current location 2 * Clients to request services only within the certain distance &gt;from their current location. <p> Addressing Based on the Client's Location Location is an important special case of data attribute which is a likely candidate to be used in data filtering. In <ref> [10] </ref> we have proposed a way of delivering IP datagrams to the specific geographic locations defined as polygons specified as sequences of GPS coordinates. A similar, though much simpler, scheme may be used to deliver information which is only of interest to users who are located in a particular area.

Reference-contexts: Data from the database is offered to clients in two basic forms: spontaneous, possibly periodic, broadcast (such as broadcast TV) and the demand driven form (i.e. per request, such as standard client server).

Reference-contexts: The future PCN (Personal Communication Network) assumes a wide variety of cells starting from very small picocells coexisting with larger, macrocells which may even include satellite radio [25]. We argue in <ref> [13] </ref> that the following features of the mobile environment will have a critical impact on the software design issues for mobile computing: * Massively Distributed Architecture The concept of a cellular architecture aimed at efficient frequency reuse implies a massively distributed system architecture.

Reference-contexts: Before we do that we will briefly summarize the key research challenges brought by the mobile and wireless environment. 1.1 Research Challenges Here we provide only a brief overview of the new research issues arising in mobile computing. For more elaborate discussion the reader is referred to [16], <ref> [14] </ref>, [15]. We will assume here the basic architecture of the mobile environment which consists of MSS (Mobile Support Stations) base stations with limited radio coverage. <p> Additionally, charges may depend on the time of the day and even on the distance from the base station. The type of tariff will have strong impact on the software running on he client machine different solutions will be used for different types of tariffs. For example <ref> [14] </ref> prefetching will be used aggressively, when charges are based on connection time, while it will be avoided when charges are based on the number of packets exchanged. Our own work within DataMan project deals with most of the issues described above.

For more elaborate discussion the reader is referred to <ref> [16] </ref>, [14], [15]. We will assume here the basic architecture of the mobile environment which consists of MSS (Mobile Support Stations) base stations with limited radio coverage. <p> For example a number of proposals to extend TCP to better handle wireless environments are based on the concept of a TCP proxy which resides on the MSS <ref> [16] </ref>. Other important issue with far reaching impact on file systems and databases is disconnection, Disconnection can be viewed as prepared or voluntary failure. CODA, Locus and other distributed file systems were the first to deal with the disconnection on the file system level. <p> Hardware manufacturers are providing hardware solutions such as spinning down the disk and switching off the screen. It is necessary now to provide energy efficient software solutions. Some initial work in this direction is provided by Weiser (included in <ref> [16] </ref>). * Varying Tariff Structures The future tariff structure for wireless information services is far &gt;from clear yet. Basically, charges can be proportional to the connection time, number of packets sent or received, or simply could be flat up to a certain limit. <p> The former mode has been called publishing mode [11] as well as "disk on air" [17], since information is periodically broadcasted as if placed on the rotating disk. Earlier work on publishing mode in wired environments has been described in [7] and [8].

However, data on the broadcast channel has to be suitably organized and addressed to allow clients efficient filtering of the incoming data stream to avoid "listening all the time". In <ref> [16] </ref> we have distinguished two basic methods of addressing information: by using timestamps of information arrival and by using multicast addressing. Additionally, the information which is more important and which is expected to be of interest more often is broadcasted more frequently. <p> However, for smaller files and less frequent retransmissions we can assign more logical subchannels. Scheduling can be based on the anticipated rate of request for a given data item. The more frequently requested data items will be broadcasted more frequently <ref> [16] </ref>, [17]. Additionally, as [16] explains scheduling will be based on the priority levels as well as on the quality of service guarantees such as access time. In general, a scheduling specification will be expressed as a set of rules describing priorities and desired frequencies of broadcast. <p> However, for smaller files and less frequent retransmissions we can assign more logical subchannels.

In [18] we argue that solutions which require the server to maintain the precise state of the clients, including information who is disconnected, are impractical due to mobility of the clients. <p> In general, disconnection will be a feature not a bug in the wireless environment and it will be a major factor that will affect caching solutions <ref> [18] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Digital modulation of this type is referred to as Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK) or On Off keying. If the antenna is small, it will be highly resonant and will provide a degree of frequency band selectivity with no additional filtering <ref> [21] </ref> This technology is also capable of providing a very low cost uplink, albeit at a lower data rate than the downlink. The uplink is achieved through "modulated backscatter", in which an unmodulated carrier from the infostation is modulated by the mobile and reflected back to the infostation.

Additionally, location is an important parameter in location dependent applications. <p> Important issue is whether proxies will move along with users or whether they will stay in the same location.
