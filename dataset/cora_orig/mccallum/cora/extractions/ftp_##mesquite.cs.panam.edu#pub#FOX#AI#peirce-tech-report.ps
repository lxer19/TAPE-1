Reference-contexts: There seem to be many other potential algorithms for accomplishing the abductive task, from using Bayes' theorem on a set of hypotheses and findings and their associated probabilities and generating the most probable hypotheses for the given findings <ref> [4, 13] </ref>, to a logic-based approach where hypotheses are assumptions that are introduced as needed in order to explain the data [6, 18]. We opt for a very simple yet powerful algorithm which tends towards the framed-based approach of others like [19].

Reference-contexts: 1 We distinguish this Peirce from a similar tool named PEIRCE constructed by William Punch here at the OSU LAIR who is now at the Knowledge Based Systems Lab at Michigan State University <ref> [15] </ref>. The IGTT extension is to note that this Peirce is a piece of the Integrated Generic Task Toolset. From this point on, we will simply call Peirce-IGTT as Peirce without the extension. 1 is added to a growing composite of hypotheses until all symptoms/findings are explained. <p> Peirce later became a piece of the Toolset after being overhauled and rewritten by Diana Smetters and Hari Narayaran [7].

Reference-contexts: The trial in San Diego ended on February 27, 1988 in a hung jury. Our case description comes from Paul Thagard's breakdown of the case which he illustrates in <ref> [23] </ref>. We have chosen this example because it has already been implemented by Paul Thagard in his Echo system [23]. We use Thagard's own breakdown of the problem and simply encode it into a Peirce abducer. <p> The trial in San Diego ended on February 27, 1988 in a hung jury.

In addition, Thagard has no way to provide a trace of his system's reasoning based solely on his system; he would need to implement an explanation program (if possible) on top of his Echo system.
