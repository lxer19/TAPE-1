Abstract: A restricted-orientation convex set is a set of points whose intersection with lines from some fixed set is empty or connected. This notion generalizes both standard convexity and orthogonal convexity. We explore basic properties of restricted-orientation convex sets in three dimensions. In particular, we establish analogs of the following properties of standard convex sets: * The intersection of a convex set with every line is empty or connected

Reference-contexts: Our goal is to study nontraditional convexities in three and higher dimensions. We have generalized two different types of restricted-orientation convexity, called strong convexity and O-convexity [7], to higher-dimensional spaces and presented an extensive study of restricted-orientation convex sets in higher dimensions <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. In this paper, we describe O-convex sets in three dimensions and give some of their basic properties.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The study of convex sets is a branch of geometry that has numerous connections with other areas of mathematics, including analysis, linear algebra, statistics, and combinatorics <ref> [4] </ref>. Its importance stems from the fact that convex sets arise in many areas of mathematics and are often amenable to rather elementary reasoning. The concept of convexity serves to unify a wide range of mathematical phenomena.
