Abstract: We show that the Hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-complete for a class of planar graphs named triangle graphs that are closely related to inner-triangulated graphs. We present a linear-time heuristic algorithm that finds a solution at most one-third longer than the optimum solution and use it to obtain a fast rendering algorithm on triangular meshes in computer graphics.

Reference-contexts: A three-colorable class of graphs called triangle graphs, closely related to inner-triangulated graphs was defined and their application to the parallel finite element solution of elliptic partial differential equations on triangulated domains was discussed in [2]. The efficiency of high-performance rendering machines (such as OpenGL <ref> [1] </ref> and IGL [4]) on triangular meshes in computer graphics is proportional to the rate at which triangulation data is sent to it.

Ordering the triangles so that consecutive triangles share a face reduces the data rate by a factor of three since now, only one vertex per triangle need be specified.

It is easy to see that our algorithm is linear in the number of triangle elements of the given triangle graph (and therefore, linear in the number of its vertices, n) and needs only O (n) computer space.
