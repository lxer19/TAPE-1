Abstract: PC-ATOMIC Final Report 1 PC-ATOMIC ABSTRACT: PC-ATOMIC is a PC interface for the ATOMIC LAN. PC-ATOMIC is implemented as a VL-Bus (VESA) short-form card for Intel i486 PCs, providing an interface for low-cost workstations to a 640 Mbps LAN. This document describes the PC-ATOMIC interface, its design, capabilities, and performance. The board design is public, and a small number of boards are available as government-furnished equipment for PC-ATOMIC is an Intel i486 PC VL-Bus host interface for the ATOMIC LAN [5] [6]. It provides an inexpensive interface for inexpensive hosts to a high-speed (640 Mbps) LAN. It provides a read bandwidth of 85 Mbps, and a write bandwidth of 135 Mbps, both using programmed I/O. The board architecture can support DMA if reprogrammed at the PLD-level. It also provides a zero-overhead, maskable IP-checksum in hardware. This board can be used point-to-point, or together with Myricoms Myrinet switches and SPARC S-Bus host interfaces. PC-ATOMIC is compatible at the hardware link-layer with Myricom equipment. research projects.

Reference-contexts: This bit is also automatically set when the entire board is reset. There are also bits to set and mask various interrupts to the host and LANai. The IP checksum register maintains a partial Internet checksum <ref> [1] </ref>. All data accesses are incrementally summed into this register when checksumming is enabled (as per a bit in the control register). This includes data reads and writes, and both programmed I/O and DMA are included.

Reference-contexts: Government. PC-ATOMIC Final Report 2 ATOMIC is a source-routed, cut-through packet-switched LAN based on the components of the CalTech Mosaic supercomputer <ref> [4] </ref>. The Mosaic supercomputer uses custom VLSI 16-bit processors with integrated 2-dimensional communication channels, arranged in a mesh. The Mosaic channels are 8-bits wide, at 100 Mhz, for a channel rate of 800 Mbps. Packet routing is performed in simple on-chip hardware.

Some performance test programs are also included. 3.0 Performance The PC-ATOMIC card has been tested in point-to-point mode to other PC-ATOMIC cards, and to Myricom 1.2 and 2.3 Sun SPARC SBus host interfaces <ref> [5] </ref>. The PC-ATOMIC card supports programmed I/O at 88 Mbps. The testing found zero errors over 10 million packets. The tests were: i486 on-board loopback (pre-driver and post-driver) i486 to i486 i486 to Myricom S-Bus interface.

Reference-contexts: Using a half-rate VL-Bus clock simplifies the design significantly. 2.1 Board-level hardware The PC-ATOMIC board is memory-mapped, making control and OS integration simple. Board control is managed by a set of board-level registers and interface processor registers, as well as dual-access shared RAM <ref> [7] </ref>. PC-ATOMIC Final Report 3 FIGURE 2.

PC-ATOMIC Final Report 3 FIGURE 2. PC-ATOMIC board component layout The board has a set of configuration jumpers, one for setting the boards hardware base address, and the other for setting the Myricom link interface [7]. The link interface jumpers are specified in the Myricom literature, and come pre-configured by ISI. The address jumpers specify a block of 2^24 bytes (16 Mbytes), in the 00xx xxxx - 0Fxx xxxx range (i.e., the lower nibble of the high byte of the 32-bit address). <p> The base of RAM is the start location for the on-board processor following a reset. FIGURE 3. Board memory layout 2.1.1 Board-level configuration The board contains a LANai 1.2 subsystem, nearly identical to that on the prototype Myricom 1.2 Sun SPARC SBus host interfaces <ref> [7] </ref>. The LANai uses a separate on-board crystal to control the link clocking, which is set to 40 Mhz for compatibility with the current Myrinet switches.

Reference-contexts: 41MM cable driver chips, and installation of a half-twisted ribbon connecting two 26-pin headers in the pre-driver header sockets. 2.1.2 Board registers There are five main board registers which provide for Internet checksum, board-level reset, interface-processor reset-and-hold/release, maskable interrupts, and DMA control (DMA can be supported in future firmware releases) <ref> [8] </ref>. The control register provides general board-level management. Bits in the register can be used to: Suspend the DMA engine Enable/disable IP checksumming (on both PI/O and DMA) Reset/release the LANai reset Mask and set interrupts The DMA engine can be suspended via a single bit in the mask.

Reference-contexts: The preliminary ATOMIC LAN components were designed by CalTech, and programmed by ISI. In 1994, members of ISIs ATOMIC group and CalTechs Mosaic group left their respective organizations to form Myricom to develop the ATOMIC LAN as a commercial product called Myrinet <ref> [9] </ref>. Myrinet components are not compatible with the prototype ATOMIC LAN, but are based on the same design principles. Myrinet is 8 bits wide at 80 Mbps per line, for a channel rate of 640 Mbps. Myricom currently produces host interfaces for Sun SPARC workstations, cables, and switches.

Reference-contexts: The Internet checksum was implemented in a very inexpensive part at gigabit rates (Appendix A). This provided a zero-overhead checksum during any DMA and P I/O operations. Subsequent research considered the replacement of this checksum with an IPv6 header authentication algorithm <ref> [10] </ref>. DMA capability is part of the PC-ATOMIC design. It has not been fully tested, due to OS limitations. The PLDs can be reprogrammed to enable DMA, and other data paths that are part of the board design (Appendix B). This includes LANai control of the board-level registers. 1.
