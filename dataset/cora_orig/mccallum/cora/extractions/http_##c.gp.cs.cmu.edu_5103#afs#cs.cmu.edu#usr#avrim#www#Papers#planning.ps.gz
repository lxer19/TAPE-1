Abstract: We introduce a new approach to planning in STRIPS-like domains based on constructing and analyzing a compact structure we call a Planning Graph. We describe a new planner, Graphplan, that uses this paradigm. Graphplan always returns a shortest-possible partial-order plan, or states that no valid plan exists. We provide empirical evidence in favor of this approach, showing that Graphplan outperforms the total-order planner, Prodigy, and the partial-order planner, UCPOP, on a variety of interesting natural and artificial planning problems. We also give empirical evidence that the plans produced by Graphplan are quite sensible. Since searches made by this approach are fundamentally different from the searches of other common planning methods, they provide a new perspective on the planning problem.

Reference-contexts: When it considers an action, it considers it at a specific point in time: for instance, it might consider placing the action `move Rocket1 from London to Paris' in a plan at exactly time-step 2. On the other hand, like partial-order planners <ref> [ Chapman, 1987 ] </ref>[ McAllester and Rosenblitt, 1991 ][ Barrett and Weld, 1994 ][ Weld, 1994 ] , Graphplan generates partially ordered plans.

Reference-contexts: Nonetheless, perhaps algorithms for the max-flow problem | and there are many fast algorithms known <ref> [ Cormen et al., 1990, Goldberg and Tarjan, 1986 ] </ref> | might be useful for guiding the planning process. Empirically, we found that an approach based solely on max-flow algorithms did not perform as well as the method of backward-chaining with mutual exclusion relations described in this paper.

Reference-contexts: Conceptually this is a kind of "parallel" plan <ref> [ Knoblock, 1994 ] </ref> , since one could imagine executing the actions in three time steps if one had as many workers as needed to load and unload and fly the rockets.
