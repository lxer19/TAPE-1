Abstract: AI researchers are striving to build complex multi-agent worlds with intended applications ranging from the RoboCup robotic soccer tournaments, to interactive virtual theatre, to large-scale real-world battlefield simulations. Agent tracking monitoring other agent's actions and inferring their higher-level goals and intentions is a central requirement in such worlds. While previous work has mostly focused on tracking individual agents, this paper goes beyond by focusing on agent teams. Team tracking poses the challenge of tracking a team's joint goals and plans. Dynamic, real-time environments add to the challenge, as ambiguities have to be resolved in real-time. The central hypothesis underlying the present work is that an explicit team-oriented perspective enables effective team tracking. This hypothesis is instantiated using the model tracing technology employed in tracking individual agents. Thus, to track team activities, team models are put to service. Team models are a concrete application of the joint intentions framework and enable an agent to track team activities, regardless of the agent's being a collaborative participant or a non-participant in the team. To facilitate real-time ambiguity resolution with team models: (i) aspects of tracking are cast as constraint satisfaction problems to exploit constraint propagation techniques; and (ii) a cost minimality criterion is applied to constrain tracking search. Empirical results from two separate tasks in real-world, dynamic environments one collaborative and one competitive are provided.

Reference-contexts: Introduction In many multi-agent domains, the interaction among intelligent agents collaborative or non-collaborative is both dynamic and real-time. For instance, in education, intelligent tutoring systems interact with students to provide real-time feedback <ref> (Anderson et al. 1990) </ref>. In entertainment, projects such as virtual immersive environments (Maes et al. 1994) and virtual theatre (Hayes-Roth, Brownston, & Gen 1995) involve real-time and dynamic interaction. <p> We assume some familiarity with Soar's problem solving, specifically, applying operators to states to reach a desired state (Newell 1990). RESC: Tracking Individual Agents The RESC (REal-time Situated Commitments) approach to agent tracking (Tambe & Rosenbloom 1995) builds on model tracing <ref> (Anderson et al. 1990) </ref>. Here, a tracker executes a model of the trackee (the agent being tracked), matching the model's predictions with observations of the trackee's actions. One key innovation in RESC is the use of commitments.

Reference-contexts: As a concrete basis for the above discussion, consider the following example of real-world teamwork a typical simulated air-combat scenario (Figure 1), from a real-world combat simulation environment <ref> (Calder et al. 1993) </ref>. Here, a pilot agent D confronts a team of four enemy fighters J, K, L and M. In Figure 1-a, D detects the four opponents turning towards its aircraft, and infers that they are approaching it with hostile intent. <p> Team models and RESC team are applicable for tracking even if an agent is a collaborative participant in the team. Consider the scenario in Figure 3-c, which shows a team of simulated helicopters executing its mission (Tambe, Schwamb, & Rosenbloom 1995), again in the real-world combat simulation environment <ref> (Calder et al. 1993) </ref>. Helicopter radio communications are often restricted to avoid detection by enemy. It is thus essential for a helicopter pilot agent to infer relevant information from the actions of its teammates, e.g., the team has reached a pre-specified holding area since teammates have begun hovering.

Reference-contexts: The key in tracking such teamwork is to recognize that it is not merely a union of individual simultaneous activity, even if coordinated (Grosz & Sidner 1990; Cohen & Levesque 1991). For instance, ordinary automobile traffic is not considered teamwork, despite the simultaneous activity, coordinated by traffic signs <ref> (Cohen & Levesque 1991) </ref>. Teamwork involves team members' joint goals and joint intentions, i.e., joint commitments to joint activities (Cohen & Levesque 1991). Consequently, tracking teamwork as independent activities of individual members is difficult. <p> For instance, ordinary automobile traffic is not considered teamwork, despite the simultaneous activity, coordinated by traffic signs <ref> (Cohen & Levesque 1991) </ref>. Teamwork involves team members' joint goals and joint intentions, i.e., joint commitments to joint activities (Cohen & Levesque 1991). Consequently, tracking teamwork as independent activities of individual members is difficult. Consider the example of two children collabo-ratively building a tower of blocks (Grosz & Sidner 1990) they cannot be tracked as building two individual towers of blocks with gaps in just the right places. <p> Indeed, team tracking based on team models is among the first practical applications of the joint intentions theory developed in formalizing teamwork <ref> (Cohen & Levesque 1991) </ref>. The paper shows that team models are uniformly applicable in tracking even if an agent is a participant in a team, rather than a nonparticipant. <p> The Joint Intentions Framework While team tracking has received little attention in the literature, researchers are investigating teamwork (Grosz & Sid-ner 1990; Cohen & Levesque 1991; Kinny et al. 1992). One leading theory of teamwork is the joint intentions framework <ref> (Cohen & Levesque 1991) </ref>. Very briefly, this theory states that a team jointly intends an activity if it is jointly committed to completing that activity (commitments have a common escape clause q).

Reference-contexts: The key to this capability is tracking an agent's flexible and reactive behaviors in dynamic, multi-agent domains. This contrasts with previous work in the related area of plan recognition <ref> (Kautz & Allen 1986) </ref>, which mostly focuses on static, single-agent domains. This paper takes a step beyond tracking individual agents the current state of the art in agent tracking and plan-recognition by focusing on team tracking.

Reference-contexts: For instance, in the game of bridge, opponents' bidding team operator has two roles, e.g., NORTH and SOUTH. The pincer team operator in Figure 1-b has two roles LEFT and RIGHT. While the notion of roles has previously appeared in the context of teamwork <ref> (Kinny et al. 1992) </ref>, it is exploited here via the specification of a role coherency constraint, i.e., there must be one subteam per role for the performance of the team operator. However, roles for a single operator need not all be distinct.

Reference-contexts: Such interaction is also seen in robotic domains, e.g., collaboration by observation (Ku-niyoshi et al. 1994), RoboCup soccer <ref> (Kitano et al. 1995) </ref>. In all these environments, agent tracking monitoring other agents' observable actions and inferring their high-level goals, plans and behaviors is a central capability required for intelligent interaction (Anderson et al. 1990; Rao 1994; Tambe & Rosenbloom 1995). <p> It is only natural that this teamwork is (and will be) reflected in virtual and robotic agent worlds, e.g., robotic collaboration by observation (Kuniyoshi et al. 1994), RoboCup soccer <ref> (Kitano et al. 1995) </ref>, virtual theatre (Hayes-Roth, Brownston, & Gen 1995), virtual battlefields (Tambe et al. 1995). If agents are to successfully inhabit such worlds, they must understand and track team activity. <p> Another issue for future work is tracking (apparantely) ill-structured team activity. To this end, we are currently testing RESC team in RoboCup soccer simulation <ref> (Kitano et al. 1995) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Observations of subteam actions provide dynamic unary constraints. Unifying role combinations and casting the problem as a CSP provides several benefits. First, while detecting match failures is the simplest consistency check (node consistency), other constraint propagation techniques such as arc consistency or path-consistency <ref> (Kumar 1992) </ref> can accelerate the process of role assignment (or detecting failures). For instance, in Figure 4, if node-consistency rules out the role STRAIGHT for subteam S 2 , then arc-consistency will automatically rule out roles LEFT and RIGHT for S 1 .

Reference-contexts: Similarly, in (RoboCup) soccer, the collaborative pass play of two attackers cannot be tracked as independent activities. Robotic collaboration by observation <ref> (Kuniyoshi et al. 1994) </ref> would also require tracking such joint activities. Thus, team tracking raises the novel challenge of tracking a team's joint goals and intentions. <p> It is only natural that this teamwork is (and will be) reflected in virtual and robotic agent worlds, e.g., robotic collaboration by observation <ref> (Kuniyoshi et al. 1994) </ref>, RoboCup soccer (Kitano et al. 1995), virtual theatre (Hayes-Roth, Brownston, & Gen 1995), virtual battlefields (Tambe et al. 1995). If agents are to successfully inhabit such worlds, they must understand and track team activity.

Reference-contexts: Should this commitment lead to a tracking error, a real-time repair mechanism is invoked. RESC is thus a repair-based approach to tracking (like a repair-based approach to constraint satisfaction <ref> (Minton et al. 1990) </ref>). A second key technique in RESC leads to its situated ness, i.e., ability to track the trackee's dynamic behaviors. A key assumption here is that the tracker is itself capable of the flexible and reactive behaviors required in this environment. <p> So far, only arc-consistency has been incorporated in RESC team . RESC team , being a repair-based approach, solves this CSP via a repair-based approach <ref> (Minton et al. 1990) </ref> it commits to one assignment of roles to subteams, and dynamically repairs inconsistent assignments. Minimum Cost Repair in Tracking Repairing role assignments to subteams is, however, more complex than indicated in the previous section.

Reference-contexts: In Figure 1-a, D detects the four opponents turning towards its aircraft, and infers that they are approaching it with hostile intent. In Figure 1-b, the four opponents split up into two subteams, and begin a pincer maneuver <ref> (Shaw 1988) </ref>. That is, one subteam (J and K) starts turning left, while the other subteam (L and M) starts turning right. Their goal is to trap D in the center, and attack it from two sides. <p> When using individual models, most of the time is spent tracking.) individual models. Time measured in simulation cycles. Focusing only on role-assignment, Table 1 presents the reduction in tracking effort due to team models and CSP (assuming four agents in each tactic). Column 1 names different tactics <ref> (Shaw 1988) </ref>. Column 2 estimates the (worst-case) total number of operators searched assuming roles assigned to individual agents rather than subteams. Column 3 shows the factor reduction in the operators searched when role assignment is based on teams/subteams.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, if a subteam deviates without an explaining event, RESC team assumes team-wide error (applies normal CSP). The pragmatic rationale behind the above heuristic is that it reduces real-time repair expense. Theoretically, it leans towards parsimonious explanations (it is based on minimality of fault models <ref> (Stefik 1995) </ref>). This heuristic is actually already incorporated into individual-agent RESC in that once committed to an interpretation, RESC avoids repairs until failure. Implementation Results and Evaluation We have implemented experimental variants of Soar-based pilot agents for both simulated fighters and helicopters.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the above approaches also fail to address the dynamism in teamwork, particularly, dynamic formation and dissolution of subteams for different subtasks. Some recent work has attempted to go beyond individuals and track multiple agents. One such approach tracks a group of agents engaged in identical activity <ref> (Tambe 1995) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the above approaches also fail to address the dynamism in teamwork, particularly, dynamic formation and dissolution of subteams for different subtasks. Some recent work has attempted to go beyond individuals and track multiple agents. One such approach tracks a group of agents engaged in identical activity <ref> (Tambe 1995) </ref>. Yet, a group (e.g., cars driving in ordinary traffic) differs from a team (e.g., driving in a convoy) precisely due to the lack of any jointness of purpose. Thus, for instance, this approach fails to track teamwork where agents engage in non-identical activities. <p> This abstraction in team models also provides robustness, e.g., changes in number of team members may not disturb tracking. To track with such team models in real-time dynamic environments, we build on the RESC <ref> (Tambe & Rosenbloom 1995) </ref> approach for tracking individual agents. The new approach, RESC team , is aimed at real-time, dynamic team tracking. Before describing team models and RESC team in more detail, the following section first provides an overview of RESC. <p> The new approach, RESC team , is aimed at real-time, dynamic team tracking.

The description below assumes as a concrete basis, pilot agents based on the Soar architecture <ref> (Tambe et al. 1995) </ref>. We assume some familiarity with Soar's problem solving, specifically, applying operators to states to reach a desired state (Newell 1990).
