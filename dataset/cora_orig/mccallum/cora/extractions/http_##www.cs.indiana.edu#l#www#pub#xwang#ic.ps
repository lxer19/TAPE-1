Abstract: This paper presents a sufficient condition on sparsity patterns for the existence of the incomplete Cholesky factorization. Given the sparsity pattern P(A) of a matrix A, and a target sparsity pattern P satisfying the condition, incomplete Cholesky factorization successfully completes for all symmetric positive definite matrices with the same pattern P(A). This condition is also necessary in the sense that for a given P(A) and target pattern P , if P does not satisfy the condition then there is at least one symmetric positive definite matrix B whose Cholesky factor has the same sparsity pattern as the Cholesky factor of A, for which incomplete Cholesky factorization fails because of a nonpositive pivot.

Reference-contexts: A numerical strategy uses numerical values generated during the factorization process to modify the factorization, as in the work by [Jennings and Malik, 1977, Manteuffel, 1979, Munksgaard, 1980, Wittum and Liebau, 1989]. A structural strategy, as in the work by <ref> [Coleman, 1988] </ref>, selects the sparsity pattern to insure the completion of the IC process. In this paper, we do not give any specific algorithm for modifying the sparsity pattern to assure the existence of IC. <p> Relationship to Coleman's Preconditioner. The only other nontrivial condition on the target sparsity pattern that guarantees existence of the IC preconditioner is from Coleman <ref> [Coleman, 1988] </ref>. Coleman reorders the matrix A to have chordal blocks on the diagonal, which can be completely factored without fill-in. In addition to this block diagonal preconditioner, Coleman allows some fill-in by bringing in offdiagonal blocks and explicitly forming and factoring the resulting Schur complement. <p> These results show that property C + is fundamental for incomplete Cholesky factorization. Every other sufficient condition on the sparsity pattern that we know of is a special case of property C + , including the reordered chordal graph strategy in <ref> [Coleman, 1988] </ref> and the trivial cases of P containing only diagonal entries and P = P (U ). Theorem 2 implies that property C + is necessary and sufficient, if only the sparsity pattern of the matrix is considered.

Reference-contexts: This work was originally motivated by research on the incomplete Gram-Schmidt factorization (IGS) of a least squares problem, for which A is the coefficient matrix of the normal equations. The existence of that IGS factorization can be guaranteed <ref> [Wang et al., 1994a] </ref>, and property C + is the condition under which IC applied to A is essentially equivalent to IGS and therefore also guaranteed to exist. Algorithms for modifying a given sparsity pattern to assure that property C + holds have been proposed in [Wang, 1993].
