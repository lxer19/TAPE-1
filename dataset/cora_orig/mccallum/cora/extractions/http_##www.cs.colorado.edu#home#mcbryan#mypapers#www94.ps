Abstract: A fundamental problem with the World Wide Web is the enormous number of resources available and the difficulty of locating and tracking everything. In this paper we will discuss two tools, GENVL and WWWW, designed to deal in different ways with resource location on the WWW. GENVL is an interactive user-driven hierarchical virtual library system for cataloguing Web resources. The real power of GENVL comes from the built-in recursion which is the key to extendibility and to avoiding the generation of massive linear lists. GENVL has been accessed 112,000 times in 4 months. WWWW - the WWW Worm - is a resource location tool. It is intended to locate almost all of the WWW-addressable resources on the Internet, and provide a powerful search interface to those resources. Searches can be performed on document titles, reference hypertext, or within the components of the URL name strings of documents - for example to locate all mpeg movies in Finland. WWWW has been accessed 60,000 times in 45 days. In the paper we discuss the design of GENVL and WWWW, the tools needed to make them work, and difficulties encountered with using underlying WWW facilities.

Reference-contexts: The vast majority of these accesses have been to read rather than add materials to GENVL. 2.1.1. Related Work There are a large number of manually maintained virtual libraries available on the WWW. Some of these are subject-oriented such as <ref> [1] </ref> while others are service oriented, for example [2]. Many VL are specific to a single subject, for example a list of Computer Science Departments [3]. See [4] for a collection of pointers to virtual libraries. Most of the well-known WWW VL are maintained and updated by one person.

Because information is not inserted directly by information providers these systems do not scale well to an Internet with millions of computers.

Reference-contexts: Because information is not inserted directly by information providers these systems do not scale well to an Internet with millions of computers. Furthermore, most of these systems are not hierarchical, which also severely impacts scalability. One approach to usersupplied information is represented by Martijn Koster's ALIWEB <ref> [5] </ref>, which relies on each WWW server to provide information on resources it maintains. GENVL is oriented towards allowing others to update VL information, and is explicitly highly hierarchical, thereby improving scalability.

Reference-contexts: Some maintenance is still required, for example to correct submission syntax errors and occasionally to relocate a submission to a more appropriate place. GENVL takes inspiration from Eric Ebina's early demonstration, Free for All <ref> [6] </ref>, of Forms capabilities in NCSA Mosaic. 2.2. GENVL Virtual Libraries GENVL represents a general tree of VL's.

Reference-contexts: WWWW has received 61,488 accesses as of April 22, 1994 covering a period of 46 days, for an average of about 1,500 accesses per day. 3.1.1. Related Work There are currently a considerable number of WWW robots and search engines. For pointers to these we refer to M. Kostner <ref> [7] </ref> and to the CUI Search Engines catalogue [8]. Some examples of other robots are represented by [9-11]. New robots are appearing at an astonishing rate. Internet search services has been an active research area for years and we do not attempt to survey all of that work here. <p> M. Koster <ref> [7] </ref> has formulated a useful set of "Guidelines for Robot Writers". 3.3. WWWW Search Engine The WWWW search engine is executed when a user accesses the WWWW home page and fills out a search Form. The engine supports two kinds of search: on HTML and on general URL.
