Abstract: We show that MA EXP , the exponential time version of the Merlin-Arthur class, does not have polynomial size circuits. This significantly improves the previous known result due to Kannan since we furthermore show that our result does not relativize. This is the first separation result in complexity theory that does not relativize. As a corollary to our separation result we also obtain that PEXP, the exponential time version of PP is not in P=poly.

In this paper we give the first reasonable nonrelativizing separation results. Namely, we show that there exist languages in MA EXP , a one-round Merlin-Arthur game [BM88] with an exponential-time verifier, that cannot have polynomial-size circuits.

Reference-contexts: This contrasts greatly with the situation in the unrelativized world: P NP [ P PSPACE EXPSPACE NEEXP = MIP EXP where NEEXP is nondeterministic double exponential time. Our proof that MA EXP does not lie in P=poly uses the result of Babai, Fortnow, Nisan and Wigderson <ref> [BFNW93] </ref> that if EXP has polynomial-size circuits then EXP = MA. Since this is the only part of the proof that does not relativize, our paper gives the first oracle where this Babai-Fortnow-Nisan-Wigderson result does not relativize. <p> Theorem 3.1 (Kannan) NEXP NP 6 P=poly. We improve Kannan's result and show that there are sets in MA EXP that cannot be computed by polynomial-size circuits. We use the following result of Babai, Fortnow, Nisan and Wigder son <ref> [BFNW93] </ref>. Theorem 3.2 (Babai-Fortnow-Nisan-Wigderson) EXP P=poly =) EXP = MA. In order to prove the separation result we will also need the following lemma.

Reference-contexts: We then create an relativized world where every MA EXP language has such circuits. We can strengthen our oracle to create a relativized world where P " P=poly " P = MIP EXP where MIP EXP are languages accepted by multiple prover interactive proof systems <ref> [BGKW88] </ref> with an exponential-time verifier. This contrasts greatly with the situation in the unrelativized world: P NP [ P PSPACE EXPSPACE NEEXP = MIP EXP where NEEXP is nondeterministic double exponential time. <p> This corresponds to the Merlin-Arthur games due to Babai and Moran [BM88]. We also consider multiple-prover interactive proof systems as developed by Ben-Or, Goldwasser, Kilian and Wigderson <ref> [BGKW88] </ref>.
