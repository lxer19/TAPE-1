Abstract: Organizations in the knowledge business realize that their future depends on keeping their employees up to date on the latest technology. Some of us are trying to introduce new technology in our workplaces. Some efforts have been successful and some have not. The patterns described in this paper are the beginning of a pattern language for introducing new technology into the workplace. The contributors to this pattern language came from different organizations located all over the world. What they found when they examined their separate contributions was a close interrelationship between their experiences, which was reflected in the patterns they wrote. Linda Rising and David DeLano led a workshop at OOPSLA `96, Introducing Patterns Into the Workplace. Patterns were written by the following individuals, who represent companies across the globe. This workshop presented an opportunity for sharing our experience as patterns. The original intent of the workshop was to develop a pattern language for introducing patterns into an organization. We found that introducing patterns was but one instance of introducing a new technology.
