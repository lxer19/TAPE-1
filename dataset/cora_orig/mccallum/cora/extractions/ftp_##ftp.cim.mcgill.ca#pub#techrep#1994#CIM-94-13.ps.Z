Reference-contexts: This investigation is part of a project involving motion and force control of a seven-axes manipulator. The manipulator, called REDIESTRO, has been designed at the Robotic Mechanical Systems Laboratory of the McGill Centre for Intelligent Machines, and is equipped with harmonic drives at all seven joints <ref> [1] </ref>. While the natural compliance of the joints is advantageous for force- and torque-control applications, it brings about side effects that must be taken into account for an acceptable performance. Previously published models have been set forth to characterize the nonlinear kinematic and kinetic behavior of harmonic drives. <p> As shown in Section 2.2, the shape of the measured hysteresis characteristics varies with different loading cycles; therefore, the parameters [B f ] j and [fl] j are considered to depend on the maximum load T h of the respective cycle, for j 2 <ref> [1; :::; m] </ref>. Thus, eq. (9) represents n m nonlinear equations for 2 + 2m unknown parameters p T = (c 1 ; c 3 ; [B f ] 1 ; [fl] 1 ; : : : ; [B f ] m ; [fl] m ). <p> For the parameter estimation of the indirect drive RH-25, n = 10 representative data points ( b ; b T h ) have been chosen per measurement with j 2 <ref> [1; :::; 6] </ref>. Figure 7 displays the resulting estimated hysteresis functions, that show good qualitative agreement with the measured data from Fig. 2.

Reference-contexts: Previously published models have been set forth to characterize the nonlinear kinematic and kinetic behavior of harmonic drives. High-resolution quasistatic experiments have been undertaken to study kinematic inaccuracies in the output rotation that are mainly influenced by manufacturing and assembly imperfections, such as tooth-placement errors, out-of-roundness and misalignments. In <ref> [2] </ref> it is shown that the position error displays a primary component twice every wave-generator revolution along with additional smaller components at subsequent harmonics. According to manufacturing data, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the kinematic error rarely exceeds 0.033 degrees of output rotation, which has also been confirmed [2]. <p> In <ref> [2] </ref> it is shown that the position error displays a primary component twice every wave-generator revolution along with additional smaller components at subsequent harmonics. According to manufacturing data, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the kinematic error rarely exceeds 0.033 degrees of output rotation, which has also been confirmed [2]. Transmission compliance, resulting from gear-tooth interaction and wave-generator deformation due to high radial forces, is commonly approximated by a nonlinear or piecewise linear stiffness curve [3, 4].

Recently developed models also include nonlinear dynamic friction composed of a constant and a velocity-dependent part <ref> [5] </ref> or a nonlinear stiffness profile with soft windup and hysteresis that is based on Coulomb-type friction [6]. Extensive experiments focusing on kinematic error and frictional effects have been conducted by Tuttle [7].

Reference-contexts: The sensor information, that is collected at a sampling frequency of 300 Hz, is then available on the host computer for further data processing. Information on sensor callibration as well as the handling of the control software can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. 2.2 Experimental Analysis The first step prior to modelling consists in the analysis of experimental data whose signature eventually defines the structure of the mechanical model. In this investigation, two different types of harmonic drives have been tested, RH-25-1507-BE020AL-SP and RH-32-1212-BE036AL-SP, of Harmonic Drive Systems, Inc. [10].

Since both types revealed the same structural input/output behavior, only results obtained from the RH-25 tests will be discussed here. Results for RH-32 are summarized in Subsection 3.2.2. 5 The first series of experiments addresses the quasistatic deformation of the transmission unit when the output shaft is blocked. <p> 0:2 amp b 1 b 2 c 1 c 3 rad rad 2 4870 rad rad 3 Table 1: Parameters RH-25 Table 1 summarizes the remaining parameters that are required for the simulation model, i.e., motor torque constant, input inertia and gear ratio, whose values are available from technical specifications <ref> [10] </ref>, as well as the estimated values for dynamic friction parameters, the stiffness characteristic, and the no-load starting torque. 3.2.2 Harmonic Drive RH-32 The experimental testing also covered a second joint (RH-32) of the REDIESTRO robot. <p> In this context, it is well worth noting that the measured no-load starting torque B m0 is 50% smaller than the specified catalogue value <ref> [10] </ref>, which emphasizes the variable character of transmission properties even within the same family of harmonic drive gears.
