Reference-contexts: Pure data-based applications which retrieve the products using an exact match with the query are problematic because the customer has to know very well what he wants or he gets no or too many offers <ref> [4] </ref>. Using CBR for the retrieval step is a better solution because the user always gets proposals which can be ordered according to how good they match the query. 1 http://wwwagr.informatik.uni-kl.de/~lsa/CBR/wwwcbrindex.html contains links to many E-Commerce sites using CBR.
