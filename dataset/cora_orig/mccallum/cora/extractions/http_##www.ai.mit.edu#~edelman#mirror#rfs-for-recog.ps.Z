Abstract: We consider the representational capabilities of systems of receptive fields found in early mammalian vision, under the assumption that the successive stages of processing remap the retinal representation space in a manner that makes objectively similar stimuli (such as different views of the same 3D object) closer to each other, and dissimilar stimuli farther apart. We present theoretical analysis and computational experiments that compare the similarity between stimuli as they are represented at the successive levels of the processing hierarchy, from the retina to the nonlinear cortical units. Our results indicate that the representations at the higher levels of the hierarchy are indeed more useful for the classification of natural objects such as human faces.

Reference-contexts: That said, the goal of the anatomical pathway for object recognition becomes less obvious. The photoreceptors are a population of cells, for example, and they are necessarily capable of coding, by their population response, any conceivable stimulus. Why are subsequent populations needed? <ref> (Desimone and Ungerleider, 1989, p.268) </ref>. A number of recent works that do address the computational problem of representation tend to employ information-theoretic terms such as redundancy reduction and efficient coding (Field, 1994; Daugman, 1988; Atick, 1992).

Reference-contexts: In this paper we suggest an alternative approach, based on the observation that object classification (which may be considered an ultimate goal of vision) requires faithful representation of true similarity between shapes <ref> (Edelman, 1993) </ref>. This observation leads to the hypothesis that successive stages of early visual processing remap the retinal space in a manner that makes objectively similar shapes closer to each other. The paper is organized as follows. <p> 4.1 Faithful representation of shape similarity as a goal of sensory coding According to the similarity hypothesis advanced in the present work, an important goal of early visual processing is a remapping of the input into a space where proximal (represented) similarity covaries with the distal (true) similarity between objects <ref> (Edelman, 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Discussion. The results of experiment 3 show that, insofar as the RFs in the visual pathway are adapted to natural scenes, the fractal images in Figure 11 are indeed unnatural. This finding is compatible with the discussion in <ref> (Field, 1994) </ref>, where it is claimed that to look natural, images must exhibit certain properties of phase correlation across spatial scales, in addition to the amplitude correlations implied by their fractal nature. <p> of object classes, are at present open research issues. 4.2 Comparison to other hypotheses regarding sensory coding The similarity hypothesis may be compared with the other recently advanced hypotheses concerning the purpose of early visual transformations, e.g., efficiency of information representation (Atick, 1992), or production of a sparse distributed code <ref> (see Field, 1994, for an extensive review) </ref>. In this connection, we offer two observations. First, it is important to realize that a representation that is optimal under one criterion may be far from optimal under another one. <p> Our second observation is that differences between the optimization criteria employed by various studies of sensory coding do not necessarily mean that their findings lead to a conflict. Note that the similarity hypothesis regarding the goal of sensory coding differs from most of those reviewed, e.g., in <ref> (Field, 1994) </ref> by being based on an assumption as to what may constitute the ultimate goal of vision (namely, object classification), and not just the goals of its intermediate stages.

However, in models of biological vision, the notion of an image is ill-defined at any stage past the projection of the world onto the photoreceptor sheet in retina.
