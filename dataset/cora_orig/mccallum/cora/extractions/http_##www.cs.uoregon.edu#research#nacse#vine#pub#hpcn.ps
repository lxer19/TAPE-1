Reference-contexts: More explanation of experiment construction and execution is necessary to describe this fully and is given in the experiment control section below. 4.1 Experiment Builder Construction of experiments is accomplished using a Java <ref> [1] </ref> applet executed within any Java-enabled web browser. The builder provides a visual environment in which users may choose data, tools, and experiments contained within their notebook to create new experiments.

Reference-contexts: These processes provide the framework for scientific study and are commonly reflected in the physical operations of the traditional laboratory environment. Scientists also follow processes in computational environments that include the use of simulation programs, databases, analysis and visualization tools, networked computing resources, and web-based documentation <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. However, whereas these computational "instruments" are highly advanced, the support for the computational science processes is often simplistic and limited. <p> By using a common Java server to which all clients connect for data movement and workspace creation, collisions of workspaces and intermediate file naming is prevented. 5 Future Directions The current version of ViNE is a prototype being tested by scientists at the University of Oregon <ref> [2] </ref>. During this testing, we have identified a number of enhancements for future versions of the system. The notebook administration component will be extended with a framework for integrating editors appropriate to a variety of data content, allowing users to directly manipulate images, data, and text without leaving ViNE.
