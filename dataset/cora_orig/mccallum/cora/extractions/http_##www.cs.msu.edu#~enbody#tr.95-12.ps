Abstract: Contention has been shown to degrade communication in the recently introduced wormhole-routed computers. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to model and predict the effect of contention on the communication performance for a given application with non-uniform communication. A two-parameter metric is introduced as a measure of quality of a mapping of an application to a multicomputer. We show that performance can be reasonably predicted if we know path contention levels and the new max load traffic, l max , introduced here. Careful mappings that reduce path contention levels and l max are shown to improve performance. Our theoretical results are validated by simulation results. We conclude that minimizing the two parameters developed in the model can be a reasonable mapping objective.

Reference-contexts: Later the increase in communication time due to contention was found to be significant on larger machines, and is was found that contention scaled with system size [3]. Contention can cause a network to become saturated, leading to an exponential increase in communication delay.

Estimate the applied path traffic for the application. This can be done in using any of the methods described in <ref> [2] </ref>. 2. Compute w sat , sat and p a from the tool. If the applied path traffic is greater than sat try another mapping.

Reference-contexts: Efficient communication is essential for good overall performance. In this paper we model communication on the recently introduced wormhole-routed multicomputers. On these computers, contention rather than path length is the limiting factor in achieving efficient communication <ref> [3] </ref>. In [10] we introduced a metric for contention and demonstrated that it was accurate in predicting the performance of homogeneous tasks mapped onto wormhole-routed computers. In this paper, we extend that work to consider the more realistic case of inhomogeneous tasks. <p> At first the mapping problem was thought to be insignificant, and random mapping was found to be good enough [4]. Later the increase in communication time due to contention was found to be significant on larger machines, and is was found that contention scaled with system size <ref> [3] </ref>. Contention can cause a network to become saturated, leading to an exponential increase in communication delay. Path contention level, introduced in [2, 10], characterizes the level of contention.

Reference-contexts: If the switching technique is store-and-forward, reducing dilation is a major criteria. In wormhole-routed multicomputers communication time is insensitive to path lengths. At first the mapping problem was thought to be insignificant, and random mapping was found to be good enough <ref> [4] </ref>. Later the increase in communication time due to contention was found to be significant on larger machines, and is was found that contention scaled with system size [3].

Reference-contexts: In fact, the communication can saturate on this path even before the applied path traffic reaches the saturation path traffic derived above. Characterizing saturation path traffic with non-uniform communication will be useful for applications such as partial differential equations <ref> [5] </ref> and generalized 2D convolution [11]. This non-uniform phenomenon is illustrated in the Figure 5.

Reference-contexts: As we approach the threshold the communication time grows exponentially (Equation 5) and p decreases and eventually falls to zero. 4 Results Let us examine the accuracy of these predictions and present the results of simulations performed with the wormhole network simulator <ref> [7] </ref>. This simulator was validated using data from communication tests on a real wormhole-routed machine|a Symult 2010. Simulations are performed on a 64 and 144 node mesh for messages of length L = 256 bytes, with varying values of path contention level and max load factor l max .

Reference-contexts: Using Klienrock's independence assumption the contention on a path can modeled as an M/M/1 queue with (nk + 1) paths contending for the n th channel, Figure 3. The assumption is <ref> [8] </ref> Assumption: The distribution of service time at each of the queueing systems shown in Figure 2 is a negative exponential and is stochastically independent of the service time of its succeeding nodes. <p> This assumption established a result that this embedded channel offered a solution identical to that of the same channel acting independently from the path with Poisson arrivals at a rate equal to that offered by the path <ref> [8] </ref>. We can then represent Figure 2 as shown in Figure 3.
