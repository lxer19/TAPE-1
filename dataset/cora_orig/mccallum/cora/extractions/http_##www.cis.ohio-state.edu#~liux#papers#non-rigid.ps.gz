Title: Nonrigid Planar Motion from Time-Varying Features  
Abstract: The problem of nonrigid planar shape reconstruction is considered from a temporal series of images with features. An isotopic (i.e., rubber-band like) deformation is constructed from a set of time-varying features including points and lines. Experimental results are presented using real images from botanical growth. keywords: image sequence analysis, nonrigid motion, deformation.

Reference-contexts: In earlier image-based morphing methods, point features organized in a rectilinear fashion [12] are used to define correspondence between two images. Beier and Nealy [2] propose a feature-based method which does not have this constraint. At times, scattered data interpolation methods such as multiquadrics are used for image warping <ref> [1, 10] </ref>. The simplest method for scattered data interpolation would be to use triangulation for a given set of feature points. Using piecewise linear or cubic functions for interpolating triangular patches has been proposed for image registration [4]. Flexible templates are also used for image matching.

Reference-contexts: By the third condition, no point in the image is permitted to jump abruptly from one location to another during the deformation. Intuitively, the shape changes continuously without foldover as in the figure below. The process as descirbed above is at times referred to as rubber-band deformation <ref> [7] </ref>. Such deformation may be used to model various biological process such as heart wall motions and plant growth. The following sequence of images is an example of plant root growth. The root is seen to be bending downwards nonrigidly.
