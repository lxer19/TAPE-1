Abstract: The metachronal wave is a gait used by most terrestrial arthropods. Each leg only lifts when the leg behind it is on the ground in position to support the animals weight. The wave starts from the back as the hind leg lifts and is transferred forward as each leg in turn lifts. At its fastest, it is the tripod gait. In its slowest smooth movement form, only one leg at a time is lifted on each side. This provides increased stability and decreased energy expenditure. Development of stable, smoothly moving metachronal waves for legged robots can provide these same advantages. In this paper we use the Cyclic Genetic Algorithms with an adjustable speed for the robots legs to produce the desired metachronal wave.

Reference-contexts: Learning algorithms based on evolutionary computation have been used to evolve gaits for hexapod robots. Those striving for maximum speed have been used to generate tripod gaits, which are considered optimal for speed while maintaining static stability. Beer and Gallagher <ref> [1] </ref> used genetic algorithms to evolve the weights needed for a neural net controller. Spencer [2] used Genetic Programming to evolve gaits for maximal speed. In previous work [3] we developed Cyclic Genetic Algorithms (CGA), which generate the proper sequence of primitive instructions that when continually repeated produce a gait.

Tests showed that these algorithms quickly converge to produce optimal tripod gaits on a robot simulation. These gaits were successfully transferred to an actual semi-autonomous hexapod robot [4].

Although maximum speed is often desirable, there are situations where it is secondary in importance to stability. Having more legs on the ground at all times is one way to increase stability. Most terrestrial arthropods use what is called the metachronal wave to produce stable forward movement.

Reference-contexts: CGAs are based on Genetic Algorithms, which were introduced by John Holland <ref> [5] </ref>, and use the standard selection, crossover and mutation operators. They differ in that the genes of their chromosome represent a cycle of repeated tasks (Figure 2) that are to be completed in a predetermined segment of time.
