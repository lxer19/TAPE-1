Abstract: We present a statistical model of genes in DNA. A Generalized Hidden Markov Model (GHMM) provides the framework for describing the grammar of a legal parse of a DNA sequence (Stormo & Haussler 1994). Probabilities are assigned to transitions between states in the GHMM and to the generation of each nucleotide base given a particular state. Machine learning techniques are applied to optimize these probabilities using a standardized training set. Given a new candidate sequence, the best parse is deduced from the model using a dynamic programming algorithm to identify the path through the model with maximum probability. The GHMM is flexible and modular, so new sensors and additional states can be inserted easily. In addition, it provides simple solutions for integrating cardinality constraints, reading frame constraints, "indels", and homology searching. The description and results of an implementation of such a gene-finding model, called Genie, is presented. The exon sensor is a codon frequency model conditioned on windowed nucleotide frequency and the preceding codon. Two neural networks are used, as in (Brunak, Engelbrecht, & Knudsen 1991), for splice site prediction. We show that this simple model performs quite well. For a cross-validated standard test set of 304 genes [ftp://www-hgc.lbl.gov/pub/genesets] in human DNA, our gene-finding system identified up to 85% of protein-coding bases correctly with a specificity of 80%. 58% of exons were exactly identified with a specificity of 51%. Genie is shown to perform favorably compared with several other gene-finding systems.

Reference-contexts: In our implementation, the state-specific length distributions were found by generating a length histogram for each state. Figure 5 shows the smoothed and normalized distributions derived from the first training set for introns and internal exons. Splice Site Model Two neural network recognizers were developed as described in <ref> (Brunak, Engelbrecht, & Knudsen 1991) </ref>. We trained a backpropagation feed-forward neural network with one layer of hidden units to recognize donor and acceptor sites, respectively. <p> To achieve that goal, the sequence is coded using 4 input units for each nucleotide and one unit as the output. Empirical experiments similar to <ref> (Brunak, Engelbrecht, & Knudsen 1991) </ref> show that sequence window sizes of 15bp for donor sites (-7..+8) and 41bp for acceptor sites (-21..+20) are optimal. In addition the number of hidden units was experimentally optimized.

Fully or partially overlapping predictions are not accepted. The approximate coefficient (AC) is described by <ref> (Burset & Guigo 1996) </ref> as a preferred alternative over the correlation coefficient and defined by 1 ( TP+FN TP + TN+FP TN ) 1 where TP, FP, TN, and FN are true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

Reference-contexts: Recently, gene-finding systems have been developed that employ many of the known recognition techniques in concert. Current state-of-the-art gene-finding methods combine multiple statistical measures with database homology searching to identify gene features (see, for example, FGENEH (Solovyev, A., & Lawrence 1994), GRAILII (Xu et al. 1994), Gen-Lang <ref> (Dong & Searls 1994) </ref>, GENMARK (Borodovsky & McIninch 1993), and GeneID (Guigo et al. 1992)). The development of gene-finding systems raises research questions regarding the effective and efficient implementation of the system separate from the efficacy of its components. <p> Discussion The predictive ability of our gene-finder is shown to be as good as other gene-finding systems. In particular, in comparisons using the Burset/Guigo data set, Genie's performance is comparable to that of GenLang <ref> (Dong & Searls 1994) </ref>, which was the second best program for predicting exact exons among those tested. This is encouraging, since Genie is based on a rather simple probabilistic framework. However, a short-coming of the current implementation seems to be the proclivity to predict extraneous exons.
