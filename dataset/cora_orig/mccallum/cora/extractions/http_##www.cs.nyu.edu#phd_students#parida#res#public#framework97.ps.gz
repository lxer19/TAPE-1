Title: Uniform Framework for Ordered Restriction Map Problems  
Author: Laxmi Parida 
Note: A  
Abstract: Courant Inst. of Math. Sciences Technical report, TR1997-739, August 1997. (Also submitted for journal publication.) Abstract Optical Mapping [1, 2, 3] is an emerging technology for constructing ordered restriction maps of DNA molecules. The underlying computational problems for this technology have been studied and several cost functions have been proposed in recent literature. Most of these propose combinatorial models; one of them also presents a probabilistic approach. However, it is not a priori clear as to how these cost functions relate to one another and to the underlying problem. We present a uniform framework for the restriction map problems where each of these various models is a specific instance of the basic framework. We achieve this by identifying the following approaches to the ordered restriction map problem: (1) using data consensus or agreement, and, (2) optimizing a characteristic function of the data. Our framework also opens up the possibility of exploring other cost functions. An additional feature is that we not only integrate the combinatorial models but also analyze the probabilistic model within the same framework. Finally, we indicate the open problems by including a survey of the best known complexity results for these problems.

Reference-contexts: A restriction enzyme cleaves or cuts a DNA molecule at some fixed site called the restriction site. An ordered restriction map specifies the location of these identifiable markers or restriction sites along a DNA molecule. A microscope-based technique called Optical Mapping <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref> is a very promising emerging technology for rapid production of ordered restriction maps. We present a uniform framework for the ordered restriction map problems. <p> When the molecule is laid out on a surface, the left-to-right or right-to-left order is lost. However, the orientation information may be given in the data (using a more elaborate chemical protocol) with a vector arm on one fixed side of the molecule <ref> [1] </ref>. The model can view this as a consensus cut site at one end of the map. Notwithstanding this, there is a non-zero probability of the orientation of the molecule being still unknown. 6. Missing Fragments: John can remove some fragments of the string (the substring between two 1's).

This is called the Consistency Graph Problem <ref> [9] </ref>. We make the following observations about this labeled and weighted graph. 1. For any graph G, there always exists a consistent labeling of the graph and an upper bound on the number of flips is the number of edges labeled "1". 2. <p> The Exclusive Binary Flip Cut problem (A-1) was shown to be NP-Complete in [7]; this result was improved in <ref> [9] </ref> to show that the problem is MAX SNP-hard.

Reference-contexts: MAX SNP hardness implies that obtaining an * approximation for a problem, where * &gt; * 0 , for some fixed * 0 (depending on the problem) is NP hard. Thus a MAX SNP hard problem can not admit a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) <ref> [10] </ref>. In [6], it was shown that a dense instance of this problem admits a PTAS.
