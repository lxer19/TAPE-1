Abstract: Coordination is a central theme of Distributed Artificial Intelligence. Much work in this field can be seen as a search for mechanisms that allow agents with differing knowledge and goals to coordinate their actions for mutual benefit. Additionally, one cornerstone assumption of the field is that communication is expensive relative to local computation. Thus, coordination techniques that minimize communication are of particular importance. This paper considers how automated agents could use a coordination technique common to communication-free human interactions, namely focal points. Given a problem and a set of possible solutions from which the agents need to choose one, focal points are prominent solutions of the problem to which agents are drawn. Theoretical work on this subject includes (Schelling 1963; Kraus & Rosenschein 1992). The purpose of the current research is to consider the practical use of focal point techniques in various domains. We present simulations over randomly generated domains; these simulations strongly suggest that focal points can act as an effective heuristic for coordination in real-world environments.

Reference-contexts: For each configuration, 500 runs over random worlds were simulated, giving a calculated accuracy of 5% (with 95% probability <ref> (Devore 1991) </ref> [Section 7]). The final output of 500 runs for each configuration was a number between 0 and 100 that represented the probability of finding an object with a unique focal point value in a random world with the parameters described above.

Reference-contexts: A similar problem has each person asked to choose any positive number, with their only con cern to match the other person's choice. Most people 3 In these situations there are multiple equilibria, and there is a problem in choosing among them.

There are a number of intuitive properties that seem to qualify a given agreement as a focal point. Among these properties are uniqueness, symmetry, and extremeness.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, there have been attempts to get multiple agents to interact effectively with little explicit communication, while allowing the implicit communication of sensing other agents' external actions or condition (e.g., location) <ref> (Levy & Rosenschein 1992) </ref>. Another motivation for studying communication-impoverished interactions, other than the expense of communication, has been that communication is sometimes impossible or inconsistent with the environment (communication has been cut off, or is inadvisable in the presence of hostile forces).
