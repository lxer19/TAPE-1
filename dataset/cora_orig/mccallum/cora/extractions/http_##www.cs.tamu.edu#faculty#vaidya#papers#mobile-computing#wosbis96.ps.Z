Title: Data Broadcast in Asymmetric Wireless Environments

Abstract: With the increasing popularity of portable wireless computers, mechanisms to efficiently transmit information to such clients are of significant interest. The environment under consideration is asymmetric in that the information server has much more bandwidth available, as compared to the clients. In such environments, often it is not possible (or not desirable) for the clients to send explicit requests to the server. It has been proposed that in such systems the server should broadcast the data periodically. One challenge in implementing this solution is to determine the schedule for broadcasting the data, such that the wait encountered by the clients is minimized. A broadcast schedule determines what is broadcast by the server and when. In this paper, we present algorithms for determining broadcast schedules that minimize the wait time. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate that our algorithms perform well. Variations of our algorithms for environments subject to errors, and systems where different clients may listen to different number of broadcast channels are also considered.

Reference-contexts: Approaches for determining what to transmit and when, is the subject of this paper. In the environment under consideration, the downstream communication capacity, from server to clients, is relatively much greater than the upstream communication capacity, from clients to server. Such environments are, hence, called asymmetric communication environments <ref> [2] </ref>. In an asymmetric environment, broadcasting the information is an effective way of making the information available simultaneously to a large number of users. For asymmetric environment, researchers have previously proposed algorithms for designing broadcast schedules [4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 18, 19]. <p> It is important to minimize the access time so as to decrease the idle time at the client. Several researchers have considered the problem of minimizing the access time <ref> [4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 7, 3, 2, 18, 19] </ref> * Tuning time: This is the amount of time a client must listen to the broadcast until it receives the information it needs. <p> Other parameters used in the simulation are described below. 6.1 Demand Probability Distribution We assume that the demand for various items at the client follows Zipf distribution (similar assumptions are made by other researchers as well <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4, 18] </ref>).

This observation also follows from a result presented in [12], and has been implicitly used by others (e.g., <ref> [3, 4, 18] </ref>). Lemma 1 The broadcast schedule with minimum overall mean access time results when the instances of each item are equally spaced. Proof of the lemma is omitted here for brevity. In reality, it is not always possible to space instances of an item equally. <p> The interval (R min ; R max ) is divided into k equal-sized sub-intervals. An item i whose p p i =l i value belongs to the j-th sub-interval is assigned to bucket B j (1 j k). 3.3.1 Comparison of Buckets and Multi-disk <ref> [3] </ref> The notion of a bucket is similar to that of a broadcast disk in the multi-disk approach proposed by Acharya et al. [3].

(b) The algorithm in <ref> [3] </ref> imposes the constraint that the instances of each item be equally spaced at the risk of introducing idle periods (or "holes") in the broadcast schedule (the holes may be filled with other information). <p> Our algorithm also tries to space items at equal spacing, however, it does not enforce the constraint rigidly. Therefore, our algorithm does not create such holes. The argument in favor of a rigid enforcement of equal spacing, as in <ref> [3] </ref>, is that caching algorithms are simplified under such conditions.

The Zipf distribution may be expressed as follows: p i = c 1 where c = 1= P M i=1 (1=i) is a normalizing factor, and is a parameter named access skew coefficient. Different values of the access skew coefficient yield different Zipf distributions. <p> First observation, as noted in the caption of each figure, is that the simulation results are very close to the corresponding analytical results. Now note that, when number of buckets is 1, Algorithm B reduces to the so called "flat" cyclic scheduling <ref> [3] </ref> scheme where each item is broadcast once in a broadcast cycle. As the number of buckets approaches the number of items M , performance of the bucketing algorithm should approach the performance of algorithm A. <p> Secondly, as simulation results are very close to the analytical results, analytical results can be used as a first order approximation of actual performance. A drawback of the related previous work on "multi disks" <ref> [3] </ref> is that they had no analytical method to de-termine an appropriate number of disks. <p> The existing schemes can be roughly divided into two categories (some schemes may belong to both categories, we have listed them in the most appropriate category): Schemes attempting to reduce the access time <ref> [4, 3, 2, 1, 8, 12, 7, 6, 18, 19] </ref> and schemes attempting to reduce the tuning time [10, 9, 11].

Impact of errors on the scheduling policy is also evaluated. In an asymmetric environment, when a client receives an information item containing errors (due to some environmental disturbance), it is not always possible for the client to request retransmission of the information. <p> The first observation stated in Lemma 1 below is intuitive.

In reality, it is not always possible to space instances of an item equally. <p> We assume the ideal situation, as implied by Lemma 1, where instances of all items can be equally spaced. This assumption, although often difficult to implement, does lead to a useful result state in Theorem 1. This result is a generalization of a result derived in <ref> [4, 18] </ref>. The result in [4, 18] applies only to items of identical size, whereas, our result applies to items of differing sizes.

Reference-contexts: Their solution to this problem is to use error control codes (ECC) for forward error correction, and a RAID-like approach (dubbed airRAID) that stripes the data. The server is required to transmit the stripes on different frequencies, much like the RAID approach spreads stripes of data on different disks <ref> [5] </ref>. ECC is not always sufficient to achieve forward error correction, therefore, uncorrectable errors remains an issue (which is ignored in the past work on data broadcast). 8 Summary This paper considers asymmetric environments wherein a server has a much larger communication bandwidth available as compared to the clients.

Several researchers have considered the problem of minimizing the access time <ref> [4, 6, 10, 11, 12, 7, 3, 2, 18, 19] </ref> * Tuning time: This is the amount of time a client must listen to the broadcast until it receives the information it needs. <p> The first observation stated in Lemma 1 below is intuitive. This observation also follows from a result presented in <ref> [12] </ref>, and has been implicitly used by others (e.g., [3, 4, 18]). Lemma 1 The broadcast schedule with minimum overall mean access time results when the instances of each item are equally spaced. Proof of the lemma is omitted here for brevity. <p> The existing schemes can be roughly divided into two categories (some schemes may belong to both categories, we have listed them in the most appropriate category): Schemes attempting to reduce the access time <ref> [4, 3, 2, 1, 8, 12, 7, 6, 18, 19] </ref> and schemes attempting to reduce the tuning time [10, 9, 11]. However, proposed on-line algorithms have not been studied previously. Also, impact of errors on scheduling, and broadcast on multiple channels, have not been addressed. <p> Chiueh [6] and Acharya et al. [3, 2, 1] present schemes that transmit the more frequently used items more often. However, they do not use optimal degree of replication. Our schemes, on the other hand, tend to use optimal frequencies. Jain and Werth <ref> [12] </ref> note that reducing the variance of spacing between consecutive instances of an item reduces the mean access time. The two schemes presented in this paper do attempt to achieve a low variance. Similar to our discussion in Section 4, Jain and Werth [12] also note that errors may occur in <p> Jain and Werth <ref> [12] </ref> note that reducing the variance of spacing between consecutive instances of an item reduces the mean access time. The two schemes presented in this paper do attempt to achieve a low variance. Similar to our discussion in Section 4, Jain and Werth [12] also note that errors may occur in transmission of data. Their solution to this problem is to use error control codes (ECC) for forward error correction, and a RAID-like approach (dubbed airRAID) that stripes the data.

There fore, the above theorem implies that, f i = N p i =l i = j=1 p j l j . <p> Also, as spacing s i = N=f i , a consequence of the above result is that, for overall mean access time to be minimized, we need s i / l i p i As shown in <ref> [15] </ref>, from Theorem 1 it follows that, the optimal overall mean access time, named t optimal , is: t optimal = 1 M X p ! 2 t optimal represents a lower bound on achievable overall mean access time. <p> As F (j) is the largest for j = 1, item 1 is transmitted at time 100. 2 ple 2) It can be shown that, algorithm A always produces a cyclic schedule, if the ties in step 2 of the algorithm are resolved deterministically <ref> [15] </ref>. Performance measurements for the above algorithm are presented in Section 6. Our algorithm improves access time by a factor of 2 as compared to the probabilistic on-line algorithms presented in [17, 18]. In general, the proposed on-line algorithm performs close to the optimal obtained by Equation 3. <p> This suggests that the (p i =l i ) values of all items in any bucket should be close for good results. The Optimal Overall Mean Access Time resulting from the above algorithm, as shown in <ref> [15] </ref>, is given by t opt bucket = 1 0 k X m j q j d j A (6) Similar to t optimal , t opt bucket is a lower bound on performance achievable with bucketing. <p> The client must wait for the next instance of item i. In this section, we evaluate the impact of uncorrectable errors on the scheduling strategy for broadcasts. Suppose that uncorrectable errors occur in an item of length l with probability E (l). 3 <ref> [15] </ref> shows that the overall mean access time, t, for this case, assuming that instances of item i are equally spaced with 2 Even if it were possible for a client to send a retransmit request to the server, it is not clear that a broadcast scheme should allow such requests, <p> Given that the probability of occurrence of uncorrectable errors in an item of length l is E (l), the overall mean access time is minimized when f i / p i 1 E (l i ) and s p i 1 + E (l i ) 1=2 Proof : See <ref> [15] </ref> for proof. 2 The lower bound on overall mean access time now becomes, t opt error = 1 i=1 p i l i 1 + E (l i ) 1=2 (8) For the purpose of demonstration, we now consider a simple error model. <p> The clients can then subscribe to as many channels as they want (and can afford). It is apparent that proper use of these channels should result in better performance. Here we give one approach to exploit these channels to improve performance. Other approaches are also possible <ref> [15] </ref>. The approach considered here uses a modification of Algorithm A, described in Section 3.2, to accommodate multiple channels. Let the total number of broadcast channels be c, the channels being numbered 1 through c. <p> Performance evaluation in presence of such errors is discussed in the next section. Figures 6, 7 and 8 plot overall mean access time for different values of access skew coefficient , for three length distributions presented earlier. (The results for uniform length distribution are similar <ref> [15, 16] </ref>.) In each of these figures, part (a) plots the simulation results and (b) plots the analytical results. In part (a), the curve labeled "Algo A" corresponds to the access time obtained by simulating algorithm A.

This paper presents an approach to minimize the access time. We consider a database that is divided into information items (or items for short). Thus, a broadcast schedule specifies when each item is to be transmitted. <p> The access time achieved by the on-line algorithms is shown to be very close to the theoretical lower bound. Also, performance of our on-line algorithm is significantly better than that proposed previously <ref> [17] </ref>. * On-line algorithms use a decision-making mechanism to determine which information item is to be broadcast next.
