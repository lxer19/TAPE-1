Abstract: Future high-speed networks are expected to carry traffic with a wide range of performance requirements. We describe two queue service disciplines, rate-based scheduling and hierarchical round robin scheduling, that allow some connections to receive guaranteed rate and jitter performance, while others receive best effort service. Rate-based scheduling is designed for fast packet networks, while hierarchical round robin is an extension of round robin scheduling suitable for use in networks based on the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) being defined in CCITT. Both schemes are feasible at rates of one Gigabit/sec. The schemes allow strict bounds on the buffer space required for rate controlled connections and can provide efficient utilization of transmission bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: The second implementation focuses on networks based on Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), where messages are broken up and carried in small, fixed length cells that are switched and multiplexed in a uniform manner <ref> [CCITT] </ref>. This implementation, known as Hierarchical Round Robin Scheduling (HRR), yields the desired performance guarantees by an enhancement of ordinary round robin scheduling. Previous Work In a packet switched network, the main point of control is the queuing discipline used at a switch.

Reference-contexts: The jitter averaging interval would be smaller and would depend on the size of the receive buffer at the destination. Two alternative measures of quality for real-time streams have been suggested in recent work <ref> [FER] </ref>, [LL]. These two alternative measures are the source-to-destination delay bound for a packet and the variance in inter-packet gaps observed at a receiver. In transporting real-time video or voice, bounds on absolute delay for a packet are not sufficient unless the jitter is also controlled.

Reference-contexts: Variations of FCFS and RR policies have been proposed to guarantee quality of service, either by use in conjunction with rate-based admission control [LL],[SLCG] or by including priorities, either static or dynamic, in each packet or implicit with each connection. One notable variation is the Earliest-Due-Date (EDD) scheme <ref> [FV] </ref>, which marks each packet with a due date and schedules the packet Page 3 of 9 Kalmanek, Kanakia and Keshav whose due date is next to expire. Although EDD achieves lowest aggregate delay for a network, the per-packet processing may be prohibitive for high-speed networks. <p> These issues are faced by any packet-switched network. For example, route selection could be done at the source or by control processors in the network based on knowledge of the previously allocated rates <ref> [FV] </ref>. Simulation Experiments Network Topology and Traffic Sources In order to demonstrate the behavior of the rate control schemes, we present simulation results of mixed traffic in a network with HRR nodes. We also present results for FCFS nodes for comparison. The network topology is shown in Figure 5.

Reference-contexts: One approach (Jacobson [JAC] and Ramakrishnan-Jain [RJ]) assumes that sources voluntarily reduce their window size when they sense or are informed of network congestion. These schemes do not provide guarantees against data loss, and depend on the sources willingness to cooperate. In another approach <ref> [HKM] </ref>, the source transmission window is adapted dynamically and the network provides guaranteed buffer space equal to the window size for each connection at each queueing point.

Reference-contexts: These two proposed implementations are equivalent in the sense that they both meet the requirements for a rate-controlled server, and provide a packet transmission order which is similar. Rate-Based Scheduling This algorithm, first proposed by one of the authors <ref> [KAN] </ref>, uses a tree-like structure to store packets awaiting their turn. The structure is shown in We can think of the transmission on the output link as occurring in frames or rounds of fixed size.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Future high-speed networks are expected to carry traffic with a wide range of performance requirements. A classic tradeoff in network design is between providing quality of service guarantees on one hand, and achieving efficient utilization of the transmission bandwidth on the other <ref> [TYM] </ref>. Synchronous circuit switching can provide guaranteed bandwidth and bounds on jitter at the expense of underutilizing bandwidth, whereas datagram networks can optimally utilize bandwidth but cannot provide strong performance guarantees.

Reference-contexts: If the call is accepted, the network provides guaranteed bandwidth and jitter bounds, and there may be mechanisms for renegotiation if the network cannot provide a suitable connection. Best effort connections, on the other hand, do not imply (strong) performance guarantees. As in <ref> [ZHA] </ref>, the rate of a connection is defined over an averaging interval: the rate is determined by dividing the total number of bytes transmitted during an averaging interval by the averaging interval. The value of the averaging interval will determine the allowed burstiness at the source.
