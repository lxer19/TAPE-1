Abstract: This report presents a design for the Remote Communications Manager (RCM). The RCM is designed to be a general distributed communication environment that allows high-performance location-independant communication between heavy-weight Unix processes. The RCM provides a message-based interface to fast shared-memory queues and reliable transport protocols. Designed as an extensible framework, the RCM allows the easy integration of many interprocess communication systems tailored for different mediums and circumstances. Preliminary testing with shared memory queues shows that the RCMs throughput could reach on the order of 40 megabits per second on a Sparc 10. Over a locally developed reliable datagram protocol, performance was measured at approcimately 1.8 megabits per second.
