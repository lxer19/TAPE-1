Title: Low-Power Design of Page-Based Intelligent Memory  
Author: Mark Oskin, Frederic T. Chong, Aamir Farooqui, Timothy Sherwood, and Justin Hensley 
Affiliation: University of California at Davis  
Abstract: We introduce Active Pages, a promising architecture for intelligent memory based upon pages of data and simple functions associated with that data [OCS98]. We evaluate the power consumption of three design alternatives for supporting Active-Page functions in DRAM: reconfigurable logic, a simple processing element, and a hybrid combination of reconfigurable logic and a processing element. Additionally, we discuss operating system techniques to manage power consumption by limiting the number of Active Pages computing simultaneously on a chip.

Reference-contexts: than power consumed by existing DRAM designs, is well below the maximum power ratings predicted by the SIA Technology Roadmap [Sem97] for high-performance package technology. 3.2 Power for Reconfigurable Logic In order to estimate the power consumption of the RADram architecture, we use the power estimation guide provided by Altera <ref> [Alt96] </ref> for the FLEX architecture of devices. We model power for all devices in an operational state. It is assumed that appropriate software control by the Operating System can be used to shutdown portions of the Active Page memory device during reconfiguration.

Reference-contexts: Given these design constraints, hardware inter-page communication facilities can still be constructed, if desired, using asynchronous logic techniques.

Work done at the University of Washington has shown that it is possible to implement real circuits in an asynchronous FPGA <ref> [BEHB] </ref>. Asynchronous FPGAs may prove to be a viable architecture for Active Page memory system processing elements. 6 Conclusion This paper evaluates three different Active Page processing-element architectures, and explores the power requirements of each.

Reference-contexts: If we devote half of the area of such a chip to logic, we expect the DRAM process to support approximately 32M transistors, which is enough to provide 256 LEs to each 512Kbytes sub-array of the remaining 0.5-gigabits of memory on the chip.

Reference-contexts: A global clock may be necessary to provide a baseline reference with which to self-time the locally generated clocks. Given these design constraints, hardware inter-page communication facilities can still be constructed, if desired, using asynchronous logic techniques. Relevant techniques can be found in asynchronous processor cores <ref> [FGT + 97] </ref>, caches, and reconfigurable logic array designs [BEHB] [MA98]. 3.6 Reduced Memory I/O As is pointed out by Stan and Burleson [SB97] typically 10-15% of the power used by desktop systems, and 50% of the power in low power systems comes directly from external I/O. <p> The processing element and hybrid designs have more computational power. Furthermore, we expect to refine both of the latter designs to use less power. Refinements such as clock-gating, and asynchronous processor designs <ref> [FGT + 97] </ref> will help reduce the power consumed by processor, and hybrid processor / reconfigurable logic processor element designs. 4 Software Power Management Active Pages presents new design challenges under low-power constraints. One potential solution is to use software mechanisms which trade off performance for decreased power consumption. <p> The increased clock speed has two disadvantages. First, the larger clock drivers consume more power. Second, overall power dissipation increases linearly with clock frequency. Recent developments have made it possible to use asynchronous logic in more complex logic designs. The AMULET2e processor <ref> [FGT + 97] </ref> is an asynchronous ARM [Fur96] 32-bit processor that consumes 30% of the power and takes 54% of the area of the ARM810 [Fur96]. An asynchronous RISC core provides a low-power means of implementing an Active Page processing element. Another possibility is the use of an asynchronous FPGA.

Reference-contexts: Such an architecture is presented in <ref> [HW97] </ref>. Here we extend this notion by simplifying the processing element core, and shrinking the reconfigurable logic array. The hybrid architecture would consist of a simplified processing element described above in Section 2.2 and a smaller reconfigurable logic array than that presented for RADram in Section 2.1.

Reference-contexts: Using this model we estimate the power consumption of a sub-array size used for gigabit size DRAMs. A DRAM block of m columns and n rows can be represented as shown in Figure 2 <ref> [I + 95] </ref>. This figure shows the current flowing in the DRAM block. There are two major sources of power consumption in DRAMs: 1. Active current, which flows during the read operation. 2. Data retention current, which flows during re-charging the DRAM cells.

Reference-contexts: The processor-mediated approach reduces power by not requiring extensive inter-page communication networks, and global clocking. 2.1 Reconfigurable Logic Our initial implementation of Active Pages focused upon the integration of DRAM and reconfigurable logic. For gigabit DRAMs, a reasonable sub-array size to minimize power and latency is 512Kbytes <ref> [I + 97] </ref>. The RADram (Reconfigurable Architecture DRAM) system, shown in Figure 1, associates 256 LEs (Logic Elements, a standard block of logic in FPGAs which is based upon a 4-element Look Up Table or 4-LUT) to each of these sub-arrays.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we conclude with some future directions for this work. 2 Design Alternatives In this section we briefly present three architectures for Active Page memory systems. These architectures consist of RADram, or reconfigurable logic in DRAM [OCS98], an architecture consisting of only a small RISC or MISC <ref> [Jon98] </ref> like processing element near each page of data, and a hybrid architecture which provides a small processing element with reconfigurable logic processing capability.

Several low-power processing cores currently exist and Active Page designs can leverage the existing and future work in this area. However, a processing engine designed for Active Pages must satisfy two constraints: power and size.

Such a cache is not needed for the limited number of instructions an Active Page memory function contains. The calculations in this paper assume a 1k instruction cache.

Reference-contexts: The operating and packaging characteristics of DRAM chips, however, present new constraints on the power consumption of these systems. We introduce Active Pages, a promising architecture for intelligent memory with substantial performance benefits for data-intensive applications <ref> [OCS98] </ref>. An Active Page consists of a page of data and a set of associated functions that operate on that data. To use Active Pages, computation for an application must be divided, or partitioned, between processor and memory. <p> We also discuss software techniques for reducing power consumption. Finally, we conclude with some future directions for this work. 2 Design Alternatives In this section we briefly present three architectures for Active Page memory systems. These architectures consist of RADram, or reconfigurable logic in DRAM <ref> [OCS98] </ref>, an architecture consisting of only a small RISC or MISC [Jon98] like processing element near each page of data, and a hybrid architecture which provides a small processing element with reconfigurable logic processing capability. <p> However in an Active Page system, memory intensive sections of an application are executed inside the memory chip thereby reducing the total number of external bus transactions. applications executing on the RADram Active Page memory system. Each application is described in <ref> [OCS98] </ref>, but here we note that a significant reduction in the total number of memory bus accesses can be achieved by the use of Active Pages. <p> The same algorithms can also be employed to consider power consumption. Power thus becomes another variable in the minimization goal, and can be balanced by the programmer at compilation time against performance. 5 Future Work Our previous work <ref> [OCS98] </ref> has shown that Active Pages are a promising architecture for intelligent memory with substantial performance benefits. Our current work focuses upon the power consumption of Active Page implementations. Estimates show that several design alternatives exist, but Active Page DRAMs will benefit from advances in low-cost packaging technologies.

Reference-contexts: This allows efficient support for Active-Page sizes which are multiples of 512Kbytes. Each LE requires approximately 1k transistors of area on a logic chip. The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) roadmap <ref> [Sem97] </ref> projects mass production of 1-gigabit DRAM chips by the year 2001. <p> Using this calculation we can deduce that a storage-only gi-gabit size DRAM chip will consume 13:4mW 256 = 3:4W of power. The 1 gigabit DRAM power consumption, while greater than power consumed by existing DRAM designs, is well below the maximum power ratings predicted by the SIA Technology Roadmap <ref> [Sem97] </ref> for high-performance package technology. 3.2 Power for Reconfigurable Logic In order to estimate the power consumption of the RADram architecture, we use the power estimation guide provided by Altera [Alt96] for the FLEX architecture of devices. We model power for all devices in an operational state. <p> Due to the many projections required to estimate our power consumption in future technologies, we suspect up to a 30-50% error in our power models. However, these rough calculations suggest that Active Pages will be in line with the power budgets of the commodity packaging technologies of the future <ref> [Sem97] </ref>. Furthermore, software mechanisms show strong potential for reducing peak and overall power consumption.
