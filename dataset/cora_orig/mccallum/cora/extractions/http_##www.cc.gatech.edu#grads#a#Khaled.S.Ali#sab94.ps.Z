Abstract: Multi-agent schema-based reactive robotic systems are complemented with the addition of a new behavior controlled by a teleoperator. This enables the whole society to be affected as a group rather than forcing the operator to control each agent individually. The operator is viewed by the reactive control system as another behavior exerting his/her influence on the society as a whole. Simulation results are presented for foraging, grazing, and herding tasks. Teleau-tonomous operation of multi-agent reactive systems was demonstrated to be significantly useful for some tasks, less so for others.

Reference-contexts: In this research, the teleoperator is allowed to control whole societies of agents; not one robot at a time, but rather controlling global behavior for the entire multi-agent system. This is a straightforward extension of our work in both multi-agent robotic systems <ref> [1] </ref> and teleau-tonomy [2]. The end product is a simple way for a commander to control large numbers of constituent elements without concern for low-level details (which each of the agents is capable of handling by themselves).

Reference-contexts: Using a schema-based methodology <ref> [3] </ref>, each active behavior contributes a vector that is related to the agent's intentions such as to get to a particular object, not crash into something, etc. <p> For example, the robot can become more aggressive by increasing its attraction towards a desirable object or decreasing its re pulsion from obstacles. In schema-based reactive control <ref> [3] </ref>, each active behavior (schema) provides its own reaction to the environment by creating a vector response to a specific perceptual stimulus. The entire set of vector outputs created by all active schemas is summed and normalized and then transmitted to the robot for execution. <p> A small amount of noise is still injected into the system to facilitate navigation <ref> [3] </ref>. * Deliver which occurs after acquisition of the attractor and results in delivery of the object back to home base by one or more agents. The same behaviors are used as in the acquire state with the goal location now being the home base.

Reference-contexts: gain and long persistence noise schema that is used to produce wandering while having moderate inter-robot repulsion to produce dispersion coupled with significant obstacle repulsion (avoid-static-obstacle schemas). * Acquire which consists of using a move-to-goal schema to move towards a detected or reported attractor (depending on the communication strategy used <ref> [4] </ref>) with a reduced inter-robot repulsion to allow for multi-robot convergence on attractors and continued obstacle avoidance (again provided by the avoid-static-obstacle schema). <p> The agents have a limited form of communication between themselves. A robot is capable of communicating its current behavioral state or the location of an attractor that it is acquiring or delivering <ref> [4] </ref>. The communication is simulated by using shared memory. Each agent only looks at this shared memory when there is no attractor within its sensing range.
