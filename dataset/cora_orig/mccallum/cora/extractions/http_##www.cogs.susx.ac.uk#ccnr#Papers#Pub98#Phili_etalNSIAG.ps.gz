Abstract: This paper presents a computational model of Nitric Oxide (NO) diffusion in nervous systems. The discovery that this freely diffusing molecule acts as a neurotransmitter has recently had a major impact on our thinking about fundamental neural mechanisms. For the first time, we have modelled diffusion from biologically realistic structures and results from our investigation into spatial and temporal aspects of NO spread are described. It is explained how this study links to more abstract modelling of the modulatory affects of NO in neuronal networks that may have important consequences for both neuroscience and engineering.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The discovery that the gas Nitric Oxide (NO) is a neuronal signalling molecule has radically altered our thinking about how information is transmitted in the brain <ref> [1] </ref>. Traditionally neurotransmission is thought to be spatially and temporally restricted and from the pre-synaptic to the post-synaptic neuron. However the release of NO does not require specialized point-to-point synaptic contacts and unlike traditional neurotransmitters, NO can diffuse through cell membranes.

Reference-contexts: However the release of NO does not require specialized point-to-point synaptic contacts and unlike traditional neurotransmitters, NO can diffuse through cell membranes. NO may therefore act without the need for conventional synaptic connectivity and its action is not necessarily locally confined to the immediate post-synaptic neuron <ref> [2] </ref>. In the brain NO is generated by the calcium-activated enzyme NO synthase, or NOS [3]. Once synthesized, NO diffuses in three dimensions away from the site of synthesis regardless of intervening cellular or membrane structures.

Reference-contexts: The values of the other constants that were used are as follows: D = 3300m 2 =sec [8] and ae = 2:38 fi 10 21 m 3 <ref> [4] </ref>. 3 Results and Discussion The evolution of the concentration solutions for point-source and sphere was examined for a burst of synthesis of duration 0.5 seconds, with results shown in figure 1. As can be seen, they are qualitatively different in both the synthesis and post-synthesis stages. <p> For the point-source, the concentration rises rapidly but soon seems to approach an equilibrium the steady-state solution (fig.1a). As a consequence of this, much of the work in modelling of NO has focussed on the steady-state solution, <ref> [4] </ref>, [5]. However, such an approximation would not be valid for the sphere, as from fig.1c, we see that steady-state is not approached. Once the period of synthesis is over, the point-source peak concentration dies away very rapidly, dropping to 20% of the maximum attained in 0.25 secs (fig.1b).

Reference-contexts: A model of NO spread therefore could potentially provide a theoretical framework for evaluating the signalling capacity of NO in the brain. Although models of NO diffusion have been published ([4], <ref> [5] </ref>) almost all of this work has concentrated on mod-elling the instantaneous activation of NO synthesis and the spread of NO from point sources which have no physical dimension. Although this may give some 1 insight, serious mathematical anomalies and biologically implausible results are introduced by this approach. <p> For the point-source, the concentration rises rapidly but soon seems to approach an equilibrium the steady-state solution (fig.1a).

Reference-contexts: full presentation of these results and so only a subset have been presented here, with a complete account to follow. 2 Method The dynamics of diffusion are governed by the modified diffusion equation: @C Dr 2 C = C (1) where C is concentration and D is the diffusion coefficient <ref> [6] </ref>. The term on the right hand side is an inactivation function, used to model the loss of NO through various chemical reactions. This has been taken to be exponential decay since there is no real data to suggest any other function. <p> If this is not the case, other techniques (e.g. difference equations) must be used. 2.2 Solutions for continuous sources The solution for a source which emits NO continuously is derived from the solution for an instantaneous source in the natural way, again via the principle of superposition <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This has been taken to be exponential decay since there is no real data to suggest any other function. Thus: 1=2life = ln (2=). 2.1 Instantaneous symmetrical sources Some solutions to (1) taken from the field of thermodynamics <ref> [7] </ref> are readily applicable to modelling diffusion. The main technique used in this field is to build up solutions for complicated structures from summation of contributions from point source solutions. <p> This is intended to approximate the proportions of a large spherical cell, whose cytoplasm synthesises NO and whose nucleus does not. The instantaneous solution is <ref> [7] </ref>: C sphere (r; t 0 ) = aeS (t) p Z 100 r 0 e t (e 4Dt e 4Dt )dr 0 (7) where ae is the density of the sources and S (t) the source strength.
