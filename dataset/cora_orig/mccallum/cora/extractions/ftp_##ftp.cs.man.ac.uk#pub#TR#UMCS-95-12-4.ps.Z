Reference-contexts: Any group action on a set induces a permutation group of the set. Note also the empty function itself forms a (one-element) permutation group on the empty set. 2 Thus we use a choice function. Different choice functions only result in isomorphic process structures <ref> [1] </ref>. An alternative formulation which does not rely on choice functions is given in [2]. 1 It is easy to observe (cf. [1]) that S forms a permutation group over H (hp; ffi; qi). Thus P fi Q is a process structure so that (1) is well-defined. <p> Different choice functions only result in isomorphic process structures <ref> [1] </ref>. An alternative formulation which does not rely on choice functions is given in [2]. 1 It is easy to observe (cf. [1]) that S forms a permutation group over H (hp; ffi; qi). Thus P fi Q is a process structure so that (1) is well-defined. Moreover we can prove (for example as a simple corollary of Proposition 3.11 of [1]) that an n-ary product enjoys such an isomorphism law as (P <p> is given in [2]. 1 It is easy to observe (cf. <ref> [1] </ref>) that S forms a permutation group over H (hp; ffi; qi). Thus P fi Q is a process structure so that (1) is well-defined. Moreover we can prove (for example as a simple corollary of Proposition 3.11 of [1]) that an n-ary product enjoys such an isomorphism law as (P fi Q) fi R ' P fi (Q fi R)(3) as well as other familiar ones. <p> Since process isomorphism coincides with isomorphism in the category, and products constructed from a binary product are readily shown to be categorical products, this proves the theorem. We start from recollection of some notions given in <ref> [1] </ref>. 2.1 Definition. (i) A p-map &lt; from P to Q is a set of correspondences satisfying the following condi tions: (A). 8p 2 P: 9ffi; q 2 Q: hp; ffi; qi 2 &lt; (totality) (B). hp; ffi; qi 2 &lt; ) (hp; ffi 0 ; q 0 i 2 &lt; <p> &lt; ffi ID P = ID Q ffi &lt; = &lt; (iii) A p-map &lt; : P ! Q is an isomorphism if and only if the following holds: &lt; ffi &lt; 1 = ID P and &lt; 1 ffi &lt; = ID Q Proof: (i) and (ii) are from <ref> [1] </ref>. For "if" direction of (iii), we should show &lt; 1 is a p-map. Clearly it is everywhere defined and unique for processes, and every correspondence in it is surjective. Moreover since &lt; is closed under &lt; 1 is also closed under . <p> Thus the collection of all process structures and p-maps form a category. We call the category PS. The identity of an object P in PS is ID P , and isomorphisms in PS are precisely isomorphisms as p-maps. The following is a corollary of Proposition 3.11 of <ref> [1] </ref>. 2.4 Proposition. P fi Q, defined as in (1.2) and regarded as a process structure as in (1.3) is a categorical product of P and Q in PS.
