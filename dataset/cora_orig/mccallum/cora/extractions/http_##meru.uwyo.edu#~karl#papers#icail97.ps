Abstract: The capacity for self-explanation can make computer-drafted documents more credible, assist in the retrieval and adaptation of archival documents, and permit comparison of documents at a deep level. We propose a knowledge-based model of documents that makes explicit the underlying goals that documents are intended to achieve and the stylistic conventions to which they must conform. These goals and conventions are expressed in a dual justification structure that represents the illocutionary and rhetorical dependencies underlying documents. After demonstrating how a document grammar derived from dual justification structures can be used to automate document drafting, we show how documents can exploit dual justification structures to "explain themselves" by answering queries about (1) the purposes for inclusion of text in the document and (2) the justification for propositions expressed in the text. This self-explanation framework has been implemented in the Docu-Planner, a prototype document generation system that produces "queryable" documents.

Reference-contexts: The formalization of inter-sentential discourse relations is a key requirement for the development of self-explaining documents. The most directly relevant portion of research in discourse structure is speech act theory. Initiated by J.L. Austin, who was primarily concerned with explicit performatives <ref> [Aus62] </ref>, speech act theory addresses the illocutionary content of discourse, i.e., the goals that a speaker intends to accomplish through that discourse [Gri75, Sea69]. The theory of argumentation addresses texts intended to persuade, establish, or prove.

Reference-contexts: The theory of argumentation addresses texts intended to persuade, establish, or prove. For example, Toulmin [Tou58] analyzed argumentative texts in terms of the concepts of warrant, ground, conclusion, backing, and qualification. This model has been widely applied to the analysis [Mar89, ZS95] and creation <ref> [BCS95] </ref> of legal documents. Argument structure, like other forms of illocutionary goal structure but unlike rhetorical structure, does not directly address the "surface" form of texts.

Reference-contexts: Argument structure, like other forms of illocutionary goal structure but unlike rhetorical structure, does not directly address the "surface" form of texts. This line of research is particularly relevant to the analysis of the illocutionary structure of persuasive or dispositive documents, such as legal briefs and judicial decisions <ref> [Bra93] </ref>. Automated document drafting research is the fourth relevant research area. Two important areas of automated document drafting research are automated legal drafting and automated report generation.

Similarly, it backchains on the rhetorical operators to construct the document's rhetorical structure.

Given a representation of a particular domain for a particular application, knowledge-based report generation is the task of automatically producing clearly stated reports that are relevant to users of the application.
