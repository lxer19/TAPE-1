Reference-contexts: Researchers are not granted any roles that would allow them to see patient-identifying information. They retrieve data based on anonymous patient or tumor identifiers. 5.2 Access to NOIS The NOIS is implemented using a client-server architecture. In this model, the database <ref> [4, 5] </ref> plays the role of the server and all users are viewed as its clients. Clients input and query data in the NOIS database using forms accessible through their local World Wide Web browser.[6, 7] The NOIS home page is located at URL http://acuity.cis.ohio-state.edu.
