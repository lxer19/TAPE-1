Reference-contexts: However, Wismath [Wis89] proved that all planar graphs have a rectangle-visibility representation. Also, Dean and Hutchinson [DH94] proved that a complete bipartite graph K p;q has rectangle-visibility representation if and only if p 4. Another extension of bar-visibility graphs that was studied by Bose et al. <ref> [BEF + 94] </ref> is the class of VR-representable graphs. In this representation each vertex of the graph maps to a closed rectangle in E 3 and edges are expressed by vertical visibility between rectangles.

Reference-contexts: of the class of directed rectangle-visibility graphs is unbounded. 1 Rectangle-Visibility Graphs The problem of determining a visibility representation of a graph, where the vertices of the graph map to sets in Euclidean space and the edges are expressed as visibility relations between these sets, has been widely studied (see <ref> [BETT93] </ref> for a survey). One representation in the plane that has been studied [Wis89, DH94] maps each vertex of the graph to a closed isothetic rectangle in E 2 and each edge to a horizontal or vertical band of sight between two rectangles.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that the directed K n;n M , where all edges are directed from one partition to the other, has dimension n. Since a directed acyclic graph can be used to represent a partial order, work done by Rival and Urrutia <ref> [RU88, RU92] </ref> on representing partially ordered sets by moving convex objects in space is related to our study of the dimension of rectangle-visibility graphs. 3 Unbounded Dimension of Rectangle-Visibility Graphs We now show that the dimension of the class of directed rectangle-visibility graphs is unbounded.

Reference-contexts: Rectangle-visibility graphs are an extension of bar-visibility graphs, which were defined independently by Wismath [Wis85] and Tamassia and Tollis <ref> [TT86] </ref>. In this representation vertices map to closed, disjoint, horizontal line segments in the plane, and two vertices are adjacent in the graph if and only if their corresponding segments are *-visible in the vertical direction. <p> The class of all bar-visibility graphs was completely characterized by both Wismath [Wis85] and Tamassia and Tollis <ref> [TT86] </ref>. They independently proved that a graph has a bar-visibility representation if and only if it has a planar embedding such that all cut vertices lie on the external face. The class of all rectangle-visibility graphs has not been completely characterized.
