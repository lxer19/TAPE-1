Title: AUTHENTICATION SCHEME FOR DISTRIBUTED, UBIQUITOUS, REAL-TIME PROTOCOLS 1,2  
Author: David L. Mills 
Address: 19716  
Affiliation: University of Delaware Newark, DE  
Abstract: Cryptographic authentication methodology proposed for use in the Internet require substantial resources when very large client populations are involved. Resource provisioning becomes especially important when time-critical services are involved. In the cast of time synchronization services, a special case exists, since cryptographic keys must enforce valid lifetimes, but validating key lifetimes requires cryptographic keys. This paper proposes a scheme which minimizes server resources while resolving the apparent circularity.

Reference-contexts: In multicast mode, servers send messages at a controlled rate and respond only to key-request messages. A server first calculates a list of 16-octet session keys for later use, as in the S/KEY system <ref> [2] </ref>. It first computes the session key as in clientserver mode and uses this as the first entry in the list. For this purpose, the IP source and destination addresses are the server address and assigned multicast group address, respectively, and the key identifier is a random roll.
