Abstract: We examine whether Ladner's results hold if we restrict ourselves to "uniformly hard languages" which have no long sequences of easily computable instances. Under a hard to disprove assumption, we show that there exists a minimal recursive uniformly hard set under honest many-one polynomial-time reductions.

Reference-contexts: a strange quirk in Ladner's proof that causes a hard set with long stretches of easiness is a quirk that cannot be eliminated. 1.1 An Historical Perspective The realization that virtually all combinatorial reductions arising from concrete problems were honest (such as those of Karp [13] and Garey and Johnson <ref> [10] </ref>) came very early, and strong forms of this observation gave rise to conjectures such as the Isomorphism Conjecture of Berman and Hartmanis [7].

Reference-contexts: From the point of view that SAT is like this, it is very natural to study such languages. Our final motivation is to try to relate complexity-theoretical hypotheses to structural ones for the appropriate reducibilities. Homer <ref> [12] </ref> has one example for the noncomputable languages under honest polynomial time reductions, but his techniques do not apply to the computable languages. In our setting we get a nice consequence of the hypothesis that P = P SP ACE.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction If P 6= NP then we know that the NP-complete sets and the sets in P are disjoint. Must NP have any other sets? Ladner <ref> [14] </ref> gives a positive answer by showing that if P 6= NP then there exist NP sets not in P and not NP-complete. In fact, Ladner actually proves a much more general result.

The fundamental paper here is Ladner <ref> [14] </ref>, who demonstrated considerable richness in the structures, showing that, for instance for honest and standard polynomial time m; tt; and T reducibilities, there were minimal pairs and that the structure was dense.
