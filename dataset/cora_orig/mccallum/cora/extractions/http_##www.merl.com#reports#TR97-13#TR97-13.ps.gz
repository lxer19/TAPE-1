Reference-contexts: Sample labelings of this sort are depicted in Figure 1. This NP-hard problem has been attacked by a number of researchers. Thorough empirical testing has shown that a heuristic algorithm based on simulated annealing (SA) outperforms all previously published practical algorithms for this problem <ref> [1] </ref>. Recently, Wagner and Wolff [3] have explored a variant of the PFLP problem. <p> Wagner and Wolff claim that their admissibility test performs well in solving 4-VPFLP problems. We tested the WW algorithm for 4-VPFLP in comparison with binary search using other admissibility tests, in particular: the SA variant mentioned above, a random-descent method (DE) also proposed by Christensen et al. <ref> [1] </ref>, and a baseline random-placement method (RND). Figure 2 shows the result of these tests on a set of problems at a wide range of densities generated randomly according to the methods of Christensen et al. [1]. <p> SA variant mentioned above, a random-descent method (DE) also proposed by Christensen et al. <ref> [1] </ref>, and a baseline random-placement method (RND). Figure 2 shows the result of these tests on a set of problems at a wide range of densities generated randomly according to the methods of Christensen et al. [1]. Label density, varying along the x axis, is given by the number of labels of size 30 fi 7 on a map of dimensions 792 fi 612, ranging from 100 to 1000 in multiples of 100. <p> Of course, if the preprocess reports that no perfect labeling exists (as it well might), we need to decide what to do. Figure 4 shows the result of a test of algorithms using the preprocess to augment SA. (The methodology is identical to that used by Christensen et al. <ref> [1] </ref> so that the results are directly comparable.) The line marked "WW+SA halt on fail detect" stops eliminating candidate positions as soon as the preprocess concludes that no perfect labeling exists. The line marked "WW+SA, thorough" continues to eliminate candidate positions thereafter.

Reference-contexts: We find that SA performs essentially identically to WW, though it is slower. However, the generality of the SA algorithm (explored, for instance, by Edmondson et al. <ref> [2] </ref>) means that, unlike WW, SA can be applied to a far broader range of VPFLP variants.
