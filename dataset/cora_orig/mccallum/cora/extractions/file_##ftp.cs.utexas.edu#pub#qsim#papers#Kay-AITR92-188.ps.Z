Title: A Qualitative Model of the Space Shuttle Reaction Control System  
Author: Herbert Kay 
Date: April 8, 1994  
Abstract: The Space Shuttle Reaction Control System (RCS) is a component of the space shuttle propulsion system that provides motion control for the shuttle orbiter. As part of a model-based monitoring and diagnosis system for the RCS, a qualitative model of the system was developed using the QSIM modeling language. This report describes the RCS model, the assumptions that went into it, and predictions that can be made with the model. fl This work has taken place at the Artificial Intelligence Research Branch of the NASA Ames Research Center and the Qualitative Reasoning Group at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin. Research of the Qualitative Reasoning Group is supported in part by NSF grants IRI-8905494 and IRI-8904454, by NASA grant NAG 2-507, by the Texas Advanced Research Program under grant no. 003658175, and by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Reference-contexts: Originally, the abstract regulator was modeled using a second order mechanical model of a regulator a la deKleer and Brown <ref> [de Kleer and Brown, 1984] </ref>. This model, while tractable by itself, caused the total RCS model to become intractable. It was then replaced by a first-order mechanical model, but this proved intractable as well. In the final model, the regulator is modeled functionally by a set of operating modes.

Reference-contexts: To introduce faults (as well as to model the regulator), the moded-constraint and discrete variables QSIM constructs were used. This permits multiple QDEs that differ in only a few constraints to be modeled as a single QDE with "switchable" constraints that depend on mode variables <ref> [Farquhar et al., 1991] </ref>. The remainder of this section details sections of the RCS model. Refer to Appendix A for the full model. Helium Tank The Helium Tank is modeled as a simple gas container with a fixed volume 5 and a single outlet.

Reference-contexts: Another approach is to use behavior aggregation techniques to abstract irrelevant distinctions in the behaviors <ref> [Fouche and Kuipers, 1991] </ref>. There are also other similar systems in the space shuttle that are candidates for this type of modeling. In particular, the Orbital Maneuvering System is designed in much the same way as the RCS.

Reference-contexts: Because the RCS model is large, it is difficult to add new components by direct modification of the QDE. However, since the components of the model and their connections are well-understood, a logical next step would be to reimplement the model using a component-connection ontology like CC <ref> [Franke and Dvorak, 1990] </ref>. * Generic tractability improvements. One way to improve tractability is to include quantitative information about the RCS and then use semiquantitative methods [Kuipers and Berleant, 1988, Kay and Kuipers, 1992] to refute impossible behaviors and tighten the predictions of the remaining ones.
