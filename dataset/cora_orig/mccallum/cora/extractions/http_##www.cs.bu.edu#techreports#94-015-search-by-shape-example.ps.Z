Abstract: We describe our work on shape-based image database search using the technique of modal matching. Modal matching employs a deformable shape decomposition that allows users to select example objects and have the computer efficiently sort the set of objects based on the similarity of their shape. Shapes are compared in terms of the types of non-rigid deformations (differences) that relate them. The modal decomposition provides deformation control knobs for flexible matching and thus allows for selecting weighted subsets of shape parameters that are deemed significant for a particular category or context. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for shape comparison in 2-D image databases; however, the general formulation is applicable to signals of any dimensionality.

Reference-contexts: In the last few years researchers have made some progress toward automatic shape indexing for image databases. The general approach has been to calculate some approximately invariant statistic like shape moments, and use these to stratify the image database <ref> [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 9] </ref>. The problem with this general approach is that it discards significant perceptual and semantic information.

Reference-contexts: Rather than discarding useful similarity information by employing only invariants, we believe that one should use a decomposition that preserves as much semantically meaningful and perceptually important information as is possible, while still providing an efficient encoding of the original signal <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: most of our object comparisons, since it has a convenient physical meaning; however, we suspect that (in general) it will be necessary to weigh higher-frequency modes less heavily, since these modes are more susceptible to noise. 4.3 Modal shape categories Using methods similar to those employed by Ullman and Basri <ref> [13] </ref> we can describe objects as linear combinations of some collection of base models.
