Abstract: To learn the current status of any Internet-Draft, please check the 1id-abstracts.txt listing contained in the Internet-Drafts Shadow Directories on ftp.is.co.za (Africa), nic.nordu.net (Europe), munnari.oz.au (Pacific Rim), ds.internic.net (US East Coast), or ftp.isi.edu (US West Coast). Abstract Many styles of multimedia conferencing are likely to co-exist on the Internet, and many of them share the need to invite users to participate. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a simple protocol designed to enable the invitation of users to participate in such multimedia sessions. It is not tied to any specific conference control scheme, providing support for either loosely or tightly controlled sessions. In particular, it aims to enable user mobility by relaying and redirecting invitations to a user's current location. This document is the result of a merger of the Session Invitation Protocol (draft-ietf-mmusic-sip-00.txt) and the Simple Conference Invitation Protocol (draft-ietf-mmusic-scip-00.txt), and of an attempt to make SIP more generic and to fit into a more flexible infrastructure that includes companion protocols including SDP, HTTP and RTSP.

Reference-contexts: The Session Description Protocol (SDP) <ref> [1] </ref> together with the Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) [2] provide a mechanism for the former. This document presents the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to perform the latter. SIP may use SDP or another session description format to describe a session.

Reference-contexts: SIP offers some of the same functionality as H.323, but may be used in conjunction with it. In this mode, H.323 is used to locate the appropriate terminal identified by H.245 address [TBD: what does this look like?]. An H.323-capable terminal then proceeds with a normal H.323/H.245 invitation <ref> [3] </ref>. 1.1 Terminology In this document, the key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL are to be interpreted as described in RFC xxxx [6] and indicate requirement levels for compliant SIP implementations. 1.2 Definitions This specification uses a number of terms to

Reference-contexts: The definitions of client, server and proxy are similar to those used by the Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) <ref> [4] </ref>. Client: An application program that establishes connections for the purpose of sending requests. Clients may or may not interact directly with a human user. Initiator: The party initiating a conference invitation. Note that the calling party does not have to be the same as the one creating a conference. <p> Handley/Schulzrinne/Schooler Expires December 25, 1997 [Page 7] INTERNET-DRAFT draft-ietf-mmusic-sip-03.ps June 20, 1997 3 SIP Message Overview Since much of the message syntax is identical to HTTP/1.1, rather than repeating it here we use [HX.Y] to refer to Section X.Y of the current HTTP/1.1 specification <ref> [4] </ref>. In addition, we describe SIP in both prose and an augmented Backus-Naur form (BNF) [H2.1] described in detail in [8]. All SIP messages are text-based and use HTTP/1.1 conventions [H4.1], except for the additional ability of SIP to use UDP.

Reference-contexts: From a pragmatic point of view, TCP allows easier passage through existing firewalls, and with appropriate protocol design, allows common servers for SIP, HTTP and the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) <ref> [5] </ref>. When TCP is used, SIP can use one or more connections to attempt to contact a user or to modify parameters of an existing session.

Reference-contexts: An H.323-capable terminal then proceeds with a normal H.323/H.245 invitation [3]. 1.1 Terminology In this document, the key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL are to be interpreted as described in RFC xxxx <ref> [6] </ref> and indicate requirement levels for compliant SIP implementations. 1.2 Definitions This specification uses a number of terms to refer to the roles played by participants in SIP communications. The definitions of client, server and proxy are similar to those used by the Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) [4].
Reference: [7] <author> A. Gulbrandsen and P. Vixie, </author> <title> A DNS RR for specifying the location of services (DNS SRV), RFC 2052, </title> <institution> Internet Engineering Task Force, </institution> <month> Oct. </month> <year> 1996. </year> <note> Handley/Schulzrinne/Schooler Expires December 25, 1997 [Page 42] INTERNET-DRAFT draft-ietf-mmusic-sip-03.ps June 20, </note> <year> 1997 </year>
Reference-contexts: If not, the requesting client SHOULD attempt to find the address for a remote user agent proxy, by looking up the domain part of the user address in the DNS. This provides one or more records giving IP addresses. If a new service (SRV) resource record <ref> [7] </ref> is returned giving a location server, then that is the address to contact next. If no relevant SRV record is returned, but an A record is returned, then that is the address to use.

Reference-contexts: In addition, we describe SIP in both prose and an augmented Backus-Naur form (BNF) [H2.1] described in detail in <ref> [8] </ref>. All SIP messages are text-based and use HTTP/1.1 conventions [H4.1], except for the additional ability of SIP to use UDP. When sent over TCP or UDP, multiple requests can be carried in a single TCP connection or UDP datagram. <p> This is meant for indicating general communication capability, not the support for specific encodings. It should be sufficient to allow the caller to choose an appropriate communication address. Appendix A: Summary of Augmented BNF In this specification we use the Augmented Backus-Naur Form notation described in <ref> [8] </ref>.
