Title: OVERCOMING INSTABILITY IN COMPUTING THE FUNDAMENTAL MATRIX FOR A MARKOV CHAIN  
Author: DANIEL P. HEYMAN AND DIANNE P. O'LEARY 
Keyword: Key words. Markov chains, fundamental matrix, decision process.  
Abstract: April 5, 1996 Abstract. We present an algorithm for solving linear systems involving the probability or rate matrix for a Markov chain. It is based on a UL factorization but works only with a submatrix of the factor U. We demonstrate its utility on Erlang-B models as well as more complicated models of a telephone multiplexing system.

Reference-contexts: This model is described in continuous time, but it can be converted into a discrete-time model where transitions occur at times 1; 2; : : : by "uniformizing" the model; see, e.g., Heyman and Sobel <ref> [3, x8-7] </ref> for details. Let P be the transition matrix of the discrete-time Markov chain; P inherits the state space f0; 1; 2; : : :; ng and has elements p ij . If some r j = 1, then P is irreducible and aperiodic and has no transient states.

Reference-contexts: elements in the rate matrix P for this chain are defined by p i;i+r k = k for 0 i C r k , k = 1; : : : ; C, k q (ir k ) The state probabilities q (i) are computed recursively using a method of Kaufman <ref> [4] </ref>. The examples of x2 are special cases of this model with C = 1 class. Let c j be the "cost" per unit time of being in state j; e.g., the loss rate if the objective is to minimize the loss rate of calls.

The GTH algorithm [1] is an efficient algorithm for determining a factorization of the matrix D P . <p> An Application. This work was motivated by difficulties encountered in computing solutions to the telecommunications model described in Krishnan and Huebner <ref> [5] </ref>. In their model, there are n channels that serve C classes of calls. Class-j calls arrive according to a Poisson process at rate j , have exponential service times with mean 1= j , and each call requires r j channels.

Reference-contexts: Systems analysts are interested in other computational quantities that give information about the short-term behavior of the chain. The fundamental matrix is defined to be F = (D P e) 1 ; and the group generalized inverse is A # F e: (See, for example, <ref> [6] </ref>.) The entries in these matrices are useful in computing mean first passage times, in computing biases in the entries in as approximations to expected number of visits, and in determining decision rules to govern the control of the system. See [2] and [5] for some discussion of these applications.

Reference-contexts: We compute the main diagonal elements of L to satisfy this constraint, rather than using the usual Gaussian elimination formulas. This modification has been shown to provide a very strong form of numerical stability when making use of these factors to compute the stationary vectors <ref> [7] </ref>.
