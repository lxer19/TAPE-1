Abstract: One of the fundamental facts in control theory (Artstein's theorem) is the equivalence, for systems affine in controls, between continuous feedback stabilizability to an equilibrium and the existence of smooth control Lyapunov functions. This equivalence breaks down for general nonlinear systems, not affine in controls. One of the main results in this paper establishes that the existence of smooth Lyapunov functions implies the existence of, in general discontinuous, feedback stabilizers which are insensitive (or robust) to small errors in state measurements. Conversely, it is shown that the existence of such stabilizers in turn implies the existence of smooth control Lyapunov functions. Moreover, it is established that, for general nonlinear control systems under persistently acting disturbances, the existence of smooth Lyapunov functions is equivalent to the existence of (in general, discontinuous) feedback stabilizers which are robust with respect to small measurement errors and small additive external disturbances.

Reference-contexts: : R n ! U such that the origin in R n is asymptotically stable with respect to the trajectories of the closed-loop system _x = f (x; k (x)) : (2) A powerful and popular technique for this purpose relies on smooth control Lyapunov functions (clf 's); see e.g. <ref> [1, 19, 21, 30] </ref>. We review some basic definitions. <p> Indeed, if the control system system (1) is affine in controls, that is to say it has the form f (x; u) = f (x) + g (x)u ; and U R m is a convex set, then by Artstein's theorem <ref> [1] </ref> such a continuous feedback does exist. <p> Moreover, we show that no possible s-stabilizing feedback can be robust with respect to such errors. (The nonexistence of robust feedback means, by Theorem 1, that there is no smooth control Lyapunov function for this example, a fact which was already known, cf. <ref> [1] </ref>.) It is easy to verify that the circles x 2 are integral manifolds for the trajectories of the unperturbed system (46) and, consequently, for the -trajectories of (46) under any feedback as well.

Reference-contexts: Equivalently, for our example, there exists a stabilizing feedback with is continuous also at zero (namely, ff (jxj)k (x)). Now we invoke the Brockett necessary condition <ref> [2] </ref> (see e.g. [30], Theorem 15), which asserts that if for the nonlinear control system (1) there exists a continuous stabilizing feedback, then for some positive and fl, it must be the case that flB f (B; U); (9) where B denotes closed unit ball in R n . <p> Note that in general the existence of a smooth control Lyapunov function is the exception rather than the 7 rule. Even for such a simple asymptotically controllable nonlinear system as the `non--holonomic integrator" <ref> [2] </ref> _x 1 = u 1 _x 3 = x 1 u 2 x 2 u 1 there is no smooth clf. Nevertheless, it was shown in [29] (see also [31]) that for any asymptotically controllable system there exists a continuous control Lyapunov function.

Reference-contexts: is no contradiction with the results presented here.) Although the proof of the "if" part of Theorem 1 is straightforward and self-contained, the "only if" part of this Theorem requires the use of a recent converse Lyapunov function theorem for strongly asymptotically stable differential inclusions with upper semicontin-uous right-hand side <ref> [9] </ref>. It is shown below that if for the control system (13) there exists a stabilizing feedback k which is robust with respect to measurement errors and external disturbances, then the differential inclusion _x 2 F (x) (18) with multivalued right-hand side F (x) := "&gt;0 is strongly asymptotically stable. <p> Since the multifunction F given by (19) is upper semicontinuous, we may invoke the above mentioned converse Lyapunov function theorem from <ref> [9] </ref> for such differential inclusions, in order to obtain the existence of a smooth strong Lyapunov function for the differential inclusion (18)-(19), and then observe that this function is a smooth uniform control Lyapunov function for control system (13). <p> In fact, any discontinuous function k satisfying (15) will be robustly stabilizing. 9 This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains precise statements of robust stabilizability by feedback, and the converse Lyapunov function theorem from <ref> [9] </ref> for differential inclusions with upper semicontinuous right-hand side. The notion of approximate weak invariance of sets with respect to approximate solutions of differential inclusions, with a right-hand side which is bounded on bounded sets, is studied here too. <p> We discuss now some results which are used in the proof of that theorem. Converse Lyapunov function theorem for differential inclusions The first result concerns a converse Lyapunov function theorem for a strongly asymptotically stable differential inclusion (18).

Reference-contexts: In order to explain this result, we need a concept, analogous to that of control Lyapunov function, which is of interest in the context of stabilization under persistent disturbances: a uniform control Lyapunov function (uclf) (cf. [25] and <ref> [15] </ref>, the terminology in the latter reference is "robust control-Lyapunov function (rclf)"). y Definition 1.5 A smooth function V : R n ! R 0 is said to be a smooth uniform control Lyapunov function for the system (13) if V is positive (3), proper (4), and satisfies the following infinitesimal <p> These invariance conditions are applied to obtain the above mentioned tracking result. Finally, we need to point out in this context the generalization of Artstein's theorem, for the case of stabilization under persistent disturbances, obtained by Freeman and Kokotovic <ref> [15] </ref>. They proved, in the case of a control system (13) under persistent disturbances, that if this system is affine in u, then the existence of smooth uclf implies the existence of a continuous stabilizing feedback. <p> To prove a converse theorem, they imposed additional restriction that, for a stabilizing feedback k, the function (x; d) ! f (x; k (x); d) is locally Lipschitz. (On the other hand, the setup in <ref> [15] </ref> is somewhat more general than ours in another aspect, namely in that it allows for state-dependent input and disturbance constraints.) In the present paper, Theorem 1 asserts the existence of a smooth uniform control Lyapunov function for a general nonlinear control system (13) if and only if there exists a

(Evidently, the size of this neighborhood will in general become large when the magnitudes of the disturbances are larger.) In the case when k is continuous and stabilizing, classical results of stability theory <ref> [16, 20] </ref> immediately establish that k is robustly stabilizing in this sense; in the discontinuous case, the proof is more delicate. This fact is established in the current paper.

Note that well-known concepts of generalized solutions of differential equations with discontinuous right-hand side, such as Filippov or Krasovskii solutions <ref> [11, 17, 13] </ref>, are formulated in terms of solutions of appropriate differential inclusions with upper semi-continuous right-hand side. Theorem 2 provides a Lyapunov function characterization of asymptotic stability of these solutions.

Reference-contexts: It was exploited in [8] to show that every asymptotically controllable system can be stabilized by means of some (probably discontinuous) feedback. Its predecessor is the concept of discontinuous positional control developed by Krasovskii and Subbotin in the context of differential games <ref> [22] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: the stabilizing feedback constructed in [8] cannot be robust with respect to measurement errors, and a special effort should be made to ensure these robustness properties. (A "hybrid dynamical" feedback controller, which is robust with respect to small measurement errors and external disturbances, was suggested recently by Ledyaev and Sontag <ref> [24] </ref>. Its design incorporates an "internal model" of the control system (1) driven by the discontinuous stabilizing feedback constructed in [8].

Reference-contexts: In order to explain this result, we need a concept, analogous to that of control Lyapunov function, which is of interest in the context of stabilization under persistent disturbances: a uniform control Lyapunov function (uclf) (cf. <ref> [25] </ref> and [15], the terminology in the latter reference is "robust control-Lyapunov function (rclf)"). y Definition 1.5 A smooth function V : R n !
