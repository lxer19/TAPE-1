Abstract: transforming the projective representation of the 3D scene. In other words, the projective representation of the scene can undergo a projective transformation (which effectively translates the scene along the optical axes of the first view) which is interchangeable with the camera motion from view to view. The interchangeability point is effectively contained in the arguments of [3] about the geometric content of each trilinearity. 1. S. Avidan and A. Shashua. Novel view synthesis in tensor space.
