Abstract: In many robotics applications it is necessary to record precisely how a mobile robot moves around in its environment. This is for instance the case when we want to compare robot behavior with animal behavior, when we want to compare robot behavior in different environments, and when we want to compare behavior in simulated and real robots. For this purpose, we have built a video tracking system using the Matrox Meteor Frame-grabber. By placing a camera above an arena and putting light on top of a mobile robot, we are able to track the movements of the robot using the tracking algorithm described in this paper.

Reference-contexts: The inspiration for this tracking set-up is found in the CARS system <ref> [1] </ref>. 2 Matrox Meteor Capture Card Driver: About the driver The frame-grabber used in our system is the Matrox Meteor Card 1 . A computer that supports the PCI interface bus is needed and it is recommended that the system has a minimum of 16 MB of RAM. <p> Another approach would be to predict the robot's current position based on the previous tracking, and use the predicted centre position as the centre of the window. The prediction of the target's (i.e. robot's) motion would be based on a simple dynamical model (see e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>). This approach demands a few more calculations than the approach of using the previously tracked position as the centre of the new window. On the other hand, it might allow use of a smaller window.

Reference-contexts: Other experiments, where a description of the robot trajectory is crucial, include our Evolutionary Robotics experiments where we evolve robot controllers (e.g. neurocontrollers) and/or robot body plans in a simulator before transferring the evolved systems to real robots, e.g. <ref> [3, 2] </ref>. In these Evolutionary Robotics experiments it is crucial to show the nature of the mapping between the behavior in simulation and reality.

Reference-contexts: Assuming a limited speed for the robot, the next window can be one with its centre at the last calculated position. Hence, the appropriate window size is determined by the speed of the robot. In our case, we work with the Khepera miniature robot <ref> [4] </ref>, which at maximum speed (approximately 1m/sec.) can not move very far during the sample time (20 millisec.) of the frame-grabber. Therefore, we can use a quite small window size.

Reference-contexts: For this purpose, we need an accurate documentation of the robot behavior, which we achieve using the tracking system. An example of such experiments is our robotics experiments in cricket pho-notaxis <ref> [5] </ref>.
