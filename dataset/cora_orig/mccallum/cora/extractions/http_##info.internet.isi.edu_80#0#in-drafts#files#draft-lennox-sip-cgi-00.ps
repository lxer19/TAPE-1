Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as work in progress.

Abstract In Internet telephony, there must be a means by which new services are created and deployed rapidly. In the World Wide Web, the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) has served as popular means towards programming web services. Due to the similarities between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), CGI seems a good candidate for service creation in a SIP environment. This draft proposes a SIP-CGI interface for providing SIP services on a SIP server.

Rosenberg, SIP: </author> <title> session initiation protocol, </title> <type> Internet Draft, </type> <institution> Internet Engineering Task Force, </institution> <month> Sept. </month> <year> 1998. </year> <title> Work in progress. </title>
Reference-contexts: Multimedia communications, including Internet telephony, will also require a mechanism for creating services. This mechanism is strongly tied to the features provided by the signaling protocols. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <ref> [1] </ref> has been developed for initiation and termination of multimedia sessions. SIP borrows heavily from HTTP, inheriting its client-server interaction and much of its syntax and semantics. <p> See [HTTP-CGI:4.12]. TBD: specify the syntax of this field for digest and pgp authentication. 5.3.10 REQUEST METHOD If the message triggering the script was a request, the method with which the request was made, as described in section 4.2 of the SIP/2.0 specification <ref> [1] </ref>; otherwise NULL. REQUEST METHOD = sip-method sip-method = INVITE j BYE j OPTIONS j CANCEL j REGISTER j extension-method extension-method = token Note that ACK is not appropriate for the SIP-CGI/1.1 environment. <p> The implications of REGISTER in the CGI context are discussed in section 5.9. 5.3.11 REQUEST URI This meta-variable is specific to requests made with SIP. REQUEST URI = SIP-URL ; SIP-URL is defined in ; section 2 of <ref> [1] </ref>. If the message triggering the script was a request, this variable indicates the URI specified with the request method. This variable is only present if REQUEST METHOD is non-NULL. This meta-variable fills the roles of HTTP-CGI's SCRIPT NAME, PATH INFO, and QUERY STRING. J. <p> This meta-variable fills the roles of HTTP-CGI's SCRIPT NAME, PATH INFO, and QUERY STRING. J.

Reference-contexts: Component Reuse: Many of the CGI utilities allow for easy reading of environment variables, parsing of form data, and often parsing and generation of header fields. Since SIP reuses the basic RFC822 <ref> [2] </ref> syntax of HTTP, many of these tools are applicable to SIP CGI. Familiar Environment: Many web programmers are familiar with CGI. Ease of extensibility: Since CGI is an interface and not a language, it becomes easy to extend and reapply to other protocols, such as SIP. J.

Reference-contexts: In essence, what evolved was a means for service creation in a web environment. There are now many means for creation of dynamic web content, including server side JavaScript, servlets, and the common gateway interface (CGI) <ref> [3] </ref>. Multimedia communications, including Internet telephony, will also require a mechanism for creating services. This mechanism is strongly tied to the features provided by the signaling protocols. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1] has been developed for initiation and termination of multimedia sessions. <p> It is simply stored. When the script is re-executed, the cookie is passed back to the script through an environment variable. 5 SIP CGI Specification 5.1 Introduction 5.1.1 Relationship with HTTP CGI This SIP CGI specification is based on work-in-progress revision 1.1 of the HTTP CGI standard <ref> [3] </ref>. This document is a product of the informal CGI-WG, which is not an official IETF working group at this time. CGI-WG's homepage is located at the URL http://Web.Golux.Com/coar/cgi/, and the most recent versions of the CGI specification are available there.

Reference-contexts: document will refer to sections from the HTTP-CGI specification, as [HTTP-CGI:xx], rather than repeat information from that document verbatim. 5.1.2 Terminology In this document, the key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <ref> [4] </ref> and indicate requirement levels for compliant SIP CGI implementations. 5.1.3 Specifications The terms system defined and implementation defined are used to refer to functions and features of SIP CGI which are not defined in the main part of this specification. The definitions of these can be found in [HTTP-CGI:1.3].

Reference-contexts: A message is a SIP request or response, typically either the one that triggered the invocation of the CGI script, or one that the CGI script caused to be sent. 5.2 Notational Conventions and Generic Grammar In this specification we use the Augmented Backus-Naur Form notation described in RFC 2234 <ref> [5] </ref>. The basic rules described in [HTTP-CGI:2.2] are used to describe basic parsing constructs. 5.3 Message Metadata (Meta-Variables) Each SIP-CGI implementation MUST define a mechanism to pass data about the message from the server to the script.

Reference-contexts: For locally generated responses (see section 5.8), this should be the loopback address (i.e. 127.0.0.1 for IPv4). 5.3.7 REMOTE HOST This is the hostname of the host sending the message to this server. See [HTTP-CGI:4.10]. 5.3.8 REMOTE IDENT The identity information supported about the connection by a RFC 1413 <ref> [6] </ref> request, if available; see [HTTP-CGI:4.11].
