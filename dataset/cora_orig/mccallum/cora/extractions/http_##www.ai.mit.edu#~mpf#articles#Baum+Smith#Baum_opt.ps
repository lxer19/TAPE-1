Abstract: We consider the approach to game playing where one looks ahead in a game tree, evaluates heuristically the probability of winning at the leaves, and then propagates this evaluation up the tree. We show that minimax does not make optimal use of information contained in the leaf evaluations, and in fact misvalues the position associated with all nodes. This occurs because when actually playing a position down the game tree, a player would be able to search beyond the boundaries of the original search, and so has access to additional information. The remark that such extra information will exist, allows better use of the information contained in the leaf evaluations even though we do not have access to the extra information itself. Our analysis implies that, while minimax is approximately correct near the top of the game tree, near the bottom a formula closer to the probability product formula is better. We propose a simple model of how deep search yields extra information about the chances of winning in a position. Within the context of this model, we write down the formula for propagating information up the tree which is correct at all levels. We generalize our results to the case when the outcomes at the leaves are correlated and also to games like chess where there are three possible outcomes: Win, Lose, and Draw. Experiments demonstrate our formula's superiority to minimax and probability product in the game of Kalah. It is well known that minimax is an optimal game playing strategy provided the whole game tree can be searched (Von Neumann & Morgenstern 1947). For complex games such as chess, limitations in computational resources allow only a partial search. (Shannon 1950) proposed that a computer might play chess by searching to a depth d, evaluating the positions found using some heuristic evaluation function, and then using minimax to propagate values up the search tree. (Pearl 1984) proposed the probability product rule as an alternative to minimax. This proposal was based on the assumption that the heuristic evaluation function estimates the probability that the position is a win against best play, and then follows from the remark that the correct way to combine (independent) probabilities is by probability product. This reasoning correctly asserts that a position with 100 alternative moves, each of which has independently .1 probability of leading to a won game, is almost certainly a won position. We observe here that this offers little solace to the player in this position, if he can not figure out which moves lead to wins, for he must choose one particular move, and then loses with probabity .9. This paper studies how optimal game play is affected by the computational limitations of the players. Due to these limitations, the game is effectively one of imperfect information, and this information is effectively asymmetric. Neither Minimax nor Probability Product takes account of this. We describe a strategy which does. Imagine playing the following game, game 1. Player A makes either move A1 or move A2. Then player B makes either move B1 or B2. Then player A pays player B $1 with probability P ij for i = A1 or A2 and j = B1 or B2. Let P 11 = :5; P 12 = :5; P 21 = :6; P 22 = :1. Now player A should follow the optimal minimax strategy and make move 1, and the expected payoff to player B will be .5. Now imagine a slightly different game. The rules of game 2 are the same as game 1 except that after player A moves, but before player B moves, the payoffs are generated according to P ij , and player B is told what the outcome of his moves would be. Now if player A chooses move 1, there will be probability 1 (1 :5) 2 = :75 that player B will have a move which wins for him. If player A chooses move 2, however, then the expected payoff for player B is only 1 :4 fi :9 = :64. Accordingly player A must change his strategy from the first game. x1: Introduction

Reference-contexts: Since this detailed information seems likely to be difficult to obtain in practice, we have proposed a simple formula for propagating information up the game tree. This model requires only limited, and readily obtainable estimates of the extra information. It is exact in widely studied models <ref> (e.g. Schrufer 1986.) </ref> Experiments in the game of Kalah exhibit the superiority of this formula to both minimax and probability product.

Reference-contexts: Minimax won 18359 games against PP, while PP won 1581, and 60 were drawn. 2.6 won 18882 against PP, while PP won 1040, and 78 were drawn. Note that probability product was awful, which is attributable to its poor treatment of correlations <ref> (Smith 1992) </ref>. Note that (excluding draws) formula 2.6 beats minimax 52 :03% of the games.
