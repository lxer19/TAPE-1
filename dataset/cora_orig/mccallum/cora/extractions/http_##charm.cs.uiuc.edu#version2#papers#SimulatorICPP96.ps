Abstract: Simulation studies are quite useful for performance prediction on new architectures and for systematic analysis of performance perturbations caused by variations in the machine parameters, such as communication latencies. Trace-driven simulation is necessary to avoid large computational costs over multiple simulation runs. However, trace-driven simulation of nondeterministic programs has turned out to be almost impossible. Simulation of message-driven programs is particularly challenging in this context because they are inherently nondeterministic. Yet message-driven execution is a very effective technique for enhancing performance, particularly in the presence of large or unpredictable communication latencies. We present a methodology for simulating message-driven programs. The information that is necessary to carry out such simulations is identified, and a method for extracting such information from program executions is described.

Reference-contexts: The technique is not limited to the Dagger language. It can be extended to other parallel programming languages such as CC++ <ref> [1] </ref>, OCCAM with some modification. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the message-driven execution and the Dagger coordination language. Section 3 discusses the simulation of Dagger programs. The abstract machine model that is used by the simulator is explained in Section 4.
