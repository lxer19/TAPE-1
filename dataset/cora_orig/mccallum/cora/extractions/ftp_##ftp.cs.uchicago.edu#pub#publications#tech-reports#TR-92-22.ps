Abstract: This article introduces a new indexing technique based on boundary histograms. For multicolored objects boundary histograms record estimates of the boundary lengths between different discrete colors in an image. Boundary histograms are small and insensitive to noise. To identify images we apply a match function to their boundary histograms. The match function that we derive handles occlusions and distracting pixels in the background of an object gracefully. The robustness and the low complexity of the match function together with its ability to distinguish many objects allow us to use boundary histograms as an index for large image databases. Test results illustrate the above mentioned features of boundary histograms and the match function.

Reference-contexts: In these systems image signatures can be used to identify moving objects, provided that the image signatures are invariant under rotations of objects <ref> (Ballard & Brown, 1992) </ref>. In general, the shape of an object provides a great deal of information about its identity. But the extraction of geometrical cues and the subsequent matching may require extensive processing (see e.g. Huttenlocher & Ullman 1987). Furthermore, many geometrical cues are highly resolution and view dependent.

Reference-contexts: Hence, indexing algorithms have to be very efficient in order to be useful. If database queries can be completed very quickly, then their results can be used to solve problems such as visual homing (Nelson, 1991) and place recognition <ref> (Engelson & McDermott, 1991) </ref>. Unfortunately, the image signatures that Nel-son, Engelson and McDermott use as indexes are not invariant under rotations of objects. Thus, their image signatures can be used only to describe static scenes.

Reference-contexts: In general, the shape of an object provides a great deal of information about its identity. But the extraction of geometrical cues and the subsequent matching may require extensive processing <ref> (see e.g. Huttenlocher & Ullman 1987) </ref>. Furthermore, many geometrical cues are highly resolution and view dependent. Several researchers have used color as a cue to segment objects (Feldman & Yakimovsky 1974, Ohlander et. al. 1978, Garvey 1986, Fathima 1992).

Reference-contexts: Since the color histograms which Swain and Ballard use for their algorithm contain 1 absolutely no geometrical information, their algorithm fails on such images. To make their method illuminant independent they suggest to preprocess all the images with a color constancy algorithm <ref> (Klinker et. al. 1988, Forsyth 1990, Novak & Shafer 1990) </ref>. To combine this step of preprocessing with the histograming, Funt and Finlayson (1991) propose to use ratio histograms. Ratio histograms encode change of color together with an estimate of edge length.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, we define a metric on this space. Using the metric we can measure the distance between two feature vectors, i.e., two boundary histograms. This is the traditional approach of pattern recognition <ref> (Young & Fu, 1986) </ref>.
