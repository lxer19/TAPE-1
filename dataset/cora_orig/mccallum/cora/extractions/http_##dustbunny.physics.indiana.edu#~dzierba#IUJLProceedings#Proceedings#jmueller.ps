Reference-contexts: 1 The 1 Nonet and Experimental Status In the constituent quark model for mesons <ref> [1] </ref>, the 1 + nonet consists of a bound quark-antiquark pair in a spin singlet state, with one unit of angular momentum. This leads to a J P C = 1 + . These states can be reached through a photo-excitation of the pseudoscalar nonet.

Reference-contexts: The b 1 (1235) has been studied extensively,[2] while less is known about the h 1 (1170)[2]. Inconclusive evidence for the h 0 1 (h 1 (1380)) has been published by one experiment <ref> [3] </ref> using the LASS detector. This involved a partial-wave analysis of (K fl K) near threshold in the reaction K p ! flKK.

Reference-contexts: Recently, the Crystal Barrel collaboration has analyzed the reaction pp ! K 0 L K 0 and see evidence in their partial-wave analysis for a 1 + state in K fl K <ref> [4] </ref>. The reported mass and width from these two analyses are presented in Table 1.1.It is unclear how much of the difference could be due to different treatments of threshold effects.

Reference-contexts: In this region of t and s, diffractive production is assumed to dominate. They determined that fi BR 500 nb and 300 nb for the two processes respectively <ref> [5] </ref>. They did not see any structure for flp ! K fl Kp [6].
