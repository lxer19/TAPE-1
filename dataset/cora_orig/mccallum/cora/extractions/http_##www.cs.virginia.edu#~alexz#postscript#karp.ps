Title: New Approximation Algorithms for the Steiner Tree Problems  
Author: Marek Karpinski Alexander Zelikovsky 
Abstract: The Steiner tree problem asks for the shortest tree connecting a given set of terminal points in a metric space. We design new approximation algorithms for the Steiner tree problems using a novel technique of choosing Steiner points in dependence on the possible deviation from the optimal solutions. We achieve the best up to now approximation ratios of 1.644 in arbitrary metric and 1.267 in rectilinear plane, respectively.

Consideration of k-restricted Steiner trees gave several better heuristics cf [4]. <p> The main their idea is to decrease the cost of MST (S) adding Steiner points to the initial terminal set. For NSP, the performance ratio of the greedy algorithm (GA) (Zelikovsky [20, 22]) is at most 11 6 1:84 and PR of Berman-Ramaiyer's heuristic (BR) <ref> [2] </ref> is at most 16 9 1:78. Their run-times are O (v 3 ) and O (ff + v 2 n 3 ), respectively (here ff means time complexity of finding of all pairs shortest paths). <p> The relative greedy heuristic (RGH) (Zelikovsky [23]) with PR converging to 1 + ln 2 1:693 asymptotically beats BR which PR converges to about 1.734 (Brochers and Du [6]). In the recent paper Berman et al. [3] gave a more precise (than in the first papers <ref> [21, 2, 8] </ref>) analysis of the performance ratio and runtime of BR for RSP. They proved that its performance ratio is at most 61 48 1:271. <p> Let R (T ) denote the set of MST-edges substituted with T in the tree X (T ). R (T ) consists of the edges of the largest cost on the paths in M ST (D) connecting pairs of terminals of T <ref> [2] </ref>. Denote by m (T ) = mst (D) mst (D [ E (T )) the cost of R (T ). Thus, g (T ) = m (T ) d (T ). <p> Thus, g (T ) = m (T ) d (T ). Note, that addition of any edges to D may only decrease m (T ) and the gain of T <ref> [2] </ref>, therefore, g (fT i ; i = 1; :::; pg) i=1 By contraction of T we mean addition of E (T ) to D. A greedy algorithm (GA) [20] finds a 3-tree with the biggest gain and conracts it while there are 3-trees with a positive gain. <p> All contracted 3-trees and the rest of MST-edges form the output Steiner tree. The k-restricted relative greedy heuristic (k-RGH) [23] runs simalar to GA but maximizing (among all k-trees T ) m (T )=d (T ) instead of m (T ) d (T ). Berman-Ramaiyer <ref> [2] </ref> suggested a sofisticated generalization of GA for an arbitrary k (k-BR). k-BR proceesses all i-trees, i = 1; :::; k, with a positive gain modifying the set D and forming a stack of i-trees chosen. <p> We denote by t k = t k (S) a supremum of mst (D [ E k ) over all E k 's. The output cost of GA [20] (k = 3) and k-BR <ref> [2] </ref> is at most t 2 i=3 i 1 t 2 + i=3 (i 1)i t k (2) To bound the values t k , Berman-Ramayer [2] introduced the following useful definition. A Steiner tree is k-restricted, if every its full component is a k-tree. <p> The output cost of GA [20] (k = 3) and k-BR <ref> [2] </ref> is at most t 2 i=3 i 1 t 2 + i=3 (i 1)i t k (2) To bound the values t k , Berman-Ramayer [2] introduced the following useful definition. A Steiner tree is k-restricted, if every its full component is a k-tree. Let ST k (S) denote a minimal k-restricted Steiner tree and st k (S) denote its cost. This way, ST 2 (S) is the minimum spanning tree M ST (S). <p> This way, ST 2 (S) is the minimum spanning tree M ST (S). By (1), the gain of any k-restricted Steiner tree is non-positive in &lt; S; D [ E k &gt;, therefore, st k (S) t k (S) <ref> [2] </ref>. These values may not coincide: In the rectilinear plane, for the set S = f (1; 0); (0; 1)g, st 3 (S) = 5 and t 3 (S) = 4:5. <p> For NSP, some r k were evaluated in [20, 1, 7] and, finally, Brochers and Du [6] proved that for k = 2 r + l, r k = sup s (r + 1)2 r + l : (3) For the rectilinear metric, r k 2k 2k1 for r 3 <ref> [2] </ref>, moreover, for any instance of RSP, t 2 + t 4 2:5s and 3t 2 + 4t 3 9s [3]. The bounds for t k and r k combined with the bound (2) give the preformance guarantee of GA and k-BR mentioned in the previous section. <p> In the graph G 0 obtained, we can choose a minimum spanning tree M in which any pair u; v 2 S is connected by paths containing only terminals of S. It is proved in <ref> [2] </ref> that the d (M ) = mst (G 0 ) = mst (G) and for any k-tree K, the cost of R (K) is the same in G and G 0 . Consider a subgraph H of G 0 induced by the vertax set S. <p> Since the relative cost function coincides with the usual cost function for 2-restricted Steiner trees, d 0 (T ) mst (S) (8) Berman and Ramaiyer <ref> [2] </ref> proved that if the cost function satisfies properties (7-8) then the output tree of the usual r-BR has a gain at least P r t i1 t i i1 (compare with (2)). r-BRP coincides with r-BR applied to the relative cost function d 0 instead of d.

The main their idea is to decrease the cost of MST (S) adding Steiner points to the initial terminal set. For NSP, the performance ratio of the greedy algorithm (GA) (Zelikovsky <ref> [20, 22] </ref>) is at most 11 6 1:84 and PR of Berman-Ramaiyer's heuristic (BR) [2] is at most 16 9 1:78. Their run-times are O (v 3 ) and O (ff + v 2 n 3 ), respectively (here ff means time complexity of finding of all pairs shortest paths).

The relative greedy heuristic (RGH) (Zelikovsky <ref> [23] </ref>) with PR converging to 1 + ln 2 1:693 asymptotically beats BR which PR converges to about 1.734 (Brochers and Du [6]). <p> A greedy algorithm (GA) [20] finds a 3-tree with the biggest gain and conracts it while there are 3-trees with a positive gain. All contracted 3-trees and the rest of MST-edges form the output Steiner tree. The k-restricted relative greedy heuristic (k-RGH) <ref> [23] </ref> runs simalar to GA but maximizing (among all k-trees T ) m (T )=d (T ) instead of m (T ) d (T ). <p> The bounds for t k and r k combined with the bound (2) give the preformance guarantee of GA and k-BR mentioned in the previous section. It was proved in <ref> [23] </ref> that the output cost of k-RGH is at most (1 + ln (r 2 =r k ))r k . Since lim k!1 r k = 1, the limit performance ratio of k-RGH for NSP is at most 1 + ln 2.
