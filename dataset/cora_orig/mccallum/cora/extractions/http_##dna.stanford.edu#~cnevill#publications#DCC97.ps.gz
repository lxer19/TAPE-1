Reference-contexts: madding crowd, encoding can be performed on average every 14 symbols: the minimum interval is one, which is guaranteed to be the case after the very first symbol has been received, and the maximum interval is 161. 4 Compression in the large The performance of SEQUITUR on the Calgary Corpus <ref> (Bell et al. , 1990) </ref> was measured in 1994 as 2.70 bits/character (Nevill-Manning et al. , 1994), a little better than that of LZFG (Fiala and Green, 1989), the best macro compressor at the time the corpus was created, which rates 2.95 bits/character.

Since then the performance on the corpus of the newer macro compressor gzip has been measured at 2.69 bits/character (see Witten et al., 1994, for a description of gzip).

Reference-contexts: Searching the grammar is performed by hash table lookup. Assuming an occupancy less than, say, 80% gives an average lookup time bounded by a constant <ref> (Knuth, 1973) </ref>. This occupancy can be assured if the size of the sequence is known in advance, or by enlarging the table and recreating the entries whenever occupancy exceeds 80%.

Reference-contexts: Second, we show that a sequence can be compressed incrementally, improving on the non-incremental algorithm that was described by Nevill-Manning et al. (1994), and making online compression feasible. Third, we present an intriguing result that emerged during benchmarking; whereas PPMC <ref> (Moffat, 1990) </ref> outperforms SEQUITUR on most files in the Calgary corpus, S EQUITUR regains the lead when tested on multi-megabyte sequences.
