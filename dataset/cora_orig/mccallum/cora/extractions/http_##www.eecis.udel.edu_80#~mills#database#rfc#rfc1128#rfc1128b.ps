Reference-contexts: Subnet peers calculate clock offset and delay between them using timestamps with 200 picosecond resolution exchanged at intervals of up to about 17 minutes. As explained in [MIL89a], the protocol uses a distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm <ref> [BER87] </ref> to construct minimum-weight spanning trees within the subnet based on hierarchical level and total synchronization path delay to the root.

Reference-contexts: The third service operated by NIST uses ultra-high frequency (UHF or CCIR band 9) transmissions from the Geosynchronous Orbiting Environmental Satellite (GOES). There is some speculation on the continued operation of GOES, especially if the LORAN-C [FRA82] and Global Positioning System (GPS) <ref> [BES82] </ref> radiopositioning systems operated by other U.S. agencies continue to evolve as expected. While the OMEGA [VAS78] radionavigation system operated by the U.S. Navy and other countries can in principle provide worldwide frequency and time distribution, this system is unlikely to long survive the operational deployment of GPS. 1.2.

Reference-contexts: While these services and those operated by the National Research Council of Canada (CHU) and other countries can be received over large areas of the world, reliable frequency comparisons can be made only to the order of 10 -7 and time accuracies are limited to the order of a millisecond <ref> [BLA74] </ref>. A second service operated by NIST is the low-frequency (LF or CCIR band 5) transmissions from Boulder, CO (WWVB), which can be received over the continental U.S. and adjacent coastal areas. <p> With appropriate receiving and averaging techniques and corrections for diurnal and seasonal propagation effects, frequency comparisons to within 10 -11 are possible and time accuracies of from a few to 50 microseconds can be obtained <ref> [BLA74] </ref>. However, there is only one station and it operates at modest power levels. The third service operated by NIST uses ultra-high frequency (UHF or CCIR band 9) transmissions from the Geosynchronous Orbiting Environmental Satellite (GOES). <p> In the case of the NBS WWVB service on 60 kHz, the variations in path delay are relatively well understood and limited to the order of 50 microseconds <ref> [BLA74] </ref>.

Further analysis and experimental results bearing on this issue can be found in <ref> [COL88] </ref>, [MIL85a] and [MIL85b]. The computed offsets are first filtered to reduce stochastic noise and then evaluated to determine the most accurate and reliable selection among usually several peers.

Reference-contexts: Besides NTP, there are several protocols designed to distribute time in local-area networks, including the DAYTIME protocol [POS83a], TIME Protocol [POS83b], ICMP Timestamp message <ref> [DAR81] </ref> and IP Timestamp option [SU81]. The DCN routing protocol incorporates time synchronization directly into the routing protocol using algorithms similar to NTP [MIL83]. <p> The program accumulates error messages and sample data for up to eight samples in each of the three time protocols. It abandons a host upon receipt of an ICMP error message <ref> [DAR81] </ref> and abandons further hosts on the same network upon receipt of an ICMP net-unreachable message. Using this procedure, attempts were made to read the clock for 107,799 distinct host addresses.

Reference-contexts: The DCN routing protocol incorporates time synchronization directly into the routing protocol using algorithms similar to NTP [MIL83]. The Unix 4.3bsd time daemon timed uses a single master-time daemon to measure offsets of a number of slave hosts and send periodic corrections to them <ref> [GUS85] </ref>. However, these protocols do not include engineered algorithms to compensate for the effects of statistical delay variations encountered on wide-area networks and are unsuitable for precision time distribution throughout the Internet. 1.3.

Reference-contexts: As in previous surveys of this type, statistics based on the sample median yield more accurate results than those based on the sample mean. However, results for the trimmed mean (also called Fault-Tolerant Average <ref> [KOP87] </ref>) with 25% of the samples removed are within a millisecond of the values shown in Table 2. The reduced delay for the filtered data is an artifact of the filtering algorithm.

This experiment is an update of previous experiments conducted in 1985 <ref> [MIL85b] </ref> and early 1988 [MIL88a].

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction How do hosts and gateways in a large, dispersed networking community know what time it is? How accurate are their clocks? In a 1988 survey involving 5,722 hosts and gateways of the Internet system <ref> [MIL88a] </ref>, 1158 provided their local time via the network. Sixty percent of the replies had errors greater than one minute, while ten percent had errors greater than 13 minutes. A few had errors as much as two years. <p> Discovering Internet Timetellers An experiment designed to discover Internet timeserving hosts and evaluate the quality of their indications was conducted over a nine-day interval in August 1989. This experiment is an update of previous experiments conducted in 1985 [MIL85b] and early 1988 <ref> [MIL88a] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: NTP and its forebears were developed and tested on PDP11 computers and the Fuzzball operating system, which was designed specifically for timekeeping precisions of a millisecond or better <ref> [MIL88b] </ref>. An implementation of NTP as a Unix 4.3bsd system daemon called ntpd was built by Michael Petry and Louis Mamakos at the University of Maryland. A special-purpose hardware/software implementation of NTP was built be Dennis Ferguson at the University of Toronto. <p> The experiment itself was conducted with the aid of the control file and a specially constructed experiment program written for the Fuzzball operating system <ref> [MIL88b] </ref>. The data were collected using experiment hosts located at the University of Delaware and connected to the University of Delaware campus network and SURA regional network. The experiment program reads each entry from the control file in turn and sends timerequest messages to the first Internet address found.

Reference-contexts: RFC 1128 Performance of the Network Time Protocol October 1989 Mills Page 1 Further information on the background, model and algorithms can be found in <ref> [MIL89a] </ref>, while details of the latest NTP protocol specification can be found in [MIL89b]. 1.1. <p> Secondary time servers synchronize to the primary servers and others in the configured subnet using NTP. Subnet peers calculate clock offset and delay between them using timestamps with 200 picosecond resolution exchanged at intervals of up to about 17 minutes. As explained in <ref> [MIL89a] </ref>, the protocol uses a distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm [BER87] to construct minimum-weight spanning trees within the subnet based on hierarchical level and total synchronization path delay to the root. <p> A number of algorithms for deglitching and filtering time-offset data are summarized in <ref> [MIL89a] </ref>, including trimmed-mean and various kinds of nonlinear filters. The NTP Version 1 protocol used a type of median filter in which a window consisting of the last n sample offsets is continuously updated and the median sample selected as the estimate.

Reference-contexts: RFC 1128 Performance of the Network Time Protocol October 1989 Mills Page 1 Further information on the background, model and algorithms can be found in [MIL89a], while details of the latest NTP protocol specification can be found in <ref> [MIL89b] </ref>. 1.1. Standard Time and Frequency Dissemination In order that atomic and civil time can be coordinated throughout the world, national administrations operate primary time and frequency standards and maintain Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by observing various radio broadcasts and through occasional use of portable atomic clocks. <p> This is the basis of the NTP Version 2 algorithm described in detail in <ref> [MIL89b] </ref>. occasional errors up to several seconds are apparent. Figure 5 shows the time-offset series filtered by the NTP Version 2 algorithm, in which large errors have been dramatically reduced and may even reveal a subtle diurnal traffic variation over this path.

Reference-contexts: This method amounts to a continuously sampled, returnable-time system, which is used in some digital telephone networks <ref> [MIT80] </ref>. Among the advantages are that the order and timing of the messages are unimportant and that reliable delivery is not required. Obviously, the accuracies achievable depend upon the statistical properties of the outbound and inbound data paths.

Reference-contexts: The NIC host table as of 10 August 1989 contained 6382 distinct host and gateway addresses. With the proliferation of the Internet domain-name system used to resolve host addresses from host names <ref> [MOC87] </ref>, the NIC host table has become increasingly inadequate as a discovery vehicle for working host addresses. In a comprehensive survey of the domain-name system, Mark Lotter of SRI International recently compiled a revised host table of 137,484 entries.
