Abstract: Two methods are presented for static timing verification of sequential circuits implemented as a mix of static and domino logic. Constraints for proper operation of domino gates are derived. An important observation is that input signals to domino gates may start changing near the end of the evaluate phase. The first method models domino gates explicitly, similar to latches. The second method treats domino gates only during pre- and post-processing steps. This method is shown to be more conservative, but easier to compute.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Domino logic is popular for high-performance microprocessors where high clock frequencies are required. Domino logic, a form of dynamic logic, has the advantage of small area, fast operation, and low power <ref> [1] </ref>. However the use of domino logic has been restricted mainly to full custom designs, in part because of the difficulty of verification. Not only do electrical effects such as charge sharing need to be verified, the timing of the circuits is also critical. <p> This paper addresses the timing verification of sequential circuits consisting of both static logic and domino logic. The characteristic timing constraint for domino gates was stated in Krambecks paper <ref> [1] </ref>: All nodes can make at most only a single (rising) transition and then must stay there until the next precharge. Most work in static timing analysis of sequential circuits has not considered domino logic. Venkat et al. [2], described timing verification methodology for domino circuits.

Reference-contexts: Most work in static timing analysis of sequential circuits has not considered domino logic. Venkat et al. <ref> [2] </ref>, described timing verification methodology for domino circuits. The focal points of their work are the identification of dynamic nodes, constraint generation for verifying the operation of the dynamic logic gates, and handling gated clocks.

Reference-contexts: The actual verification methods are described in Section 5. A detailed example illustrating the models important features is provided in the Section 6. Concluding remarks follow. 2 Static timing analysis A comprehensive model for analyzing the temporal behavior of synchronous sequential circuits, the SMO model, is described in <ref> [4] </ref>. These sequential circuits are composed of an interconnection of static combinational logic and synchronizers. The synchronizers can either be level-sensitive (latches), or edge-triggered (ip-ops). The SMO model assumes a multi-phase clocking system with common clock period .
