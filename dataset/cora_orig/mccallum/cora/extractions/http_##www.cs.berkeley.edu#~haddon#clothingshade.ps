Title: The appearance of clothing

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate a program that groups image folds according to the predictions of a linearized buckling model of cloth. Folds in cloth are roughly straight, roughly parallel, and roughly evenly spaced. These geometric properties inform a grouping process that can segment an image and produce segments that are likely to correspond to human clothing. The method is demonstrated on images of real scenes.

Reference-contexts: This is why it is hard to determine the pattern in a stained glass window by looking at the floor at foot of the window. This is known as the linearised Von Karman-Donnell equation; D is a measurable material property termed flexural rigidity <ref> [4, 20] </ref>. 3.1 Compression buckling Consider a person wearing a reasonably tight T-shirt and bending forward at the torso. A fair model of the shirt is a rectangular plate with zero offset at its boundaries. <p> It is usual to use a model of the folds of the form: w (x; ) = w mn sin n a sin L where w represents the displacement from the undeformed cylinder <ref> [4] </ref>. The constants n and m represent the number of waves around the cylinder and the slope of those waves, respectively. The prediction for m is unreliable and only useful at the point where the applied force is near the critical force; we do not consider its value. <p> folds. 3.3 Qualitative predictions While the linearised Von Karman-Donnell equation is known to be a dubious source of predictions of buckling force, the frequencies of the eigenfunctions are accepted as fair predictions of the buckling mode for the cases described (this is the topic of a huge literature, introduced in <ref> [4] </ref>). The eigenfunctions allow us to predict that garments buckling in compression or torsion will display long, nearly straight folds that are nearly parallel and nearly evenly spaced. These folds will be approximately perpendicular to the direction of compression and will indicate the direction of the torsion.

Reference-contexts: This shading model is used to generate predicted shading cross-sections for a large collection of folds of random shape. The cross-sections are used to train a support vector machine <ref> [5] </ref>. The result is an oriented operator that responds to folds at a given scale; in practice, the operator is relatively insensitive to scale. 4.2 Grouping folds We apply the fold finder to the image at twelve different orientations.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Changes in surface brightness are a powerful cue to the shape of a surface. It is therefore natural that computer vision researchers, starting with Horn in [10], have attempted to extract shape information from image shading. This line of study, comprehensively summed up in Brooks' book <ref> [11] </ref>, views shading as a local effect; surface brightness is modelled as a product of a visibility term and a non-negative function of the Gauss map, leading to a partial differential equation|the image irradiance equation|which expresses the relationship between surface geometry and image brightness.

This shading model is used to generate predicted shading cross-sections for a large collection of folds of random shape. The cross-sections are used to train a support vector machine [5].
