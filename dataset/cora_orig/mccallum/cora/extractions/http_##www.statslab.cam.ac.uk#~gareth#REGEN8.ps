Abstract: In many applications of Markov chains, and especially in Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, the rate of convergence of the chain is of critical importance. Most techniques to establish such rates require bounds on the distribution of the random regeneration time T that can be constructed, via splitting techniques, at times of return to a "small set" C satisfying a minorization condition P (x; ) "'(); x 2 C. Typically, however, it is much easier to get bounds on the time t C of return to the small set itself, usually based on a geometric drift function P V V + b1l C . We develop a new relationship between T and t C , and this gives a bound on the tail of T , based on "; and b, which is a strict improvement on existing results. When evaluating rates of convergence we see that our bound usually gives considerable numerical improvement on previous expressions.

Note that on C c these are identical. <p> The splitting construction using ' and R, due to Nummelin [10] and Athreya and Ney [1], provides a rapid route to proving limit theorems for Markov chains. In particular, for Harris chains <ref> [8] </ref> it gives simple proofs of well known results such as kP n (x; ) k ! 0; x 2 X; (4) where kk := 2 sup A (A) is the total variation norm of a signed measure . <p> functions G (fi) = E [fi t C ]; b G (fi) = E [fi C ]; it is known that X being geometrically ergodic is equivalent to G (fi) &lt; 1 for some fi &gt; 1 (that is, to t C having geometrically decreasing tails), at least for suitable <ref> [8, Chapter 15] </ref>, including initial distributions concentrated on single points ( = ffi x ) for -a.e. x. 2 Bounds on generating functions of regeneration times 3 Also define the generating function H (fi) = E [fi T ]; fi &lt; fi fl ; for the regeneration times; here fi fl <p> It is standard <ref> [8, 6] </ref> that for such a V and for all fi 1 we have E y [fi t C ] V (y); y 62 C; (11) and so in particular since V 1 on C b G ( 1 ) = E [ C ] (V ) ( E [V ]) <p> P V 0 MT V 0 + b 0 1l ff (18) where MT = [ + b="]=[1 + b="]; b 0 = b + b=": (19) Suppose then that there is at least one solution to (9); note that if G fl ( 1 ) &lt; 1, it follows <ref> [8] </ref> that we have at least one such solution. Since at each time in the atom ff we have a regeneration by definition, the time T = ff + 1 is a regeneration time. <p> It might seem appropriate, in fact, to calculate the bounds on the ergodic averages using entirely an approach that ignored the geometric rates of convergence, since for example we know <ref> [8, Chapter 11] </ref> that if we have solutions to the (non-geometric) Foster-Lyapunov drift condition P V 0 V 0 1 + b1l C then this gives bounds of the form E x [t C ] V 0 (x); x 2 C c : However, in order that we also have finiteness <p> (non-geometric) Foster-Lyapunov drift condition P V 0 V 0 1 + b1l C then this gives bounds of the form E x [t C ] V 0 (x); x 2 C c : However, in order that we also have finiteness of E [t C ] it is shown in <ref> [8, Chapter 13] </ref> that one needs finite second moments on t C , and although conditions to ensure this are known [13], the finite moment generating functions given by (9) certainly are one way of approaching this problem for most practical situations. 4 Shift coupling bounds 12 Example 1: Reflecting Random

We shall find a bound which we show in Section 3 is strictly better than either fi MT or fi Ros . <p> As is clear from the proof above, improvements are possible, for instance when R has positive mass in C. We note that Rosenthal states a result <ref> [12, Theorem 8] </ref> based on a similar construction to our Theorem 2.1, but which contains an error: he essentially claims that for fi small enough such that (1 ")G C (fi) &lt; 1, where G C (fi) = sup y2C E y [fi t C ], one should find H (fi) <p> The regeneration time is therefore essentially 9Z where Z is a geometric (1=2) random variable.
