Title: SYSTEM CALLS REVEALED  
Author: by John R.Graham 
Abstract: This article is one in a series of four which will focus on some features of SunOS which are not so widely used or publicized. These features are all documented (at least to some degree) either in the header files or the AnswerBook, but the actual benefit of these features are not necessarily apparent from the documentation. With each article, there will be presented a feature along with a sample program designed to take advantage of the feature. The intended audience for this series are programmers who are looking for the extra edge in their applications design. The purpose is to introduce a tool, and to also present code and situations where the tool may be useful. Most of the information presented in these articles can be found in much greater detail in my book "Solaris 2.x Internals and Architecture" available from McGraw-Hill in June, 1995. If you have comments on the code or suggestion feel free to email me at ccg@access.digex.net
