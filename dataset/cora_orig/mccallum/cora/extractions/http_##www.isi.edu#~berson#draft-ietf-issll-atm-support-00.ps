Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress." Abstract Integrated Services in the Internet is rapidly becoming a reality. Meanwhile, ATM technology is appearing in the marketplace. It is an important problem to integrate ATM networks into this emerging Integrated Services Internet. "Classical" IP over ATM[11, 8] is now widely deployed, effectively solving the problem of "best effort service" in internets with ATM links. A key remaining issue is to provide the Internet Integrated Services (IIS) model over internets with ATM links. This draft provides guidelines for using ATM VCs with QoS as part of an Integrated Services Internet.

Reference-contexts: For any pair of IP/ATM edge devices (i.e. hosts or routers), a single VC is created on demand and shared for all traffic between the two devices. A second part of the RSVP and IIS over ATM problem, IP multicast, is close to being solved with MARS <ref> [1] </ref>, the Multicast Address Resolution Server. The MARS server generalizes ATMARP by allowing an IP address to resolve into a list of native ATM addresses, rather than just a single address. There is work in progress on alternative IP over ATM models (e.g. <p> If there is no choice about the VC being torn down, the RSVP daemon must be notified, so a reservation failure message can be sent. Most of the previous discussion has been concerned with meshes of point-to-multipoint connections. An alternate approach is to use a MultiCast Server <ref> [1] </ref> (MCS). An MCS provides a relay node that forwards the multicast (e.g. PATH) messages.
Reference: [2] <author> Borden, M., Crawley, E., Krawczyk, J, Baker, F., and Berson, S., </author> <title> "Issues for RSVP and Integrated Services over ATM," Internet Draft. </title>
Reference-contexts: We have a prototype system using the limited heterogeneity model running at ISI and we are experimenting with it now. There are a number of other issues that are subjects of continuing research. These issues (and others) are covered in <ref> [2] </ref>, and are briefly repeated here. One key issue is how to translate an Internet Integrated Services (IIS) QoS to an ATM QoS. Fortunately, this issue seems to be getting easier as the IETF and ATM Forum QoS definitions are getting more similar as they evolve. <p> Current work in the ATM Forum and ITU promises additional advantages. A final issue is to keep current with changes in ATM, and to keep this document up-to-date. Some specific issues are covered in <ref> [2, 5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In order to provide guaranteed quality real-time traffic, new classes of service and new protocols are being introduced in the Internet [10, 4], while retaining the existing best effort service. Signalling for these new services is done by RSVP <ref> [3, 12] </ref>, the Resource ReSerVation Protocol. Due to extensive telephone company support, ATM is rapidly becoming an important link layer technology. <p> Section 5 describes alternatives for VCs used for RSVP signalling messages. Section 6 discusses some additional minor issues. Section 7 concludes the draft and describes continuing and future work. 2 RSVP [NOTE this section is RSVP specific] RSVP <ref> [3, 12] </ref> provides many important features for signalling in the Internet including receiver initiated reservations, "soft state" in routers, heterogeneous reservations within a multicast session, dynamic change of reservations, and multiple reservation styles or modes of sharing.

Reference-contexts: For real-time traffic such as voice and video, the current Internet has performed well only across unloaded networks. In order to provide guaranteed quality real-time traffic, new classes of service and new protocols are being introduced in the Internet <ref> [10, 4] </ref>, while retaining the existing best effort service. Signalling for these new services is done by RSVP [3, 12], the Resource ReSerVation Protocol. Due to extensive telephone company support, ATM is rapidly becoming an important link layer technology.

Reference: [6] <author> Herzog, S., </author> <title> "Building Blocks for Accounting and Access Control in RSVP," Internet Draft. </title>
Reference-contexts: Full heterogeneity is possible where a separate VC could be created for each distinct QoS for a multicast session. While we advocate the limited heterogeneity approach as in section 4.1, different service providers may choose alternate approaches. RSVP allows for local policy control <ref> [6] </ref> as well as admission control. Thus a user can request a reservation with a specific QoS and with a policy object that, for example, offers to pay for additional costs setting up a new VC.

Reference-contexts: The MARS server generalizes ATMARP by allowing an IP address to resolve into a list of native ATM addresses, rather than just a single address. There is work in progress on alternative IP over ATM models (e.g. NHRP <ref> [7] </ref>) but similar solutions to those described here for the classical model are still expected to apply. But further study is needed. A key remaining issue for IP over ATM is the integration of RSVP signalling and ATM signalling in support of the Internet Integrated Services (IIS) model.

Reference-contexts: Signalling for these new services is done by RSVP [3, 12], the Resource ReSerVation Protocol. Due to extensive telephone company support, ATM is rapidly becoming an important link layer technology. As this draft was being written, the current version of ATM signalling was UNI 3.1 <ref> [9] </ref>, and UNI 3.1 is expected to be predominant in the marketplace in the near term. However, a new version (UNI 4.0) is expected to be standardized soon, and this draft will be updated as appropriate.

Reference-contexts: It is only natural that RSVP and the Internet Integrated Services (IIS) model would like to utilize the QoS properties of any underlying link layer, and this draft concentrates on ATM. Classical IP over ATM <ref> [11] </ref> has solved part of this problem, supporting IP unicast traffic over ATM. Classical IP over ATM is based on a Logical IP Subnetwork (LIS), which is a separately administered IP subnetwork.
