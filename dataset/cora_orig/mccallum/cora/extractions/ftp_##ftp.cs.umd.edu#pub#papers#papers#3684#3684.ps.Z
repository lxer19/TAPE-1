Title: Regularization Algorithms Based on Total Least Squares  
Author: Per Christian Hansen Dianne P. O'Leary 
Abstract: Discretizations of inverse problems lead to systems of linear equations with a highly ill-conditioned coefficient matrix, and in order to compute stable solutions to these systems it is necessary to apply regularization methods. Classical regularization methods, such as Tikhonov's method or truncated SVD, are not designed for problems in which both the coefficient matrix and the right-hand side are known only approximately. For this reason, we develop TLS -based regularization methods that take this situation into account. Here, we survey two different approaches to incorporation of regularization, or stabilization, into the TLS setting. The two methods are similar in spirit to Tikhonov regularization and truncated SVD, respectively. We analyze the regularizing properties of the methods and demonstrate by numerical examples that in certain cases with large perturbations, these new methods are able to yield more accurate regularized solutions than those produced by the standard methods.

Reference-contexts: Since I changes more frequently than L in our approach, the next step is to reduce the submatrix L C to bidiagonal form ^ B by means of Givens rotations, along the same lines as in Elden's algorithm <ref> [1, Section 5.3.4] </ref>. <p> Our algorithm uses the Lanczos bidiagonalization process which computes approximations to the principal singular triplets of a matrix. Approximations to the ordinary TLS solution can thus be computed by applying the Lanczos bidiagonalization process to the matrix (A ; b), cf. <ref> [1, Section 7.6.5] </ref>. The Lanczos T-TLS algorithm proposed in [4] is based on Lanczos bidiagonalization of the matrix A rather than (A ; b).

Reference-contexts: Such ill-conditioned linear systems arise frequently in connection with discretizations of ill-posed problems, such as Fredholm integral equations of the first kind, and the term discrete ill-posed problem is sometimes used to characterize these systems. For more details about the underlying theory see, e.g., <ref> [2] </ref>, [3], [6], [8] and the references therein. Suffice it here to say that the gradual decay of the singular values of A is an intrinsic property of discretizations of many ill-posed problems.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we survey two such regularization methods in the TLS setting. One is analogous to the Tikhonov-regularized solution and the other to the truncated SVD, but both allow errors in the entries of A. These methods have been developed recently in <ref> [4] </ref> and [5]. We discuss the regularizing effects of these methods and illustrate by numerical examples that they can be superior to the classical regularization methods. 2 Regularized TLS The first TLS -based regularization method is based on the Tikhonov formulation (2). <p> The idea to apply the T-TLS method to discrete ill-posed problems where there is no particular gap in the singular value spectrum, and where some of the larger singular values may also be discarded, was proposed in <ref> [4] </ref>. The details of the T-TLS method are as follows. Let the SVD of (A ; b) be given by (A ; b) = U V T = i=1 i (15) and assume that k is the smallest nonzero singular value that we wish to retain in the T-TLS solution. <p> = 2 n+1 ;(18) showing that the solution norm kx k k 2 increases monotonically with k while the TLS residual norm k (A ; b) (A 0 ; b 0 )k F decreases monotonically with k. 3.1 The T-TLS Filter Factors (Standard Form) One of the key results in <ref> [4] </ref> is an expression for the T-TLS solution x k in terms of the SVD of A, rather than the SVD of (A ; b) as was previously the case. <p> The advantage of using the SVD of A is that it immediately yields the T-TLS filter factors and thus lets us quantify the regularizing properties of the T-TLS solution. We emphasize that the following theorem, whose proof can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>, holds generally, and not just for discrete ill-posed problems. Thus, it supplements Thm. 3.8 in [12]. Theorem 3.1. Assume that the singular values of A and (A ; b) are simple. <p> Approximations to the ordinary TLS solution can thus be computed by applying the Lanczos bidiagonalization process to the matrix (A ; b), cf. [1, Section 7.6.5]. The Lanczos T-TLS algorithm proposed in <ref> [4] </ref> is based on Lanczos bidiagonalization of the matrix A rather than (A ; b). <p> All computations were carried out in Matlab using the Regularization Tools package [7]. More elaborate tests can be found in <ref> [4] </ref> and [5], where results from tests with the Lanczos T-TLS algorithm can also be found. It is a generally accepted fact that for small noise levels, we should not expect the ordinary TLS solution to differ much from the ordinary least squares solution; see [11]. <p> It is a generally accepted fact that for small noise levels, we should not expect the ordinary TLS solution to differ much from the ordinary least squares solution; see [11]. The same observations are made in <ref> [4] </ref> and [5] for the TLS -based regularized solutions, and the numerical results presented below also support this observation. <p> I I n in (7) introduces a non-constant component in the right part of the plot of the regularized solution, and it is precisely this component that improves the R-TLS error, compared to the Tikhonov error. 4.2 Illustration of the T-TLS Algorithm For the T-TLS method, it was found in <ref> [4] </ref> that the T-TLS solutions are superior to the other regularized solutions only when the T-TLS solution has large SVD components corresponding to the smallest retained singular values in the solution. To illustrate this, we use an "artificially generated" test problem similar to the one used in [4]. <p> was found in <ref> [4] </ref> that the T-TLS solutions are superior to the other regularized solutions only when the T-TLS solution has large SVD components corresponding to the smallest retained singular values in the solution. To illustrate this, we use an "artificially generated" test problem similar to the one used in [4]. The matrix A is 32 fi 32 and comes from discretization of Phillip's test problem (cf. phillips in [7]) with kernel K (s; t) = 1 + cos ((s t)=3) ; js tj &lt; 3 by means of the Galerkin method with orthonormal basis functions. <p> As the noise level increases, the minimum T-TLS errors become smaller than those of the TSVD method. Histograms showing the results of many similar experiments can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>, supporting the conclusion that T-TLS is superior to TSVD, as well as Tikhonov's method, whenever the noise level is large and the solution has large SVD components corresponding to the smallest retained singular values. 5 Conclusion We have presented two different approaches to incorporation of regularization, or stabilization, into the

Statistical aspects of a negative regularization parameter in Tikhonov's method are discussed in <ref> [9] </ref>. 4 Hansen et al. For a given ffi, there are usually several pairs of parameters I and L , and thus several solutions x, that satisfy relations (7)-(9), but only one of these satisfies the optimization problem (5).

Reference-contexts: Our algorithm reduces to the LSQR algorithm <ref> [10] </ref> if we require B 0;k = B k in each step. In each Lanczos step we can now compute an approximate T-TLS solution by applying the ordinary TLS algorithm to the small-size problem in (23). <p> This can be done in O (k 2 ) operations by means of the PSVD algorithm [13]. We remark that it is easy to augment the above algorithm to include the computations of the LSQR algorithm <ref> [10] </ref>. Approximate TSVD solutions can thus be computed together with the approximate T-TLS solutions with little overhead. 3.3 The General-Form Case In connection with the T-TLS and Lanczos T-TLS algorithms it may also be convenient to implicitly use regularization in general form with L 6= I.

Reference-contexts: In other words, replacing the LS residual with the TLS residual in the Tikhonov formulation has no effect when L = I n and ffi kx LS k 2 .
