Abstract: Yet, two classes of algorithms have been used in partial constraint satisfaction: local search methods and branch&bound search extended by the classical constraint-processing techniques like e.g. forward checking and backmarking. Both classes exhibit characteristic advantages and drawbacks. This article presents a novel approach for solving partial constraint satisfaction problems exhaustively that combines advantages of local search and extended branch&bound algorithms. This method relies on repair based search and a generic method for an exhaustive enumeration of repair steps.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Algorithms for solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) have been successfully applied to several fields including scheduling, design, and planning. Extending the standard CSP by a representation of constraint importance led to the class of partial constraint satisfaction problems (PCSP) <ref> [2] </ref> which provides new opportunities for solving several problems of combinatorial optimization more efficiently. A P CSP is the task of labeling each variable of a given variable set with a value of a certain domain. Constraints of an explicitly represented importance state restrictions on combinations of some variables' labels. <p> The solution of a P CSP is a labeling complying with as important constraints as possible. Yet, two classes of algorithms have been applied to partial constraint satisfaction: local search methods [9] and systematic branch&bound search extended by classical constraint-processing techniques like forward checking and backmark-ing <ref> [2, 4, 7] </ref>. Both paradigms exhibit characteristic advantages and drawbacks. Theoretically, the branch&bound algorithm is guaranteed to terminate with an optimal solution. However, tree search algorithms retract early decisions only after searching large portions of the search space exhaustively. <p> The well known algorithms for solving P CSP s like the branch&bound <ref> [2] </ref> as well as mincon [9] and mincon-walk [12] can be adopted easily to these definitions [6]. 3 Iterative Improvement Fig. 1 presents a scheme for searching by iterative improvement which forms the basis for our novel approach. <p> Exhaustive search: Table 1 presents empirical results on two variants of egr in comparison with the branch&bound algorithm bb+FC. Algorithm bb+FC uses forward checking equivalently to the P-FC3 procedure in <ref> [2] </ref> combined with a dynamic variable ordering heuristic, which is especially appropriate to constraint hierarchies [6, 7]. Forward checking results are used to assign best values first as value assignment strategy. Both egr procedures, egr+FC and egr+MACall, deploy bb+FC within the improvement step.

Reference-contexts: Proving the optimality of a result is not possible by use of local search algorithms. Local minima are processed by heuristics which either make use of noise strategies (mincon-walk and mincon-retry [12]), exploit information on the search history (e.g., tabu search <ref> [3] </ref>), or change more than one variable at each step of repair (e.g., EFLOP-heuristics [13] or the lc-algorithm [11]). This paper presents a novel approach for solving partial constraint satisfaction problems that combines the advantages of local search and tree search algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The constraint graph of the problem, the domains of the variables 2 , the current labeling, and the set of violated constraints are useful parameters of this procedure. In practical applications of such algorithms, e.g., in our commercial nurse scheduling system <ref> [8, 5] </ref>, choose-bad-region is tailored to the current application. In contrast, this paper introduces a generic algorithm for this procedure. <p> This algorithm | enhanced by an heuristic choose-bad-region procedure | does a pretty good job, e.g. on nurse scheduling problems, where mincon-walk as well as EFLOP-like heuristics failed at producing solutions of sufficient quality <ref> [8, 5] </ref>. Nevertheless, applying heuristics to the selection of bad regions in partial solutions of a PCSP exhibits some remarkable drawbacks.

Additionally, !(c) assigns a real number as a constraint weight to each constraint c. <p> Otherwise, the next hierarchy level is concerned. Hierarchy levels may be considered as a categorical degree of a constraint's importance whereas the weight is a gradual measure of importance. HCSPs turned out to be useful for representing real world problems <ref> [8, 5] </ref> and, additionally, enable the use of certain looking ahead techniques and dynamic variable orderings (DVO) [6, 7]. As usual, constraint problems are classified according to the number of variables, constraint density (den.) and the constraint's satisfiability (sat.).
