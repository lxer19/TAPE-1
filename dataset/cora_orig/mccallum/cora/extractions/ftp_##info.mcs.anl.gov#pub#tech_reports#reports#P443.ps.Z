Abstract: This paper presents our recent work on developing parallel algorithms and software for solving the global minimization problem for molecular conformation, especially protein folding. Global minimization problems are difficult to solve when the objective functions have many local minimizers, such as the energy functions for protein folding. In our approach, to avoid directly minimizing a "difficult" function, a special integral transformation is introduced to transform the function into a class of gradually deformed, but "smoother" or "easier" functions. An optimization procedure is then applied to the new functions successively, to trace their solutions back to the original function. The method can be applied to a large class of nonlinear partially separable functions including energy functions for molecular conformation and protein folding. Mathematical theory for the method, as a special continuation approach to global optimization, is established. Algorithms with different solution tracing strategies are developed. Different levels of parallelism are exploited for the implementation of the algorithms on massively parallel architectures.

Reference-contexts: Under some circumstances, such a "path" exists as a smooth curve, and then tracing solutions simply implies following a smooth solution curve determined by a set of transformed functions. 10 A random search procedure is an example of a simple solution trac-ing method, for example, the simulated annealing random search <ref> [1] </ref>. This method is easy to implement, and especially robust in the sense that the random search procedure can be designed to converge asymptotically to a global minimizer. However, convergence depends on how thoroughly the search can be conducted.

Reference-contexts: This result opens another direction for the effective trace of the solution solve the initial value problem using standard numerical IVP-methods, for example, the predictor-corrector methods <ref> [2] </ref>. One simple example is to use an Euler-Newton method as shown in Figure 4. In this method, at each iteration, an Euler predictor is computed to start a Newton's local minimization procedure to find a solution on the curve.

The load also is well balanced: the number of trials is the same each processor. For more implementation details, readers are referred to <ref> [3] </ref>. The algorithm is tested with a set of small sizes of Lennard-Jones mi-crocluster conformation problems, which have been well studied, and widely used as model problems for molecular conformation.

The system transforms the objective function into a sequence of gradually deformed functions. There are three subsystems corresponding to three different solution-tracing procedures, namely, the global simulated annealing random search (GLOBAL), the Newton's local minimization method 19 (LOCAL), and the Euler-Newton predictor-corrector method (PC).

Reference-contexts: The method is relatively inexpensive and clearly more feasible for large-scale problems (e.g., the protein problems). In particular, it can take advantage of well-developed local optimization techniques <ref> [6] </ref>. The effectiveness of this method can be illustrated in the following simple experiment: Consider the function in (6), and suppose that we wish to find its global minimizer. First we transform the function to obtain a class of new functions given in (7).

Reference-contexts: Another possible method is to apply local optimization procedures to each transformed function and trace a set of local minimizers. Our approach is called continuation-based, because the transformation can actually be viewed as a special continuation process by the theory described in <ref> [7] </ref>. Following this theory, our new approach can be studied in a general numerical continuation setting, and algorithms can be developed by employing standard advanced numerical methods. We will discuss these issues later in this paper. 3 Transformation We first introduce the transformation. <p> Then 8" &gt; 0, 9ffi / 1= for fixed , such that 8! with k!k &gt; ffi, j d &lt; f &gt; (!)j &lt; ": (11) Proof: See <ref> [7] </ref>. 2 From this theorem we learn that the relative size of d &lt; f &gt; (!) can be made arbitrarily small for all ! with k!k greater than a small value ffi. <p> Then the transformation (2) for f can be computed using the formula &lt; f &gt; (x) = i=1;j&gt;i 2 (kr ij k); (15) where r ij = x i x j and &lt; h ij &gt; p 2 h ij (kr 0 kr ij r 0 dr 0 Proof: See <ref> [7] </ref>. 2 Note that &lt; h ij &gt; p 2 (kr ij k) can be computed with a standard numerical integration technique; therefore, the transformation &lt; f &gt; (x) can be computed in this fashion. 6 Minimization In summary, we have introduced a parametrized integral transformation to transform the object function <p> To begin with the "right local minimizer," either a good initial point is provided based on the known knowledge of given problem, or a set of local minimizers can be selected and traced, and one of them may lead to a good solution. 11 8 Numerical Continuation Our recent work <ref> [7] </ref> shows that the parametrized integral transform in (2) defines for f a homotopy on [0; 0 ] for any 0 &lt; 1.
