Reference-contexts: Given a category C, we write j C j for the class of objects. The concept of Institution was introduced by Goguen and Burstall (see <ref> [1] </ref>) to formalize the abstract notion of "logical system".

Reference-contexts: It is, therefore, important to include it into a general frame, where powerful methods are available. This paper organizes order-sorted equational logic as an Institution. For all the necesary background from category theory and many-sorted algebra, the reader is referred to <ref> [2] </ref>. 2 Preliminaries In the following we will present the basic conventions and notations we are dealing with. Let S be a "sort set".
