Reference-contexts: To compute these, Bruss [3] uses a Least Mean Square approach to solve the desired parameters by minimizing the cost function E: E = r 2 where ~ o r are the measured optic flow vectors. To constrain the optic flow, Adiv <ref> [1] </ref> and Negahdaripour [6] model the scene locally as a planar patch. Since a planar patch is defined by a three parameter vector , we can write the formed optic flow field as o r = C (r; m; r) The least mean square approach described can again be applied. <p> error equals x F x (s p ) and the parameter vector is changed to minimize this error. ff 7 = t z y t y ; ff 8 = ! x y t z From this relation learning examples were generated by choosing random patch parameters (from the interval <ref> [1; 1] </ref>) and computing the Taylor coefficients ff 1 ; : : : ; ff 8 . Since the interval is symmetric, each of the dual solutions is equal likely.

Reference-contexts: If we model the corresponding optic flow field with a Taylor expansion, it can be shown that the Taylor expansion of the optic flow only contains non zero terms up to the second order <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> The relation of the Taylor coefficients with the parameters of the planar patch is then known and given by <ref> [2] </ref>: ff 1 = ! y t x ; ff 2 = t z x t x ff 5 = ! x t y ; ff 6 = ! z x t y space for a solution are almost identical.

Reference-contexts: The relative depth is known as the time to contact t r . This means that for N (N &gt; 4) flow vectors, five motion parameters ^ m = (t=ktk; !) and N relative scene depths can be computed from the optic flow. To compute these, Bruss <ref> [3] </ref> uses a Least Mean Square approach to solve the desired parameters by minimizing the cost function E: E = r 2 where ~ o r are the measured optic flow vectors. To constrain the optic flow, Adiv [1] and Negahdaripour [6] model the scene locally as a planar patch.

Reference-contexts: This means that standard function approximators like Multi Layer Perceptrons (mlp) are unable to approximate W 1 . In this paper we propose a solution to learning multi valued functions <ref> [4] </ref>. We will represent the mapping as a manifold 2 in the product space of input and output. In this way the twofoldness of the output solutions is captured into the parameterization of the manifold.

Reference-contexts: In this way the hidden nodes span the parameter space S, the mapping from the input layer to the hidden layer represents G and the mapping from the hidden layer to the output layer represents F. These networks are known as auto associative mlp <ref> [5] </ref> and shown in figure 2. 3 Implicitly we say that there is no unique parameterization of a manifold. v s ~v the middle layer, dimS, is lower then the dimension of the input and output layer, dimV, and represents the parameter space.
