Title: Solving Alignment using Elementary Linear Algebra

Affiliation: Cornell University  
Abstract: Data and computation alignment is an important part of compiling sequential programs to architectures with non-uniform memory access times. In this paper, we show that elementary matrix methods can be used to determine communication-free alignment of code and data. We also solve the problem of replicating read-only data to eliminate communication. Our matrix-based approach leads to algorithms which are simpler and faster than existing algorithms for the alignment problem.

Reference-contexts: However, they did not give a general method for solving these equations. Also, they did not handle replication of data. Recently, Anderson and Lam gave a solution method but their algorithm is quite complex, requiring the determination of cycles in bipartite graphs, computing pseudo-inverses etc. <ref> [AL93] </ref> | these complications are eliminated by our approach. Complementary to our work is the solution of the (NP-complete) problem of determining the best choice of constraints to leave unsatisfied in overconstrained systems of equations.

Reference-contexts: The null space problem can be solved through the use of integer-preserving Gaussian elimination of integer matrices, a standard tool in modern parallelizing compilers where it has found use in dependence analysis, loop transformations and code generation <ref> [Ban93, LP92] </ref>. One weakness of existing approaches to alignment is that they handle only linear functions; general affine functions, like the map of array Y , must be dealt with in ad hoc ways. In Section 3, we show that our framework permits affine functions to be handled without difficulty.

Reference-contexts: Heuristics for this problem were first discussed by Li and Chen [LC89] for a limited kind of alignment called axis alignment.

Incorporating such heuristics into our framework should give a clean and complete approach to alignment. To summarize, the contributions of this paper are the following. 1.

Reference-contexts: There are many ways to accomplish this, and we describe one such way. Suppose V 2 Z MfiN and rank (V) = r. Then by doing integer preserving Gaussian elimination with full pivoting <ref> [Edm67] </ref> we can establish the following factorization: HVP = R 11 R 12 where H is an M fi M invertible matrix representing the row operations, P is an N fi N unimodular matrix representing the column operations (which are permutations), R 11 is an r fir upper triangular invertible matrix. <p> Note that r is at most min (M; N ). A subtle point is that this complexity measure ignores the sizes of matrix entries during the elimination, but it is a well known result that the sizes of numbers involved grow polynomially at the worst <ref> [Edm67] </ref>. By exploiting the fact that the matrices arising in alignment are sparse and by reordering them so that symbolic constants are used late in the elimination, it may be possible to speed up this algorithm if necessary.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, a standard result in linear algebra states that such a basis can be obtained from a basis for the orthogonal complement of the range space of the matrix V, written as range (V) ? <ref> [GVL89] </ref>. The same reduction works in the case of multiple constraints. Suppose that there are s loops and t arrays.

Reference-contexts: In the first step, data references in the program are examined to determine a system of equations in which the unknowns are functions representing data and computation placements. Any solution to this system of equations determines a so-called communication-free alignment <ref> [HS91] </ref> | that is, a map of data elements and computations to virtual processors such that all data required by a processor to execute the iterations mapped to it are in its local memory. <p> actually worthwhile for this program | perhaps the sum can be done using a collective communication routine to get some benefit from parallel execution. in spirit to that of Huang and Sadayappan who were the first to formulate the problem of communication-free alignment in terms of systems of equational constraints <ref> [HS91] </ref>. However, they did not give a general method for solving these equations. Also, they did not handle replication of data.
