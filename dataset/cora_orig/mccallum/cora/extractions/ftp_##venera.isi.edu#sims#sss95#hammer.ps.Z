Abstract: The goal of the Tsimmis Project is to develop tools that facilitate the rapid integration of heterogeneous information sources that may include both structured and unstructured data. This paper gives an overview of the project, describing components that extract properties from unstructured objects, that translate information into a common object model, that combine information from several sources, and that allow browsing of information. A common problem facing many organizations today is that of multiple, disparate information sources and repositories, including databases, object stores, knowledge bases, file systems, digital libraries, information retrieval systems, and electronic mail systems. Decision makers often need information from multiple sources, but are unable to get and fuse the required information in a timely fashion due to the difficulties of accessing the different systems, and due to the fact that the information obtained can be inconsistent and contradictory. fl This work was supported by ARPA Contract F33615-93-1-1339, by the Anderson Faculty Scholar Fund, by the Center for Integrated Systems at Stan-ford University, and by equipment grants from Digital Equipment Corporation and IBM Corporation.

The goal of the Tsimmis 1 project is to provide tools for accessing, in an integrated fashion, multiple information sources. Numerous other recent projects have similar goals and are discussed briefly at the end of this abstract. For the following description of the Tsimmis architecture refer to Figure 1. For the Tsimmis project we have adopted a simple self-describing (or tagged ) object model in which objects have labels, types, values, and an (optional) identifier. Similar models have been in use for years; we call our version the Object Exchange Model, or OEM. OEM allows simple nesting of objects; a complete specification is given in [ Papakonstantinou et al., 1995 ] . All objects and their subobjects have labels that describe their meaning. For example, the following object represents a Fahrenheit temperature of 80 degrees: where the string "temp-in-Fahrenheit" is a human-readable label, the type "int" indicates an integer value, and "80" is the value itself. If we wish to represent a complex object, then each component of the object has its own label. For example, an htemp-in-Fahrenheit, int, 80i

Reference-contexts: We also have developed a query language, OEM-QL, for requesting OEM objects. OEM-QL adapts existing SQL-like languages for object-oriented models (e.g., [ Kifer et al., 1992, Kim and others, 1993, Korth and Roth, 1989, Roth et al., 1988 ] ) to OEM. Details and examples can be found in <ref> [ Papakonstantinou et al., 1995 ] </ref> . Note that many important information sources are completely unstructured, consisting of plain files or incoming bit strings (e.g., from a newswire). The Classifier/Extractor shown at the bottom of a file is an e-mail message and extract the sender, receiver, date, and contents.

Reference-contexts: The information collected by the Classifier/Extractor can then be exported via a translator to the rest of the Tsimmis system, together with the raw data. The Classifier/Extractor component is based on the Rufus system developed at the IBM Almaden Research Center <ref> [ Shoens et al., 1993 ] </ref> . Mediators Above the translators in Figure 1 lie the mediators. A mediator is a software module that refines in some way information from one or more sources [ Wiederhold, 1992 ] .

A mediator is a software module that refines in some way information from one or more sources <ref> [ Wiederhold, 1992 ] </ref> . A mediator embodies the knowledge that is necessary for processing a specific type of information. For example, a mediator for "current events" might know that relevant information sources are the AP Newswire and the New York Times database.
