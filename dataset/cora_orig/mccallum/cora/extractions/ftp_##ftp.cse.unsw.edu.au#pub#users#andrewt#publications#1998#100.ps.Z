Abstract: Various forms of non-monotonic reasoning thrive on minimal change in some form or other. In general, the principle of minimal change prescribes choosing the best from a given set of alternatives. A dual of this principle, which has not drawn much attention from the researchers in the field, is to reject the worst from a given set of alternatives instead. This paper explores the use of this principle in the context of belief revision, which has known connections with plausible reasoning. Apart from arguing that the suggested operation is not excessively weak, we provide a set of revision postulates that demonstrably characterises this non minimal belief revision operation.

Reference-contexts: Models are eliminated in a principled, systematic manner. The principle of minimal change (minimality principle) is one of the principles used to carry out such systematic model elimination. The minimality principle manifests in different forms in different approaches to reasoning. In the belief revision framework <ref> [Gar88, AGM85] </ref>, the reasoner, after receiving the evidence, entertains as serious possibilities only those models that are, among the models that satisfy the evidence, minimally different/distant from the set of currently flier_tweety nonflier_tweety nonbird_tweety bird_tweety entertained models as a whole.

Reference-contexts: In decision theoretic terms, our approach may be viewed as the maximization of safety within the bounds imposed by nonmonotonic reasoning. Our approach may be further motivated in light of findings in evolutionary game theory. Robert Axelrod's computer tournament among strategies for playing the iterated game of Prisoners' Dilemma <ref> [Axe84] </ref> shows that the strategy that pays off best in the long run is not the one that pays off best in a one-shot game. Tit for Tat, the strategy that beats all odds in this iterated game is almost a sure loser in a one-shot game.

It turns out that the AGM revision postulates characterise the Grove revision operation (see <ref> [Gro88] </ref> for Grove's systems of spheres approach; our presentation here is different but equivalent to it). We introduce the following notation for later use.

Reference-contexts: Most often one's preference gets more and more fine grained as one learns from the experience, and the experience comes with acting upon a rough and ready preference in the first place. This point may be illustrated by a concrete example from John Holland <ref> [Hol75, p. 10] </ref>, The problem [of adaptation] is like the problem of adjusting the height, vertical linearity, and vertical hold, controls on a television set.

Reference-contexts: In normality semantics <ref> [Sho88, KLM90] </ref>, on the other hand, all the models are graded in accordance with their (absolute) abnormality, and the reasoner, upon receiving some evidence, considers only those models that are minimally abnormal among those that satisfy the evidence.

Reference-contexts: We motivated this principle by appealing to the problem of iterated choice. Detail study of how our proposed approach deals with it is beyond the scope of this paper. In a sequel to this paper, however, we will replace AGM-expansion by abductive expansion <ref> [Pag96] </ref> and show, how, our account can handle iterated abductive belief expansion (and revision).

Reference-contexts: The best horror movie is not, in general, the best movie. This non-monotonicity of choice leads to the non-monotonicity of the non-monotonic inference relation j. In fact, minimality based belief change, viewed as a problem of choice, accords well with the established norms of rational choice theory (see <ref> [Rot96] </ref> for a thorough investigation of this problem).
