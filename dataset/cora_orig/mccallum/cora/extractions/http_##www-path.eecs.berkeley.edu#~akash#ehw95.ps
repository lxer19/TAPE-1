Reference-contexts: Significant amongst these are simulation tools for system-level ahs simulation, technical analysis tools for safety, highway productivity, comfort, environmental impact, and cost, and design tools for vehicle, highway, communication, driver interface, and other technologies. We present a framework in which these tool needs can be discussed (see <ref> [1] </ref>). An ahs design consists of four specifications: vehicle design, infrastructure design, ahs operating rules, and design failure events. An ahs is designed for deployment in an environment specified in terms of benchmark scenarios.

Reference-contexts: ability to account for physical system usage and charge the users according to pricing policies; Access and Security Management| the ability to specify and control users' access to the physical system in a multi-user operating environment; 6 These functions are based on the osi nm/Forum functional categories for network management <ref> [2] </ref>. 10 Resource Management| the ability to provide an inventory of all physical system resources and to administer their maintenance schedules; Planning Management| the ability to specify, simulate, and evaluate alternative physical system configurations and control policies. 3.2 The OMS Object Model The oms object model is derived from two streams

Reference-contexts: In section 4 we present a summary and indicate opportunities for collaboration in the ahs tool development efforts. 1.1 The PATH AHS Architecture The path Program at UC-Berkeley has proposed a hierarchical control architecture that yields up to a four-fold increase in transportation capacity while enhancing safety <ref> [4, 3] </ref>. The architecture proposes a strategy of platooning several vehicles as they travel along the highway. The separation of vehicles within a platoon is small (2m) while separation of platoons from each other is large (60m).

Reference-contexts: Data and processing distribution is based on zones. The SmartPath oms is obtained when the path ahs architecture described above is implemented in Smartahs <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. SmartPath consists of specialized objects and their behaviors given in terms of dynamical system models such as differential equations, finite state machines, fluid flows, and queuing networks, and it also specifies sensors, actuators, transmitters, receivers, control and communication policies, and operating rules.

Reference-contexts: Such a combination can be used to realize distributed and hierarchical system architectures. For example, we use a hierarchy of three oms to implement time- and event-driven scheduling (see <ref> [7] </ref>). 3.3 Smartdb, Smartahs, SmartPath Smartdb is a software implementation of the oms Object Model.
