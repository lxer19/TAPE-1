Title: Silicon Auditory Processors as Computer Peripherals  
Author: John Lazzaro John Wawrzynek M. Mahowald Massimo Sivilotti Dave Gillespie 
Abstract: Several research groups are implementing analog integrated circuit models of biological auditory processing. The outputs of these circuit models have taken several forms, including video format for monitor display [1,2], simple scanned output for oscilloscope display [3], and parallel analog outputs suitable for data-acquisition systems [4]. In this paper, we describe an alternative output method for silicon auditory models, suitable for direct interface to digital computers. As a prototype of this method, we describe an integrated circuit model of temporal adaptation in the auditory nerve, that functions as a peripheral to a workstation running the Unix operating system. We show data from a working hybrid system that includes the auditory model, a digital interface, and asynchronous software; this system produces a real-time X-Windows display of the response of the auditory nerve model.

Reference-contexts: We fabricated the auditory nerve chip design through MOSIS, using the Orbit 2 double-poly low-noise analog process; the chip dimensions are 2220m by 2250m. Figure 3 shows a block diagram of the chip, that models the auditory nerve representation. The analog input signal connects to a silicon cochlea <ref> [10] </ref>, shown on the far left of the diagram, that has 30 output taps. Each output tap includes circuits that model inner-hair-cell transduction [12]. Each tap connects to five spiking neuron circuits, shown as a row of boxes, that form the silicon auditory nerve representation.

Reference-contexts: Each output tap includes circuits that model inner-hair-cell transduction [12]. Each tap connects to five spiking neuron circuits, shown as a row of boxes, that form the silicon auditory nerve representation. The spiking neuron circuits model the temporal adaptation of the auditory nerve <ref> [14] </ref>. These 150 spiking neurons, arranged in a 30 by 5 array, are the output units of the chip; the event-address protocol communicates the activity of these units off chip. The temporal adaptation of these units acts as energy-efficient coding, and reduces the mean spike rate of the output array. <p> When A c is released, the system is ready to communicate a new event. implementation, each output unit is a two-stage low-power axon circuit [19]. The first axonal stage receives the cochlear input, and models the short-term adaptation of the auditory nerve <ref> [14] </ref>; this axon stage is not shown in Figure 4 (c). The first stage couples into the second stage, shown in Figure 4 (c), via the S and F wires. To understand the operation of this circuit, we consider the transmission of a single spike.

Reference-contexts: In comparison to other areas of the brain, biological auditory representations require extraordinary timing accuracy of individual pulses. One secondary neural representation uses the auditory nerve representation in computations that require 70 s timing accuracy <ref> [18] </ref>. Using this accuracy requirement, we can calculate the worst-case performance requirements of an event-list communications system. Using standard signalling conventions in a 2 CMOS technology, a parallel bus can communicate the binary encoding of a single spiking event in 50ns.
