Reference-contexts: This is developed in Huerta (1998), and Huerta and West (1997a,b), which include a range of examples in component assessment, prediction and spectral analysis. Our work here provides a very different approach to prior modelling and model uncertainty than other recent approaches <ref> (e.g., Barnett et al 1996) </ref> in AR models.

Reference-contexts: MCMC methods for model implementation are obviously quite fundamental to this field. In addition to building on and adapting general simulation methods from the growing toolboxes available to Bayesians, methods more specific to time series structures are critical in delivering tried, tested and efficient algorithms <ref> (e.g., Carter and Kohn 1994, de Jong and Shephard 1995) </ref>. One key area of current research interest is focussed on adapting simulation methods to a sequential analysis context.

Reference-contexts: We note further that, though our focus on component structure and assessment of latent processes is novel, others have explored inference on autoregressive root structure under more standard prior distributions <ref> (e.g., Geweke, 1988,89) </ref>. Finally, though not pursued here, the focus on component structure of state space models has also generated a quite novel theory of continuous time state space models (Huerta 1998), to be reported in the near future.

Reference-contexts: Finally, though not pursued here, the focus on component structure of state space models has also generated a quite novel theory of continuous time state space models <ref> (Huerta 1998) </ref>, to be reported in the near future. This has been important, for example, in analysis of geological time series which can have very erratic spacings, and small numbers of very long gaps between consecutive observations.

Reference-contexts: The data in the first frame is a section of an EEG trace from one of 19 channels at different scalp locations on a patient in seizure. Analysis of EEG data using time-varying au-toregressions has a history, with notable contributions in the work of Will Gersch and coauthors <ref> (see references in Kitagawa and Gersch 1996) </ref>, and our developments of latent factor decompositions complement and extend such prior work in this applied field. The model assumes d = 12 and time variation is modelled using standard discount factor methods. <p> Future development of time-varying vector models is therefore suggested, and this link-up is also natural in view of existing studies of EEG and related series with vector autoregressions <ref> (Kitagawa and Gersch 1996) </ref>, which may now be extended in practically important ways based on this novel perspective on latent components. Future applied work here will exploit this theory. 4.

Reference-contexts: The nature of changes over time in the structure of the evident time-varying periodicities in the data, induced by the forcing earth-orbital periodicities, are of interest in connection, particularly, with the changing nature of the so-called ~ 100kyr ice-age cycle <ref> (Park and Maasch 1993) </ref>. <p> Prior to that point, the ice-age cycle had lesser amplitude; characterising the timing of this switch-over is of current geological interest in connection with whether or not the increased significance of this cycle was gradual, or the result of abrupt and significant structural climatic change <ref> (Park and Maasch 1993) </ref>. Our analysis does not model change points per se, of course, and this initial study suggests that an elaboration to include the possibility of abrupt changes in the AR parameters would be of interest to help resolve this issue.

Exploring Related Univariate Decompositions A range of recent applied studies has been generated in the area of EEG analysis <ref> (Prado and West 1997, West, Prado and Krystal 1997) </ref>. In treatment of human subjects with critical neuropsychiatric disorders, such as major depression, electroconvulsive (ECT) therapy is among the most effective clinical treatments (Weiner and Krystal 1993). <p> The issues of parametrisation and identification are key, raising questions about appropriate structuring and parametrisation of the x t process model, and of strict parametric constraints on the B t matrices. The framework is intriguing but the research agenda only just entered <ref> (Prado and West 1997) </ref>. Theoretical progress has been made in exploring and extending the time series decomposition results discussed earlier to multivariate settings. The results are perhaps surprisingly complete theoretically, though they have yet to be explored and exploited in practice.

Reference-contexts: However, we are free to specify these distributions, and may make them conditional on past state vectors s for s &lt; t: Similarly, the G t sequence may be functionally dependent on past state vectors, which means that the framework allows essentially arbitrary state-dependent models <ref> (Priestley 1980) </ref>, and hence arbitrary non-linear structures (Tong 1990). Perhaps surprisingly, the decomposition results arise in such cases too. Hence, though these sections appear restricted to time-varying linear models, the generality is notable and indicative of potential for future work with latent structure in state-dependent, non-linear time series.

Reference-contexts: This is a series of 540 monthly measurements (during 1950-1995) of the difference of the departure from the long-term monthly mean sea level pressures at Tahiti in the South Pacific and Darwin in Northern Australia <ref> (Trenberth and Hoar 1996) </ref> known as the El Ni ~ no southern oscillation series. The series, in the upper frame of Figure 1, oscillates about zero and the predominance of negative values in more recent years is related to a recent warming in the tropical Pacific.

Reference-contexts: In treatment of human subjects with critical neuropsychiatric disorders, such as major depression, electroconvulsive (ECT) therapy is among the most effective clinical treatments <ref> (Weiner and Krystal 1993) </ref>. In ECT a brain seizure is evoked, inducing major increases in amplitudes and frequencies of electrical potential fluctuations measuring neural communications. Effective seizures are characterised by longer lasting, high amplitude fluctuations, and clinical psychiatrists investigate treatment effects by exploring differing patterns of seizure stimulus.

Reference-contexts: other things, the very practical focus on component structure leads to new classes of smoothness priors on the j coefficients, permits models of possibly very high order, trivially concentrates on the AR stationary region or its boundaries, and allows unit roots to model persistent low frequency trends and sustained periodicities <ref> (related to alternative approaches in West 1995 and 1996) </ref>. This latter feature helps to resolve difficulties in inference on spikes in spectral densities in using AR models (Huerta and West 1997b) that arise in standard approaches where unit roots are disallowed.

In cases where the identified latent processes z t;j have physical interpretation, the changes over time in their frequencies ff t;j and modulii r t;j (both now indexed by t as they are time-varying) are often of primary interest. <p> The vertical line in the period graph indicates the point at which the relative amplitudes of the first two components switched. 3. LATENT STRUCTURES IN MULTIPLE TIME SERIES 3.1. Exploring Related Univariate Decompositions A range of recent applied studies has been generated in the area of EEG analysis <ref> (Prado and West 1997, West, Prado and Krystal 1997) </ref>. In treatment of human subjects with critical neuropsychiatric disorders, such as major depression, electroconvulsive (ECT) therapy is among the most effective clinical treatments (Weiner and Krystal 1993). <p> The issues of parametrisation and identification are key, raising questions about appropriate structuring and parametrisation of the x t process model, and of strict parametric constraints on the B t matrices. The framework is intriguing but the research agenda only just entered <ref> (Prado and West 1997) </ref>. Theoretical progress has been made in exploring and extending the time series decomposition results discussed earlier to multivariate settings. The results are perhaps surprisingly complete theoretically, though they have yet to be explored and exploited in practice.
