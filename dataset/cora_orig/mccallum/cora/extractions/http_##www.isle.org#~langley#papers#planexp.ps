Reference-contexts: The simplest measure involves the total CPU time, but this metric can depend on both machines and implementations. More appropriate measures include the number of nodes considered in a search tree (Minton, 1990; Mooney, 1989), the number of unifications required <ref> (Allen & Langley, 1990) </ref>, and the number of subgoals generated during the planning process (Jones, 1989).

Reference-contexts: In the natural sciences, one can never control all possible variables. As a result, 3 One can also view resource limitations (e.g., time or energy) as independent variables that affect task difficulty. Experimental studies of `anytime' algorithms <ref> (Dean & Boddy, 1988) </ref> might examine the effect of planning time on quality of the resulting plans. researchers must collect multiple observations for each cell in their experimental design, average the resulting values, and use statistical techniques to ensure that conclusions about differences between cells are justified by the data.

Reference-contexts: More appropriate measures include the number of nodes considered in a search tree (Minton, 1990; Mooney, 1989), the number of unifications required (Allen & Langley, 1990), and the number of subgoals generated during the planning process <ref> (Jones, 1989) </ref>. Of course, such internal measures are less interesting for intelligent agents that interact with an external environment; in such cases, measures of overall external time for planning and execution become relevant, despite possible differences in hardware. <p> For example, some planning systems (Wilkins, 1988) incorporate constraints that may narrow the search or improve solution quality, but the influence of these constraints on behavior is an empirical question. Similarly, case-based planning systems draw upon a library of plans (Ham-mond, 1989) or plan components <ref> (Jones, 1989) </ref> in the construction of new plans, and one can determine the change in behavior as one adds or removes cases from memory. One special case of lesion studies focuses on learning, and much of the recent experimental work on planning falls into this area.

Reference-contexts: The above components focus on processes, but one can also imagine lesioning knowledge from a system. For example, some planning systems <ref> (Wilkins, 1988) </ref> incorporate constraints that may narrow the search or improve solution quality, but the influence of these constraints on behavior is an empirical question.
