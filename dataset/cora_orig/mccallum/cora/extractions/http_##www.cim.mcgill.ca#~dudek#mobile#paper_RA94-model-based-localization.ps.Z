Reference-contexts: Each segment can be thought of as representing a section of a wall or other obstacle although, in fact, some linear collections of observations may not correspond directly to existing structures. Line segment models for sonar use are appropriate given the characteristics of simple threshold-based sonar sensing <ref> [1, 3, 4] </ref>, where even a small object will produce a collection of measurements at similar distances that are nearly linear in structure. (In fact, the measurements from a single position are often arranged in the form of circular arcs of low curvature [7].

The voting stage consists of computing a vector difference between each point and its target model and deriving a weighted sum of these correction vectors to give an estimate of the robot's true position.

This technique divides measurements into unconnected subsets which are considered for independent modeling. <p> Taking both of these considerations into account allows a decision to be made regarding the splitting of clusters <ref> [4] </ref>. This process of selecting the minimum number of sufficiently good lines is related to minimal length encoding. moving the robot around a square obstacle in the cen-tre of a partially enclosed area (roughly 4 square meters) along the indicated trajectory.

Reference-contexts: Imperfect estimates of orientation, distance and velocity must be integrated over time and hence errors in absolute pose (position and orientation <ref> [5] </ref>) accumulate disastrously with successive motions and make the general problem of maintaining an accurate absolute coordinate system very difficult. For these reasons, map construction and long-term localization are dependent on the use of sensory data for recalibrating a robot's sense of its own location within the environment.

For noisy data these can be well approximated by line segments with much less computational overhead than circular models. <p> Movement along the axis of the hallway gives no displacement information since all parts of the walls look identical, and therefore cannot be distinguished in order to calculate a displacement. In practice, Kalman filtering can be used in such situations to combine dead-reckoning information with sensory input <ref> [7] </ref>. 3.1.2 Weighted Voting of Correction Vectors The individual correction vectors cannot be simply summed together to form an overall error vector - some kind of weighting is required.

Reference-contexts: While this is not necessary to perform the localization in this paper, it does allow for dynamic map keeping by keeping track of particular targets that may disappear or new ones that may appear <ref> [8] </ref>. This is useful for environments that change periodically, and could easily be adapted into the system described in this paper (since it would be independent of localization).

Reference-contexts: This problem which manifests itself in this context as the long hallway effect, is analogous to the aperture problem in motion estimation <ref> [9] </ref>. Observation of position (or motion) of a section of a straight line provides information only in the direction of the normal to the line (akin to normal flow in motion estimation).

Reference-contexts: After all line segments have been fit, any that are close together and co-linear are merged into a larger single line. The coordinate-system independent line fitting algorithm is based on a least mean squares fit using the singular values (eigenvectors) of the covariance matrix of the data <ref> [10] </ref>. This is analogous to fitting an ellipse to the data and finding the major and minor axes which are, respectively, the directions of maximum and minimum variance. <p> There are two criteria for this decision. First, if the fit ellipse is very elongated (where elongation is simply the ratio of eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the data <ref> [10] </ref>), then the cluster is line-shaped and we do not wish to split it. Secondly, an extremely long line segment may still have a significant orthogonal variance.
