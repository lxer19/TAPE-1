Reference: [Anv] <author> Peter Anvin. </author> <title> Linux device list. A list of major and minor device numbers for Linux devices. Now included in the kernel sources. </title>
Reference-contexts: See the termcap, curs_termcap, and terminfo manual pages for more information. 3.3. The /usr filesystem 20 3.2.2 The /dev directory The /dev directory contains the special device tles for all the devices. The device tles are named using special conventions; these are described in the Device list (see <ref> [Anv] </ref>). The device tles are created during installation, and later with the /dev/MAKEDEV script. <p> There can (usually) be only two or four IDE hard disks. These are known as /dev/hda, /dev/hdb, /dev/hdc, and /dev/hdd, respectively. SCSI hard disks are known as /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, and so on. Similar naming conventions exist for other hard disk types; see <ref> [Anv] </ref> for more information. Note that the device tles for the hard disks give access to the entire disk, with no regard to partitions (which will be discussed below), and it's easy to mess up the partitions or the data in them if you aren't careful. <p> For more information on the naming conventions for the oppy devices, see <ref> [Anv] </ref>. The names for oppy drives are complex, however, and Linux therefore has a special oppy device type that automatically detects the type of the disk in the drive. <p> There are several ways to connect a CD-ROM drive to the computer: via SCSI, via a sound card, or via EIDE. The hardware hacking needed to do this is outside the scope of this book, but the type of connection decides the device tle. See <ref> [Anv] </ref> for enlightment. 4.5 Tapes A tape drive uses a tape, similar 5 to cassettes used for music. A tape is serial in nature, which means that in order to get to any given part of it, you trst have to go through all the parts in between. <p> For example, /dev/hda1 is the trst primary partition on the trst IDE hard disk, and /dev/sdb7 is the third extended partition on the second SCSI hard disk. The device list in <ref> [Anv] </ref> gives more information. 4.8 Filesystems 4.8.1 What are tlesystems? A tlesystem is the methods and data structures that an operating system uses to keep track of tles on a disk or partition; that is, the way the tles are organized on the disk.

Reference-contexts: If you aren't using NFS, you can let your account creation tool pick them automatically. If you are using NFS, you'll have to be invent a mechanism for synchronizing account information. One alternative is to the NIS system (see <ref> [Kir] </ref>).
Reference: [Qui95] <author> Daniel Quinlan. Linux Filesystem StructureRelease 1.2, </author> <month> March </month> <year> 1995. </year> <title> A description of and a proposal for a standard Linux directory tree, with the intention is to make it easier to package software and administer Linux systems by making tles appear in standard places. Follows fairly closely traditional Unix practice, and has got support from most Linux distributions. </title> <note> Available via FTP from ftp.funet.fi, directory /pub/Linux/doc/fsstnd. </note>
Reference-contexts: Some alternative ways of splitting are also described. 3.1 Background This chapter is loosely based on the Linux tlesystem standard, FSSTND, version 1.2 (see the bibliography, <ref> [Qui95] </ref>), which attempts to set a standard for how the directory tree in a Linux system is organized. Such a standard has the advantage that it will be easier to write or port software for Linux, and to administer Linux machines, since everything will be in their usual places.

Reference-contexts: Ext2 eectively always allocates the free block that is nearest to other blocks in a tle. For ext2, it is therefore seldom necessary to worry about fragmentation. There is a program for defragmenting an ext2 tlesystem, see <ref> [TV] </ref> in the bibliography. 4.8. Filesystems 50 There are many MS-DOS defragmentation programs that move blocks around in the tlesystem to remove fragmentation. For other tlesystems, defragmentation must be done by backing up the tlesystem, re-creating it, and restoring the tles from backups.
