Abstract: The design of a 32-bit PowerPC Fixed Point Unit is proposed. The 1GHz single chip CGaAs FXU contains on chip split L1 instruction and data caches, instruction stream buffers, a pipeline, and a two bit dynamic branch predictor. The PowerPC ISA uses instruction formats that place the register source identifiers in three different locations. In order to make the register file accessible in a single clock cycle only two read ports will be available. The sources must be decoded from the instruction word before the register file access may begin, potentially adding an extra stage to the pipeline. By implementing the L1 i-cache as a decoded cache, the register source identifiers can be pre-decoded, and this stage can be eliminated from the pipeline. The pipeline consists of nine stages, one for program counter selection, two for L1 i-cache accesses, three for alu setup and execution, two for L1 d-cache accesses, and one for register writeback. The pipeline allows results to be forwarded to the alu stage, and contains control necessary to restart the pipeline under a variety of conditions. Cases of i-cache and d-cache misses that would normally produce stalls are simply restarted from the first stage of the pipeline in our microarchitecture, simplifying control logic and eliminating stall muxes from the critical paths in most stages of the pipeline. Due to the length of the pipeline branch prediction is necessary to achieve high performance. The branch prediction scheme consists of a two bit dynamic predictor and target address held in a branch prediction cache. Stream buffers will be architected between the small L1 instruction cache and the large L2 instruction cache, significantly reducing the instruction cache miss penalty. The FXU target clock frequency of 1GHz presents interesting design challenges. The final FXU chip should attain this high clock rate at the lowest possible power, and still achieve a high level of performance. In order to implement the complex PowerPC instruction set, the pipeline logic must be sub-divided beyond the classic 5 stage pipeline design. Opera

Reference-contexts: Most signals will be active high, so signals which are active low will be written with a _l extension. Signals which are the input or output to a latch must obey the two-phase clocking convention set forth in <ref> [Karplus84] </ref>. Table 4 summarizes the naming convention. (Labels V2, S2, and V2S1 are defined similarly.) Additionially, when wires that connect modules in the pipeline to latches will be labeled with the number corresponding to the stage.
