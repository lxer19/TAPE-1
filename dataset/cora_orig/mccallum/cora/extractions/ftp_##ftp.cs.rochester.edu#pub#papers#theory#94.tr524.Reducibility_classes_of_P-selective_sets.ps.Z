Title: Reducibility Classes of P-selective Sets  
Author: Lane A. Hemaspaandra Albrecht Hoene Mitsunori Ogihara 
Keyword: Key words: Complexity theory, semi-decision algorithms, membership testing, selector functions  
Note: July 18, 1994  
Abstract: A set is P-selective [Sel79] if there is a polynomial-time semi-decision algorithm for the set|an algorithm that given any two strings decides which is "more likely" to be in the set. This paper establishes a strict hierarchy among the various reductions and equivalences to P-selective sets.

Reference-contexts: We will use P-sel to denote the class of P-selective sets. The function f is said to be a selector (function) for A. Since its introduction by Selman [Sel79,Sel82a,Sel82b] as a complexity-theoretic analog to the semirecursive sets <ref> [Joc68] </ref> from recursive function theory, P-selectivity has attracted a good deal of interest, and there have recently been many advances in our understanding of this class [Tod91,HNOS93,NOS93,BvHT93,BTvEB93].

One of the more natural of these more general recognition notions is P-selectivity. Intuitively, a set is P-selective if there is a 2-ary polynomial-time function that chooses which of its inputs is "more likely" (or, actually, is "not less likely") to belong to the set.

Intuitively, a set is P-selective if there is a 2-ary polynomial-time function that chooses which of its inputs is "more likely" (or, actually, is "not less likely") to belong to the set. Definition 1 [Sel79] A set A is P-selective if there is a total polynomial-time function f so that, for every x; y 2 fl , 1. f (x; y) 2 fx; yg, and fl Some of these results appear in preliminary form in "Selectivity" (a 1993 ICCI Conference contribution; L.

It is not hard to see that this optimality follows as a consequence of a recent result of Watanabe (see part 5 of Theorem 1).
