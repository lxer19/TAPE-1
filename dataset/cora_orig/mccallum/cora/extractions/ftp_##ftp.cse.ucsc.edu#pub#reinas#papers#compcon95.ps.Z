Abstract: The Real-Time Environmental Information Network and Analysis System (REINAS) is a distributed system supporting the conduct of regional environmental science research at the desk top. Continuous real-time data acquired from dispersed sensors is stored in a logically integrated but physically distributed data base. An integrated problem-solving environment is under development which supports visualization and modeling. REINAS is intended to provide insight into historical, current, and predicted oceanographic and meteorological conditions. REINAS permits both collaborative and single-user scientific work in a distributed environment. Keywords: distributed data base, heterogeneous data base, real-time data base, temporal data base, scientific data base, geographical information system, environmental monitoring.

Developing data base schemata tracking the meta-data associated with a scientific enterprise or scientific discipline is an ongoing activity <ref> [3] </ref>. The REINAS model supports the oceanographic and meteorological communities and has broad environmental application. REINAS applies and extends many traditional computer science techniques. Distributed system techniques are applied in the areas of security, naming, and client-server application design [4, 14].
