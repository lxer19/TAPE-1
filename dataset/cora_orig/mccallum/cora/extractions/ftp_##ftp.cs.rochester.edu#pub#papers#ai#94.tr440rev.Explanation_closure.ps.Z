Abstract: Explanation closure (EC) axioms were previously introduced as a means of solving the frame problem. This paper provides a thorough demonstration of the power of EC combined with action closure (AC) for reasoning about dynamic worlds, by way of Sandewall's test suite of 12-or-so problems ([30], [31]). Sandewall's problems range from the "Yale turkey shoot" (and variants) to the "stuffy room" problem, and were intended as a test and challenge for nonmonotonic logics of action. The EC/AC-based solutions for the most part do not resort to nonmonotonic reasoning at all, yet yield the intuitively warranted inferences in a direct, transparent fashion. While there are good reasons for ultimately employing nonmonotonic or probabilistic logics - e.g., pervasive uncertainty and the qualification problem this does show that the scope of monotonic methods has been underestimated. Subsidiary purposes of the paper are to clarify the intuitive status of EC axioms in relation to action effect axioms; and to show how EC, previously formulated within the situation calculus, can be applied within the framework of a temporal logic similar to Sandewall's "discrete fluent logic", with some gains in clarity.

Reference-contexts: If we are simply being told a story, we can rely on the narrator to withhold nothing of relevance from us. The narrator will not neglect to mention that Joe unloaded the gun before pulling the trigger on Fred. As Amsterdam <ref> [1] </ref> argues, narrators are expected to tell their story in a way that puts the hearer/ reader on the scene (vicariously, through the narrator's perceptions), and this entails reporting everything of relevance that happened. To be sure, there are many qualifications to be made and subtleties to be explored here. <p> How could any reasonable logic have entailments defeasible by tautologies? This once again raises the important question of "what's in a problem statement". As noted earlier, Amsterdam <ref> [1] </ref> drew attention to the role of narrative conventions in story-like problem statements, in particular the requirement that the author relate everything his audience would have observed under the reported circumstances except perhaps events that transpired during explicitly reported lapses of attention (e.g., where the author indicates that some time passed, <p> EC: roughly speaking, changes that are provable effects of provable actions (according to some theory of what constitutes an "effect") definitely occurred, and no change occurred unless it is the effect of some A t , where A t or U A t is provable. (For the exact formulation, see <ref> [1] </ref>.) Amsterdam notes that his approach fails to allow for actions which people regard as "obvious" inferences from certain state changes. 7 His example is one where a character is sitting by the fireplace in one sentence and standing by the door in the next.

Reference-contexts: To my mind the most attractive approach to uncertain reasoning is one based on direct inference of epistemic probabilities (i.e., probabilities for particular propositions) from "statistical" generalizations (e.g., <ref> [2] </ref>, [3], [4], [18], [21]). The advantage of a probabilistic approach to nonmonotonicity is that it allows systematically for degrees of belief, and that it can provide a coherent basis for decision-making by an intelligent agent.

Reference-contexts: The problem is to avoid exhaustively enumerating all the resultant changes in describing the effects of an action, yet be able to infer those changes (as needed). Ginsberg <ref> [15] </ref>, for reasons I do not quite understand, cites the ramification problem as a difficulty for EC. As a matter of fact, a fairly elaborate "robot's world" example in Sch90 [section 3] was designed precisely to show how well EC works even in the presence of ramifications.

Reference-contexts: This complementarity extends to their use: effect axioms allow the inference of change, and EC axioms the inference of non-change (persistence). For instance, if I know that no-one has painted or wallpapered the wall, then I can conclude that its color has remained unaltered.

Reference-contexts: The intended conclusion is that at the end of firing, the turkey is either deaf and not alive, or nondeaf and alive. Sandewall points out that this problem confutes methods like Kautz's <ref> [20] </ref> which unconditionally prefer later changes to earlier ones (and so leave the turkey unhidden and hence deaf and doomed). In an EC-based approach, this variant is quite analogous to the RTS.

Reference-contexts: course, to the inertia adherents this simply indicates the need for a certain nimbleness in switching from one pretense to another shifting to a new coordinate frame, a new vocabulary of fluents and actions reflecting new criteria of relevance, and semantically, to a new make-believe world of inert objects (see <ref> [24] </ref>). So there is one frame for physical action within the confines of the office, another for coping with rush-hour traffic, another for maintaining the lawn, others for functioning as part of various social groups and organizations (teaching, administering, parenting, choir singing, etc.), and so on.

Reference-contexts: More importantly from the present perspective, the "blanket closure" 19 assumptions implemented through circumscription are too strong, for much the same reasons that closure of effects is in general too strong. (Interference is, after all, due to the effects of actions on each other.) Lin and Shoham <ref> [26] </ref> provide a third, and also closely related, preliminary proposal for allowing concurrency in SC. Their main concurrent combinator is written with set brackets, i.e., fAction 1 , ..., Action n g. Much as in the earlier attempts, a central concern is encoding noninterference between concurrent actions.

Reference-contexts: If in addition they understand computation, they may find the notion that the world is like a computer's internal store, modified only at the behest of the CPU, nearly irresistible (and indeed this analogy has been alluded to by the father of "commonsense inertia" - McCarthy <ref> [27] </ref>). I suspect that cab drivers, factory workers, weather reporters, stockbrokers, firemen or fishermen may have less affinity for such a metaphysics. In my own metaphysics only the laws that govern fluents are constant, not the fluents themselves.
