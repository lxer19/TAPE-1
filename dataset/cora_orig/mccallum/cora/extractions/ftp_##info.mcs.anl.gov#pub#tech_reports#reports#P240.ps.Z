Abstract: In domain decomposition algorithms with more than a few subdomains, there is a crucial need for a mechanism to provide for global communication of information at each step of the iterative process. The convergence rate will decay rapidly with an increasing number of subdomains if communication is only between neighboring subdomains. For iterative substructuring algorithms (those domain decomposition algorithms that use nonoverlapping subdomains), the method that provides for good global communication in two dimensions does not work well for problems in three dimensions. In this paper we present an alternative approach for providing global communication that works well in three dimensions. Sample theoretical and numerical results are presented. 1. Introduction. In this paper we will discuss an iterative substructuring algorithm designed explicitly for problems in three dimensions. Our algorithm has

The Problem. <p> Its energy is approximately R supp (u h 0 ) 1=H 2 H: Hence (C h 0 ) 2 H=h: To summarize, the problem in three dimensions is that interpolating the value of a finite element function from a single node can result in large changes in energy, see Smith <ref> [12] </ref>, [13] for a more technical explanation. Following an approach of Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz [3], we construct the new coarse space V h 0 in a way that avoids interpolating the value of finite element functions from a single node. <p> Finally, the values on the interior of the subdomain are obtained by extending the values from the faces and edges as discrete harmonic on the interior. This type of interpolation results in only small, O (1+log (H=h)); changes in the energy; see Smith <ref> [12] </ref>, [13]. On the subspace V h 0 we need an accurate, yet easily computed, approximation to the H 1 inner product. <p> The calculation of a projection onto the space V 0 in the b 0 (; ) inner product chiefly involves the solution of a sparse linear system with one unknown per subdomain; see Smith <ref> [12] </ref>. The techniques used in the construction of b 0 (; ) are similar to those used by Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz [3] and Mandel [10]. The main theoretical result obtained for this algorithm is given in Smith [12]. Theorem 3.1. <p> of a sparse linear system with one unknown per subdomain; see Smith <ref> [12] </ref>. The techniques used in the construction of b 0 (; ) are similar to those used by Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz [3] and Mandel [10]. The main theoretical result obtained for this algorithm is given in Smith [12]. Theorem 3.1. When exact interior solvers are used in the algorithm outlined above, the condition number of the resulting system can be bounded independently of the number of subdomains and the jumps in the coefficients of the differential equation between subdomains.
