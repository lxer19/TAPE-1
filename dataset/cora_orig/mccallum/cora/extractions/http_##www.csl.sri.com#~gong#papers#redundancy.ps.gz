Title: A Note on Redundancy in Encrypted Messages  
Author: Li Gong 
Date: June 1990

Abstract: In a cryptographic protocol, it is important for a recipient to determine that a message has not been modified during transmission. This is normally achieved by providing redundancy in the message. Typically, a message is described in the literature as containing enough redundancy, not enough redundancy, or no redundancy at all. This note shows that, because of the secrecy that comes with encryption, redundancy can be provided at two different levels. An example demonstrates that this distinction is useful in guarding against certain cryptographic attacks on weak keys.

Reference-contexts: This makes protocols that encrypt with weak keys such as user passwords vulnerable to a secret guessing attack, which is a simple case of a verifiable-text attack <ref> [Gong 90] </ref>. Clearly, the situation is not better if the checksum is produced with the same encryption key or a known variant of it. <p> does not issue weak (encryption or checksum) keys keys chosen from a relatively small space which can be rather easily guessed but also that strong keys cannot be determined by guessing some weak keys and examining the available information such as network packets to verify a correct or failed guess <ref> [Gong 90] </ref>. For example, in the proposed key management for enhancing privacy in the Internet electronic mail protocol [Kent 89], each communicating end point has the facility to maintain a strong secret such as the secret component of an RSA key pair.

Reference-contexts: For example, in the proposed key management for enhancing privacy in the Internet electronic mail protocol <ref> [Kent 89] </ref>, each communicating end point has the facility to maintain a strong secret such as the secret component of an RSA key pair. Therefore it only needs to ensure that the actual data encrypting keys are well chosen.

Reference-contexts: Now it is important to ensure that the combined key space, the Cartesian product of the encryption key space and the checksum key space, is large enough to prohibit guessing. Such a technique has been successful in protecting user passwords which are often badly chosen <ref> [Lomas 89] </ref>. In practice, checksums or similar methods are commonly used to guarantee message integrity; also, the formats of messages tend to be rigorous (e.g. [ANSI 86,Linn 89]). <p> However, since a user interface normally relies upon user passwords for security (e.g. [Steiner 88]) and average users cannot be trusted to remember strong secrets, a protocol suite should consider a protocol which employs weak keys to convey strong keys in a safe manner (e.g. <ref> [Lomas 89] </ref>). Moreover, since a message's structure or format is part of a protocol specification and is normally public knowledge, the use of redundant values is more attractive in providing implicit redundancy than the use of redundant structure.

Reference-contexts: In the following protocol, P generates two nonces n1 and n2, and sends them to Q in message 1. A nonce is a random number that has not been used before for the same purpose <ref> [Needham 78] </ref>. In message 2, Q transfers a secret to P . 1. P ! Q: fn1; n2; P; Qg K1 2.
