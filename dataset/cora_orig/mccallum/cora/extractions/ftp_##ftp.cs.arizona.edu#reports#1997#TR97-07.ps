Abstract: Rectangles from a list of length n are packed into a unit width strip. The rectangles have dimensions independently chosen from a uniform distribution on [ 0 , 1 ], and the packing objective is to minimize the expected height of the packing of n items. The packing algorithms of interest must operate on-line, as well as adhere to a constraint reminiscent of the Tetris game: rectangles arrive from the top and must be moved at arrival without overlap within the strip to reach their final placement. This paper assumes no rotation of rectangles. The Group Packing algorithm GP 3 packs rectangles densely in groups of 3 at a time, starting a new level at the highest point reached by any rectangle in the group. The GP 3 algorithm achieves an asymptotic expected height of ( 0. 38541...) n. This is slightly worse than the bound ( 0. 38134...) n achieved by Next Fit Level (NFL) packing.

Reference-contexts: The placement is fixed at that time and cannot be altered later. (2) The packing algorithm obeys Tetris-like constraint <ref> [AE96] </ref>: rectangles descend from the top of the strip, and must be moved within the strip horizontally and vertically to reach their final placement, and may not overlap the area of any other rectangle during this movement. In this paper, rotation of rectangles during placement is not allowed.

Reference-contexts: More information on on-line algorithms and Tetris-constrained algorithms can be found in [CDW97].

Packings possible by sliding the rectangles ``outside'' the strip boundaries are thus ruled out. See Figure 1 for an example.
