Reference-contexts: This work was supported by the U. S. Department of Energy under grant number DOE-DE-FG02-85ER25001 with additional support by I.B.M. through the C.S.R.D. Affiliates Program. 1 2.2 The Xylem Operating System The Xylem operating system is a modified version of Alliant's Concentrix operating system <ref> [1] </ref>. The Xylem operating system provides additional control and communication features to allow tasks on different clusters to operate together. Parallel processing is performed on Cedar by creating a parallel process called a Xylem process.

Reference-contexts: This section does not try to provide a detailed description of Cedar, Xylem, or the virtual memory system. A more detailed overview is provided in the CSRD introductory guide <ref> [6] </ref>. 2.1 The Cedar Architecture The Cedar architecture is a cluster-based approach, using a hierarchical memory system [2][7].
