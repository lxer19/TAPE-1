Abstract: Consider a tree T with a number of extra edges (the bridges) added. We consider the notion of diameter, that is obtained by admitting only paths p with the property that for every bridge b in path p, no edge that is on the unique path (in T ) between the endpoints of b is also in p or on the unique path between the two endpoints of any other bridge in p. (Such a path is called non-reversing.) We investigate the trade-off between the number of added bridges and the resulting diameter. Upper and lower bounds of the same order are obtained for all diameters of constant size. For the special case where T is a chain we also obtain matching upper and lower bounds for diameters of size ff(N ) + O(1) or of size f (N ) where f (N) grows faster than ff(N). Some applications are given.

Reference-contexts: Chazelle showed that the upper bounds shown by Yao for the chain can be achieved also in trees. Our paper is easier to read than those by Yao and Chazelle, and treats the case of constant diameter in more detail. Bonet and Buss <ref> [1] </ref> consider a related problem for a directed tree, namely, to efficiently generate a given set of edges in the transitive closure of the tree by combining tree edges.

Reference-contexts: In case the (dynamic) forest remains balanced (which can be guaranteed in some applications discussed by Tarjan) the ff function occurs in the complexity. In Tarjan's work, the trees are directed and dynamic. Yao [8] considered a problem similar to ours, but only for the case of chains. Chazelle <ref> [2] </ref> considered abstract generalizations of techniques for lists and intervals to trees and paths. The queries considered for a path are cumulative sums over edge weights, where the weight of an edge is taken from a semiring.

Reference-contexts: The natural question arises what diameter can be realized with a linear number of bridges. This subsection addresses this question briefly. It turns out that the M k differ only by a constant factor from the row inverses of the Ackermann function as defined by La Poutre <ref> [3] </ref>. It is shown in [3] that these functions satisfy M ff (N)+O (1) (N) = O (1), where ff is the function commonly known as the inverse Ackermann function. <p> This subsection addresses this question briefly.

Reference-contexts: The non-reversibility condition is necessary because the result of a relation composed with its reversed relation is in general not the identity relation. The problem for trees was addressed in this paper. The problem was suggested in <ref> [4] </ref> and some results (Theorems 2.1 and 3.3) are found in [5]. The general graph problem leads to the following generalisation of the problem. Given is a graph G = (V; E).

Reference-contexts: They show, using the same constructions as we do, that n edges can be constructed in an m-node tree in O ((n + m)ff (m)) steps. Observe that in all our constructions, each bridge can be obtained by combining two smaller bridges or tree edges. Thorup <ref> [7] </ref> considers the problem of reducing the diameter of directed graphs by adding edges of the transitive closure (bridges), in such a way that the number of edges is at most doubled. It is conjectured that a poly-logarithmic diameter can be achieved for all digraphs; [7] supports the conjecture by showing <p> Thorup <ref> [7] </ref> considers the problem of reducing the diameter of directed graphs by adding edges of the transitive closure (bridges), in such a way that the number of edges is at most doubled.
