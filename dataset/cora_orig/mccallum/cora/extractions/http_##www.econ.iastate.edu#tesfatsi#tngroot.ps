Abstract: This paper develops an evolutionary trade network game (TNG) that combines evolutionary game play with endogenous partner selection. Successive generations of resource-constrained buyers and sellers choose and refuse trade partners on the basis of continually updated expected payoffs. Trade partner selection takes place in accordance with a modified Gale-Shapley matching mechanism, and trades are implemented using trade strategies evolved via a standardly specified genetic algorithm. The trade partnerships resulting from the matching mechanism are shown to be core stable and Pareto optimal in each successive trade cycle. Nevertheless, computer experiments suggest that these static optimality properties may be inadequate measures of optimality from an evolutionary perspective.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, choice and refusal also permit opportunistic players to home in quickly on exploitable players and form parasitic relationships. The computer experiments reported in [20] and in the subsequent studies by Ashlock et al. <ref> [1] </ref>, Smucker et al. [19], and Hauk [8] indicate that the emergence of mutual cooperation in the standard evolutionary IPD is accelerated by the introduction of choice and refusal of partners. <p> When the DCR matching mechanism was then restored, the average fitness score achieved by the trade-bots typically evolved to the mutual cooperation level 1:4; see Fig. 2. These TNG experiments reinforce the previous IPD/CR findings of Stanley et al. [20] and Ashlock et al. <ref> [1] </ref> that a preference-based matching mechanism tends to accelerate the emergence of mutual cooperation in the IPD when each agent is permitted both to make and to refuse game offers, is unconstrained with regard to the number of received offers he can accept, and is permitted to have at most one

Reference-contexts: As will be clarified below, trade partners are determined in accordance with a deferred choice and refusal (DCR) mechanism, a modified Gale-Shapley matching mechanism <ref> [6] </ref> that retains the static optimality properties of the original Gale-Shapley mechanism. Expected payoffs are updated by means of a simple learning algorithm that yields consistent estimates. A trade is modelled as a prisoner's dilemma game, and trade (IPD) strategies are evolved by means of a standardly specified genetic algorithm. <p> The tradebots determine their submission, acceptance, and refusal of trade offers in each trade cycle using a modifed version of the well-known Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance mechanism <ref> [6] </ref>. This modified mechanism, hereafter referred to as the deferred choice and refusal (DCR) mechanism, is discussed more carefully in Section 3 below. <p> The degree to which accepted offers are satisfactorily fulfilled is determined by subsequent PD game play. 3 Determination of TNG Trade Partners The original Gale-Shapley matching mechanism <ref> [6] </ref> was designed for two-sided markets in which one subset of agents makes offers to a second disjoint subset of agents, with all offer quotas equal to 1. <p> Note that the trades determined in any trade cycle T by the DCR mechanism always constitute a matching outcome for trade cycle T in the sense of Definition 3.1. DEFINITION 3.2. (cf. Gale and Shapley <ref> [6, p. 10] </ref>) A matching outcome G for trade cycle T will be called unstable if the following conditions hold for some buyer m and seller n: (a) m and n are not matched under G; (b) m would prefer to be matched with n, in the sense that either there <p> The proof is a generalization of the optimality proof provided in Gale and Shapley <ref> [6, Thm. 2, p. 14] </ref> for their college admissions problem with B disjoint from S and offer quotas O m = 1 for all agents m in B; see also Roth and Sotomayor [18, Chapter 5].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Evolutionary game studies typically focus on the optimality properties of strategy configurations when agents are matched randomly or deterministically by some extraneous device. The optimality properties of the matching mechanism per se are generally not considered ([11], <ref> [14] </ref>). In contrast, optimal search studies focus on the optimality properties of preference-based agent matching mechanisms, but generally these studies are set in static contexts [18].

Briefly, the GA is applied to a population of bit strings that encode the trade strategies (FSMs) of the tradebots. The GA employs two-point crossover with bit mutation, and parent strategies are chosen probabilistically in proportion to fitness. <p> All experimental findings reported below were obtained using TNG , a C++ trade platform developed by McFadzean and Tesfatsion <ref> [16] </ref> which in turn is supported by the C++ abstract base classes developed by McFadzean [15] for a general artificial life platform, SimBioSys.

Reference-contexts: The optimality properties of the matching mechanism per se are generally not considered ([11], [14]). In contrast, optimal search studies focus on the optimality properties of preference-based agent matching mechanisms, but generally these studies are set in static contexts <ref> [18] </ref>. Since actual social interactions are often characterized both by evolutionary dynamics and by preference-based partner selection, studying both aspects together seems a logical and interesting next step to take. This issue is addressed in Stanley et al. [20]. <p> Each employer n can hire up to A n workers, and employers can refuse work offers. Once matched, a worker and employer engage in work site interactions modelled as a PD game. This TNG special case extends the usual assignment problem <ref> [18] </ref> by incorporating subsequent strategic game play between matched pairs of agents and by having game play iterated over time. <p> As detailed in Roth and Sotomayor <ref> [18] </ref>, this mechanism continues to be the subject of numerous theoretical studies, and it has found practical application as well|most notably to the labor market for medical interns and residents. <p> Intuitively, given conditions (a), (b), and (c), the buyer m and seller n could block the implementation of the matching outcome G by agreeing to play each other instead. Roth and Sotomayor <ref> [18] </ref> are careful to 6 differentiate between group stable and pairwise stable matching outcomes, whereby the former they mean a matching outcome that is not blocked by any coalition of agents. <p> The proof is a generalization of the optimality proof provided in Gale and Shapley [6, Thm. 2, p. 14] for their college admissions problem with B disjoint from S and offer quotas O m = 1 for all agents m in B; see also Roth and Sotomayor <ref> [18, Chapter 5] </ref>. DEFINITION 3.3. A matching outcome G will be called B-optimal if: (a) G is a stable matching outcome; and (b) each buyer matched under G is at least as well off under G as under any other stable matching outcome.

Reference-contexts: Since actual social interactions are often characterized both by evolutionary dynamics and by preference-based partner selection, studying both aspects together seems a logical and interesting next step to take. This issue is addressed in Stanley et al. <ref> [20] </ref>. <p> The ostracism of defectors occurs endogenously as an increasing number of players individually refuse the defectors' game offers. Nevertheless, choice and refusal also permit opportunistic players to home in quickly on exploitable players and form parasitic relationships. The computer experiments reported in <ref> [20] </ref> and in the subsequent studies by Ashlock et al. [1], Smucker et al.

These TNG experiments reinforce the previous IPD/CR findings of Stanley et al. <ref> [20] </ref> and Ashlock et al. [1] that a preference-based matching mechanism tends to accelerate the emergence of mutual cooperation in the IPD when each agent is permitted both to make and to refuse game offers, is unconstrained with regard to the number of received offers he can accept, and is permitted

Reference-contexts: At the beginning of the initial trade cycle loop, before any actual trades have taken place, each tradebot v associates an exogenously given prior expected payoff U 0 v (k) with each potential trade partner k. Throughout each trade cycle, tradebot v then uses a simple variable-gain criterion filter <ref> [21] </ref> to update his current expected payoffs on the basis of the new payoffs he obtains from interactions with his potential trade partners.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, it has proved difficult to characterize the mapping from parameter configurations to evolutionary outcomes for the IPD/CR. 1 This paper is based on Tesfatsion <ref> [22] </ref>. An abbreviated version of this paper is scheduled to appear in the Proceedings Volume of the Fifth Annual Conference on Evolutionary Programming. The author is grateful to D. Fogel, M. Smucker, and N. <p> See, for example, Brock and Durlauf [2], De Vany [3], Durlauf [4], Ionnides [10], and Vriend [23]. 1 A potentially useful way to proceed, then, is to focus on more concrete settings which impose problem-specific constraints on agent interactions. In Tesfatsion <ref> [22] </ref> an evolutionary trade network game (TNG) is proposed for studying the interplay between evolutionary dynamics and endogenous preference-based partner selection under alternatively specified market structures. <p> A new trade cycle loop then commences. The modular form of the TNG facilitates experimentation with alternative specifications for trade partner matching, trading, expectation updating, and trade strategy evolution. This paper presents preliminary experimental results obtained for the particular TNG module specifications outlined in Tesfatsion <ref> [22] </ref> using the C++ trade platform developed in McFadzean and Tesfatsion [?]. As will be clarified below, trade partners are determined in accordance with a deferred choice and refusal (DCR) mechanism, a modified Gale-Shapley matching mechanism [6] that retains the static optimality properties of the original Gale-Shapley mechanism. <p> In this way, tradebot v keeps a running tab on the payoff outcomes of his interactions with k. As explained in Tesfatsion <ref> [22, Section 5] </ref>, this updating procedure guarantees that the expected payoff tradebot v associates with k converges to the true average payoff tradebot v attains from interactions with k as the number of interactions between v and k becomes arbitrarily large. <p> The first proposition provides an upper bound for K fl . The proofs for this proposition, and for all subsequent propositions, are detailed in Tesfatsion <ref> [22, Section 4] </ref>. PROPOSITION 3.1. Let M denote the number of buyers in the buyer set B, and let N denote the number of sellers in the seller set S.
