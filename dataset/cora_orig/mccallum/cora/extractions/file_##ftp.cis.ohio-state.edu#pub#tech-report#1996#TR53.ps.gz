Abstract: ATM Forum Document Number: ATM Forum/96-1267 ******************************************************************************* Title: ABR Switch Algorithm Testing: A Case Study with ERICA ******************************************************************************* Abstract: This contribution discusses the requirements of ATM Available Bit Rate switch algorithms, and demonstrates how each of these requirements can be tested. As a case study, the performance of the ERICA switch algorithm [1] is evaluated and the effect of some features and options of the algorithm is examined. The requirements tested include: efficiency, delay, fairness, transient and steady state performance, scalability, and adaptation to variable capacity and various source traffic models. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated for various configurations and background traffic patterns. ******************************************************************************* Source: Raj Jain, Sonia Fahmy, Shivkumar Kalyanaraman, and Rohit Goyal The Ohio State University Department of CIS Columbus, OH 43210 Phone: 614-292-3989, Fax: 614-292-2911, Email: Jain@CIS.Ohio-State.Edu The presentation of this contribution at ATM Forum is sponsored by NASA. ******************************************************************************* Date: October 1996 ******************************************************************************* Distribution: ATM Forum Technical Working Group Members (Traffic Management) ******************************************************************************* Notice: This contribution has been prepared to assist the ATM Forum.

Reference-contexts: The Explicit Rate Indication for Congestion Avoidance (ERICA) algorithm was presented at the Forum in February 1995 and the complete description of the algorithm was compiled in <ref> [1] </ref>. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the design of experiments to test all aspects and requirements of ABR switch algorithms. <p> The ERICA algorithm is applied to each output port (or link). In this section, we first briefly describe the original ERICA algorithm, and then summarize its features, enhancements and options. For a complete description of the ERICA algorithm, including pseudocode and flowcharts, see <ref> [1] </ref>. 4.1 The Original Algorithm The switch periodically monitors the load on each link and determines a load factor, z, the available capacity, and the number of currently active VCs.

Reference-contexts: When a source receives a BRM, it computes its allowed cell rate (ACR) using its current ACR, two of the flags in the RM cell, and the ER field of the RM cell. For a detailed explanation of source end system behavior, see <ref> [8] </ref>. 3 Ob jectives of Traffic Management Traffic is a difficult problem because traffic management schemes attempt to achieve a wide variety of objectives, such as: 1. Efficiency and minimal delay. There is a tradeoff between the link utilization and the end-to-end delay.

Reference-contexts: In such situations, the switches reallocate the unused capacity to the other sources which are unconstrained. However, if the ACR retaining sources suddenly use their allocations, a potential overload situation exists <ref> [11] </ref>. larger number of connections has been selected to demonstrate the scalability of ERICA to more VCs, as well as to aggravate the problem of ACR retention. Initially, the ten sources are retaining their ACRs, and each cannot send at a rate of more than 10 Mbps.

Reference-contexts: Upon the receipt of the response at the source, and after a certain period of time, the source sends another request for data, and the cycle is repeated <ref> [12] </ref>. The figures show the performance of the reverse (response) connection where a burst of data is sent in response to every request. shows the effect of medium burst sizes and figure 24 illustrates the effect of large burst sizes.

Reference-contexts: Steady state characteristics can be tested using persistent sources which always have cells to send. Most schemes attempt to exhibit minimal oscillations during steady state conditions. In the real world, the transient response is almost as important as steady state performance. Jain and Routhier <ref> [14] </ref> point out that most real world traffic is bursty because most sources are transient. Transient response can be tested using transient sources which start after other sources have started and/or stop before the other sources have stopped.
