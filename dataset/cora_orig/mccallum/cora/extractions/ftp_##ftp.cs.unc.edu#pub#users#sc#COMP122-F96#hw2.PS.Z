Abstract: P-5 Assume that each record R j in a certain file contains two keys, a "major key" K j and a "minor key" k j , with a linear ordering &lt; defined on each of the sets of keys. Then we can define "lexicographic order" between pairs of keys (K; k) in the usual way: K p(1) = = K p(i 1 ) &lt; K p(i 1 +1) = = K p(i 2 ) &lt; &lt; K p(i n-1 +1) = = K p(i n ) ; where i n = N. He then sorted each of the n groups R p(i j-1 +1) ; : : : ; R p(i j ) on their minor keys. Mr. B took the same original file and sorted it first on the minor keys; then he took the resulting file, and sorted it on the major keys. Mr. C took the same original file and did a single sorting operation on it, using lexicographic order on the major and minor keys (K j ; k j ). Did all three men obtain the same result?
