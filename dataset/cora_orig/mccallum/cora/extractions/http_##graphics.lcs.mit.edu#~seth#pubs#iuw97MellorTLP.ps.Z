Abstract: This paper describes a method for generating dense depth maps given large numbers of images taken from arbitrary positions. The algorithm presented is completely local and uses an epipolar image to generate for each pixel an evidence versus depth and surface normal distribution. In many cases, the distribution contains a clear and distinct global maximum. The location of this peak determines the depth and its shape can be used to estimate the error. The distribution can also be used to perform a maximum likelihood fit of models directly to the images. We anticipate that the ability to perform maximum likelihood estimation from purely local calculations will prove useful in constructing three dimensional models from large sets of images.

Reference-contexts: An epipolar image is similar to an epipolar-plane image <ref> [ Bolles et al., 1987 ] </ref> , but has one critical difference that ensures it can be constructed for every pixel in an arbitrary set of images.

Reference-contexts: In most cases, depth can be recovered using purely local information, avoiding the computational costs of global constraints. Where depth cannot be recovered using purely local information, the depth evidence from the epipolar image provides a principled distribution for use in a maximum-likelihood approach <ref> [ Duda and Hart, 1973 ] </ref> . 2 Our Approach We assume that camera pose is known in an absolute coordinate system. Although relative positions are sufficient for the discussion in this section, global positions allow us to perform reconstruction incrementally using disjoint scenes.

Reference-contexts: Although relative positions are sufficient for the discussion in this section, global positions allow us to perform reconstruction incrementally using disjoint scenes. We also assume known internal camera parameters.
