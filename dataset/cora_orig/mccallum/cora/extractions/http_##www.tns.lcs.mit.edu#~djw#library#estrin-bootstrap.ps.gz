Title: A Dynamic Bootstrap Mechanism for Rendezvous-based Multicast Routing  
Author: Deborah Estrin, Mark Handley, Ahmed Helmy, Polly Huang, David Thaler 
Abstract: Current multicast routing protocols can be classified into three types according to how the multicast tree is established: broadcast and prune (e.g., DVMRP, PIM-DM), membership advertisement (e.g., MOSPF), and rendezvous-based (e.g., CBT, PIM-SM). Rendezvous-based protocols associate with each logical multicast group address, a physical unicast address, referred to as the `core' or `rendezvous point' (RP). Members first join a multicast tree rooted at this rendezvous point in order to receive data packets sent to the group. Rendezvous mechanisms are well suited to large wide-area networks because they distribute group-specific data and membership information only to those routers that are on the multicast distribution tree. However, rendezvous protocols require a bootstrap mechanism to map each logical multicast address to its current physical rendezvous-point address. The bootstrap mechanism must adapt to network and router failures but should minimize unnecessary changes in the group-to-RP mapping. In addition, the bootstrap mechanism should be transparent to the hosts. This paper describes and analyzes the bootstrap mechanism developed for PIM-SM. The mechanism employs an algorithmic mapping of multicast group to rendezvous point address, based on a set of available RPs distributed throughout a multicast domain. The primary evaluation measures are convergence time, message distribution overhead, balanced assignment of groups to RPs, and host impact. The mechanism as a whole, and the design lessons in particular, are applicable to other rendezvous-based multicast routing protocols as well.

As shown in Figure 1, when a receiver's local router (A) discovers it has local receivers, it starts sending periodic join-messages toward a group-specific Rendezvous Point (RP). <p> This time will be on the order of the region's end-to-end delay and the bootstrap router timeout values (see section 3.1). The BSR election mechanism is integrated with the RP-Set distribution mechanism described in section 2.3. Complete mechanistic details are given in appendix A and <ref> [7] </ref>. 2.2 RP-Set construction using Candidate-RP-Advertisements A set of routers within a PIM domain are configured as candidate RPs. Typically these are the same routers that are configured as candidate BSRs 2 . <p> A bootstrap message is multicast out all interfaces with a TTL of 1, to all directly connected PIM routers <ref> [7] </ref>. Before accepting a bootstrap message, a PIM router performs two checks: 1. Only those bootstrap messages that arrive from the Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) neighbor 4 towards the BSR are processed, others are discarded. The RPF check prevents looping of bootstrap messages. <p> We call the state in which the elected BSR originates periodic messages the steady state. 5 All default values mentioned here are set as per the PIMv2 specification <ref> [7] </ref>. 7 * Bootstrap timeout (`BootstrapTimeout'): The time after which a Candidate-BSR originates a bootstrap message to elect a new BSR. <p> These results were based on several simplifications and assumptions. The constants (C b and C j ) were assumed to be negligible as compared to the other terms, and default values from the PIM-SM specification <ref> [7] </ref> were used for the JoinPeriod, BootstrapPeriod, RPTimeout, BootstrapTimeout, and RPAdvPeriod.

Reference-contexts: When f (k) is uniformly distributed, the disruption will thus be n1 n , or almost all the groups. Clearly, this is insufficient for our purposes. A much better scheme, which we employ, is the Highest Random Weight (HRW) algorithm <ref> [18] </ref>. <p> If f is sufficiently random with respect to k and l, this has the desirable property that the disruption caused by m RPs changing is just m=n. This successfully achieves the minimum bound on disruption as shown in <ref> [18] </ref>. 14 We now need to find an appropriate function for f that satisfies the above constraint. <p> For this, we use the following function: f (k; l (i)) = (1103515245 ((1103515245k + 12345) XOR l (i)) + 12345) mod 2 31 which is derived from the BSD rand () function, and is shown in <ref> [18] </ref> to perform well as a hash function compared with other pseudo-random number generators. It also lends itself well to an efficient 32-bit implementation.
