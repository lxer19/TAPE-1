Reference-contexts: Since we have two different counters (N fl and N fl ) we will be able to compute a lower and upper bound for the conditional probability directly from the database by extending to intervals the definition of conditional probabilities under a symmetric Dirichlet distribution hypothesis <ref> [ Cooper and Herskovitz, 1992 ] </ref> , according to the following formulas: (N fl (C i ) + 1) P fl (C i jA) = (T + k) where k is the number of possible values of the consequent variable and T is defined as P 3.3 Putting the IBN at

Reference-contexts: The assignment of probability bounds to propositions and clauses allows the user to express ignorance about his own knowledge. 2.2 Representing Conditionals Extending the usual logical concepts of soundness and completeness from boolean values to probability intervals <ref> [ Grosof, 1986 ] </ref> , we can say that the system defined by the set of constraints (2) is probabilistically sound (i.e. it returns intervals that are equal to or wider than the intended ones), but it is not complete (i.e. it does not return intervals that are equal to or

Reference-contexts: to forecast blood glucose concentration in insulin-dependent diabetic patients using underspecified probabilistic models directly derived from a database containing the daily follow-up of 70 insulin-dependent diabetic patients. 2 Outline of the Methodology During the past decade, AI researchers have developed a class of reasoning systems, called Truth Maintenance Systems (tmss) <ref> [ McAllester, 1990 ] </ref> , which are able to deal with partially specified knowledge. tmss are reasoning systems that incrementally record justifications for beliefs and propagate binary truth values along chains of justifications. <p> The lbms can be regarded as a generalization to interval truth values of the Boolean Constraint Propagation method <ref> [ McAllester, 1990 ] </ref> . <p> There are two motivations behind the choice of this particular set of clauses. First of all, we found that the 130 calculation of the overlapping factor is the only source of complexity in the lbms which, being assimilable to the Boolean Constraint Propagation <ref> [ McAllester, 1990 ] </ref> , is expected to run in linear time.

Reference-contexts: Full propositional formulas are encoded in clausal form by the lbms. Probabilistic logic <ref> [ Nilsson, 1986 ] </ref> provides a semantic framework for extending the standard (boolean) concept of satisfaction to a probabilistic one, that can be regarded as a generalization of the Venn Diagrams representation, a set-theoretic interpretation of probability.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the constraints directly derived from inequality (1) turn out to be too weak: the bounds they produce are too wide, thus including inconsistent values. The INFERNO system [ Quinlan, 1983 ] , that is usually regarded as a local approximation to probabilistic logic <ref> [ Nilsson, 1993 ] </ref> , exhibits this kind of behavior. The weakness of the constraints derived from (1) arises from too strong an enforcement of their locality based on the assumption that, in the Venn Diagrams representation of a clause, the intersection of all propositions is always empty. <p> Since we have devised an efficient method to calculate the overlapping factor and to apply constraint (2.3), and since probabilistic entailment is known to be intractable in nature <ref> [ Nilsson, 1993 ] </ref> , the incompleteness of the lbms represents a compromise between functionality and efficiency.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Predictions about the future evolution of the patient's state play a central role in the interpretation of clinical data and in medical decision making: predictions are required both for prognostic assessment and for therapy planning, and are necessary for testing diagnostic hypotheses as well. Bayesian Belief Networks (bbns) <ref> [ Pearl, 1988 ] </ref> provide a powerful formalism for developing systems able to forecast a patient's evolution, and they have been successfully applied to several medical tasks. A bbn is a direct acyclic graph in which nodes represent stochastic variables and links represent causal relationships among those variables.

Reference-contexts: several attempts have been made to include probabilities in tmss. tmss that are able to reason on 129 the basis of probabilistic rather than binary truth values are called Belief Maintenance Systems (bmss). 2.1 Logic-based Belief Maintenance Systems We have introduced a new kind of bms, called Logic-based bms (lbms) <ref> [ Ramoni and Riva, 1993 ] </ref> in which Boolean connectives of standard logic act as constraints on the (probabilistic) truth values of propositions. The lbms can be regarded as a generalization to interval truth values of the Boolean Constraint Propagation method [ McAllester, 1990 ] . <p> It is easy to see that this assumption is too strong. Generalizing definition (1) to interval truth values, we derived a set of constraints on the minimum and maximum probability of propositions <ref> [ Ramoni and Riva, 1993 ] </ref> .
