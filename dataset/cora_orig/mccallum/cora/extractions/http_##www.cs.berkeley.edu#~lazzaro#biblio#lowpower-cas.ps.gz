Author: John Lazzaro

Abstract: This paper presents low-power versions of two circuits often used in analog VLSI models of neural systems. The circuits model the spiking behavior of the axon hillock and the pulse propagation of axons.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction As device dimensions decrease, die sizes increase, and wafer-scale techniques mature, power consumption becomes a dominant issue in VLSI system design. A silicon neural design style that operates MOS transistors in the weak-inversion regime <ref> [1] </ref> [2] supports low-power VLSI design. In this design style, popular circuits that model continuous-time dendritic processing operate all transistors in the weak-inversion regime. <p> At this point, V o switches to ground potential, and the pulse is complete. The voltage V c is reset to a value below the switching threshold of the amplifier, that depends on the relative values of C f and C. This circuit, as described in <ref> [1] </ref>, uses two digital inverters in series as the high-gain amplifier; Figure 2 (top) shows this amplifier implementation. When used in the spiking neuron circuit, the transistors in first inverter of this amplifier are biased outside the weak-inversion regime. <p> All data was taken with the values of K 1 and K 2 necessary for correct circuit function with 10s pulses; the current consumption for longer pulse-width operation can be reduced by adjusting K 1 and K 2 . 4 The Axonal Delay Circuit circuit described in <ref> [1] </ref>. In engineering terms, the circuit is a cascade of non-retriggerable monostables, each with a voltage output V k , that is either at V dd or at ground potential.
