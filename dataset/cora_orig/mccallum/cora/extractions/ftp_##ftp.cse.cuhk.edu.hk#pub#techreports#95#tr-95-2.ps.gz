Title: Scheduling and Replacement Policies for a Hierarchical Multimedia Storage Server

Abstract: Recent advances of computer storage architectures, high speed networking technologies and compression techniques support a proliferation of multimedia information dissemination via computer networks. For example, applications like video-on-demand (VOD) and home shopping services are now possible. A major requirement of VOD application is that the VOD storage server has to store and retrieve a huge amount of video data in a continuous manner. Therefore, near-line storage devices, such as robotic tape library, have to be employed in VOD storage servers which can contain thousands of large video objects. In this paper, we study in detail the design issues of a hierarchical multimedia storage server that consists of a disk array for caching and a robotic tape library for the storage of all the video objects. We propose and study in detail the scheduling and replacement policies of the hierarchical multimedia storage server. We illustrate the file layout policy in the parallel disks system, the scheduling of the tape sub-system, the video object replacement algorithms and the read/write scheduling of the disk system.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, a type 2 page is replaced only in extreme conditions. Hence, the improvement of replac ing type 2 pages is negligible. Some tape, such as the D2 tapes used in Ampex DST800 robotic tape library, has the concept of zones <ref> [1] </ref>. A tape drive can stop transfering data at a zone, and later on, continue data transfer from where it stop. Hence, contiguous pages of an object can be read in non-contiguous time periods without the need of reposition.

Reference-contexts: There are two major factors which contribute to the tape average system response time, 1) the tape task arrival rate and, 2) the execution time of a tape task where the execution time of a tape is the time required to finish the tape task. By queueing theory <ref> [11] </ref>, the average tape system response time can be improved by minimizing the utilization of the tape system. To achieve this, if we can reduce the job arrival rate to the tape system, we reduce the tape utilization. <p> The EAT of the first page P 0 of the video file F is: EAT [P 0 ] = 0 if currently accessed a 2 2a 1 otherwise Note that a 2 2a 1 is the expected residual life of the arrival request <ref> [11] </ref>.

In <ref> [12] </ref>, a cost-effective VOD storage server architecture which employed both robotic tape system and parallel disks storage was introduced. In [8, 5], performance and reliability study was carried out on a robotic storage system. <p> Note that there are two factors affecting the miss ratio, 1) the page size and, the page replacement policy. For the same tape system utilization, the average response time is better for shorter execution time of a tape task. In <ref> [12] </ref>, we shown that different execution times of a tape task are required to optimize the average tape system response time. For a given storage size of the disk system, the miss ratio is smaller for smaller page size because page replacement can be performed in a finer granularity level. <p> The result shows that under different load conditions of the tape system, different page sizes are needed to optimize the request waiting time. This phenomena was first reported in <ref> [12] </ref>. The optimal page size grows with the increase of request arrival rate. For example, the optimal page size grows from 200 to 800 fragments when the request arrival rate increases from 20 to 40 requests/hour. The reason is as follows.

In [20], the authors presented a technique for storing video and audio streams individually on magnetic disk. <p> This approach suffers from inefficient bandwidth utilization or large buffer requirements <ref> [13] </ref>. The major contributions of this paper is twofold. First, we propose and study a novel architecture for supporting constant frame rate with variable bit retrieval. We describe the data layout on disks, the admission control algorithm, read/write scheduling policies in the disk and tape sub-systems. <p> Since the size of each frames is highly variable <ref> [13] </ref>, this kind of I/O bandwidth allocation cannot efficiently utilize the storage server, and thereby much fewer concurrent clients are supported. The system we describe here can easily support a constant frame rate at the display station with variable bit rate I/O retrieval. <p> Therefore, once the start time of a request is determined, the deadline of a fragment retrieval of the request can be determined by adding up the playback periods of all preceding fragments and the request start time. We term the above scheme as round-robin striping <ref> [13] </ref>. It is interesting to point out that in [9], the authors described several ways of reducing I/O demand for the VOD storage server. <p> Also, Algorithm ScheduleDisk Task minimizes the required memory buffer for the tasks. Theorem 1 Given a set of tasks that can be sched uled by the EDF algorithm, Algorithm Schedule Task finds a feasible schedule of tasks that requires a minimal buffer space. Proof: please refer to <ref> [13] </ref>. 3.4 Scheduling of Disk Writes A fragment retrieved from the tape system will stay in the memory buffer until it is written (stored) into the disk system. Because a fragment in the memory buffer can be displayed immediately, a disk write does not have a deadline.
