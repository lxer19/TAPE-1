Abstract: This year, AAAI's National Conference on Artifical Intelligence honors a paper that exemplifies high standards in technical contribution and exposition. Papers were nominated for the Outstanding Paper Award by members of the program committee during the NCAI review process. These nominations were then reviewed once again by a smaller subset of the program committee to select the winning paper. Care was taken during the review process to ensure that our final decisions were based on the opinions of impartial readers who are free from personal biases and conflicts of interest.
