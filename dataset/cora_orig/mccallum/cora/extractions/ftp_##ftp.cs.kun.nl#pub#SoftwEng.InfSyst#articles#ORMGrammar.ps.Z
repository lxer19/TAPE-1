Abstract: In this paper information modelling is considered as a process leading to a grammar that describes the communication of an information system with its users. This grammar (the information grammar) should approximate as close as possible the language spoken in the problem domain (the expert language). We first describe how the information grammar is constructed and its relation to the expert language. The information grammar is centered around the information structure and concretized by names for the elements of the information structure and verbalization rules for their instances. PSM is used to describe an information structure, while LISA-D is the framework for the information grammar. The semantics of LISA-D is expressed in terms of path expressions, a (for this purpose) convenient variant of relational algebra. As it is important that queries can be formulated in a way close to the perception of users, LISA-D exploits the natural language approach of NIAM (of which PSM is an extension). Queries in LISA-D can be formulated in terms used in the application domain involved. This, of course, is an important prerequisite for achieving succesful query formulation support. Finally, the concepts of query by navigation and query by construction are introduced as mechanisms to support query formulation.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, a decision criterion as in the case of specialisation (the subtype defining rule) is not necessary. Furthermore, properties are inherited "upward" in a gen-eralisation hierarchy instead of "downward", which is the case for specialisation (see also <ref> [AH87] </ref>). This also implies that the identification of a generalised object type depends on the identification of its specifiers. constructed by some function (say f) from simpler formulas.

Reference-contexts: Rule markers should also not be defined by the lexicon. Furthermore, the rule markers ! 1 ; : : : ; ! n should not occur as starting markers of other macro definitions (one might say that the language should be LL (1), see e.g. <ref> [ASU86] </ref>). Finally, the rule markers have the lowest priority in order to avoid problems with the parsing of empty markers. The evaluation of a macro call uses a fixpoint computation, as macros may be defined recursively in terms of each other.

Reference-contexts: positions from which the first player can win (<ref> [Cha88] </ref>). This is captured by the following macro: Winning-Positions IS is-direct-win UNION may-lead-to Position ALL IN Position may-lead-to Winning-Positions The above query is an example of a query that cannot be expressed as a so-called stratified query (see figure 14, taken from [Cha88]). Stratified queries can express all the first order queries and negation is allowed between the so-called strata.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown however that stratified queries do not express all fixpoint queries, in particular, they have difficulty taking fixpoints over universal quantifiers, such as is needed in the above query (see <ref> [Kol91, Dah87] </ref>). The macro mechanism of LISA-D allows for the specification of arbitrary fixpoint queries. There are, however, some relatively simple queries which cannot be expressed as fixpoint queries (due to lack of arithmetic operations).

Reference-contexts: Consequently, using these names in the formulation of queries and constraints will yield (generally speaking) results very close to the original formulation in natural language of these queries and constraints. The first language to pursue this idea was the language RIDL (Reference and IDea Language <ref> [DMP84] </ref>, [Mee82]). RIDL, however, never received much acceptance as it did not have a formal syntax and semantics, and was based on a restricted binary version of NIAM (see e.g. [VB82]).

Reference-contexts: This algebra is not important for this example and is therefore omitted. 2 For information structures a number of axioms are defined, which are not important in the context of this paper (refer to <ref> [HPW93] </ref>). A naming v of information structure I is composed of the quartet ONm, PNm, QNm and RNm of naming functions. During information analysis, object types receive a unique name, recorded by the (partial) function ONm : O N , where N is a set of names. <p> For a definition of and a complete treatment of the set of population rules, we refer to <ref> [HPW93] </ref>. In the rest of this section only those population rules that are relevant in the context of this paper are presented. <p> LISA-D (Language for Information Structure and Access Descriptions) can be considered as a redesign of RIDL with a functionality far exceeding that of RIDL. The formal semantics of LISA-D is defined in <ref> [HPW93] </ref> by means of a translation to path expressions. Path expressions form the semantical base for information grammars. They also will form the basis for visualization of the disclosure mechanism (see section 6). Path expressions are an extension of relational algebra emphasizing concatenation of relations. <p> Finally, it should be remarked that not the complete definition of the path expressions and the information descriptors is presented. For both, only a relevant (for the purpose of this paper) subset of the existing constructions is presented. For a complete definition, refer to <ref> [HPW93] </ref>. 3.1 The construction of the lexicon The basis for LISA-D information descriptors is a lexicon, assigning a meaning to the words (names) that constitute the language. The meaning of names is administered by the relation Lexicon Names fi PE 13 where Names is a set of names. <p> Each combination of values may address at most one instance of object type O. In this paper we do not consider how the object identity rule may be represented in the information structure by graphical constraints (uniqueness constraint and total role constraint), for more details see <ref> [HPW93] </ref>. As an example, consider figure 3. <p> In case m = 1, the element verbalization yields: hhO : a 1 k Lii Note that the rules for populating power types exclude the possibility m = 0 (see <ref> [HPW93] </ref>). Of course, the verbalization of power types may employ some external identification.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, if an activity graph does not contain any states, then States: hState : State PART OF Activity-graph xi + will not be productive. This construction is also useful when an existential uniqueness constraint is involved (see <ref> [HW94] </ref>). An existensional uniqueness constraint provides an alternative way of modelling set behaviour. 5 Linear path verbalization In the last section of this paper, focus is on the Doolittle Query Constructor, a tool for supporting query formulation.

Reference-contexts: PNm (p) = p For unique fact participation names, the fact type name may be omitted. Predicators may also have a reverse participation name, QNm : Q N which verbalizes the decomposition of the fact type into the components involved. In binary versions of NIAM, (e.g. [Win90] or <ref> [VB82] </ref>), role names are very important as they are used to form readable sentences over the information structure, as remarked in the previous section. <p> The first language to pursue this idea was the language RIDL (Reference and IDea Language [DMP84], [Mee82]).

The formal semantics of LISA-D is defined in [HPW93] by means of a translation to path expressions.
