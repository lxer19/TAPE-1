Reference-contexts: An appropriate recurrence then yields a running time that is O (m) with high probability. The number X of edges in the sample graph H is binomially distributed with mean m 0 =2 m=2.

Reference-contexts: It follows that the expected running time is linear. The recurrence relation resembles the one arising in the analysis of a linear-time selection algorithm <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We consider the problem of finding a minimum spanning tree in a connected graph with real-valued edge weights. This problem has a long and rich history; the first fully realized algorithm was devised by Bor-uvka in the 1920's <ref> [3] </ref>. An informative survey paper by Graham and Hell [10] describes the history of the problem up to 1985. <p> Proof : The expected value is X Prob [number of F -light edges exceeds k]: We obtain the bound n=p by substituting the bound (1) and applying standard techniques for series summation. 2 3 3 The Algorithm The algorithm intermeshes steps of Bor-uvka's minimum-spanning-tree algorithm <ref> [3] </ref> with random-sampling steps that discard edges that cannot be in the minimum spanning tree. Each Bor-uvka step reduces the number of vertices by at least a factor of two.

Reference-contexts: Later, Komlos [15] showed that a minimum spanning tree can be verified in O (m) binary comparisons of edge weights, but with nonlinear overhead to decide which comparisons to make. Dixon, Rauch and Tarjan <ref> [6] </ref> recently combined these algorithms with a table lookup technique to obtain an O (m)-time verification algorithm. In this paper we describe a randomized algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree. It has an expected running time of O (m) in the restricted random-access model. <p> Given a forest F in G, the F -heavy edges of G can be computed in time linear in the number of edges of G, using an adaptation of the verification algorithm of Dixon, Rauch, and Tarjan. (Page 1188 in <ref> [6] </ref> describes the changes needed in the algorithm.) Lemma 1 Let H be a subgraph obtained from G by including each edge independently with probability p, and let F be the minimum spanning forest of H.

Reference-contexts: The parallel algorithm does linear work and runs in expected O (log n 2 log fl n ) time on a CRCW PRAM [14]. This is the first parallel algorithm for minimum spanning tree that does linear work. In contrast, Karger <ref> [11] </ref> gives an algorithm running on an EREW PRAM that requires O (log n) time and m= log n + n 1+* processors for any constant * &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we describe a randomized algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree. It has an expected running time of O (m) in the restricted random-access model. The algorithm is a modification of one proposed by Karger <ref> [12] </ref>, who obtained an expected time bound of O (m + n log n). Our algorithm uses the random-sampling technique of Karger in combination with the verification algorithm of Dixon, Rauch, and Tarjan to discard edges that cannot be in the minimum spanning tree. <p> Can randomization be used to simplify the linear-time verification algorithm? 3. Can randomization be used fruitfully to solve other network optimization problems, such as the shortest-path problem?

Reference-contexts: In joint work with Richard Cole to be described in a future paper, we have adapted our algorithm to run in parallel. The parallel algorithm does linear work and runs in expected O (log n 2 log fl n ) time on a CRCW PRAM <ref> [14] </ref>. This is the first parallel algorithm for minimum spanning tree that does linear work.

Reference-contexts: A problem related to finding minimum spanning trees is that of verifying that a given spanning tree is minimum. Tarjan [18] gave a verification algorithm running in O (m ff (m; n)) time, where ff is a functional inverse of Ackermann's function. Later, Komlos <ref> [15] </ref> showed that a minimum spanning tree can be verified in O (m) binary comparisons of edge weights, but with nonlinear overhead to decide which comparisons to make. Dixon, Rauch and Tarjan [6] recently combined these algorithms with a table lookup technique to obtain an O (m)-time verification algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Proof. Let e 1 ; e 2 ; :::; e m be the edges of G, arranged in increasing order by weight. Consider the following computation, a variant of Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm <ref> [16] </ref>. Begin with an empty forest F . Process the edges e j in increasing order on j. To process an edge e j , first flip a coin that has probability p of coming up heads. If the coin does come up heads, include e j in H.

Reference-contexts: In this model they were able to devise a linear-time algorithm. Still, the question of whether a linear-time algorithm exists for the restricted random-access model remained open. A problem related to finding minimum spanning trees is that of verifying that a given spanning tree is minimum. Tarjan <ref> [18] </ref> gave a verification algorithm running in O (m ff (m; n)) time, where ff is a functional inverse of Ackermann's function.

Reference-contexts: Our algorithm actually solves the slightly more general problem of finding a minimum spanning forest in a possibly disconnected graph. We assume familiarity with standard results on minimum spanning trees, as presented, for example, in <ref> [19] </ref>. 2 A Sampling Lemma In order to present the sampling result, we need a little terminology. Let G be a graph with weighted edges. We denote by w (x; y) the weight of edge fx; yg.
