Abstract: For saddle point problems stemming from appending essential boundary conditions in connection with Galerkin methods for elliptic boundary value problems, a class of multilevel preconditioners is developed. The estimates are based on the characterization of Sobolev spaces on the underlying domain and its boundary in terms of weighted sequence norms relative to corresponding multilevel expansions. The results indicate how the various ingredients of a typical multilevel framework affect the growthrate of the condition numbers. In particular, it is shown how to realize even condition numbers that are uniformly bounded independently of the discretization. These investigations are motivated by the idea of employing nested refin-able shift-invariant spaces as trial spaces covering various types of wavelets that are of advantage for the solution of boundary value problems from other points of view. Instead of incorporating the boundary conditions into the approximation spaces in the Galerkin formulation, they are appended by means of Lagrange multipliers leading to a saddle point problem.

We assume that a (; ) is continuous and elliptic on H k (). (However, the latter condition can be relaxed, see the remarks following (2.2.6) below).

Reference-contexts: Problems of this type are commonly referred to as saddle point problems since the equations (2.1.3) are the optimality conditions for computing inf sup 1 (see e.g. <ref> [B] </ref>, pp. 119). In this context, the quantity q is often referred to as Lagrange multiplier. <p> A classical iterative method for (2.3.6) is Uzawa's algorithm where one solves, for a sufficiently small parameter ! &gt; 0 the equations u (I A)u + f B T p (2.3.9) 6 alternatingly starting with an approximation for p, see e.g. <ref> [B] </ref>, pp. 183. There one can also find a corresponding conjugate gradient algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Among the various approaches to treat saddle point problems, all of them making more or less use of the so-called Schur complement, I have adapted the strategy developed in <ref> [BP1] </ref> which transforms saddle point problems by means of a `good' preconditioner for the stiffness matrix on the domain to a system which is positive definite with respect to a weighted inner product. <p> Realizing that each method has its advantages and drawbacks but all of them involve an (exact or approximative) computation of the Schur complement BA 1 B T , we adapt in the following the procedure introduced in <ref> [BP1] </ref> to the abstract framework. Firstly, in this method a good preconditioner for A is required, and secondly, it isolates the question of preconditioning BA 1 B T without computing A 1 . <p> In case that C may not satisfy (2.3.11) a priori, one could estimate the lowest eigenvalue of C 1=2 AC 1=2 by the power method [BP2] and scale the preconditioner C accordingly <ref> [BP1] </ref>. The cost of this computation is reported to be small compared to the subsequent iteration of the following transformed saddle point problem. <p> Furthermore, the following theorem from <ref> [BP1] </ref> shows that N given by N 1 := I 0 7 is a good preconditioner for the operator M with respect to [; ]. Hence, an appro-priate preconditioner for BA 1 B T is ultimately one for M after inflating with the identity operator. <p> Thus, any standard iterative technique employing [; ] may be applied to solve (2.3.14) so that one should also estimate condition numbers with respect to [; ]. The appendix in <ref> [BP1] </ref> contains an adapted conjugate gradient method utilizing [; ].

Reference-contexts: Moreover, for bivariate polygonal domains the restriction of a spline as generator ' to the boundary is a univariate spline, generally on a non-uniform grid. Consequently, one can compute spline-pre-wavelets on each segment of the boundary explicitly by following the lines in <ref> [CDP] </ref> or [LyM], giving equations like (3.4.7) below. Thus, whenever stable bases of W and X are known as in this case, the construction of the preconditioner can be performed by a change of bases as follows. <p> 2 T m relative to the multilevel basis into those with respect to , L y ; = y ; : (3:4:6) To determine L explicitly, assume that the coefficients in the refinement equations ' fi; (x) = ff2I j+1; j+1 j+1 fi; (x) = ff2I j+1; j+1 j+1 (cf. <ref> [CDP] </ref>) are known. <p> Clearly the traces of box splines to are univariate splines on each segment of the boundary.

The theoretical and practical advantages of refinable shift-invariant spaces in contrary to the difficulties with handling boundary conditions seem to justify the effort of treating the essential boundary conditions separately. <p> To be precise, as in <ref> [DK] </ref>, in the case of second order problems we require to be minimally smooth which is equivalent to the strong local Lipschitz property ([A], pp. 66). This assumption includes, in particular, polyhedral domains. Accordingly, for higher order problems, is required to be more regular. <p> Utilizing tools from the well-founded and established theory of function spaces, see e.g. [DJP, DP, N, O1, T], one can extend the hierarchical-type construction of preconditioners of the recent years in [BPX, Y1, Y2] in a unified multilevel framework as done in <ref> [DK] </ref> to operators on the boundary. 3.1 Multilevel Estimates on To establish norm equivalences on the domain and its boundary, we briefly recall some recently established results from [D2]. <p> These conditions are satisfied e.g. for orthogonal projectors, or for projectors defined by means of biorthogonal bases as in <ref> [DK] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Whereas the first method leads again to condition numbers which grow polynomially with respect to their size (see e.g. <ref> [K] </ref>), the Lagrange multiplier technique turns out to be well-suited. Unfortunately, since this approach results in saddle point problems, i.e., systems of linear equations that are indefinite, different iterative methods and, consequently, different preconditioners are required. <p> estimates are based on characterizations of Sobolev spaces on the boundary of the domain in terms of weighted sequence norms relative to corresponding multilevel expansions. 2 The current paper can be viewed as an extension of the results in [DK] and is based to some extent on the investigations in <ref> [K] </ref>.

This can be exploited to satisfy the discrete formulation of the inf-sup-condition (2.2.7) uniformly in j, see Remark 3.3.2. <p> ( ^ h j ; P j h) L 2 () = ( ^ h j ; h) L 2 () for all ^ h j 2 ^ T j ; (3:2:9) and let P := fP j g j2IN 0 .

Reference-contexts: Moreover, for bivariate polygonal domains the restriction of a spline as generator ' to the boundary is a univariate spline, generally on a non-uniform grid. Consequently, one can compute spline-pre-wavelets on each segment of the boundary explicitly by following the lines in [CDP] or <ref> [LyM] </ref>, giving equations like (3.4.7) below. Thus, whenever stable bases of W and X are known as in this case, the construction of the preconditioner can be performed by a change of bases as follows. <p> Clearly the traces of box splines to are univariate splines on each segment of the boundary. However, the knots of these splines may not be equally spaced. Nevertheless, it is known how to construct orthogonal decompositions of such spline spaces <ref> [LyM, CDP] </ref>. The complement spaces are spanned by compactly supported functions so that the corresponding change of bases can be performed efficiently as pointed out above. Acknowledgement: I thank Wolfgang Dahmen very much for many discussions.

Reference-contexts: By employing multilevel techniques derived during the past few years, using the theory of function spaces, it could be shown that BPX-type preconditioners [BPX] give rise to condition numbers that do not grow with respect to the refinement level <ref> [DK, O3] </ref>. These techniques only need minimal regularity assumptions to establish optimal convergence rates. The results apply to classical finite elements on nonuniform partitions of the underlying domain as well as to wavelet-type functions provided that essential boundary conditions are incorporated into the solution space.

Reference-contexts: Let us briefly discuss the following more concrete situation. Let be a polygonal domain in IR 2 and ' be a box spline on , see e.g. [DLy].
