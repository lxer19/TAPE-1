Abstract: We present results on the use of neural network based autoassociators which act as novelty or anomaly detectors to detect imminent motor failures. The autoassociator is trained to reconstruct spectra obtained from the healthy motor. In laboratory tests, we have demonstrated that the trained autoassociator has a small reconstruction error on measurements recorded from healthy motors but a larger error on those recorded from a motor with a fault. We have designed and built a motor monitoring system using an autoassociator for anomaly detection and are in the process of testing the system at three industrial and commercial sites.

Reference-contexts: been generated, various statistical techniques can be used to determine if there has been a change in the distribution of values. 5 A Neural Network-based Anomaly Detector The core of the most successful monitoring system we have built to date is a neural network designed to function as an autoassociator <ref> (Rumelhart, Hinton & Williams, 1986, called it an encoder) </ref>. We use a simple three layer feedforward network with N inputs, N outputs and K &lt; N hidden units. The input layer is fully connected to the hidden layer which is fully connected to the output layer.

Reference-contexts: Based on work done elsewhere <ref> (Schoen, Habetler & Bartheld, 1994) </ref>, SE&A determined that it might be possible to use measurements of the current on a single phase of the power supply to estimate the vibration of the motor.
