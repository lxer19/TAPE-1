Abstract: Simulation plays an important role in stochastic geometry and related fields, because all but the simplest random set models tend to be intractable to analysis. Many simulation algorithms deliver (approximate) samples of such random set models, for example by simulating the equilibrium distribution of a Markov chain such as a spatial birth-and-death process. The samples usually fail to be exact because the algorithm simulates the Markov chain for a long but finite time, and thus convergence to equilibrium is only approximate. The seminal work by Propp and Wilson made an important contribution to simulation by proposing a coupling method, Coupling from the Past (CFTP), which delivers perfect, that is to say exact, simulations of Markov chains. In this paper we introduce this new idea of perfect simulation and illustrate it using two common models in stochastic geometry: the dead leaves model and a Boolean model conditioned to cover a finite set of points.

Reference-contexts: Convergence diagnostics have been developed to assist the decision on the length of the burn-in (that is to say, the number of initial iterations which should be discarded); for a recent review see <ref> [1] </ref>. Although these diagnostics might warn when convergence has not yet been reached, they cannot guarantee that the Markov chain is in or close to equilibrium. Recently Propp and Wilson [22] have devised an ingenious algorithm, which augments the simulation algorithm to produce a certificate whether equilibrium has been attained.

Reference-contexts: geology and mining engineering motivate the modelling of populations of (random) objects using Boolean random sets: a point pattern of germs is generated according to a Poisson point process and at each germ an object or grain is located which is an independent realisation of a random compact set (see <ref> [2, 16, 24] </ref>). Often experimental data is available which provides further information on the location of grains.

Reference-contexts: Here we introduce the idea of CFTP by considering the example of a simple random walk X with reflecting barriers at 0 and N , extending an example in <ref> [22, 3] </ref>. Of course one can easily calculate the equilibrium distribution of X, but suppose we want to use MCMC to sample from . <p> Although this algorithm is more efficient, it is less general than the above as it is developed for the special case of the penetrable spheres mixture process and associates. Note that CFTP is not the only method to produce perfect samples. Fill <ref> [3] </ref> proposed a perfect simulation algorithm for finite state-space Markov chains based on a version of Rejection Sampling.

Reference-contexts: Most commonly, Markov chains used to simulate point processes such as the Strauss process are spatial birth/death processes, i.e. as time passes random patterns of points are born and die in a Markov fashion. Helpful surveys on MCMC methods and applications for point processes can be found in <ref> [4, 17] </ref>. After defining the Markov chain, one needs to determine for how long the simulation should proceed in order to be close to equilibrium.

Reference-contexts: MCMC methods often use the Gibbs Sampler or (more generally) a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. These are designed such that the Markov chain has the target equilibrium distribution and can be simulated without knowing the normalizing constant. An overview of these two methods is given by the article by Roberts in <ref> [5] </ref>. Most commonly, Markov chains used to simulate point processes such as the Strauss process are spatial birth/death processes, i.e. as time passes random patterns of points are born and die in a Markov fashion.

Fix positive t, ffi, and set n point z i is covered at time t + ffi by a non-perpetuated grain itself born in [t; t + ffi] o 36 The FKG inequality <ref> [6, Theorem (2.4)] </ref> applies to the events A 1 , . . . A k , since adding further grains increases the family of these events which are satisfied by a realisation.

Among the references we have already mentioned there are studies of perfect simulation of area-interaction point processes <ref> [7, 9, 10, 26] </ref> (of which [26] uses a totally different technique, and [9] generalizes [12] to other point processes).

Reference-contexts: Indeed perfect simulation for the specific case of the Dead Leaves model is well-understood by Jeulin and other workers at the Matheron-Serra group in Fontainebleu. Statistical properties, further extensions and applications of this model are discussed in <ref> [8] </ref>. How can we produce an exact sample of the Dead Leaves model? We need to simulate a Markov chain which has the Dead Leaves model as equilibrium distribution. Algorithm 3.1 Forward Dead Leaves Algorithm We start with a space-time Boolean model as follows.

The references show how to construct an observable dominating process D, which will lie above the virtual simulation from time 1. <p> The sample eventually obtained will have the equilibrium distribution, since all relevant realisations of the target model are sandwiched between minimal and maximal process. If the acceptance rule for births produces an anti-monotone chain then 8 CFTP can still be applied with just a minor modification <ref> [9, 10] </ref>. <p> Hence the decision-rule for the acceptance of deaths is anti-monotone with respect to the set-inclusion order.

Reference-contexts: Simulations should incorporate this data by imposing adequate conditions on the Boolean model.

There is much to be done in the world of perfect simulation; however the variety of techniques already established augurs well for a bright and useful future!
