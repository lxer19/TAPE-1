Title: Well-Separated Pair Decomposition  
Author: CS . Ben Horowitz Rich Vuduc 
Date: November 10, 1997  
Abstract: We implemented the well-separated pair decomposition algorithm described by Callahan and Kosaraju [1]. We then tested the algorithm on a variety of point distributions in order to study the behavior of the number of interaction edges generated as a function of the separation constant s. We show that for s 1 the Kuzmin distribution generates a larger number of interaction edges than the other distributions tested. However, we find that the Kuzmin distribution exhibits asymptotically slower growth in the limit of large s. Finally, we consider other distributions, and speculate on how the structure of each accounts for the relative numbers of interaction edges generated.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We implemented the well-separated pair decomposition algorithm described by Callahan and Kosaraju <ref> [1] </ref> (hereafter, the CK algorithm). In summary, the algorithm works by constructing a fair split tree which is a partitioning of an initial point set, so that the number of interaction edges geenerated by traversing the tree is guaranteed to be a linear function of the number of points. <p> Our procedure was simply to first generate a random point p such that p lies within the unit circle (or unit-sphere, in 3-dimensions). Each of the cartesian components of p were uniformly 1 distributed in the interval <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. Then, a point q in the Kuzmin model can be computed by scaling p: q = jpj 1 where p; q are vectors from the origin to the points p; q respectively, and d is the dimension (2 or 3). <p> Figure 6 confirms the claim in the original paper <ref> [1] </ref> that the number of interaction edges grows linearly with the number of points in the data set for fixed values of the separation constant. <p> Furthermore, the number of interaction edges output by the CK algorithm appears to increase nearly linearly with the separation constant s for s in <ref> [1; 2] </ref>, as shown in fig. 7. We next performed runs on data sets of 10,000 points drawn from each of the distributions described in the previous section.
