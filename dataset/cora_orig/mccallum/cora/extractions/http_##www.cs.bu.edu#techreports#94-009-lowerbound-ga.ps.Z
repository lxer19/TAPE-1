Abstract: A lower-bound result on the power of Abstract This paper presents a lower-bound result on the computational power of a genetic algorithm in the context of combinatorial optimization. We describe a new genetic algorithm, the merged genetic algorithm, and prove that for the class of monotonic functions, the algorithm finds the optimal solution, and does so with an exponential convergence rate. The analysis pertains to the ideal behavior of the algorithm where the main task reduces to showing convergence of probability distributions over the search space of combinatorial structures to the optimal one. We take exponential convergence to be indicative of efficient solvability for the sample-bounded algorithm, although a sampling theory is needed to better relate the limit behavior to actual behavior. The paper concludes with a discussion of some immediate problems that lie ahead. a genetic algorithm

Reference-contexts: Even for function computation problems such as MAX-Clique, recent results in complexity theory have shown that approximating the size of the maximum clique is as hard as computing its exact value <ref> [1] </ref>. Hence attempting to prove most general results on the power of GA's will be as daunting as proving P 6= N P . <p> A symmetric argument, where we substitute u i for k in D i , shows E iu i &gt; D i .

Since h is continuous and 0 is the only left stationary point, p fl iv i = 0. <p> A symmetric argument, where we substitute u i for k in D i , shows E iu i &gt; D i .

A similar argument shows that lim t!1 p iu i (t) = 1. fl 7 Note, lemma 1 implies that all other probabilities except p iu i converge to 0.

Reference-contexts: Although less trivial than 1 and 2, the analysis is straightforward. Basically, it corresponds to "zooming in" via reproduction coupled with localized search through random perturbations. 4. Crossover alone. By no means trivial. The mixing properties of cross-over alone can be fruitfully analyzed using Markov chain techniques <ref> [4, 2, 6] </ref>. A recent result of [6] shows that under weak restrictions on the cross-over operator (symmetricity and aperiodicity), its stationary distribution is unique and easily characterizable. 5. Reproduction + cross-over. This seems to be the most interesting case.

Reference-contexts: Our result extends the class of functions efficiently solvable by a genetic algorithm (albeit nonstandard) to monotonic functions which, in some sense, are the simplest representant of the "building-block hypothesis" <ref> [3] </ref>. In technical considerations, the following points can be made regarding the difficulty of dealing with various aspects of genetic algorithms: 1. Mutation alone. Mutation by itself is easy to analyze. It corresponds to doing a random walk in the space of all combinatorial structures via local transitions. <p> Thus, for example, all multinomials in n variables with positive coefficients are monotonic. This includes the MAX-SUM function as a special case. Intuitively, monotonic functions should be good examplars of the "building-block hypothesis" <ref> [3] </ref> since the components of the function are maximally independent. Later we will exploit this property to show that this is indeed the case.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, since the sample size N needs to be of the same order of magnitude as jSj to adequately emulate T r , we cannot say that T r is an efficient procedure. Formalizations of efficient solvability and a corresponding sampling theory can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. For cross-over operator T c , P r fzjx; yg is a fixed quantity, hence T c induces a stationary stochastic process. <p> First, we prove that the above map is continuous (which is obvious for p fully supported) which is needed for a 5 later proof. The stronger property of local Lipschitz continuity is needed in the context of a sampling theory <ref> [5] </ref>, and is stated here for completeness. Proposition 1 Let jjp qjj 1 2m .

Reference-contexts: The algorithm combines reproduction and cross-over operations in a novel, but simple way, which makes its behavior amenable to rigorous mathematical analysis. A previous result of <ref> [7] </ref> has shown that the n-bit MAX-SUM function, x 1 + x 2 + : : : + x n , lies within the reach of a standard genetic algorithm that uses n-point cross-over. <p> Reproduction + cross-over. This seems to be the most interesting case. When crossover is combined with reproduction, tracking the behavior of a population becomes a 1 difficult task because reproduction tends to disrupt the homogenizing effect of cross-over. In <ref> [7] </ref>, a clever scheme of "jumping" across representations has made the analysis of the MAX-SUM function tractable. In this paper, a different approach is taken, whose main advantage lies in the "merging" of reproduction and cross-over in a new algorithm, whose behavior is more easily analyzable. 6.
