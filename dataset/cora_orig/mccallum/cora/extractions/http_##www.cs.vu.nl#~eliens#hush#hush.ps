Abstract: This article describes the C++ programmer interface to hush, the hyper utility shell based on Tcl/Tk. Tcl is a scripting language that may be embedded in C or C++. Tk is a window and graphics toolkit based on X11, with an associated interpreter called wish. The hush library contains classes that provide convenient yet flexible access to the functionality offered by the Tcl/Tk toolkit and its extensions. The library is intended to support the needs of both novice and experienced (window) programmers. It offers widget and graphics classes with an easy to use interface, but allows more experienced programmers also to employ the Tcl scripting language to define the behavior and functionality of widget and structured graphics objects. The design of the hush library has been inspired by the InterViews library. However, both the use of event callbacks and the functional interface of widget and graphics classes is significantly simpler. An important advantage of basing hush on the Tk toolkit is that existing Tk applications written for the Tk interpreter wish can easily be (re)used in a C++ context, virtually without any costs. On the other hand, programs employing hush may again be used as an enhanced version of the wish interpreter, allowing the functionality defined in the program to be used in a (hush) script.

Reference-contexts: Common practice is to write only a limited number of callback functions and perform explicit dispatching according to the type of event. An object oriented approach may be advantageous as a means to organize a collection of callback functions as member functions of a single class <ref> [Eliens95] </ref>. One way of doing this is to define an abstract event handler class which provides a virtual member function for each of the most commonly occurring events. In effect, such a handler class hides the dispatching according to the type of the event.

Reference-contexts: Part of the material presented here has been adapted from Principles of Object-Oriented Software Development by Anton Eliens, (c) 1995 Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. Inc. <ref> [LVC89] </ref>. However, despite the elegance of its design, InterViews is slightly cumbersome to use and lacks a number of the features and widgets needed for rapidly implementing a graphical user interface. Commercial packages for GUI (Graphical User Interface) programming in C++ are available.

Tcl was announced as a flexible cshell-like language, intended to be used for developing an X11-based toolkit. A year later, the Tk toolkit (based on Tcl) was presented in [Ousterhout91].

Reference-contexts: Commercial packages for GUI (Graphical User Interface) programming in C++ are available. The disadvantage of these packages, apart from their price, is primarily that they do not offer the flexibility needed in a research environment. A rather different approach to GUI programming has been advocated in <ref> [Ousterhout91] </ref>, which describes the Tcl/Tk toolkit. Tcl is a cshell-like (interpreted) script language that may be embedded in C or C++. Tk is a window and graphics toolkit based on X11, partly implemented in Tcl and partly in C. Tk offers numerous widgets, including a powerful canvas and text widget. <p> Tcl was announced as a flexible cshell-like language, intended to be used for developing an X11-based toolkit. A year later, the Tk toolkit (based on Tcl) was presented in <ref> [Ousterhout91] </ref>. From the start Tcl/Tk has received a lot of attention, since it provides a flexible and convenient way to develop rather powerful window applications. The Tcl language offers variables, assignment and a procedure construct.

Reference-contexts: In a similar way, the menu entry Save results in writing the canvas to a postscript file. (The code for checking whether the OK or CANCEL button is pressed is left as an exercise.) 6 Graphics and hypertext The Tk toolkit offers powerful facilities for graphics and (hyper)text.

Reference-contexts: As such, it offers the best of both worlds. Or the worst, for that matter. The material presented here requires at least some knowledge of C++. See for example [Stroustrup91]. Some familiarity with Tcl/Tk is also helpful. See <ref> [Ousterhout94] </ref>.

Structure In section 2, some background information concerning Tcl/Tk is given.
