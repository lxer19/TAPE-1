Reference-contexts: The path delays and path costs are shown along the edges of the closure graph. 2. In the second step, we construct a constrained minimum spanning tree T of G 0 (Fig. 2c). We use Prim's technique of constructing a minimum spanning tree <ref> [14] </ref>, with the following critical measure, c m , that determines which edge to add to the sub-tree at each iteration: c m = &gt; &gt; &lt; W (u;v) D 0 (u; v) &lt; D 1 otherwise closure.

Reference-contexts: We have also been considering other critical measures that may give rise to improved performance in the case of source routing <ref> [15] </ref>. That paper also presents optimal for various numbers of nodes distributed routing algorithms for solving this problem and discusses their performance. These distributed algorithms use information about adjacent nodes only,rather than requiring knowledge of the entire network topology.

Reference-contexts: Typically, audio data will need bandwidths between 64Kbits/sec and 1Mbit/sec, depending on the sound quality, and require an end-to-end delay of less than 100 msec [16]. Video data has an order of magnitude higher data rate, with about 30 to 50 msec delay tolerance <ref> [17] </ref>. Taking the cost on an edge to be a function of the bandwidth utilized, and the delay to be a sum of the switching and propagation delays, the CMT algorithm could be applied to generate multiparty connections for multimedia applications.

Reference-contexts: A solution given by A is exactly the solution for the Steiner tree problem. Thus, the optimal constrained multicast tree problem is NP-complete. This proof holds even for edge weights = 1, since the corresponding Steiner tree problem is NP-complete <ref> [18] </ref>.
