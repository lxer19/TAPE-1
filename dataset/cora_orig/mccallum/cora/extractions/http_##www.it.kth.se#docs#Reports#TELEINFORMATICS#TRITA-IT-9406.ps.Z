Reference-contexts: number of stations allowed in network, and lasers with high peak optical power are required to increase the number of stations [Bra90], [Bra91]. 1.2.1.2.2 Multihop Architecture The second WDMA model, the so-called multihop architecture, is used by several proposed networks such as the Manhattan Street Network (MSN) [Max85], the ShuffleNet <ref> [Aca87] </ref>, [HK91], Store-and-Forward With Integrated Frequency-Time (SWIFT) [CG87], the Lightnet [CGK88], and the Wavelength-Division Optical Network (WON) [Ban90]. A distributed topology is used, with a distributed temporal switching function, in which each station has access to a small number of fixed-wavelength transmitters and receivers (coarse WDM). <p> Additionally, there is no need for adaptive routing to compensate for variable traffic intensities and/or patterns as in networks based on the multihop concept <ref> [Aca87] </ref>, [CG87], [CGK88], [Ban90], [HK91]. Low latency and jitter can be provided in the transport of data, which is advantageous for services with strict time constraints, i.e., real-time traffic. <p> This is a combinatorial optimization problem that has been intensively investigated by the authors of WDMA networks based on the multihop concept <ref> [Aca87] </ref>, [CG87], [CGK88], [AK89], [Ban90], [HK91]. The proposed separation concept simplifies the solution for this problem.

Reference-contexts: Degradation caused by dispersion takes the form of intersymbol interference (ISI) in the received data stream and a degradation a of the SNR given by (4.19). Subsequent system penalty of the error performance, given by (4.20), must therefore be considered to compensate for this [Gow84], <ref> [Aca90] </ref>. Significant ISI happens when the pulse broadening t is larger than half the bit period (according to Figures 3-4 and 4-8), that is, t &gt; T. <p> The receiver sensitivity degrades rapidly in this case and, because of that, t = T is considered as a practical limit (so-called dispersion limit) in dimensioning the length of transmission [Gow84], [Lin89], <ref> [Aca90] </ref>. <p> DLW 4.27 ( ) T + t DLWR 1 4.28 ( ) 112 With the pulse shapes encountered in practical systems (Gaussian, Lorentzian, etc.), the condition of dispersion limit corresponds also to an additional power penalty of 3 dB added to the (theoretical) margin given by (4.23) or (4.24) [Gow84], <ref> [Aca90] </ref>. Furthermore, in an WDM multichannel system, the dispersion on fiber limits not only the (maximum) product RL (or R 2 L) between the rate per channel and the distance between stations, but also the maximum number of WDM channels.

Reference-contexts: The main difficulties of this solution are connected with the (optical) delay equalization needed to keep the optical pulses aligned in their proper time slots, a formidable task for pulses of tens and hundreds of picoseconds duration <ref> [AK89] </ref>, [JM93]. <p> These technological limitations greatly deteriorate the performance for WDU architectures (service bottleneck) and therefore restricts the area of applicability for (fast) packet switching services <ref> [AK89] </ref>, [Gre92]. Also, another bottleneck in WDU networks is because of congestion in the optical power domain given by the optical splitting in the case of passive central node. <p> Alternatively, different adaptive (self-routing) mechanisms can be used in the spectral domain (store-and-forward, hot-potato, etc.) to compensate for variable traffic intensities and/or patterns <ref> [AK89] </ref>, [Ban90], [AS92]. Nevertheless, such architectures are not advantageous for services with strict latency and jitter constraints (real-time traffic). Apart from the drawback of large delay variances [Ban90], [Ros92], these networks suffer also because of the need to reassemble the received data in a correct sequence, a time-and buffer-consuming process. <p> This is a combinatorial optimization problem that has been intensively investigated by the authors of WDMA networks based on the multihop concept [Aca87], [CG87], [CGK88], <ref> [AK89] </ref>, [Ban90], [HK91].

Reference-contexts: the number of stations [Bra90], [Bra91]. 1.2.1.2.2 Multihop Architecture The second WDMA model, the so-called multihop architecture, is used by several proposed networks such as the Manhattan Street Network (MSN) [Max85], the ShuffleNet [Aca87], [HK91], Store-and-Forward With Integrated Frequency-Time (SWIFT) [CG87], the Lightnet [CGK88], and the Wavelength-Division Optical Network (WON) <ref> [Ban90] </ref>.

Nevertheless, such architectures are not advantageous for services with strict latency and jitter constraints (real-time traffic). Apart from the drawback of large delay variances [Ban90], [Ros92], these networks suffer also because of the need to reassemble the received data in a correct sequence, a time-and buffer-consuming process. Furthermore, since a packet goes through intermediate nodes (i.e., multiple hops) before reaching the destination node, network (bandwidth) resource is wasted. This poses difficult problems of routing. <p> Additionally, there is no need for adaptive routing to compensate for variable traffic intensities and/or patterns as in networks based on the multihop concept [Aca87], [CG87], [CGK88], <ref> [Ban90] </ref>, [HK91]. Low latency and jitter can be provided in the transport of data, which is advantageous for services with strict time constraints, i.e., real-time traffic. <p> Thus, appropriate topologies must be designated according to latency performance of interest for different applications. Generally, the problem of determining the optimal physical topology should be differentiated from the problem of determining the optimal virtual topology <ref> [Ban90] </ref>. The optimal physical topology is decided on the basis of minimization the cost of optical network, as reflected by the total length of optical fiber. It is the determination of virtual (logical) topology that has a decisive impact on the (mean) propagation delay. <p> This is a combinatorial optimization problem that has been intensively investigated by the authors of WDMA networks based on the multihop concept [Aca87], [CG87], [CGK88], [AK89], <ref> [Ban90] </ref>, [HK91]. The proposed separation concept simplifies the solution for this problem.

Reference-contexts: Appropriate (design) solutions must therefore be chosen, according to these limits, to provide these requirements. 4.3 Quantum Limit In ideal optical transmission systems, the fundamental performance limitation is governed by photon statistics that is usually referred to as quantum noise [Per73a], [Per73b], <ref> [Bar76] </ref>, [MS76]. This noise arises from the random nature of photons arrival and absorption at the optical detector (Fig. 4-1). Exactly when in time the photons are detected by the photodetector is random. <p> and different p 0 i and p 1 i , the solution is given by Furthermore, assuming an optical received power P r and an ideal shaping (i.e., low-pass) filter with bandwidth b f at the reception, the signal-to-noise ratio a PIN for a PIN receiver can be calculated with <ref> [Bar76] </ref> where q is the electronic charge; h is the quantum efficiency of the photodetector; h is the constant of Planck; and n is the optical frequency. <p> The signal-to-noise ratio a APD of a direct detection system using an APD with gain (i.e., multiplication factor) g n and dark current I d is given by <ref> [Bar76] </ref>, [NI91] where F (g n ) is an excess noise due to the randomness of the multiplication. To provide an error rate P e i of 10 -9 , a signal-to-noise ratio a = 12 (i.e., 21.6 dB) is required.

Reference-contexts: Increasing the network bandwidth B w for such networks would require fundamental technological improvements, such as increasing the optical transmitted power and/or the receiver sensitivities at high bit rates <ref> [BB85] </ref>, [Bra90]. The focus, therefore, will be on physical topologies based on point-to-point interconnections. The network architecture is composed in this case by a number of stations connected by point-to-point optical fibers. Unidirectional or bidirectional links can be used for station-to-station interconnection. <p> One can also take advantage of the coherence properties of light and use coherent systems with a sensitivity of about 10 dB better than direct detection systems <ref> [BB85] </ref>. These systems perform even better than comparable direct detection systems with optical preamplifiers [NI91]. Such techniques are, however, not taken into consideration here due to such serious drawbacks as complexity and large costs [GR90].

Reference-contexts: The mux/demux can be implemented by means of Sibipolar or GaAs MESFET gates and delay lines, as described in <ref> [BBT+82] </ref>, [BE85], [KYS+89], [OYE+90], [HMM+91].

These values are much larger than the power-budget margin a of 16 dB (subsection 4.5.7). Accordingly, negligible jitter peaks of 10 psec or less are obtainable for this clock signal. However, the static phase offset is difficult to set and may be temperature dependent.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, additional requirements such as increased flexibility, security, affordability and optimum use of network resources must be fulfilled as well. Today, new multi-Gbit/s optical integrated networks, which carry simultaneously diverse real-time synchronous traffic, intra-system traffic with stringent latency requirements, and inter-system traffic, are under development <ref> [BCF+92] </ref>, [Che92], [Gre92], [KBH+92], [Kun92], [Tol92]. However, while the Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technique has further manifoldly increased the transmission capacity on optical fiber [Bra90], the performance increase of supporting nodal electronics and (software) processing needed for switching, buffering and control purposes has not matched this trend.

Reference-contexts: However, the static phase offset is difficult to set and may be temperature dependent. With tolerances for temperature, voltage and diverse components, the frequency of Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO) in PLL can deviate up to - 10% from the reference clock frequency <ref> [BCK+83] </ref>, [KMM83]. To assure that the sampling of the received data bits occurs at the most optimum time instant in the slot period, a variable delay line or some electronic phase shifting circuit may be used for an optimum phase deviation of the clock cl_rc_x.

Typical examples of demultiplexer and multiplexer are shown in Figs. 4-5 and 4-6. <p> There are two methods to compensate for these errors: by changing the density of bits within a frame or slot, i.e., buffering data at one or more nodes [LGH+85]; or by altering the slot/frame rate, i.e., socalled slot/frame stretching/shrinking technique <ref> [BE85] </ref>. The first method means that the PHY at one or more nodes must include an elastic buffer to accumulate bits and the data stream must contain a special idle bit field, where this buffer is allowed to be recentered, with the effect of adding or deleting idle bits. <p> Also, it is quite resistant to failures. An alternative to the previous approach is given by the slot, or frame, stretching/shrinking method, by which phase and frequency synchronism is achieved by skewing the network clock instead of data bits. This technique becomes practically feasible only at high data rates <ref> [BE85] </ref>. It has the big advantage that the PLL device locks to the low slot or frame rate instead of the high bit rate, and this is done at the expense of control and hardware sophistication. <p> Assuming the case of zero static phase offset in PLL, signal-to-noise ratios b rc of about 50 dB or more can be provided for the receive clock signal cl_rc_x on the regeneration section, also shown in [BBT+82], <ref> [BE85] </ref>, [TS87].

Reference-contexts: Modeling the entering traffic as a stochastic process is often intractable for realistic models <ref> [BG87] </ref>. Moreover, the complicated way in which different traffic streams "interact" with each other, with correlated (packet) arrival processes at different nodes [Hui90], heavily complicates the issue of guaranteeing the requested QoS for all subclasses of traffic. <p> Taking expectations of the above-mentioned times, we have: where: the average waiting time in the queue Q OST4 at the ordinary station can be calculated with the formula for a low priority queue in a HOL non-preemptive M/D/1 model [HO86], <ref> [BG87] </ref> iso [ ] E W AOS iso 2 E T D iso [ ] E W QMSR iso [ ] T MS iso E W QMST iso [ ] E W SYNC iso [ ] 5.15 ( )+ + + + + + += iso [ ] iso m ctr <p> the parameter (3/2) m ctr iso is the service time of server S 0 iso,rec or S i the processing time in the master station is captured by the average waiting time in the queue Q MSR2 at the master station is calculated with the formula for M/D/1 model [HO86], <ref> [BG87] </ref> L iso l i i 1= 5.20 ( )= iso m ctr E T D 2 iso 3 m ctr 2 2 iso 5.22 ( )= = iso a iso m ctr E W QMSR iso [ ] 2 iso ( ) 2 1 L iso a iso m ctr <p> The component delays of the end-to-end delay T k,ee niso are calculated as follows: the queueing delay W QOS niso,k has expectation and variance that can be calculated with the formulas for the first two moments for an arbitrary priority queue in a HOL non-pre emptive M/D/1 model [Lav83], [DeMR84], <ref> [BG87] </ref> Var T k mac, niso [ ] s k mac, 2 2 5.61 ( )= = niso k, [ ] l k i, niso k 1= niso ( ) 2 2 1 l x i, niso x 1= m ctr niso - 1 l x i, niso x 1= niso <p> )= E W SYNC niso [ ] b niso 1+( ) F 1 serv 2 214 The access time W DAOS niso,k has expectation and variance that can be calculated with the formulas for the first two moments for an arbitrary priority queue in a HOL preemptive M/G/1 model [Lav83], <ref> [BG87] </ref>, [DeM90] E W DAOS niso k, [ ] m data niso k, 1 2 niso m data niso x, x 1= - 2 niso m data niso x, ( ) 2 x 1= n l x i, niso m data niso x, x 1= - 1 2 niso m data

Reference-contexts: Mechanisms like Forward Error Correction (FEC) are useful in high speed networks with large bandwidth-delay products, although they are computational intensive <ref> [Bie92] </ref>. Another useful approach (which is a degenerate form of FEC) is to simply transmit two (or more) copies of the data on distinct channels and to choose the uncorrupted data without requiring error correction (Fig. 2-16).

Reference-contexts: Unidirectional or bidirectional links can be used for station-to-station interconnection. In the last case, link differentiation can be done either in wavelength domain (single fiber) or in space domain (two distinct fibers). Also, the network topology can be regular or irregular. Given their advantages [Sta87], <ref> [BL92] </ref>, ring-based architectures will be considered in our study. These are attractive mainly because of their distributed structure, flexibility, trivial routing, (relative) simple control mechanisms, fairness, etc. Also, different (hybrid) physical topologies, e.g., star-ring, are of interest when considering the reduction of propagation delay for time-critical applications. <p> Furthermore, there are also other schemes of register-insertion ring partitioning, with higher degree of parallelism, that are able to provide throughput improvements as large as 2.67 times the capacity of a link, and even 3 (in the case of small number of stations) <ref> [BL92] </ref>. Such analysis is, however, beyond the scope of this thesis, and is left to the future. The assumptions used in this analysis are: Static policies of type complete resource partitioning are used for resource partitioning in the w_niso_c channel among the n stations.

Reference-contexts: The operation of the (L i , D i , T i ) Traffic Policer, used for nonisochronous traffic, is in principle very similar to the so-called Leaky Bucket method used as bandwidth enforcement mechanism for ATM networks [Tur86], <ref> [BLM87] </ref>, [Tur87]. Two counters are maintained for a given traffic stream/ packet entering the station. Each time a packet/data is offered, the contents of these counters are compared to some specific thresholds. If the both counters are below these thresholds, the packet is admitted and the counters are incremented. <p> This is because here the required performance can only be statistically guaranteed, and because of fairness problems in the case of congestion [HS91]. On the other hand, policing/shaping procedures (such as Leaky Bucket <ref> [BLM87] </ref>, [Tur87]), used to assure that any change in the behavior of traffic source does not affect the other users (fairness criteria), are advantageous, since they guarantee traffic parameters on which statistical multiplexing can be done.

Reference-contexts: Today, new multi-Gbit/s optical integrated networks, which carry simultaneously diverse real-time synchronous traffic, intra-system traffic with stringent latency requirements, and inter-system traffic, are under development [BCF+92], [Che92], [Gre92], [KBH+92], [Kun92], [Tol92]. However, while the Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technique has further manifoldly increased the transmission capacity on optical fiber <ref> [Bra90] </ref>, the performance increase of supporting nodal electronics and (software) processing needed for switching, buffering and control purposes has not matched this trend. The performance bottleneck has therefore shifted from the transmission channel to network nodes [DFM+91], [Gre91], [Kle92]. <p> path (such as guided-wave and free-space optics) are still in the laboratory phase, and they still need to have their performance improved [Hin92]. 6 1.2.1.2 Multiwavelength Optical Networks The best architectural models for utilizing the large bandwidth resource available on optical fiber are those based on Wavelength Division Multi-Access (WDMA) <ref> [Bra90] </ref>, [Gre91]. In such architectures (Fig. 1-3), multiple optical channels spaced apart in the spectral domain are used to provide switchable interconnections between any two users. Generally, the stations have one or more electro-optical interface (s), and these networks can be broadly classified as using wavelength agility or not. <p> Neither tunable lasers nor tunable filters are commercially available today that are capable of retuning speeds consistent with the packet/cell switching requirements (i.e., microseconds and less) over a sizable optical spectrum and for a large number of users [TIN86], [KC89], [LZ89], <ref> [Bra90] </ref>, [Ram93]. Nor are they likely to be available in the near future, since such technological breakthroughs are well beyond the current state of the art of lightwave technology [Bra90]. <p> switching requirements (i.e., microseconds and less) over a sizable optical spectrum and for a large number of users [TIN86], [KC89], [LZ89], <ref> [Bra90] </ref>, [Ram93]. Nor are they likely to be available in the near future, since such technological breakthroughs are well beyond the current state of the art of lightwave technology [Bra90]. These technological limitations greatly deteriorate the performance for WDU architectures (service bottleneck) and therefore restricts the area of applicability for (fast) packet switching services [AK89], [Gre92]. <p> This limits the maximum number of stations allowed in network, and lasers with high peak optical power are required to increase the number of stations <ref> [Bra90] </ref>, [Bra91]. 1.2.1.2.2 Multihop Architecture The second WDMA model, the so-called multihop architecture, is used by several proposed networks such as the Manhattan Street Network (MSN) [Max85], the ShuffleNet [Aca87], [HK91], Store-and-Forward With Integrated Frequency-Time (SWIFT) [CG87], the Lightnet [CGK88], and the Wavelength-Division Optical Network (WON) [Ban90]. <p> The technique of (self-routing) fast packet switching used in ATM is not consistent with most actual WDMA architectures. The needed wavelength-agility, for instance, is currently beyond the state of the art <ref> [Bra90] </ref>. Additionally, the switch throughput is fundamentally limited in the ATM case by the limited capacity available in the control channel (within the switch) and not by technological limitations on optical networks such as power-budget or dispersion [Hen89], [Bra91]. Technological breakthroughs are needed in switch implementation to alleviate this bottleneck. <p> Also, another factor limiting the performance is connected with multicast service requirements. This drawback, which is specific for such architectures, refers to the difficulties in solving the (possible) contention when multiple packets, from a number of transmitters, must be simultaneously transmitted to the same receiver <ref> [Bra90] </ref>. One of the most interesting experiments, the STARNET architecture, is reported in [PG91]. This is a hybrid multichannel optical network implemented on a passive star topology. It provides support for both high-speed (100 Mbit/s) packet-switching applications and multi-Gbit/s (3 Gbit/s) circuit-switching interconnections. <p> With the current technology, optical fiber is inherently a point-to-point medium since it is still very difficult to provide a large number of access points, such as in a multipoint system, without unacceptable (power) losses <ref> [Bra90] </ref>. In an optical LAN, efficiency in utilization of optical energy is usually a dominant consideration. Because of the power limitation in optical domain (and, consequently, reduced network bandwidth), physical topologies using passive couplers/taps such as bus, tree or star are generally not good candidates [Hen89], [Haa92]. <p> Increasing the network bandwidth B w for such networks would require fundamental technological improvements, such as increasing the optical transmitted power and/or the receiver sensitivities at high bit rates [BB85], <ref> [Bra90] </ref>. The focus, therefore, will be on physical topologies based on point-to-point interconnections. The network architecture is composed in this case by a number of stations connected by point-to-point optical fibers. Unidirectional or bidirectional links can be used for station-to-station interconnection. <p> This means that about 8000 photons/bit (or an average of 4000 photons in a binary interval) are provided at reception for a power-budget limit of 19 dB. This is greater than the figures required by the available photodiode devices as mentioned in <ref> [Bra90] </ref>, [Tos90], [CB91]. 114 Assuming that a large margin of 10 dB is left for wavelength mux/demux and other unaccounted losses (coupling, etc.), a loss budget of 9 dB will be left for the dispersion limit degradation (i.e., 3 dB) and for the optical fiber link loss.

Reference-contexts: This limits the maximum number of stations allowed in network, and lasers with high peak optical power are required to increase the number of stations [Bra90], <ref> [Bra91] </ref>. 1.2.1.2.2 Multihop Architecture The second WDMA model, the so-called multihop architecture, is used by several proposed networks such as the Manhattan Street Network (MSN) [Max85], the ShuffleNet [Aca87], [HK91], Store-and-Forward With Integrated Frequency-Time (SWIFT) [CG87], the Lightnet [CGK88], and the Wavelength-Division Optical Network (WON) [Ban90]. <p> Additionally, the switch throughput is fundamentally limited in the ATM case by the limited capacity available in the control channel (within the switch) and not by technological limitations on optical networks such as power-budget or dispersion [Hen89], <ref> [Bra91] </ref>.

Thus, there is a definite need for novel ways of dealing with the conflict between the heterogeneity and the performance (needs) of application traffic.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the differentiation of w_niso_c control channel from w_niso_d data channel, together with the preemptive policy used in servicing diverse messages in w_niso_d, as well as the buffer insertion ring configuration used, reduces the clustering process (i.e., increased variability) in the interarrival times of packets/messages <ref> [BS83] </ref>, [PY91]. Instead, it is now the service (i.e., transport) completion times that may get prolonged, i.e., we may get an increased variability (up to a limit given by the service frame F k serv ) in the service completion times.

Reference-contexts: in optical domain. 1.2.1.1.1 TDM in Electrical Domain This solution is used by most actual monowavelength systems such as the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) [FDD87], the FDDI Follow-On (FFOL) [LR91], the Distributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB) [DQD88], the High-Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) [Tol92], and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) <ref> [BS91] </ref> in combination with the Synchronous Optical Network E O E O Monowavelength Optical Network Station Station Station Station 21 w w E/O: electro-optic interface 5 (SONET) [Che92]. These systems are of architectures that do not take advantage of the lightwave technology capabilities. <p> Furthermore, the alternative solution of using large packet/cell sizes is not advantageous either, because it exacerbates the service bottleneck when integrating various types of traffic into the same data stream. Large packet/cell sizes are not advantageous for carrying mixed broadband traffic with different characteristics <ref> [BS91] </ref>, [DJ92]. The question of the precise practical limit of such electro-optic interfaces is therefore still open, but it currently appears very difficult to extend the bit rate beyond 2.4 Gbit/s [Kle92], [Kun92], [McE92], [MC93], [TS93]. <p> So the understanding of application requirements is a prerequisite for the proper design of future high-performance networks. Generally, the incoming traffic can be divided into two main classes, isochronous (real-time) and nonisochronous (non real-time) , each with distinct performance requirements [GRV90], [RB90], <ref> [BS91] </ref>, [RD91b]. Isochronous traffic generally includes Continuous Bit Rate (CBR) traffic and Variable Bit Rate (VBR) of continuous type, e.g., VBR video traffic. In contrast, nonisochro-nous traffic sources generate intermittent traffic and usually alternate between active and inactive periods. <p> functions, such as flow control and error recovery, to the edge of the network (with the result of conflicting the fundamental principle for supporting statistical multiplexing and CBR, which requires that elaborate congestion and rate-control schemes be executed on a real-time basis inside the network, and not at the edge) <ref> [BS91] </ref>, [HS91], [VS91], [DJ92], [Lea92]. One of the most important research issues in ATM is related to the characterization of the arrival process for bursty traffic, which is still an open issue. <p> Actually, there is no agreed definition for the burstiness of such a traffic and, accordingly, different traffic descriptors may be used that are based on diverse parameters (peak bit rate, average bit rate, bit rate variance, squared coefficient of the interarrival times, etc.) [KS90], <ref> [BS91] </ref>. Examples of models used in the characterization of diverse arrival processes are MMPP, renewal process, n-superposed IPP, etc. [KS90]. Furthermore, an uncontrolled access for additional traffic of all kinds may overload the network (bandwidth and processing) resources to the extent of performance degradation for already supported traffic. <p> These advantages (expressed in terms of service flexibility and network efficiency) do not justify the increased complexity of the (distributed) protocol processing, congestion control and switching. The service bottleneck is consequently exacerbated, as it is very difficult to guarantee requested QoS for all traffic classes [CP90], <ref> [BS91] </ref>, [Gre92]. We ignore other alternatives, like common resources in code domain, because of their poor 36 ness in terms of spectral efficiency, which results in low throughput performance [Sal89]. <p> Because of the large bandwidth-delay products in a multigigabit network, resource allocation mechanisms that are optimal over time and fair to all traffic classes are extremely hard to achieve in the case of common resource pools <ref> [BS91] </ref>, [LP91], [RD91b]. Control mechanisms based on reactive (adaptive feedback) algorithms operating within the network under very hard temporal constraints (decided according to performance needs of applications and architectural solutions for network), are required in this case. Such mechanisms are not suitable for broadband networks [Jai90a].

Reference-contexts: The protocols (medium access and transport) should also be simple and flexible, with adjustable parameters for minimum processing delay. Admission control mechanisms acting at a burst level (fast reservation schemes) should be used. The error recovery schemes should work on an edge-to-edge or network basis <ref> [BSW91] </ref>. The flow control protocols should work on a preventive basis and be entirely dedicated to applications [MElZ90]. 1.2.2.3 Transport Mechanisms Ideally, "uniform control mechanisms" should be applied to the transport across the optical media. <p> Given the large bandwidth-delay products existent in a high speed network, we consider that retransmission-based correction schemes are not advantageous for our purposes. Furthermore, network architectures that employ strict error handling/correction mechanisms between adjacent stations are not suitable for high speed networks as the processing overhead is increased <ref> [BSW91] </ref>. On the other hand, the traditional end-to-end error recovery schemes, using out-of-date estimates of network state (by at least one round trip latency) to make error/loss decisions, no longer suffices in networks with large bandwidth-delay products because of their inefficiency [FB90].

Finally, future computing environments based on parallel-processing supercomputers require better solutions for multigigabit photonic interconnects with (throughput) performances limited by optics, and not by electronics [SBR92], [VDK92]. A Wavelength Division Multi-Access (WDMA) architecture is considered in design that is based on the Wavelength-Dedicated-to-Application (WDA) concept.

The emerging services are of various types for multi-media (voice, video and/or data), multi-rate and multi-point communications [Lid90], [WT90].

Reference-contexts: shown in Fig. 4-4, the received cl_tr clock signal is passed through a PIN diode, a preamplifier and an AGC amplifier and, finally, filtered (quartz-crystal filtration) by a high quality factor (Q) bandpass filter (BPF) with sufficiently narrow loop bandwidth, such as the resulting phase error is approximately stationary [GF75], <ref> [CG86] </ref>. A regeneration function is used to eliminate noise accumulation in w_cl. Also, to guarantee fast and reliable frequency acquisition as well as fault protection, a frequency-sensitive detector together with a local oscillator may also be used. <p> Very low values for phase jitter (less than 10 psec) are easily obtainable in the case of large signal-to-noise ratio, i.e., and values for B L that are typically 10 -2 to 10 -4 of the clock frequency of 100 Mhz <ref> [CG86] </ref>, [MPM86].

To sustain 1 Gbit/s throughput, for instance, the station must process packets at a rate of 10,000 packets per second for (long) packets of 100 kbits length, and this figure approaches the actual limit for transport protocol processing rates [NRS90]. <p> The overall effects are significant bandwidth waste and a degrading of network throughput and latency <ref> [DDK+90] </ref>, [DJ92]. Moreover, the increased ratio of processing time to cell/packet transmission time makes it extremely difficult to implement node-by-node control schemes. <p> Key issues related to the efficient implementation of protocols, such as shortening the length of the instruction path, minimum possible memory moves (so-called single-copy architectures), low-over 14 head process structures (i.e., modification of the protocol syntax), minimum number of calls to the operating system, etc., must be addressed as well <ref> [DDK+90] </ref>, [LaPS91], [MS92], [BP93], [DAP+93], [DWB+93]. <p> Therefore, minimizing the impact of the control mechanisms on the user performance is an important consideration in network design. There are two choices for the transport of control information. The control stream can be transmitted either in-band with the data stream, or out-of-band <ref> [DDK+90] </ref>, [Fel90]. In the first case, the control stream is multiplexed with the data stream on the same data format (e.g., packet/ cell). <p> Though the control functions usually react on time scales larger than those given by packet (or cell) sizes. This feature is not desirable in a multigigabit environment (processing bottleneck problems) <ref> [DDK+90] </ref>, [LaPS91], [DJ92]. 38 We consider, therefore, that an appropriate solution for very high speed networks is given by decoupling the transport of data traffic from the transport of control traffic, together with provision of requested synchronization facilities. <p> They must do whatever necessary to compensate diverse imperfections of the underlying transport network up to the level required by the QoS imposed by users. The objective is to guarantee reliable data delivery to users, i.e., data should be delivered error-free, insequence and in complete/recognizable form <ref> [DDK+90] </ref>. Usually implemented in software, the transport protocol may require a large amount of processing and easily become the performance bottleneck at gigabit communications. The advent of photonic technology offering increasing transmission capacity at decreasing error rates have had a profound impact on the design of transport protocols [DDK+90], [LaPS91], [DJ92]. <p> complete/recognizable form <ref> [DDK+90] </ref>.

The advent of photonic technology offering increasing transmission capacity at decreasing error rates have had a profound impact on the design of transport protocols [DDK+90], [LaPS91], [DJ92]. Large bandwidth-delay products and very low error rates (10 -9 and less) mean that streamlined mechanisms operating on an end-user basis are needed to avoid the processing bottleneck and to allow high rate (best-effort) services. <p> Lightwave protocols, with minimum overhead to minimize the processing for steady-state situation, are desirable in high speed environments <ref> [DDK+90] </ref>, [LaPS91]. On the other hand, there is a fundamental conflict between this and the need for additional functionality that must be provided for efficient recovery from errors and failures [FB90], [DJ92]. <p> The window must be opened in this case to such an extend, that most (computer) messages can fit into one window. Effective flow control cannot, therefore, be achieved in this case <ref> [DDK+90] </ref>, [LaPS91]. 53 Rate-based flow control mechanisms are proposed in the literature as an alternative solution to generate a smoother transmission pattern, to the benefit of transport network and users [DDK+90], [LaPS91], [TF93]. <p> Effective flow control cannot, therefore, be achieved in this case <ref> [DDK+90] </ref>, [LaPS91]. 53 Rate-based flow control mechanisms are proposed in the literature as an alternative solution to generate a smoother transmission pattern, to the benefit of transport network and users [DDK+90], [LaPS91], [TF93]. Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that such a control mechanism is not faster than the window-based mechanism (because of its reactive nature). We consider that an appropriate solution for end-to-end flow control in a multigigabit environment (with focus on latency) is a preventive one.

Reference-contexts: Such mechanisms are not suitable for broadband networks [Jai90a]. Furthermore, alternative solutions based on using (traffic) prediction capabilities are not advantageous either, because of the complexity of bursty traffic. The main problem is connected here with the low degree of correlation existent in the bursty traffic generated by user <ref> [DeS91] </ref>. We believe that there is no need to use sophisticated (universal) control mechanisms that work under very hard time constraints, because the available bandwidth resource is huge.

Reference-contexts: The performance bottleneck has therefore shifted from the transmission channel to network nodes <ref> [DFM+91] </ref>, [Gre91], [Kle92].

For example, we believe that the ATM format (53 bytes) is too restrictive in opening up the service and processing bottlenecks. <p> Furthermore, in order to implement an efficient pipelined communication model, the host should see the network as a message-passing system, or as a memory <ref> [DFM+91] </ref>. It should not be dependent/aware of the underlying switching system. That is, the data formats used in multiplexing and switching should be separated from the data formats seen by host at the host interface or, if possible, same formats should be used.

Reference-contexts: Wavelength-agile components are used for switching. Examples of such architectures are the Fast Optical Cross-connect (FOX), the Hypass and Bhypass Switches, the Photonic Knockout Switch [Goo89], the StarTrack Switch [LGA90], Rainbow <ref> [DGL+90] </ref>, and others [HKS87], [Meh90], [SGK91], [SBD92]. This architecture presents, however, fundamental difficulties when using distributed control [Ram93]. Typically, a star topology is used, with a central passive node to and from which all communication take place. <p> However, wavelength-agile components are still used. Also, the solution advanced for the packetswitching services (ATM transport form in combination with multihop architecture) is not advantageous for delay- and jitter-critical (computer) communications. The RAINBOW network <ref> [DGL+90] </ref>, [Gre92] provides, perhaps, the best example of service bottleneck in multigigabit environments. An WDMA architecture of type WDU is used with fixed frequency optical transmitters and tunable optical receivers. A passive star topology is used. <p> For instance, there is no need for wavelength agility as in other multiwavelength optical networks based on the wavelength-dedicated-to-user (WDU) concept <ref> [DGL+90] </ref>, [LGA90], [Meh90], [SGK91], [SBD92]. This greatly enlarges the area of applicability by opening up the service bottleneck. Fast packet switching services can be easily provided in this case without the need for technological breakthroughs, such as fast wavelength-agile components used at the electro-optic interface.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the alternative solution of using large packet/cell sizes is not advantageous either, because it exacerbates the service bottleneck when integrating various types of traffic into the same data stream. Large packet/cell sizes are not advantageous for carrying mixed broadband traffic with different characteristics [BS91], <ref> [DJ92] </ref>. The question of the precise practical limit of such electro-optic interfaces is therefore still open, but it currently appears very difficult to extend the bit rate beyond 2.4 Gbit/s [Kle92], [Kun92], [McE92], [MC93], [TS93]. <p> flow control and error recovery, to the edge of the network (with the result of conflicting the fundamental principle for supporting statistical multiplexing and CBR, which requires that elaborate congestion and rate-control schemes be executed on a real-time basis inside the network, and not at the edge) [BS91], [HS91], [VS91], <ref> [DJ92] </ref>, [Lea92]. One of the most important research issues in ATM is related to the characterization of the arrival process for bursty traffic, which is still an open issue. <p> The 13 processing involved here by the end-to-end protocols (and associated code) in different OSI layers is not keeping pace with the actual multi-Gbit/s rates on optical fibers [DDK+90], [MElZ90], <ref> [DJ92] </ref>. To sustain 1 Gbit/s throughput, for instance, the station must process packets at a rate of 10,000 packets per second for (long) packets of 100 kbits length, and this figure approaches the actual limit for transport protocol processing rates [NRS90]. <p> The overall effects are significant bandwidth waste and a degrading of network throughput and latency [DDK+90], <ref> [DJ92] </ref>.

The fundamental issue of the dominance of propagation delay in the face of very high transport speeds and highly bursty traffic, with diverse characteristics, means that reactive (adaptive feedback) control algorithms are not suitable for broadband networks [HS91], [Kle92], [YM92]. <p> Large packet sizes are not advantageous for carrying mixed (broadband) traffic with different characteristics <ref> [DJ92] </ref>. An alternative solution can also be to switch on packet groups, but this has the drawback of less switching flexibility. Based on the separation concept, the solution of choice for switching is greatly simplified in our case. <p> Usually implemented in software, the transport protocol may require a large amount of processing and easily become the performance bottleneck at gigabit communications. The advent of photonic technology offering increasing transmission capacity at decreasing error rates have had a profound impact on the design of transport protocols [DDK+90], [LaPS91], <ref> [DJ92] </ref>.

Another critical function that is affected by the large bandwidth-delay product in a multigi-gabit network is the mechanism for connection setup and release, whether of type handshake (for applications with high throughput) or implicit/timer-based (for applications with low throughput and/or low delay requirements).

However, this is a solution where noise enhancement occurs. A specific trade-off must therefore be chosen between reduced ISI and noise enhancement [Per81].

Reference-contexts: For example, we believe that the ATM format (53 bytes) is too restrictive in opening up the service and processing bottlenecks. This format, which has been chosen to reduce the (queueing) delays and to facilitate switch development <ref> [Fel90] </ref>, is not consistent with the sizes of application data objects, and this poses extra burden on (protocol) processing. <p> Therefore, minimizing the impact of the control mechanisms on the user performance is an important consideration in network design. There are two choices for the transport of control information. The control stream can be transmitted either in-band with the data stream, or out-of-band [DDK+90], <ref> [Fel90] </ref>. In the first case, the control stream is multiplexed with the data stream on the same data format (e.g., packet/ cell). In the second case, the control stream and the data stream are transmitted on separate associations, in time or in frequency/wavelength (e.g., different time slots/frames or different wavelengths).

Reference-contexts: do you need?; How much real-time communication do you need?; and How reliable communication do you need? Here, we define real-time (communication) services as those services where the clients specify (among others) their performance requirements in terms of delay and jitter, and obtain guarantees about the fulfillment of these requirements <ref> [Fer90] </ref>. Also, the clients are requested to specify, together with their communication requirements, the characteristics of the expected input traffic. For instance, a client in a distributed computing environment may create several tasks, distribute them among several servers, and collect then the responses. <p> A priority structure is created among these traffic subclasses. For instance, the most stringent needs are met in the case of distributed computation models, where the transmission of short messages is more crucial to the performance than the transmission of long messages <ref> [Fer90] </ref>, [WTS92]. Fairness is enforced, in this case, by ordering the nonisochronous applications according to their admissible latencies. Furthermore, a dynamic resourcesharing mechanism is used to allocate the w_niso_d resources to different subclasses of nonisochronous traffic. Within a single subclass, fairness is provided on a First-Come-First-Served (FIFS) basis.

Furthermore, increased network speeds means that the ratio of peak and average rates in a LAN environment is very likely to increase, and traffic is expected to become even more bursty.

Reference-contexts: On the contrary, low b values mean that the timing jitter (random and systematic) -- due to the combined action of data stream randomness (self-noise) <ref> [Gar80] </ref>, linear distortions of the signal (ISI), imperfections of the retiming circuit and noise in the channel (thermal and shot) - has values approaching the pulse interval. In this case, the error performance depends mainly on the retiming/synchronization solution. <p> Systematic jitter includes two components, namely, the Duty Cycle Distortion Jitter (DCDJ) and the Data Dependent Jitter (DDJ) [Han90]. The first component is mainly caused by asymmetries of rise/fall times in the received pulses. On the other hand, the DDJ, also referred to as self-noise <ref> [Gar80] </ref>, occurs because of the random nature of the data itself and different imperfections of the (nonlinear) retiming device, such as bandwidth limitations, (inherent) phase deviation/modulation in the recovered clock signal, etc.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, to compensate for the increased ratio of propagation delay to cell/packet transmission time, some form of structural and/or functional parallelism (or pipelining) must be used in processing the different protocols and/or data structures involved in a communication process [Zit91], <ref> [GNI92] </ref>, [Kle92], [ITN93]. 1.3 Solution Approach The fundamental shift in technologies and their tradeoff forces us to consider new alternative approaches to the integrated multi-Gbit/s communication over multiwavelength optical networks. <p> Three levels of parallelism are generally identified for a communication process, which are given by the degree of granularity (i.e., coarse grain, medium grain and fine grain) used when introducing parallelism into protocol processing [JSB90], [Haa91], [Zit91], <ref> [GNI92] </ref>. 26 Typically, coarse grain processing involves high-level functions or tasks assigned to individual processors such as, for instance, in the case of connection-dedicated-to-processor approach. <p> This is similar in fact to increasing the processing power (for transport protocol) in the abovementioned layer-pipeline model. Performance improvements are obtained, regardless of traffic intensity, pattern or distribution over connections [JSB90], <ref> [GNI92] </ref>, [TW92]. However, careful implementation of the protocol is required because of the inherent sequentiality of packets in the data stream. Sophisticated solutions are required to cope with diverse error and fault conditions [JSB90]. <p> Extra facilities (e.g., synchronization and mutual exclusion) are required in this case to compensate for undesirable parallelism when more than one processor are contending for access to shared data in the control information <ref> [GNI92] </ref>. Finally, it must be pointed out that this solution still does not make use of functional parallelism in the communication process, because the layer-pipeline model is still used for communication.

Also, a specific service discipline is used for the transfer, in w_niso_d channel, through intermediate nodes, which is, somehow, similar to the stop-and-go mechanism proposed in <ref> [Gol91a] </ref>, [Gol91b]. We use a contention resolution mechanism based on the increase in bandwidth resource for lower priority traffic when different packets, of different priorities, are present at an intermediate station and the bandwidth resource available (in one frame) is less than the total requested bandwidth. <p> We believe, in contrast, that solutions where the service controller is based solely on the aggregate traffic of each class (so-called rate-based servers) are more advantageous, due to their simplicity and the choice to open up the processing bottleneck. Examples of such mechanisms are Stop-and-Go <ref> [Gol91a] </ref>, [Gol91b], [TG92] and Hierarchical Round Robin (HRR) [KKK90]. These mechanisms, which are based on using diverse time-framing strategies, do not need to monitor the 195 individual packets at every switching node. <p> It is not the case at Stop-and-Go, where the smoothness properties follow the common frames used both for admission and service. They get also related, in this case, to the number of intermediate stations between source and destination <ref> [Gol91a] </ref>. Moreover, the differentiation of w_niso_c control channel from w_niso_d data channel, together with the preemptive policy used in servicing diverse messages in w_niso_d, as well as the buffer insertion ring configuration used, reduces the clustering process (i.e., increased variability) in the interarrival times of packets/messages [BS83], [PY91]. <p> This is to compare with the Stop-and-Go solution, where the end-toend delay (deterministic component) has values between once and two times the product between frame (size) and the number of intermediate stations between source and destination <ref> [Gol91a] </ref>, [Gol91b]. The propagation delay on optical fiber between source and destination is ignored, since this is the same in both cases. There are therefore two domains of resource that require resource partitioning (at the level of a frame F k serv ) for nonisochronous traffic, i.e., w_niso_d and w_niso_c. <p> This means that it might happen that the network/node server is idle, though there are packets waiting for service (at the network edges or inside the nodes), but that are not yet admitted for service. The Stop-and-Go mechanism is typical for such kind of problems <ref> [Gol91a] </ref>, [Gol91b]. It can be reduced/ eliminated through the provision of a (lowest priority) traffic class with no delay guarantees, with best-effort service. 205 Similarly to the nonwork conserving problem, the DTS mechanism could also have problems that take the form of non-fairness. <p> the problem of lower efficiencies in resource utilization that may happen, in both data and control channels, because of the peak rate transport servicing, can be alleviated by combining the above-described framing strategy with other traffic management policies used for some classes of delay-insensitive traffic (best-effort services, as shown in <ref> [Gol91a] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The most obvious performance limitations are due to transmission loss and pulse spreading (because of chromatic dispersion). Other (secondary) limitations are due to mode partition noise (when using multi-longitudinal-mode MLM lasers) and chirping [Lin89]. There are two wavelength windows usable for transmission on typical (single-mode) optical fiber <ref> [Gow84] </ref>, [Hil90]. The shorter one is placed around 1300 nm, has a width of about 100 nm, and yields a fiber loss of about 0.4 dB/km together with a zero (material) dispersion at 1315 nm. An average value of 4 psec/km nm is considered for this window. <p> i f rs x ( a k R 1 + 1 ) erfc V i x+- dx 4.16 ( )= = = erfc a ( ) 2 e a db 4.17 ( )= 108 The shot noise generated in an APD can be considered as a filtered doubly stochastic process <ref> [Gow84] </ref>, [Tos90]. The amplitude distribution of the multiplied shot noise depends on the statistics of the avalanche carrier generation process, a (theoretical) model that is not yet known explicitly [Gow84], [Nak90]. <p> db 4.17 ( )= 108 The shot noise generated in an APD can be considered as a filtered doubly stochastic process <ref> [Gow84] </ref>, [Tos90]. The amplitude distribution of the multiplied shot noise depends on the statistics of the avalanche carrier generation process, a (theoretical) model that is not yet known explicitly [Gow84], [Nak90]. Because of that, (additional) power penalties must be considered when estimating the SNR a required to meet a specified error rate performance for an APD receiver. When a PIN photodetector is used, the shot noise can be considered to be negligible. <p> At any wavelength w, a light pulse travels a distance L through an optical medium in a time t given by <ref> [Gow84] </ref> where n is the refractive index, and c is the speed of light. Accordingly, if the pulse contains a range Dw of freespace wavelengths around w, the impulse spreads out as it propagates, and arrives at destination over a range of times Dt given by [Gow84] The different Fourier components <p> time t given by <ref> [Gow84] </ref> where n is the refractive index, and c is the speed of light. Accordingly, if the pulse contains a range Dw of freespace wavelengths around w, the impulse spreads out as it propagates, and arrives at destination over a range of times Dt given by [Gow84] The different Fourier components of an optical pulse therefore propagate at different speeds through an optical SM fiber, and a relative delay t = Dt is incurred by the two extreme lines/wavelengths when the center of lights is displaced from the wavelength of zero dispersion (i.e., about 1315 nm). <p> Degradation caused by dispersion takes the form of intersymbol interference (ISI) in the received data stream and a degradation a of the SNR given by (4.19). Subsequent system penalty of the error performance, given by (4.20), must therefore be considered to compensate for this <ref> [Gow84] </ref>, [Aca90]. Significant ISI happens when the pulse broadening t is larger than half the bit period (according to Figures 3-4 and 4-8), that is, t &gt; T. <p> The receiver sensitivity degrades rapidly in this case and, because of that, t = T is considered as a practical limit (so-called dispersion limit) in dimensioning the length of transmission <ref> [Gow84] </ref>, [Lin89], [Aca90]. <p> t DLW 4.27 ( ) T + t DLWR 1 4.28 ( ) 112 With the pulse shapes encountered in practical systems (Gaussian, Lorentzian, etc.), the condition of dispersion limit corresponds also to an additional power penalty of 3 dB added to the (theoretical) margin given by (4.23) or (4.24) <ref> [Gow84] </ref>, [Aca90]. Furthermore, in an WDM multichannel system, the dispersion on fiber limits not only the (maximum) product RL (or R 2 L) between the rate per channel and the distance between stations, but also the maximum number of WDM channels. <p> The first alternative is based on using optical fibers with more complex refractive index profiles, where the dispersion characteristics can be flattened to small values over the whole bandwidth of interest (so-called dispersion-flattened fibers) <ref> [Gow84] </ref>, [Tos90]. Dispersion values up to - 5 psec/kmnm or less can be provided in this case for both the wavelength windows [Tos90]. On the other hand, the second solution involves the use of recently developed monochromatic laser sources with narrow linewidth (so-called single-frequency lasers) [Lin89], [Tos90]. <p> Large signal-to-noise ratios b tr (of 55 to 65 dB), are easily obtainable for the clock cl_tr [Per81], <ref> [Gow84] </ref>. It is known, from the theory of (PLL or BPF) tracking of sinusoidal signals that, when a stationary noise is present in additive form at the input of a clock extraction device, an approximate linear analysis is still possible when the signal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently large [Vit66], [Lin73]. <p> The delay (of the buffer) in master station is not included in dt c . The propagation delay on optical fiber is approximated by <ref> [Gow84] </ref> where L represents the regeneration section; n c is the fiber core refractive index for the control channel/wavelength; and c is the speed of light. A value of 5 msec/km will be considered for the propagation delay in single-mode fibers.

Reference-contexts: The performance bottleneck has therefore shifted from the transmission channel to network nodes [DFM+91], <ref> [Gre91] </ref>, [Kle92]. Moreover, this picture is further complicated by the presence of diverse traffic classes with conflicting service requirements that must be supported by an integrated network. <p> (such as guided-wave and free-space optics) are still in the laboratory phase, and they still need to have their performance improved [Hin92]. 6 1.2.1.2 Multiwavelength Optical Networks The best architectural models for utilizing the large bandwidth resource available on optical fiber are those based on Wavelength Division Multi-Access (WDMA) [Bra90], <ref> [Gre91] </ref>. In such architectures (Fig. 1-3), multiple optical channels spaced apart in the spectral domain are used to provide switchable interconnections between any two users. Generally, the stations have one or more electro-optical interface (s), and these networks can be broadly classified as using wavelength agility or not. <p> For instance, it is possible to think of relegating the error recovery to the application layer (fault-tolerant end systems), since the very low error rates do not motivate the traditional retransmission-based schemes for time-critical, high-throughput (video) applications <ref> [Gre91] </ref>. Another solution of interest in multigigabit environments is to tradeoff processing and/or bandwidth to recover from errors without retransmissions. This is because network resources (bandwidth and/or hardware), latency and reliability (in communication) are generally interrelated and an improvement in one parameter comes at the expense of the others.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, additional requirements such as increased flexibility, security, affordability and optimum use of network resources must be fulfilled as well. Today, new multi-Gbit/s optical integrated networks, which carry simultaneously diverse real-time synchronous traffic, intra-system traffic with stringent latency requirements, and inter-system traffic, are under development [BCF+92], [Che92], <ref> [Gre92] </ref>, [KBH+92], [Kun92], [Tol92]. However, while the Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technique has further manifoldly increased the transmission capacity on optical fiber [Bra90], the performance increase of supporting nodal electronics and (software) processing needed for switching, buffering and control purposes has not matched this trend. <p> These technological limitations greatly deteriorate the performance for WDU architectures (service bottleneck) and therefore restricts the area of applicability for (fast) packet switching services [AK89], <ref> [Gre92] </ref>. Also, another bottleneck in WDU networks is because of congestion in the optical power domain given by the optical splitting in the case of passive central node. <p> However, wavelength-agile components are still used. Also, the solution advanced for the packetswitching services (ATM transport form in combination with multihop architecture) is not advantageous for delay- and jitter-critical (computer) communications. The RAINBOW network [DGL+90], <ref> [Gre92] </ref> provides, perhaps, the best example of service bottleneck in multigigabit environments. An WDMA architecture of type WDU is used with fixed frequency optical transmitters and tunable optical receivers. A passive star topology is used. <p> These advantages (expressed in terms of service flexibility and network efficiency) do not justify the increased complexity of the (distributed) protocol processing, congestion control and switching. The service bottleneck is consequently exacerbated, as it is very difficult to guarantee requested QoS for all traffic classes [CP90], [BS91], <ref> [Gre92] </ref>. We ignore other alternatives, like common resources in code domain, because of their poor 36 ness in terms of spectral efficiency, which results in low throughput performance [Sal89].

Reference-contexts: So the understanding of application requirements is a prerequisite for the proper design of future high-performance networks. Generally, the incoming traffic can be divided into two main classes, isochronous (real-time) and nonisochronous (non real-time) , each with distinct performance requirements <ref> [GRV90] </ref>, [RB90], [BS91], [RD91b]. Isochronous traffic generally includes Continuous Bit Rate (CBR) traffic and Variable Bit Rate (VBR) of continuous type, e.g., VBR video traffic. In contrast, nonisochro-nous traffic sources generate intermittent traffic and usually alternate between active and inactive periods.

Reference-contexts: Three levels of parallelism are generally identified for a communication process, which are given by the degree of granularity (i.e., coarse grain, medium grain and fine grain) used when introducing parallelism into protocol processing [JSB90], <ref> [Haa91] </ref>, [Zit91], [GNI92]. 26 Typically, coarse grain processing involves high-level functions or tasks assigned to individual processors such as, for instance, in the case of connection-dedicated-to-processor approach. <p> MAC layer, the information data stream is still handled according to a vertically-oriented model at other layers (e.g., MAC layer and below), resulting in the performance bottlenecks discussed earlier. 28 The third alternative structure for parallel communication architecture is provided in the case of fine grain processing, as proposed in <ref> [Haa91] </ref>. The main idea is that the diverse protocol layers between the MAC and application layer are all combined into a single layer that is horizon tally structured (Fig. 2-4). This is an architecture with a functional parallelism that is done within the (communication) Protocol Layer.

Reference-contexts: We have moved now into a new domain where the design considerations are completely reversed. Specifically, we have passed from a capacity-limited design (non-gigabit networking) to a latency-limited design (gigabit networking), as shown in Fig. 2-1 <ref> [Haa92] </ref>, [Kle92]. 24 Narrowband Environment Broadband Environment Throughput limited by network Throughput limited by application/host Queueing delay dominant Propagation delay limitation Protocols designed for lossy and slow Success-oriented design networks Lightwave protocols Capacity-limited design Latency-limited design Fig. 2-1. <p> In an optical LAN, efficiency in utilization of optical energy is usually a dominant consideration. Because of the power limitation in optical domain (and, consequently, reduced network bandwidth), physical topologies using passive couplers/taps such as bus, tree or star are generally not good candidates [Hen89], <ref> [Haa92] </ref>. Increasing the network bandwidth B w for such networks would require fundamental technological improvements, such as increasing the optical transmitted power and/or the receiver sensitivities at high bit rates [BB85], [Bra90]. The focus, therefore, will be on physical topologies based on point-to-point interconnections.

Reference-contexts: Because of their deterministic nature, the different systematic jitter components from tandem stations add on a linear basis and cannot be reduced by filtering [SE77], [TSC88]. Systematic jitter includes two components, namely, the Duty Cycle Distortion Jitter (DCDJ) and the Data Dependent Jitter (DDJ) <ref> [Han90] </ref>. The first component is mainly caused by asymmetries of rise/fall times in the received pulses.

Generally, the problem of determining the optimal physical topology should be differentiated from the problem of determining the optimal virtual topology [Ban90].

Reference-contexts: Additionally, the switch throughput is fundamentally limited in the ATM case by the limited capacity available in the control channel (within the switch) and not by technological limitations on optical networks such as power-budget or dispersion <ref> [Hen89] </ref>, [Bra91]. Technological breakthroughs are needed in switch implementation to alleviate this bottleneck. Thus, there is a definite need for novel ways of dealing with the conflict between the heterogeneity and the performance (needs) of application traffic. <p> In an optical LAN, efficiency in utilization of optical energy is usually a dominant consideration.

Reference-contexts: The most obvious performance limitations are due to transmission loss and pulse spreading (because of chromatic dispersion). Other (secondary) limitations are due to mode partition noise (when using multi-longitudinal-mode MLM lasers) and chirping [Lin89]. There are two wavelength windows usable for transmission on typical (single-mode) optical fiber [Gow84], <ref> [Hil90] </ref>. The shorter one is placed around 1300 nm, has a width of about 100 nm, and yields a fiber loss of about 0.4 dB/km together with a zero (material) dispersion at 1315 nm. An average value of 4 psec/km nm is considered for this window. <p> There are two possible solutions to overcome the fiber dispersion and to expand in this way the dispersion limit. These are to modify the fiber characteristics and/or to modify the (laser) source linewidth characteristics <ref> [Hil90] </ref>. The first alternative is based on using optical fibers with more complex refractive index profiles, where the dispersion characteristics can be flattened to small values over the whole bandwidth of interest (so-called dispersion-flattened fibers) [Gow84], [Tos90]. <p> This means that a number of maximum of (3 + 5) wavelength channels would be possible in each of the two wavelength windows (W 1 + W 2 ), in the case of MM Fabry-Perot lasers <ref> [Hil90] </ref>. On the other hand, a more efficient use of fiber bandwidth, i.e., a number of (14 + 21) channels, would be possible when using the more expensive SM lasers [Hil90]. <p> in each of the two wavelength windows (W 1 + W 2 ), in the case of MM Fabry-Perot lasers <ref> [Hil90] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Technological breakthroughs are still needed in the electrical domain to open up the service and processing bottlenecks, for the case of single electro-optic interface operating at multi-Gbit/s rates. 1.2.1.1.2 TDM in Optical Domain Another concurrent technique is that of the TDM in optical domain [PSS86], [PBS87], <ref> [Hin92] </ref>. This is an approach wherein each bit belonging to different packets (generated by different stations/users) is optically compressed in time, and the bits corresponding to concurrently generated packets are time-multiplexed in the optical domain. <p> Furthermore, technologies for multiplexing and switching in the optical path (such as guided-wave and free-space optics) are still in the laboratory phase, and they still need to have their performance improved <ref> [Hin92] </ref>. 6 1.2.1.2 Multiwavelength Optical Networks The best architectural models for utilizing the large bandwidth resource available on optical fiber are those based on Wavelength Division Multi-Access (WDMA) [Bra90], [Gre91]. <p> To manipulate large amounts of multimedia data in a multi-Gbit/s ATM environment (i.e., beyond the actual standard data rates of 155 and 622 Mbit/s), new and sophisticated switching fabrics embedding advanced technologies within them (such as photonics, BiCMOS and GaAs MESFET) are required [Cha91], [JC91], [RW91], <ref> [Hin92] </ref>. Gidron and his colleagues have recently proposed and studied the TERANET architecture [Gid91]. This is a multichannel optical network where all seven layers of the OSI standard are studied in a multigigabit environment. <p> These are implicitly contained in the slot position in each frame, which are decided according to specific multiaccess procedures in the multiaccess control channels/wavelengths. A slotted format is used for the isochronous data channel, with variable-capacity, fixed-time slots (so-called universal time slots <ref> [Hin92] </ref>). An universal time slot is a partitioned section of time that can contain information transmitted at diverse bit rates. This is illustrated in Fig. 2-15, where a TDM frame is decomposed into a number of time slots, each of which containing information of different bandwidths.

Reference-contexts: of stations allowed in network, and lasers with high peak optical power are required to increase the number of stations [Bra90], [Bra91]. 1.2.1.2.2 Multihop Architecture The second WDMA model, the so-called multihop architecture, is used by several proposed networks such as the Manhattan Street Network (MSN) [Max85], the ShuffleNet [Aca87], <ref> [HK91] </ref>, Store-and-Forward With Integrated Frequency-Time (SWIFT) [CG87], the Lightnet [CGK88], and the Wavelength-Division Optical Network (WON) [Ban90]. A distributed topology is used, with a distributed temporal switching function, in which each station has access to a small number of fixed-wavelength transmitters and receivers (coarse WDM). <p> Additionally, there is no need for adaptive routing to compensate for variable traffic intensities and/or patterns as in networks based on the multihop concept [Aca87], [CG87], [CGK88], [Ban90], <ref> [HK91] </ref>. Low latency and jitter can be provided in the transport of data, which is advantageous for services with strict time constraints, i.e., real-time traffic. <p> This is a combinatorial optimization problem that has been intensively investigated by the authors of WDMA networks based on the multihop concept [Aca87], [CG87], [CGK88], [AK89], [Ban90], <ref> [HK91] </ref>. The proposed separation concept simplifies the solution for this problem.

Reference-contexts: Wavelength-agile components are used for switching. Examples of such architectures are the Fast Optical Cross-connect (FOX), the Hypass and Bhypass Switches, the Photonic Knockout Switch [Goo89], the StarTrack Switch [LGA90], Rainbow [DGL+90], and others <ref> [HKS87] </ref>, [Meh90], [SGK91], [SBD92]. This architecture presents, however, fundamental difficulties when using distributed control [Ram93]. Typically, a star topology is used, with a central passive node to and from which all communication take place. <p> Each user transmits its information on an unique wavelength, and a pretransmission procedure is needed for the tuning of two end users to the same wavelength. Different alternative procedures are possible (reservation and pre-allocation strategies) [Muk92a], [Ram93], but they all are time-consuming and cause high access delays <ref> [HKS87] </ref>, [LGA90], [SGK91], [SBD92]. This means that this network model is not consistent with bursty traffic needs in terms of low access delay requirements. The wavelength switching is a time-consuming process as well.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, there are a few new WDMA architectures that have been proposed with similar concepts of partitioning (in wavelength domain) the information traffic from the control traffic <ref> [HRS92] </ref>, [Muk92a], [Ram93]. Compared to these architectures, our architecture has two advantages. There is no need for fast-tunable transmitters and/or receivers (for information channels) where the tuning times are considerable shorter than the packet lengths. <p> A Connectionless (CL) procedure is proposed for nonisochronous traffic, with a distributed MAC protocol working at a packet level, and with a congestion-tolerant control mechanism based on dynamic resource adjustment (implemented with multiple registers inserted in the data channel). Furthermore, a fast reservation scheme (so-called "tell and go" <ref> [HRS92] </ref>, [Ram93]) is used for resource allocation to provide low access delays. Under such a scheme, a station simply informs the destination station (on the control channel) that it is transmitting a packet and goes ahead and does this in the next frame (in data channel).

Reference-contexts: such as flow control and error recovery, to the edge of the network (with the result of conflicting the fundamental principle for supporting statistical multiplexing and CBR, which requires that elaborate congestion and rate-control schemes be executed on a real-time basis inside the network, and not at the edge) [BS91], <ref> [HS91] </ref>, [VS91], [DJ92], [Lea92]. One of the most important research issues in ATM is related to the characterization of the arrival process for bursty traffic, which is still an open issue. <p> The algorithms require to measure the specific load in network/node and to take then remedial (preventive or reactive) actions under different constraints, such as fairness, low processing overhead, low responsiveness and limited amount of buffer space available in network nodes <ref> [HS91] </ref>, [VS91], [DJ92]. The fundamental issue of the dominance of propagation delay in the face of very high transport speeds and highly bursty traffic, with diverse characteristics, means that reactive (adaptive feedback) control algorithms are not suitable for broadband networks [HS91], [Kle92], [YM92]. <p> and limited amount of buffer space available in network nodes <ref> [HS91] </ref>, [VS91], [DJ92]. The fundamental issue of the dominance of propagation delay in the face of very high transport speeds and highly bursty traffic, with diverse characteristics, means that reactive (adaptive feedback) control algorithms are not suitable for broadband networks [HS91], [Kle92], [YM92]. Such mechanisms are performance limited by the round trip delay of the feedback information, which does not match the temporal constraints of broadband services. Moreover, large amounts of buffer space are required in nodes to minimize the risk of buffer overflow. <p> This is because here the required performance can only be statistically guaranteed, and because of fairness problems in the case of congestion <ref> [HS91] </ref>. On the other hand, policing/shaping procedures (such as Leaky Bucket [BLM87], [Tur87]), used to assure that any change in the behavior of traffic source does not affect the other users (fairness criteria), are advantageous, since they guarantee traffic parameters on which statistical multiplexing can be done.

Reference-contexts: Some of these requirements are presented in Table 2 [Spe87], <ref> [HSS90] </ref>, [DN91]. The main observation that can be done is therefore related to the wide variety of both traffic characteristics and performance requirements needed to be provided by the transport system.

Reference-contexts: Large bursts of delay-insensitive traffic may worsen the delay performance for time-critical traffic. Further research is needed in characterizing the superposition process (single queue with multiple arrivals) in ATM networks <ref> [Hui90] </ref>. One can, for example, model each bursty source separately, but this may lead to an intractable model for an increased number of connec 12 tions multiplexed on the same link. <p> This means that the switching architecture must provide appropriate transfer of data from one user to another user in such a way to flexibly meet the desired grade of service (such as throughput, delay or blocking performance) for all traffic classes. There are two main switching techniques <ref> [Hui90] </ref>, [Tob90]: circuit-switching, with poor bandwidth utilization, but with relative simplicity of the access mechanism; and packet-switching, with high service flexibility and network efficiency, but with sophisti cated control algorithms. <p> Modeling the entering traffic as a stochastic process is often intractable for realistic models [BG87]. Moreover, the complicated way in which different traffic streams "interact" with each other, with correlated (packet) arrival processes at different nodes <ref> [Hui90] </ref>, heavily complicates the issue of guaranteeing the requested QoS for all subclasses of traffic. Instead of using a stochastic model for the entering nonisochronous traffic, we will consider this traffic as being "unknown", but satisfies certain burstiness constraints (i.e., regularity constraints). <p> This is a sophisticated problem that has been intensively studied [Kau81], [FG83], [KS84], [KS85], <ref> [Hui90] </ref>, [Ka91], [YH91], [Kau92], [LH92].

Reference-contexts: Three levels of parallelism are generally identified for a communication process, which are given by the degree of granularity (i.e., coarse grain, medium grain and fine grain) used when introducing parallelism into protocol processing <ref> [JSB90] </ref>, [Haa91], [Zit91], [GNI92]. 26 Typically, coarse grain processing involves high-level functions or tasks assigned to individual processors such as, for instance, in the case of connection-dedicated-to-processor approach. <p> This is similar in fact to increasing the processing power (for transport protocol) in the abovementioned layer-pipeline model. Performance improvements are obtained, regardless of traffic intensity, pattern or distribution over connections <ref> [JSB90] </ref>, [GNI92], [TW92]. However, careful implementation of the protocol is required because of the inherent sequentiality of packets in the data stream. Sophisticated solutions are required to cope with diverse error and fault conditions [JSB90]. <p> Performance improvements are obtained, regardless of traffic intensity, pattern or distribution over connections <ref> [JSB90] </ref>, [GNI92], [TW92]. However, careful implementation of the protocol is required because of the inherent sequentiality of packets in the data stream.

Also, a serious drawback of this method is given by the difficulty with which the control information is processed at a packet level. <p> In the case of packetswitching, the main problems are related to the sophisticated processing required to interpret the packet header, which becomes the bottleneck at hundreds of Mbit/s and over <ref> [JSB90] </ref>, [NRS90], [LaPS91]. For packet-switching to remain attractive at high speeds in an integrated network environment, either the speed of the processing elements must be faster (technological limitations) or the size of packets must increase (problems with the service bottleneck).

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, suitable algorithms to support real-time presentation of concurrent media to the application (continuous synchronization) are required as well. On a low level, the transport layer must provide Stream Synchronization. This has two components, namely a local synchronization (node-to-node) and a global synchronization (network synchronization) [LGH+85], <ref> [Kar91] </ref>, [SL91]. The synchronization system must account for different and variable latencies of the component elements from source to destination (i.e., links and intermediate nodes), to support the transmission of multiple data streams. Synchronization capabilities across these data streams must be provided at a low level (local synchronization).

However, while the Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technique has further manifoldly increased the transmission capacity on optical fiber [Bra90], the performance increase of supporting nodal electronics and (software) processing needed for switching, buffering and control purposes has not matched this trend.

Reference-contexts: Because of that, the fundamental assumption that the main network resources (i.e., communication and switching resources/bandwidth, buffer space and processing capabilities) are both observable and controllable, no longer suffices <ref> [Kle90] </ref>, [Kle92]. The major problem faced in an integrated multi-gigabit network environment is connected with the lack of "actual" global knowledge regarding the system state. The distance between interacting users may become a very major problem with regard to the interaction speed and the bandwidth of the communication link. <p> a multigigabit optical network (effect of the finite speed-of-light latency), some forms of managing the indeterminism of state in stations must be also envisaged [TF93]. 2.1.2 Pipelining the Communication Process There are four general methods of resolving conflicts in a (centralized or distributed) system, i.e., queueing, splitting, blocking and smashing <ref> [Kle90] </ref>. They have different consequences and are applicable to communication services as well. One of the most common method for conflict resolution, queueing, resolves the conflict by allowing only one user at a time to access the resource while the other users wait for their turn. <p> Unique sets of requirements are imposed on the communication component of a multimedia system, due to the size and characteristics of different multimedia objects. Also, extra requirements in terms of coexistence, integration and interaction of different media (traffic) by mutual synchronization heavily complicate the issue of multimedia traffic integration <ref> [Kle90] </ref>, [LG90b]. Generally, there are three levels of integration possible for the provision of multimedia services in an integrated environment, i.e., the human interface, the service interface and the media interface [Sve87].

Reference-contexts: The performance bottleneck has therefore shifted from the transmission channel to network nodes [DFM+91], [Gre91], <ref> [Kle92] </ref>. Moreover, this picture is further complicated by the presence of diverse traffic classes with conflicting service requirements that must be supported by an integrated network. <p> Large packet/cell sizes are not advantageous for carrying mixed broadband traffic with different characteristics [BS91], [DJ92]. The question of the precise practical limit of such electro-optic interfaces is therefore still open, but it currently appears very difficult to extend the bit rate beyond 2.4 Gbit/s <ref> [Kle92] </ref>, [Kun92], [McE92], [MC93], [TS93]. <p> Furthermore, to compensate for the increased ratio of propagation delay to cell/packet transmission time, some form of structural and/or functional parallelism (or pipelining) must be used in processing the different protocols and/or data structures involved in a communication process [Zit91], [GNI92], <ref> [Kle92] </ref>, [ITN93]. 1.3 Solution Approach The fundamental shift in technologies and their tradeoff forces us to consider new alternative approaches to the integrated multi-Gbit/s communication over multiwavelength optical networks. <p> Because of that, the fundamental assumption that the main network resources (i.e., communication and switching resources/bandwidth, buffer space and processing capabilities) are both observable and controllable, no longer suffices [Kle90], <ref> [Kle92] </ref>. The major problem faced in an integrated multi-gigabit network environment is connected with the lack of "actual" global knowledge regarding the system state. The distance between interacting users may become a very major problem with regard to the interaction speed and the bandwidth of the communication link. <p> We have moved now into a new domain where the design considerations are completely reversed. Specifically, we have passed from a capacity-limited design (non-gigabit networking) to a latency-limited design (gigabit networking), as shown in Fig. 2-1 [Haa92], <ref> [Kle92] </ref>. 24 Narrowband Environment Broadband Environment Throughput limited by network Throughput limited by application/host Queueing delay dominant Propagation delay limitation Protocols designed for lossy and slow Success-oriented design networks Lightwave protocols Capacity-limited design Latency-limited design Fig. 2-1. <p> S i : station i ss ik : substation k connected to station i 25 But because only making use of gigabit transport channels and faster processors does not actually help too much in reducing the mean and/or maximum response time of a gigabit network (with respect to multi-megabit networks) <ref> [Kle92] </ref>, new and better communication models need to be conceived. The latency in data transport and processing should be hidden, as much as possible, by using maximum possible pipelining and parallelism in the communication process. Some forms of parallel processing and parallel transmission must be used. <p> Given the large bandwidth-delay products available in a multigigabit optical network, such a pipeline model is effective only when the application layer generates large messages (or files) that are larger than the bandwidth-delay product of Layer 0, to prevent latency-bounded communication <ref> [Kle92] </ref>, [TF93]. For instance, in [Kle92] it is shown that, to accommodate propagation delays (T Stage0 ) of 15 milliseconds, gigabit channels begin to pay off only for large message sizes of 10 Megabits or more. This communication model may, therefore, become performance-limited. <p> Given the large bandwidth-delay products available in a multigigabit optical network, such a pipeline model is effective only when the application layer generates large messages (or files) that are larger than the bandwidth-delay product of Layer 0, to prevent latency-bounded communication <ref> [Kle92] </ref>, [TF93].

This communication model may, therefore, become performance-limited. It is restrictive for applications in which the focus is on latency. <p> The fundamental issue of the dominance of propagation delay in the face of very high transport speeds and highly bursty traffic, with diverse characteristics, means that reactive (adaptive feedback) control algorithms are not suitable for broadband networks [HS91], <ref> [Kle92] </ref>, [YM92]. Such mechanisms are performance limited by the round trip delay of the feedback information, which does not match the temporal constraints of broadband services. Moreover, large amounts of buffer space are required in nodes to minimize the risk of buffer overflow.

Reference-contexts: Also, there is a supplementary requirement for ring topologies that an integral number of fixed-length data frames/slots be in transit around the circumference of the ring <ref> [KMM83] </ref>. Detection and synchronization capabilities must therefore be provided for error-free transmission inside each subnetwork as well as synchronization facilities at the network level, i.e., among data streams belonging to the same application. <p> This jitter component dominates at low input signal levels and it adds on a power basis (i.e., r.m.s.). It can, therefore, be reduced by a proper filtering in the PLL device <ref> [KMM83] </ref>, [TSC88]. The major contribution to the timing jitter is, however, caused by data randomness, ISI distortion and PLL hardware imperfections (in terms of static phase offset/deviations). <p> Because of its characteristics, systematic jitter builds up much faster than random jitter in a chain of self-timed regenerators [SE77], <ref> [KMM83] </ref>, [TS88]. This decisively impacts on link and network performances, such as bit error rate P e , maximum allowable distance between regenerators and maximum number of stations in cascade around the ring. <p> Furthermore, different methods may be used to extract the clock signal from the received data signal, which are based either on asynchronous or synchronous techniques or on plesiochronous methods <ref> [KMM83] </ref>, [LGH+85]. The asynchronous approach, by which the sender transmits only when there is data to transmit, resulting in an intermittent presence of data signal in the transmission channel, is not suitable for active-tapping ring configurations as in our case. <p> However, the static phase offset is difficult to set and may be temperature dependent. With tolerances for temperature, voltage and diverse components, the frequency of Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO) in PLL can deviate up to - 10% from the reference clock frequency [BCK+83], <ref> [KMM83] </ref>. To assure that the sampling of the received data bits occurs at the most optimum time instant in the slot period, a variable delay line or some electronic phase shifting circuit may be used for an optimum phase deviation of the clock cl_rc_x. <p> Because of the elimination of accumulated systematic jitter, as well as the Gaussian nature of jitter J a x (t), low power penalties (less than 0.5 dB) can be easily provided for J a x (t) with optimum values for w PLL and x [SE77], <ref> [KMM83] </ref>, [TSC88]. Furthermore, it is noted, from subsection 4.5.7, that the penalty due to jitter and static phase offset does still not affect network performances, e.g., maximum distance between stations and speed in data channels, which are limited by dispersion in optical fiber only.

Reference-contexts: issues related to the efficient implementation of protocols, such as shortening the length of the instruction path, minimum possible memory moves (so-called single-copy architectures), low-over 14 head process structures (i.e., modification of the protocol syntax), minimum number of calls to the operating system, etc., must be addressed as well [DDK+90], <ref> [LaPS91] </ref>, [MS92], [BP93], [DAP+93], [DWB+93]. <p> Though the control functions usually react on time scales larger than those given by packet (or cell) sizes. This feature is not desirable in a multigigabit environment (processing bottleneck problems) [DDK+90], <ref> [LaPS91] </ref>, [DJ92]. 38 We consider, therefore, that an appropriate solution for very high speed networks is given by decoupling the transport of data traffic from the transport of control traffic, together with provision of requested synchronization facilities. <p> In the case of packetswitching, the main problems are related to the sophisticated processing required to interpret the packet header, which becomes the bottleneck at hundreds of Mbit/s and over [JSB90], [NRS90], <ref> [LaPS91] </ref>. For packet-switching to remain attractive at high speeds in an integrated network environment, either the speed of the processing elements must be faster (technological limitations) or the size of packets must increase (problems with the service bottleneck). <p> Usually implemented in software, the transport protocol may require a large amount of processing and easily become the performance bottleneck at gigabit communications. The advent of photonic technology offering increasing transmission capacity at decreasing error rates have had a profound impact on the design of transport protocols [DDK+90], <ref> [LaPS91] </ref>, [DJ92]. Large bandwidth-delay products and very low error rates (10 -9 and less) mean that streamlined mechanisms operating on an end-user basis are needed to avoid the processing bottleneck and to allow high rate (best-effort) services. <p> Lightwave protocols, with minimum overhead to minimize the processing for steady-state situation, are desirable in high speed environments [DDK+90], <ref> [LaPS91] </ref>. On the other hand, there is a fundamental conflict between this and the need for additional functionality that must be provided for efficient recovery from errors and failures [FB90], [DJ92]. <p> Large windows are needed to keep the pipeline full and maximize throughput, but this means that effective control mechanisms (for error handling) cannot be achieved. The flow control function must, therefore, be independent of error handling [CLZ87], <ref> [LaPS91] </ref>, and they are supported in our case by distinct channels in different wavelengths. 2.2.4.5.1 Flow Control The key problem to be resolved in the design of flow control mechanisms for multigigabit environments is how to control the user data flow in the presence of large bandwidth-delay products, i.e., large amounts <p> The window must be opened in this case to such an extend, that most (computer) messages can fit into one window. Effective flow control cannot, therefore, be achieved in this case [DDK+90], <ref> [LaPS91] </ref>. 53 Rate-based flow control mechanisms are proposed in the literature as an alternative solution to generate a smoother transmission pattern, to the benefit of transport network and users [DDK+90], [LaPS91], [TF93]. <p> Effective flow control cannot, therefore, be achieved in this case [DDK+90], <ref> [LaPS91] </ref>. 53 Rate-based flow control mechanisms are proposed in the literature as an alternative solution to generate a smoother transmission pattern, to the benefit of transport network and users [DDK+90], [LaPS91], [TF93]. Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that such a control mechanism is not faster than the window-based mechanism (because of its reactive nature). We consider that an appropriate solution for end-to-end flow control in a multigigabit environment (with focus on latency) is a preventive one.

Exact expressions for the moment generating functions of the queue size and, accordingly, for the delays W DAOS niso,k and W ID niso,k , can be derived in this case.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, each type of traffic differs in its admissible access and transit latencies, jitter (delay dispersion), end-to-end loss sensitivities, reliability, need for sequenced delivery, etc. Additional synchronization requirements, such as inter-media synchronization facilities across two or more real-time channels in a multimedia communication/retrieval <ref> [LG90a] </ref>, [RVR92], further complicate this picture. So the understanding of application requirements is a prerequisite for the proper design of future high-performance networks. Generally, the incoming traffic can be divided into two main classes, isochronous (real-time) and nonisochronous (non real-time) , each with distinct performance requirements [GRV90], [RB90], [BS91], [RD91b]. <p> It is also a significant requirement of future multimedia applications, where the need of synchronization provisions for real-time stream traffic, as well as preorchestrated stored data, has been identified <ref> [LG90a] </ref>, [LG90b], [Nic90], [Ste90]. As mentioned above, the future multimedia (computer) systems must be able to generate, process, store, retrieve, communicate and present complex data objects (including mixed data types) under conditions of extreme heterogeneity. <p> The spatial composition refers to the combination of data objects in space (e.g., image with text), whereas the temporal composition concerns with synchronization of multiple data streams consisting of data objects with diverse granularities/periodicities <ref> [LG90a] </ref>. Synchronization in the context of multimedia therefore refers to the specific mechanisms used to coordinate the ordering of different processes in time domain. The same definition is true for the parallel communication model proposed in Fig. 2-8. <p> It is implemented at the Communication Manager layer and handles data objects generated in the Communication Layer. Usually, object modeling is used to identify classes of related data sets and, based on the defined object classes, an object hierarchy is created to which object synchronization can be applied <ref> [LG90a] </ref>, [Ste90]. Appropriate temporal relationships must be guaranteed between/among different data objects according to diverse functions, such as object (s) generation, composition, transport, presentation, etc.

Reference-contexts: Also, extra requirements in terms of coexistence, integration and interaction of different media (traffic) by mutual synchronization heavily complicate the issue of multimedia traffic integration [Kle90], <ref> [LG90b] </ref>. Generally, there are three levels of integration possible for the provision of multimedia services in an integrated environment, i.e., the human interface, the service interface and the media interface [Sve87]. <p> The fundamental importance of using these data units/formats is that they can be processed out-of-order (with respect to other data units) at the application level. Moreover, the ATM transport mechanism is not the best solution for temporal integration, since various anomalies heavily deteriorates the (mutual) synchronization performance <ref> [LG90b] </ref>. Furthermore, reducing jitter is very much harder in the case of independent data streams multiplexed onto a single channel than if these streams were completely separate [Nic90]. <p> It is also a significant requirement of future multimedia applications, where the need of synchronization provisions for real-time stream traffic, as well as preorchestrated stored data, has been identified [LG90a], <ref> [LG90b] </ref>, [Nic90], [Ste90]. As mentioned above, the future multimedia (computer) systems must be able to generate, process, store, retrieve, communicate and present complex data objects (including mixed data types) under conditions of extreme heterogeneity. <p> Generally, there are three levels of synchronization identified for ultimate presentation of multimedia objects to the user <ref> [LG90b] </ref>. <p> These relationships can be of sequential or parallel nature, and it has been shown that a maximum of seven (basic) relationships can provide any temporal composition between pairs of objects <ref> [LG90b] </ref>. Furthermore, suitable algorithms to support real-time presentation of concurrent media to the application (continuous synchronization) are required as well. On a low level, the transport layer must provide Stream Synchronization. This has two components, namely a local synchronization (node-to-node) and a global synchronization (network synchronization) [LGH+85], [Kar91], [SL91].

Reference-contexts: Wavelength-agile components are used for switching. Examples of such architectures are the Fast Optical Cross-connect (FOX), the Hypass and Bhypass Switches, the Photonic Knockout Switch [Goo89], the StarTrack Switch <ref> [LGA90] </ref>, Rainbow [DGL+90], and others [HKS87], [Meh90], [SGK91], [SBD92]. This architecture presents, however, fundamental difficulties when using distributed control [Ram93]. Typically, a star topology is used, with a central passive node to and from which all communication take place. <p> Each user transmits its information on an unique wavelength, and a pretransmission procedure is needed for the tuning of two end users to the same wavelength. Different alternative procedures are possible (reservation and pre-allocation strategies) [Muk92a], [Ram93], but they all are time-consuming and cause high access delays [HKS87], <ref> [LGA90] </ref>, [SGK91], [SBD92]. This means that this network model is not consistent with bursty traffic needs in terms of low access delay requirements. The wavelength switching is a time-consuming process as well. <p> For instance, there is no need for wavelength agility as in other multiwavelength optical networks based on the wavelength-dedicated-to-user (WDU) concept [DGL+90], <ref> [LGA90] </ref>, [Meh90], [SGK91], [SBD92]. This greatly enlarges the area of applicability by opening up the service bottleneck. Fast packet switching services can be easily provided in this case without the need for technological breakthroughs, such as fast wavelength-agile components used at the electro-optic interface.

This has two components, namely a local synchronization (node-to-node) and a global synchronization (network synchronization) <ref> [LGH+85] </ref>, [Kar91], [SL91]. The synchronization system must account for different and variable latencies of the component elements from source to destination (i.e., links and intermediate nodes), to support the transmission of multiple data streams. Synchronization capabilities across these data streams must be provided at a low level (local synchronization). <p> Furthermore, different methods may be used to extract the clock signal from the received data signal, which are based either on asynchronous or synchronous techniques or on plesiochronous methods [KMM83], <ref> [LGH+85] </ref>.

There are two methods to compensate for these errors: by changing the density of bits within a frame or slot, i.e., buffering data at one or more nodes <ref> [LGH+85] </ref>; or by altering the slot/frame rate, i.e., socalled slot/frame stretching/shrinking technique [BE85].

Reference-contexts: In addition to existing communication services (like the ubiquitous voice, file transfer, etc.), future networks must also support broadband interactive services (of type conversational, messaging and retrieval) [CCI88]. The emerging services are of various types for multi-media (voice, video and/or data), multi-rate and multi-point communications <ref> [Lid90] </ref>, [WT90]. Accordingly, the incoming traffic is highly heterogeneous in its characteristics and performance requirements, with different and contradictory (bandwidth) resource demands, holding times and call/session arrival rates. <p> These sources are much more controllable than the isochronous sources, i.e., they can stop or slow down transmitting if requested from the network. Most of the computer data applications fall into this class. The variety of computer application models <ref> [Lid90] </ref> translates into a variety of performance needs expected from the underlying transport network. Furthermore, the MAC mechanisms for such traffic are based on different delay-throughput tradeoffs. Also, the transport mechanisms must provide delivering of data in recognizable form (without errors). <p> Here, remote software operations such as Remote Procedure Call (RPC), Inter-Object Communication (IOC) and Demand Paging (DP) invoke edge-to-edge network delays of tens and hundreds of microseconds, and data bursts with lengths in the range up to hundreds of kbits <ref> [Lid90] </ref>. Very stringent requirements! For instance, a data message of 100 kbits with a transmission speed of 10 Gbit/s corresponds to a data transmission time of 10 msec, i.e., 20 msec for both sides of a link (transmission and reception). <p> Here, remote software operations, such as Remote Procedure Call (RPC), Inter-Object Communication (IOC) and Demand Paging (DP), require both very low latencies (tens, or hundreds of microseconds) and very large throughputs (data bursts with lengths in the range up to hundreds of kbits) <ref> [Lid90] </ref>. Furthermore, isochronous traffic can not tolerate excessive delays, or large delay variances, in delivery (isochronicity requirements) [WT90]. This means that the underlying transport network must work in extreme conditions, such as the highest possible transmission speed and a minimum processing delay for multiaccess and transport protocols. <p> and high-performance supercomputers) will increase the network load fluctuations as well. 80 The distributed and client-server applications that are gaining favor today have also a wide variety of bandwidth requirements, from several kbit/s (for general-purpose office automation) up to hundreds of Mbit/s (for scientific applications), as shown in Table 1 <ref> [Lid90] </ref>, [SB92].

Reference-contexts: It is known, from the theory of (PLL or BPF) tracking of sinusoidal signals that, when a stationary noise is present in additive form at the input of a clock extraction device, an approximate linear analysis is still possible when the signal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently large [Vit66], <ref> [Lin73] </ref>. Making the linearity assumption, the phase jitter of the extracted clock signal is a Gaussian random process.

Reference-contexts: Such techniques are, however, not taken into consideration here due to such serious drawbacks as complexity and large costs [GR90]. Difficult technical problems connected with laser amplitude fluctuations, polarization control, laser linewidth, etc., heavily complicate the solution of choice for this approach <ref> [Lin89] </ref>. In any practical direct detection system, the receiver sensitivity is affected by noises of diverse nature, as shown in Fig. 4-2. An optical receiver, containing either a PIN diode or an Avalanche Photodiode (APD), converts the light pulses into an electric signal. <p> The most obvious performance limitations are due to transmission loss and pulse spreading (because of chromatic dispersion). Other (secondary) limitations are due to mode partition noise (when using multi-longitudinal-mode MLM lasers) and chirping <ref> [Lin89] </ref>. There are two wavelength windows usable for transmission on typical (single-mode) optical fiber [Gow84], [Hil90]. The shorter one is placed around 1300 nm, has a width of about 100 nm, and yields a fiber loss of about 0.4 dB/km together with a zero (material) dispersion at 1315 nm. <p> Associated with this, the refractive index of the active region of the laser changes as well, thus changing the output power. This incidental frequency modulation of the output signal is undesirable since it broadens the spectral width, with the consequence of performance limitation [MK88], <ref> [Lin89] </ref>, [Tos90]. At the present, the penalties of chirping are too large for practical consideration at high speeds (10 Gbit/s). Because of this, external modulators with low and controllable chirp parameters are considered for the encoding of the optical carrier generated (continuously) by the laser. <p> The main candidates for photodetector devices at multi-Gbit/s speeds are the III/V PIN diodes and the APD diodes [MK88], <ref> [Lin89] </ref>, [Tos90]. Receivers with APD diodes are generally superior to those using PIN diodes, because of a better sensitivity, of about 5 dB, but they are limited at present to maximum 10 GHz due to their avalanche buildup time. <p> This dispersion is related to the (temporal) pulse broadening when propagating through the (dispersive) optical fiber. It occurs because the laser sources are not monochromatic (as shown in Fig. 4-3) and because the refractive index of the glass varies with wavelength [Per81], <ref> [Lin89] </ref>, [Tos90]. Thus, different Fourier components of a pulse (i.e., laser wavelength/longitudinal mode, as shown in Fig. 4-3) propagate with different group velocities, which makes them arrive at destination at different times. <p> The receiver sensitivity degrades rapidly in this case and, because of that, t = T is considered as a practical limit (so-called dispersion limit) in dimensioning the length of transmission [Gow84], <ref> [Lin89] </ref>, [Aca90]. <p> Dispersion values up to - 5 psec/kmnm or less can be provided in this case for both the wavelength windows [Tos90]. On the other hand, the second solution involves the use of recently developed monochromatic laser sources with narrow linewidth (so-called single-frequency lasers) <ref> [Lin89] </ref>, [Tos90]. Such devices allow a propagation through fiber that is distorted only by the waveguide dispersion, since the material dispersion is practically eliminated. By this, very high speed data transmission can be provided over long distances. <p> For instance, the so-called mode partition noise, which is a limitation of type dispersion limitation, may impose even more stringent performance limitations in the case of large fiber dispersion D (larger than 0.1 psec/kmGhz) and W of the laser is away from the wavelength of minimum dispersion <ref> [Lin89] </ref>. This noise is due to the phenomenon of power distribution fluctuation among various longitudinal modes existent in Fabry-Perot multi-mode (MM) laser diodes. This leads to a fluctuating power distribution from pulse to pulse in a modulated pulse train, i.e., waveform fluctuations from pulse to pulse. <p> To minimize the mode partition noise, one needs to select the lasers so as to have a low reflection couplings to the fiber, as well as to adjust for optimum laser biasing and modulation conditions <ref> [Lin89] </ref>. This will minimize the noise, and system performance would then be due only to fiber transmission loss or dispersion alone. The conclusion is therefore that single-mode (SM) laser diodes are the optical sources of choice for multi-Gbit/s long distance transmissions.

Reference-contexts: Examples of network entities involved in a communication process are (virtual) configuration/topology, resource management, diverse 15 control/protocol mechanisms, transmission and switching schemes, etc. This approach corresponds to the hierarchical top-down system design process seen from the performance viewpoint, as treated in <ref> [Lyn72] </ref>. The new model of parallel communication put forth in this dissertation does not follow the standard layering approach of other LANs. Instead, a horizontally-oriented model is advanced for the communication process to open up all three fundamental bottlenecks.

Reference-contexts: The wavelength switching is a time-consuming process as well. Neither tunable lasers nor tunable filters are commercially available today that are capable of retuning speeds consistent with the packet/cell switching requirements (i.e., microseconds and less) over a sizable optical spectrum and for a large number of users [TIN86], [KC89], <ref> [LZ89] </ref>, [Bra90], [Ram93]. Nor are they likely to be available in the near future, since such technological breakthroughs are well beyond the current state of the art of lightwave technology [Bra90].

A distributed topology is used, with a distributed temporal switching function, in which each station has access to a small number of fixed-wavelength transmitters and receivers (coarse WDM).

Reference-contexts: The solution therefore seems to be to make use of dedicated hardware, as shown in [Dav93], <ref> [MC93] </ref>, [TS93]. Furthermore, the alternative solution of using large packet/cell sizes is not advantageous either, because it exacerbates the service bottleneck when integrating various types of traffic into the same data stream. Large packet/cell sizes are not advantageous for carrying mixed broadband traffic with different characteristics [BS91], [DJ92]. <p> Large packet/cell sizes are not advantageous for carrying mixed broadband traffic with different characteristics [BS91], [DJ92]. The question of the precise practical limit of such electro-optic interfaces is therefore still open, but it currently appears very difficult to extend the bit rate beyond 2.4 Gbit/s [Kle92], [Kun92], [McE92], <ref> [MC93] </ref>, [TS93].

This is due mainly to the extra processing needed for segmentation/reassembly of data packets into/from ATM cells, with the penalty of extra latency in data transport <ref> [MC93] </ref>, [ST93], [TS93]. The technique of (self-routing) fast packet switching used in ATM is not consistent with most actual WDMA architectures. The needed wavelength-agility, for instance, is currently beyond the state of the art [Bra90].

Reference-contexts: The queueing analysis of such a system is, however, a difficult task [VV90], [Zha91]. This analysis is further complicated by the fact that our model is a general one, i.e., of type multiple-station-multiple-server <ref> [MDeM+92] </ref>. Due to the fact that our main interest is focused on architectural aspects (specifically, on delay performance), further research on queue size and delay analysis, as well as dependence on traffic properties, is left to the future.

Reference-contexts: Wavelength-agile components are used for switching. Examples of such architectures are the Fast Optical Cross-connect (FOX), the Hypass and Bhypass Switches, the Photonic Knockout Switch [Goo89], the StarTrack Switch [LGA90], Rainbow [DGL+90], and others [HKS87], <ref> [Meh90] </ref>, [SGK91], [SBD92]. This architecture presents, however, fundamental difficulties when using distributed control [Ram93]. Typically, a star topology is used, with a central passive node to and from which all communication take place. <p> For instance, there is no need for wavelength agility as in other multiwavelength optical networks based on the wavelength-dedicated-to-user (WDU) concept [DGL+90], [LGA90], <ref> [Meh90] </ref>, [SGK91], [SBD92]. This greatly enlarges the area of applicability by opening up the service bottleneck. Fast packet switching services can be easily provided in this case without the need for technological breakthroughs, such as fast wavelength-agile components used at the electro-optic interface.

Reference-contexts: Admission control mechanisms acting at a burst level (fast reservation schemes) should be used. The error recovery schemes should work on an edge-to-edge or network basis [BSW91]. The flow control protocols should work on a preventive basis and be entirely dedicated to applications <ref> [MElZ90] </ref>. 1.2.2.3 Transport Mechanisms Ideally, "uniform control mechanisms" should be applied to the transport across the optical media. This is, however, extremely difficult because such an approach poses tremendous technical difficulties on the dimensioning of network elements and the allocation of resources to competing user applications. <p> The 13 processing involved here by the end-to-end protocols (and associated code) in different OSI layers is not keeping pace with the actual multi-Gbit/s rates on optical fibers [DDK+90], <ref> [MElZ90] </ref>, [DJ92]. To sustain 1 Gbit/s throughput, for instance, the station must process packets at a rate of 10,000 packets per second for (long) packets of 100 kbits length, and this figure approaches the actual limit for transport protocol processing rates [NRS90]. <p> Redundant (dis-persity) transmission/routing may be particularly useful for time-critical applications when two (or more) identical channels are provided (in different wavelengths) for the same information transport function <ref> [MElZ90] </ref>. This solution presents, however, the drawbacks of the need for data processing at high speed and resource wasting. Fast processing is required in this case to detect the presence of data errors at a slot level (i.e., "on the fly").

Reference-contexts: The errors in this case are isolated, statistically independent events. It is mentioned that the noise due to crosstalk among different wavelengths is ignored, since in our case, all channels have the same direction of transmission and, therefore, the power differences among them are minor <ref> [MK88] </ref>. <p> Associated with this, the refractive index of the active region of the laser changes as well, thus changing the output power. This incidental frequency modulation of the output signal is undesirable since it broadens the spectral width, with the consequence of performance limitation <ref> [MK88] </ref>, [Lin89], [Tos90]. At the present, the penalties of chirping are too large for practical consideration at high speeds (10 Gbit/s). Because of this, external modulators with low and controllable chirp parameters are considered for the encoding of the optical carrier generated (continuously) by the laser. <p> The main candidates for photodetector devices at multi-Gbit/s speeds are the III/V PIN diodes and the APD diodes <ref> [MK88] </ref>, [Lin89], [Tos90]. Receivers with APD diodes are generally superior to those using PIN diodes, because of a better sensitivity, of about 5 dB, but they are limited at present to maximum 10 GHz due to their avalanche buildup time.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the error performance depends mainly on the retiming/synchronization solution. Also, a potential risk exists in this case for errors that are no longer isolated in the case of jitter buildup. This (eventually) leads to synchronization failures, so-called cycle slips, causing bursts of errors <ref> [MPM86] </ref>. Adequate measures must be taken to reduce/ eliminate the accumulated jitter along with a regenerator chain. <p> These various sources of jitter lead to two different classes of jitter that deteriorate b, namely, random and systematic jitter <ref> [MPM86] </ref>, [TSC88]. Random jitter is, by definition, the jitter that is uncorrelated with the jitter generated by other regenerators. It is caused primarily by additive (thermal and shot) noises at the regenerator input stages and PLL internal noise. <p> Very low values for phase jitter (less than 10 psec) are easily obtainable in the case of large signal-to-noise ratio, i.e., and values for B L that are typically 10 -2 to 10 -4 of the clock frequency of 100 Mhz [CG86], <ref> [MPM86] </ref>. The conclusion, therefore, is that virtually jitter-free timing information cl_tr can be easily provided in all stations, which is used for transmission of data and control information onto the optical fiber.

Reference-contexts: Appropriate (design) solutions must therefore be chosen, according to these limits, to provide these requirements. 4.3 Quantum Limit In ideal optical transmission systems, the fundamental performance limitation is governed by photon statistics that is usually referred to as quantum noise [Per73a], [Per73b], [Bar76], <ref> [MS76] </ref>. This noise arises from the random nature of photons arrival and absorption at the optical detector (Fig. 4-1). Exactly when in time the photons are detected by the photodetector is random. <p> This device locks to the synch pulses (Fig. 3-4) and regenerates a local clock cl_rc of 100 Mhz with a very low duty cycle (i.e., pulses of 50 psec). No equalization is used to compensate for ISI distortion, as the expected performance is little (i.e., up to 3 dB <ref> [MS76] </ref>, [Per81]) compared to the simple integrate-and-dump filter used in our case, with the penalty of noise enhancement which can lower the SNR b in PLL. The mux/demux can be implemented by means of Sibipolar or GaAs MESFET gates and delay lines, as described in [BBT+82], [BE85], [KYS+89], [OYE+90], [HMM+91].

Reference-contexts: Each user transmits its information on an unique wavelength, and a pretransmission procedure is needed for the tuning of two end users to the same wavelength. Different alternative procedures are possible (reservation and pre-allocation strategies) <ref> [Muk92a] </ref>, [Ram93], but they all are time-consuming and cause high access delays [HKS87], [LGA90], [SGK91], [SBD92]. This means that this network model is not consistent with bursty traffic needs in terms of low access delay requirements. The wavelength switching is a time-consuming process as well. <p> Furthermore, there are a few new WDMA architectures that have been proposed with similar concepts of partitioning (in wavelength domain) the information traffic from the control traffic [HRS92], <ref> [Muk92a] </ref>, [Ram93]. Compared to these architectures, our architecture has two advantages. There is no need for fast-tunable transmitters and/or receivers (for information channels) where the tuning times are considerable shorter than the packet lengths.

Reference-contexts: The performance of this architecture is, however, deteriorated in the case of fixed routing and 8 realistic (nonuniform) load pattern <ref> [Muk92b] </ref>. The load imbalance, due to either traffic intensity variability or traffic pattern variability, has the effect of reducing throughput per station by a factor of 0.3 to 0.5 relative to that of balanced-load situation [EM88]. <p> Furthermore, since a packet goes through intermediate nodes (i.e., multiple hops) before reaching the destination node, network (bandwidth) resource is wasted. This poses difficult problems of routing. Sophisticated routing algorithms are required in this case to minimize the (average) number of hops <ref> [Muk92b] </ref>, [Ram93]. 1.2.1.2.3 Wavelength-Dedicated-to-Bit Approach Perhaps the most interesting WDMA architecture is the Photonic Interconnection Network proposed for multi-computer communication [SBR92]. This is a multihop architecture based on a dense WDM.

Because of that, (additional) power penalties must be considered when estimating the SNR a required to meet a specified error rate performance for an APD receiver. When a PIN photodetector is used, the shot noise can be considered to be negligible.

Reference-contexts: One can also take advantage of the coherence properties of light and use coherent systems with a sensitivity of about 10 dB better than direct detection systems [BB85].

To provide an error rate P e i of 10 -9 , a signal-to-noise ratio a = 12 (i.e., 21.6 dB) is required.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the ATM transport mechanism is not the best solution for temporal integration, since various anomalies heavily deteriorates the (mutual) synchronization performance [LG90b]. Furthermore, reducing jitter is very much harder in the case of independent data streams multiplexed onto a single channel than if these streams were completely separate <ref> [Nic90] </ref>. <p> It is also a significant requirement of future multimedia applications, where the need of synchronization provisions for real-time stream traffic, as well as preorchestrated stored data, has been identified [LG90a], [LG90b], <ref> [Nic90] </ref>, [Ste90]. As mentioned above, the future multimedia (computer) systems must be able to generate, process, store, retrieve, communicate and present complex data objects (including mixed data types) under conditions of extreme heterogeneity.

Reference-contexts: To sustain 1 Gbit/s throughput, for instance, the station must process packets at a rate of 10,000 packets per second for (long) packets of 100 kbits length, and this figure approaches the actual limit for transport protocol processing rates <ref> [NRS90] </ref>. This processing bottleneck has two components in terms of the increased ratios of (software) processing time to cell/packet transmission time and of propagation delay to cell/packet transmission time. <p> In the case of packetswitching, the main problems are related to the sophisticated processing required to interpret the packet header, which becomes the bottleneck at hundreds of Mbit/s and over [JSB90], <ref> [NRS90] </ref>, [LaPS91]. For packet-switching to remain attractive at high speeds in an integrated network environment, either the speed of the processing elements must be faster (technological limitations) or the size of packets must increase (problems with the service bottleneck).

Reference-contexts: Also, there is no need for the provision of network-wide synchronization to within a small fraction of the slot length, which may limit the network performance (in the case of multiple-clustering), as shown in <ref> [Ofe90] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For instance, the fiber can attenuate, delay and spread the transmitted pulses. Also, the opto-electric detection has a statistical behavior (which is based upon photon counting), and additive noise of different nature may corrupt the electrical signal after photodetection as well <ref> [Per81] </ref>. This picture is further complicated in our case by the presence of different channels/subnet-works, placed in different wavelengths, that must work in a time-synchronous fashion. <p> Also, to obtain an error rate of 10 -9 , about 21 photons/bit are required, or 10 photons per time interval. One can also calculate the optical receiver (photodetector) sensitivity required to achieve a particular error probability. The power contained in a digital data stream (with N photons/bit) is <ref> [Per81] </ref>, [Tos90] where R is the data rate and E is the energy of a photon. where h is Plancks constant; c is the speed of light (310 8 m/s); and w is the wavelength of photon. <p> No equalization is used to compensate for ISI distortion, as the expected performance is little (i.e., up to 3 dB [MS76], <ref> [Per81] </ref>) compared to the simple integrate-and-dump filter used in our case, with the penalty of noise enhancement which can lower the SNR b in PLL. The mux/demux can be implemented by means of Sibipolar or GaAs MESFET gates and delay lines, as described in [BBT+82], [BE85], [KYS+89], [OYE+90], [HMM+91]. <p> This dispersion is related to the (temporal) pulse broadening when propagating through the (dispersive) optical fiber. It occurs because the laser sources are not monochromatic (as shown in Fig. 4-3) and because the refractive index of the glass varies with wavelength <ref> [Per81] </ref>, [Lin89], [Tos90]. Thus, different Fourier components of a pulse (i.e., laser wavelength/longitudinal mode, as shown in Fig. 4-3) propagate with different group velocities, which makes them arrive at destination at different times. <p> Large signal-to-noise ratios b tr (of 55 to 65 dB), are easily obtainable for the clock cl_tr <ref> [Per81] </ref>, [Gow84]. It is known, from the theory of (PLL or BPF) tracking of sinusoidal signals that, when a stationary noise is present in additive form at the input of a clock extraction device, an approximate linear analysis is still possible when the signal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently large [Vit66], [Lin73]. <p> However, this is a solution where noise enhancement occurs. A specific trade-off must therefore be chosen between reduced ISI and noise enhancement <ref> [Per81] </ref>. The receive PLL device in the data channel has a filter tuned to the synch pulse repetition frequency of 100 Mhz, and a nonlinear phase detector with extremely high gain.

Reference-contexts: This drawback, which is specific for such architectures, refers to the difficulties in solving the (possible) contention when multiple packets, from a number of transmitters, must be simultaneously transmitted to the same receiver [Bra90]. One of the most interesting experiments, the STARNET architecture, is reported in <ref> [PG91] </ref>. This is a hybrid multichannel optical network implemented on a passive star topology. It provides support for both high-speed (100 Mbit/s) packet-switching applications and multi-Gbit/s (3 Gbit/s) circuit-switching interconnections. A coherent WDM technology is used for the detection of optical signals (dense WDM).

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the differentiation of w_niso_c control channel from w_niso_d data channel, together with the preemptive policy used in servicing diverse messages in w_niso_d, as well as the buffer insertion ring configuration used, reduces the clustering process (i.e., increased variability) in the interarrival times of packets/messages [BS83], <ref> [PY91] </ref>. Instead, it is now the service (i.e., transport) completion times that may get prolonged, i.e., we may get an increased variability (up to a limit given by the service frame F k serv ) in the service completion times.

Reference-contexts: transmission in one wavelength is essentially limited by the classical TDM technology, and the speed at which data may be switched in the spectral domain is still limited because of, for instance, the nonavailability of wavelength-agile components in a rapidly-tunable form (over a wide wavelength range and with high selectivity) <ref> [Ram93] </ref>. <p> Wavelength-agile components are used for switching. Examples of such architectures are the Fast Optical Cross-connect (FOX), the Hypass and Bhypass Switches, the Photonic Knockout Switch [Goo89], the StarTrack Switch [LGA90], Rainbow [DGL+90], and others [HKS87], [Meh90], [SGK91], [SBD92]. This architecture presents, however, fundamental difficulties when using distributed control <ref> [Ram93] </ref>. Typically, a star topology is used, with a central passive node to and from which all communication take place. Each user transmits its information on an unique wavelength, and a pretransmission procedure is needed for the tuning of two end users to the same wavelength. <p> Each user transmits its information on an unique wavelength, and a pretransmission procedure is needed for the tuning of two end users to the same wavelength. Different alternative procedures are possible (reservation and pre-allocation strategies) [Muk92a], <ref> [Ram93] </ref>, but they all are time-consuming and cause high access delays [HKS87], [LGA90], [SGK91], [SBD92]. This means that this network model is not consistent with bursty traffic needs in terms of low access delay requirements. The wavelength switching is a time-consuming process as well. <p> Neither tunable lasers nor tunable filters are commercially available today that are capable of retuning speeds consistent with the packet/cell switching requirements (i.e., microseconds and less) over a sizable optical spectrum and for a large number of users [TIN86], [KC89], [LZ89], [Bra90], <ref> [Ram93] </ref>. Nor are they likely to be available in the near future, since such technological breakthroughs are well beyond the current state of the art of lightwave technology [Bra90]. <p> Furthermore, since a packet goes through intermediate nodes (i.e., multiple hops) before reaching the destination node, network (bandwidth) resource is wasted. This poses difficult problems of routing. Sophisticated routing algorithms are required in this case to minimize the (average) number of hops [Muk92b], <ref> [Ram93] </ref>. 1.2.1.2.3 Wavelength-Dedicated-to-Bit Approach Perhaps the most interesting WDMA architecture is the Photonic Interconnection Network proposed for multi-computer communication [SBR92]. This is a multihop architecture based on a dense WDM. <p> Furthermore, there are a few new WDMA architectures that have been proposed with similar concepts of partitioning (in wavelength domain) the information traffic from the control traffic [HRS92], [Muk92a], <ref> [Ram93] </ref>. Compared to these architectures, our architecture has two advantages. There is no need for fast-tunable transmitters and/or receivers (for information channels) where the tuning times are considerable shorter than the packet lengths. <p> A Connectionless (CL) procedure is proposed for nonisochronous traffic, with a distributed MAC protocol working at a packet level, and with a congestion-tolerant control mechanism based on dynamic resource adjustment (implemented with multiple registers inserted in the data channel). Furthermore, a fast reservation scheme (so-called "tell and go" [HRS92], <ref> [Ram93] </ref>) is used for resource allocation to provide low access delays. Under such a scheme, a station simply informs the destination station (on the control channel) that it is transmitting a packet and goes ahead and does this in the next frame (in data channel).

A common feature of most existing networks is the fact that they usually make use of a common universal multiaccess mechanism for all types of traffic, and this mechanism is acting at low temporal scale, i.e., at packet or cell level (so-called in-call control).

Control mechanisms based on reactive (adaptive feedback) algorithms operating within the network under very hard temporal constraints (decided according to performance needs of applications and architectural solutions for network), are required in this case. Such mechanisms are not suitable for broadband networks [Jai90a]. <p> The conclusion, therefore, is that no single mechanisms is able to meet the needs for all classes of traffic and users, and this calls for a proper set of control mechanisms [RD91a], <ref> [RD91b] </ref>, Class 1 Class 2 Class k Demanded Resources Available Resource&gt; 46 Usually, contention resolution schemes can be classified as resource creation mechanisms or demand reduction mechanisms (service denial, service degradation or scheduling schemes). <p> They can be of reactive or preventive (prediction based) nature, and may act at diverse temporal scales (network-, call-, burst-, packet and/or cell-level) [Jai90a], [LP91], <ref> [RD91b] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: However, monolithic multiple-wavelength laser diode arrays with hundreds of lasers and corresponding integrated detector arrays are needed for each station! Actually, such components are extremely difficult to implement, and likely be in the near future [C-HMH+91], <ref> [Rog91] </ref>. Thus, there is a definite need for better WDMA architectures targeted to effectively share the vast optical bandwidth resource available on optical fiber among distributed users with diverse and conflicting traffic needs, and with peak traffic constraints because of the limited speed of electronics at the electro-optic interface.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, such architectures are not advantageous for services with strict latency and jitter constraints (real-time traffic). Apart from the drawback of large delay variances [Ban90], <ref> [Ros92] </ref>, these networks suffer also because of the need to reassemble the received data in a correct sequence, a time-and buffer-consuming process. Furthermore, since a packet goes through intermediate nodes (i.e., multiple hops) before reaching the destination node, network (bandwidth) resource is wasted. This poses difficult problems of routing.

Reference-contexts: Actually, high speed lasers for use at bit rates up to about 2.5 Gbit/s are commercially available, and 10 Gbit/s lasers are expected in the near future [MHS+90], [Mil91], <ref> [RTS92] </ref>, for applications such as SONET based systems (standard STS-192 of 9.953 Gbit/s). One serious factor that may limit the bit rate distance (BL) performance at very high bit rates, in the case of directly modulated lasers, is due to the transient phenomenon of chirping. <p> Because of this, external modulators with low and controllable chirp parameters are considered for the encoding of the optical carrier generated (continuously) by the laser.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, each type of traffic differs in its admissible access and transit latencies, jitter (delay dispersion), end-to-end loss sensitivities, reliability, need for sequenced delivery, etc. Additional synchronization requirements, such as inter-media synchronization facilities across two or more real-time channels in a multimedia communication/retrieval [LG90a], <ref> [RVR92] </ref>, further complicate this picture. So the understanding of application requirements is a prerequisite for the proper design of future high-performance networks. Generally, the incoming traffic can be divided into two main classes, isochronous (real-time) and nonisochronous (non real-time) , each with distinct performance requirements [GRV90], [RB90], [BS91], [RD91b].

Reference-contexts: allocation mechanism used for nonisochronous traffic. 50 2.2.4.4 Application-Oriented Multiaccess Mechanisms To date, a multitude of multiaccess mechanisms are identified in three different categories (fixed assignment, demand assignment and random access), which are provided in various domains (time, frequency/wavelength, etc.), and act at different temporal scales (call/session, burst, packet, cell) <ref> [Sac88] </ref>, [RB90]. A common feature of most existing networks is the fact that they usually make use of a common universal multiaccess mechanism for all types of traffic, and this mechanism is acting at low temporal scale, i.e., at packet or cell level (so-called in-call control). <p> Such a concept offers the potential of relieving the processing bottleneck within multiaccess protocols by trading-off diverse characteristics of applications (like large access delays for isochronous traffic and non-isochronicity in the transport of nonisochronous data) for protocol simplifications. Due to better performance shown at high data rates <ref> [Sac88] </ref>, multiaccess schemes based on demand assignment (of type reservation) are considered here. Under such a scheme, a separate control channel, shared among all stations on a collision-free basis, is used to allow certain network entities be informed about the transmission demands of the stations. <p> Two control channels, w_iso_c and w_niso_c, placed in two distinct wavelengths, are dedicated to multiaccess mechanisms for isochronous, and nonisochronous traffic. 151 Due to better performance shown at high data rates <ref> [Sac88] </ref>, multiaccess schemes based on demand assignment (of type reservation) are considered here.

Reference-contexts: The service bottleneck is consequently exacerbated, as it is very difficult to guarantee requested QoS for all traffic classes [CP90], [BS91], [Gre92]. We ignore other alternatives, like common resources in code domain, because of their poor 36 ness in terms of spectral efficiency, which results in low throughput performance <ref> [Sal89] </ref>. Because of the large bandwidth-delay products in a multigigabit network, resource allocation mechanisms that are optimal over time and fair to all traffic classes are extremely hard to achieve in the case of common resource pools [BS91], [LP91], [RD91b].

Reference-contexts: Wavelength-agile components are used for switching. Examples of such architectures are the Fast Optical Cross-connect (FOX), the Hypass and Bhypass Switches, the Photonic Knockout Switch [Goo89], the StarTrack Switch [LGA90], Rainbow [DGL+90], and others [HKS87], [Meh90], [SGK91], <ref> [SBD92] </ref>. This architecture presents, however, fundamental difficulties when using distributed control [Ram93]. Typically, a star topology is used, with a central passive node to and from which all communication take place. <p> Different alternative procedures are possible (reservation and pre-allocation strategies) [Muk92a], [Ram93], but they all are time-consuming and cause high access delays [HKS87], [LGA90], [SGK91], <ref> [SBD92] </ref>. This means that this network model is not consistent with bursty traffic needs in terms of low access delay requirements. The wavelength switching is a time-consuming process as well. <p> For instance, there is no need for wavelength agility as in other multiwavelength optical networks based on the wavelength-dedicated-to-user (WDU) concept [DGL+90], [LGA90], [Meh90], [SGK91], <ref> [SBD92] </ref>. This greatly enlarges the area of applicability by opening up the service bottleneck. Fast packet switching services can be easily provided in this case without the need for technological breakthroughs, such as fast wavelength-agile components used at the electro-optic interface.

Reference-contexts: This poses difficult problems of routing. Sophisticated routing algorithms are required in this case to minimize the (average) number of hops [Muk92b], [Ram93]. 1.2.1.2.3 Wavelength-Dedicated-to-Bit Approach Perhaps the most interesting WDMA architecture is the Photonic Interconnection Network proposed for multi-computer communication <ref> [SBR92] </ref>. This is a multihop architecture based on a dense WDM. A Wavelength-Dedicated-to-Bit (WDB) concept is used, and the communication is done using word-wide parallel transmission through parallel optical channels placed in different wavelengths. By this, communication networks resembling extension of computer busses can be easily developed. <p> Finally, future computing environments based on parallel-processing supercomputers require better solutions for multigigabit photonic interconnects with (throughput) performances limited by optics, and not by electronics <ref> [SBR92] </ref>, [VDK92]. A Wavelength Division Multi-Access (WDMA) architecture is considered in design that is based on the Wavelength-Dedicated-to-Application (WDA) concept. Isochronous and nonisochro-nous traffic with arbitrary bit rates, both narrowband and broadband, should be supported.

Reference-contexts: The sharing/scheduling mechanism to achieve equalization of the blocking probabilities among different isochronous traffic, with different offered loads and bandwidth requirements, is implemented in the master station, and is based on the policy used for resource partitioning. It can, for instance, be designed by using the (multidimensional) Erlang formula <ref> [Sch87] </ref> in the case of fixed resource partitioning. Furthermore, because of the fact that the w_iso_c channel is dimensioned such that, practically, there is no congestion in this channel, the problem of resource partitioning in this channel is superfluous. <p> The best example of partial sharing policy is given by the movable boundary strategy, which is used for integration of voice and data traffic in the same TDM temporal frame [KS84], [KS85], <ref> [Sch87] </ref>. This policy increases the efficiency of channel usage (when compared to the complete partitioning policy) at the expense of protocol sophistication. <p> the blocking probability P B,l tc (time congestion) for class l traffic (where 1 l k), in a generic loss system with X l iso inputs (homogeneous sources) and Y l iso outputs (where X l iso &gt; Y l iso ), can be calculated with the generalized Erlang formula <ref> [Sch87] </ref> where every user either is idle (in the case of class l traffic) for an (exponential) period of average (l iso,l ) -1 , or (eventually) generates a call with (exponential) call/session time of average ( m iso,l ) -1 . <p> The loss probability P B,l cc (call congestion) for a number of X l iso inputs can be calculated with the Engset formula [Sys60], [Kr87], <ref> [Sch87] </ref> where P B,l tc (X l iso -1) is the blocking probability (time congestion) for (X l iso -1) inputs (eq. 5.26). 5.2.2 Performance Evaluation The performance of a class of centralized MAC protocols for isochronous traffic is evaluated in terms of their main parameters of interest, i.e., the call <p> When X l iso , the Engset distribution provides best approximation for the model statistics. However, when X l iso &gt;> Y l iso and l iso,l --&gt; 0, the model is better captured with Erlang distribution <ref> [Sch87] </ref>. For X l iso , an usual binomial distribution is obtained. Fig. 5-15 shows an example of network dimensioning to have fair (i.e., balancing of) blocking probabilities among different classes of traffic, in the case of three classes of traffic and a fixed resource partitioning in w_iso_d.

Reference-contexts: The randomly multiplied (transistor) shot noise associated with the amplification and detection processes may also affect the output signal. This noise is, however, ignored in this model, since it is several orders of magnitude less than the thermal electronic energy in the electronic circuits <ref> [Sch90] </ref>. 99 The photodiode is modeled as an ideal photodetector followed by a random carrier multiplier with known statistics. The photodetector gain g n is a random variable modeling the number of secondary carriers generated by each (primary) photon-induced carrier. <p> Also, the (tab ulated) complementary error function erfc (a) has the expression <ref> [Sch90] </ref> P e i P i r i 0 ] p 1 i t i ( ) V i &lt; a k P e i f rs x a k R 0 0 ) erfc V i x dx i f rs x ( a k R 1 + 1 ) <p> Modeling the thermal noise added by a (pre)amplifier as a Gaussian noise with a flat power spectral density in the range up to multi-Gbit/s <ref> [Sch90] </ref>, means that a signal-to-noise ratio a of about 23 dB is needed at the receiver in order to provide an error rate P e of 10 -12 . <p> The main noise source that still deteriorates the extracted clock signal in this case is due to the additive Gaussian thermal noise, introduced in the receiver amplifier, with very low spectral densities <ref> [Sch90] </ref>. Large signal-to-noise ratios b tr (of 55 to 65 dB), are easily obtainable for the clock cl_tr [Per81], [Gow84].

Reference-contexts: This jitter, called systematic, is correlated with the jitter generated by other regenerators in the transmission chain, and it dominates at large input signal levels. Because of their deterministic nature, the different systematic jitter components from tandem stations add on a linear basis and cannot be reduced by filtering <ref> [SE77] </ref>, [TSC88]. Systematic jitter includes two components, namely, the Duty Cycle Distortion Jitter (DCDJ) and the Data Dependent Jitter (DDJ) [Han90]. The first component is mainly caused by asymmetries of rise/fall times in the received pulses. <p> Because of its characteristics, systematic jitter builds up much faster than random jitter in a chain of self-timed regenerators <ref> [SE77] </ref>, [KMM83], [TS88]. This decisively impacts on link and network performances, such as bit error rate P e , maximum allowable distance between regenerators and maximum number of stations in cascade around the ring. <p> Because of the elimination of accumulated systematic jitter, as well as the Gaussian nature of jitter J a x (t), low power penalties (less than 0.5 dB) can be easily provided for J a x (t) with optimum values for w PLL and x <ref> [SE77] </ref>, [KMM83], [TSC88]. Furthermore, it is noted, from subsection 4.5.7, that the penalty due to jitter and static phase offset does still not affect network performances, e.g., maximum distance between stations and speed in data channels, which are limited by dispersion in optical fiber only.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, due to the minimal (cost) communication path between two processes, distributed shared memory model seems to be the model of preference for highspeed inter-process communication <ref> [SF91] </ref>. Here, the very bursty traffic generated by memory requests will be a major component of the total traffic. Traffic in the future multigigabit LANs is therefore expected to be extremely bursty due to the diversity of applications [FL91], [Kun92].

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, suitable algorithms to support real-time presentation of concurrent media to the application (continuous synchronization) are required as well. On a low level, the transport layer must provide Stream Synchronization. This has two components, namely a local synchronization (node-to-node) and a global synchronization (network synchronization) [LGH+85], [Kar91], <ref> [SL91] </ref>. The synchronization system must account for different and variable latencies of the component elements from source to destination (i.e., links and intermediate nodes), to support the transmission of multiple data streams. Synchronization capabilities across these data streams must be provided at a low level (local synchronization). <p> One of the problems with 118 this method is the proper dimensioning of the elastic buffer, or equivalently, the dimensioning of the idle periods in order to compensate for phase drifts between the clocks. Furthermore, at a 10 Gbit/s rate, a very good atomic clock generator may be required <ref> [SL91] </ref>. Even then, this method may not be practically feasible due to technological difficulties in getting the appropriate electronics to run at such a very high speed. Also, extra difficulties related to proper line coding/decoding at very high speeds further complicates this solution [YNY86].

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, by removing messages at their destinations (as we do in w_niso_d), ring networks with buffer insertion improve the average throughput efficiency (when compared with other protocols) by a factor of two in the case of uniform and symmetric traffic, irrespective of the number of stations <ref> [SM83] </ref>. In other words, the ring as a whole can carry twice as much traffic 208 as a single link.

Reference-contexts: Some of these requirements are presented in Table 2 <ref> [Spe87] </ref>, [HSS90], [DN91]. The main observation that can be done is therefore related to the wide variety of both traffic characteristics and performance requirements needed to be provided by the transport system.

Reference-contexts: However, it is less advantageous for time-critical (computer) communications, such as in distributed computing applications. This is due mainly to the extra processing needed for segmentation/reassembly of data packets into/from ATM cells, with the penalty of extra latency in data transport [MC93], <ref> [ST93] </ref>, [TS93]. The technique of (self-routing) fast packet switching used in ATM is not consistent with most actual WDMA architectures. The needed wavelength-agility, for instance, is currently beyond the state of the art [Bra90].

Reference-contexts: Unidirectional or bidirectional links can be used for station-to-station interconnection. In the last case, link differentiation can be done either in wavelength domain (single fiber) or in space domain (two distinct fibers). Also, the network topology can be regular or irregular. Given their advantages <ref> [Sta87] </ref>, [BL92], ring-based architectures will be considered in our study. These are attractive mainly because of their distributed structure, flexibility, trivial routing, (relative) simple control mechanisms, fairness, etc. Also, different (hybrid) physical topologies, e.g., star-ring, are of interest when considering the reduction of propagation delay for time-critical applications.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, it is well recognized that the self-noise jitter component is strongly dependent on the shape of the incoming data pulses at the input of the (nonlinear) clock extraction device [FB74], <ref> [Tak80] </ref>, [DMM86]. Accordingly, pulse shapes exist that greatly reduce or even eliminate the self-noise for properly designed synchronizers. <p> The A 55 to 65 dB 4.34 ( )= 124 consequence is that the self-noise is further reduced in the case of practical pulse shapes like Spectral Raised Cosine (SRC), or Quasi-Locally Symmetric (QLS) <ref> [Tak80] </ref>, [DMM86]. However, this is a solution where noise enhancement occurs. A specific trade-off must therefore be chosen between reduced ISI and noise enhancement [Per81].

Reference-contexts: Congestion-tolerant, loosely coupled control algorithms embedded in the network stations are required. Furthermore, given the large bandwidth-delay products existent in a multigigabit optical network (effect of the finite speed-of-light latency), some forms of managing the indeterminism of state in stations must be also envisaged <ref> [TF93] </ref>. 2.1.2 Pipelining the Communication Process There are four general methods of resolving conflicts in a (centralized or distributed) system, i.e., queueing, splitting, blocking and smashing [Kle90]. They have different consequences and are applicable to communication services as well. <p> Given the large bandwidth-delay products available in a multigigabit optical network, such a pipeline model is effective only when the application layer generates large messages (or files) that are larger than the bandwidth-delay product of Layer 0, to prevent latency-bounded communication [Kle92], <ref> [TF93] </ref>. For instance, in [Kle92] it is shown that, to accommodate propagation delays (T Stage0 ) of 15 milliseconds, gigabit channels begin to pay off only for large message sizes of 10 Megabits or more. This communication model may, therefore, become performance-limited. <p> One solution to this problem seems to be to make use of prediction and to send sets of messages in anticipation as proposed in <ref> [TF93] </ref>. <p> Effective flow control cannot, therefore, be achieved in this case [DDK+90], [LaPS91]. 53 Rate-based flow control mechanisms are proposed in the literature as an alternative solution to generate a smoother transmission pattern, to the benefit of transport network and users [DDK+90], [LaPS91], <ref> [TF93] </ref>. Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that such a control mechanism is not faster than the window-based mechanism (because of its reactive nature). We consider that an appropriate solution for end-to-end flow control in a multigigabit environment (with focus on latency) is a preventive one.

Reference-contexts: We believe, in contrast, that solutions where the service controller is based solely on the aggregate traffic of each class (so-called rate-based servers) are more advantageous, due to their simplicity and the choice to open up the processing bottleneck. Examples of such mechanisms are Stop-and-Go [Gol91a], [Gol91b], <ref> [TG92] </ref> and Hierarchical Round Robin (HRR) [KKK90]. These mechanisms, which are based on using diverse time-framing strategies, do not need to monitor the 195 individual packets at every switching node. <p> Finally: In a similar way: The conclusion therefore is that, to provide worst-case performance guarantees, a DTS network has a size that is upper bounded to: for any k. At this point, the fundamental differences that exist between this approach, called DTS, and the Stop-and-Go approach <ref> [TG92] </ref>, need to be pointed out. They refer partly to the conservation of smoothness properties, partly to end-to-end delay.

Neither tunable lasers nor tunable filters are commercially available today that are capable of retuning speeds consistent with the packet/cell switching requirements (i.e., microseconds and less) over a sizable optical spectrum and for a large number of users <ref> [TIN86] </ref>, [KC89], [LZ89], [Bra90], [Ram93]. Nor are they likely to be available in the near future, since such technological breakthroughs are well beyond the current state of the art of lightwave technology [Bra90].

Reference-contexts: This means that the switching architecture must provide appropriate transfer of data from one user to another user in such a way to flexibly meet the desired grade of service (such as throughput, delay or blocking performance) for all traffic classes. There are two main switching techniques [Hui90], <ref> [Tob90] </ref>: circuit-switching, with poor bandwidth utilization, but with relative simplicity of the access mechanism; and packet-switching, with high service flexibility and network efficiency, but with sophisti cated control algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Today, new multi-Gbit/s optical integrated networks, which carry simultaneously diverse real-time synchronous traffic, intra-system traffic with stringent latency requirements, and inter-system traffic, are under development [BCF+92], [Che92], [Gre92], [KBH+92], [Kun92], <ref> [Tol92] </ref>. However, while the Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technique has further manifoldly increased the transmission capacity on optical fiber [Bra90], the performance increase of supporting nodal electronics and (software) processing needed for switching, buffering and control purposes has not matched this trend. <p> is implemented either in electrical domain, or in optical domain. 1.2.1.1.1 TDM in Electrical Domain This solution is used by most actual monowavelength systems such as the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) [FDD87], the FDDI Follow-On (FFOL) [LR91], the Distributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB) [DQD88], the High-Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) <ref> [Tol92] </ref>, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) [BS91] in combination with the Synchronous Optical Network E O E O Monowavelength Optical Network Station Station Station Station 21 w w E/O: electro-optic interface 5 (SONET) [Che92]. These systems are of architectures that do not take advantage of the lightwave technology capabilities. <p> executing 50 Millions of Instructions Per Second (MIPS), is used, then only up to 20 instructions are allowed to process an ATM cell header of 5 bytes! And this figure gets even worse at higher speeds, where the technological limitations in electronics and processing deteriorate the performance even more [McE92], <ref> [Tol92] </ref>. The solution therefore seems to be to make use of dedicated hardware, as shown in [Dav93], [MC93], [TS93]. Furthermore, the alternative solution of using large packet/cell sizes is not advantageous either, because it exacerbates the service bottleneck when integrating various types of traffic into the same data stream.

Reference-contexts: on optical fiber, three fundamental bottlenecks must be removed when communicating according to the vertically-oriented Open System Interconnection (OSI) model (Fig. 1-1). 1.2.1 Electro-Optic Bottleneck Although the optical bandwidth resource available on single-mode fiber in the two low-loss windows (1300 nm and 1550 nm) is huge (more than 30 Tbit/s) <ref> [Tos90] </ref>, the electronic components at the network nodes (typically operating at rates up to about 1 Gbit/s), as well as improper architectural solutions, drastically limit the total end-user throughput. <p> One can also calculate the optical receiver (photodetector) sensitivity required to achieve a particular error probability. The power contained in a digital data stream (with N photons/bit) is [Per81], <ref> [Tos90] </ref> where R is the data rate and E is the energy of a photon. where h is Plancks constant; c is the speed of light (310 8 m/s); and w is the wavelength of photon. <p> Only a single (fundamental) mode/ray of propagation is possible in this case and, thus, no modal dispersion exists <ref> [Tos90] </ref>. This light mode may, as it propagates through optical fiber, be (actually) characterized by a near-Gaussian power distribution with some fraction of the power travelling in the cladding. The most obvious performance limitations are due to transmission loss and pulse spreading (because of chromatic dispersion). <p> Furthermore, their superior spatial coherency allows for high launching efficiency when launching into the small core of the single-mode fiber <ref> [Tos90] </ref>. Actually, high speed lasers for use at bit rates up to about 2.5 Gbit/s are commercially available, and 10 Gbit/s lasers are expected in the near future [MHS+90], [Mil91], [RTS92], for applications such as SONET based systems (standard STS-192 of 9.953 Gbit/s). <p> Associated with this, the refractive index of the active region of the laser changes as well, thus changing the output power. This incidental frequency modulation of the output signal is undesirable since it broadens the spectral width, with the consequence of performance limitation [MK88], [Lin89], <ref> [Tos90] </ref>. At the present, the penalties of chirping are too large for practical consideration at high speeds (10 Gbit/s). Because of this, external modulators with low and controllable chirp parameters are considered for the encoding of the optical carrier generated (continuously) by the laser. <p> The main candidates for photodetector devices at multi-Gbit/s speeds are the III/V PIN diodes and the APD diodes [MK88], [Lin89], <ref> [Tos90] </ref>. Receivers with APD diodes are generally superior to those using PIN diodes, because of a better sensitivity, of about 5 dB, but they are limited at present to maximum 10 GHz due to their avalanche buildup time. The electrical bandwidth of an APD diode B APD can be approximated [Tos90] <p> <ref> [Tos90] </ref>. Receivers with APD diodes are generally superior to those using PIN diodes, because of a better sensitivity, of about 5 dB, but they are limited at present to maximum 10 GHz due to their avalanche buildup time. The electrical bandwidth of an APD diode B APD can be approximated [Tos90] by where B a is the (achievable) bandwidth due to avalanche buildup and B i is the intrinsic device bandwidth. <p> f rs x ( a k R 1 + 1 ) erfc V i x+- dx 4.16 ( )= = = erfc a ( ) 2 e a db 4.17 ( )= 108 The shot noise generated in an APD can be considered as a filtered doubly stochastic process [Gow84], <ref> [Tos90] </ref>. The amplitude distribution of the multiplied shot noise depends on the statistics of the avalanche carrier generation process, a (theoretical) model that is not yet known explicitly [Gow84], [Nak90]. <p> This dispersion is related to the (temporal) pulse broadening when propagating through the (dispersive) optical fiber. It occurs because the laser sources are not monochromatic (as shown in Fig. 4-3) and because the refractive index of the glass varies with wavelength [Per81], [Lin89], <ref> [Tos90] </ref>. Thus, different Fourier components of a pulse (i.e., laser wavelength/longitudinal mode, as shown in Fig. 4-3) propagate with different group velocities, which makes them arrive at destination at different times. <p> The first alternative is based on using optical fibers with more complex refractive index profiles, where the dispersion characteristics can be flattened to small values over the whole bandwidth of interest (so-called dispersion-flattened fibers) [Gow84], <ref> [Tos90] </ref>. Dispersion values up to - 5 psec/kmnm or less can be provided in this case for both the wavelength windows [Tos90]. On the other hand, the second solution involves the use of recently developed monochromatic laser sources with narrow linewidth (so-called single-frequency lasers) [Lin89], [Tos90]. <p> using optical fibers with more complex refractive index profiles, where the dispersion characteristics can be flattened to small values over the whole bandwidth of interest (so-called dispersion-flattened fibers) [Gow84], <ref> [Tos90] </ref>.

Such devices allow a propagation through fiber that is distorted only by the waveguide dispersion, since the material dispersion is practically eliminated. By this, very high speed data transmission can be provided over long distances. <p> This means that about 8000 photons/bit (or an average of 4000 photons in a binary interval) are provided at reception for a power-budget limit of 19 dB. This is greater than the figures required by the available photodiode devices as mentioned in [Bra90], <ref> [Tos90] </ref>, [CB91]. 114 Assuming that a large margin of 10 dB is left for wavelength mux/demux and other unaccounted losses (coupling, etc.), a loss budget of 9 dB will be left for the dispersion limit degradation (i.e., 3 dB) and for the optical fiber link loss. <p> Examples of dispersion-flattened fibers are the W-fiber or the fiber with multiple cladding, with group delay performances which comply with the group delay limits required in Table 5 <ref> [Tos90] </ref>. Accordingly, longer distances are expected between stations (than those shown in Table 3) because of the smaller dispersion values of such fibers. Though dispersion-flattened fibers are extremely attractive for multiwavelength systems, they have, however, characteristics that actually are very sensitive to a large number of diverse parameters. <p> Though dispersion-flattened fibers are extremely attractive for multiwavelength systems, they have, however, characteristics that actually are very sensitive to a large number of diverse parameters. Very strict production tolerances are therefore needed and sophisticated fabrication technology is required, making these fibers expensive <ref> [Tos90] </ref>. A solution for less stringent group delay limits is provided when every application has its own clock (and clock distribution channel). For instance, all channels belonging to the isochronous traffic, inclusive a clock distribution channel, can be grouped in the 1300 nm wavelength window.

Reference-contexts: Assuming the case of zero static phase offset in PLL, signal-to-noise ratios b rc of about 50 dB or more can be provided for the receive clock signal cl_rc_x on the regeneration section, also shown in [BBT+82], [BE85], <ref> [TS87] </ref>. These values are much larger than the power-budget margin a of 16 dB (subsection 4.5.7). Accordingly, negligible jitter peaks of 10 psec or less are obtainable for this clock signal. However, the static phase offset is difficult to set and may be temperature dependent. <p> The retiming circuit regenerates the timing information s r x (t) from the received signal i r x (t). This is a sinus wave of frequency 1/T s , which can be expressed as [Ben58], [FB74], <ref> [TS87] </ref> i r i, k -= a k i h r tr x 1-, l i T s 2 n 2+( ) T 4.37 ( )= rc x, l i rc x, +[ ] 2i 1+( ) T dl i rc x, dl i s r 2pt J x - t <p> The extracted timing signal cl_rc_x is further used for "sampling" the received data in the decision circuit, as shown in Fig. 4-13.

Reference-contexts: Because of its characteristics, systematic jitter builds up much faster than random jitter in a chain of self-timed regenerators [SE77], [KMM83], <ref> [TS88] </ref>. This decisively impacts on link and network performances, such as bit error rate P e , maximum allowable distance between regenerators and maximum number of stations in cascade around the ring.

Furthermore, the alternative solution of using large packet/cell sizes is not advantageous either, because it exacerbates the service bottleneck when integrating various types of traffic into the same data stream. Large packet/cell sizes are not advantageous for carrying mixed broadband traffic with different characteristics [BS91], [DJ92]. <p> Large packet/cell sizes are not advantageous for carrying mixed broadband traffic with different characteristics [BS91], [DJ92]. The question of the precise practical limit of such electro-optic interfaces is therefore still open, but it currently appears very difficult to extend the bit rate beyond 2.4 Gbit/s [Kle92], [Kun92], [McE92], [MC93], <ref> [TS93] </ref>. Technological breakthroughs are still needed in the electrical domain to open up the service and processing bottlenecks, for the case of single electro-optic interface operating at multi-Gbit/s rates. 1.2.1.1.2 TDM in Optical Domain Another concurrent technique is that of the TDM in optical domain [PSS86], [PBS87], [Hin92]. <p> However, it is less advantageous for time-critical (computer) communications, such as in distributed computing applications. This is due mainly to the extra processing needed for segmentation/reassembly of data packets into/from ATM cells, with the penalty of extra latency in data transport [MC93], [ST93], <ref> [TS93] </ref>. The technique of (self-routing) fast packet switching used in ATM is not consistent with most actual WDMA architectures. The needed wavelength-agility, for instance, is currently beyond the state of the art [Bra90].

Reference-contexts: These various sources of jitter lead to two different classes of jitter that deteriorate b, namely, random and systematic jitter [MPM86], <ref> [TSC88] </ref>. Random jitter is, by definition, the jitter that is uncorrelated with the jitter generated by other regenerators. It is caused primarily by additive (thermal and shot) noises at the regenerator input stages and PLL internal noise. <p> This jitter component dominates at low input signal levels and it adds on a power basis (i.e., r.m.s.). It can, therefore, be reduced by a proper filtering in the PLL device [KMM83], <ref> [TSC88] </ref>. The major contribution to the timing jitter is, however, caused by data randomness, ISI distortion and PLL hardware imperfections (in terms of static phase offset/deviations). <p> Because of their deterministic nature, the different systematic jitter components from tandem stations add on a linear basis and cannot be reduced by filtering [SE77], <ref> [TSC88] </ref>. Systematic jitter includes two components, namely, the Duty Cycle Distortion Jitter (DCDJ) and the Data Dependent Jitter (DDJ) [Han90]. The first component is mainly caused by asymmetries of rise/fall times in the received pulses. <p> Because of the elimination of accumulated systematic jitter, as well as the Gaussian nature of jitter J a x (t), low power penalties (less than 0.5 dB) can be easily provided for J a x (t) with optimum values for w PLL and x [SE77], [KMM83], <ref> [TSC88] </ref>. Furthermore, it is noted, from subsection 4.5.7, that the penalty due to jitter and static phase offset does still not affect network performances, e.g., maximum distance between stations and speed in data channels, which are limited by dispersion in optical fiber only.

Reference-contexts: These are topics that are developed in detail in Chapter 5.

Two counters are maintained for a given traffic stream/ packet entering the station. Each time a packet/data is offered, the contents of these counters are compared to some specific thresholds. If the both counters are below these thresholds, the packet is admitted and the counters are incremented.

The fundamental issue of the dominance of propagation delay in the face of very high transport speeds and highly bursty traffic, with diverse characteristics, means that reactive (adaptive feedback) control algorithms are not suitable for broadband networks [HS91], [Kle92], [YM92].

Reference-contexts: In addition to existing communication services (like the ubiquitous voice, file transfer, etc.), future networks must also support broadband interactive services (of type conversational, messaging and retrieval) [CCI88]. The emerging services are of various types for multi-media (voice, video and/or data), multi-rate and multi-point communications [Lid90], <ref> [WT90] </ref>. Accordingly, the incoming traffic is highly heterogeneous in its characteristics and performance requirements, with different and contradictory (bandwidth) resource demands, holding times and call/session arrival rates. <p> Furthermore, isochronous traffic can not tolerate excessive delays, or large delay variances, in delivery (isochronicity requirements) <ref> [WT90] </ref>. This means that the underlying transport network must work in extreme conditions, such as the highest possible transmission speed and a minimum processing delay for multiaccess and transport protocols.

Reference-contexts: A priority structure is created among these traffic subclasses. For instance, the most stringent needs are met in the case of distributed computation models, where the transmission of short messages is more crucial to the performance than the transmission of long messages [Fer90], <ref> [WTS92] </ref>. Fairness is enforced, in this case, by ordering the nonisochronous applications according to their admissible latencies. Furthermore, a dynamic resourcesharing mechanism is used to allocate the w_niso_d resources to different subclasses of nonisochronous traffic. Within a single subclass, fairness is provided on a First-Come-First-Served (FIFS) basis.

Reference-contexts: The fundamental issue of the dominance of propagation delay in the face of very high transport speeds and highly bursty traffic, with diverse characteristics, means that reactive (adaptive feedback) control algorithms are not suitable for broadband networks [HS91], [Kle92], <ref> [YM92] </ref>. Such mechanisms are performance limited by the round trip delay of the feedback information, which does not match the temporal constraints of broadband services. Moreover, large amounts of buffer space are required in nodes to minimize the risk of buffer overflow.

Reference-contexts: Even then, this method may not be practically feasible due to technological difficulties in getting the appropriate electronics to run at such a very high speed. Also, extra difficulties related to proper line coding/decoding at very high speeds further complicates this solution <ref> [YNY86] </ref>. On the other hand, though this technique is more complex than other synchronization methods, it nevertheless has the advantage of the jitter being easily compensated for. Also, it is quite resistant to failures.

Reference-contexts: This is mainly due to their slow responsiveness when compared with the pace of events occurring in such a network. Furthermore, several new strategies for congestion control recently proposed for high-speed networks, such as Virtual Clock <ref> [Zha90] </ref>, Delay Earliest Due Date (Delay-EDD) [FV90], Jitter Earliest Due Date (Jitter-EDD) [VZF91] and Dynamic Time Windows [MLF92], are not very advantageous either.

Reference-contexts: Exact expressions for the moment generating functions of the queue size and, accordingly, for the delays W DAOS niso,k and W ID niso,k , can be derived in this case. The queueing analysis of such a system is, however, a difficult task [VV90], <ref> [Zha91] </ref>. This analysis is further complicated by the fact that our model is a general one, i.e., of type multiple-station-multiple-server [MDeM+92].

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, to compensate for the increased ratio of propagation delay to cell/packet transmission time, some form of structural and/or functional parallelism (or pipelining) must be used in processing the different protocols and/or data structures involved in a communication process <ref> [Zit91] </ref>, [GNI92], [Kle92], [ITN93]. 1.3 Solution Approach The fundamental shift in technologies and their tradeoff forces us to consider new alternative approaches to the integrated multi-Gbit/s communication over multiwavelength optical networks. <p> Three levels of parallelism are generally identified for a communication process, which are given by the degree of granularity (i.e., coarse grain, medium grain and fine grain) used when introducing parallelism into protocol processing [JSB90], [Haa91], <ref> [Zit91] </ref>, [GNI92]. 26 Typically, coarse grain processing involves high-level functions or tasks assigned to individual processors such as, for instance, in the case of connection-dedicated-to-processor approach.

Reference-contexts: Also, these mechanisms are complex and difficult to implement <ref> [ZK91] </ref>. We believe, in contrast, that solutions where the service controller is based solely on the aggregate traffic of each class (so-called rate-based servers) are more advantageous, due to their simplicity and the choice to open up the processing bottleneck. <p> The main drawback connected with the framing strategy takes different forms in the case of Stop-and-Go and DTS mechanisms. In order to provide performance guarantees, as specified in the contracted QoS, a rate-based service discipline must accept nonwork conserving <ref> [ZK91] </ref>. This means that it might happen that the network/node server is idle, though there are packets waiting for service (at the network edges or inside the nodes), but that are not yet admitted for service. The Stop-and-Go mechanism is typical for such kind of problems [Gol91a], [Gol91b].
