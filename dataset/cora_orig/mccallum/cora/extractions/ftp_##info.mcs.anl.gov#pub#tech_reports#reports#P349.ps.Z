Reference-contexts: For example, in the analysis of augmented La-grangian algorithms, A is the Hessian of the Lagrangian and C is a positive semidefinite matrix associated with the active constraint normals. The proof of Theorem 2.2 when C is semidefinite is short and elementary; see, for example, Bertsekas <ref> [1, Lemma 1.25] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The initial application of algorithms for the solution of (1.1) was to trust region methods for unconstrained minimization. See, for example, Gay [6] and More and Sorensen [15]. Recent application to other problems includes that by Coleman and Hempel <ref> [2] </ref> on constrained optimization, Ye [20] on quadratic programming, Pardalos, Ye, and Han [16] on quadratic knapsack problems, and Karmarkar, Resende, and Ramakrishnan [12] on covering problems. Several extensions of the basic problem (1.1) are of interest.

Reference-contexts: Gander [4] considered this problem as a special case of the problem with the equality constraint c (x) = 0, and characterized the solution in terms of the Lagrange multiplier. For recent work on this problem, see the work of Golub and von Matt [7].

Reference-contexts: For example, the problem where min fkAx bk 2 : kCx dk 2 ffg ; (1:4) arises in the regularization of ill-posed problems and in the smoothing of noisy data. Note that this problem is a special case of (1.3) with both q and c convex.

Reference-contexts: An interesting and surprising aspect of this problem is that it is possible to obtain a characterization of the global minimizer. This result, due to Gay <ref> [5] </ref> and Sorensen [17], is that x fl is a global minimizer if and only if kDx fl k , the Kuhn-Tucker condition rq (x fl ) + fl D T Dx fl = 0 is satisfied, and the Hessian of the Lagrangian r 2 q (x fl ) + fl <p> The surprising aspect of this result is that it holds for any quadratic q; there is no assumption of convexity. Gay <ref> [5] </ref> and Sorensen [17] used this characterization result to develop an algorithm for the solution of (1.1) that paid special attention to the case where the Hessian of the Lagrangian (1.2) is nearly singular. <p> I PD , then A + 0 C is not positive definite, and thus we can compute an x 2 IR n such that x T (A + 0 C)x 0; x 6= 0: (5:4) A vector x that satisfies (5.4) can be computed, as in the algorithms of Gay <ref> [5] </ref> and More and Sorensen [15], by noting that during the Cholesky decomposition of A + 0 C it is possible to find ffi 0 such that the leading submatrix of order l n of A + 0 C + ffie l e T l is singular, and x 2 IR <p> If C is positive (negative) semidefinite, it is not difficult to show that OE is convex (concave) on I PD , and thus a safeguarded version of Newton's method is a reasonable choice. This is the approach used by Gay <ref> [5] </ref> and More and Sorensen [15]. If C is indefinite, then OE may not be convex or concave, so extra care is needed.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 2.2 If A 2 IR nfin and C 2 IR nfin are symmetric matrices, then A+C is positive definite for some 2 IR if and only if (2.2) holds. Theorem 2.2 is a classical result on quadratic forms. Hestenes <ref> [10, Theorem 6.1] </ref> gives an elementary, but somewhat lengthy proof of Theorem 2.2. We will give another proof of this result in Section 3. Uhlig [19] is an excellent source for additional information on results related to Theorem 2.2. Theorem 2.2 arises in several areas.

Reference-contexts: This result can be established by first recalling the classical 12 result that since I PD is not empty, there is a nonsingular similarity transformation that diagonalizes A and C. For a proof of this result, see Horn and Johnson <ref> [11, Theorem 7.6.1] </ref>. Thus, there is a nonsingular P 2 IR nfin such that P T AP = D a ; P T CP = D c ; where both D a and D c are diagonal matrices.

Reference-contexts: Since f ff g is bounded, a subsequence converges to some 2 IR, and since A ff + ff C is positive definite, A + C is positive semidefinite. ffi This result was established by Krein and Smuljan <ref> [13] </ref> for Hilbert spaces over the complex field by an entirely different argument. Note that our proof is valid for real vector spaces. The assumption that C is indefinite is necessary in Theorem 2.3.

For example, if A = 1 0 ! 0 1 ; b = 1 ! then I PD = (1; 1), but OE 00 changes sign in (1; 1). <p> The situation where A + fl C is singular is more delicate. In this case OE () = 0 may not have a solution in I PD , and fx ( k )g may not converge to the solution of (3.1); this is the reason why More and Sorensen <ref> [15] </ref>, in their study of the problem with C = I, called this case the hard case. Theorem 5.3 Let A and C be symmetric matrices, and assume that I PD is not empty. <p> Thus, if there is an ff 2 IR such that c [x () + ff z ] = 0, then the termination criteria (6.1) are satisfied for any * c &gt; 0. The theorems of this section extend results of More and Sorensen <ref> [15] </ref> to the case where the quadratic function c is arbitrary. <p> Since OE is either constant or strictly decreasing, we can update the interval ( l ; u ) of Section 5 and isolate the appropriate solution. Our treatments of the algorithm also differ. Stern and Wolkowicz [18] follow the development of More and Sorensen <ref> [15] </ref> and outline an algorithm that exploits the Cholesky factorization of A + C, while our treatment in Sections 5 and 6 is independent of the method used to determine the solution x () of the linear system (5.2).

Reference-contexts: 6.1 is a generalization of Lemma 3.13. 18 7 Concluding Remarks During the final stages of the preparation of this manuscript I attended the Panamerican Workshop on Applied and Computational Mathematics (Universidad Simon Bolivar, Cara-cas, January 10-15, 1993), where Henry Wolkowicz gave me a copy of his recently completed manuscript <ref> [18] </ref> with Ronald Stern on the problem minfq (x) : c l x T Cx c u g; (7:1) and on the application of this problem to nonsymmetric eigenvalue perturbations. Although the two manuscripts are related, there are several differences in our approach and results. <p> If we consider the one-sided case of (7.1), then it is clear that (7.1) is a special case of (1.3); however, note that if r 2 c = C is nonsingular, then a change of variables transforms (1.3) into (7.1). The characterization result in <ref> [18] </ref> assumes that rc (x fl ) 6= 0, or that c l &lt; 0 &lt; c u . As pointed out in Section 3, this assumption is stronger than (3.2) for the equality constrained case where c l = c u . <p> As pointed out in Section 3, this assumption is stronger than (3.2) for the equality constrained case where c l = c u . Note, in particular, that if C is indefinite, then (3.2) is automatically satisfied, but that this is not the case for the assumptions in <ref> [18] </ref>. Similar remarks apply to the inequality constrained case where c l = 1. The introduction of the two-sided bounds in (7.1) is an interesting variation. <p> Since OE is either constant or strictly decreasing, we can update the interval ( l ; u ) of Section 5 and isolate the appropriate solution. Our treatments of the algorithm also differ. Stern and Wolkowicz <ref> [18] </ref> follow the development of More and Sorensen [15] and outline an algorithm that exploits the Cholesky factorization of A + C, while our treatment in Sections 5 and 6 is independent of the method used to determine the solution x () of the linear system (5.2).
