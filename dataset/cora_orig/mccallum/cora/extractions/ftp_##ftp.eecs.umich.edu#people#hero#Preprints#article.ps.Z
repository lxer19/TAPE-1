Title: Highlights of Statistical Signal and Array Processing  1 Background and Overview (section written by  
Author: Alfred Hero) 
Date: June 29, 1998  
Abstract: Many engineering applications require extraction of a signal or parameter of interest from degraded measurements. To accomplish this it is often useful to deploy fine grained statistical models; diverse sensors which acquire extra spatial, temporal, or polarization information; or multidimensional signal representations, e.g. time-frequency or time scale. When applied in combination these approaches can be used to develop highly sensitive signal estimation, detection, or tracking algorithms which can exploit small but persistent differences between signals, interferences, and noise. Conversely, these approaches can be used to develop algorithms to identify a channel or system producing a signal in additive noise and interference, even when the channel input is unknown but has known statistical properties. Broadly stated, the Statistical Signal and Array Processing (SSAP) area is concerned with reliable estimation, detection and classification of signals which are subject to random fluctuations. Opening a recent issue of the IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing to a SSAP paper the reader will probably see one or more of the following: (1) description of a mathematical and statistical model for measured data, including models for sensor, signal, and noise; (2) careful statistical analysis of the fundamental limitations of the data including deriving benchmarks on performance, e.g. the Cramer-Rao, Ziv-Zakai, Barankin, Rate Distortion, Chernov, or other lower bounds on average estimator/detector error; (3) development of mathematically optimal or suboptimal estimation/detection algorithms; (4) asymptotic analysis of error performance establishing that the proposed algorithm comes close to reaching a benchmark derived in (2); (5) simulations or experiments which compare algorithm performance to the lower bound and to other competing algorithms. Depending on the specific application, a SSAP algorithm may also have to be adaptive to changing signal and noise environments, This requires incorporating flexible statistical models, implementing low-complexity real-time estimation and filtering algorithms, and on-line performance monitoring. Until recently the statistical signal and array processing area was covered by the SSAP Technical Committee which grew out of the Spectrum Estimation and Modeling Technical Committee (discontinued in 1991). At ICASSP-98 in Seattle, an administrative restructuring took place which eliminated the SSAP, Digital Signal Processing (DSP), and Underwater Acoustics Signal Processing (UASP) Technical Committees, replacing them by three new committees: Signal Processing The

Reference-contexts: Using the parsimony-achieving potential of wavelets, other well adapted analyses were proposed [84] for identification/synthesis of turbulent velocity signals. In particular, these were shown to provide a considerable simplification and usefulness for turbulence signals. Other applications where fractal signals have shown promise include biomedical, biochemistry <ref> [1] </ref> and communications [461]. Other multiscale analyses of related processes, such as nonstationary processes with stationary increments [49, 212] 2 have resulted in stationarizing properties, thus allowing the application of classical statistical techniques and equally important a deeper understanding of other nonstationary parametric processes [212].

Reference-contexts: Some of these input properties can be imposed by the transmitter design (e.g., periodically inserted guard times or constant modulus [143], [416], <ref> [3] </ref>) and from this point of view blind schemes can be thought of as semi-blind identification approaches because the input may be unknown to the receiver but its characteristics which can be imposed at the transmitter are known a distinct difference with time series modeling applications where the input is inaccessible

Reference-contexts: A signal processing application of the Metropolis algorithm is parameter estimation of damped sinusoids [16].

MCMC methods have been successfully applied to the selection of model order of a time series [15], [22], [145], [417]. In some of these papers nonstandard assumptions were made, which make the direct estimation problem quite intractable.

Reference-contexts: In both distributions, the kernel is characterized by one parameter whose value may be adjusted to achieve a tradeoff between resolution and cross term suppression. A fully signal-dependent kernel, was proposed by Baraniuk and Jones <ref> [12] </ref>, where the kernel self-adapts its shape based on the underlying signal characteristics. In this respect, unlike both the CW and the ZAM TFDs, the signal dependent TFD is a nonlinear smoothing of the WD.

Reference-contexts: Time-frequency distributions have recently found applications to radar and sensor array processing. To mention a couple, Barabarossa and Farina <ref> [13] </ref> have combined conventional space time processing with TFDs and demonstrate the advantage of the joint processing for clatter suppression and target detection.

Reference-contexts: The self-similarity naturally leads to wavelet-based analysis, see e.g., [2]. Semi-parametric techniques, based on log-periodogram regression, are proposed for estimating the fractal dimension in [277], and fractal point process models have been proposed in <ref> [14, 219, 344] </ref>, but several interesting analysis and synthesis problems remain open. 9.4 Multiplicative noise Just as non-linearities give rise to non-Gaussianity, they also lead to non-additive noise.

The theory has been extended to arbitrarily-sampled spatial data [46, 243] but, for irregularly sampled time series, interpolation may be a viable alternative [409, 410].

This led to modeling algorithms with high efficiency as a result of the tree-like structure of the analysis. The generality of this modeling technique comes from the fact that the nodes may be interpreted differently depending on the application [249], and the appeal of easily implementable algorithms.

Reference-contexts: In the operational stage, receivers usually switch to Submitted to IEEE SP Magazine, June 1998 29 a decision-feedback mode where previously equalized and quantized (according to the alphabet) symbols are used together with the received data to update channel estimates [321], <ref> [24] </ref>, [323]. Training sequences consume bandwidth and consumption increases if frequent re-training is required to avoid erroneous convergence of decision feedback equalizers (DFEs) which occurs when the propagation channel is time-varying; see e.g., [326], [90]. <p> SOS are sample correlations and power spectral densities of the received (symbol-rate sampled) stationary data, whereas HOS refers to e.g., sample fourth-order cumulants and polyspectral densities which can extract additional information from the non-Gaussian data about the underlying channel [233]. They are useful for mitigation of nonlinear effects <ref> [24] </ref>, and blind estimation of LTI channels because they complement channel magnitude response information (conveyed by SOS) with complete phase response information which allows equalization of nonminimum phase channels [430], [131], [370], and [157]. <p> Given a channel estimate, the latter is implemented using Viterbi's algorithm <ref> [24] </ref>, and is the optimum means of recovering the finite-alphabet input, although its practical use is limited due to its complexity which especially with multiuser communications increases exponentially in the channel order and the number of users [442].

Reference-contexts: Especially for code-division multiple access (CDMA) systems entailing asynchronous users, correct timing acquisition affects performance considerably, and a variety of methods (including subspace approaches) have been proposed recently (see e.g., [383], <ref> [25] </ref>). Blind equalizers of FIR frequency-selective channels do not need to acquire timing because they absorb it in the channel itself. In addition, methods that rely on the constant-modulus (restoral) algorithm (CMA) do not require frequency offset estimation [143], [416]. <p> Such self-recovering CDMA receivers were proposed recently in [420], [474], [383], [241], <ref> [25] </ref>, and [419]. They capitalize on code diversity offered by the user code (s) and the received data but have relatively high complexity especially because they adopt subspace decomposition (via the SVD) of large matrices for signature waveform estimation.

Reference-contexts: thus utilize bandwidth efficiently, self-recovering (a.k.a. blind) algorithms have received attention over the last dozen years for identifying the channel or estimating the equalizer directly using output data only a feature also important when information transmission cannot be interrupted for training as for example in broadcasting and multicasting scenaria [143], <ref> [26] </ref>, [117]. The success of blind methods in a communications context depends on maximum exploitation of input features such as whiteness, non-Gaussianity, finite alphabet, constant modulus, cyclostationarity properties that equalizers are often designed to restore at their outputs by optimizing pertinent criteria.

Reference-contexts: The use of acoustic vector sensors for array processing has been proposed in [285] and [286]. These references introduced measurement models, derived fast direction estimation algorithms, and presented general Cramer-Rao bounds on direction parameters. These developments have coincided with a surge of interest in particle velocity sensors <ref> [27] </ref> and improvements in fabrication techniques [97] to make vector-sensor arrays a practical reality [290]. Since a vector sensor extracts directional information directly from the structure of the velocity field, it can, for example, locate up to two sources in 3D space [175].

Reference-contexts: The Bayesian approach to making the required inference relies on the use of probability models for the observed data and the application of probability theory, where a key role is played by Bayes' theorem <ref> [28] </ref>, [41], [123], [198], [339], [355], [379]. The inference is made in terms of probability statements, and the methodology, overall, is coherent and on conceptually sound and indisputable grounds. <p> The controversy seems to have subsided lately, partially due to improved interpretations of the priors in many applications and also to the maturation of the theory of Bayes methods which has greatly clarified the impact of mismatched priors on the final results <ref> [28] </ref>, [41]. 3.2 Basics To put things in prospective, consider first a problem where estimation is required. Let the observed data be denoted by y and the set of unknown parameters that have to be estimated by . <p> In most cases of interest, however, such sampling is impossible. A more practical method is to generate samples from simpler distributions followed by approximation of the integrals by sample averages. One of these methods is importance sampling <ref> [28] </ref>, [123], [297]. The generating distributions are called importance sampling functions, and their choice is crucial because the variance of the estimated integrals is critically dependent on them. A related procedure is sampling-importance resampling, which generates samples from the posterior distribution by repeated sampling from simpler distributions [342]. <p> Submitted to IEEE SP Magazine, June 1998 11 Another approach is to use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods <ref> [28] </ref>, [123], [137], [297], [392]. These methods have extended the Bayesian methodology to many previously intractable applications. The key idea is to generate samples by running an ergodic Markov chain whose distribution after convergence is the desired posterior distribution.

Reference-contexts: The noises v (k) and g (k) are now, in general, correlated, non-Gaussian, and have non-zero means. Multiplicative noise is encountered in speckle imagery [40], fading channels [141, 324], underwater acoustics [99], lidar and radar <ref> [29] </ref>. An interesting approach is taken in [318], where the signal is a harmonic, the noises are modeled as being non-random, and error bounds on the frequency estimates are developed.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the min-max CFAR optimal detector can be viewed from the point of view of Bayesian detection implemented with a least favorable prior on the unknown noise density.

In many cases direct min-max optimization is difficult and simpler suboptimal CFAR alternatives are of interest.

Multiplicative noise is encountered in speckle imagery <ref> [40] </ref>, fading channels [141, 324], underwater acoustics [99], lidar and radar [29]. An interesting approach is taken in [318], where the signal is a harmonic, the noises are modeled as being non-random, and error bounds on the frequency estimates are developed.

Reference-contexts: The Bayesian approach to making the required inference relies on the use of probability models for the observed data and the application of probability theory, where a key role is played by Bayes' theorem [28], <ref> [41] </ref>, [123], [198], [339], [355], [379]. The inference is made in terms of probability statements, and the methodology, overall, is coherent and on conceptually sound and indisputable grounds. <p> The controversy seems to have subsided lately, partially due to improved interpretations of the priors in many applications and also to the maturation of the theory of Bayes methods which has greatly clarified the impact of mismatched priors on the final results [28], <ref> [41] </ref>. 3.2 Basics To put things in prospective, consider first a problem where estimation is required.

Reference-contexts: From a historical Submitted to IEEE SP Magazine, June 1998 3 perspective, time delay estimation and spectral estimation are two of the oldest areas of statistical signal processing dating back at least to the late nineteenth century (see <ref> [42] </ref>), yet they remain two of the most active areas today. Continuing along these lines are sections on the increasingly important problems of detection and estimation in the time-frequency domain, written by Moeness Amin, and the time-scale or multiresolution domain, written by Hamid Krim and Jean-Christophe Pesquet.

Reference-contexts: it has been of some interest to investigate the nature of the given signal: whether it is a Gaussian process and if it is non-Gaussian, whether it is a linear process. 10.2.1 Gaussianity tests Several tests have been devised on the basis of the fact that the higher-order cumulant spectra <ref> [43] </ref> of Gaussian processes vanish. One of the earliest tests based upon testing of the signal bispectrum is given in [329].

Reference-contexts: Experimental measurements show that ambient noise is often significantly non-Gaussian, particularly in urban and radio channels [270] and underwater acoustic channels <ref> [45, 269] </ref>. In communication channels, multiple user interference is highly structured and non-Gaussian. Of course, non-linearities usually lead to non-Gaussian outputs. In general, the multivariate pdfs of non-Gaussian processes are intractable, and with few excep Submitted to IEEE SP Magazine, June 1998 34 tions there are no general models.

Turning to non-stationary processes, multitaper spectrograms have been in use since shortly after the invention of multitaper estimates, see [401, 224, 191, 336, 312, 164]. Multitaper wavelets [85, 234, 80] have also been used.

Reference-contexts: In particular, these were shown to provide a considerable simplification and usefulness for turbulence signals.

The latter extension often brings the BSS problem close to the problem of channel equalization and of system identification (see the sections by Giannkis and Tugnait in this article). Another interesting extension is to consider the case where the BSS model does not hold. <p> For example, source signals in communications often can only have a finite number of alphabets, which enable the separation of multiple sources. The statistical independency among sources is another condition that leads to a number of effective source separation algorithms <ref> [50] </ref>, among them is the widely applied constant modulus algorithm (CMA) [143, 416]. In a special issue of IEEE Proceedings [242] to appear later this year, tutorials of blind source separation techniques and their applications are presented.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, grouped coordinate updating techniques like ECME, SAGE and AECM may not converge even when the likelihood is convex but is non-differentiable. In these cases it is still possible to improve on the plain vanilla EM algorithm. Two recent advances are the method of Lavielle <ref> [225, 51] </ref> and the method of Chretien and Hero [63, 64]. The former allows implementation of the E step via stochastic approximation (or simulated annealing [226]) when a closed form for the E step is not available.

Reference-contexts: Optimal filtering is another area of major activity in signal processing. When the signal model is non-linear or the signal is non-Gaussian the Kalman or extended Kalman filters can give very poor performance. A powerful alternative is to use Bayesian filters based on sequential importance or Gibbs samplings <ref> [52] </ref>, [146], [391]. A signal processing application of the Metropolis algorithm is parameter estimation of damped sinusoids [16]. When joint detection of sinusoids and the estimation of their parameters are of interest, the reversible jump MCMC has been successfully applied [7], [91].

Reference-contexts: MCMC methods have been successfully applied to the selection of model order of a time series [15], [22], [145], [417].

Analysis of mixed spectra within a hierarchical Bayesian framework was proposed in <ref> [53] </ref> via an MCMC algorithm. MCMC methods have also been very useful in enhancing speech and music signals, which are degraded by non-Gaussian noise characterized by impulses superimposed on a Gaussian background [144].

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, there is no single measurement procedure appropriate for all TDE scenarios.

Reference-contexts: Also, for velocity measurements (e.g., bio-medical <ref> [55] </ref>, pp. 469-476, or nuclear engineering applications [55] pp. 363-366), r is assumed known, and t, the time required for a signal to travel the distance, r, is measured.

TDE is also important for more complicated, non-linear problems such as source direction of arrival (DOA) or bearing measurement. <p> If (assuming free space propagation conditions) the signal due to a source is received by two sensors separated by distance l, then the differential delay between the signal received by the sensors is given by t = lsin v , where is the source DOA <ref> [55] </ref> pp. 403-409. <p> Unfortunately, there is no single measurement procedure appropriate for all TDE scenarios. This fact, combined with the practical importance of measuring time delay in so many different applications, is why time delay estimation has received so much attention over the last three decades e.g., <ref> [55] </ref>, [54]. 4.1 Basic TDE The most general TDE problem is now formulated. <p> Depending on the application, different modeling assumptions are made on the signal waveform, s (t), the noise waveforms, n 1 (t) and n 2 (t), and the parameters, t and ff. It is convenient to distinguish between the cases of so-called "active" and "passive" TDE <ref> [55] </ref> pp. 442-448. * In active TDE, where x 1 (t) and x 2 (t) correspond to the transmitted and received signals respectively, it is appropriate to assume that n 1 (t) = 0 and that s (t) is a known, deterministic signal. <p> This well known "nominal passive scenario" was addressed and "solved" some 20 years ago. In particular, it was shown that the Submitted to IEEE SP Magazine, June 1998 14 (asymptotically optimum) ML processor for this scenario is the generalized cross-correlator (GCC) <ref> [55] </ref> pp. 138-144. As shown in Fig. 1, the GCC cross-correlates appropriately pre-filtered versions of the sensor outputs, forming c t as the time corresponding to the maximum GCC output. Moreover, the GCC has been shown to be optimum even in non-asymptotic conditions [55] pp. 126-129. and n 1 (t) = <p> this scenario is the generalized cross-correlator (GCC) <ref> [55] </ref> pp. 138-144. As shown in Fig. 1, the GCC cross-correlates appropriately pre-filtered versions of the sensor outputs, forming c t as the time corresponding to the maximum GCC output. Moreover, the GCC has been shown to be optimum even in non-asymptotic conditions [55] pp. 126-129. and n 1 (t) = 0), the matched filter is obtained by setting H 1 (!) = H 2 (!) = 1. Intuitively, an estimator for t in (1) should to seek the best "match" between x 2 (t) and a delayed version of x 1 (t). <p> Much Submitted to IEEE SP Magazine, June 1998 15 research has been directed toward adaptive TDE, tracking, and the development of parametric techniques for simultaneously estimating delay and Doppler shift e.g., <ref> [55] </ref>, Part 4. * The implementation of the GCC requires prior knowledge of the power spectra of the source signal and the noise processes. It is well known that the asymptotic delay estimation error does not increase if the spectra are unknown. <p> The adaptation of classical TDE techniques to modern, software based realizations raises both practical and theoretical problems. In particular, interpolation of the discrete delay estimate <ref> [55] </ref> pp. 343-350 and the effect of sampling on the achievable TOA error [18] have both been studied. Perhaps the most important deviation from the nominal scenarios is that of non-Gaussian statistical scenarios. <p> In cases where the signal, s (t), is non-Gaussian while the additive noise processes are Gaussian (and possibly correlated), high order statistical (HOS) techniques have been proposed for TDE <ref> [55] </ref> pp.168-171, [166], [427].

Reference-contexts: Recent attempts focus on inducing cyclostationarity or diversity at the transmitter by means of periodic modulating sequences or redundant filterbank precoders [424], [128], <ref> [60] </ref>, [368], [353]. Equalization exploiting transmit-diversity is very promising because contrary to FSEs, it imposes no channel disparity conditions, is applicable to non-white and deterministic inputs, and shows robustness to channel order overestimation, and additive stationary colored noise [424], [368].

Reference-contexts: Finally, the min-max CFAR optimal detector can be viewed from the point of view of Bayesian detection implemented with a least favorable prior on the unknown noise density. Thus in principle the Bayesian methods developed in [119], [30], and more recently in <ref> [61] </ref>, can be manipulated to provide CFAR tests. In many cases direct min-max optimization is difficult and simpler suboptimal CFAR alternatives are of interest. The conceptually simplest approach is the GLR "estimate and plug" procedure which requires computing maximum likelihood estimates for the unknown noise parameters.

Reference-contexts: In such a case, and also for low SNR environment, the signal auto-terms may not be identifiable using WD which renders signal classifications and synthesis difficult and sometimes impossible. Choi and Williams <ref> [62] </ref> and Zhao, Atlas and Marks [466] have proposed t-f kernels, which make such identification much more feasible than attainable using the WD. The distributions corresponding to these two kernels have come to be known as the Choi-Williams and the ZAM TFDs. <p> The receding of the noise fluctuations brings about a clear manifestation of the signal signature in the time-frequency domain. Step-by-step design for kernels leading to reduce interference distributions (RID)was given by Jeong and Williams [183]. Indeed, the above two influential papers <ref> [62] </ref> [183] on the reduction of cross-terms through low-pass filtering in the ambiguity domain have made the technical community more attentive to the flexibility and generalization underlying Cohen's class of TFDs and has set the stage for a surge of activities in this area in the last decade.

Reference-contexts: In these cases it is still possible to improve on the plain vanilla EM algorithm. Two recent advances are the method of Lavielle [225, 51] and the method of Chretien and Hero <ref> [63, 64] </ref>. The former allows implementation of the E step via stochastic approximation (or simulated annealing [226]) when a closed form for the E step is not available. <p> Furthermore, under appropriate conditions on the anealing schedule, this method guarantees (w.p.1) convergence to the global maximum for any intialization. On the other hand, the determinstic method of Chretien and Hero <ref> [63] </ref> was developed for non-differentiable non-convex likelihood functions and iteratively approximates the ML estimate via cutting plane methods, specifically proximal point iterations with Kullback-Liebler penalty. When the relaxation parameter in the proximal point algorithm is equal to one this method reduces to the standard EM algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Some high-resolution direction finding algorithms have been developed for EM vector-sensor arrays [230], [173], [171], [457], [458]. Preliminary results on the application of vector sensors to communication problems can be found in [471] and <ref> [65] </ref>. 11.3 Acoustic Vector Sensors Acoustic vector sensors measure the acoustic pressure and all 3 components of the acoustic particle velocity vector at a given point; standard methods measure only the pressure. The use of acoustic vector sensors for array processing has been proposed in [285] and [286].

Reference-contexts: At the expense of added complexity and possibility of divergence, DFEs offer a practical alternative to equalizing channels with unit-circle zeros and their asymptotic performance has been shown recently to approach that of the maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) [323], <ref> [66] </ref>. Given a channel estimate, the latter is implemented using Viterbi's algorithm [24], and is the optimum means of recovering the finite-alphabet input, although its practical use is limited due to its complexity which especially with multiuser communications increases exponentially in the channel order and the number of users [442].

Reference-contexts: Both Wigner distribution (also known as Wigner-Ville distribution) and the spectrogram are prominent members of Cohen's class. Extensive investigation of the desirable properties of a distribution and associated kernel requirements was done by Claasen and Mecklenbrauker <ref> [67] </ref>. Their three part paper published in 1980 drew much attention to the limitations and offerings of Wigner distribution and marked the first comprehensive treatment of the subject using familiar continuous and discrete signal analysis methods.

Reference-contexts: When the GLR is intractable, e.g. for non-Gaussian signals, and the noise covariance is known up to a scale factor, CFAR tests have been proposed based on maximizing alternative criteria such as: deflection or contrast [102, 310]; circular correlation coefficient for sinusoid detection [300]; and coherence [125] and generalized coherence <ref> [68] </ref> for multi-channel signal detection. CFAR detectors have also been derived based on summary statistics such as: order statistical filter outputs [453], higher order spectra [209, 167]; matched filter multiple-correlation lag products [134]; weighted sub-space fitting residuals [445]; and adaptive filtering followed by subspace projections [228].

Reference-contexts: Sixteen years after Wigner had introduced his distribution, Cohen <ref> [69] </ref> provided a consistent set of definitions for a desirable class of time-frequency distributions (TFDs), often referred as Cohen's class. This class has been of great value in guiding efforts in this area of research.

Reference-contexts: Other important contributions that have given a timely overall "big picture' view of the state of this dynamically changing and rapidly growing area in signal processing are the review articles by Cohen <ref> [70] </ref> , Boashash [32], and Hlawatsch and Boudreaux-Bartels [170]. In some respects, these articles have elaborated on a single channel deterministic aspect of TFDs and did not fully address the problem from statistical signal processing perspective.

Reference-contexts: Further, TFDs have been successfully applied to areas where signals are localizable in the time frequency domain and have fixed distinct signatures that permit their classification and separation. Many of these applications are discussed in the book by Cohen <ref> [71] </ref> and also in the book by Qian and Chen [325]. The paper by Boudreaux-Bartels and Parks [37] was the first to recognize that by devising a method to synthesize the signal from the time-frequency domain, the WD may be cast as a tool for signal enhancement and noise suppression.

Reference-contexts: BSS is an `output-only' technique in the sense that neither source signals nor training sequences are available: all of the available information is contained in the observed data themselves. Two seminal papers on this topic are those by Jutten et al. [188] and Comon <ref> [74] </ref>. The major strength of the blind approach to source separation stems precisely from the fact that a precise model of the underlying physical phenomena, e.g., wave generation, propagation, and transduction, is not required.

Reference-contexts: Such analysis led to significant advances in fully and accurately identifying fractal and multifractal signals [179], and in other related synthesis problems of fractional Brownian motion [114, 461, 395, 257].

In particular, these were shown to provide a considerable simplification and usefulness for turbulence signals. Other applications where fractal signals have shown promise include biomedical, biochemistry [1] and communications [461].

Reference-contexts: Training sequences consume bandwidth and consumption increases if frequent re-training is required to avoid erroneous convergence of decision feedback equalizers (DFEs) which occurs when the propagation channel is time-varying; see e.g., [326], <ref> [90] </ref>. <p> Blind approaches show more promise in future wireless and mobile communications, high-frequency modems, digital audio and video broadcasting systems where rapid channel variations render the overhead for training prohibitive; see e.g., [117], [103], and <ref> [90] </ref>. Although receiver-based (or post-) equalization has been predominantly treated, when a reverse link is available from the receiver, transmitter-based (or pre-)equalization is also possible when channel estimates are available as shown by [411] and [154]; see also [121] for recent advances in pre-equalization and its relationship with DFEs. <p> In addition, methods that rely on the constant-modulus (restoral) algorithm (CMA) do not require frequency offset estimation [143], [416].

Reference-contexts: A signal processing application of the Metropolis algorithm is parameter estimation of damped sinusoids [16]. When joint detection of sinusoids and the estimation of their parameters are of interest, the reversible jump MCMC has been successfully applied [7], <ref> [91] </ref>. MCMC methods have been successfully applied to the selection of model order of a time series [15], [22], [145], [417]. In some of these papers nonstandard assumptions were made, which make the direct estimation problem quite intractable.

Multidimensional integration is also necessary when some of the signal parameters are not of interest.

Reference-contexts: It was shown that the estimates of all the unknowns in this problem can be obtained straightforwardly by Gibbs sampling [58]. In a different setting, blind deconvolution of Bernoulli-Gaussian processes was implemented by an MCMC approach in <ref> [96] </ref>. Optimal filtering is another area of major activity in signal processing. When the signal model is non-linear or the signal is non-Gaussian the Kalman or extended Kalman filters can give very poor performance.

Reference-contexts: The noises v (k) and g (k) are now, in general, correlated, non-Gaussian, and have non-zero means.

An interesting approach is taken in [318], where the signal is a harmonic, the noises are modeled as being non-random, and error bounds on the frequency estimates are developed. <p> In the case of a harmonic signal, and stationary noises, conventional spectral analysis of the data ("cyclic mean") or of the squared data ("cyclic variance") have been proposed and analyzed in [468]; fourth-order cumulants were used in <ref> [99] </ref>. Cramer-Rao bounds were established in [118, 467, 385]. Some parameter estimation problems are discussed in [384]. Note that all these papers assume that the additive and multiplicative noises are independent.

Reference-contexts: One of the first signal processing applications of EM after DLR appeared was to the problem of emission tomography [372] and shortly thereafter to transmission tomography [221]. Many follow-up papers appeared on this topic in the medical imaging community (see e.g. <ref> [110] </ref> for a partial list) before the EM algorithm was applied to other signal processing problems such as parameter estimation for multiple superimposed signals [106, 107] and direction finding [271]. Wide adoption of the EM algorithm was hindered by its disappointingly slow convergence speed. <p> However, there is a tradeoff between speed of convergence and implementation complexity: the M step of the standard EM algorithm usually becomes more difficult as X becomes less informative. It was discovered by Fessler and Hero <ref> [110] </ref> that this tradeoff can be eased by reformulation of the EM algorithm with "hidden data" sets which are less informative than complete data sets and which can vary at each iteration. <p> Interestingly, for the case of the superimposed signals problem PX-EM reduces to SAGE.

Reference-contexts: The Bayesian approach to making the required inference relies on the use of probability models for the observed data and the application of probability theory, where a key role is played by Bayes' theorem [28], [41], <ref> [123] </ref>, [198], [339], [355], [379]. The inference is made in terms of probability statements, and the methodology, overall, is coherent and on conceptually sound and indisputable grounds. <p> In most cases of interest, however, such sampling is impossible. A more practical method is to generate samples from simpler distributions followed by approximation of the integrals by sample averages. One of these methods is importance sampling [28], <ref> [123] </ref>, [297]. The generating distributions are called importance sampling functions, and their choice is crucial because the variance of the estimated integrals is critically dependent on them. A related procedure is sampling-importance resampling, which generates samples from the posterior distribution by repeated sampling from simpler distributions [342]. <p> Submitted to IEEE SP Magazine, June 1998 11 Another approach is to use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods [28], <ref> [123] </ref>, [137], [297], [392]. These methods have extended the Bayesian methodology to many previously intractable applications. The key idea is to generate samples by running an ergodic Markov chain whose distribution after convergence is the desired posterior distribution.

The Gibbs sampler has been widely and succesfully applied to problems in image processing where the number of unknowns is very large <ref> [124] </ref>.

The new method, called the reversible jump MCMC sampler jumps from one parameter space to another based on transition probabilities of another Markov chain.

Reference-contexts: When the GLR is intractable, e.g. for non-Gaussian signals, and the noise covariance is known up to a scale factor, CFAR tests have been proposed based on maximizing alternative criteria such as: deflection or contrast [102, 310]; circular correlation coefficient for sinusoid detection [300]; and coherence <ref> [125] </ref> and generalized coherence [68] for multi-channel signal detection. CFAR detectors have also been derived based on summary statistics such as: order statistical filter outputs [453], higher order spectra [209, 167]; matched filter multiple-correlation lag products [134]; weighted sub-space fitting residuals [445]; and adaptive filtering followed by subspace projections [228].

Reference-contexts: The challenging task of estimating channel parameters using training data or decision-feedback has been addressed in [425]. Blind approaches for random coefficient fading channels are yet to be developed. However, blind methods adopting deterministic finitely parameterized LTV models have been proposed recently using a basis expansion [421], <ref> [133] </ref>. They turn LTV-SISO models to LTI-MIMO structures with inputs formed by modulating the transmitted sequence with the bases. Fourier bases are well motivated for modeling rapidly fading mobile communication channels when multipath propagation caused by a few dominant reflectors gives rise to (Doppler induced) linearly varying path delays. <p> When channel (or Doppler) diversity is complemented by temporal, or, spatial diversity (available with oversampling or multiple antennas) blind estimators of LTV channels along with direct equalizers become available even with minimal (persistence-of-excitation) assumptions about the input and the bases <ref> [133] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: and thus utilize bandwidth efficiently, self-recovering (a.k.a. blind) algorithms have received attention over the last dozen years for identifying the channel or estimating the equalizer directly using output data only a feature also important when information transmission cannot be interrupted for training as for example in broadcasting and multicasting scenaria <ref> [143] </ref>, [26], [117]. The success of blind methods in a communications context depends on maximum exploitation of input features such as whiteness, non-Gaussianity, finite alphabet, constant modulus, cyclostationarity properties that equalizers are often designed to restore at their outputs by optimizing pertinent criteria. <p> Some of these input properties can be imposed by the transmitter design (e.g., periodically inserted guard times or constant modulus <ref> [143] </ref>, [416], [3]) and from this point of view blind schemes can be thought of as semi-blind identification approaches because the input may be unknown to the receiver but its characteristics which can be imposed at the transmitter are known a distinct difference with time series modeling applications where the input <p> Blind equalizers of FIR frequency-selective channels do not need to acquire timing because they absorb it in the channel itself.

Reference-contexts: This procedure is repeated for a sufficiently large number of times. The Metropolis algorithm was later generalized by Hastings to non-symmetric sampling distributions, which is known as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm <ref> [155] </ref>. A third MCMC method is the Gibbs sampler which employs conditional sampling and may be considered as a special case of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The parameter vector is divided in subvectors, and each of them is drawn conditional on the remaining subvectors.

Reference-contexts: Vector sensors are commercially available and actively researched. EMC Baden Ltd. in Baden, Switzerland, manufactures them for a 75Hz-30MHz frequency range, and Flam and Russell, Inc. in Horsham, PA, for 2MHz-30MHz. Lincoln Labs at MIT has performed preliminary localization tests with the vector sensors of Flam and Russell, Inc. <ref> [156] </ref>. Other research on sensor development is reported in [189], [190]. EM vector sensors are sensitive to both the direction and polarization information in the incoming waves. The polarization provides a crucial criterion for distinguishing and isolating signals that may otherwise overlap in conventional scalar-sensor arrays.

Reference-contexts: They are useful for mitigation of nonlinear effects [24], and blind estimation of LTI channels because they complement channel magnitude response information (conveyed by SOS) with complete phase response information which allows equalization of nonminimum phase channels [430], [131], [370], and <ref> [157] </ref>. However, HOS exhibit high-variance and channel variations may violate the stationarity assumption as the receiver collects long records required for reliable HOS estimation.

It was shown that the extra velocity-field information removes all ambiguities such as grating lobes.

Reference-contexts: The theory has been extended to arbitrarily-sampled spatial data [46, 243] but, for irregularly sampled time series, interpolation may be a viable alternative [409, 410]. Turning to non-stationary processes, multitaper spectrograms have been in use since shortly after the invention of multitaper estimates, see <ref> [401, 224, 191, 336, 312, 164] </ref>. Multitaper wavelets [85, 234, 80] have also been used. <p> Multitaper wavelets [85, 234, 80] have also been used. For weakly nonstationary processes, quadratic-inverse theory [402, 403, 406] works well (the first few coefficients are nearly the time-derivatives of the spectrum) while, in violently nonstationary examples, estimates of the Loeve, or two-frequency, spectrum <ref> [398, 359, 263, 164] </ref> often give more insight. Taking a singular value decomposition of a log multitaper spectrogram is often useful, [401]. Narrow band tracking filters [223] and projection filters [404, 405], and inverse-theory reconstructions [302] are in use.

Such sites have been suggested as suitable for the relocation of dredge materials from harbors and shipping channels, where their buildup has a detrimental impact upon economy and military security. Algorithms for detecting possible release of pollutants near these sites were developed, and their performance was analyzed.

Reference-contexts: BSS is an `output-only' technique in the sense that neither source signals nor training sequences are available: all of the available information is contained in the observed data themselves. Two seminal papers on this topic are those by Jutten et al. <ref> [188] </ref> and Comon [74]. The major strength of the blind approach to source separation stems precisely from the fact that a precise model of the underlying physical phenomena, e.g., wave generation, propagation, and transduction, is not required.

Reference-contexts: An alternative which can frequently lead to better finite sample performance is the application of the principle of invariance [355], also called exact robustness <ref> [192] </ref>. The method of invariance involves expressing uncertainty in the unknown clutter covariance as resulting from set of algebraic actions on the image by an appropriate group of transformations.

Reference-contexts: Narrow band tracking filters [223] and projection filters [404, 405], and inverse-theory reconstructions [302] are in use. These have been used in a series of papers applying signal processing methods to study the relationship between atmospheric CO 2 and global warming, <ref> [218, 405, 193, 406] </ref>; the warming is mostly CO 2 and, more disturbing, the seasonal cycle is also being disrupted by human use of fossil fuels. To summarize: if you are estimating spectra, you should be using multitaper estimates.

Reference-contexts: estimation algorithms, applications in point processes, synchronization and multi-user problems in communications, and performance analyses of algorithms. 9.2 Infinite variance models Heavy-tailed non-Gaussian processes, particularly the Gaussian mixture model and the Cauchy r.v., have long been used to develop and test signal processing techniques which are robust to impulsive noise <ref> [194] </ref>. The Cauchy r.v. has infinite variance, and is a special case of an alpha-stable r.v. It is easy to create a Cauchy r.v. as the ratio of two (possibly correlated) Gaussian random variables and Feller [108] shows how the Cauchy r.v. arises in an example with rotating mirrors.

Reference-contexts: Equalization of linear FIR channels with training is commonly used in practice especially with wired line transmissions over telephone lines, cable television, and asymmetric digital subscriber loops (ADSL); see e.g., [248], [326], <ref> [195] </ref>, and [343].

Reference-contexts: Wide adoption of the EM algorithm was hindered by its disappointingly slow convergence speed. Efforts to improve the convergence of EM include: Aitken's acceleration [247]; overrelaxation [229], conjugate gradient <ref> [196, 180] </ref>; Newton methods [262, 38]; quasi-Newton methods [220]; ordered subsets EM (OSEM) [178]. Unfortunately, these methods do not automatically guarantee the monotone increasing likelihood property of standard EM, leading to the additional burden of monitoring for instability [222].

Reference-contexts: Since the Gaussian environment is the least favorable, exploitation of the non-Gaussian pdf can lead to significantly improved performance, although this usually involves non-linear signal processing <ref> [199] </ref>. Optimal estimation/detection may be feasible if the multivariate pdfs are analytically known (and tractable). If we have access only to training data (or if the signal is weak), the noise pdf can be estimated using various approaches (kernel density approaches, stabilized histogram estimators, type-based estimators, etc).

Reference-contexts: Their method is based on the optimization of the variance-bias tradeoff using knowledge of certain second and fourth order moments. The results of this optimization are kernels very different from those considered by invoking the quasi-stationary assumption. Kayhan, El-Jaroudi, and Chaparro have revived in <ref> [203] </ref>, and also in follow up publications, the evolutionary spectrum (ES) considered by Priestley [322].

Reference-contexts: In many cases direct min-max optimization is difficult and simpler suboptimal CFAR alternatives are of interest. The conceptually simplest approach is the GLR "estimate and plug" procedure which requires computing maximum likelihood estimates for the unknown noise parameters. In <ref> [204] </ref> the GLR principle produced an adaptive detector for detecting spatio-temporal signals or targets in Gaussian noise with unknown spatial covariance.

A related and important result was presented in [333] where exact confidence regions for the GLR-maximizing signal vector were derived for unknown spatial covari-ance. Additional applications of the GLR strategy to multi-spectral infrared images were presented in [330] and [465].

Lincoln Laboratory, </institution> <month> April, </month> <year> 1989. </year>
Reference-contexts: There are a wide range of different strategies available for designing CFAR detectors including: min-max hypothesis testing [109], similar and unbiased hypothesis testing [227], invariant hypothesis testing [278], and the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test <ref> [205] </ref>. For lack of space we focus only on CFAR detection using the min-max, GLR, and invariant testing approaches. We regretfully must omit work in adaptive detection for assumed known noise backgrounds, nonparametric techniques, distributed detection, Huber robust detection, sequential detection, signal classification, and detection of number of signals. <p> In [204] the GLR principle produced an adaptive detector for detecting spatio-temporal signals or targets in Gaussian noise with unknown spatial covariance.

Reference-contexts: However, there are two factors which can make the GLR test unworkable in applications: 1) the GLR may not be of closed form when the clutter covariance has special structure, e.g., block diagonal; 2) use of the GLR principle entails a loss in efficiency <ref> [331, 206] </ref> which can severely impact finite sample performance. An alternative which can frequently lead to better finite sample performance is the application of the principle of invariance [355], also called exact robustness [192].

Reference-contexts: nonstationary problems. 5.2 When do you use multitaper estimates? Generally, multitaper methods have become the estimate of choice for serious spectrum estimation problems, are becoming "routine" in geophysics, [393], and, with an excellent text on the subject [307] and availability in MATLAB, appear to be becoming so in other fields, <ref> [238, 208] </ref>. A quick survey of papers describing work using multitaper methods shows that most of the early applications were scientific.

Reference-contexts: CFAR detectors have also been derived based on summary statistics such as: order statistical filter outputs [453], higher order spectra <ref> [209, 167] </ref>; matched filter multiple-correlation lag products [134]; weighted sub-space fitting residuals [445]; and adaptive filtering followed by subspace projections [228].

Reference-contexts: MCMC methods have also been very useful in enhancing speech and music signals, which are degraded by non-Gaussian noise characterized by impulses superimposed on a Gaussian background [144]. Finally, in addition to its extensive application to static images, Gibbs sampling has been employed in enhancement of degraded video images <ref> [210] </ref>. With the ever growing power of modern computers, MCMC methods are becoming very useful tools for tackling even the most difficult signal processing problems. In the years to come these methods will become more sophisticated, efficient and accurate, undoubtedly leading to many new and effective signal processing algorithms.

Reference-contexts: focusing on the multiresolution modeling aimed more at large scale estimation and classification problems. 7.2 Multiscale Statistical Signal Analysis and Modeling On the analysis front the good localization properties of wavelets have played a key role in the development of various applications such as compression [253, 328] and signal reconstruction <ref> [253, 94, 211, 275, 347] </ref> (also referred to as denoising). <p> Other developments ensued as other interpretations of signal enhancement or denoising were adopted.

Reference-contexts: In particular, these were shown to provide a considerable simplification and usefulness for turbulence signals. Other applications where fractal signals have shown promise include biomedical, biochemistry [1] and communications [461]. Other multiscale analyses of related processes, such as nonstationary processes with stationary increments <ref> [49, 212] </ref> 2 have resulted in stationarizing properties, thus allowing the application of classical statistical techniques and equally important a deeper understanding of other nonstationary parametric processes [212]. <p> Other multiscale analyses of related processes, such as nonstationary processes with stationary increments [49, 212] 2 have resulted in stationarizing properties, thus allowing the application of classical statistical techniques and equally important a deeper understanding of other nonstationary parametric processes <ref> [212] </ref>.

To summarize: if you are estimating spectra, you should be using multitaper estimates.

Many follow-up papers appeared on this topic in the medical imaging community (see e.g. [110] for a partial list) before the EM algorithm was applied to other signal processing problems such as parameter estimation for multiple superimposed signals [106, 107] and direction finding [271].

In the context of statistical signal processing one must also contend with additional constraints: the exceedingly large size of signal processing datasets; the absence of reliable and tractible signal models; the associated requirement of fast algorithms; and the requirement of real time unsupervised algorithms. <p> For such a test statistic the detection threshold can be set to guarantee a prespecified false alarm rate. There are a wide range of different strategies available for designing CFAR detectors including: min-max hypothesis testing [109], similar and unbiased hypothesis testing <ref> [227] </ref>, invariant hypothesis testing [278], and the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test [205]. For lack of space we focus only on CFAR detection using the min-max, GLR, and invariant testing approaches. <p> These statistics are called "maximal invariants," and the resultant LR tests are called CFAR invariant tests. Many simple examples exist for which invariance principles give CFAR tests with higher power than the GLR test (for a simple but nontrivial example see <ref> [227, Ex. 6.18] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: This led to the "space alternating expectation maximization" (SAGE) algorithm, its main feature being that it only updates small groups of the parameters, e.g., a single coordinate, at each iteration yet preserves monotonicity. In this respect SAGE resembles the "expectation conditional maximization either" (ECME) <ref> [239] </ref> but SAGE generally has faster convergence [265]. In Meng and Van Dyk's paper [265] a generalization of SAGE and ECME was introduced called "alternating expectation conditional maximization" (AECM) which is a SAGE algorithm with a "design parameter" similar to SAGE-3 introduced in [111].

Reference-contexts: The tree-like structure of the wavelet analysis framework has also led to efficient multiresolution stochastic modeling techniques with a remarkable impact on large scale physics-based estimation and classification problems <ref> [19, 249] </ref>. 7.2.1 Fractal Analysis Fractal analysis has been the focus of interest in signal processing for almost two decades and continues to play an important role in the applications fields such as compression, analysis of turbulence, and communications. <p> This led to modeling algorithms with high efficiency as a result of the tree-like structure of the analysis. The generality of this modeling technique comes from the fact that the nodes may be interpreted differently depending on the application <ref> [249] </ref>, and the appeal of easily implementable algorithms. Other extensions included the introduction of time dynamics [174] with a variety of applications. One interesting applications is to ground water hydrology where measurements are in fact multiresolution over space, resulting in very efficient data fusion algorithms and subsequent estimation procedures [83].

Reference-contexts: The wavelet theory [86] provided a powerful framework to meet this challenge, and gained further prominence upon the ingenious connection, made by Mallat <ref> [253] </ref>, with the then well known filter bank theory [437, 444]. The orthonormal wavelet analysis afforded in many cases, analytical tractability and, equally important, an efficient tracking of the statistical properties at different scales. <p> nonlinear estimation, and the second focusing on the multiresolution modeling aimed more at large scale estimation and classification problems. 7.2 Multiscale Statistical Signal Analysis and Modeling On the analysis front the good localization properties of wavelets have played a key role in the development of various applications such as compression <ref> [253, 328] </ref> and signal reconstruction [253, 94, 211, 275, 347] (also referred to as denoising). <p> focusing on the multiresolution modeling aimed more at large scale estimation and classification problems. 7.2 Multiscale Statistical Signal Analysis and Modeling On the analysis front the good localization properties of wavelets have played a key role in the development of various applications such as compression [253, 328] and signal reconstruction <ref> [253, 94, 211, 275, 347] </ref> (also referred to as denoising). <p> These noise directions are then discarded and the former used in the reconstruction. The development of this thrust is marked by three phases which took place in sequence. Signal in Gaussian Noise: Using to advantage the energy compaction property of wavelets, Mallat and Hwang <ref> [253] </ref> first showed that effective noise suppression may be achieved by transforming the noisy signal into the wavelet domain, and preserving only the local maxima of the transform for subsequent reconstruction. <p> They showed that a certain optimality was achieved by thresholding all wavelet coefficients of x (t) below T = p 2 2 log K. Specifically, given that a wavelet basis is an unconditional basis for a great many smoothness spaces <ref> [253] </ref>, they showed that the reconstruction error was within a scalar multiple of the minimum worst case error over these signal spaces. Other developments ensued as other interpretations of signal enhancement or denoising were adopted. <p> Gaussian noise, leads to an estimate which is a tradeoff between a Wiener and a thresholding estimator [309]. 7.2.5 Multiresolution Modeling Multiresolution modeling first appeared in the context of data compression <ref> [253] </ref>. Its recent increased prominence is largely due to the computational efficiency of a filter bank implementation. This led to a multitude of applications, and one of particular interest herein, is the clever recast-ing of time recursive filtering into scale recursive filtering [19].

The statistics associated with these characteristics and/or their evolution across scales may provide unique and powerful signatures. <p> The fractal structure of many natural phenomena for instance (e.g. the coast line of a continent, the patterns on a tree leaf, etc.) may be viewed as the result of statistically self-similar patterns <ref> [254, 461] </ref>. The ubiquity of such phenomena in physical processes has called for a systematic and efficient methodology to capture the multiscale trend and preserve the statistics at the various scales for further processing.

Using the parsimony-achieving potential of wavelets, other well adapted analyses were proposed [84] for identification/synthesis of turbulent velocity signals.

Reference-contexts: The work in this area has successfully led to the generalization, estimation, and the linkage of ES to TFDs. For processes with restricted time-frequency correlation, referred to as underspread nonstationary random processes, it has been shown by Matz, Hlawatsch, and Kozek in <ref> [258] </ref> that major definitions of time-varying spectra, such as the generalized Wigner-Ville spectrum and generalized evolutionary spectrum, yield effectively equivalent results. The concept of underspread processes proves useful in analyzing Doppler shifts and fading communication channels using time-frequency structures. TFDs have been examined for detection of nonstationary signals.

For "traditional" stationary, Gaussian processes spectrum estimates have chi-square distributions. In practice, however, confidence intervals based on these were often wildly optimistic, and resampling estimates based on the jackknife [407] and bootstrap [473] are becoming common.

Reference-contexts: Multitaper wavelets [85, 234, 80] have also been used. For weakly nonstationary processes, quadratic-inverse theory [402, 403, 406] works well (the first few coefficients are nearly the time-derivatives of the spectrum) while, in violently nonstationary examples, estimates of the Loeve, or two-frequency, spectrum <ref> [398, 359, 263, 164] </ref> often give more insight. Taking a singular value decomposition of a log multitaper spectrogram is often useful, [401]. Narrow band tracking filters [223] and projection filters [404, 405], and inverse-theory reconstructions [302] are in use.

Reference-contexts: Notice that a vanishing bispectrum does not necessarily imply that the underlying signal is Gaussian; it may result from the fact that the signal is non-Gaussian with zero bispectrum. Therefore, a next logical step would be to test for vanishing trispectrum of the record. This has been done in <ref> [272] </ref> using the approach of [168]; extensions of [329] are too complicated. Computationally simpler tests using "integrated polyspectrum" of the data have been proposed in [429]. The integrated polyspectrum (bispectrum or trispectrum) is computed as cross-power spectrum and it is zero for Gaussian processes. <p> Hinich [168] has `simplified' the test of [329]. Notice that this test is useless if the signal is non-Gaussian with zero bispectrum. Therefore, a next logical step would be to test a normalized trispectrum (tricoherence function). This has been done in <ref> [272] </ref> using the approach of [168]; extensions of [329] are too complicated. The approaches of [329] and [168] will fail if the data are noisy. A modification to [329] is presented in [428] when additive Gaussian noise is present.

Reference-contexts: SIMO models arise also even when symbol-rate samples are collected by multiple receive-antennas <ref> [276] </ref>, and the excess-bandwidth condition adopted to introduce diversity now translates to sufficient sensor separation in order to guarantee channel disparity (co-primeness of the SIMO transfer functions). <p> (ii)with appropriate initialization, adaptive equalization algorithms can be globally convergent at least in high-SNR environments [232]; (iii)so long as the input sequence is persistently exciting (a minimal condition for identifiability) it is allowed to be colored or even deterministic which is important for coded sequences which are non-white; see e.g., <ref> [276] </ref>, [463]. Recent attempts focus on inducing cyclostationarity or diversity at the transmitter by means of periodic modulating sequences or redundant filterbank precoders [424], [128], [60], [368], [353].

Reference-contexts: The self-similarity naturally leads to wavelet-based analysis, see e.g., [2]. Semi-parametric techniques, based on log-periodogram regression, are proposed for estimating the fractal dimension in <ref> [277] </ref>, and fractal point process models have been proposed in [14, 219, 344], but several interesting analysis and synthesis problems remain open. 9.4 Multiplicative noise Just as non-linearities give rise to non-Gaussianity, they also lead to non-additive noise.

Reference-contexts: For such a test statistic the detection threshold can be set to guarantee a prespecified false alarm rate. There are a wide range of different strategies available for designing CFAR detectors including: min-max hypothesis testing [109], similar and unbiased hypothesis testing [227], invariant hypothesis testing <ref> [278] </ref>, and the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test [205]. For lack of space we focus only on CFAR detection using the min-max, GLR, and invariant testing approaches.

Reference-contexts: In practice, however, confidence intervals based on these were often wildly optimistic, and resampling estimates based on the jackknife [407] and bootstrap [473] are becoming common. For a comparison of resampling methods, see [116]. For explicitly non-Gaussian data, multitaper bispec-trum estimates have been developed, <ref> [399, 279] </ref>, and work well. (A few of the difficulties encountered with nonstationary and non-gaussian data are discussed elsewhere in this article.) 5.3 Variations on the multiple-window theme Using a different error norm for solving the integral equation Riedel and Sidorenko [334, 335] developed a multitaper "sine" estimate.

These developments have coincided with a surge of interest in particle velocity sensors [27] and improvements in fabrication techniques [97] to make vector-sensor arrays a practical reality <ref> [290] </ref>. Since a vector sensor extracts directional information directly from the structure of the velocity field, it can, for example, locate up to two sources in 3D space [175]. By making use of this extra information, arrays of vector sensors improve source localization accuracy while using smaller array apertures.

Reference-contexts: In most cases of interest, however, such sampling is impossible. A more practical method is to generate samples from simpler distributions followed by approximation of the integrals by sample averages. One of these methods is importance sampling [28], [123], <ref> [297] </ref>. The generating distributions are called importance sampling functions, and their choice is crucial because the variance of the estimated integrals is critically dependent on them. A related procedure is sampling-importance resampling, which generates samples from the posterior distribution by repeated sampling from simpler distributions [342]. <p> Submitted to IEEE SP Magazine, June 1998 11 Another approach is to use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods [28], [123], [137], <ref> [297] </ref>, [392]. These methods have extended the Bayesian methodology to many previously intractable applications. The key idea is to generate samples by running an ergodic Markov chain whose distribution after convergence is the desired posterior distribution.

Reference-contexts: However, there are two factors which can make the GLR test unworkable in applications: 1) the GLR may not be of closed form when the clutter covariance has special structure, e.g., block diagonal; 2) use of the GLR principle entails a loss in efficiency <ref> [331, 206] </ref> which can severely impact finite sample performance. An alternative which can frequently lead to better finite sample performance is the application of the principle of invariance [355], also called exact robustness [192].

Reference-contexts: Observe that the sidelobe levels are substantially lower than those of the Bartlett processor in true source position.

In addition, it is worth noting that wideband matched-field processing, usually achieved by incoherently averaging ambiguity surfaces across frequency often significantly increases robustness to mismatch.

Reference-contexts: Amin has also derived the optimum kernels for reducing spectral variance when dealing with nonstationary signal in additive white Gaussian noise [5]. Sayeed and Jones <ref> [350] </ref> proposed a minimum mean square error estimation of the WVS. Their method is based on the optimization of the variance-bias tradeoff using knowledge of certain second and fourth order moments. The results of this optimization are kernels very different from those considered by invoking the quasi-stationary assumption. <p> Almost one decade ago, Flandrin [113] provided a coherent framework for Wigner-Ville time-frequency receivers. It was shown that classical receiver structures designed for optimum detection of Gaussian signals in Gaussian noise admit an equivalent formulation in the time-frequency domain. The work by Sayeed and Jones <ref> [350] </ref> has gone past the mere equivalence of to classical optimum detectors to exploit the time-frequency structures in composite hypothesis tests where an optimum quadratic detector is implemented at each time-frequency point. Time-frequency distributions have recently found applications to radar and sensor array processing.

Reference-contexts: Multitaper wavelets [85, 234, 80] have also been used. For weakly nonstationary processes, quadratic-inverse theory [402, 403, 406] works well (the first few coefficients are nearly the time-derivatives of the spectrum) while, in violently nonstationary examples, estimates of the Loeve, or two-frequency, spectrum <ref> [398, 359, 263, 164] </ref> often give more insight. Taking a singular value decomposition of a log multitaper spectrogram is often useful, [401]. Narrow band tracking filters [223] and projection filters [404, 405], and inverse-theory reconstructions [302] are in use.

Reference-contexts: They are useful for mitigation of nonlinear effects [24], and blind estimation of LTI channels because they complement channel magnitude response information (conveyed by SOS) with complete phase response information which allows equalization of nonminimum phase channels [430], [131], <ref> [370] </ref>, and [157]. However, HOS exhibit high-variance and channel variations may violate the stationarity assumption as the receiver collects long records required for reliable HOS estimation. <p> In addition, methods that rely on the constant-modulus (restoral) algorithm (CMA) do not require frequency offset estimation [143], [416].

Reference-contexts: An important consequence of the LPTV-SISO and LTI-SIMO structures under such time- or space-diversity conditions, is that LTI FIR channels can be equalized exactly by FIR equalizers of the same or greater order; see e.g., <ref> [376] </ref>. Recall that LTI-SISO channels with zeros on the unit circle cannot be inverted and even with MMSE (Wiener) equalizers performance drops due to noise amplification at the frequencies of the channel nulls.

Reference-contexts: Especially for code-division multiple access (CDMA) systems entailing asynchronous users, correct timing acquisition affects performance considerably, and a variety of methods (including subspace approaches) have been proposed recently (see e.g., <ref> [383] </ref>, [25]). Blind equalizers of FIR frequency-selective channels do not need to acquire timing because they absorb it in the channel itself. In addition, methods that rely on the constant-modulus (restoral) algorithm (CMA) do not require frequency offset estimation [143], [416]. <p> Such self-recovering CDMA receivers were proposed recently in [420], [474], <ref> [383] </ref>, [241], [25], and [419]. They capitalize on code diversity offered by the user code (s) and the received data but have relatively high complexity especially because they adopt subspace decomposition (via the SVD) of large matrices for signature waveform estimation.

Reference-contexts: The cumulants of a stationary-random process (or of a random vector) can be represented either as tensors or as m-D matrices. Several results in the scalar case can be generalized to the vector case by replacing scalar multiplications with Kronecker products <ref> [386] </ref>. But, notions related to rank, eigenvector decomposition, diagonalization etc are largely unsolved, but some interesting results may be found in [75, 76] where relationships with the theory of homogeneous multi-variable polynomials are established.

Reference-contexts: Since non-Gaussian processes are not completely characterized by their first and second-order moments, higher-order statistical descriptors, such as the higher-order moments and cumulants, and their Fourier transforms, the moment and cumulant spectra ("HOS") are required. Consequently, in the last two decades, lot of attention has centered around HOS <ref> [320, 264, 291, 292, 315, 387] </ref>. <p> The interest of the Signal Processing and Systems communities perked up in the early 1980's, due partly to a US-ONR funded initiative in non-Gaussian processes [450]. Subsequently there have been five biannual international workshops and several special issues devoted to the subject; a comprehensive bibliography may be found in <ref> [387] </ref>. The success of HOS-based methods depends clearly on the amount of non-Gaussianity and non-linearity of the underlying processes and models; hence, tests of Gaussianity and linearity are important. HOS-based methods typically entail an increase in dimensionality, computational load and statistical variance of the sample estimators.

Reference-contexts: Alpha-stable processes may be used to model very impulsive noise, and they can be suppressed (to some extent) using the usual tools of ranks, weighted medians and order statistics. Locally optimum detectors may also be used [293]; another alternative is to use data-adaptive non-linearities <ref> [388] </ref>. Impulsive noise suppression is particularly important for compression and dynamic range reduction. Model validation is important, and several ideas are discussed in [294] and [295]. Differentiating between non-linearity and non-stationarity may be more difficult than in the finite variance case [87].

Reference-contexts: An array of spatially distributed vector sensors can additionally exploit time delays among the sensors.

Reference-contexts: When the signal model is non-linear or the signal is non-Gaussian the Kalman or extended Kalman filters can give very poor performance. A powerful alternative is to use Bayesian filters based on sequential importance or Gibbs samplings [52], [146], <ref> [391] </ref>. A signal processing application of the Metropolis algorithm is parameter estimation of damped sinusoids [16]. When joint detection of sinusoids and the estimation of their parameters are of interest, the reversible jump MCMC has been successfully applied [7], [91].

Reference-contexts: The orthogonal wavelet representation of fractal processes entirely reflect the properties (statistical or others) residing at different scales. Such analysis led to significant advances in fully and accurately identifying fractal and multifractal signals [179], and in other related synthesis problems of fractional Brownian motion <ref> [114, 461, 395, 257] </ref>. Using the parsimony-achieving potential of wavelets, other well adapted analyses were proposed [84] for identification/synthesis of turbulent velocity signals. In particular, these were shown to provide a considerable simplification and usefulness for turbulence signals.

In addition, methods that rely on the constant-modulus (restoral) algorithm (CMA) do not require frequency offset estimation [143], <ref> [416] </ref>.

In some of these papers nonstandard assumptions were made, which make the direct estimation problem quite intractable. Analysis of mixed spectra within a hierarchical Bayesian framework was proposed in [53] via an MCMC algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The available methods have been well analyzed in excellent texts such as [377, 244, 245]. The text by Widrow and Stearns contains a wide range of applications <ref> [451] </ref>. A typical approach is to choose a model structure with fixed (order) order, e.g. state space models with known state dimension, autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models with known AR and MA model orders, MA models, etc., and then turn the system identification problem into one of parameter estimation. <p> The choice of the model structure is dictated by the intended application. For instance, <ref> [451] </ref> favors using MA models for adaptive signal processing in applications where the stability of the fitted model is paramount. A large number of methods exist for parameter estimation including least-squares, prediction error minimization, maximum likelihood, instrumental variable methods, output error minimization and others [377, 244, 245].

Reference-contexts: The fractal structure of many natural phenomena for instance (e.g. the coast line of a continent, the patterns on a tree leaf, etc.) may be viewed as the result of statistically self-similar patterns <ref> [254, 461] </ref>. The ubiquity of such phenomena in physical processes has called for a systematic and efficient methodology to capture the multiscale trend and preserve the statistics at the various scales for further processing. <p> The orthogonal wavelet representation of fractal processes entirely reflect the properties (statistical or others) residing at different scales. Such analysis led to significant advances in fully and accurately identifying fractal and multifractal signals [179], and in other related synthesis problems of fractional Brownian motion <ref> [114, 461, 395, 257] </ref>. Using the parsimony-achieving potential of wavelets, other well adapted analyses were proposed [84] for identification/synthesis of turbulent velocity signals.
