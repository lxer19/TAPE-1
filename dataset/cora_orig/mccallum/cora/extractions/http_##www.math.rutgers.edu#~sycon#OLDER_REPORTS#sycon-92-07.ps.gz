Note: On the other hand, observability of the pair (A; C) is no longer sufficient if one does not assume B 2 B. To illustrate this point, consider the following example. Example 5.1 Pick any two nonzero real values 1 2 in the image of such that:  C 2 1 Given (13) it is easy to see that the pair (A; C) is observable; however the nonlinear system is not. In fact, the state 1 2 is an equilibrium state and Cx 0, so it is indistinguishable  [2]  Introduction to the Theory of Neural Computation, Addison-Wesley,  IEEE Trans.Circuits and Syst., CAS-26(1979): 342-356.

Abstract: Corollary 2.1 showed that, if B 2 B, observability of the pair (A; C) implies that the system of interest is observable. But the converse is not true. For an example, consider any system in which each column of C is nonzero but A is a nonsingular diagonal matrix, such as A = I. In this case, the pair (A; C) is not observable (if n &gt; 1 and ker C 6= 0), but, from Corollary 2.4, we have that, if B 2 B, the system is observable. [1] Albertini, F., and E.D.
