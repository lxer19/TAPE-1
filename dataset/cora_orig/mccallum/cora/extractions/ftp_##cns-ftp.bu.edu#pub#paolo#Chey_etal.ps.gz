Reference-contexts: In their network, reinforcement leads to a bias in head-waving by means of a synaptic modification rule known as activity-dependent neuromodulation. This form of synaptic modification was originally developed by Gingrich and Byrne (1985, 1987), and has been used to explain certain aspects of classical conditioning in Aplysia <ref> (Buonomano, Baxter, & Byrne, 1990) </ref>. With their model, Raymond et al. (1992) were able to simulate many aspects of operant conditioning of the Aplysia head-waving behavior when waving to one side is paired with reinforcement.

Reference-contexts: In the work of <ref> (Cook & Carew, 1986) </ref>, the punishment consisted of uniform bright lights, and the targeted behavior was the Aplysia's head-waving behavior, which takes the form of slow movements of the head from one side to the other.

Reference-contexts: A series of additional experiments <ref> (Cook & Carew, 1989a, 1989b) </ref> demonstrated that the behavioral bias is strictly dependent on contingency (that is, on the pairing between movement to one side and light onset), and that a similar bias can be induced when the contingency is based directly on the activity of neck muscles that contribute to

Reference-contexts: This research project was initially motivated by the similarity between the model of Raymond et al. (1992) and the READ circuit of Grossberg and Schmajuk (1987), one type of recurrent gated dipole that has been used to account for several aspects of classical conditioning <ref> (see Gaudiano et al., 1994) </ref>. In the course of this investigation we have uncovered some problems with the model of Raymond et al., and we have proposed a new way of interpreting the original experimental data. <p> If verified experimentally, this prediction would clearly refute the hypothesis that the behavioral bias is the result of operant conditioning. 6.2 Comparison between the two models The initial thrust for the work reported here came from the ostensible similarity between Raymond et al.'s model and the recurrent gated dipole <ref> (Gaudiano et al., 1994) </ref>. A direct comparison in terms of model performance is not simple, because the simulations of Raymond et al. are not directly comparable to the experimental results of Cook and Carew (1986) for various reasons, as outlined earlier in this paper. <p> A direct comparison in terms of model performance is not simple, because the simulations of Raymond et al. are not directly comparable to the experimental results of Cook and Carew (1986) for various reasons, as outlined earlier in this paper.

Reference-contexts: Equations (4) and (5) are meant to capture a property of neural transmission in a simplified fashion. In reality, as suggested by Grossberg <ref> (see Sec. IX of Grossberg, 1974) </ref>, the quantity z i should not represent the total amount of transmitter available in the synapse, but rather the amount of transmitter that is available for release into the synaptic cleft.

Reference-contexts: The recurrent gated dipole includes a set of connections from the output of each channel back to the input. These feedback, or recurrent connections have been utilized to explain certain aspects of classical conditioning <ref> (Grossberg & Schmajuk, 1987) </ref>. More germane to the present article is the fact that the recurrent connections can lead to spontaneous oscillations, whereby activity repeatedly alternates between the two channels.

Reference-contexts: The gated dipole is a simple neural circuit that has been used as a building block in a variety of dynamic neural network models for conditioning, vision, motor control, and other aspects of human and animal behavior <ref> (e.g., Grossberg, 1982, 1986a, 1986b) </ref>. The gated dipole embodies two fundamental properties: adaptation through neural transmitter gating, and opponent processing through mutually inhibitory connections.

Reference-contexts: However, it is unclear whether this is indeed the case. Kupferman and colleagues have studied the head-waving behavior of Aplysia in the presence of food cues in the environment <ref> (Teyke, Weiss, & Kupfermann, 1990, 1992) </ref>. Their studies seem to indicate that the waving movements are used as a local "probe" that tells the Aplysia when it has come into physical contact with a potential food source. Two examples are particularly telling.
