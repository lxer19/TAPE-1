Abstract: Background traffic models are fundamental to packet-level network simulation since the background traffic impacts packet drop rates, queuing delays, end-to-end delay variation, and also determines available network bandwidth. In this paper, we present a statistical characterization of wide-area IP traffic based on 90-minute traces taken from a week-long trace of packets exchanged between a large campus network, a state-wide educational network, and a large Internet service provider. The results of this analysis can be used to provide a basis for modeling background load in simulations of wide-area packet-switched networks such as the Internet, contribute to understanding the fractal behavior of wide-area network utilization, and provide a benchmark to evaluate the accuracy of existing traffic models. The key findings of our study include the following: (1) both the aggregate packet stream and its component substreams exhibit significant long-range dependencies in agreement with other recent traffic studies, (2) the empirical probability distributions of packet arrivals are log-normally distributed, (3) packet sizes exhibit only short-term correlations, and (4) the packet size distribution and correlation structure are independent from both network utilization and time of day.

Reference-contexts: The larger substreams of the low utilization trace (i.e., 2AM trace) also exhibits the same correlation structure as the aggregate stream. However, in the 2AM trace, the degree of self-similarity decreases with the mean of the substream. This observation is consistent with other studies <ref> [11] </ref>, which determine that sample paths with low utilization exhibit a smaller degree of self-similarity than streams with high utilizations.
