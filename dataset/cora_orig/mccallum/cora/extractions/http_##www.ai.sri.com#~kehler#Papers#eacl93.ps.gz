Title: A Discourse Copying Algorithm for Ellipsis and Anaphora Resolution  
Author: Andrew Kehler

Affiliation: Harvard University Aiken Computation Laboratory  
Abstract: We give an analysis of ellipsis resolution in terms of a straightforward discourse copying algorithm that correctly predicts a wide range of phenomena. The treatment does not suffer from problems inherent in identity-of-relations analyses. Furthermore, in contrast to the approach of Dalrymple et al. [ 1991 ] , the treatment directly encodes the intuitive distinction between full NPs and the referential elements that corefer with them through what we term role linking. The correct predictions for several problematic examples of ellipsis naturally result. Finally, the analysis extends directly to other discourse copying phenomena.

Reference-contexts: voice target clause can obtain its representation from a passive voice source clause (and vice versa), but in these cases there is no surface syntactic VP constituent to copy: (2) A lot of this material can be presented in a fairly informal fashion, and often I do.

Reference-contexts: That happened to Bob too. * Definite Event Anaphora: John kissed his wife, and Bill followed his example. ( <ref> [ Dahl, 1972 ] </ref> ) * `Only': Only John loves his mother. * `One' Anaphora: Although John bought a picture of his son, Bill snapped one himself. Definite NPs and pronouns referring to NPs may also require discourse copying in certain restricted contexts.

Reference-contexts: Following Dalrym-ple et al. [ 1991 ] , we distinguish between identity-of-relations analyses (e.g., [ Gawron and Peters, 1990; Klein, 1987; Sag, 1976; Williams, 1977 ] ) and nonidentity analyses <ref> [ Dalrymple et al., 1991 ] </ref> . Identity-of-relations analyses treat source clauses as having ambiguous derivations, with target clauses receiving one such derivation.

Reference-contexts: The following example, from Dahl [ 1972 ] , is termed as a case of cascaded ellipsis in Dalrymple, et al. [ 1991 ] , and is problematic for identity-of-relations analyses: 2 Fiengo and May <ref> [ Fiengo and May, 1990 ] </ref> actually posit copying of LF representations, but their analysis shares the problems of the syntactic accounts. (8) John realizes that he is a fool, but Bill i does not, even though his i wife does.

Reference-contexts: In these cases, strict/sloppy ambiguities are present: * Definite NPs: John actually remembered his wife's birthday. Most men forget this important date. * `Lazy' Pronouns: The man who gives his paycheck to his wife is wiser than the man who spends it. ( <ref> [ Karttunen, 1969 ] </ref> ) We make a distinction between the processes of determining when discourse copying applies and performing the resolution. We show how the representations of some of these examples are resolved by our algorithm. The pronouns it and that can be used to refer to events.
