Abstract: We study the problem of centrally scheduling multiple messages in a linear network, when each message has both a release time and a deadline. We show that the problem of transmitting optimally many messages is NP-hard, both when messages may be buffered in transit and when they may not be; for either case, we present efficient algorithms that produce approximately optimal schedules. In particular, our bufferless scheduling algorithm achieves throughput that is within a factor of two of optimal. We show that buffering can improve throughput in general by a logarithmic factor (but no more), but that in several significant special cases, such as when all messages can be released immediately, buffering can help by only a small constant factor. Finally, we show how to convert our centralized, offline bufferless schedules to equally productive fully z Email: ramesh@cs.umass.edu. Supported in part by an NSF CAREER Award No. CCR-97-03017.

These sources focus on optimizing a global parameter such as overall completion time or average message latency: individual messages do not have deadlines.

Several recent studies focus on bufferless routing algorithms, which allow simpler, faster switches.

Reference-contexts: The analogous shift in the development of interconnection networks is motivated by emerging real-time applications that rely on time-constrained communication, such as industrial process control, avionics, and automated manufacturing <ref> [41] </ref>. In this paper, we consider the scheduling of the transmission of a given set of time-constrained messages in a multi-node network. Our goal is to deliver as many of the given messages as possible, within the following framework: * Each message consists of a single packet. <p> The Network Model. We focus on routing messages in linear networksalthough most of our results apply also to ring-structured networks. This focus on linear topologies is a first step towards considering more complex interconnection topologies proposed in the literature, such as higher-dimensional arrays <ref> [41] </ref>. There are often also other rationales for the focus, such as the following.
