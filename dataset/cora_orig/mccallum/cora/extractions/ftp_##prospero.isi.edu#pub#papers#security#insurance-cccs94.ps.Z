Title: Endorsements, Licensing, and Insurance for Distributed System Services  
Author: Charlie Lai Gennady Medvinsky B. Clifford Neuman 
Affiliation: Information Sciences Institute University of Southern California  
Abstract: Clients in a distributed system place their confidence in many servers, and servers themselves rely on other servers for file storage, authentication, authorization, and payment. When a system spans administrative boundaries it becomes harder to assess the security and competence of potential service providers. This paper examines the issue of confidence in large distributed systems. When confidence is lacking in the "real world," one relies on endorsements, licensing, insurance, and surety bonds to compensate. We show that by incorporating such assurances into a distributed system, users are better able to evaluate the risks incurred when using a particular server. This paper describes a method to electronically represent endorsements, licenses, and insurance policies, and discusses the means by which clients use such items when selecting service providers.

Reference-contexts: Cross-realm authentication allows individuals registered with one authentication server to prove their identity to those registered with different authentication servers. Global cross-realm authentication is supported by several authentication systems [10, 12], and techniques for assessing confidence in foreign authentication servers has been discussed widely in the literature <ref> [1, 3, 4] </ref>. Most approaches require a hierarchical organization of realms, with trust relationships following the hierarchy. Assurance of the authority of an authentication server is provided by credentials issued by other servers in the hierar chy.

Reference-contexts: The procedures of such authentication servers may be assessed by independent auditors, resulting in an endorsement that improves confidence by parties that trust the independent auditor. 7.2 Electronic Currency Currency servers <ref> [2, 6] </ref> issue electronic currency and provide services for currency exchange.

As with paper money, electronic currency should be backed, directly or indirectly, by real value.

Reference-contexts: The party to be insured against loss or liability is called the `assured' or `insured,' and the causes of damage, loss or liability are `risks' or `hazards'." <ref> [5] </ref> A liability insurance contract is an agreement between an insurance provider and the insured. This contract, called a policy, specifies the obligations of the parties involved. The policy covers damages inflicted by the insured upon a third party if the damages were caused by an accident or occurrence. <p> The policy covers damages inflicted by the insured upon a third party if the damages were caused by an accident or occurrence. The words "accident" and "occurrence" do not include damages caused willfully by the insured. Liability insurance does not relieve the insured from responsibility for committing malicious acts. <ref> [5] </ref> Surety bonding closely resembles liability insurance. The major distinction is that a liability insurance policy represents an agreement between two parties, and a surety bond represents an agreement among three parties: the surety, the obligee, and the principal. <p> If the insured's situation or position changes, altering the assumed risk, the insurance provider has the right to alter the policy or charge a different premium <ref> [5] </ref>. Insurance providers will need to assess a service provider's procedures, past behavior, etc., to determine whether to insure the service provider and to set a premium.

Reference-contexts: In computer systems, these assurances can be represented by certificates digitally signed by the endorser, licensing authority, or insurance provider. Such assurance credentials would be granted to a server after it meets the requirements set by the organization issuing the credentials <ref> [7] </ref>. c flAssociation for Computing Machinery 1994. This paper will appear in the Proceedings of the Second ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, November 1994.

Reference-contexts: To incorporate such mechanisms into a distributed system, we first define the basic representation of assurance credentials. 4.1 Representation of Assurance Credentials An assurance credential can be an insurance policy, a surety bond, a license, or an endorsement. We represent such a credential as a restricted proxy <ref> [8] </ref>. A proxy is a token that enables one principal to operate with the privileges of another principal. A restricted proxy is a proxy that allows the exercise of such privileges for a particular purpose, subject to a specified set of conditions and restrictions. <p> The proxy is signed by the grantor. This is represented abstractly in the figure by square brackets; the encryption keys used for the signature depend on the proxy implementation. The grantee or delegate is the principal to whom the proxy is issued, in this case the service provider. Although <ref> [8] </ref> calls the verifier of a proxy the end-server, such terminology is confusing here since the verifier of an assurance credential is the client of the service provider; consequently, we will use the term verifier instead. Proxies can be divided into two classes: Bearer proxies and delegate proxies. <p> The verifier validates the certificate and checks to see that the delegate is included in the list of delegates. Both forms of proxies are suitable for representing assurance credentials. Proxies may be implemented using either conventional or public-key cryptography. Both implementations are described in <ref> [8] </ref>. By defining assurance credentials as proxies, we free our mechanisms from dependence on a particular encryption algorithm. We also inherit the infrastructure needed to verify such credentials, and a structured framework within which the characteristics of the credential may be enumerated. <p> In message 1, the client requests proof of assurance from the candidate service provider. The assurance is presented to the client in message 4 in a form that varies with different proxy implementations. Refer to <ref> [8] </ref> for details. If the service provider requires a separate credential for each client (which will be the case in a conventional cryptography implementation), it requests and retrieves such a credential in messages 2 and 3. <p> The records and procedures of the currency server would be endorsed by independent auditors. These auditors can attest to the amount of currency in circulation and can verify that currency servers only issue properly backed currency. 7.3 Accounting Accounting servers <ref> [8] </ref> maintain account balances for users, track consumption of resources, maintain quotas, and more generally act as electronic banks. The confidence of users in such services may be derived from insurance analogous to FDIC insurance of banks in the United States.

Reference-contexts: Information about the assurances available for each service provider could be stored in directory service entries for each service provider, making it easier for applications to choose candidates that meet the assurance criteria <ref> [9] </ref>. Similarly, some endorsers might provide directories of endorsed service providers making it even easier to identify candidate providers.

Reference-contexts: In essence, an authentication server issues assurance credentials where the assurance provided pertains solely to the identity of the individual. Cross-realm authentication allows individuals registered with one authentication server to prove their identity to those registered with different authentication servers. Global cross-realm authentication is supported by several authentication systems <ref> [10, 12] </ref>, and techniques for assessing confidence in foreign authentication servers has been discussed widely in the literature [1, 3, 4]. Most approaches require a hierarchical organization of realms, with trust relationships following the hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: A surety bond also indemnifies the insured for any damages resulting from dishonest acts of the service provider. Unlike the coverage provided by liability insurance, these acts may be intentional or unintentional in nature. As a result, surety bonding provides greater coverage for clients than does liability insurance. <ref> [11] </ref> Due to the similarities between surety bonding and liability insurance, we will use the term insurance to encompass both for the remainder of the paper.
