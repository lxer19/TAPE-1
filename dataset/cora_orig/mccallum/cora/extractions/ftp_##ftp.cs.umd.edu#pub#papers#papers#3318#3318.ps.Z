Abstract: When we regard the plane as a set of points, we can define various geometric properties of subsets of the plane|connectedness, convexity, area, diameter, etc. It is well known that the plane can also be regarded as a set of lines. This note considers methods of defining sets (or fuzzy sets) of lines in the plane, and of defining (analogs of) "geometric properties" for The support of the Air Force Office of Scientific Research under Grant F49620-93-1-0039 is gratefully acknowledged, as is the help of Sandy German in preparing this paper. such sets.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction When we regard the plane as a set of points, we can define various geometric properties of subsets of the plane|connectedness, convexity, area, diameter, etc.; for a review of geometric properties that are of interest in image analysis and computer vision, see <ref> [1] </ref>. Most of these properties can be generalized to fuzzy subsets of the plane; for reviews of the literature on fuzzy geometry see [2, 3]. The plane can also be regarded as a set of lines; this "dual" viewpoint plays an important role in projective geometry [4]. <p> This allows us to define fuzzy connectedness, fuzzy convexity, etc. for fuzzy sets of lines; we recall <ref> [1] </ref> that a fuzzy set is fuzzy connected (convex) iff its level sets are all connected (convex), so that the results in Sections 2.2-3 can be used to characterize fuzzy connectedness (convexity) for fuzzy sets of lines.

In the computer vision literature, such a parameter space is called a "Hough space" <ref> [4] </ref>. Sets of lines thus correspond to subsets of Hough space.

Reference-contexts: Section 2 discusses how to define the line parameter space so that the correspondence between points in the parameter space and lines in the plane is one-to-one and continuous. (A parameterization of this type was first introduced in <ref> [6] </ref>.) It also shows that because of the nature of this correspondence, various basic geometric properties are not as "well behaved" for sets of lines as they are for sets of points, (and similarly for fuzzy sets of lines). <p> In the rest of this section we shall assume that our Hough space is the Mobius-strip (; p) space defined in this way. (For further discussion of the Mobius Hough space, see <ref> [6] </ref>.) [A one-to-one continuous mapping can also be constructed by defining modulo 2 for p &gt; 0 and modulo for p = 0, as suggested earlier in this section.

Reference-contexts: In the axiomatic foundations of geometry <ref> [7] </ref>, "incidence axioms" are used to establish relationships between sets of points and sets of lines. Section 3 considers sets of lines that satisfy incidence relations with given sets of points, and defines their geometric properties in terms of properties of these sets of points. <p> Similarly, it allows us to define "metric" properties of fuzzy sets of lines; for example, the area of a fuzzy set is the integral of its membership function. 3 Sets of lines that meet sets of points 3.1 Sets of lines defined by incidence Hilbert's incidence axioms <ref> [7] </ref> for sets of points and lines in the plane require that for any two points in the set of points, the line joining them is in the set of lines. <p> Since a set of points is fuzzy connected (or convex) iff its level sets fP j (P ) t for some 0 t 1g are connected (or convex), it is straightforward to generalize the results in Section 3.1 to the fuzzy case. 3.4 Duality The incidence axioms <ref> [7] </ref> also require that if two lines are in the set of lines, their point of intersection (if it exists) is in the set of points.
