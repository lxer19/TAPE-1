Abstract: We propose and analyze several strategies for performing timestamping of an MPEG-2 Transport Stream transmitted over a packet-switched network using the PCR-unaware encapsulation scheme, and analyze their effect on the quality of the recovered clock at the MPEG-2 Systems decoder. When the timestamping scheme is based on a timer with a fixed period, the PCR values in the packet stream may switch polarity deterministically, at a frequency determined by the timer period and the transport rate of the MPEG signal. This, in turn, can degrade the quality of the recovered clock at the receiver beyond acceptable limits. We consider three timestamping schemes for solving this problem: (i) selecting the deterministic timer period to avoid the phase difference in PCR values altogether, (ii) fine-tuning the deterministic timer period to maximize the frequency of PCR polarity changes, and (iii) selecting the timer period randomly to eliminate the deterministic PCR polarity changes. For the case of deterministic timer period, we derive the frequency of the PCR polarity changes as a function of the timer period and the transport rate, and use it to find ranges of the timer period for acceptable quality of the recovered clock. We also analyze a random timestamping procedure based on a random telegraph process and obtain lower bounds on the rate of PCR polarity changes such that the recovered clock does not violate the PAL/NTSC clock specifications. The analytical results are verified by simulations with both synthetic and actual MPEG-2 Transport Streams sent to an MPEG-2 Systems decoder.

Reference-contexts: The PCR-unaware scheme is the recommended method of AAL encapsulation in the ATM Forum Video on Demand specification [19]. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature <ref> [1, 7, 8, 10, 18, 21] </ref> for the design of the MPEG-2 decoder to reduce the effects of jitter and provide acceptable quality for the decoded program. However, the impact of the timestamping process on the clock recovery at the decoder is not well understood. <p> However, the impact of the timestamping process on the clock recovery at the decoder is not well understood. Insight on a few aspects of the timestamping process with a fixed-period timer, when transporting MPEG-2 over AAL5 using the PCR-unaware packing scheme, was first given by Akyildiz et al. <ref> [1] </ref>. In that work, it was shown that transport packets containing PCR values may switch indices (between odd and even) in a deterministic manner with a period that depends on both the transport rate and the timer period. <p> Our results show that, for certain ranges of timer periods, the low frequency of the pattern switch results in unacceptable quality of the reconstructed clock. This contradicts with the hypothesis of Akyildiz et al. <ref> [1] </ref>, which states that reducing the frequency of the deterministic pattern switch improves the quality of the recovered clock. For deterministic timer periods, fine-tuning the timer to maximize the frequency of pattern switch results in the best quality of the receiver clock. <p> Deterministic Case When a timer with a constant period is used at the source to timestamp the MPEG-2 packet stream, the positions of the PCR values switch between even and odd boundaries in the AAL packets at a constant frequency. This effect was first observed by Akyildiz et al. <ref> [1] </ref>, who termed it "pattern switch". In this section, we systematically derive the pattern switch frequency as a function of the timer period and the transport rate of the MPEG stream.

Reference-contexts: Although the two methods are not equivalent, the convergence time and the steady-state error of the receiver PLL are almost the same in both cases <ref> [2] </ref>. For the sake of convenience, we chose the second method to model jitter. In our experiments, the jitter is added directly to the incoming PCR values at the decoder, in terms of the number of ticks of a 27 MHz clock.

Reference-contexts: Since, according to MPEG-2 standard <ref> [9] </ref>, the maximum jitter expected is around 0:5 ms, the maximum allowable difference is 13500 ticks. For this maximum difference, the decoder must operate at a frequency within the limits specified in the MPEG-2 standard. <p> Finally, a third alternative is to use a random timestamping interval to avoid the deterministic pattern switch behavior. In this section, we discuss the tradeoffs associated with each of these approaches: The MPEG standard <ref> [9] </ref> specifies a maximum interval of 0.1 seconds for transmission of times-tamps in the MPEG-2 transport stream. Therefore, in all the schemes we consider below, we assume that the timestamping interval T c is always chosen within this bound. <p> The PCR insertion frequency was varied based on the specific timestamping scheme simulated, with a lower bound of 10 Hz to meet the MPEG-2 specifications <ref> [9] </ref>. The transport rate was set to 4 Mbps, which results in an inter-packet time T p of 188 fl 8=(4 fi 10 6 ) = 376 seconds. Thus, the maximum packetization jitter under the PCR-unaware scheme is 376 s.

Next, we analyze a random timestamping procedure based on a random telegraph process <ref> [11] </ref> and obtain lower bounds on the rate of change of PCR polarity so that the recovered clock meets the PAL/NTSC specifications. <p> Without loss of generality, we can assume that they have the same probability of being in odd or even-indexed transport packets (as by using Bernoulli trials).

The objective of our analysis is to obtain the variance or the actual function that describes the recovered clock, i.e., f (t). We derive the variance of the recovered clock in the case that the sequence of f o =2r values forms a scaled random telegraph process.

The main difference in our analysis is in the nature of the input signal. In our case, the input signal is a linear function as shown in Figure 2.1, whereas in the case of traditional PLLs, the input signal is considered to be a 2.
