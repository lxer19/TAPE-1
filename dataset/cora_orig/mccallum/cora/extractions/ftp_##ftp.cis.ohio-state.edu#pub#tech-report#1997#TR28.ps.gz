Abstract: ATM Forum specifies public key cryptography to be the default ATM authentication mechanism and directory services like X.509 to be the infrastructure for public key distribution and certification. Authenticated signaling, widely acknowledged as a necessary security feature of ATM network, requires the signaling message to be authenticated with a digital signature signed by the private key of the calling party. To verify the digital signature, the called party needs to obtain the public key of the calling party and a proof of the calling party's ownership to that public key. In X.509, the standard form of such a proof is a chain of public key certificates, called the certificate path between two parties. Certificate exchange protocol (CEP), proposed by ATM Forum, requires that another bi-directional connection be established between two parties to exchange public keys and certificate paths before an authenticated connection can be set up, which is not an ideal approach. We propose an algorithm which is embedded into ATM routing protocols to generate a certificate path inside a signaling message on-the-fly as the signaling message travels through the ATM network. In this approach, all that a calling party needs to know for authentication purpose is its own public key certificate and the ATM network builds the rest of the certificate path for it. Related issues like distribution of public key certificates and optimization of CA hierarchy are also addressed in this paper.

Reference-contexts: Otherwise, the signaling message needs to be transported across the public network. Since our certificate path generation algorithm is closely related to P-NNI, we give an overview of it next. A detailed tutorial on this topic can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. Of course, the most complete and authoritative treatment of this subject is [5]. 2.2 An Overview of P-NNI 2.2.1 Hierarchical Structure P-NNI is a set of protocols used to route signaling messages in a private ATM network. <p> For scalability reasons, P-NNI adopts a hierarchical structure such that switches are organized into groups and a higher level group consists of groups one level below. Only aggregate topology and connectivity information of a group is exchanged with other groups at the same level in the hierarchy <ref> [1] </ref>. Fig. 2 shows an example of the hierarchical structure in a private ATM network. Viewed at level 1 (the part above the upper zoom line), the network N contains three high level groups (A, B and C), called logical nodes. <p> Logical nodes in a peer group exchange full connectivity and topology information with each other. A logical node in a peer group only floods aggregate topology and connectivity information inside itself to other group members <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> So the response time for an authenticated signaling is reduced at least by a factor of two. * Third, since all signaling messages are authenticated, we can enforce the security policy "all connections must be authenticated", which is useful in implementing the ATM firewalls <ref> [1] </ref>. 3.5 Authenticated Signaling across Public ATM Networks The certificate path generation algorithm (CGPA) we discussed in Section 3.2 works when both the calling and the called parties are in the same private ATM network. <p> In the following, we describe two possible approaches to route signaling message from ES1 to ES2 and discuss how to build a certificate path across the public network in both cases. The first approach is called permanent virtual path tunneling <ref> [1] </ref>. In this approach a permanent virtual path (PVP) is set up between N1 and N2, more specifically between I1 and I2, across the public network. <p> Therefore, all N1 and N2 need to do for authenticated interconnection is to let the root CAs certify each other when the PVP is set up. The other approach works if the public network supports switched virtual connection (SVC) through public UNI <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> is mapped to a public UNI signaling request at border switch S1 and the public ATM network will route this signaling request all the way to border switch S2, map it back to a P-NNI signaling request and route it to the switch that end system ES2 is attached to <ref> [1] </ref>. This approach is preferred since it allows more flexibility and ubiquitous communication needs. But up to now SVC signaling is not provided in public ATM networks because B-ICI between the carrier networks does not 13 support any control plane functions [6]. <p> When the signaling message is routed to I2, S2 will map it back to a signaling message destined for ES2. The public ATM network is expected to provide a directory service to enable S1 query the E.164 address of I2 according to the NSAP address of ES2 <ref> [1] </ref>. When a private network is connected to the public network, it registers its NSAP address with the public network and is given the E.164 of the public UNI it is attached to.

Reference-contexts: To establish a SVC, the calling party needs to send a signaling message SETUP to the called party. If the call can be accepted, the called party will send a signaling message CONNECT back to the calling party to confirm the connection <ref> [2] </ref>. To guard against threats like impersonation and spoofing, SETUP message should contain authentication information that the called party can use to verify the identity of the calling party. The same requirement applies to CONNECT message if mutual authentication is required. This problem is known as the authenticated signaling [14].

P-NNI adopts a modified link-state algorithm, in which P-NNI topology state packets (PTSP) that carry topology and connectivity information, are distributed throughout the network. <p> For example, A.2.3 is a border node at level 3 and A.3 is a border node at level 2. Such border nodes know that they have connections to other logical nodes and play an important role in routing <ref> [5] </ref>. Logical nodes in a peer group exchange full connectivity and topology information with each other. A logical node in a peer group only floods aggregate topology and connectivity information inside itself to other group members [1]. <p> For example, the topology and connectivity information node A.2.1 has about the network N is shown in Fig. 3. The details of the mechanism to exchange such kind of information are out of the scope of this paper and can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. Each peer group has a logical node that represents this peer group as a logical node in the parent peer group. This node is called a peer group leader (PGL).

Reference-contexts: This approach is preferred since it allows more flexibility and ubiquitous communication needs. But up to now SVC signaling is not provided in public ATM networks because B-ICI between the carrier networks does not 13 support any control plane functions <ref> [6] </ref>. However, since future version of B-ICI is expected to support SVC signaling across it, we assume that SVC support will be available soon [8]. Under this assumption, the alternative approach works as follows.

Reference-contexts: The calling party A.2.1.x signs the message using its private key, appends the signature and its public key certificate A:2:1 &lt;< A:2:1:x &gt;> to the signaling message, and then signals A.2.1 through UNI <ref> [7] </ref>. When A.2.1 receives the signaling message, it appends the certificate CA A:2 &lt;< A:2:1 &gt;> to the signaling message because the signaling message is about to leave the source switch. Then it sends the message to A.2.2.

E.164 addressing scheme was originally used in telephone networks and now used in public ATM networks.

A public key certificate contains the identity of the party, its public key, and some other information like its lifespan and serial number. It is signed by the private key of the CA so that no one can forge it. <p> Based on the way how these CAs are organized, some CAs issue certificates to other CAs. For example, in X.509, all the CAs are organized in a hierarchy such that a higher level CA issues certificates to CAs one level below <ref> [12] </ref>. When a node A wants to talk to a node B, 1 A needs to obtain B's public key certificate. If B's certificate is signed by a CA C whose public key is not known to A, A needs to obtain the certificate of C as well. <p> Here we briefly introduce the basic idea and notations used in X.509 to make our discussion later easier. In X.509, CAs (Certification Authority) are organized in a tree-like hierarchy and Fig. 4 is an example of such a hierarchy <ref> [12] </ref>. Each leaf node is a principal (e.g., end systems, users) whose public key is to be certified and each tree node is a CA. All the child nodes of a tree node register their public keys with the CA that the tree node corresponds to.

To overcome the drawbacks associated with CEP, we propose an algorithm, called Certificate Path Generation Algorithm (CPGA), that can be readily integrated into ATM routing protocols to generate a certificate path from the calling party to the called party on-the-fly as the signaling message travels through the network.
