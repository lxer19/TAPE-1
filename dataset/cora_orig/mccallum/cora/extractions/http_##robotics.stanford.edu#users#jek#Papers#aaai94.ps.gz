Abstract: In the design of systems of multiple agents, we must deal with the potential for conflict that is inherent in the interactions among agents; to ensure efficient operation, these interactions must be coordinated. We extend, in two related ways, an existing framework that allows behavioral conventions to emerge in agent societies. We first consider localizing agents, thus limiting their interactions. We then consider giving some agents authority over others by implementing asymmetric interactions. Our primary interest is to explore how locality and authority affect the emergence of conventions. Through computer simulations of agent societies of various configurations, we begin to develop an intuition about what features of a society promote or inhibit the spontaneous generation of coordinating conventions.

Reference-contexts: While our model incorporates adaptive agents that learn purely from experience, many researchers have taken the view that agents should be treated as "rational" in the game-theoretic sense, choosing their actions based on some expected outcome ((Stary 1993) is an overview of these approaches). In <ref> (Glance & Huberman 1993) </ref>, Glance and Huberman approach closest to our work, exploring the effects of a dynamic social structure on cooperation between agents.

Reference-contexts: Our notion of locality differs because it is not based on an expectation of interaction: it is based on the actual occurrence or non-occurrence of interactions. This research bears a close resemblence to work in economics and game theory <ref> (Kandori, Mailath, & Rob 1993) </ref>. One of our current goals is to gain a better understanding of this relationship.

One of our current goals is to gain a better understanding of this relationship. More generally, research on adaptive multi-agent systems appears to have ties to work in artificial life <ref> (Lindgren 1992) </ref>, population genetics (Mettler, Gregg, & Schaffer 1988), and quantitative sociology (Weidlich & Haag 1983). However, while systems from these diverse fields share characteristics such as distributed components and complex dynamics, their particulars remain unreconciled.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that it is possible for an agent society to reach a convention without any centralized control if agents interact and learn from their experiences <ref> (Shoham & Tennenholtz 1992a) </ref>. <p> Conventions thus achieved have been called "emergent conventions", and the process for reaching them has been dubbed "co-learning."(Shoham & Tennenholtz 1993) In previous work on the emergence of conventions through co-learning, it was assumed that each agent in a society is equally likely to interact with any other agent <ref> (Shoham & Tennenholtz 1992a) </ref>. This seems an unreasonable assumption in the general case, and we consider ways to extend the framework by allowing for non-uniform interaction probabilities.

Reference-contexts: In general, designing all necessary conventions into a system or developing a centralized control mechanism to legislate new conventions is a difficult and perhaps intractable task <ref> (Shoham & Tennenholtz 1992b) </ref>. It has been shown that it is possible for an agent society to reach a convention without any centralized control if agents interact and learn from their experiences (Shoham & Tennenholtz 1992a).

Reference-contexts: For our preliminary investigations, we have chosen to use a learning rule similar to the Highest Cumulative Reward rule used by Shoham and Tennen-holtz <ref> (Shoham & Tennenholtz 1993) </ref>. To decide which strategy it will use, an agent first computes the cumulative reward for each strategy by summing the feedback from all interactions in which it used that strategy and then chooses the strategy with the highest cumulative reward (HCR).

Reference-contexts: There are, of course, many other possible learning rules agents could use, including more sophisticated reinforcement learning techniques such as Q-learning <ref> (Watkins 1989) </ref>; however, using the simpler HCR rule fits with our program of starting with a simpler system.
