Abstract: A method to add a Web-based interface to a command-line driven system is presented. Javamatic generates a graphical user interface, then invokes commands in the legacy system transparently to the user. The user interface is generated from a high level description of the application, which is UI independent, combined with a set of UI mapping rules. The application is wrapped with an interface server; thus multiple clients can use the application through the Web. Examples are presented to show how Javamatic can rapidly construct a new interface and synthesize a new system from an existing system.

Novices and highly skilled programmers alike use such tools to increase productivity. All interface generation tools are faced with a tradeoff between giving designers control over an interface design and providing a high level of automation.
