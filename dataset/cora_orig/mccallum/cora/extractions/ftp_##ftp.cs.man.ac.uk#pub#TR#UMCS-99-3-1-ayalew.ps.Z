Abstract: In this work a new technique for minimising jerk during longitudinal manoeuvre of a wheeled mobile robot traversing fixed road obstacles, which have positive gradient geometry, is presented. The dynamics of the robot with respect to the longitudinal, pitching and vertical motions of the platform are considered. The work has demonstrated that by controlling the drive torque input to the wheels, the platform can move over a positive-gradient hump with minimal jerk. This helps to minimise the possibility of wheel-ground contact loss, thus ensuring the stability of payload on wheeled mobile robots which are often used for transporting materials over uneven factory shop floors.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, it will be difficult to control the vehicle smoothly with a possible adverse impact on the stability of the payload on the platform. Some consideration has been given to vehicle behaviour while moving on uneven terrain with respect to path planning. Simon <ref> [4] </ref> considered the stability of a mobile platform as deemed to be satisfactory, when the line of action of the force of gravity on the vehicle intersected the polygon prescribed by the wheel contact points.

Report number UMCS-99-3-1. http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/cstechrep/titles99.html A highly simplified dynamics model has been presented by Shiller et al. <ref> [7] </ref> for vehicles travelling on uneven terrain. In this model a vehicle is reduced to a point mass so that the inertia effects can be ignored.
