Abstract: We present a system for automatic 2D analysis of the tongue movement from digital ultrasound image sequences. The system focuses on extraction, tracking and analysis of the tongue surface during speech production and swallowing. The input to the system is provided by a Head and Transducer Support System (HATS), which is developed for use in ultrasound imaging of tongue movement. We developed a novel active contour (snakes) model that uses several adjacent images during the extraction of the tongue surface contour for an image frame. The user supplies an initial contour model for a single image frame in the sequence. This initial contour is a form of expert knowledge input to the system, which is used to find the candidate contour points in the adjacent images. Subsequently, the new snake mechanism is applied to estimate optimal contours for each image frame using these candidate points. Finally, the system uses a postprocessing method to refine the positions of the contours by utilizing more spatiotemporal information. We extended our previous work by applying the system to different speech and swallowing sequences using various constraints. The extended system can also extract qualitative local deformations with only a minimal computational overhead, which may be useful for the diagnosis of Cerebellar Ataxic disorder. We tested the system on several different speech and swallowing sequences produced by HATS. During the tests, we saw that the system is flexible enough to be used in a wide variety of cases. In addition, visual inspection of the detected contours by the speech experts confirms that the results are very promising and this system can be effectively employed in speech and swallowing research.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, a system to analyze ultrasound tongue images should be very flexible in order to take advantage of speech expert input. This extension of our previous work <ref> [1] </ref> was developed to consider this requirement. We were able to analyze tongue movement during swallowing by taking advantage of the flexibility of our system. 2. <p> This method takes advantage of locality nature of the energy calculations to achieve an exhaustive minimization in polynomial time. We modified this method such a way that only a useful subset of intensity points are fed to the minimization process <ref> [1] </ref>. With this method, in addition to the reduction in the computation time, it is possible to impose additional constraints on the relations between the snake elements. <p> This type of analysis can be helpful to diagnose Cerebellar Ataxia disorder. During our experiments, we found that our system can handle a wide variety of speech sequences if the initial model is properly chosen. Our current system extends the basic model presented in <ref> [1] </ref> in order to be able to apply different angular constraints for different tongue movement types. One such movement type is the tongue movement during swallowing. In speech, the tongue surface touches to the top of mount only at a point. <p> Conclusions We presented a system for automatic analysis of 2D contours of the tongue surfaces from digital ultrasound image sequences produced by HATS. This work extends our previous work <ref> [1] </ref> by applying the system to different speech and swallowing sequences. The enhancements include the addition of angle range constraints for swallowing sequences, qualitative analysis of local deformations to detect special speech disorders, and increased flexibility of the system.

Reference-contexts: Our method of extracting local deformations can be compared to matching strategies that defines a number of constraints between the contours segments and uses a minimization to find the optimal match <ref> [3] </ref>. In our method, the contour patches between the snake elements are analogous to contour segments. The only restriction in the segment matching is the similarity energy unlike Geiger et. al.[3], which has a number of constraints with parameters to fit the requirements of the problem.

Reference-contexts: Notice that if the weight of similarity energy term is zero, both of the snakes are guaranteed to find the same position as long as they have a common subset of candidate points. Our usage of multiple snakes was motivated by the dual-snake approach proposed by Gunn and Nixon <ref> [4] </ref>, which uses closed snakes unlike our open-ended snakes. In their method, one snake expands from the inside of the region of interest and one snake contracts from the outside.

Reference-contexts: As a result, standard ways of detecting edges do not work for this problem, and hence specific processing methods should be developed. Our system uses a deformable model based on active contour models <ref> [5] </ref> as the main tool for detecting the contour of the tongue surface. Considering the problems listed above, snakes are attractive. First, snakes facilitate initial contours, so that an initial contour model can be given to the system by the user. <p> Later, we will explain how this model is used to process a complete sequence of ultrasound images. 2.1. Formulation for a single frame Our formulation of active contour models is based on the discrete version of the original formulation <ref> [5] </ref> with some modifications. A snake is an ordered set of points V = [v 1 ; v 2 ; :::; v n ] with a snake energy value calculated using internal and external forces. <p> E smo (v i ) is analogous to the smoothness term in the original snake formulation <ref> [5] </ref>. It is estimated as E smo (v i ) = 1 cos i , where i = 2 : : : (n 1) and i is the angle between ! ! v i v i+1 . <p> If it is used as the only internal energy term, this smooth-ness term suffers from some of the problems with the original smoothness constraints <ref> [5] </ref>. For example, it tends to shrink around strong edge points because closer the snake element positions on a contour, smaller the value of .

Reference-contexts: Our system is very flexible in order to take advantage of speech expert input. The system needs only one initial contour model for the entire image sequence. Although in the literature there are some systems extracting 2D tongue surface contours <ref> [7, 9] </ref>, to the best of our knowledge, our system is the first one to automatically extract surfaces for a complete ultrasound speech sequence. The system can produce qualitative local deformations as a side effect of the minimization process.

Reference-contexts: Alternative methods are either too slow to record movement, such as MRI, or they expose subjects to radiation, like X-rays. In order to automatically extract and detect the tongue surface from an image sequence, we developed a system that uses ultrasound images of the tongue produced by HATS <ref> [8] </ref>. Although HATS solved several difficulties in taking reliable and accurate ultrasound tongue images, there are problems that should still be addressed (Figure 1). Some of these problems are unique to the ultrasound imaging and the imaging of the tongue movement. First, the ultrasound images are quite noisy. <p> First, the ultrasound images are quite noisy. Second, structures within the tongue (tendons, blood vessels) and noise echo artifacts cause high contrast edges unrelated to the structure of interest. In addition, the ultrasound transducer of HATS <ref> [8] </ref> emits a beam upward from the chin. During the production of some speech sounds, portions of the tongue may be almost parallel to the ultrasound waves. Therefore, the edge corresponding to the surface of interest can be interrupted in places where the tongue does not reflect the waves.
