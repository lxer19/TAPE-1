Abstract: Large scale engineering projects are created by teams of cooperating engineers who must share knowledge about the project as it evolves. Sharing of engineering knowledge is actually made more difficult by modern engineering environments. First, the computerized engineering environment requires that much of the knowledge sharing be on a tool-to-tool basis, rather than human-to-human. Computer tools (3-D modelers, analysis and simulation tools, etc.) have become the locus of much of the engineering information for a project. These tools embody engineering assumptions and methods that are not understood in detail by their user engineers. Moreover, the tools use specialized internal representations that are not understood by other tools. Second, the connectivity enabled by the modern networked engineering environment greatly increase the complexity of the interaction environment. It is virtually impossible for engineers to know who is likely to be impacted by their decisions, and what issues they need to negotiate. The Cosmos project is part of a collection of research efforts that is creating technology to allow engineers to share knowledge about a design through their tools: when engineers modify a design, the tools they are using automatically provide relevant updates to other engineers whose work is affected by the change. Cosmos's role is to support engineering negotiation, illustrated here in the domain of active control of spaceborne structures. The paper describes the Cosmos Phase I implementation, which provides negotiation support for engineers from different disciplines cooperating on a design; lessons learned from Phase I, and our current activities in building the Phase II implementation.

Reference-contexts: Cosmos assesses the impact of a proposed change via qualitative simulation <ref> [Forbus] </ref> on the commitment relationships that include the changed element. For example, engineers may want to determine whether a change in gimbal mass will cause the stress on a strut to exceed the maximum acceptable stress. In general, Cosmos will not have enough detail to calculate the stress directly.

Reference-contexts: This knowledge is much more than a dictionary; it is a knowledge structure or ontology <ref> [Gruber] </ref> that defines the key objects and actions in the domain, and the key relationships among them. <p> For example, the engineering math ontology "units-and-dimensions", developed under the SHADE project [SHADE], is a likely candidate. Cosmos Phase II will in fact be a good test of the adequacy of the evolving technology of "portable ontologies" (see <ref> [Gruber] </ref>). We also plan to improve the scope of impact visualizations that are presented to engineers. The current visualization presents a tree of commitments with each leaf node itself potentially being expandable into a sub-tree.

Cosmos Overview The Cosmos work was motivated by our experience in implementing a demonstration of the knowledge level integration technology as part of PACT (Palo Alto Collaborative Testbed) <ref> [PACT] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A few research efforts are beginning to create automated information flow support technology by incorporating "coordination models" into the environment (e.g., <ref> [Petrie] </ref>). That is, interactions among participants are guided by a built-in model that provides a priori structuring of the interaction process based on theories of how engineering interaction works or should work.

Reference-contexts: A collection of research efforts <ref> [PACT, SHADE, SHARE] </ref> is creating computational infrastructure technology to allow engineers to share information at the knowledge level: the environment provides a shared knowledge base and mechanisms for managing information flow in terms of that knowledge base. <p> Tools exchange information through their wrappers in terms of KIF/KQML messages. These messages are automatically routed to the tools of other engineers that have declared interest in the kind of information found in the content part of the message (see <ref> [SHADE] </ref>). 10 Cosmos is also part of the infrastructure, acting as a mediator [Wiederhold] for determining information that tools should be interested in, beyond the interests they have declared 1 . <p> Cosmos and the content-based router determine the stake holders automatically: the scope of impact shows which MACE elements are affected by the change, and the content-based router knows the interests of the various MACE engineers (based on previously collected subscription information, see <ref> [SHADE] </ref>). Cosmos therefore send the proposed change, in context, to all of the stake holders. Together this information is used to make sure that all of the affected engineers receive the proposed change and the relevant scope of impact pages. <p> For Phase I, we collaborated minimally with ontology researchers to develop an ontology of MACE concepts and their interrelationships. For Phase II, we will be exploiting other engineering ontologies to a greater extent. For example, the engineering math ontology "units-and-dimensions", developed under the SHADE project <ref> [SHADE] </ref>, is a likely candidate. Cosmos Phase II will in fact be a good test of the adequacy of the evolving technology of "portable ontologies" (see [Gruber]). We also plan to improve the scope of impact visualizations that are presented to engineers.
