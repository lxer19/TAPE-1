Title: (page 1) Dynamic Huffman Coding  
Author: Jeffrey Scott Vitter ; 
Abstract: We present a Pascal implementation of the one-pass algorithm for constructing dynamic Huffman codes that is described and analyzed in a companion paper [Vitter, 1987]. The program runs in real time; that is, the processing time for each letter of the message is proportional to the length of its codeword. The number of bits used to encode a message of t letters is less than t bits more than that used by the well-known two-pass algorithm. This is best possible for any one-pass Huffman scheme. In practice it uses fewer bits than all other Huffman schemes. The algorithm has applications in file compression and network transmission.
