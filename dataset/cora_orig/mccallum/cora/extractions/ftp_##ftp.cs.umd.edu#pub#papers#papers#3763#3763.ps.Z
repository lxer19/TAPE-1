Abstract: Verbal and compositional lexical aspect provide the underlying temporal structure of events. Knowledge of lexical aspect, e.g., (a)telicity, is therefore required for interpreting event sequences in discourse (Dowty, 1986; Moens and Steedman, 1988; Passoneau, 1988), interfacing to temporal databases (Androutsopoulos, 1996), processing temporal modifiers (Antonisse, 1994), describing allowable alternations and their semantic effects (Resnik, 1996; Tenny, 1994), and selecting tense and lexical items for natural language generation ((Dorr and Olsen, 1996; Klavans and Chodorow, 1992), cf. (Slobin and Bocaz, 1988)). We show that it is possible to represent lexical aspect|both verbal and compositional|on a large scale, using Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) representations of verbs in the classes cataloged by Levin (1993). We show how proper consideration of these universal pieces of verb meaning may be used to refine lexical representations and derive a range of meanings from combinations of LCS representations. A single algorithm may therefore be used to determine lexical aspect classes and features at both verbal and sentence levels. Finally, we illustrate how knowledge of lexical aspect facilitates the interpretation of events in NLP applications. fl This work was supported, in part, by Department of Defense contract MDA90496C1250, Army Research Office contract DAAL03-91-C-0034 through Battelle Corporation, NSF NYI IRI-9357731 and Logos Corporation, NSF CNRS INT-9314583, Advanced Research Projects Agency and ONR contract N00014-92-J-1929, Alfred P.

Reference-contexts: Grammatical aspect takes these situation types and presents them as imperfective (John was winning the race/loving his job) or perfective (John had won/loved his job). Verbs are assigned to lexical aspect classes, as in Table 1 (cf. <ref> (Brinton, 1988) </ref>[p. 57], (Smith, 1991)) based on their behavior in a variety of syntactic and semantic frames that focus on their features. 1 A major source of the difficulty in assigning lexical aspect features to verbs is the ability of verbs to appear in sentences denoting situations of multiple aspectual types.

Reference-contexts: Since the verb classes (state, activity, etc.) are abstractions over feature combinations, we now discuss each feature in turn. 4.1 Dynamicity The feature [+dynamic] encodes the distinction between events ([+dynamic]) and states ([;dynamic]). Arguably "the most salient distinction" in an aspect taxonomy <ref> (Dahl, 1985, p. 28) </ref>, in the LCS dynamicity is encoded at the topmost level.

Reference-contexts: This project on representing aspectual structure builds on previous work, in which verbs were grouped automatically into Levin's semantic classes (Dorr and Jones, 1996; Dorr, To appear) and assigned LCS templates from a database built as Lisp-like structures <ref> (Dorr, 1997) </ref>. The assignment of aspectual features to the classes in Levin was done by hand inspection of the semantic effect of the alternations described in Part I of Levin (Olsen, 1996), with automatic coindexing to the verb classes (see (Dorr and Olsen, 1996)).
