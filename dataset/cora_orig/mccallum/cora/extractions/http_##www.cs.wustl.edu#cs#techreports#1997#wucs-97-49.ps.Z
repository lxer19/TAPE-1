Abstract: This report summarizes the results of an architectural study on Terabit Burst Switching. The purpose of this study was to explore alternative architectures for very high performance switching for data communication, using a combination of optical and electronic technologies. We explore two alternative implementations of the burst switching concept in detail, one using a hybrid architecture with an electronic core, and an integrated architecture using an all optical data path. We also briefly discuss an approach using optical TDM. Our results show that using the hybrid architecture, it is feasible to construct systems with aggregate capacities of tens of terabits per second and that efficiently support highly dynamic data communication applications with individual channel rates of 10 Gb/s. The integrated architectures allow greater scalability and superior performance, but their viability rests on the development of inexpensive optical wavelength conversion devices. Appropriate devices could be available in five to ten years.

Reference-contexts: Optical Space Switch Technologies Optical space switches are a key component of any burst switch architecture that maintains the data in optical format throughout <ref> [5] </ref>. There are two principal options for optical space switching. One is based on lithium niobate electro-optic directional couplers. This is fairly mature technology and switches as large as 8 fi 8 have been developed.

Reference-contexts: SOAs or some similar optical gating components are needed to select which delays a given signal passes through. The selection of a given input timeslot can be done using a Terabit Optical Asymmetric Delay (TOAD) device <ref> [9] </ref>. Jonathan Turner 15 4. System Design Using WDM Links and Electronic Switch ing There is a variety of possible approaches for implementing a terabit burst switch. In this section we consider a system using WDM links and electronic switching.

Reference-contexts: Vitesse also provides a 64 fi 64 crossbar supporting data rates of 200 Mb/s. Using byte wide data paths, this device could support burst switching at individual channel rates of over 1 Gb/s. 3.3. Wavelength Conversion Burst switches using WDM require wavelength conversion <ref> [10] </ref> devices. There are two main categories: fixed converters convert from a single fixed input wavelength to a single fixed Jonathan Turner 14 output wavelength and tunable converters allow either the input wavelength or the output wavelength to be variable. For some burst switch architectures, fixed converters are sufficient.

Reference-contexts: For a burst with fanout f , we estimate that the time to perform the setup will increase by (f 1)=4 times the ATM switch's basic cell processing time (about 130 ns in the system of reference <ref> [12] </ref>). Thus, the added latency for a connection with fanout 16 is under 2 s. <p> The entire reference system can be built using 30 trunk interface modules, 32 line interface modules, 2 burst store modules and 128 network boards. This is a total of 384 circuit boards, which can be packaged in five standard equipment racks. If the ATM switch of <ref> [12] </ref> is used and is configured for 512 links, it requires an additional five equipment racks. <p> The overall estimated system cost ranges from about $1.7 million to $13.4 million, depending on the assumed component costs, yielding a cost per Gb/s of between $46 and $362. For comparison, the system of <ref> [12] </ref> can be implemented for approximately $350 per Gb/s of capacity, using 1.2 Gb/s links. 3 So, even under fairly pessimistic component cost assumptions, the system can provide competitive cost/performance, as well as high end performance and total capacity. <p> Using the low cost estimates, the reference system is about a factor of seven better than the system of <ref> [12] </ref>. It is also interesting to note how the crossbar and fanin/fanout chips dominate the overall component count and consequently contribute significantly to the overall cost. <p> For multicasts with larger fanouts however, the amount of information needed to specify the output port set can become too large. Large fanouts can be handled effectively using a burst recycling technique, similar to the cell recycling technique used for multicast in <ref> [12] </ref>. To implement burst recycling, a subset of the system's output links are connected back to the corresponding input links. Multicast bursts are forwarded to their ultimate outputs through a multicast forwarding tree implemented using multiple passes through the switching network.

Reference-contexts: In addition, Rockwell has produced 16 fi 16 crossbar chips capable of operating at 10 Gb/s. Devices with this level of integration are required for practical WDM burst systems based on hybrid architectures. Lower speed components are available commercially from Vitesse <ref> [13] </ref>. In particular, they provide a four channel Fiber Channel transmitter and receiver array that operates at 1 Gb/s and implements a 5/4 line code and full clock recovery. It provides an eight bit interface on each of the four channels, allowing lower speed circuits to interface to it directly.
