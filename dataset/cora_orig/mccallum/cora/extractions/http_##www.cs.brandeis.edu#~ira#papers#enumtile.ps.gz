Title: ENUMERATION OF TILINGS OF DIAMONDS AND HEXAGONS WITH DEFECTS  
Author: HARALD HELFGOTT AND IRA M. GESSEL 
Abstract: We show how to count tilings of Aztec diamonds and hexagons with defects using determinants. In several cases these determinants can be evaluated in closed form. In particular, we obtain solutions to open problems 1, 2, and 10 in James Propp's list of problems on enumeration of matchings [21].

The sum in Lemma 16 is a partial sum of a special case of Dougall's very-well-poised 5 F 4 (1) sum <ref> [4, p. 25, eq. (3)] </ref>: if the upper limit of summation were 2n 1 instead of n 1, we would have a special case of Dougall's theorem.

In a (2n 1; 2n; 2n 1) or (2n; 2n 1; 2n) hexagon, the two central triangles are covered by a lozenge in exactly one-third of the tilings. Proof.

Reference-contexts: We can summarize our approach as follows: 1. Find the number of tilings of half of a hexagon or half of a diamond, with dents at given places. This is not new: see <ref> [6] </ref> and [7]. 2. Express the number of tilings of the figure as a whole as a sum of squares of the expressions obtained in the first step. The sum's range depends on the "defects" (missing triangles or squares, fixed lozenges or dominos) given in the problem. 3. <p> Next we prove two known results. First, we have a closed expression for the number of tilings of semi-hexagons with given dents, first stated in this form in <ref> [6] </ref>. This is equivalent to a well-known result on the enumeration of Gelfand patterns, as noted in [6], or on column-strict plane partitions.

Lemma 2. <p> By Proposition 4 and Lemma 5, the number of tilings of a (k; q; k) hexagon is 1 k1 fi i+j fi fi 0 The result then follows from Lemma 11. It is also possible, as shown in <ref> [6] </ref>, to derive the formula for the number of tilings of an (a; b; c) hexagon directly from Lemma 2. Next we prove a general theorem on Hankel determinants that allows us to evaluate the determinants in Lemma 10. Proposition 13.
