Abstract: Vision is generally assumed to begin by computing retinotopic maps of a set of low-level features such as color, orientation, and depth. Visual search [ Treisman and Gelade, 1980 ] is the problem of locating objects in the image that possess specified sets of low-level features. Segmentation is the problem of grouping together image pixels having similar low-level features. Tracking is the problem of following the motion and/or deformation of specific task-relevant objects over long time sequences. These problems have generally been considered in isolation from one another. In this paper we argue that these problems are in fact mutually constraining and should be properly considered together. We present a novel technique, based on iterative clustering, that simultaneously solves all three problems in a natural fashion. Although we do not claim to have solved any of these problems once and for all, our technique does have a number of interesting technical features: it can handle deforming objects; it runs in real time on low cost hardware; and it can be naturally implemented in parallel, retinotopic hardware. Such an implementation can be expected to have better convergence properties than current neurological models of visual attention. Content Areas: Vision, Robotics, Real-time Systems. Word Count: 4278. Tracking Number: A622. This paper has not been submitted elsewhere.

Reference-contexts: An object's silhouette can therefore be expected to be the union of some set of low-level regions. A number of segmentation techniques have been explored in the literature (see <ref> [ Ballard and Brown, 1982 ] </ref> for a survey). The simplest techniques are based on thresholding. The threshold is often computed by searching for peaks and valleys in a histogram of grey- or color-values. Connected-component analysis is the simplest technique that takes spatial information into account.

Reference-contexts: More recently, deformable tem 3 plates have become popular as both a segmentation technology [ Kass et al., 1987 ][ Radeva et al., 1995 ] and a tracking technology <ref> [ Blake et al., 1993 ] </ref>[ Bas-cle and Deriche, 1995 ] . 1.2 Tracking With the recent emphasis on active vision, tracking has received a great deal of attention. As with segmentation, we can usefully break the approaches into high- and low-level systems.

Reference-contexts: A histogram of flow-values is computed and a threshold is determined for distinguishing background from foreground. It appears to require that flow histograms be bi-modal, and so may have difficulty with odd motions such as rotation at constant depth. Brown et al. <ref> [ Brown et al., 1992 ] </ref> describe a system that tracks objects that are segmented using a zero-disparity filter. A number of authors have tracked feature points to control visual servoing systems [ Hager, 1995 ][ Fairley et al., 1995 ] .

Reference-contexts: Chapman popularized Ullman's theory (the "visual routine processor" theory) by embedding a simulation of the processor in a program that played a video game <ref> [ Chapman, 1990 ] </ref> . Since Chapman's work, a number of researchers have assumed or simulated very similar systems [ Reece and Shafer, 1991 ][ Kanazawa, 1994 ][ Whitehead and Ballard, 1990 ] and recently, Horswill [ Horswill, 1995 ] has produced a working implementation. <p> This implements the equivalent of the human "pop-up" capability: the ability to non-deterministically choose a single region satisfying a given low-level predicate. More complicated searches can be performed by implementing the standard enumerate-and-filter control structure. This could be implemented using a return-inhibition map <ref> [ Chapman, 1990 ] </ref> to hold the silhouettes of the regions that have already been considered. The description predicate for the region to be searched for would then be modified to reject pixels in the return-inhibition map. <p> It also generates additional data such as size and silhouette information, which techniques such as template matching cannot provide. The technique provides a plug-compatible replacement for the segmentation components of other low-level visual search systems such as <ref> [ Chapman, 1990 ] </ref>[ Horswill, 1995 ][ Rimey, 1992 ][ Wixson, 1992 ] allowing them not only to find regions with specified properties, but also to track. Much work remains to be done.

Reference-contexts: An image is then a cloud of points in this space and segments (homogeneous image regions) should, intuitively, correspond to clusters within this space. Standard unsupervised learning mechanisms (see <ref> [ Duda and Hart, 1973 ] </ref> for a survey), such as k-means clustering, can be used to find clusters given a priori knowledge of their statistical properties. <p> This assumes that the feature values are statistically independent, i.e. that their covariance matrix is diagonal. The assumption is unnecessary, but clustering with non-independent features requires computing and inverting the covariance matrices of the features for each cluster at each point in time, which is more expensive (see <ref> [ Duda and Hart, 1973 ] </ref> ). In practice, this system works well enough. A useful generalization would be to assume that the covariance matrix had block-diagonal form.

Reference-contexts: As with segmentation, we can usefully break the approaches into high- and low-level systems. Low-level systems run directly off of low level images features without building explicit object models. Template-based techniques <ref> [ Inoue, 1993 ] </ref> are simple, relatively cheap, make relatively few assumptions about objects and map well onto custom hardware. One of their advantages is that they make few assumptions about the nature of the objects they track.

Reference-contexts: Category (p) could be computing by placing a winner-take-all network at each pixel to compute the maximum of d i (p). The WTA networks would likely have much better convergence times than the networks in current neurological accounts of attention (see <ref> [ Tsotsos et al., 1994 ] </ref> for a survey) because each network individual need only ranger over clusters (&lt; 10 inputs), rather than over pixels (thousands to millions of inputs). 3 Advantages The technique has a number of useful properties. First of all, it is fast.
