Title: Modeling Multidimensional Databases

Abstract: We propose a data model and a few algebraic operations that provide semantic foundation to multidimensional databases. The distinguishing feature of the proposed model is the symmetric treatment not only of all dimensions but also measures. The model provides support for multiple hierarchies along each dimension and support for adhoc aggregates. The proposed operators are composable, reorderable, and closed in application. These operators are also minimal in the sense that none can be expressed in terms of others nor can any one be dropped without sacrificing functionality. They make possible the declarative specification and optimization of multidimensional database queries that are currently specified operationally. The operators have been designed to be translated to SQL and can be implemented either on top of a relational database system or within a special purpose multidimensional database engine. In effect, they provide an algebraic application programming interface (API) that allows the separation of the frontend from the backend. Finally, the proposed model provides a framework in which to study multidimensional databases and opens several new research problems.

Reference-contexts: Gray et al. [GBLP96] recently proposed an extension to SQL with a Data Cube operator that generalizes the groupby construct to support some of the multidimensional analysis. Since then, techniques have been developed for computing the data cube <ref> [AAD + 96] </ref>, for deciding what subset of a data cube to pre-compute [HRU96] [GHRU97], for estimating the size of multidimensional aggregates [SDNR96], and for indexing pre-computed summaries [SR96] [JS96]. The research in multidimensional indexing structures (see, for example, [Gut94] for an overview) is relevant as well.

Reference-contexts: We discuss in Section 4 some of our design choices and show how currently popular multidimensional database operations can be expressed in terms of the proposed operators. These operators have been designed to be translated into SQL, albeit with some minor extensions. We refer the reader to <ref> [AGS96] </ref> for these translations. Thus, our data model can be implemented on either a general-purpose relational system or a specialized engine. We conclude with a summary in Section 5. 2 Current State of the Art We begin with a brief overview of the current state of art in multidimensional databases. <p> It is by design. One of our goals was to explore how much of the functionality of current multidimensional products can be abstracted in terms of relational algebra. By developing operators that can be translated into SQL (see <ref> [AGS96] </ref> for translations), our hope was to create a fast path for providing OLAP capability on top of relational database systems. We must hasten to add that we are not arguing against specialized OLAP engineswe believe the design and prototyping of such engines is a fruitful research direction.

Reference-contexts: The database designer specifies all the aggregations they consider useful. While building the storage structure, these aggregations associated with all possible roll-ups are precomputed and stored. Thus, roll-ups and drill-downs are answered in interactive time. Many products have adopted this approach for instance, Arbor Essbase <ref> [Arb] </ref> and IRI Express [IRI]. Another approach uses a relational backend wherein operations on the data cube are translated to relational queries (posed in a possibly enhanced dialect of SQL). Indexes built on materialized views are heavily used in such systems.

Reference-contexts: However, the multi-dimensional indexing structures developed for spatial databases (see [Gut94]) may be useful in developing efficient implementations of OLAP databases. Statistical databases also address some of the same concerns as OLAP databases. However, models in the statistical database literature [Mic92] <ref> [CL94] </ref> have been primarily concerned with extending existing data models (mostly relational) for representing summaries and supporting operations for statistical data analysis. In contrast, our objective has been to develop a model and a set of basic operations that abstract the analysts view of enterprise data.

Reference-contexts: We chose to separately define merge because it is a unary operator unlike the binary join and also for performance reasons. 4 Discussion The reader may have noticed similarities in the operators proposed and relational algebra <ref> [Cod70] </ref>. It is by design. One of our goals was to explore how much of the functionality of current multidimensional products can be abstracted in terms of relational algebra. <p> elem function for combining two elements for the union step saves the value of C1's element if the two elements are different and makes the result 0 if they are identical 1 . 4.1 Expressive Power Our algebra can be seen to be at least as powerful as relational algebra <ref> [Cod70] </ref>. A precise circumscription of the expressive power of the proposed data model is an open problem. A related interesting open question pertains to defining a formal notion of completeness for multidimensional database queries and evaluating how complete our algebra is with respect to that metric.

Reference-contexts: However, since we treat measures and dimensions symmetrically, we have additional operators that are unique to our model.

The modeling efforts in spatial databases <ref> [Gut94] </ref> mostly concentrate on representing arbitrary geometric objects (points, lines, polygons, regions etc.) in multidimensional space. By viewing OLAP data as points in the multidimensional space of attributes, one could draw analogies between the two models. <p> But the operations central to spatial databases (overlap, containment, etc.) are quite different from the common OLAP operations (roll-up, drill-down, joins etc.). However, the multi-dimensional indexing structures developed for spatial databases (see <ref> [Gut94] </ref>) may be useful in developing efficient implementations of OLAP databases. Statistical databases also address some of the same concerns as OLAP databases.

Reference-contexts: Here the sales price of a product, besides being treated as a measure, is also the grouping attribute. Such queries that require categorizing on a measure are quite frequent. Non-uniform treatment of dimensions and measures makes such queries hard in current products. The proposed OLAP council API <ref> [OLA96] </ref> provides for all the measures to be put on one dimension of the cube. However, this proposal maintains a sharp distinction between measures and dimensions and does not solve the problem of being able to categorize on a measure. * Support for multiple hierarchies along each dimension.

Reference-contexts: Corresponding to a multidimensional query composed of several of these operators, we will get a sequence of SQL queries that offers opportunity for multi-query optimization. It needs to be investigated whether the known techniques (e.g. <ref> [SG90] </ref>) will suffice or do we need to develop new techniques. Similarly, there is opportunity for research in storage and access structures and materialized views.

This paper presents a framework for research in multidimensional databases. We first review concepts and terminologies in vogue in multidimensional database products in Section 2. We also point out some of the deficiencies in the current products. <p> Figure 1 illustrates this multidimensional view. 2.1 Terminology Determining attributes like product, date, supplier are referred to as dimensions while the determined at tributes like sales are referred to as measures. (Dimensions are called categorical attributes and measures are called numerical or summary attributes in the statistical database literature <ref> [Sho82] </ref>). There is no formal way of deciding which attributes should be made dimensions and which attributes should be made measures. It is left as a database design decision. Dimensions usually have associated with them hierarchies that specify aggregation levels and hence granularity of viewing data. <p> However, since we treat measures and dimensions symmetrically, we have additional operators that are unique to our model. Irrespective of these differences, OLAP databases will benefit from implementation techniques developed in statistical databases, particularly related to aggregation views (see <ref> [Sho82] </ref> [STL89]). Concurrent to our work, [GLS96] proposed a model for tabular data that embeds both the relational and the multidimensional data model. Their model also allows measures and dimensions to be interchanged like our model.
