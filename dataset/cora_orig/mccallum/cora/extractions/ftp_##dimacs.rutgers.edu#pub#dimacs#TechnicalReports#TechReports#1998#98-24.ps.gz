Reference-contexts: The problem may be complete for a class such as PSPACE that contains NP. Examples of such problems are given later in this chapter. Step 3. See whether your problem is already listed in a compendium of (NP-)complete problems. The book <ref> [ Garey and Johnson, 1988 ] </ref> lists several hundred NP-complete problems arranged by category. The following is intended as a small representative sample. The first five (together with 3SAT) receive extended treatment in [ Garey and Johnson, 1988 ] , while the last five receive comparable treatment here.

The first five (together with 3SAT) receive extended treatment in [ Garey and Johnson, 1988 ] , while the last five receive comparable treatment here.

(The polynomial-time algorithm for this case is nontrivial and was not discovered until 1978, as noted in <ref> [ Garey and Johnson, 1988 ] </ref> .) 20 However, one must also be careful in one's expectations. Suppose we alter the statement of Disjoint Connecting Paths by requiring also that no two vertices in two different paths may have an edge between them.

Reference-contexts: They are more common. Popular heuristic methods include genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, neural networks, relaxation to linear programming, and stochastic (Markov) process simulation. Experimental systems dedicated to certain NP-complete problems have recently yielded some interesting results|an extensive survey on solvers for Traveling Salesperson is given by <ref> [ Johnson and McGeogh, 1997 ] </ref> . There are two ways to attempt to use this research. One is to find a problem close to yours for which people have produced solvers, and try to carry over their methods and heuristics to the specific features of your problem.

Reference-contexts: A common misconception is that the above property of NP-complete languages is actually their definition, namely: if A 2 NP, and A 2 P implies P = NP, then A is NP-complete. This "definition" is wrong. A theorem due to Ladner <ref> [ Ladner, 1975b ] </ref> shows that P 6= NP if and only if there exists a language A 0 in NP P such that A 0 is not NP-complete.

Reference-contexts: Hence the circuit can run through every C j if and only if is satisfiable. Full details may be found in <ref> [ Papadimitriou, 1994 ] </ref> . For our last fully-worked-out example, we show a somewhat different pattern in which the individual variables as well as the clauses correspond to top-level components of the following problem.
