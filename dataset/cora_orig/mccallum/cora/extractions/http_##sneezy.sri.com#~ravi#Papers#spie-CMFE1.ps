Abstract: In this paper, we provide insight into the development of a new set of distortion-invariant texture operators. These "circular-Mellin" operators are invariant to both scale and orientation of the target and represent the spectral decomposition of the image scene in the log-polar coordinate system. Coupled with the shift invariance property of the correlator architecture, we show that these circular-Mellin operators can be used for rotation-, scale- and shift-invariant feature extraction. We also note that these feature extractors have a functional form that is similar to the Gabor transforms. Detailed analytical description of these operators and preliminary results are presented in this paper.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Segmentation of an image into regions that are homogenous with respect to a particular perceptual property is an important task in several image understanding applications, and thus has received considerable attention during the past two decades <ref> [1] </ref>. It is commonly observed that images of scenes are signals with a high degree of self-correlation.

Reference-contexts: The statistical approaches to texture analysis use the statistical descriptions to characterize the textures as smooth, coarse, grainy etc. The earlier approaches defined "homogenity" purely based on a single gray-level or first order characteristic. One of the striking contributions was from the research of Julesz <ref> [2] </ref>, who pointed out that the human (foveal) visual system is able to pre-attentively segregate textures that differ 1 in their mean or first-order statistics, and also those that differ in their dipole or second-order statistics, but in general cannot easily distinguish between texture fields that differ in their third- and

Reference-contexts: Of these second-order approaches, the use of gray-level cooccurence representations [3,4] to analyze texture has proved to be very successful and robust. Linear filtering is another common approach to extract local texture properties from images. Studies in linear filter design theory <ref> [5] </ref> show that it is possible to design and optimize local linear filters for maximal texture discrimination. Some of the more recent linear filtering schemes seek to exploit certain properties of human vision.

Reference-contexts: Some of the more recent linear filtering schemes seek to exploit certain properties of human vision. The use of Gaussian-modulated sinusoids (Gabor functions) to model cortical simple cell receptive field profiles was proposed in 1980 by Marcelja <ref> [6] </ref> in 1-D form and by Daugman [7] in 2-D form. The virtues of the functional form of the Gabor transform include its explicit parameterization for 2-D receptive field position, preferred orientation and preferred spatial frequency.

Reference-contexts: The virtues of the functional form of the Gabor transform include its explicit parameterization for 2-D receptive field position, preferred orientation and preferred spatial frequency. These findings led to the use of these biologically parameterized 2-D Gabor functions as image primitives, for their usefulness in image data compression <ref> [8] </ref> and texture analysis and segmentation [9,10]. A recent review of early vision research by Bela Julesz [11], notes that texture segmentation is not governed by global (statistical) rules, but rather depends on local, nonlinear features.

Reference-contexts: Both these textures are a conglomeration of rather evenly spaced linear features and hence the conventional technique <ref> [10] </ref> using the Gabor features will attempt to discriminate between the two textures based on the periodicity of the spacing between the linear features.

Reference-contexts: We use a set of these circular-Mellin texture operators and combine their individual segmentation results to reduce false alarms and improve segmentation performance. In Section 2, we briefly review the use of circular harmonic functions (CHFs) for rotation-invariant recognition <ref> [12] </ref>. In Section 3, we provide an overview of the Mellin harmonic functions (MHFs) for scale-invariant target recognition. We develop the conjoint rotation and scale invariant texture operator in Section 4, using our results from Sections 2 and 3.

Reference-contexts: An alternate interpretation of the properties of these "circular-Mellin" transforms can be obtained based on the properties of the Fourier series and Fourier transform <ref> [13] </ref>. In Cartesian coordinates, the magnitude of the Fourier coefficient is shift-invariant, i.e. the magnitude carries the structural information within the target of interest while the actual location of the target is lost in the phase information.
