Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the field of computer vision, texture segmentation has been investigated by many researchers using a diversity of approaches. In general, each method consists of two phases: feature extraction and segmentation. Features for texture representation are of crucial importance for accomplishing segmentation <ref> [1] </ref>. Previous approaches for representing texture features can be divided into two categories [2, 3]: 1. Statistical approaches: co-occurrence matrixes [4], second-order statistics [5], numbers of local extrema [6], local linear transformations [7], autoregressive moving average (ARMA) [8], and Markov random fields [9][10][11][12]. 2. <p> Experimental results are shown in Figures 10, 11, 12. * Synthetic textures. We also tested the performance of our algorithm on several synthetic images of texture. Figure 13 shows a segmentation result on a Gaussian low-pass texture image <ref> [1] </ref>, and Figure 14 shows a segmentation result on a filtered impulse noise (FIN) texture image [1] The accuracy of our segmentation results are summarized in Table 1. In general, we found that envelope representations obtained from DWPF analysis outperformed similar representations computed from standard DWF. <p> We also tested the performance of our algorithm on several synthetic images of texture.

In fact, pychovisual experiments suggest the presence of a "biological spectrum analyzer" within the human visual system [24].

In an earlier study, envelopes obtained from channel outputs were used by A.Bovik <ref> [17] </ref> for texture analysis and segmentation in the setting of Gabor multi-channel filtering. The 2-D complex Gabor filters used by Bovik approximated a pair of conjugate filters. In addition, the approach of squaring followed by iterative low-pass filtering used by Unser [22] can also be interpreted as envelope detection.

Reference-contexts: For wavelet packet or recursive filter bank decomposi tions, Quadrature Mirror Filters (QMF) are preferred because each filter generated within the filter bank will not exhibit a multi-lobe property. Unfortunately, a compactly supported QMF cannot be symmetric or anti-symmetric <ref> [31] </ref>. For multi-channel decompositions using a QMF, all filters are generated from a prototype filter that satisfies the property: jH 0 (!)j + jH 0 (! + )j = 1 (9) 5 * Edge detection performance.

Reference-contexts: But, such a filter may have a longer support in time domain, and thus offer less time domain separation. Such contradictory construction requirements are well demonstrated by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Please see Wilson et al <ref> [34] </ref> [35] for a further discussion on how the selection of frequency localization can effect the performance of several image processing applications. In this investigation, we selected Lemarie-Battle wavelets, which are symmetric and quadrature mirror filters (QMF).

Reference-contexts: Two of our proposed feature extraction schemes is based on edge detection. We considered two approaches to detect edges: identifying the zero crossings and local maxima. J.Canny's paper <ref> [37] </ref> provides valuable insights into the desired properties of a filter used for edge detection. The basic requirement is that a detection scheme should exhibit good performance under noisy conditions.

Reference-contexts: Fundamentally, this can be considered a multi-dimensional data clustering problem. As pointed out by Haralick <ref> [39] </ref>, at present no general algorithms exist for this problem. Clustering algorithms that have been previously used for texture segmentation can be divided into two categories: supervised segmentation and unsupervised segmentation. For practical applications, unsupervised segmentation is desirable and easy to test.

Reference-contexts: For practical applications, unsupervised segmentation is desirable and easy to test. It is particularly useful in those cases where testing samples are difficult to prepare (making supervised segmentation infeasible). Since our present work emphasized feature extraction (representation), we used a traditional K-MEANS clustering algorithm <ref> [40] </ref> [41] [42]. An overview of the algorithm is sketched below: Algorithm K-MEANS (x [1 : N; 1 : M ],N C) x [1 : N; 1 : M ]: array of structure containing vector and label fields.

Reference-contexts: In particular, we applied a 9 fi 9 median filtering to each initial segmentation. To test our segmentation algorithm, we carried out experiments using two distinct families of texture samples: * Natural textures. We used textures obtained from the Brodatz album <ref> [43] </ref>. Each testing sample was histogram equalized so that a segmentation result based only on first order statistics was not possible. Experimental results are shown in Figures 10, 11, 12. * Synthetic textures. We also tested the performance of our algorithm on several synthetic images of texture.
