Abstract: When a group fI 1 ; : : :; I n g of individuals wishes to collaboratively construct a complex multimedia document, the first requirement is that they be able to manipulate media-objects created by one another. For instance, if individual I j wishes to access some media objects present at participant I k 's site, he must be able to; (1) retrieve this object from across the network, (2) ensure that the object is in a form that is compatible with the viewing/editing resources he has available at his node, and (3) ensure that the object has the desired quality (such as image size and resolution). Furthermore, he must be able to achieve these goals at the lowest possible cost. In this paper, we develop a theory of media objects, and present optimal algorithms for collaborative object sharing/synthesis of the sort envisaged above. We then extend the algorithms to incorporate quality constraints (such as image size) as well as distribution across multiple nodes. The theoretical model is validated by an experimental implementation that supports the theoretical results.

Reference-contexts: Most current systems that implement such schemes (e.g. the Sun ShowMe repertoire of products) require that all nodes in the collaborative enterprise have certain common products available on them, (viz. the Sun ShowMe system). In Part II of this series of papers <ref> [1] </ref>, we will show how we may build upon the framework presented in this paper to solve this important problem.

Reference-contexts: In addition to significant amount of work in the areas of CSCW, recent work in this area includes the hypermedia conversation recording system of Imai et al.<ref> [2] </ref>, multipoint conferencing system of Gong [3], and Argo [4]. In [2], Imai et al. show how to record the artifacts of a realtime collaboration so that when the collaboration is concluded, the collaborators have access not only to the final document, but also to the artifacts (handwritten notes, voice annotations etc.) that led them to this document.

The Argo system [4] on the other hand, is built to let users collaborate remotely using video, audio, shared applications, and whiteboards.

Wolf et al <ref> [6] </ref> show how an application can be shared among heterogeneous systems. They compare two methods for heterogeneous sharing: one optimizes transmission in the system and other optimizes conversions between objects.

Ahuja's group at AT&T <ref> [7] </ref> also has had significant contributions in collaborative services. They propose a method for generating visual representations of recorded histories of distributed collaborations, so that remote collaborators can easily access information that will let them understand how the collaborative environement evolved to a particular state.

Medusa provides an environment which facilitates rapid prototyping of new applications. Rajan, Vin et al. <ref> [10] </ref> started some work on formalizing the notion of multimedia collaboration. They provide a basis which can support a wide spectrum of structured multimedia collaborations. Their formalization captures the requirements of various types of interactive and non-interactive collaborations. They also implemented a prototype collaboration management system based on their formalism.
