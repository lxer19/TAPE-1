Reference-contexts: The notation Cb n is used to refer to the Cb of sentence n, and Cf n likewise to the Cf list of sentence n. Following <ref> [1] </ref>, I refer to the highest-ranked forward-looking center Cf 1 n as Cp n . Roughly speaking, Cf n contains all entities that can be referred to in sentence n; amongst this list is Cb n . <p> That is, even if "He" refers to Tony and "him" refers to Terry, then Rule 1 remains satisfied. Likewise in sentence (1e), Rule 1 doesn't make any prediction since there is only one pronominalized entity. The algorithm of Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard (henceforth BFP) <ref> [1] </ref> utilizes Rule 2 in making predictions for pronominal reference. They augment the hierarchy with a fourth relation, termed Shifting-1: * Center Shifting-1: Cb n =Cp n , Cb n 6= Cb n1 . <p> In this section I note some constraints that must augment Centering Theory in its determination of pronominal referents. While these constraints are well-known and are generally employed in systems (e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>), the discussion will lay the groundwork for a more extensive proposal given in Section 4. First, the extent to which Shifts cause additional processing load depends on the agreement features of the pronouns (i.e., gender, number, person).

Reference-contexts: She called him at 6AM. e. He was sick and furious at being woken up so early. Unlike the garden path effect caused by sentence (1e), the identical (2e) is easily processable since the pronoun has only one possible referent. Second, as is well-established <ref> [2, 7, 8, 10] </ref>, intrasentential coreference constraints may rule out possible reference assignments. For example, in passage (3), (3) No one spoke to Oscar yesterday at Ernie's party. Oscar felt sorry for him. the pronoun him cannot refer to Oscar, because a reflexive would have to be used. <p> We use these two rules in conjunction with the following constraints, adapted from Binding Theory <ref> [2] </ref>: 2 2 Besides treating nominative and genitive pronouns as ambiguous between reflexive and non-reflexive forms, we also break from Binding Theory in not employing the notion of minimal domains.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Centering has been proposed as a theory of how referring expressions interact with mechanisms used to maintain coherence in discourse <ref> [3, 4, 6] </ref>. The theory is primarily generation-oriented; its rules make their strongest predictions from the perspective of producing discourse. The theory makes less strong predictions on the interpretation side, for instance, in predicting the referents of pronouns.

I conclude in Section 5. 2 Centering Theory In the Centering Theory of Grosz et al. (henceforth GJW) <ref> [4] </ref>, each utterance in a discourse has exactly one backward-looking center (denoted Cb) and a partially-ordered set of forward-looking centers (Cf 1 ; :::; Cf n ).

Reference-contexts: He wanted Tony to join him on a sailing expedition. d. He called him at 6AM. e. He was sick and furious at begin woken up so early. Example (1) shows that there is more to pronoun determination than intersentential coherence determination alone (cf. <ref> [5, 11] </ref>). However, Rule 1 of Centering Theory doesn't predict with which entities in sentence (1c) the pronouns in sentence (1d) corefer, since both references in sentence (1d) are pronominalized. That is, even if "He" refers to Tony and "him" refers to Terry, then Rule 1 remains satisfied. <p> I note that examples (6) and (7) further show that there is more to determining coreference than computing coherence relations <ref> [5, 11] </ref>. In each of these examples, assigning the referent of the second pronoun to Sandy (unlike assigning it to Terry) results in perfectly well-formed and coherent text. <p> The data presented cast further doubt on proposals that coreference is determined solely on the basis of coherence determination <ref> [5, 11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This is predicted since neither possessive c-commands the other in the conjoined phrase. The predictions of the theory are further supported by example (10), taken from an actual movie review <ref> [9] </ref>: 6 (10) Robert Downey, Jr. does a wonderful job as Chaplin. I even began to think of him as Chaplin midway through the film. What is interesting about this example is the use of Chaplin instead of him in the second sentence.
