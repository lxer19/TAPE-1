Abstract: This paper appeared in 1995 in The Proceedings of the Seventeenth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, 709-714. Pittsburgh: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. Abstract The subject of this paper is the role of transferable commonsense principles in the acquisition of game-playing expertise. We argue that individuals skilled in a domain develop expertise because they know and apply these principles, and that most game-playing programs do not play like people. The paper describes Hoyle, a model of an expert game player that relies on the use of commonsense principles, limited memory, and useful knowledge to learn to play two-person, perfect information finite-board games expertly. We then describe an experiment in which human subjects played three such games against a computer expert. After playing these games, the subjects evaluated Hoyle's game-playing principles in the context of their own behavior. Verbal protocols and subjects' evaluations revealed considerable overlap between the principles preferred by our subjects and those preferred by Hoyle. Using learning time as a measure of difficulty, the subjects' performance and Hoyle's performance ordered the three games identically. This experiment also revealed differences in the use of game-playing principles between skilled and unskilled players: skilled players judged the game-playing principles to be more effective than did unskilled players, skilled players used several different principles while unskilled players relied on one principle, and skilled players anticipated their opponent's moves while unskilled players merely reacted.

Reference-contexts: 2: Heuristic opinions yes make move Blackboard Voting Shneiderman, 1976).) An experts memory is organized around higher-level concepts, not perceptual characteristics, so that a single board configuration that could arise in either of two different games is chunked and recalled differently, depending upon the game in which it is perceived <ref> (Eisenstadt & Kareev, 1975) </ref>. Finally, chess masters consider both their possible moves and the possible moves of their opponents, and use these plans to direct the search process, making it simpler and more efficient (Holding, 1985).

Reference-contexts: Based on the Advisors responses, a simple arithmetic vote selects a move. During play, Hoyle searches no more than two ply (one move for each contestant) ahead in the contest. Further details on Hoyle are available in <ref> (Epstein, 1992) </ref>. A FORR-based program learns from its experience to make better decisions based on acquired useful knowledge. Useful knowledge is expected to be relevant to future decisions and is probably correct in the full context of the search space. <p> This research suggests that Hoyle, with its use of commonsense game-playing principles, limited memory, and useful knowledge, is a plausible model of human performance. Thus, Hoyle is psychologically plausible, is as effective in learning new games as the traditional computer models of expertise <ref> (Epstein, 1992) </ref>, and has the ability to transfer its skill to new games.

Reference-contexts: Hoyle is also an effective game player; it has learned to play 18 different games expertly in competition with a human or programmed opponent. Hoyles learning time averages as few as 14 contests and rarely exceeds 100 contests <ref> (Epstein, 1993) </ref>. Hoyles primary components (the Advisors, shallow search, and useful knowledge) are more psychologically plausible than those of other expert game-playing programs. Thus, the structure and logic of Hoyle seem ideally suited to guide the study of expertise in humans. <p> Both of these characteristics are similar to the performance of Hoyle, and suggest that, with the proper adjustments, Hoyle could be modified to play like a child. There is also evidence that people use FORR-like Advisors in chip design (Biswas, Goldman, Fisher, Bhuva, & Glewwe, 1995). Conclusion Previous work <ref> (e.g., Epstein, 1993) </ref> has shown that Hoyle is an effective computational game-player that efficiently becomes an expert in several different games.

Reference-contexts: How Hoyle Plays Games Hoyle is a program that learns to play two-person, perfect information, finite-board games. It is based on a learning and problemsolving architecture called FORR, predicated upon multiple rationales for decision making <ref> (Epstein, 1994) </ref>. The philosophy behind FORR is that a set of possibly overlapping, approximately correct general principles for decision making can collaborate to achieve a pragmatic synergy.

Reference-contexts: Hoyle too found Patsy to be a highly relevant Advisor, ranked approximately the same way as skilled players value it. (Further work with FORR suggests that later there is a shift back to pattern-based reactivity, one that was neither anticipated nor measured for in this research <ref> (Epstein & Gelfand, 1995) </ref>.) Item analyses of the effectiveness ratings revealed that the differences between the ratings of skilled and unskilled players increased as the games became less familiar, with the skilled players rating the Advisors as more effective.

How Computer Experts Play Games The typical game-playing program is very different from the human expert. It plays only one game, e.g., checkers or Go. With a few notable exceptions, such a program does not learn or plan or retain its experience, and it cannot explain its decisions.
