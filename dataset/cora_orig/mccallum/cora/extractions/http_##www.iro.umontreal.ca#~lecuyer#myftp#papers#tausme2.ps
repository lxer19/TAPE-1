Title: TABLES OF MAXIMALLY-EQUIDISTRIBUTED COMBINED LFSR GENERATORS  
Author: PIERRE L'ECUYER 
Abstract: We give the results of a computer search for maximally-equidistributed combined linear feedback shift register (or Tausworthe) random number generators, whose components are trinomials of degrees slightly less than 32 or 64. These generators are fast and have good statistical properties.

Reference-contexts: is interesting because it permits one to conciliate efficient implementation with statistical robustness, by choosing the P j as trinomials for which the recurrence is easy to implement and runs fast, while making sure that P (z) has many non-zero coefficients and that the combined generator has good equidistribution properties <ref> [1, 7, 10] </ref>. Of course, this is not the only way of constructing generators with good equidistribution; for other approaches, see, e.g., [5, 6, 8] and other references given there.

Reference-contexts: In the present paper, we provide the results of more extensive computer searches, for combined generators with larger periods. The need for large periods is supported by several arguments given, e.g., in <ref> [2, 3, 5] </ref>. The generators given in [4] are for 32-bit computers. Since 64-bit computers are becoming increasingly common, it is important to have good generators designed to fully use the 64-bit words. Some of the generators proposed here do it.

Reference-contexts: Efficient implementations are available for the case where the characteristic polynomial is a trinomial and satisfies some additional conditions. Trinomial-based generators have important statistical defects, but combining them can yield generators that are relatively fast and robust. Such combinations have been proposed and analyzed in <ref> [4, 9, 10] </ref>. In [4], it was explained how to find combined generators with the best possible equidistribution properties in some sense, within specified classes of combined LFSR generators. Three specific combined generators, each with three components and period length near 2 88 , were also given. <p> The sequence fx n g is called the combined LFSR sequence and a generator that produces this fu n g is called a combined LFSR generator. In fact, fx n g follows a recurrence with reducible characteristic polynomial P (z) = P 1 (z) P J (z) <ref> [9] </ref>. Under our assumptions, the sequences fx n g and fu n g have period length ae = (2 k 1 1) fi fi (2 k J 1).
