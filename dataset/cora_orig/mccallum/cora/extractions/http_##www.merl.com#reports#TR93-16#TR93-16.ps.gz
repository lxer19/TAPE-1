Abstract: It is well-known that an FDDI token ring network provides a guaranteed throughput for synchronous messages and a bounded medium access delay for each node/station. However, this fact alone cannot effectively support many real-time applications that require the timely delivery of each critical message. The reason for this is that the FDDI guarantees a medium access delay bound to nodes, but not to messages themselves. The message-delivery delays may exceed the medium-access delay bound even if a node transmits synchronous messages at a rate not greater than the guaranteed throughput. We solve this problem by developing a synchronous bandwidth allocation (SBA) scheme which calculates the synchronous bandwidth necessary for each application to satisfy its message-delivery delay requirement. The result obtained in this paper is essential for effective use of the FDDI token ring networks in supporting such real-time communications as digital video/audio transmissions and distributed control/monitoring.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is a proposed ANSI standard for a 100 Mbps (million bits per second) token ring network using a fiber-optic medium <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4] </ref>. Thanks to its high transmission speed, the FDDI alleviates the bandwidth saturation problem of the current 10 Mbps Ethernet and the 4 or 16 Mbps IEEE 802.5 Token rings. <p> In general, a smaller T T RT gives an FDDI network a better performance in supporting real-time communication (can provide smaller delay bounds and require less synchronous bandwidth) than a larger T T RT . But as discussed in <ref> [1] </ref>, a small T T RT reduces the overall network efficiency due to token passing overheads and ring latency. Thus, unless some applications require very tight delay bounds, a moderate T T RT (around 8 ms) is appropriate.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, the FDDI's capacity of supporting synchronous traffic cannot be effectively used without a proper SBA scheme. Recently, the importance of SBA has been drawing considerable interest. Agrawal et al. <ref> [5] </ref> proposed a normalized proportional SBA scheme which was proven to be able to support any set of synchronous channels with a total peak signal rate no more than 33% of the ring bandwidth. But this scheme has the following disadvantages. 1. <p> It is a global SBA scheme in that the allocation/deallocation of synchronous bandwidth to a node would require to change the synchronous bandwidths previously assigned to all other nodes. A global SBA scheme complicates the implementation of synchronous bandwidth allocation. To improve the scheme in <ref> [5] </ref>, Chen et al. proposed an optimal SBA scheme [6]. However, it still suffers the limitation of d = T and being a global scheme. Besides, it uses an iterative algorithm for the calculation of the optimal bandwidths which may, in theory, need an infinite number of steps to converge. <p> A more general result was obtained by Agrawal et al. in a recent paper <ref> [5] </ref> as stated below. 1 Though it is not in the standard, we assume that a node always transmits its synchronous traffic first for better synchronous performance of the network and simplicity of analysis. 3 Lemma 2.1 (Worst-case token rotation times) . <p> Let bxc be the largest integer which is equal to or smaller than x, and dxe be the smallest integer which is larger than x. The following lemma gives a lower bound of time that node i is allowed to transmit its synchronous messages during a time period t <ref> [5] </ref>. Lemma 2.2 (Synchronous transmission time) . Under the protocol constraint (1) of the FDDI, node i has at least bt=T T RT 1c h i units of time to transmit its synchronous messages during a time period t. <p> We derive in this section the conditions for establishing real-time channels over an FDDI network. From these conditions, a new SBA scheme will be developed which has many advantages over the SBA schemes in <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. Let (t) denote the time that a node in the worst case is allowed to transmit its synchronous messages during a time period t. Lemma 2.2 gives a lower bound of (t) for node i. We improve Lemma 2.2 by calculating the exact value of (t) as follows. <p> Thus for most applications, the synchronous bandwidth allocation resulting from Algorithm 3.1 is optimal. 3. Comparing with the SBA schemes of <ref> [5] </ref> and [6], Algorithm 3.1 has the following advan tages. Generality: The SBA schemes of [5, 6] can establish real-time channels with d = T only, while Algorithm 3.1 can establish channels of arbitrary parameters, i.e., d T or d &gt; T . <p> Thus for most applications, the synchronous bandwidth allocation resulting from Algorithm 3.1 is optimal. 3. Comparing with the SBA schemes of [5] and [6], Algorithm 3.1 has the following advan tages. Generality: The SBA schemes of <ref> [5, 6] </ref> can establish real-time channels with d = T only, while Algorithm 3.1 can establish channels of arbitrary parameters, i.e., d T or d &gt; T . <p> Real-time channels with d &gt; T are also useful for multimedia applications. Thus restricting d = T would greatly limit a network's ability and effectiveness in supporting real-time communications. Optimality: The SBA scheme of <ref> [5] </ref> is not optimal, even under the restrictive assumption of d = T . Thus a real-time channel establishment request may be rejected even if it can be established using a different scheme. <p> The SBA scheme of [6] is optimal under the restrictive assumption of d = T and requires complex computations. By contrast, Algorithm 3.1 is optimal for a much wider range of d (which subsumes the special case of d = T in <ref> [5, 6] </ref>). Simplicity: The SBA schemes of [5, 6] are global schemes in the sense that the addition/removal of a channel or change of the parameters of a channel would require adjustment of the synchronous bandwidth allocations of all nodes in the network. This requires a complex SBA implementation. <p> The SBA scheme of [6] is optimal under the restrictive assumption of d = T and requires complex computations.

By contrast, Algorithm 3.1 needs 10 only local parameter adjustment, thereby making it far easier to implement than those in <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. As an application example of Algorithm 3.1, we calculate the synchronous bandwidth needed for establishing the following video channel in an FDDI network.
