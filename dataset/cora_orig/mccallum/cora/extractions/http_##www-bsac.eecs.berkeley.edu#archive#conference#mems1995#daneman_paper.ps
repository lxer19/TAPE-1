Macroscopic systems typically employ impact actuation in applications where large forces of short duration are required [2].

Reference-contexts: The microphotonics platform [3], for which this actuator was developed, requires motion over hundreds of microns while keeping submicron positional accuracy. The first impact-driven microactuators were demonstrated by Lee, Nikkel, and Pisano, who presented a slider actuated by transverse impact with flexible impact arms <ref> [4] </ref>. We describe a linear microvibromotor driven through stiff oblique impact using a resonant comb structure. The stiff impact delivers a large force of short duration, enabling the actuator to overcome slider sticking. <p> Slider velocity can best be controlled by superimposing a gating signal on top of the resonant waveform and adjusting the gate repetition frequency. 3 Fabrication The vibromotor is fabricated using silicon surface micromachining [5] in a process similar to that used in <ref> [4] </ref>. As shown in Figure 2, two structural layers and one ground-plane layer of polysilicon are required. After sequential passivation layers of thermal silicon dioxide and silicon nitride, a 0.5 m m n+ polysilicon ground plane is deposited and patterned.

Reference-contexts: An additional 1 minute isotropic SF 6 etch is necessary to remove polysilicon stringers between the comb fingers. At this point, the structure is released by a 4-minute etch in concentrated HF followed by a methanol rinse. The vibromotors are dried in a supercritical CO 2 process <ref> [6] </ref> to eliminate sticking due to surface tension. A SEM of the completed and released linear vibromotor is shown in Figure 3. 4 Vibromotor Performance After fabrication, the resonant frequencies of the comb resonators were measured and compared to theoretical predictions.

Reference-contexts: A simplified model can, however, approximate the vibromotor behavior. The analysis begins with an analytical description of the comb resonators followed by a simplified model of the contact between the impact-arm and slider. Polysilicon comb resonators similar to those used in this study have been extensively analyzed <ref> [7] </ref>. The capacitance of the comb structure is a linear function of the finger overlap and the force is proportional to the square of the applied voltage.

Reference-contexts: motion M dt dx k x F t 2 + + = ( ) (5) where M is the mass of the comb structure, k x spring constant of the folded beam, and c is the damping coefficient (primarily due to Couette and Stokes air flow under the comb plate <ref> [8] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: As was mentioned earlier, the vibromotor behavior is quite complex. By making a number of simplifying assumptions we can, however, predict trends in the vibromotor behavior. The primary assumption is to model the impact process as a short-duration Hertzian contact stress <ref> [9] </ref> with a very stiff spring constant. Since the true effective spring constant and comb-drive damping during impact are unknown, their values are used as fitting parameters to make the simulated sliderstep size and transient response conform to measured results.
