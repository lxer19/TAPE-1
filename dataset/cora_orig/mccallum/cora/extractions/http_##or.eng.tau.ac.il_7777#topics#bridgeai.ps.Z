Abstract: The idea to use AI in civil engineering is as old as AI. Since the 50th, studies on AI applications in civil or bridge engineering have proliferated. Most of these studies have dealt with specialized isolated engineering subtasks. Few of the applications have been delivered to practitioners and were used to advance their work. This paper presents a model of the life-cycle flow of information in bridge engineering as an organizing framework for reviewing previous work on AI applications in bridge engineering. Several common patterns that emerge from the studies are summarized. A subsequent analysis of the status of the bridge stock in many countries suggests that a more integrated approach to AI applications may have a larger practical impact. Several practical areas that can benefit significantly from AI techniques are identified and several studies are proposed including the AI technology needed and the methodology according to which these applications should be developed.
