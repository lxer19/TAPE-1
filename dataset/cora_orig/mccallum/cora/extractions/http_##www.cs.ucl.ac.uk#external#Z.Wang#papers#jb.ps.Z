Abstract: This paper examines burstiness and jitter in real-time communications. In this paper, we make so assumptions about the arrival patterns of the incoming traffic but characterize traffic with two parameters. We assume the synchronization process is adaptive so the flow can be divided into smaller synchronization units, and defined jitter using the delay experienced by the first packet in a synchronization unit as the target delay. We presente the results on the relationship between burstiness and jitter, and on the upper bounds of burstiness and jitter.

Reference-contexts: We can view a 1 + r min hhhhhhhhh as the expected arrival time and b m as the difference between the actual arrival time and the expected arrival time. In this sense, the expected arrival time is similar to the Virtual Clock <ref> [3] </ref>. A packet arrived at its expected arrival time experiences no queuing delay. Lemma 3 If S ~ (r max , r min ), for m = 2, 3, ..., M, b m (m -1) hhhhhh (1 - r max r min hhhhh ) Proof.

Reference-contexts: This mismatch results in queuing at the servers.

In this paper, we present a more fine graded definition of burstiness which can reflect the burstiness of individual packets.

Reference-contexts: The recent experience with the VT and Vat packet voice protocols has shown that adjusting the delay offset is feasible and the impacts on the performance are often imperceptible if the adjustment is carried out during silent periods <ref> [9] </ref>. hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Delay Offsets Synchronization Units Sender Receiver 2 Analysis of Burstiness and Jitter - 3 - Z Wang In this paper, we assume the application can adjust the offset delay during the session and the synchronization is required only between packets within a synchronization unit. <p> A synchronization unit is defined as a group of packets that share a common fixed delay offset <ref> [9] </ref>. The delay offset may be adjusted at the beginning of a synchronization unit but should remain unchanged until the end of this synchronization unit. The boundary of a synchronization unit is application-dependent, for example, the most common synchronization units are talkspurts for voice and frames for video.

Reference-contexts: A Characterization of Traffic We assume that all packets are of the same size and the packet header carries an one-bit indicator, such as the s bit in the audio/video transport protocol <ref> [10] </ref>, which marks the boundary of the synchronization units. We make no assumptions about the arrival pattern of the incoming traffic. The traffic in a synchronization unit is characterized by a pair of parameters (r max , r min ).

Reference-contexts: Jitter Jitter is usually defined as the difference between the delay a packet has experienced and the target delay for the flow <ref> [11] </ref>. Since the synchronization is assumed to be adaptive, the target delay can be adjusted at the beginning of a synchronization unit. In this paper, we use the delay experienced by the first packet of a synchronization unit as the target delay.

Reference-contexts: The (r max , r min ) pair is a generalization of characteristics in variable rate audio and video traffic. In digital audio with silence suppression, there is a clear pattern of busy period and silent period <ref> [13] </ref>. A synchronization unit starts with a busy period followed by a silent period. In such cases, r max equals to the sampling rate during the busy period and r min equals to the average rate of the whole unit. Similar patterns are also observed in variable rate video [14].
