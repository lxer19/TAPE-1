Abstract: Enforcing ontologies as conceptualisation standards in distributed architectures has some importan t drawbacks. It is, for instance, no solution for the legacy problem. In this article we address the possibility of accepting multiple heterogeneous ontologies in a distributed architecture. After discussing alternative way s to relate several ontologies we look into one particular (hierarchical) configuration of heterogeneou s ontologies and examine how information can passed between individual systems that are linked to differen t ontologies.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, information systems can be integrated by mapping th e information systems ontologies onto a shared ontology. The latter idea is comparable to the use of a lingua franca in language translation. In the ontology field this approach has been adopted in, fo r instance, the SIMS project <ref> (Arens et al., 1996) </ref>, the Information Manifold Project (Levy et al., 1996), and the Garlic Project (Tork Roth, et al., 1997). Both solutions are problematic in that adopting a single shared domain ontology faces major desig n and maintenance problems ( e.g., McDermott, 1993). <p> This , however, would mean that we lose information. The translation is not meaning preserving. Th e definition of the hierarchy of ontology clusters allows us to preserve the meaning of an expression s 9 when translating it into its parent ontology. This is achieved by definition substitution <ref> (e.g., Arens et al., 1996) </ref>; the idea being that every term that is unknown in the parent ontology is replaced by it s definition (as contained in the child ontology). Although this principle will usually work there is a caveat.

Reference-contexts: The distinction being that a primary ontolog y defines the basic concepts and relations in a domain ( e.g., apple, pear) and the secondary ontology adds a dimension to the concepts and relations ( e.g., rotten, red) by distinguishing additiona l features <ref> (e.g., Borst et al., 1996) </ref>. 5. Terminological, Information and Knowledge modelling ontologies : The difference between thes e three types of ontologies is defined by the amount and type of structure in an ontology (Va n Heijst, 1995; Van Heijst et al., 1997).

Reference-contexts: We list four of these: & Standards are often rather heavy vehicles that are not very convenient to use (since they have t o accommodate all potential communication needs) (e.g., McDermott, 1993). & Defining standards is a lengthy and nontrivial task, as is their maintenance <ref> ( e.g., Farquhar et al. 1997) </ref>. & Standardising impedes heterogeneity among agents. It is, for instance, no solution for the legac y problem since it may require that participating software agents have to be redesigned. & Standards tend to impede changes in communication patterns, thus hindering changes i n organisations. <p> Domain partitioning: An obvious way to allow multiple ontologies in an architecture is to partition the domain itself in logical units, each representing another fragment of the domain. Th e Ontolingua ontology library, for instance, holds a collection ontologies for sets, numbers, lists, etc. <ref> (Farquhar et al., 1997) </ref>. 2. Alternative domain views: Multiple ontologies can coexist in a distributed architecture by allowin g different possibly inconsistent - views of the same fragment of the domain. <p> Restriction (overriding). Ontology O is a restriction of ontology O if all definitions in ontolog y 2 1 O hold in ontology O except for those that are redefined <ref> ( cf. Farquhar et al. 1997) </ref>. This relation 1 2 can be us ed in combination with alternative domain views, abstraction, primary and secondar y ontologies, and terminology / information / knowledge modelling ontologies. d.

Reference-contexts: We cannot assum e that they have a shared conceptualisation, and hence, we cannot assume that equivalent terms and/o r definitions denote the same concepts <ref> (cf. Gasser, 1991) </ref>. This is different with the translations between shared ontologies. The hierarchical structure implies that all shared ontologies always have at leas t one ontology in common. Ultimately, all ontologies share the top-level ontology (observation o3).

Reference-contexts: This is d one in two ways. First, by choosing the non-primitive terms such that the user alread y cf. A modular organization is one that organizes units in modules so that the cohesion within modules i s 2 maximal, while the interaction between modules is minimal <ref> (Van Heijst et al., 1997, p.194) </ref>. 4 has an indication about what the term denotes. Second, by relying on primitives that have a rathe r unequivocal meaning. The problem is that this both links are rather weak. <p> We focus on domai n ontologies and exclude definitions of ontologies that are mainly used for knowledge-engineerin g purposes, such as task, method, representation and application ontologies <ref> (Van Heijst et al., 1997) </ref>. In the remainder, we assume that an ontology consists of a set of definitions of classes, relations , instances, functions, and axioms ( cf. Gruber, 1992).
