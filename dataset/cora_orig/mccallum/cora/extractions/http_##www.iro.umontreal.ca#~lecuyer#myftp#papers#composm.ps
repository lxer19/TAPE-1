Title: ORBITS AND LATTICES FOR LINEAR RANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS WITH COMPOSITE MODULI  
Author: RAYMOND COUTURE AND PIERRE L'ECUYER 
Abstract: In order to analyze certain types of combinations of multiple recursive linear congruential generators (MRGs), we introduce a generalized spectral test. We show how to apply the test in large dimensions by a recursive procedure based on the fact that such combinations are subgenerators of other MRGs with composite moduli. We illustrate this with the well-known RAN-MAR generator. We also design an algorithm generalizing the procedure to arbitrary random number generators.

Reference-contexts: a given finite family of generators ( i ; T i ; i ) one may form the combined generator ( Q Q i T i ; ) where ((oe i ) i ) = P i i (oe i ). (Other combination methods have been used in actual implementations <ref> [1, 6, 9] </ref> but they are often well approximated by combinations in the above sense.) The lattices fl d (resp. fl (d) ) associated with a combination are the sum (resp. intersection) of those associated with the components.

Reference-contexts: Thus, applying the spectral test to our product generator is easily performed by standard algorithms (such as in <ref> [2] </ref>), at least if the dimension is not much larger than 97. The results for this case are indicated in line l = 1 of the table. For later use, we define H (d) ae R d as the hyperplane f P P i x i = 0g.
