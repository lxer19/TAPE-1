Abstract: The IP multicast delivery mechanism provides a popular basis for delivery of continuous media to many participants in a conferencing application. However, the best-effort nature of multicast delivery results in poor playback quality in the presence of network congestion and packet loss. Contrary to widespread belief that the real-time nature of continuous media applications precludes the possibility of recovery of lost packets using retransmissions, we have found that these applications offer an interesting tradeoff between the desired playback quality and the desired degree of in-teractivity. In particular, we propose a new model of multi-cast delivery called resilient multicast in which each receiver in a multicast group can decide its own tradeoff between reliability and real-time requirements. To be effective, error recovery mechanisms in such a model need to be both fast (due to the real-time constraint) and have a low overhead (due to high volume of continuous media data). We have designed a resilient multicast protocol called STORM (STructure-Oriented Resilient Multi-cast) in which senders and receivers collaborate to recover from lost packets using two key ideas. First, group participants self-organize themselves into a distribution structure and use the structure to recover lost packets from adjacent nodes. Second, the distribution structure is dynamic and a lightweight algorithm is used to adapt the structure to changing network traffic conditions and group membership. We have implemented STORM in both VAT and a packet level simulator. Experimental results using both the MBONE and a simulation model demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Reference-contexts: We are using an ARQ mechanism for continuous media applications. Recently, Bolot and others <ref> [1] </ref> proposed use of FEC for CM applications. One advantage of FEC-based error control is that the recovery latency is smaller than the ARQ method provided the packet transmission rate is high. However, the FEC mechanism usually requires higher bandwidth than the selective retransmission approach.

Reference-contexts: The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We first begin with a description of the resilient multicast and how it differs from the conventional notion of reliable multi-cast (Section 2). Section 3 summarizes Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) <ref> [9] </ref>, a well-known protocol for achieving large-scale, reliable multicast using receiver-driven error recovery, and points out its relevance to our work. We then describe the details of a new protocol called STORM (Structure-Oriented Resilient Mul-ticast) based on our approach (Section 4). <p> Reliable multicast transport is typically needed by a data dissemination application such as a whiteboard (e.g. wb) where a sender wishes to reliably deliver all the parts of its presentation to all the receivers. Many researchers <ref> [9, 13, 26, 25, 10] </ref> have examined ways of reliably delivering data to all the recipients within a multicast group. Resilient multicast, on the other hand, is directed at continuous media (CM) applications, creating significant differences in the delivery requirements of the two sets of applications: 1. <p> Therefore, reliable multicast protocols rely on a combination of negative acknowledgements (NACKs) and selective re-transmissions to recover from lost packets. In addition, some form of NACK aggregation may be used to further increase efficiency. Among several reliable multicast protocols proposed in the literature, Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) protocol <ref> [9] </ref>, used in the popular Internet wb program, is a good example of such a protocol. We will use SRM's error recovery mechanisms to motivate our design of a protocol for resilient multicast. <p> For the SRM implementation, each host in the mul-ticast group exchanges a periodic, low-frequency session message so that the distance between any two hosts can be estimated. We used the following set of parameters in the SRM protocol <ref> [9] </ref>: C 1 = C 2 = 2:5 and D 1 = D 2 = 2:5, which, according to our experience, provide acceptable performance. For both STORM-based vat and SRM-based vat, we ran many experiments at different times of day, with different hosts as the data source.

Reference-contexts: In our evaluation, we assume all unicast packets incur same overhead to the network. For a multicast packet that is transmitted to N receivers, we assume it has a cost N=2 times the cost of a unicast packet <ref> [18] </ref>. We call this the normalized cost for a multicast packet. We use an additional performance metric to characterize both the application performance improvement and the protocol overhead. <p> Third, STORM uses a light-weight method for building and maintaining a loop-free structure which keeps the overhead very small. For example, the level-assignment approach allows us to keep the structure loop-free implicitly without explicit exchange of state information among the participants. As pointed out by Pejhan et al. <ref> [18] </ref>, there are three techniques that are used to deal with transmission errors in real-time continuous media applications: automatic repeat request (ARQ), forward error control (FEC), and error concealment (EC). We are using an ARQ mechanism for continuous media applications.

Reference-contexts: However, such an approach does not scale very well as the number of receivers increases. Ramakrishnan and Jain <ref> [20] </ref> were the first to explore a receiver-initiated approach in which the burden of ensuring reliable delivery is shifted to the receivers. The SRM protocol discussed earlier is an excellent example of this approach in which the receivers are completely responsible to ensure reliable delivery.

Reference-contexts: By moving the token site around all the members in the group, the protocol ensures a totally ordered reliable service. Another protocol based on Chang and Maxemchuk's work is RMP (Reliable Multicast Protocol) <ref> [24] </ref>. The approach used in STORM differs in many ways. First, STORM does not require a parent to maintain any state information (or aggregation of ACKs) about its children. Instead, every receiver identifies potential parents and selects a list of its parents based on each parent's loss rate characteristics.
