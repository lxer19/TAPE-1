Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In a grid drawing of a graph, the vertices are represented by distinct points with integer coordinates and the edges are represented by straight-line segments connecting the corresponding pairs of points. Grid drawings in the plane have a vast literature <ref> [BE] </ref>. In particular, it is known that every planar graph of n vertices has a two-dimensional grid drawing that fits into a rectangle of area O (n 2 ), and this bound is asymptotically tight [FP],[S]. The possibility of three-dimensional representations of graphs was suggested by software engineers [MR].

Reference-contexts: The possibility of three-dimensional representations of graphs was suggested by software engineers [MR]. The analysis of the volume requirement of such representations was initiated in <ref> [CE] </ref>, where the following statement was proved. Every graph of n vertices has a three-dimensional grid drawing in a rectangular box of volume O (n 3 ), and this bound cannot be improved. To establish the first half of the statement, it is sufficient to consider representations of complete graphs. <p> It was pointed out by Cohen et al. <ref> [CE] </ref> that K 2 (n) has a three-dimensional grid drawing within a box of volume O (n 2 ), and they asked whether this bound is optimal. T. Calamoneri and A. Sterbini [CS] proved that any such drawing requires a box whose volume is at least (n 3=2 ).

Reference-contexts: Let V 1 and V 2 be the vertex classes of K 2 (n) and let V 1 = f (i; 0; 0) j 0 i dn=2e 1g ; - 4 - where k q Then jV 1 j = dn=2e; k X (i) 2 n=2 (see <ref> [HW] </ref>). To see that there is no crossing, we observe that the points of V 2 lie on a horizontal plane and there are no two of these points on a line through (0; 0; 0) (see Figure). 2 Figure A.
