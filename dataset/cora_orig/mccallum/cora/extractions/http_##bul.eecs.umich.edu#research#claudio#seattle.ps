Abstract: Mean scatterer spacing (MSS) has been recognized as an effective tool for characterization and discrimination of tissues that present a semi-regular lattice of scat-terers. The spectrum of the ultrasound echo of these tissues presents a number of harmonics due to the semi-regular scatterer distribution. A new algorithm for estimating the MSS by exploring the harmonic contents of the ultrasound echo is presented. This algorithm also provides a reliability indicator of the MSS estimate allowing for acceptance or rejection of the estimate. Simulations show that the acceptance criterion has been effective in reducing the standard deviation of the MSS estimates. In vitro experiments were conducted to illustrate the practical use of the proposed algorithm in the estimation of MSS.

Reference-contexts: Mean scatterer spacing (MSS) has been recognized as an effective tool for characterization and discrimination of tissues that present a semi-regular lattice of scatterers <ref> [1] </ref>. Furthermore, it has recently been shown to be a valuable tool for non-invasive estimation of temperature change caused by an externally applied heating field [2]. Many authors assume that for certain tissues the echo is originated from two different types of structures. <p> The former are usually referred to as regular scatterers and the later as diffuse scatterers. Fellingham and Sommer <ref> [1] </ref> showed good agreement between this model and the actual tissue histological architecture for the cases of human liver and spleen. Normal human liver tissue is organized into small histologic units, the classic lobule, which correspond to the regular scatterers in this model. <p> The other reflecting structures present in tissue (speckle) are associated with the diffuse scatterers. The aim of mean scatterer spacing estimation is to measure the average distance between regular scatterers. Fellingham and Sommer <ref> [1] </ref> used the histogram of the peak of the autocorrelation of the magnitude of the spectra computed through an FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) of the echo to estimate the MSS. <p> For some applications [2] it may be necessary to have a reliable localized estimate of the MSS, instead of a single estimate of the MSS for the whole tissue sample obtained by averaging large data sets <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. Although it is possible to obtain localized estimates using the SAC algorithm, it would be impractical for real-time applications, due to its computationally intensive calculations.

Reference-contexts: For narrow-band transducers they found it necessary to normalize the magnitude of the spectra of the echo prior to taking the autocorrelation. This normalization was done to compensate for the transducer impulse response.

Wear and co-workers [3] introduced the use of an autoregres-sive (AR) model (Burg's method <ref> [4] </ref>) for the power spectral density estimation instead of the periodogram approach. The MSS was estimated using the cepstrum of the magnitude of the spectra (rather than the autocorrelation) which converts the multiplicative effect of the transducer response into an additive effect eliminating the need for normalization. <p> The filter coefficients were chosen based on the autoregressive characteristic of ultrasonic transducers. The impulse response of the transducer was modeled by a low model order Yule-Walker autoregressive (AR) model <ref> [4] </ref>: a = R 1 r; (1) where R is the autocorrelation matrix, r is the autocorrelation vector, a = [a 1 ; a 2 ; a 3 ; : : : ; a p ] 0 is the vector of the AR model coefficients, and p is the model order. <p> The FIR filter was implemented as: y (n) = k=0 where x (n) is the echo signal, y (n) is the pre-filtered echo, and a 0 = 1. The pre-filtered signal was modeled using a higher order least squares autoregressive model <ref> [4] </ref> and the estimated spectrum calculated. The least squares method was chosen in this case to highlight the peaks that are present in the spectra. The N strongest peak frequencies were identified as harmonic candidates h n .

Reference-contexts: This study compared the two approaches and concluded that for short data lengths (about 4mm for a MSS of 2.54mm) the AR/cepstrum performed better than the periodogram approach. Varghese and Donohue in <ref> [5] </ref> introduced a method termed spectral autocorrelation (SAC) as being a more robust tool to estimate MSS. <p> In this paper we introduce a new algorithm which produces a localized estimate of the MSS together with a reliability indicator for the estimate, allowing for acceptance or rejection of the MSS estimates. 2 Theory It was shown in <ref> [2, 5] </ref> that the power spectral density (PSD) of the echo of a perfectly regular tissue will present peaks at the harmonic frequencies f k = kf 1 , k = 1; 2; 3; : : :. <p> The number of harmonic candidates preserved in step 2 is used as an indicator for the reliability of the MSS estimate. The MSS estimate is accepted only if this number is greater than a pre-determined threshold K. 3 Simulations and Experiments The model developed by Varghese and Donohue <ref> [5] </ref> was used to generate several sets of data. Two types of scatterers were assumed: regular (Gamma spatial distribution, uniformly distributed amplitude) and diffuse (Poisson spatial distribution, uniformly distributed amplitude scaled by A d ).
