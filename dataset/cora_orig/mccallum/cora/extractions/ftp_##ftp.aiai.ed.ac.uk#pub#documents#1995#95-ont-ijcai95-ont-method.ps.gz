Reference-contexts: * a paper by Gruber discussing principles for designing ontologies [2]; * A paper by Skuce addressing the important issue of reaching agreement as a necessary step to sharing and integrating ontologies between multiple parties [10]; * A set of papers by Gomez-Perez on evaluation of knowledge sharing technology (e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>). The goal of this paper is to take a further step. We first propose a skeletal methodology for building ontologies. We define a small number of stages that we believe will be required for any future comprehensive methodology. <p> a good definition of evaluation in the context of knowledge sharing technology: "to make a technical judgement of the ontologies, their associated software environment, and documentation with respect to a frame of reference : : : The frame of reference may be requirements specifications, competency questions, and/or the real world. <ref> [1] </ref>" Some detailed work has been done on evaluation of ontologies which could contribute to a comprehensive methodology for building ontologies.

Reference-contexts: However, we are aware of no proposals for a general methodology for building ontologies. Some significant steps in this direction are described in: * IDEF5: [8] a language and method for describing ontologies; * a paper by Gruber discussing principles for designing ontologies <ref> [2] </ref>; * A paper by Skuce addressing the important issue of reaching agreement as a necessary step to sharing and integrating ontologies between multiple parties [10]; * A set of papers by Gomez-Perez on evaluation of knowledge sharing technology (e.g. [1]). <p> Indeed, some of the design decisions of the KSL Ontology Editor 1 presume that ontology builders may be developing the conceptualisation on the fly 2 . This may be appropriate in some cases, however our experience suggests that many benefits derive from separating the two. Gruber's criteria <ref> [2] </ref> for designing ontologies are relevant to the capture and coding stages. and should be integrated into any methodology. Insofar as an ontology is a kind of a knowledge base, there is a wealth of useful methodological guidance that is potentially applicable. <p> Some of these include: * BSDM: [6] a comprehensive method developed by IBM for modelling enterprises as a preliminary step to developing IT systems; * KADS; [13] * IDEF5 [8]; * Object-Oriented Analysis and Design techniques (e.g ORCA); AIAI-TR-183 Page 7 of 13 * Tom Gruber's principles for ontology design <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We have produced a document containing definitions of a substantial variety and number of terms expressed in natural language text. Although relatively informal, great lengths were taken to ensure precision, avoid ambiguity, and make connections between similar things explicit. This facilitated subsequent coding of the terms in Ontolingua <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.2 Initial Considerations Initially, the following main issues were addressed: * Decide what exactly it is that we intend to build (i.e. agree on a working definition of the term `ontology'); * Identification of who would use the ontology and how would it be used; * Choosing the most appropriate <p> Competency questions may serve a useful purpose in the later stage of evaluating the ontology code and when scenarios are being developed. Choosing a representation language | Candidate ontology languages identified included: Ontolingua <ref> [3] </ref>, KADS domain modelling language [13], Conceptual Graphs [11], IDEF5 [8], and BSDM [6] mapping language for business entities and processes.

Reference-contexts: ATOS [7]). We are aware of no comprehensive surveys which attempt to identify and classify the range of all such purposes and end users, though [5] may constitute a step in that direction, at a fairly general level. Competency questions <ref> [4] </ref> can be seen as relating to the purpose of an ontology in very specific terms. Such a survey would be a useful starting point for ontology developers, assisting them to clarify their own purpose (s). It could thus play the role of a reference document in a comprehensive methodology. <p> The main use of the ontology is as an inter-lingua, as noted above. Classes of users identified included: ontology developers, ontology maintainers, users of ontology as basis of KBs for end-user applications. AIAI-TR-183 Page 6 of 13 We agree in principle with the idea of precise competency questions <ref> [4] </ref> to guide the ontology development. However, these sorts of question were too specific to guide the early development of our ontology. No detailed scenarios for end applications had been prepared.

Reference-contexts: the implicit rules constraining the structure of a piece of reality; * ontological theory: a set of formulas intended to be always true according to a certain conceptualisation; * ontology: refers to either or both of the above; disambiguated by context (this and previous two terms are as given in <ref> [5] </ref>). AIAI-TR-183 Page 2 of 13 2 A Skeletal Methodology We envisage a comprehensive methodology for developing ontologies to include the following stages: * Indentify Purpose; * Building the Ontology; Ontology capture, Ontology coding, Integrating Existing Ontologies; * Evaluation; * Documentation. <p> The literature is currently rich with descriptions of ontologies and their intended purposes. At a high level, most seem to be intended for some manner of re-use. Some of these purposes are implicit in the various interpretations of the word `ontology' as noted in <ref> [5] </ref> (e.g. a vocabulary for vs a meta-level specification of a logical theory). <p> ATOS [7]). We are aware of no comprehensive surveys which attempt to identify and classify the range of all such purposes and end users, though <ref> [5] </ref> may constitute a step in that direction, at a fairly general level. Competency questions [4] can be seen as relating to the purpose of an ontology in very specific terms. <p> What is an Ontology? After much discussion, we agreed to use the definition proposed by Gruber: `an explicit specification of a conceptualisation'. However, it was noted that this definition left much open for interpretation. Using Guarino's subsequently introduced terminology <ref> [5] </ref>, our text document describes a conceptualisation and the code is the corresponding ontological theory. Purpose and Users | Initially this was discussed at a fairly abstract level.

The criteria used for choosing the most appropriate ontology language included: * perspicuity, * `conceptual distance': extent to which the semantic primitives are `close' to how language users think about the concepts to be represented. <p> Choosing an ontology capture method | We went through a similar exercise for choosing a method for ontology capture. There are very few such methods per se, but various sources of information exist. Some of these include: * BSDM: <ref> [6] </ref> a comprehensive method developed by IBM for modelling enterprises as a preliminary step to developing IT systems; * KADS; [13] * IDEF5 [8]; * Object-Oriented Analysis and Design techniques (e.g ORCA); AIAI-TR-183 Page 7 of 13 * Tom Gruber's principles for ontology design [2]. <p> As such, it is appropriate to consider how to apply general ideas on categorisation to the choice of categories in modelling. In this discussion, we draw on work in cognitive psychology and linguistics from [9] and considerable experience of modelling using the BSDM method <ref> [6] </ref> developed by IBM. 3.3.1 A Theory of Categorisation Lakoff [9] presents categorisation as fundamental to human cognition, a view that few will argue with.

We are aware of no comprehensive surveys which attempt to identify and classify the range of all such purposes and end users, though [5] may constitute a step in that direction, at a fairly general level. <p> The idea is to use the ontology as an inter-lingua into which and from which representations from other tools can be translated/converted as required.

Reference-contexts: Regarding how one goes about building an ontology, there are many hints, guidelines and anecdotal experiences reported in the literature.

Reference-contexts: One important issue is the generality, or conversely, granularity of selected categories. As such, it is appropriate to consider how to apply general ideas on categorisation to the choice of categories in modelling. In this discussion, we draw on work in cognitive psychology and linguistics from <ref> [9] </ref> and considerable experience of modelling using the BSDM method [6] developed by IBM. 3.3.1 A Theory of Categorisation Lakoff [9] presents categorisation as fundamental to human cognition, a view that few will argue with. <p> In this discussion, we draw on work in cognitive psychology and linguistics from <ref> [9] </ref> and considerable experience of modelling using the BSDM method [6] developed by IBM. 3.3.1 A Theory of Categorisation Lakoff [9] presents categorisation as fundamental to human cognition, a view that few will argue with. Less classically, he holds that categorisation is very much more complex than the view of hierarchies of classes with clear common properties and membership criteria being the norm.

Reference-contexts: this direction are described in: * IDEF5: [8] a language and method for describing ontologies; * a paper by Gruber discussing principles for designing ontologies [2]; * A paper by Skuce addressing the important issue of reaching agreement as a necessary step to sharing and integrating ontologies between multiple parties <ref> [10] </ref>; * A set of papers by Gomez-Perez on evaluation of knowledge sharing technology (e.g. [1]). The goal of this paper is to take a further step. We first propose a skeletal methodology for building ontologies. <p> Perhaps, the most directly relevant work reported is in <ref> [10] </ref>, where Skuce argues for an intermediate representation of a conceptualisation which is more formal than loosely structured natural language, but less formal than a formal language. He proposes a specific format for such an intermediate representation, which is to include assumptions, justifications as well as precisely worded definitions. <p> In general this is a difficult problem, and although much progress has been made in the context of Ontolingua, the general problem is very hard. Provision of guidance and tools in this area may be one of the biggest challenges in developing a comprehensive methodology. Skuce <ref> [10] </ref> has made some progress in this area. His main point is that in order to agree on ontologies that can be shared among multiple user communities, much work must be done to achieve agreement. <p> As pointed out by Skuce <ref> [10] </ref>, one of the main barriers to effective knowledge sharing, is the inadequate documentation of existing knowledge bases and ontologies.

Reference-contexts: It is largely consistent with and complimentary to Skuce's proposal. The whole field of knowledge acquisition is also relevant to this stage, but ontology capture is especially concerned with the knowledge level, i.e. independent from concerns of a particular coding language. This is analogous to the KADS <ref> [13] </ref> recommendation to produce a domain model before coding the knowledge base. 2.2.2 Coding By coding, we mean explicit representation of the conceptualisation captured in the above stage in some formal language. This will involve committing to some meta-ontology, choosing a representation language, and creating the code. <p> Competency questions may serve a useful purpose in the later stage of evaluating the ontology code and when scenarios are being developed.

Reference-contexts: Lakoff supports the last point by citing experimental evidence published by Tversky and Hemenway <ref> [14] </ref>. 3.3.2 Categorisation and Ontology Capture We considered it necessary to produce a document defining the terms of the Ontology in natural language. In other words to capture the conceptualisation. This has two roles: * as a requirements specification for coding the ontology; * as documentation suitable for non-technical people.
