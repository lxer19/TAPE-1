Abstract: We describe a knowledge-based system which monitors TDRSS telemetry for problems in the momentum unload procedure. The system displays TDRSS telemetry and commands in real time via X-Windows. The system constructs a momentum unload plan which agrees with the preferences of the attitude control specialists and the momentum growth characteristics of the individual spacecraft. During the execution of the plan, the system monitors the progress of the procedure and watches for unexpected problems.

Reference-contexts: Rule antecedents are compiled by a rule compiler into a discrimination network so that the determination of whether or not they are satisfied may be done with the Rete Match Algorithm, a high performance algorithm for pattern matching <ref> (Forgy 1982) </ref>. Rule consequents are translated by the rule compiler into C functions to be further compiled by a C compiler. 5 System Status and Overview We are now in a position to explain the architecture of the momentum unload system and how it fits into WSGT operations.

The angular momentum vector, through solar radiation pressure torques, picks up a component in the orbit plane. This is called the transverse momentum vector and is denoted by H t . <p> The other component H tz is expressible in terms of the reaction wheel speeds ! 1 and ! 2 by the relation in Equation 2 below. The number 366:8 is a conversion between the reaction wheel speed differences and torque expressed in f ps <ref> (Group 1985, Volume1, Book1, p3-39) </ref> ! 1 ! 2 = 366:8 fi H tz : (2) 3.1.2 Purpose of Momentum Unloading The term secular torques means the torques caused by slowly-varying phenomena, principally solar disturbances. Momentum unloading is required to reduce the effects of secular torques.

Diagnostic Systems The key issue in on-orbit spacecraft diagnosis and repair is that failing components often cannot be repaired.

Reference-contexts: The few repairs to spacecraft by the Space Shuttle have been accomplished only for those in low earth orbit, not geosynchronous orbits. As a result, repair of satellites in geosynchronous orbit is usually limited to swapping in redundant components. Keller et al. <ref> (Keller, Baudin, Iwasaki, Nayak, and Tanaka 1989) </ref> describe the development of a rule-based expert system directly from a qualitative and quantitative description of the Reaction Wheel Assembly of the Hubble Space Telescope which appears useful in the pre-launch checkout phase.

Reference-contexts: The flow diagrams were based on a methodology called Structured Analysis and Design Technique (SADT) <ref> (Marca and McGowan 1988) </ref>. The satellite controllers and engineers were also asked to identify the frequency and time required to perform each procedure. In addition to conducting interviews, approximately twelve hours of observations of the satellite controllers were made in the TDRSS Control Center over three days and two shifts.

Reference-contexts: We describe example systems in each of these areas. Planning Systems Planning and scheduling systems determine times when on-orbit assets can be used without conflict and may operate in real-time or more reflectively off-line. For example, Miller <ref> (Miller 1989) </ref> reviews expert systems for the Hubble Space Telescope.

Reference-contexts: The involvement of experts is still needed to refine system characteristics.

It provides an approach to the solution of problems in such a problem domain via the coordination and management of these smaller subproblems and subtasks.
