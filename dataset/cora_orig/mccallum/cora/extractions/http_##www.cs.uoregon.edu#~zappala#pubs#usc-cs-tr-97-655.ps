Abstract: Many researchers have explored enhancements of the Internet's best-effort service model that allow real-time and other inelastic applications to obtain preferential Quality of Service. However, these applications are limited to utilizing the opportunistic, shortest-path routes provided by the current routing infrastructure. To better support real-time applications, this paper introduces extensions to interdomain multicast routing to scalably compute and install alternate paths and non-opportunistic, or pinned, routes. We present a simple multicast setup protocol for installing alternate paths and discuss how it prevents loops. Furthermore, we include the results of a simulation study to demonstrate the viability of using localized route construction to find adequate alternate paths.

Reference-contexts: While their approach uses metrics based on measured delay and utilization, the formulations of their metrics result in relatively static measures that thus do not exhibit the oscillation seen in the ARPANET [KZ89]. The use of alternate path routing during periods of congestion is common in the telecommunications industry <ref> [AKK81, GKK88, MS91, HSS91, MG90, MGH91, AH93] </ref>. Trunk reservation is used to limit the use of alternate path routing under high load so that it does not decrease throughput [Aki84].

Reference-contexts: While much research has been devoted to the development of admission control, scheduling, and queueing mechanisms, relatively little attention has been paid to upgrading the routing infrastructure of the Internet to support these extensions. Previous work <ref> [Bre95, EZL + 96] </ref> addressed some aspects of the problem for unicast routing. This paper is concerned with addressing the additional complexities that arise when considering multicast routing support for integrated services networks. <p> The MORF mechanism may have a longer setup latency, but in return has the distinct advantage that it may prevent rather than just detect loops, as discussed above. 3.2 Unicast Route Setup Previous work has studied the efficacy of using explicit routing to support unicast real-time applications <ref> [Bre95] </ref>. One way to use explicit routes to provide alternate paths or pinned routes is to embed the explicit route in an application's packets [EZL + 96, HLFT94, DH95]. Assuming the route will be inserted by the sender's nearest router, no modifications to applications will be needed. <p> Trunk reservation is used to limit the use of alternate path routing under high load so that it does not decrease throughput [Aki84].

Reference-contexts: However, applications not using reservations may want to utilize route setup. For example, use of video- and voice-conferencing over the multicast backbone is widespread today <ref> [CD92] </ref>, but each receiver is limited to using the shortest path. When congestion occurs on this path, a receiver may want to use route setup to install an alternate path, yet still use best-effort service over that path if it yields adequate performance.
