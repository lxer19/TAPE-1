Abstract: This paper focuses on a deadline-based multiagent task decomposition/scheduling of hierarchical task structures in an environment in which one agent is responsible for assigning subtasks and their execution order to a set of agents. The overall task to be decomposed is specified in an extended version of TAEMS task modeling framework in which task quality and execution time are uncertain before execution and are represented in the form of a probability distribution. The master agent generates and assigns an initial subtask schedule to agents, and if necessary will revise agent schedules whenever agents make rescheduling requests. These requests are based on the degree of deviation that has occurred in expected quality and duration as a result of actual method execution. Evaluations of scheduler performance indicate a phase transition of rescheduling efficiency with respect to problem difficulty. Specifically, while frequent rescheduling was ineffective for both very easy and very difficult problems, it was extremely effective in the transition region (mid-range) of difficulty. 1 The material in this paper is based upon work partially supported by the National Science Foundation

Reference-contexts: It also differs from that approach because part of an agent's task assignment may require the agent to 1 transmit intermediate results not to the contracting agent but rather to another agent before a specific time. This possibility was foreseen in a later paper by Davis and Smith <ref> [1] </ref> in which, once a task decomposition is established there can be a "result sharing" phase, but to our knowledge this result sharing and its timing was never a consideration in any of the work on actual implementations of the contract net algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The paper concludes with a discussion of future work and summarizes the contribution of this work. 2 Model 2.1 Task Representation We used an extended version of the TAEMS task representation framework, developed 3 in <ref> [2] </ref>, to represent the problem-solving task that the master agent has to partition. Figure 2 shows an example task structure that will be used in the simulations discussed in section 4.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the concurrent execution of these alternative search paths by agents could lead to wasted effort <ref> [3] </ref>. The scheduler uses the magic number described in Section 3.2, such as 1.8, to represent the magnitude of these effects with twice the number of agents. <p> These were experimentally found to be good measures to reduce rescheduling costs. We also found that there was a phase transition in effectiveness of rescheduling in relationship to problem difficulty. Our MADS scheduling algorithm is closest to that done by Decker et al. <ref> [3] </ref>, and Long and Lesser [11], who clarified the categories of task relationships and created heuristics for parallel scheduling. Our work extends their approaches by exploiting information about the uncertainty of task duration and quality in the parallel scheduling of tasks.

Reference-contexts: This information together with time deadlines and criterion 2 Another way of viewing this work is that the MADS algorithm is another coordination module that can be incorporated into the GPGP architecture <ref> [4] </ref>. From that perspective, it extends the range of agent organizational structures that can be constructed using GPGP. 2 on acceptable satisfaction for the overall task is used to generate agent task schedules.

Reference-contexts: Decker and Lesser in <ref> [5] </ref> have shown similar results on a slight different problem where they were studying the level of sophistication that should be used to coordinate agents in a lateral/peer type of organization. Note that these experiments do not consider the cost of rescheduling.

Reference-contexts: This issue of rescheduling also relates to issues that Durfee and Lesser raised in their work on the balance between predictability and responsiveness in making coordination decisions <ref> [6] </ref>. As will be seen, our work represents a much more detailed and extensive investigation of this issue based on the expected distribution of task duration and quality. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. <p> This subsection discusses possible strategies for this trade-off. As stated in the introduction, Durfee and Lesser have previously addressed this issue in a less formal way and with less experimentation <ref> [6] </ref>. In order to study these problems, a simulation system was created. This simulation system invoked the MADS algorithm with the fixed number of agents on the example problem to get initial schedules for each agent.

Reference-contexts: Our model of task decomposition is probably closest to the work by Durfee and Lesser on the implementation of hierarchical organizational structures in PGP <ref> [7] </ref>. However, in that work, the decomposition of activities to agents is given a priori and the focus is on how to appropriately schedule the activities and to whom intermediate results should be sent.

Reference-contexts: Another approach to task decomposition is the one developed by Durfee and Montgomery <ref> [8] </ref>. They represent the overall task using a hierarchical behavior model and are concerned with finding appropriate abstractions in the behavior space that motivate the decomposition process.

Reference-contexts: It is important to re-emphasize that the task representation permits and encourages the specification of alternative ways of achieving the desired solution (alternative search paths) and the specification of different paths which trade off quality of solution for decreased execution time <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> The heuristics are almost the same as those used in the Design-To-Time <ref> [10] </ref> scheduling algorithm, shown as follows. Avoid-not-enabled reduces the score of a method that has unfinished enabling (pre condition) methods. Enforce-enables raises the score of a method that enables other methods in the future. This rule contributes to increased parallelism.

Reference-contexts: These were experimentally found to be good measures to reduce rescheduling costs. We also found that there was a phase transition in effectiveness of rescheduling in relationship to problem difficulty. Our MADS scheduling algorithm is closest to that done by Decker et al.

Reference-contexts: Figure 1 shows the interaction among the master and slave agents. This approach to task decomposition is obviously different from a negotiation model of task decomposition such as the contract net approach <ref> [12] </ref> where the task executing agents have more autonomy in deciding what activities they will execute.
