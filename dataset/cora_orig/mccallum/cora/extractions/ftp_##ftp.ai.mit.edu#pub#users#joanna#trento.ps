Abstract: This paper describes a reactive, behavior-based system that mimics a human musical skill | chord accompaniment of unfamiliar melodies. The system was constructed under the subsumption architecture methodology. This paper discusses the design task of behavior decomposition for such a system, and recommends a strategy of modularizing the minimal adaptive requirements for the desired competence.
