Abstract: This paper is concerned with defining a formal mapping from a terminological logic to an object data model which preserves as much of the semantics of the terminological logic as possible. To this end, the paper begins by giving concise introductions into the terminological logic FRM and the object data model COCOON. It then introduces and discusses a formal mapping from FRM to COCOON. Although this mapping is tailored to these two models, it is representative for terminological logics and object data models in general because it is grounded on the paradigms underlying these formalisms. The mapping consists of two major parts. The first one is concerned with mapping a concept class description of FRM to a semantically equivalent object class definition in COCOON. The second part of the mapping deals with deriving COCOON operations from the corresponding operations on an FRM knowledge base. As the terminological inferences are the most important kinds of (query) operations, we concentrate on their mapping. We show for two kinds of inferences, one of them being the classification inference, how they are mapped to equivalent COCOON queries. Since these queries can (mostly) be submitted as a whole to the underlying database system we can take full advantage of the capabilities of the associated query optimiser. Consequently, all the results on query optimisation, on providing efficient physical access structures, as well as on parallelisation that are available in the database area become usable to make terminological inferences more efficient. This can play a crucial role in realising knowledge base systems capable of dealing with very large knowledge bases. fl The work reported here was supported by the Swiss Priority Programme for Computer Science (Schwerpunktprogramm Informatik) under grant No. 5003-034347. A short version of this paper appeared in Proc. International KRUSE Symposium "Knowledge Retrieval, Use, and Storage for Efficiency", University of California, Santa Cruz, August 11-13 1995.

Reference-contexts: The traversal can be done by different variations of the common depth-first search algorithm. There are various enhancements to the algorithm, e.g. where the top-down search is done first, and the bottom-up search then takes advantage of tests that have already been performed in the top-down phase <ref> [BHN+92] </ref>. But apart from such modifications, the main algorithm used in existing systems is always the same: The sets L c and U c are computed by traversing the concept hierarchy while testing subsumption relations.

Reference-contexts: An object class is a collection of objects. All objects in the class must be of a certain type and fulfill the class predicate. Since the class predicate provides more expressiveness than any terminological logic offers (because it provides the expressiveness of the COCOON query language seethe argumentation in <ref> [Bor94] </ref>), it can handle all the representation features possible in a class description of a terminological logic. As object classes may be defined by referring to the actual database contents, they require dynamic type checking whereas object types are static.

Reference-contexts: We leave this task to the query optimiser of the underlying database system which is expert at this task <ref> [NRL+94] </ref>. Additionally, due to the structure of the query a parallel evaluation of the various subqueries can result in a further efficiency increase. 5.2 Classification Classification is the most important terminological inference service offered by a terminological logic. <p> As this database system runs on a multiprocessor system the transaction can be executed truly in parallel. Thus, we can expect a significant efficiency increase of terminological reasoning. In our current system design we so far only parallelise update operations (to deal with massively replicated data, cf. <ref> [NRL+94] </ref>), but the framework needed to also parallelise retrieval operations already exists. Future work will deal with this aspect. The original definition of the classification inference in FRM also allows a parallelisation in terms of a parallel search in the concept hierarchy.
