Title: Eliminating Undetectable Shorts Between Horizontal Wires During Channel Routing

Abstract: In this paper we present a procedure for reducing the probability of undetectable shorts occurring between horizontal wires. This procedure is implemented by modifying a channel router to predict many of the shorts that are undetectable and then place the associated signal wires in non-adjacent tracks. For the designs we routed, we found that the probability of an undetectable non-feedback short between horizontal lines in the routing channels was reduced by 39.9% with no increase in the number of routing tracks required and little increase in routing computation cost.

Reference-contexts: For this paper, a short is undetectable if Nemesis can not generate a logic-level (static voltage testing) bridge fault test that detects it. Note that some of the shorts we define as undetectable may be detected with I DDQ <ref> [Ack83] </ref> or delay tests. We analyzed the undetectable shorts to find characteristics that would identify them with limited computational effort [MF94]. We say that shorts that exhibit these characteristics are Locally Determinable (LD) as undetectable since one need only consider local circuit information to determine that they are undetectable.

Reference-contexts: An example is shown in Figure 2|assuming that an inverter-inverter short acts as a wired-AND, as it does in the standard cell library we are using. In order to collect our data, we used ten separate layouts of each of the ISCAS <ref> [BF85] </ref> combinational test circuits. The layouts were generated by Timber-Wolf [SSV85], a placement and global routing package, and a modified version of Yoeli's channel router [Yoe91]. We used the MCNC Standard Cell Library that comes with Oasis.

Reference-contexts: Results are given for over 100 layouts which show that the likelihood of an undetectable fault is substantially reduced with no silicon area overhead. Finally, we show how this work can be extended. 3 Analysis of shorts in the routing channels We used the Nemesis <ref> [FL91] </ref> ATPG system to generate tests and provide a list of all undetected non-feedback shorts. We considered only Non-Feedback (NFB) shorts as the system's handling of Feedback (FB) shorts is not yet accurate.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction For any given circuit, there are some defects that, should they occur, are likely to not be detected. Since shorts in the metal layers are the most common fault type in many CMOS technologies <ref> [FM91] </ref>, shorts in metal interconnect lines may represent a considerable portion of undetectable shorts. It would thus be beneficial to change the routing of cell interconnect to reduce the likelihood of such shorts occurring.

Reference-contexts: The layouts were generated by Timber-Wolf [SSV85], a placement and global routing package, and a modified version of Yoeli's channel router [Yoe91]. We used the MCNC Standard Cell Library that comes with Oasis.

Reference-contexts: A reduction in the number of intermittent errors. 3. An increase in long-term reliability. Other researchers have presented design rules that decrease the probability of occurrence of hard-to-detect faults by altering the physical layout of a circuit. Koeppe provided layout rules that decrease the likelihood of hard-to-detect stuck-open faults <ref> [Koe87] </ref>. Levitt and Abraham considered the problem of enhancing testability through the modification of cell layouts [LA90].

Like Saraiva, we intend to modify the wiring to eliminate undetectable shorts. The difference in our approach is that we target shorts that are known to be undetectable, rather than targeting a class of shorts 1 that may be undetectable.

The key feature of the channel router is that it places nets on a track-by-track basis.
