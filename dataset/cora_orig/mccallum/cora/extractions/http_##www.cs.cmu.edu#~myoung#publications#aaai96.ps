Title: Using Plan Reasoning in the Generation of Plan Descriptions

Abstract: Previous work on the generation of natural language descriptions of complex activities has indicated that the unwieldy amount of text needed to describe complete plans makes for ineffective and unnatural descriptions. We argue here that concise and effective text descriptions of plans can be generated by exploiting a model of the hearer's plan reasoning capabilities. We define a computational model of the hearer's interpretation process that views the interpretation of plan descriptions as refinement search through a space of partial plans. This model takes into account the hearer's plan preferences and the resource limitations on her reasoning capabilities to determine the completed plans she will construct from a given partial description.

Reference-contexts: The technique of selecting minimal descriptions using exhaustive search corresponds to Dale and Reiter's full brevity interpretation of Grice's maxims used in the generation of referring expressions <ref> (Dale & Reiter 1995) </ref>. This approach has two weaknesses. First, As Dale and Reiter point out, the approach is computa-tionally expensive, making it unappealing for describing complicated plans or plan spaces. Second, it is not guaranteed to isolate a unique description.

Reference-contexts: Other projects (Vander Linden 1993; Delin et al. 1994) produce more concise texts describing activities, but rely on simplified models of plans whose size and complexity were limited. Dale's dissertation <ref> (Dale 1992) </ref>, focusing on the generation of anaphoric referring expressions in text describing cooking plans, avoided the generation of overly detailed descriptions by a com bination of domain-specific techniques (e.g., linguistic information about the verbs associated with actions) and domain-independent ones (e.g., exploiting focus constraints within the text being produced).

Reference-contexts: This planner extends the UCPOP planner (Pen-berthy & Weld 1991) by incorporating a hierarchical plan representation. Use of this representation mirrors the hierarchical, incremental development of plans indicated in the manner that people talk about planning <ref> (Dixon 1987) </ref>. Because DPOCL is not a system built especially for the generation of task descriptions (i.e., it is a domain-independent planning algorithm), DPOCL plans contain sufficient structure to ensure their executability. Consequently, they serve as strong test cases for the generation of plan descriptions.

Reference-contexts: When identifying a plan, the speaker should describe a partial plan whose completions in the hearer model are acceptable with respect to the source plan. One interpretation of Grice's maxim of quantity <ref> (Grice 1975) </ref> suggests that the speaker must determine a minimal set of constraints that meet these requirements. To find a minimal subset of plan constraints to use as a description, the approach defined here uses the planning system of the hearer model to evaluate candidate descriptions.

Reference-contexts: Subsets that define planning problems where unacceptable plans are likely to be selected can also be eliminated. We will use a representation of the planning process referred to as plan-space search <ref> (Kambhampati 1993) </ref>. Plan-space search provides a flexible representation of partial plans and the types of planning operations hearers may perform when interpreting a partial plan description.

Their system takes a plan produced by the NONLIN planner <ref> (Tate 1977) </ref> and produces a textual description of the plan. Their system generates clauses describing each component of the input plan and, as Mellish and Evans point out, this often results in unnatural descriptions containing too much detail.

Reference-contexts: The quality of a textual description is strained when that description contains an inappropriate amount of detail. Providing a hearer with too much detail may needlessly cause her to eliminate from consideration compatible alternate plans or may overtax her attentional constraints <ref> (Walker 1996) </ref>. Too little detail, alternatively, may allow the hearer to infer that the speaker is describing a plan that is inconsistent with the speaker's actual plan. Providing too little detail may so underconstrain the interpretation that the hearer's plan reasoning resources are overtaxed.

Reference-contexts: When a node evaluates to ?, the evaluation function cannot determine if a solution is contained in the candidate set and further refinement is needed. In this paper, we will use a partial-order, causal link planner called DPOCL <ref> (Young, Pollack, & Moore 1994) </ref>. This planner extends the UCPOP planner (Pen-berthy & Weld 1991) by incorporating a hierarchical plan representation. Use of this representation mirrors the hierarchical, incremental development of plans indicated in the manner that people talk about planning (Dixon 1987).
