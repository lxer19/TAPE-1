Reference-contexts: The way the group G i arises in quantum coding theory is as follows. The quantum state space of i 2-state quantum systems is the complex space C m , m = 2 i . Quantum computation involves making unitary transformations in this space (see [10], <ref> [1] </ref>). Some transformations may be much easier to realize than others, and it is therefore important to know which sets of transformations are sufficient for quantum computation, that is, which sets generate a group dense in SU (2 i ).

Reference-contexts: We denote this pair of 2 i -dimensional lattices by BW i and BW 0 i . A construction of these lattices using Reed-Muller codes is given in <ref> [2] </ref> and in [12], p. 234, example (f) (see also [13]). BW i and BW 0 i are geometrically similar lattices, differing only by a rotation and change of scale.

Reference-contexts: H i is relevant for the present work because of its connection with the Barnes-Wall lattices. Although the original paper of Barnes and Wall <ref> [3] </ref> describes a family of lattices in each dimension m = 2 i (i 1), the most interesting lattices are the pair with the highest number of minimal vectors (this number is given by the formula displayed in (4)).

Applying p 2H twice sends BW i to 2 : BW i . 1 (large circles).
