Title: A Quantifier-Free Theory Based on a String Algebra for NC 1  
Author: Fran~cois Pitt 
Date: 39, 1998  
Note: DIMACS Series in Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science Volume  
Abstract: In this paper, we define a string algebra L 1 which contains exactly the functions in NC 1 and give many examples of natural L 1 definitions for simple NC 1 functions (note that throughout this document, we will use NC 1 to mean U E fl -uniform NC 1 = ALOGTIME). Based on L 1 , we define a quantifier- free theory T 1 and show that for any formula A of T 1 , [[A]] ~m , a family of propositional formulas which translate A, all have polysize F-proofs whenever A is provable in T 1 . Note that this work is still very much in progress.

We introduce the new nomenclature because we feel that it is more representative of the action of the function, and the new notation to serve as a graphical reminder of that action (picture the black triangle cutting into the left part of x).

Reference-contexts: More recently, Steven Bellantoni and Steve Cook <ref> [3] </ref> gave a simpler characterization of FP (which uses the idea of safe versus normal parameters to dispense with the explicit size bounds in Cobham's characterization) and based on that characterization, they gave another equational theory that captures polytime reasoning [4]. 1.1.

Reference-contexts: I studied the algebra obtained by replacing k-BRN in Clote's N 0 0 by k-Bounded Tree Recursion on Notation (k-BTRN), and showed it to be equivalent to N 0 0 . Then, I decided to try to define an algebra of functions based on Bloch's characterization of NC 1 <ref> [5] </ref>, which uses Bellantoni and Cook's idea of safe versus normal parameters to dispense with explicit bounds in the recursion schemes. <p> Remark 2.2. In a previous version of this paper, we used a weaker but more natural form of TRN without the parameter functions ~ l and ~r. Relying on Bloch's result <ref> [5] </ref>, we were able to show that the weaker algebra based on this form of TRN 232 FRANC~OIS PITT also captured all of FNC 1 . <p> The definitions follow and are inspired by similar definitions in Bloch's paper <ref> [5] </ref>. (The tuple function is defined in terms of an auxiliary function tuple which has an extra parameter specifying the length to which each value should be padded.) tuple 1 (x; z) = lp 0 (x; z) tuple 2k (~x k ; ~y k ; z) = tuple k (~x k

Reference-contexts: Algebraic characterizations of NC 1 . Based on Cobham's characterization of FP, Peter Clote came up with two closely related characterizations of FNC 1 <ref> [10, 12] </ref> by restricting the form of the recursion principle. His second characterization, N 0 0 , uses a few simple base functions and the schemes of Concatenation Recursion on Notation (CRN) and k-Bounded Recursion on Notation (k-BRN), and is structurally similar to Cobham's characterization. <p> Note that when we defined less n , we used Clote's "programming trick" <ref> [10] </ref> of making a sweep through the bits of the strings x and y, appending a 1 when some condition is met so that the final composition with OR yields 1 iff the condition was met at some position.

Based on this characterization, Steve Cook introduced his equational theory PV <ref> [15] </ref>, and proved two theorems about PV supporting the claim that it captures polytime reasoning: first, any theorem of PV can be translated into a family of propositional formulas which have polysize eF -proofs; second, PV can prove the soundness of eF . <p> The quantifier-free theory T 1 The theory T 1 which we will now describe is a quantifier-free system, i.e., a free-variable theory with propositional connectives, modeled after Steve Cook's PV <ref> [15] </ref>.
