Abstract: This paper shows how the automated theorem-proving program Otter was used to discover new axiomatizations, including single axioms, for the left group and right group calculi. J. A. Kalman's original axiomatizations of the two calculi each contain five axioms. Three of Kalman's axioms (L1, L4, and L5) for the left group calculus were shown to be dependent on the remaining two axioms. Four of Kalman's axioms (R1, R3, R4, and R5) for the right group calculus were shown to be dependent on the remaining axiom. Alternative simpler axiomatizations were discovered for both calculi, including a single axiom for the left group calculus and five additional single axioms for the right group calculus. The program Otter was vital in discovering candidate axiomatizations as well as in finding proofs of new axiomatizations. All of the relevant Otter proofs are included.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In <ref> [4] </ref>, J. A. <p> Nine new and simpler axiomatizations were discovered. One of the new axiomatizations consists of a single axiom (of length 27), and two of the others are shown to consist of independent axioms. Section 4 shows how Otter was used in discovering the new axiomatizations. Kalman also gives <ref> [4] </ref> an axiomatization of the right group (RG) calculus, in which the operation E (ff; fi) is right division fffi 1 . Six single axioms (each of length 15) were discovered. Section 5 describes the use of Otter in obtaining those results. C. A. <p> P (E (E (E (x; E (E (y; x); z)); E (E (u; x); v)); E (E (E (E (x; y); u); z); v))) (L5) There has been much interest in axiomatizations of those calculi, particularly in single axioms and other simple axiom systems <ref> [18, 13, 3, 4, 16, 22, 19, 21] </ref>. The more recent work has made heavy use of theorem-proving programs to search for and to find proofs and more general automated reasoning programs to help search for counterexamples and to help find independence proofs. <p> A job was set up starting with L2-L5, several LG calculus lemmas (L6-L11) from Kalman's paper <ref> [4] </ref>, and the denial of L1. <p> However, the inference rule for the RG calculus is ordinary condensed detachment (CD). (In fact, I first studied the RG calculus by considering the LG theorems with RCD.) The following observation follows from remarks in the preliminary version of <ref> [4] </ref>. Observation 1. If a set S of formulas axiomatizes the LG calculus, then the corresponding set of mirror images M (S) axiomatizes the RG calculus. Outline of Proof. The proof is from the first-order point of view, in which CD is an axiom rather than a rule of inference. <p> Notation. If fi is the name of an LG theorem (example Q3), then fi 0 is the name of its mirror image (Q3 0 ). Kalman's axiomatization of the RG calculus <ref> [4] </ref> is the mirror image of his axiomatization of the LG calculus L1-L5. It follows from Observation 1 that L1 0 -L5 0 axiomatizes RG.
