Abstract: Generating satisfactory routes for driving requires data about the road network and an individual's relative weighting of available factors. We describe an interactive planning system that generates routes with the help of a driver and refines its model of the driver's preferences through interaction. Results of a study indicate that it is possible to model drivers through feedback about relative preferences, but a richer description of the road network can improve accuracy. Our adaptive route advisor unobtrusively collects data on preferences in relevant areas, provides its user with a useful service, and improves its performance as it updates its user model.

Reference-contexts: We also intend to continue work on integrating the planner with a graphical user interface and use the interactions as feedback to improve the user model. We are planning a highly interactive, mixed-initiative system such as TRAINS <ref> (Ferguson, Allen, & Miller 1996) </ref>. The driver will explore routes already generated while the planner generates more routes in the background. As soon as a new distinct route is finished, the planner will summarize it in terms of total time, distance, turns, and other relevant features.

Reference-contexts: These indirect forms of feedback are less intrusive on a user than the approach in the experiment reported in this paper or the approach used in the Automated Travel Assistant <ref> (Linden, Hanks, & Lesh 1997) </ref>, where the user explicitly lists his preferences for airlines, airports, and other plan components. We are also exploring other inductive methods for adapting the user model, such as regression over the preference rankings, multi-layer neural networks, and principal component analysis.

Reference-contexts: Instead, our system induces driver preferences from interaction with the driver. We have implemented a perceptron- style training algorithm <ref> (Nilsson 1965) </ref> that processes a sequence of interactions with the planner and produces a weight vector that attempts to model the preferences expressed. We define an interaction with the driver to be the presentation of a pair of generated routes and feedback from the user indicating which route is preferable.

Reference-contexts: Since we did not have familiarity information for the subjects, our experiment did not use the familiarity attribute. With an additional assumption that sequences of familiar edges (subroutes) are more desirable than isolated familiar edges, we have developed a system <ref> (Rogers et al. 1997) </ref> that groups sequences of road edges between commonly used intersections into higher-level links, similar to macro-operators. A macro link between two intersections represents all distinct routes the driver has used between these intersections.

Reference-contexts: Besides letting the driver easily and quickly generate a satisfactory route to a destination, each interaction will provide feedback to the interface. If the driver requests a faster or more familiar route, the driver's personal profile can be updated with more weight on that feature. Unlike the CABINS project <ref> (Sycara & Miyashita 1994) </ref>, which personalized schedules in a job shop by recording schedule repairs, we intend to store preference decisions over route summaries, in terms of total time, distance, number of turns, and other at tributes.
