Reference-contexts: It produces appropriate return stroke movements over a variety of initial and final positions, rapidly reestablishes a stable gait after disturbing leg movement, and retracts in response to collisions during the swing phase. The robot has demonstrated similar performance. 4.2 Hybrid Controllers (Donner 1987), (Brooks 1989), and <ref> (Beer & Chiel 1993) </ref> have implemented hybrid controllers on their robots. In the 1980's, Marc Donner implemented a distributed locomotion controller on the 4 RELATED WORK 15 SSA Hexapod (Donner 1987). The SSA hexapod is much larger than Hannibal. <p> Brooks programmed Genghis to walk over small obstacles, back away from objects touching its whiskers, and follow people.

(Donner 1987), (Cruse 1994), <ref> (Beer & Chiel 1993) </ref>, and (Chiel et al. 1992) have demonstrated in simulation or on robots that these sorts of controllers provide a lot of functionality for a handful of clever mechanisms. <p> In our application, rough terrain locomotion was more important than implementing accurate models of insect locomotion. For example, we could have implemented more biologically plausible methods of phase locked leg oscillators, and there is a lot of work that has been done on this problem <ref> (Beer & Chiel 1993) </ref>, (Collins & Stewart 1993).

Reference-contexts: For example, the leg design presented in (Weidemann et al. 1993) is strongly modeled after the walking stick insect. In addition, a small pneumatically actuated robot has been built at MIT where the design of each leg pair was inspired by the structure and function of cockroach legs <ref> (Binnard 1995) </ref>. (Full 1993) found that cockroaches use each pair of legs differently in locomotion: the front legs are used primarily for probing, the middle legs for support and balance, and the hind legs for propulsion.

Reference-contexts: We briefly present some representative controllers in this section, and compare them to our implementations in section 7 of this paper. 4 RELATED WORK 14 4.1 Reflexive Controllers (Beer et al. 1992) and <ref> (Cruse 1994) </ref> have implemented locomotion controllers based on the mechanisms presented in 3.3. (Beer et al. 1992) successfully tested the three mechanisms proposed by Cruse (and described in section 3.3) on a small hexapod robot with 2 DOF legs. <p> They found mechanism 3 is the most effective single coordinating mechanism and mechanism 2 was the least effective. They report that these mechanisms produce stable metachronal coordination over a wide range of step periods. <ref> (Cruse 1994) </ref> describes a neural net implementation of his insect model. Although (Cruse 1994) only presents results in simulation, a similar controller was implemented on a large hexapod robot with 3 DOF legs (Weidemann et al. 1993). The simulated controller is quite robust. <p> They found mechanism 3 is the most effective single coordinating mechanism and mechanism 2 was the least effective.

The results of the Hybrid controller are mixed. On the positive side, Hannibal consistently made gait transitions between stable metachronal gaits ranging from a slow wave gait to a tripod gait (see figure 18). The gaits remained stable throughout each run. <p> In addition, they found that the robot's gait became unstable if its legs moved through different angle ranges. Inconsistent retraction velocities would cause the supporting legs to travel through different sized angles thereby inducing gait instability. <ref> (Cruse 1994) </ref> is currently extending his simulation to take into account legs moving at different velocities during the power stroke. Our Reflexive controller had difficulty maintaining gait stability once Hannibal was put on the ground. In strongly reflexive control, leg coordination emerges from adjusting the PEP of the legs. <p> This is largely a result of Hannibal's painfully slow elevator reflex, not a direct consequence of reflexive gait coordination mechanisms. Reflexive gait coordination schemes can be effective at walking on irregular terrain provided the robot has a fast elevator reflex. The simulation presented in <ref> (Cruse 1994) </ref> handles flat terrain with small objects, and a similar capability was demonstrated on the robot de 7 DISCUSSION 36 signed by (Weidemann et al. 1993). <p> As argued earlier, 7 DISCUSSION 37 this can lead to instability when using reflexive gait coordination mechanisms. The Case Western Hexapod has 2 DOF legs, so it can only perform linear foot trajectories along the body. This may have helped them successfully implement their reflexive gait coordination schemes. <ref> (Cruse 1994) </ref> intends to extend his simulation to consider curve walking. 7.3 Sensing Requirements Reflexive mechanisms rely the most on afferent feedback from the legs. <p> Our Patterned controller uses this approach for irregular terrain locomotion.

However, reflexive controllers have drawbacks as well. First, the mechanism parame 7 DISCUSSION 39 ters require a fair amount of adjustment to achieve acceptable performance. <ref> (Cruse 1994) </ref> adjusted his simulation parameters based on results from studying stick insects. However, other researchers have arrived at the proper weighting of influences through optimization techniques (Beer & Gallagher 1992), or by experimentation (Quinn & Espenschied 1993). <p> Pearson also found that 8 CONCLUDING REMARKS 40 animals do not adopt a rigid gait when walking on rough terrain. In fact, he observed a wide range of stepping patterns in which the gait pauses and shifts frequently. Progress is being made in this area as evidenced by <ref> (Cruse 1994) </ref> and (Weidemann et al. 1993), but much work has to be done. In contrast, the appeal of a patterned approach is the ease of adding new features to the system.

Local leg control consists of three agents: the step pattern generator agent, the return stroke agent, and the power stroke agent. <p> Furthermore, more difficult and varied terrain requires more sensing capabilities so that the controller can characterize it and evoke the correct behavior to respond to it. 7.4 Computational Issues The appeal of reflexive schemes, like Cruse's model of insect locomotion, is their elegance. <ref> (Donner 1987) </ref>, (Cruse 1994), (Beer & Chiel 1993), and (Chiel et al. 1992) have demonstrated in simulation or on robots that these sorts of controllers provide a lot of functionality for a handful of clever mechanisms. <p> It is not clear how to modify the current mechanisms to incorporate such an asymmetrical behavior. A typical approach is to simply add some sort of centralized process on top of the locomotion network that can override it <ref> (Donner 1987) </ref>, but this detracts from the elegance of the reflexive approach. Finally, there is a long way to go before robots using reflexive control schemes can locomote like insects over naturally occurring terrain. Typical mechanisms do not account for many of the rough terrain locomotion behaviors observed in insects.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, we added a lesion mechanism to the Patterned controller. In our implementation, an additional process is added to each local leg controller. This process becomes active if its leg becomes in-operable - <ref> (Ferrell 1994) </ref> discusses how the controller determines when a leg is useless. When active, it disables its damaged leg by putting all of its motors into brake mode and sends a message to the speed agent to evoke the slowest wave gait.

Reference-contexts: We included load sensing and ground contact sensing capabilities to each of the controllers. This information was used by the controllers to determine when a given leg was supporting the robot see <ref> (Ferrell 1995) </ref> for a complete description. For each experimental run, the robot walked in a straight line on a smooth, flat floor for approximately 8 feet (about 8 body lengths). We looked at both single gait and multiple gait runs. <p> We incorporated collision sensing abilities and an elevator reflex behavior into each controller so the robot could step over small obstacles (a complete description of these processes is described in <ref> (Ferrell 1995) </ref>). We tested how each of our locomotion controllers responded to a variety of leg perturbations such as delaying a leg during the swing phase, delaying a leg during the support phase, and walking over irregular terrain. <p> We eventually added a wide assortment of terrain characterization processes and rough terrain behaviors to the Patterned controller. These processes allow the robot to avoid cliffs, walk over gaps, handle sloping terrain, and traverse obstacles of different sizes. We refer the interested reader to <ref> (Ferrell 1995) </ref> which offers a detailed presentation Hannibal's rough terrain implementations and performance. 7 Discussion We found the robot performed quite differently depending upon which controller was used (see table 1). In this section, we discuss design issues that most affected the performance of our controllers. <p> Several of these behaviors are inspired after those observed in insects such as local searching movements, an elevator reflex, stepping over holes, walking around large obstacles, and walking away from ledges. These behaviors are described in detail in <ref> (Ferrell 1995) </ref>. 8 Concluding Remarks More and more researchers are interested in insect inspired approaches for hexapod locomotion. Locomotion control involves both the movement of individual legs as well as the coordination between legs.

Reference-contexts: Brooks programmed Genghis to walk over small obstacles, back away from objects touching its whiskers, and follow people. Beer and colleagues implemented a neural network control architecture on their small hexapod robot with 2 DOF legs (Beer & Chiel 1993), (Chiel et al. 1992), <ref> (Quinn & Espen-schied 1993) </ref>. The neural controller was developed by Beer and was inspired by Pearson's flexor burst-generator model of cockroach locomotion. This model incorporates input from a central control signal and sensory information from the legs. <p> This leads to other requirements such as having the sensory information from the legs reach the computer running the controller with a consistent time delay for each leg, and with a common time delay for all legs, otherwise gait instability occurs <ref> (Quinn & Espenschied 1993) </ref>. For the strongly reflexive controller, the propulsive motion of each leg cannot be pre-programmed since stroke length changes during run-time. Consequently, both step cycle generation and gait coordination requires continual sensory information. <p> However, other researchers have arrived at the proper weighting of influences through optimization techniques (Beer & Gallagher 1992), or by experimentation <ref> (Quinn & Espenschied 1993) </ref>. Nonetheless, our reflexive controller never gave us acceptable results largely due to robot design issues. Another drawback of reflexive controllers is their difficulty to add new behaviors. The controller mechanisms interact in a very specialized way to produce gait coordination.

Reference-contexts: They report that these mechanisms produce stable metachronal coordination over a wide range of step periods. (Cruse 1994) describes a neural net implementation of his insect model. Although (Cruse 1994) only presents results in simulation, a similar controller was implemented on a large hexapod robot with 3 DOF legs <ref> (Weidemann et al. 1993) </ref>. The simulated controller is quite robust. It produces appropriate return stroke movements over a variety of initial and final positions, rapidly reestablishes a stable gait after disturbing leg movement, and retracts in response to collisions during the swing phase. <p> Performance was improved by adjusting mechanism parameters, but we never achieved the same success as others who have tried a similar approach (Beer et al. 1992), (Cruse 1994), and <ref> (Weidemann et al. 1993) </ref>. The results of the Hybrid controller are mixed. On the positive side, Hannibal consistently made gait transitions between stable metachronal gaits ranging from a slow wave gait to a tripod gait (see figure 18). The gaits remained stable throughout each run. <p> Reflexive gait coordination schemes can be effective at walking on irregular terrain provided the robot has a fast elevator reflex. The simulation presented in (Cruse 1994) handles flat terrain with small objects, and a similar capability was demonstrated on the robot de 7 DISCUSSION 36 signed by <ref> (Weidemann et al. 1993) </ref>. This robot has a very rapid elevator reflex, so it can step over a small object without dramatically lengthening the time to perform the swing motion. In contrast, Hannibal's legs have extremely high gearing on the lead screw actuating the extension degree of freedom. <p> In fact, he observed a wide range of stepping patterns in which the gait pauses and shifts frequently. Progress is being made in this area as evidenced by (Cruse 1994) and <ref> (Weidemann et al. 1993) </ref>, but much work has to be done. In contrast, the appeal of a patterned approach is the ease of adding new features to the system. On the downside, this makes for a bulkier controller more code must be added which takes up more computing cycles. <p> From an engineering research perspective, researchers will continue to use robots to test models of insect locomotion as well as continue work in building better rough terrain walking machines. New hexapod robots are beginning to incorporate insect inspired design concepts. For example, the leg design presented in <ref> (Weidemann et al. 1993) </ref> is strongly modeled after the walking stick insect.
