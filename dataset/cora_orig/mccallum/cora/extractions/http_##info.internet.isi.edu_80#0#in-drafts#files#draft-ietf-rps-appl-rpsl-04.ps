Abstract: This document can be found as draft-ietf-rps-appl-rpsl-04 in any standard internet drafts repository. Internet Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its Areas, and its Working Groups. Note that other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet Drafts. Internet Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months. Internet Drafts may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is not appropriate to use Internet Drafts as reference material, or to cite them other than as a "working draft" or "work in progress."

Reference-contexts: This document is targeted towards an Internet/Network Service Provider (ISP/NSP) engineer who understands Internet routing, but is new to RPSL and to the IRR. Readers are referred to the RPSL reference document <ref> [1] </ref> for completeness. It is also good to have that document at hand while working through this tutorial. The IRR is a repository of routing policies.

Reference-contexts: The user trying to interpret the data is left in a confusing (at best) situation. CW, ANS and CA*Net customers are generally required to register their policies in their provider's registry. Others may register policies either at the RIPE or RADB registry, as preferred. RPSL is based on RIPE-181 <ref> [2, 3] </ref>, a language used to register routing policies and configurations in the IRR. Operational use of RIPE-181 has shown that it is sometimes difficult (or impossible) to express a routing policy which is used in practice.

Reference-contexts: The objects themselves are described in Appendix A. Authoritative information on the IRR objects, however, should be sought in RFC-2280, and authoritative information on general database objects (person, role, and maintainers) and on querying and updating the registry databases, should be sought in RIPE-157 <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: One of the major reasons is that external peers need no information at all about your internal routing specifics. Therefore, external routes are in general aggregated combinations of internal routes, having shorter IP prefixes where applicable according to the CIDR rules. Please see the CIDR FAQ <ref> [5] </ref> for a tutorial introduction to CIDR. It is strongly recommended that you aggregate your routes as much as possible, thereby minimizing the number of routes you inject into the global routing table and at the same time reducing the corresponding number of route objects in the IRR.

Reference-contexts: The syntax and semantics of the route object are described in Appendix A.3. Registered policies can also be compared with others for consistency and they can be used to diagnose operational routing problems in the Internet. The RAToolSet <ref> [6] </ref> is a suite of tools which can be used to analyze the routing registry data. It includes tools to configure routers (RtConfig), tools to analyze paths on the Internet (prpath and Meyer et. al. <p> They may be extracted one by one from the IRR using the whois program, edited, and then handed back to the registry robots. However, again the RAToolSet <ref> [6] </ref> provides a very nice tool which makes working with aut-num objects much easier: the aut-num object editor aoe (please see Figure 11). The aut-num object editor has a graphical user interface to view and manipulate aut-num objects registered at any IRR. <p> Moreover, the routing policy from the databases may be compared to real life peerings. Therefore, aoe is highly recommended as an interface to the IRR for aut-num objects. Further information on aoe is available together with the RAToolSet <ref> [6] </ref>. Meyer et. al. Expires August 21, 1999 [Page 12] Internet Draft Using RPSL February 21, 1999 3.2 Router Configuration Using RtConfig RtConfig is a tool developed by the Routing Arbiter project [8] to generate vendor specific router configurations from the policy data held in the various IRRs. <p> While you may easily query single route objects using the whois program, and submit objects via mail to the registry robots, this becomes kind of awkward for larger sets. The RAToolSet <ref> [6] </ref> offers several tools to make handling of route objects easier. If you want to read policy data from the IRR and process it by other programs, you might be interested in using peval which is a low level policy evaluation tool. <p> Moreover, the route objects from the databases may be compared to real life routes. Therefore, roe is highly recommended as an interface to the IRR for route objects. Further information on peval and roe is available together with the RAToolSet <ref> [6] </ref>. A.4 Set Objects With routing policies it is often necessary to reference groups of autonomous systems or routes which have identical properties regarding a specific policy. To make working with such groups easier RPSL allows to combine them in set objects.

Reference-contexts: The selection of routing information is done by setting the multi exit discriminator metric med. Actually, med metrics will not be used in practice like this; they are more suitable for load balancing including backups. For more details on med metrics refer to the BGP-4 RFC <ref> [7] </ref>. To use the med to achieve load balancing, one often sets it to the "IGP metric".

RtConfig currently supports Cisco, gated and RSd configuration formats. It has been publicly available since late 1994, and is currently being used by many sites for router configuration. <p> The other @RtConfig commands instruct the RtConfig to use certain names and num bers in the output that it generates (please refer to RtConfig manual <ref> [8] </ref> for additional information). router bgp 3582 network 128.223.0.0 ! !
