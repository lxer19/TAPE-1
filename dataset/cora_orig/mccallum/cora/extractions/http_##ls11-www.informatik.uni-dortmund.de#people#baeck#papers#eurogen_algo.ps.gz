The ( + ; )-strategy is presented in detail in section 6.4 of this paper. Ongoing research efforts led to the development of a variety of special variants of evolution strategies, e.g. for exploiting parallel hardware architectures or for solving multiple criteria decision making problems.

Reference-contexts: First applications of the strategy dealt with problems like driving a flexible pipe bending or changeable nozzle contour into a shape with minimal loss of energy <ref> [KS70] </ref>. This early variant of an evolution strategy, the so-called (1+1)-ES, works on the basis of two individuals only, i.e., one parent and one descendant per generation.

Reference-contexts: Modifications of the original (,)-ES have also been developed for applying the algorithm to multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) problems (Kursawe presented a variant which is capable of generating arbitrarily many members of the Pareto-set by varying the selection criterion and using diploid individuals <ref> [Kur91] </ref>) and mixed-integer optimization (Back and Schutz discuss the extension of self-adaptation to discrete variables and the application of the algorithm to the problem of optical multilayer design [BS95]).

Reference-contexts: Rechenberg <ref> [Rec73] </ref> developed a theory of convergence velocity for the (1+1)-ES, and derived a rule for deterministically adapting the standard deviation of mutations according to the measured success frequency of mutations. <p> One attempt to circumvent this problem, the (+1)-strategy, introduced the population concept on the parent level and therefore facilitated the development of the ( + ; )-strategies. 6.3 THE ( + 1)-EVOLUTION STRATEGY Besides the (1+1)-ES, Rechenberg also proposed the first multimembered evolution strategy, a (+1)-ES (see <ref> [Rec73] </ref>, chapter 9) with &gt; 1.

Reference-contexts: After mutation and fitness evaluation, the offspring replaces the worst parent individual if it performs better than that. Although it was never widely used, this strategy provided the basic idea to facilitate the transition to the modern ( + ; )-strategies, that represent the state-of-the-art <ref> [Rec94, Sch95] </ref>. In case of a (+)-strategy, parents create descendants by recombination and mutation, and the best individuals out of parents plus descendants are deterministically selected to become parents of the new generation. <p> A recombination-mutation-selection step on the level of populations happens after each fl generations that have passed by on the level of individuals. Rechenberg points out that complete populations might be evaluated according to their average objective function value, but other measures of quality are also possible (see <ref> [Rec94] </ref>, pp. 88-100). Both authors also indicate that even higher levels of hierarchical evolution strategies are possible.

Reference-contexts: In this model, favourable genetic information might spread over the population due to overlapping neighborhoods, and for this reason the model is sometimes called diffusion model. The corresponding implementation for an evolution strategy was also performed by Rudolph on a Connection Machine 2 <ref> [Rud92b] </ref>. Fine-grained parallel computers typically allow for a large number of processes of 11 Additionally, and may differ for each of the 0 subpopulations.

Reference-contexts: The (1+1)-ES is a kind of stochastic gradient technique, and the similarities to simulated annealing have been clarified by Rudolph <ref> [Rud93] </ref>. Though the algorithm is often useful, it is basically a local search strategy, and the 1/5 success rule may cause premature stagnation of the search due to the deterministic decrease of the step size whenever the topological situation does not lead to a sufficiently large success rate.

Reference-contexts: Transferring this to the evolution strategy means that the standard deviation for mutation becomes part of the individual and evolves by means of mutation and recombination just as the object variables do | a process called self-adaptation of strategy parameters 7 <ref> [Sch77] </ref>. More precisely, individuals in a (,)-strategy are equipped with a set of strategy parameters which represent an n-dimensional normal distribution for mutating the individual: I = IR n fi IR n oe i.e., S = IR n oe fi [; ] n ff . <p> normal distribution for the variation of standard deviations oe i is motivated by the arguments that a multiplicative process guarantees standard deviations to remain positive, that the median equals one (i.e., the process is neutral when selection is disabled), and that smaller modifications are more likely than larger ones (see <ref> [Sch77] </ref>, p. 168). For recombination, all possibilities as described in section 6.3 for ! 2 f0; 1; 2; 3g can be used in principle.

Reference-contexts: OF THE EVOLUTION STRATEGY The concept of self-adaptation of strategy parameters by means of extending the evolutionary operators mutation and recombination to the step sizes ~oe (and, later on, the covariances represented by rotation angles ~ff) was introduced by Schwefel, who demonstrated the robustness and learning capabilities of the mechanism <ref> [Sch87, Sch92] </ref>.

So far, no theoretical results about the self-adaptation of strategy parameters have been obtained, but empirically three main conditions for a successful self-adaptation were identified [Sch92]: * (,)-selection, * a not too strong selective pressure (i.e., has to be clearly larger than one), * recombination on strategy parameters. To conclude this description of the (,)-ES, we have to mention the topics of initialization, constraint handling and termination criteria. <p> OF THE EVOLUTION STRATEGY The concept of self-adaptation of strategy parameters by means of extending the evolutionary operators mutation and recombination to the step sizes ~oe (and, later on, the covariances represented by rotation angles ~ff) was introduced by Schwefel, who demonstrated the robustness and learning capabilities of the mechanism <ref> [Sch87, Sch92] </ref>.

Ongoing research efforts led to the development of a variety of special variants of evolution strategies, e.g. for exploiting parallel hardware architectures or for solving multiple criteria decision making problems. <p> From a pair u 1 ; u 2 U ((0; 1]) of uniformly distributed random numbers, however, one can easily generate two independent, normally distributed random numbers with expectation zero and variance one according to (see <ref> [Sch95] </ref>, pp. 115-116): p p z 1 ; z 2 N (0; 1) can be transformed by z 0 i = oe i z i to obtain random numbers distributed according to N (0; oe 2 i ). 6.2 THE (1 + 1)-EVOLUTION STRATEGY As outlined in the introduction, the (1+1)-ES <p> A choice of c = 0:817 was theoretically derived by Schwefel for the sphere model (see <ref> [Sch95] </ref>, pp. 110-112). <p> f (~x)) f select g then P (t+1) := f ( ~ ~x; ~oe)g; else P (t+1) := P (t) ; t := t + 1; and 4 An alternative consists in updating oe each n-th generation, using the constant c rather than n p c as the update factor <ref> [Sch95] </ref>. 5 Assuming that different initial step sizes s (0) i were defined, this has to be changed to z i N i (0; (~oe s (0) GC-main 26/7/1995 12:29|PAGE PROOFS for John Wiley & Sons Ltd (jwbook.sty v3.0, 12-1-1995) EVOLUTION STRATEGIES I: IMPLEMENTATION 5 Notice that the relative frequency p <p> Schwefel formulates the corresponding algorithmic rule as follows (see <ref> [Sch95] </ref>, p. 112): After every n mutations, check how many successes have occurred over the preceding 10 n mutations. If this number is less than 2 n, multiply the step length by the factor c = 0:85; divide it by 0:85 if more than 2 n successes occurred. <p> Alternative methods as proposed by Schwefel terminate the search if the objective function value improvement over a number of generations or the fitness difference between worst and best individuals falls below a certain threshold (see <ref> [Sch95] </ref>, pp. 113-114). Concerning initialization of the start population P (0) , two possibilities are useful for comparing evolution strategies to classical optimization methods as well as genetic algorithms. <p> The description presented in this section is certainly sufficient for the reader to implement a (,)-evolution strategy. More details on the realization of specific operators, however, can be found in <ref> [Sch95] </ref>. 6.5 FURTHER VARIANTS OF THE EVOLUTION STRATEGY The concept of self-adaptation of strategy parameters by means of extending the evolutionary operators mutation and recombination to the step sizes ~oe (and, later on, the covariances represented by rotation angles ~ff) was introduced by Schwefel, who demonstrated the robustness and learning capabilities
