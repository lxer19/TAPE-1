Abstract: Using a small number of prototypical reference objects to span the internal shape representation space has been suggested as a general approach to the problem of object representation in vision (Edelman, 1995c). We have investigated the ability of human subjects to form the low-dimensional metric shape representation space predicted by this approach. In each of a series of experiments, which involved pairwise similarity judgment, and delayed match to sample, subjects were confronted with several classes of computer-rendered 3D animal-like shapes, arranged in a complex pattern in a common high-dimensional parameter space. We combined response time and error rate data into a measure of view similarity, and submitted the resulting proximity matrix to nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS). In the two-dimensional MDS solution, views of the same shape were invariably clustered together, and, in each experiment, the relative geometrical arrangement of the view clusters of the different objects reflected the true low-dimensional structure in parameter space (star, triangle, square, line) that defined the relationships between the stimuli classes. These findings are now used used to guide the development of a detailed computational theory of shape vision based on similarity to prototypes.

Reference-contexts: criteria are used when comparing different pairs of objects, the some of the rankings would be intransitive, compromising the validity of the geometrical model of similarity space, and precluding the use of MDS, which assumes that the representation space in which the data points are to be embedded is metric <ref> (Beals et al., 1968) </ref>. Because the results of the CPP experiments are of the form "objects (i; j) are more/less similar to each other than objects (p; q)", it is straightforward to check transitivity for triplets of object pairs.

Reference-contexts: It may be claimed that the parameterization of the stimuli in our experiments was by construction perceptually significant, and that the best way to replicate the good recovery of the parameter-space configuration would be then to tune the model to those characteristics of the stimuli that are considered traditionally <ref> (Biederman, 1987) </ref> as perceptually salient: axis curvature, section taper, et cetera. <p> pattern can be replicated with a model based on representation by distances to prototypes encoded in the space of activities of simple receptive fields. 5 This finding raises the question whether the perceptually salient features of 3D shapes are inherently involved in any instance of representation of a 3D object <ref> (Biederman, 1987) </ref>, or are merely convenient coalitions of more primitive features (such as the activities of simple receptive fields), which may be dissolved and reformed according to a different roster on the spur of the moment, as suggested by Herrnstein's notion of polymorphic features (Herrnstein, 1984).

Reference-contexts: Use MDS to recover the psychological space structure of the visual representation set from the proximity table. In the second step, MDS is run both on the individual data of each subject, and on the pooled data obtained by concatenating the proximity tables of all subjects <ref> (Carroll and Chang, 1970) </ref>. We note that our approach to measuring perceived similarity is superior to the subjective rating methods of the classical MDS experiments.

Reference-contexts: on the view configuration obtained from MDS, in which each point represents a view and is labeled with the name of the corresponding animal, the DISCRIM procedure 3 Since no assumption (such as normality) regarding the distribution within the groups could be justifiably made, nearest neighbor classification, which is nonparametric <ref> (Duda and Hart, 1973) </ref>, was employed. 15 developed discriminant criteria for classifying the observations (views) into groups (objects). The misclassification rate was then estimated by cross-validation.

Reference-contexts: This approach has been extended recently to 3D shapes in a study that employed two-alternative forced-choice discrimination between two classes of animal-like objects, jointly parameterized by several tens of parameters <ref> (Edelman, 1995b) </ref>. The results of this study | the near-perfect recovery from the subject data of the true parametric (shape-space) similarity pattern inherent in the stimulus configuration | support the hypothesis of representation by similarity. The shape-space pattern used in (Edelman, 1995b) consisted, basically, of two clusters of points, corresponding to <p> of animal-like objects, jointly parameterized by several tens of parameters <ref> (Edelman, 1995b) </ref>. The results of this study | the near-perfect recovery from the subject data of the true parametric (shape-space) similarity pattern inherent in the stimulus configuration | support the hypothesis of representation by similarity. The shape-space pattern used in (Edelman, 1995b) consisted, basically, of two clusters of points, corresponding to the two classes of objects in each of the discrimination experiments reported there. <p> Furthermore, the deformation of the object configurations produced by MDS from scrambled-shape data was much more prominent. This finding is compatible with similarly poor recovery of the true shape-space configuration for wire-like objects in the DMTS experiments reported in <ref> (Edelman, 1995b) </ref>. A possible explanation for the difficulties encountered by subjects who are asked to recognize "unnatural" (wire-like or scrambled) shapes is provided by the hypothesis of representation by similarity to prototypes (Edelman, 1995c). <p> However, the results reported in <ref> (Edelman, 1995b) </ref> indicate that the recovery of the parameter-space pattern can be replicated with a model based on representation by distances to prototypes encoded in the space of activities of simple receptive fields. 5 This finding raises the question whether the perceptually salient features of 3D shapes are inherently involved in

Reference-contexts: Thus, the hypothesis that the human visual system represents directly the similarities among the shapes of 3D objects and not their detailed 3D structure <ref> (Edelman, 1995c) </ref> appears to be both parsimonious (in that it does not postulate an intermediate step of 3D shape recovery prior to the assessment of similarity) and compatible with a range of psychophysical findings. <p> A possible explanation for the difficulties encountered by subjects who are asked to recognize "unnatural" (wire-like or scrambled) shapes is provided by the hypothesis of representation by similarity to prototypes <ref> (Edelman, 1995c) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Psychophysical studies conducted in the past few years led to the characterization of certain basic limitations of the visual system in generalizing shape-based recognition to novel conditions (Rock and DiVita, 1987; Tarr and Pinker, 1989; Edelman and Bulthoff, 1992; Humphrey and Khan, 1992; Edelman, 1995a; Cutzu and Edelman, 1994); see <ref> (Jolicoeur and Humphrey, 1994) </ref> for an extensive review and a discussion. <p> The near-veridical internal representation of shape-space similarity patterns implied by our results can be contrasted with the poor sensitivity of subjects to 3D shape information per se (in the context of object discrimination and recognition), as indicated by a number of findings, surveyed in <ref> (Jolicoeur and Humphrey, 1994) </ref>.
