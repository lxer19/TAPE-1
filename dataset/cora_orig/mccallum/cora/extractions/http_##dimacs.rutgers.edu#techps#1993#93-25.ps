Abstract: We propose a new call option where the option seller pays the minimum price (in inflated dollars) that the asset has ever traded at during the time period (which may be indefinitely long) between the selling time and the delivery time (to be chosen by the seller). This option is the dual of the put option where the option buyer receives the maximum price (in discounted dollars) that the asset has ever traded at during the time period (which may be indefinitely long) between the buying time and the exercise time (to be chosen by the buyer). Because the settlement payoff is at the minimum (for the call) or the maximum (for the put) there is reduced regret in the sense that it is not necessary for the option holder to worry about missing a good price in the recent past (of course he may regret not holding on longer) since he gets the best price up to the settlement time. We give the exact simple formula for the optimal expected present value (fair price) that can be derived from the option and the (unique) optimal exercise strategy which achieves the optimum value under the assumption that the asset fluctuations follow the Black-Scholes exponential Brownian motion model, widely accepted. The Russian put option was studied earlier. We show that in both cases, puts or calls, the simpler option where the settlement is based on the current price at the time of exercise rather than on the maximum or minimum price to date (i.e. without the "Russian" feature) does not give rise to an interesting stopping problem and there can be no trading on such an option.

The optimal pricing formula for the Russian call option Let x; y; ; ; r; X t ; Y t be as in (1.1) and (1.3). <p> The optimal stopping rule t opt is the first time t that X t = Y t in each case. Proof. Each of the proofs are similar except for details and are similar to the proof in <ref> [1] </ref> in the dual case (1.4), except for (2.7), which is rather simpler. Since Y t #, when r = 0, clearly the short seller should wait forever and buy the asset for delivery at the overall minimum which can be no greater than the value Y 0 = y. <p> This means that V fl (x; y) V (x; y)(2.28) and with (2.23) this completes the proof of the theorem. As in <ref> [1] </ref>, the method of derivation (guessing) at (2.7), (2.8), (2.10), and (2.11) was the principle of smooth fit | which goes back to A. N. Kolmogorov in Russia and partially explains why the call option is called the Russian call option (cf.
