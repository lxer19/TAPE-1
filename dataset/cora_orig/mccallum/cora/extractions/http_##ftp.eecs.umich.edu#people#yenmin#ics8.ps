Abstract: Data integration combines data from different data sources, so that an integrated view of retrieved data can be presented to users. Integrating data retrieved from multi-disciplinary data sources can be very complex because many kinds of data heterogeneities must be resolved. Such resolution may be accomplished using translation programs (agents). With a large number of federated databases, developing and maintaining translation software for multi-disciplinary data integration can be prohibitively expensive. Also, delays in translation software development may hinder the availability of newly-created data sets. This paper describes a translation agent synthesis scheme to resolve these difficulties. Our translation agent synthesis scheme consists of two parts: a formal data set description for characterizing data sets and an agent synthesis mechanism. The data set description describes essential aspects of a data set including schema, types, units, and semantics. The agent synthesis mechanism uses means-ends analysis to construct translation agents. The means-ends analysis is guided by attribute-value lists specifying the needed translation services. An example of inter-disciplinary data integration is provided to illustrate how a translation agent is synthesized.

Reference-contexts: CIESIN will serve as a link between relevant databases and an international user community and facilitate access, distribution and use of derived scientific information in the pursuit of understanding and predicting global environmental change <ref> [1] </ref>. To achieve its mission, CIESIN must develop information management systems which support context-based information retrieval, heterogeneous and distributed databases, and "seamless" user interfaces. One of the challenges is multi-disciplinary data integration. Multi-disciplinary data integration is difficult in CIESIN's context. First, resolving some types of heterogeneities can be difficult.

Reference-contexts: First, resolving some types of heterogeneities can be difficult. For example, resolving heterogeneities in data semantics across discipline areas is an open research problem. Second, the data integration must be accomplished without using a global schema, an approach much previous work is based on <ref> [2, 3, 4, 5] </ref>. This is because the diversity in scientific data makes a single global schema impractical, if not impossible within the CIESIN environment.

Reference-contexts: Finally, developing and maintaining software for data integration can be prohibitively expensive for CIESIN because a large number of data translation programs may be needed to resolve all types of heterogeneities <ref> [6] </ref>. 1.1 Our Approach Many of these difficulties can be resolved if translation programs (agents) be synthesized either automatically or semi-automatically. A synthesis approach for generating translation agents has many advantages. It can create translation agents on demand, minimizing the costs of software development and maintenance.

Technical Report International Standard 8824, International Organization for Standard and International Electrotechnical Committee, </title> <year> 1987. </year>
Reference-contexts: The data description specifies four aspects of a data set: the data schema aspect, the data unit aspect, the data type aspect, and the data semantics aspect. Each aspect is represented using the definition language ASN.1 <ref> [7] </ref>. ASN.1 is chosen here because it is a widely used ISO standard for defining objects and protocols. 4.1.1 The Data Schema Definition The data schema definition describes all attributes 1 in a data set, and contains the same information as a schema definition in relational databases.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, the key to this solution is proposing a sufficiently complete set of keywords and structure in the context hierarchy. A draft list and hierarchy of keywords has been developed by CIESIN <ref> [8] </ref>. 4.2 Adapter and Agent Synthesis The major task in adapter/agent synthesis is to locate the appropriate adapters and assemble them into an agent with the correct order.

Reference-contexts: This task is accomplished by combining two schemes: attribute-based naming <ref> [9, 10] </ref> to locate adapters and means-ends analysis [12] to construct the plan for assembling adapters. An attribute-based naming scheme is used because it provides a location-independent abstraction for specifying the services (functionalities) provided by adapters/agents, resulting in a cleaner system design.

In our context, each service provided by an agent can be divided into smaller services provided by a set of adapters. Each service is represented by a list of attribute-value pairs.

Means-ends analysis is the problem solving technique used in the General Problem Solver (GPS) <ref> [12] </ref>, and uses the divide-and-conquer strategy to achieve its goal. The goal is recursively decomposed into smaller goals (sub-goaling) until they can be achieved by the available operators (means).
