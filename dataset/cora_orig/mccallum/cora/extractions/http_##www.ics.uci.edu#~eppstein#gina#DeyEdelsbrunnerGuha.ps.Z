Title: COMPUTATIONAL TOPOLOGY  
Author: Tamal K. Dey Herbert Edelsbrunner and Sumanta Guha 
Keyword: Survey; topology, geometry, algorithms, computer applications.  
Abstract: The authors of this article believe there is or should be a research area appropriately referred to as computational topology. Its agenda includes the identification and formalization of topological questions in computer applications and the study of algorithms for topological problems. It is hoped this article can contribute to the creation of a computational branch of topology with a unifying influence on computing and computer applications.

Reference-contexts: The extension of v to a simplicial map f : M ! N is a simplicial homeo-morphism effectively solving the rubber sheet problem. Several variations of the construction of such complexes K and L have been tackled in the recent past. Aronov, Seidel and Souvaine <ref> [1] </ref> consider simply-connected polygons M and N with n vertices each. They show there are always isomorphic complexes jj K jj = M and jj L jj = N with at most O (n 2 ) vertices each.

Reference-contexts: What is its interior and where is its boundary? A rigorous but computationally demanding answer to these questions is described in a recent book by Bader <ref> [2] </ref>. Based on Morse theoretic ideas of flow and critical points, the 3-dimensional space is partitioned into catchment regions or unstable manifolds of various dimensions.

Reference-contexts: Not all such maps have antipodal points with identical images and Ramos describes a combinatorial criterion that determines when the map has such a point. Geometric Applications. The Bosuk-Ulam theorem has many interesting geometric consequences, see for example the survey by Barany <ref> [3] </ref>. Consider d finite sets, S 1 ; S 2 ; : : :; S d , in R d . A hyperplane h bisects S i if at most half of the points in S i lie in each open half-space defined by h.

Reference-contexts: The boundary representation, for short b-rep, describes a 3-dimensional model through its boundary complex, which consists of vertices, edges, and 2-dimensional faces. The winged-edge structure of Baum-gart <ref> [4] </ref> and the quad-edge structure of Guibas and Stolfi [51] are examples of b-rep data structures that assume the boundary is a manifold. This means every point of the boundary has a local neighborhood homeomorphic to R 2 .

Reference-contexts: The two dominant types of complexes in R 3 are the structured mesh [20, 112] and the tetrahedral mesh <ref> [5] </ref>. Structured meshes. The prototypical structured mesh in R 2 is the decomposition of a recangular region into smaller rectangles by drawing vertical and horizontal lines. Each rectangle is referred to as an element. Each element has 4 neighbor elements and each vertex is surrounded by 4 elements.

Reference-contexts: This is no longer true for complexes of dimension higher than 1: there are 2-dimensional complexes with embeddings in R 3 that have no geometric realization in R 3 . Examples can be found in Bing <ref> [6] </ref> and Grunbaum [50, chapter 11]. Instead of general 2-dimensional complexes consider triangulations of 2-manifolds. Such triangulations are characterized by having every edge shared by exactly two triangles and the link of every vertex being a simple cycle of edges. <p> It is still open whether or not this is the case. The specialization of the conjecture to 2-manifolds is correct. The generalization to d-manifolds has been settled by Smale [104] for d 5 and by Freedman and Quinn [43] for d = 4. See Bing <ref> [6] </ref> for a very accessible survey of topological problems and issues related to the Poincare conjecture. An algorithm that decides whether or not a given complex is a triangulation of the 3-sphere has recently been discovered by Rubinstein [94], see also [111].

Reference-contexts: jj K jj and X = S C are homo topy equivalent. 9 The literature contains versions of this theorem that differ in the requirements on the sets in the cover, the allowed size of the cover, and the resulting topological relation between jj K jj and X, see e.g. <ref> [7, 120] </ref>. The homotopy equivalence implies that the Euler characteristics of K and X are the same. This fact has been used in [32] to derive boolean formulas for non-convex polyhedra.

Reference-contexts: The surface reconstruction problem seems to get considerably more difficult if no assumptions on the point distribution are made. An approach to this general problem based on 3-dimensional Delaunay complexes is described in Boissonnat <ref> [8] </ref>. The initial surface is the convex hull, which is the boundary of the Delaunay complex. The surface is moved inwards by successively removing tetrahedra from the complex.

Reference-contexts: Already R 3 permits a counterexample to the straightforward extension of the Jordan curve theorem: there is a wild 2-sphere in R 3 so that the bounded component of R 3 minus the 2-sphere is not homeomorphic to the open 3-ball, see e.g. <ref> [9, chapter 2.9] </ref>. Skeletonizing. A common operation in image processing replaces the foreground by its skeleton. There is no commonly accepted definition of what exactly this is. One expects a thin subset that reflects the connectivity of the foreground.

Reference-contexts: Borsuk-Ulam Theorem. Intuitively it seems clear that the d-dimensional sphere, S d , cannot be embedded in R d without overlap. A theorem conjectured by Ulam and proved by Borsuk <ref> [10] </ref> is a stronger version of this statement. Two points x; y 2 S d with coordinates x i and y i in R d+1 are antipodal if x i = y i for 1 i d + 1. We write y = x if x and y are antipodal.

Reference-contexts: Symmetrically, all edge-faces sharing the same face are arranged in a cycle describing the face boundary. The two types of rings connect all edge-faces into a single topological data structure. More general complexes of arbitrary fixed dimension are discussed in Brisson <ref> [11] </ref>. A common concern is the topological validity of a given complex data structure. Topologically invalid structures may be caused by numerical errors inevitable in algorithms that perform geometric calculations in floating-point arithmetic.

Reference-contexts: Originally formulated for the d-dimensional ball, the theorem is stated here for a d-simplex d homeomorphic to B d : every map f : d ! d has a fixed point. Observe that the only assumption on f is that it be continuous. Brouwer <ref> [12] </ref> provides an existential proof for this theorem. Cohen [18] gives a constructive proof based on a combinatorial result of Sperner [107]. We describe the combinatorial result and comment on its connection to Brouwer's theorem.

Reference-contexts: K is shellable if it has a shelling. Shelling is important in the theory of convex poly-topes. Schlafli [97] proves the Euler relation for convex polytopes of any dimension assuming their boundary complexes are shellable. Many years later, Bruggesser and Mani <ref> [13] </ref> establish that these complexes are indeed shellable. Seidel [99] uses the same shelling order to compute the convex hull of a set of n points in time O (log n) per face of the constructed polytope.

Reference-contexts: Of even greater significance than voids are cavities or depressions that extend to the surface of a protein. These are not holes in a topological sense although common language refers to them often as such <ref> [14] </ref>. To avoid any confusion we refer to such cavities as pockets, see figure 7. The significance of pockets lies in their prominent complex of HIV-1 proteise. role in molecular interactions. Proteins communicate with other molecules via surface contact along partial albeit imperfect shape complementarity.

Reference-contexts: The resulting chicken-and-egg paradox suggests that both the mesh and the solution are to be refined simultaneously or at least in alternating steps. It has been observed that Delaunay complexes in R 3 tend to contain many "slivers", which are fairly flat tetrahedra of quadrilateral shape <ref> [15] </ref>. In contrast to a triangle shaped one, a quadrilateral shaped flat tetrahedron can have a fairly small circumsphere and can therefore exist in the middle of the Delaunay complex.

Reference-contexts: The morphing of a sphere to a torus is difficult because it is not clear when and how the sphere surface should be pinched and punctured to change its topology. An entirely different approach based on the representation of shapes as envelopes of spheres is described in <ref> [16] </ref>. Both X and Y are given in terms of finitely many spheres, and the deformation is created by moving the spheres of X to the spheres of Y. Duplication and merging of spheres is permitted.

Reference-contexts: An example of this idea is the dual complex of a union of balls discussed in section 6. Another example is the automatic triangulation of a topological space developed in <ref> [17, 38, 78] </ref>. Collapsing. If a simplicial complex can be collapsed then its underlying space is contractible. Unfortunately, the reverse is not correct: there are contractible spaces that have non-collapsible triangulations. An example of such a space is the dunce cap [84].

Reference-contexts: Given the filter, all questions can be decided in time O (nff (n)), where ff (n) is the extremely slowly growing inverse of the Ackermann function, see <ref> [19] </ref>. In the same time the Betti numbers of all complexes in the filtration can be computed. Already in d = 4 dimensions it is not clear how to efficiently decide whether or not a simplex i belongs to a cycle.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm requires an initial preprocessing phase of time O (n 2 ) before the faces can be enumerated. Given a complex K, Danaraj and Klee <ref> [21] </ref> study algorithms that compute a shelling, if it exists. If jj K jj B 2 there always is a shelling and it can be constructed in time proportional to the number of cells.

Reference-contexts: Every path on X with initial point x 0 has a unique lifting on Y with initial point y 0 . Furthermore, a closed curve is contractible in X if and only if its lift on Y is closed. This was first discovered by Dehn <ref> [22] </ref>. Let n be the number of simplices in the given triangulation of M and m the number of edges forming the closed curve.

Reference-contexts: Tetrahedral Meshes. The most common unstructured mesh is the triangular mesh in R 2 and the tetrahedral mesh in R 3 , see figure 5. By far the most popular such mesh is the Delaunay complex named after Boris Delaunay <ref> [23] </ref>. For a finite point set S R 3 the Delaunay complex is unique and decomposes the convex hull of the set.

Reference-contexts: Optimal algorithms for both problems are given in <ref> [24] </ref>. The algorithms are based on observing that deciding the homotopy equivalence of two closed curves is equivalent to deciding whether their representatives in the fundamental group of the surface are conjugate. The conju-gacy problem for this fundamental group is then solved by methods from combinatorial group theory [49, 75].

Reference-contexts: This is because every such complex K has a homotopy equivalent solid that can be obtained by thickening K. Delfi-nado and Edelsbrunner [27] explain how the thickening process can be avoided. Dey and Guha <ref> [25] </ref> show that the latitudinal generators of the inner surfaces together with the longitudinal generators of the outer surface form a basis of the first homology group of M.

Reference-contexts: Vegter and Yap [115] describe an algorithm that takes time O (n log n) to construct the canonical schema of M. A not necessarily canonical polygonal schema that has the same number of edges can be constructed in optimal O (n) time <ref> [26] </ref>. At the beginning of this century, Dehn posed two problems related to homotopy on surfaces. <p> The algorithm of Schipper [96] takes time O (gn + g 2 m) to construct a finite portion of the covering space to check whether the lifted curve is indeed closed. The algorithm has been improved by Dey and Schipper <ref> [26] </ref> to run in time O (n +m log g) and memory O (n + m). Surface Homology. It may be remarked that by the Hurewicz isomorphism theorem [106] the generators for the homotopy group of a surface are also generators for its homology group. <p> This basis can be computed in time O (gn 2 ), where g is the maximum genus of any surface <ref> [115, 26] </ref>. Combinatorial Laplacians. Friedman [44] proposes the use of Laplacians for computing Betti numbers of simplicial complexes of arbitrary dimension. His approach appears to be more efficient than computing Smith normal forms, at least for some types of complexes.

Reference-contexts: The complexes that arise in the study of macromolecules, see section 6, are usually too large to even keep the incidence matrices in internal memory. We need new ideas to work on these applications. Incremental algorithm. A combinatorial approach to computing Betti numbers is described in <ref> [27] </ref>. Let 1 ; 2 ; : : : ; n be an ordering of the simplices in K so that every prefix K i = f 1 ; 2 ; : : :; i g is a complex. <p> The above algorithm applies to all simplicial complexes in R 3 , not just to triangulations of solids. This is because every such complex K has a homotopy equivalent solid that can be obtained by thickening K. Delfi-nado and Edelsbrunner <ref> [27] </ref> explain how the thickening process can be avoided. Dey and Guha [25] show that the latitudinal generators of the inner surfaces together with the longitudinal generators of the outer surface form a basis of the first homology group of M.

Reference-contexts: Non-manifold b-reps have been proposed by Wesley [118] and a survey of b-rep schemes can be found in Weiler [117]. A data structure for 3-dimensional complexes is described in Dobkin and Laszlo <ref> [28] </ref>. The basic element is the oriented edge-face pair. All edge-faces sharing the same edge belong to a cycle or ring around the edge. Symmetrically, all edge-faces sharing the same face are arranged in a cycle describing the face boundary.

Reference-contexts: Cartograms. A cartogram is a geographic map that is deliberately deformed so that area in the map reflects a quantity other than geographic area, such as for example population density <ref> [29] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The centerpoint theorem states that every finite set has a centerpoint. The classic proof of this theorem is based on Helly's result on overlapping convex sets, see e.g. <ref> [30] </ref>. Using a new approach using Brouwer's fixed point theorem, 11 Zivaljevic and Vrecica [123] prove a more general result that contains the ham sandwich and the centerpoint theorem as special cases.

The latter reference also contains a proof of the homotopy equivalence between the ball union and the dual complex and short inclusion-exclusion formulas for measuring the volume and surfaces area of a ball union model. Pockets and Protrusions. <p> The same approach fails for compact 3-manifolds because they all have vanishing Euler characteristic. The Euler characteristic has found a multitude of applications in geometry and topology, including volume formulas for unions of spherical balls <ref> [31, 86] </ref>, see also section 6.

Reference-contexts: The homotopy equivalence implies that the Euler characteristics of K and X are the same. This fact has been used in <ref> [32] </ref> to derive boolean formulas for non-convex polyhedra. The nerve theorem is also useful in computational settings because covers are relatively easy to get and through the nerve operation large and meaningful complexes can be automatically generated.

Reference-contexts: The initial surface is the convex hull, which is the boundary of the Delaunay complex. The surface is moved inwards by successively removing tetrahedra from the complex. The removal heuristic of Boissonnat is replaced in <ref> [33] </ref> by a rational and unambiguous collapsing rule sensitive to local and global distribution patters.

Reference-contexts: Duplication and merging of spheres is permitted. At any moment in time we have a finite set of spheres, and the shape at that time is the envelope of an infinite family of shrunken spheres <ref> [34] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Proteins communicate with other molecules via surface contact along partial albeit imperfect shape complementarity. We wish to give a geometrically rigorous definition of a pocket as a part of space that can be computed and analyzed. Such a definition using concepts in Morse theory is given in <ref> [35] </ref>. We present a slightly simplified version of that definition. For each point x 2 R 3 let f (x) be the minimum weighted distance to any ball b 2 B. We can make f smooth using convenient cut-off functions close to the boundary of Voronoi cells. <p> Fortunately, this is not the case and a close relationship between pockets and Delaunay simplices can be used to obtain a fast combinatorial algorithm, see <ref> [35] </ref>. II. TOPOLOGICAL METHODS We consider six topics in topology: decompositions, fixed points, surfaces, embedding, three-manifolds, and homology computation. This leaves large domains untouched, such as the entire fields of Morse theory [82] and differential topology [52].

Reference-contexts: Even for only moderately interesting 3-dimensional shapes the problem of constructing a structured mesh can be challenging. In many cases it amounts to constructing a homeomorphism between the shape and the unit cube. Meshes with hexahedral elements that relax the degree requirements for edges and vertices are considered in <ref> [40, 98] </ref>. Tetrahedral Meshes. The most common unstructured mesh is the triangular mesh in R 2 and the tetrahedral mesh in R 3 , see figure 5. By far the most popular such mesh is the Delaunay complex named after Boris Delaunay [23].

Examples can be found in Bing [6] and Grunbaum <ref> [50, chapter 11] </ref>. Instead of general 2-dimensional complexes consider triangulations of 2-manifolds.

Reference-contexts: The computational complexity of deciding the triviality of a knot is as yet unresolved. For a polygonal knot with n line segments an algorithm with running time at most doubly-exponential in n is given by Haken <ref> [55] </ref>. A remarkable result due to Seifert states that every knot is the boundary of an orientable 2-manifold embedded in R 3 .

Markov [77] proves that the question whether two finitely represented groups are isomorphic is undecidable. Since every such group is the fundamental group of a 4-manifold, it follows that the question whether two 4-manifolds are homeomorphic is undecidable.

Reference-contexts: For any given size bound the graph can be decomposed into blocks of at most that size by repeated removal of separators. A geometric proof of the existence of separators for planar graphs is described in <ref> [80] </ref>. It is based on Koebe's theorem, see section 10, and the existence of center-points in R 3 , see section 8. The geometric proof extends to tetrahedral meshes in R 3 provided the aspect ratios are bounded from above by some constant.

Reference-contexts: Collapsing. If a simplicial complex can be collapsed then its underlying space is contractible. Unfortunately, the reverse is not correct: there are contractible spaces that have non-collapsible triangulations. An example of such a space is the dunce cap <ref> [84] </ref>. Although the cap is contractible every edge in its triangulation belongs to at least two triangles. <p> Using standard row and column operations, the matrices are brought into a normal form, from which the Betti numbers can be derived. The normal forms also encode the torsion subgroups and thus contain complete information about all homology groups of K. If implemented as described in textbooks like Munkres <ref> [84] </ref>, the running time can be at least exponential in n = card K.

The foreground is eroded layer by layer, and pixels are removed as long as the connectivity of the foreground does not change. The skeleton is the collection of foreground pixels that remain.

Reference-contexts: A more pragmatic answer to the shape definition question starts from the geometric idea of modeling an atom as a spherical ball. The atom kernel is at the center and the electrons populate the region between the center and the sphere boundary, see <ref> [70, 91] </ref>. Chemically bound atoms correspond to overlapping balls. The protein itself is the union of all the balls. This geometric idea can be extended to modeling the shape of a protein as it appears to a solvent such as water.

Reference-contexts: The centerpoint theorem states that every finite set has a centerpoint. The classic proof of this theorem is based on Helly's result on overlapping convex sets, see e.g. [30]. Using a new approach using Brouwer's fixed point theorem, 11 Zivaljevic and Vrecica <ref> [123] </ref> prove a more general result that contains the ham sandwich and the centerpoint theorem as special cases.
