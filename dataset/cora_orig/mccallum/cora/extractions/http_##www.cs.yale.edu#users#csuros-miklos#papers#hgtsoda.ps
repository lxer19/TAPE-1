Abstract: We give a greedy learning algorithm for reconstructing an evolutionary tree based on a harmonic average on triplets of taxa. This algorithm runs in polynomial time in the input size. Using the Jukes-Cantor model of evolution, our algorithm is mathematically proven to require sample sequences of only polynomial lengths in the number of taxa in order to recover the correct tree topology with high probability. In addition to recovering the topology, the algorithm also estimates the tree edge lengths with high accuracy. Our theoretical analysis is supported by simulated experiments, in which the algorithm has demonstrated high success rates in reconstructing a large tree from short sequences.

Reference-contexts: Many of these algorithms strive to find an evolutionary tree among all possible trees to fit the observed distances the best according to some metric. Such an optimization task is provably NP-hard in known cases; see [4] for L 1 and L 2 metric norms, and see <ref> [1] </ref> for L 1 . This paper presents a new learning algorithm, called Harmonic Greedy Triplets (HGT), which is based on a greedy selection of triplets of terminal taxa. This algorithm runs in polynomial time in the input size.

Reference-contexts: Discussion and future research. Intuitively, triplets are the smallest structures that can be used to reconstruct a tree. Nonetheless, triplets alone do not guarantee good theoretical performance as evidenced by the recent proof that the Neighbor Joining algorithm <ref> [2] </ref> requires sample sequences of exponential lengths. The HGT algorithm achieves its theoretical performance by employing a greedy strategy directly based on our probabilistic analysis of the Jukes-Cantor model of sequence evolution.

Reference-contexts: Among the known algorithms, the class of parsimony algorithms [9] are the most popular. They attempt to compute a tree that minimizes the number of mutations leading to the observed sequences. Unfortunately, the problem of optimizing parsimony is NP-hard [5]. In addition, it is not a consistent method <ref> [3, 8] </ref> in that increasing the length of sample sequences generated by an evolutionary tree ad infinitum may still not result in the correct topology being inferred. The class of distance-based algorithms are also widely used [19]. <p> In contrast, the HGT algorithm uses a small non-redundant set of taxon triplets to build the target tree. The SQM algorithm was originally analyzed for the Cavender-Farris model <ref> [3] </ref>, which is the special binary-character case of the Jukes-Cantor model. The analysis techniques presented in this paper can be used to extend the theoretical analysis of the SQM algorithm to the Jukes-Cantor model.

Reference-contexts: The sequences shown are for 12S rRNA, base positions 81-110, omitting deletions that are common in the five taxa above. At present, the Short Quartet Method (SQM) by Erd-os et al. <ref> [6] </ref> is the only other known algorithm with comparable theoretical and experimental performance. The SQM algorithm does not always return a tree while the HGT algorithm does. <p> In light of this observation, one naturally attempts to build T using only pairs of leaves that are close to each other. The efficiency limits of such methods are well captured by the notion of depth, which we define as follows, similarly to Erd-os et al. <ref> [6] </ref>. Root depth of a tree is the shortest path's length leading from the root to a leaf. <p> The diameter of a binary tree with n leaves is larger than twice the depth, is always (log n), and can be as large as fi (n) for unbalanced trees. The importance of the depth vs. diameter difference was pointed out by Erd-os et al. <ref> [6] </ref>. The SQM algorithm uses distances of close nodes, which results in the fact that a sample of size O log n f 2 (12g) 4depth is enough to recover the correct topology with probability 1 o (1). <p> The horizontal axis shows the sample sequence lengths with the vertical axis showing the mutation probabilities. Shading shows the relative success rate from among ten experiments. recognizes identical nodes while estimating edge lengths within 2 min error. 4. Experimental results. Erd-os et al. <ref> [6] </ref> conducted experiments to evaluate the SQM algorithm by simulating binary sequence evolutions on caterpillar trees with fifty leaves.

Reference-contexts: The theoretical and experimental performance of both HGT and SQM algorithms have demonstrated to be superior to such other distance-based algorithms as that of Farach and Kannan <ref> [7] </ref> and the widely used Neighbor Joining [17] algorithm. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the Jukes-Cantor model of sequence evolution and proposes new techniques for distance-based algorithms. Section 3 details the HGT algorithm and proves its sample size requirements and running time. <p> The HGT algorithm, like the SQM algorithm, only uses distances of close nodes and has the same asymptotic sample size requirements. An example of different approaches is Farach and Kannan's method <ref> [7] </ref>. Their algorithm first "fixes" the distances ^ derived from the sample in order to make the distance matrix additive and thus possible to be generated by a tree.

Reference-contexts: The latter feature is immediately useful because the lengths of currently available sequences range from a few hundred to a few thousand only. This feature is even more useful when the number of taxa is as large as in the study of green plant evolution <ref> [10] </ref>. In addition to returning the correct topology, the algorithm also estimates the edge lengths with high accuracy.

This algorithm runs in polynomial time in the input size. In the Jukes-Cantor model of sequence evolution <ref> [14] </ref>, this algorithm is mathematically proven to build the correct evolutionary tree with high probability from sequences of only polynomial lengths in the number of taxa. Thus, the HGT algorithm enables one to construct large trees in a reasonable amount of time from relatively short sequences. <p> The evolutionary tree's nodes represent taxa, each corresponding to a sequence. In particular, leaves represent terminal taxa, each corresponding to an observable sequence. The non-leaf nodes represent the ancestors of these taxa. The mutations occur along the edges. This paper employs the Jukes-Cantor model <ref> [14] </ref> of sequence evolution defined as follows. Let A = fa 1 ; : : : ; a m g be a a finite alphabet. An evolutionary tree T for A is a binary tree of n leaves with an edge mutation probability p e for each tree edge e.
