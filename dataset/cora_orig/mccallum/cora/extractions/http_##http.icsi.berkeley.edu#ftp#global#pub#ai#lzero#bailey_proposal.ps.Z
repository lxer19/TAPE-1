Abstract: How do people learn to describe simple actions, such as lifting a mug or pushing a box? By way of a verb learning task, we bring together constraints from linguistics, psychology, neurobiology, and computer science in an attempt to discover some underlying universals in the cognitive representation of simple intentional activities. Our model must learn verbs for hand actions from any natural language in such a way that it can both describe novel actions, and generate appropriate actions given a verbal command. Our current model utilizes a state-machine representation for controlling activity called "schemas". Verb learning is aided by the extraction of salient features from executing schemas; in turn, these features are used to guide schema execution. If this model proves successful, it should should support the learning of new hand activities solely by linguistic instruction. Furthermore, it is hoped that our representations can provide the underpinnings of metaphorical understanding of more abstract concepts.

Reference-contexts: Such experiments suggest that complex activity does in fact require the construction of an overall plan composing primitive actions. The composition, though, is not necessarily sequential. Oftentimes, primitive actions are performed concurrently. For example, <ref> (Arbib et al. 1987) </ref> describes finger preshaping that occurs while reaching for a mug. <p> CHAPTER 4. REPRESENTATION 25 Concurrency For realistic behavior (and perhaps to capture certain linguistic distinctions), it is probably necessary to model concurrently executing primitives|e.g., the opening of the fist while the hand moves towards a mug <ref> (Arbib et al. 1987) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: CONVERGING CONSTRAINTS 16 PRINCIPLE: Neural networks are comprised of very many, fairly simple processors operating in parallel, exchanging simple messages, with no shared memory, slow updates, and a fixed topology in the short-term. A variety of general techniques have been developed under this framework. A good overview is <ref> (Hertz et al. 1991) </ref>. Algorithms exist for learning arbitrary mappings involving binary and numerical data, competitive learning, and various forms of classification.

Reference-contexts: The muscles then relax into this position according to the spring law. Such a system, however, faces a tradeoff between speed of motion and overshoot of the target position. <ref> (Jeannerod 1988) </ref> addresses this in his triphasic model for single joint control in which the limb is quickly moved toward the goal, is then pulled back, and then is finally eased forward again.

Reference-contexts: current schema representation may permit a Hidden-Markov-Model-induction solution using the algorithms in (Stolcke 1994); initial experiments showed this approach to be feasible. 1.2 Motivation|"It's the Body, Stupid!" Key to this project is our belief that many conceptual domains, and especially a domain such as intentional activity, are fundamentally bodily grounded <ref> (Johnson 1987) </ref>. That is, our concepts are rely more upon the particulars of the human body and the way it interacts with the world, including perceptual- and motor-system characteristics, brain characteristics, emotions, biomechanics, the autonomic system, and so on, than upon "objective", abstract representations of the external world.

Reference-contexts: That work concentrated on nouns; we apply this lesson to verbs by choosing to investigate reasoning about activity via a representation that supports mental simulation of actions.

Reference-contexts: We are looking for motor synergies which channel this freedom into a smaller number of useful motions. A step in this direction is the categorization of human grasps into a discrete set of grasp types. Many researchers have attempted this; a recent work is <ref> (MacKenzie & Iberall 1994) </ref> which further structures the grasp types using a small set of opposition primitives (pad, palm, side) in addition to the concept of "virtual fingers", in which the five fingers can be bound in various ways to two or three "roles" of grasping.

Reference-contexts: 1991; Slobin 1985)). 2.2.2 Innate perceptual biases and motor skills Since Piaget's pioneering work on how conceptual systems could evolve from a nearly tabula rasa initial state, the thrust of much developmental psychology has been to show just how many cognitive skills are in fact present in children at birth <ref> (Mehler & Duphoux 1994) </ref>. Object perception, object persistence, recognition of faces and emotions, and so on have been studied by Gibson and others. The role of inborn preferences in language learning has been considered by Spelke.

Reference-contexts: In general, PRINCIPLE: Learning to categorize sequences is hard, especially when the sequences are long or of variable length. Advantages of neural-network based algorithms include tolerance of noisy training data and straightforward parallelizabilty. However, they do not escape the following conclusion from both machine learning theory and practice <ref> (Mitchell 1980) </ref>: PRINCIPLE: General learning techniques are usually inadequate for real-world tasks. Structure specific to the problem at hand must be built in in order to learn efficiently, or even to learn at all.

Reference-contexts: In particular we believe the active nature of our schema structure can support inference via simulation, a central aspect of Srini Narayanan's thesis work on understanding abstract metaphorical narratives based on schema semantics <ref> (Narayanan 1994) </ref>. Demonstrating the learnability of verb ()schema mappings should mesh with Narayanan's schema-based story-understanding mechanisms to provide a fuller account of natural language understanding than either project alone.

CONVERGING CONSTRAINTS 12 2.2.3 Mechanisms underlying word and skill learning Clearly, children's general cognitive abilities develop concurrently with their linguistic abilities. Various researchers have investigated the interactions between these developmental processes, resulting in the following ideas. In the seminal work <ref> (Nelson 1973) </ref>, word learning is claimed to be more a matter of concept matching than concept formation. Children first learn words about things they already care about and have concepts for.

Reference-contexts: Certain verbs may not be executable in certain world states, and the system must report this. This task description extends the original L 0 domain (Feldman et al. 1990; Feldman et al. 1994) but maintains its spirit. In particular, this task is closely analogous to Regier's thesis <ref> (Regier 1992) </ref> which modelled the semantics of spatial relation terms based on visual representations. That task and ours both involve learning single lexemes from a set of positive-only examples of the form &lt;lexeme, semantics&gt;.

Reference-contexts: A canonical example of the study of bodily-grounded cognition is the color-terms work of Berlin & Kay (1969) (also see <ref> (Shepard 1992) </ref>), which showed that while languages differ in the number of color terms employed, there is a priority ranking by which colors will be chosen. The prototypes for these colors are uniform across languages, and can be predicted from the physiology of the visual system.

Reference-contexts: We might also consider how schemas can be learned in the first place, via operant conditioning, capitalizing on the perceptual and behavioral biases known to be hardwired in humans.

Reference-contexts: Both languages instead possess one verb for grip-release (i.e., let-go) which does not specify whether the released object is otherwise supported, and another verb for throwing down, which connotes use of force. 2.1.2 Crosslinguistic studies Crosslinguistic variation in verbs is investigated most thoroughly in <ref> (Talmy 1985) </ref>. A key result for motion verbs|a category that overlaps our domain|is that a given language will tend to encode only one of the following semantic categories (along with the fact of motion) in its root verbs: manner/cause, path, or figure. <p> A very important question here is, what features do classifier languages use for verbs in our domain|in particular, do they tend to be just those features needed to successfully carry out the activity? Japanese verbs draw a number of social distinctions involving either the actor (s), speaker, or listener <ref> (Talmy 1985) </ref>. Such issues are beyond the scope of this thesis; we will simply use the appropriate verbs for parent-to-child speech. Japanese verbs may depend upon purpose to an unusual degree; we have yet to investigate this tip. Mele encodes volitional vs. non-volitional status of a verb via a prefix.
