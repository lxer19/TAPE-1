Title: Topological Reconstruction of a Smooth Manifold-Solid from its Occluding Contour

Abstract: This paper describes a simple construction for building a combinatorial model of a smooth manifold-solid from a labeled figure representing its occluding contour. The motivation is twofold. First, deriving the combinatorial model is an essential intermediate step in the visual reconstruction of solid-shape from image contours. A description of solid-shape consists of a metric and a topological component. Both are necessary: the metric component specifies how the topological component is embedded in three-dimensional space. The paneling construction described in this paper is a procedure for generating the topological component from a labeled figure representing an occluding contour. Second, the existence of this construction establishes the sufficiency of a labeling scheme for line-drawings of smooth solid-objects originally proposed by Huffman[5]. By sufficiency, it is meant that every set of closed plane-curves satisfying this labeling scheme is shown to correspond to a generic view of a manifold-solid. Together with the Whitney theorem[12], this confirms that Huffman's labeling scheme correctly distinguishes possible from impossible solid-objects.

Reference-contexts: Largely through this paper, researchers in computer vision have become aware of a theorem due to Whitney which holds that the only generic singularities of mappings of smooth surfaces onto the plane are folds and cusps (see <ref> [12, 1] </ref>). Let F be the space of figures satisfying the Huffman labeling scheme for smooth solid-objects and let G be the space of generic views of smooth manifold-solids.

Reference-contexts: Cusps occur when the direction of the contour generator coincides with the viewing direction. Here the occluding contour contains two cusps which form a "swallowtail."

Reference-contexts: Huffman's labeling scheme differs from the labeling scheme proposed by Malik [8] in two important ways. First, Malik assumes piecewise smooth surfaces without boundary, while Huffman assumes smooth surfaces with and without boundary. Second, like other contour labeling work in computer vision (e.g. <ref> [3, 6, 11] </ref>), Malik considers only visible contours, while Huffman explicitly considers both visible and occluded contours. A smooth surface embedded in three-space generates a set of image contours which can be classified as either: 1) the image of boundaries; or 2) occluding contours.

Reference-contexts: The second component describes how those neighborhoods are embedded in three-dimensional space. The neighborhoods of the surface which forms the boundary of a manifold-solid can be explicitly represented by means of a combinatorial model called a paneling. The term "paneling" is used by Griffiths <ref> [4] </ref> in his informal but very accessible account of the topology of surfaces. Roughly speaking, a paneling is a set of paper panels taped together in prescribed ways.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The larger problem which initiated the research described in this paper is the reconstruction of solid-shape from image contours, a topic at the heart of computer vision. Broadly speaking, it is proposed that the Huffman labeling scheme for smooth solid-objects <ref> [5] </ref> can function as a two-dimensional intermediate representation, bridging the gap between image contours and three-dimensional solid-objects.

Reference-contexts: For each labeling scheme, there is an associated completion problem and a paneling construction. The existence of a paneling construction for a given labeling scheme establishes its sufficiency as a surface representation.

Figural completion is the problem of deriving the complete labeled figure from the the visible portion (shown thick). a relaxation process similiar to that employed by Terzopolous et al.[10] would likely suffice. 1.2 Possible and Impossible Smooth Solid-Objects The other source of motivation for this work is theoretical.

Reference-contexts: The paneling is produced by applying a straightforward procedure called the paneling construction to a labeled figure representing the occluding contours comprising the image of a smooth manifold-solid. 1.1 Solid-Shape from Image Contours Terzopolous, Kass and Witkin <ref> [10] </ref> have demonstrated reconstruction of simple solid-shapes from silhouettes under strong assumptions which determine the topology of the solid-shape a priori. Basically, they assume that the topology can be described by a tube centered on a user-specified medial-axis.
