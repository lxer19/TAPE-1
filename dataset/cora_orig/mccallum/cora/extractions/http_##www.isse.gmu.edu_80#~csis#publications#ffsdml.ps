Abstract: In this paper, we consider multilevel relations in which security classifications are assigned at the granularity of individual data elements. Usually these multilevel relations exist only at the logical level. In reality, a multilevel relation is decomposed into a collection of single level base relations which are then physically stored in a database, and a recovery algorithm is used to reconstruct the original multilevel relation. In this paper we formalize the relationship that exists between the decomposition-independent filtered relations and the multilevel relations obtained from decomposed single level relations using the recovery algorithm. We state three requirements that must be met by any decomposition and recovery algorithms. In particular our algorithms in [7] meet these requirements.

Reference-contexts: SeaView researchers have considerably advanced the state of the art in multilevel database security and the project itself has moved to a prototype implementation phase using GEMSOS as the underlying TCB along with the ORACLE relational DBMS [9]. SeaView has been extensively described <ref> [4, 8, 9, 10, for instance] </ref>. In SeaView, subjects having different clearances see different versions of the multilevel relation. A user having a clearance at an access class sees only that data which lies at that access class or below. <p> Requirement 1 Let and t denote the decomposition and recovery functions, respectively. For any multilevel relation R c , t ffi (R c ) = R c . 2 This requirement can be visualized as shown in figure 1. The proof outlined in <ref> [4] </ref> for the proposed SeaView decomposition described there amounts to proving requirement 1. Requirement 1 corresponds to the "lossless join property" in the standard relational theory. If we end up with more tuples during reconstruction than what we had originally in R c , then we have lost some information. <p> An outline for the proof of requirement 2 is given in [7] and requirement 3 can be similarly proved. Requirement 1 is of course a special case of requirement 2. The proof outlined in <ref> [4] </ref> for the proposed SeaView decomposition described there amounts to proving requirement 1.

Reference-contexts: Some of these were pointed out by us in <ref> [7] </ref>. In this paper, we take a closer look at single level decomposition of multilevel relations. Since a multilevel relation is stored as single level relations, we need two algorithms. 1. A decomposition algorithm which breaks multi level relations into single level relations. 2. <p> In this paper, we formalize the relationship that exists between the decomposition-independent filtered relations and the multilevel relations obtained from the appropriate single level relations. We state two additional requirements in Section 6 corresponding to the two requirements informally outlined above. Our decomposition and recovery algorithms of <ref> [7] </ref> are examples of algorithms that meet all three requirements. 2 BASIC CONCEPTS The standard relational model [1, 2, 3] is concerned with data without security classifications. Data are stored in relations which have well defined mathematical properties. <p> The decomposition of table 3 (c) is far more plausible. But then tables 3 (b) and 3 (c) collectively violate requirement 3. The decomposition and recovery algorithms of <ref> [7] </ref> are examples of algorithms that satisfy all three requirements. An outline for the proof of requirement 2 is given in [7] and requirement 3 can be similarly proved.

Since the SeaView algorithms are based on the outer join operation it will require greater effort to prove requirements 2 and 3 as compared with proving these for the algorithms of <ref> [7] </ref>. 7 CONCLUSION In this paper we have provided a conceptual framework for dealing with multilevel real relations as a collection of single level base relations. <p> We have formalized the relationship that exists between the decomposition-independent filtered relations and the multilevel relations obtained from decomposed single level relations using the recovery algorithm. We state three requirements that must be met by any decomposition and recovery algorithms. Our decomposition and recovery algorithms in <ref> [7] </ref> meet these requirements. In terms of future work much remains to be done. The efficiency of the recovery algorithm is clearly crucial to the query response time. It is therefore important to consider further optimizations to our recovery algorithm of [7]. <p> Our decomposition and recovery algorithms in <ref> [7] </ref> meet these requirements. In terms of future work much remains to be done. The efficiency of the recovery algorithm is clearly crucial to the query response time. It is therefore important to consider further optimizations to our recovery algorithm of [7]. Since we decompose a multilevel real relation as a collection of single-level base relations, it remains to show that an update to a multilevel relation can be correctly translated into equivalent updates to base relations, and conversely.

Reference-contexts: For now we assume that there is a set F which specifies all constraints, and we enforce these constraints in all valid instances. Since different models have proposed different sets of constraints <ref> [11] </ref>, for now we choose to not be explicit about the contents of the set F . We will state in Section 6 some properties we require of decomposition and recovery algorithms.
