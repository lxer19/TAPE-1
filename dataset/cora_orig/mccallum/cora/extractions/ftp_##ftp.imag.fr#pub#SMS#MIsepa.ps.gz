Abstract: This paper presents an unified approach to the problem of separation of sources, based on the consideration of mutual information. The basic setup is that the sources are independent stationary random processes which are mixed either instantaneously or through a convolution, to produce the observed records. We define the entropy of stationary processes and then the mutual information between them as a measure of their independence. This provides us with a contrast for the separation of source problem. For practical implementation, we introduce several degraded forms of this contrast, which can be computed from a finite dimensional distribution of the reconstructed source processes only. From them, we derive several sets of estimating equations generalising those considered earlier.

The criterion C 1 is of theoretical interest only. The reason is that it requires the complete knowledge of the distribution of each component process Y k (). In general such distribution must be estimated, but density estimation in high dimension poses big problem.
