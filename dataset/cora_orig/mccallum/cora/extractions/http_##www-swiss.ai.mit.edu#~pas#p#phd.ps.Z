Reference-contexts: In particular, it is assumed that an infinitesimal volume of fluid can be defined which is very large compared to the microscopic scales of 52 CHAPTER 2. THE MOTION OF FLUIDS 53 molecular motion, and simultaneously very small compared to the macroscopic scales of fluid flow (Batchelor <ref> [3, p.4] </ref> and Tritton [54, p.48]). Thus, microscopic statistical fluctuations are ignored, and the state of the fluid is defined as a continuous function of space and time. The above discussion can be made more precise by considering some numbers. <p> The above discussion can be made more precise by considering some numbers. The diameter of an air molecule (modeled as a hard core sphere or billiard ball) is of the order 3 fi 10 8 cm (Batchelor <ref> [3, p.3] </ref>, Skordos&Zurek [49, p.878]). The mean free path (average distance traveled by a molecule between collisions) is of the order 10 5 cm at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. <p> The flow variables are simpler to use than the mass, momentum, and energy of individual fluid elements because the flow variables are defined on a fixed coordinate system, and do not move with the flow as the fluid elements do (Morse&Ingard [33, p.235], Batchelor <ref> [3, p.71] </ref>, Lamb [31, p.12]). When the description of a flow is based on the flow variables only, it is called Eulerian. Alternatively, when the description of a flow refers to the properties of individual fluid elements, it is called Lagrangian. <p> It turns out that the advective derivative is omnipresent in fluid mechanics, and it is worth reserving the symbol D=Dt to refer to the advective derivative (Batchelor <ref> [3, p.73] </ref>). 2.2.1 Mass conservation First, the mass conservation equation is derived, which is also known as the mass continuity equation. We consider a fluid element which is positioned at x; y; z at time t, and has volume A (x; y; z; t). <p> An alternative way of deriving the mass continuity equation is to consider a fixed-in-space volume of fluid, and to balance the mass which flows through the boundaries of the volume with the change of density inside the volume. This alternative approach is found in Landau&Lifshitz [32, p.1] and Batchelor <ref> [3, p.74] </ref>, and it produces the CHAPTER 2. THE MOTION OF FLUIDS 58 normal to the Cartesian axes. following equation, @ + r ( ~ V ) = 0 (2.14) which is equivalent to equation 2.13. <p> The derivation of the pressure tensor is somewhat long and is omitted here. The details can be found in standard textbooks such as Landau&Lifshitz [32, p.45], Batchelor <ref> [3, p.147] </ref>, Newman [34, pp.50-63]. <p> relation between the mean values of the thermodynamic variables, P 0 = R 0 0 (2.26) where 0 is expressed in absolute degrees Kelvin, and R is a gas constant which is equal to 2:870 fi10 6 cm 2 =s 2 per degree Kelvin in the case of air (Batchelor <ref> [3, p.43] </ref> and Lamb [31, p.478]). <p> They are called specific heats, and they are constant within a wide range of temperatures and pres sures (Batchelor <ref> [3, p.44] </ref>). They are certainly constant for the purpose of modeling air flow inside flue pipes. <p> The above discussion on potential flow, vortex theory, and boundary layers is not critical for the computer simulations, but it is useful background material. All of the ideas introduced above are very important parts of fluid dynamics, and there are entire books and chapters devoted to their study <ref> [34, 44, 3, 54] </ref>. 2.4.2 Bulk viscosity The term of the Navier Stokes equations 2.53-2.55 is called bulk viscosity, and expresses the loss of momentum during elastic compression and dilatation of fluid elements. <p> then the Strouhal number can be defined as the ratio of the frequency f of oscillations multiplied by the diameter l of the jet, and divided by the jet speed U , St = U Other dimensionless numbers in addition to the above can be found in standard textbooks (Batchelor <ref> [3] </ref> and Newman [34]) and in specialized areas of fluid mechanics. The next chapter begins the discussion of numerical methods. Chapter 3 Numerical methods for fluid flow Except for special cases, the Navier Stokes equations of the previous chapter can not be solved analytically. Therefore, numerical methods must be used.

Reference-contexts: The left-hand side of equation 4.1 represents the advection of particles with velocity ~v, and the right-hand side represents the collision between particles. The collision operator of equation 4.1 is known as the BGK <ref> [4] </ref> relaxation with time constant t towards local equilibrium f eq (typically, a Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium). 1 Starting from the Boltzmann equation 4.1 which describes flow at microscopic scales, it is possible to derive the Navier Stokes equations which describe flow at macroscopic scales (at least 100 times the mean free path).

Reference-contexts: In the present context, dynamic allocation means to enlarge and to shrink the subregions which are assigned to each workstation depending on the CPU load of the workstation (Cap&Strumpen [7]). Although this approach is important in various applications (Blumofe&Park <ref> [5] </ref>), it seems unnecessary for simulating fluid flow problems with static geometry. For such problems, it may be simpler and more effective to use fixed size subregions per processor, and to apply automatic migration of processes from busy hosts to free hosts.

Reference-contexts: By contrast, there are also unstructured non-uniform grids (not shown here) where the grid points are "layed-out" with almost complete freedom in order to match the boundaries and the areas where higher resolution is needed (Camp&et al. <ref> [6] </ref>). Unstructured grids are very popular and very promising. A lot of research is currently being done to find good ways of parallelizing unstructured grids. The above catalogue of numerical grids should put in perspective the uniform grids which are used here. <p> This is important when a process migrates from a busy host to a free host, as explained in section 6.5 (also see the appendix). The communication of data between processes is organized by means of a well-known programming technique which is called "padding" or "ghost cells" (Fox [19], Camp <ref> [6] </ref>). Specifically, each subregion is padded with one or more layers of extra nodes on the outside. One layer of nodes is used if the local interaction extends to a distance of one neighbor, and more layers are used if the local interaction extends further. <p> Non-uniform grids are needed in order to focus the computational power on regions where it is mostly needed such as sharp obstacles. Unstructured non-uniform grids are very promising, and a lot of CHAPTER 8. CONCLUSION 245 research is currently being done on them <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In the next chapter, the lattice Boltzmann method for simulating subsonic compressible flow is presented. Chapter 4 The lattice Boltzmann method The lattice Boltzmann (LB) method is a numerical scheme for simulating viscous compressible flow in the subsonic regime (Koelman [29], Qian [41], Chen <ref> [10] </ref>). In this chapter, the LB method is analyzed, and two major results are presented: the development of a new technique for accurate boundary and initial conditions for the LB method, and the demonstration that the LB method is second-order accurate in space and in time.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the velocity of the fluid can be forced to zero at non-slip wall boundaries by imposing a non-slip bounce-back of the populations F i . However, the location of the wall is not always well defined (see Cornubert&et al. <ref> [12] </ref>, Ginzbourg&Adler [21] for a discussion of the actual location of the wall as a function of the simulation parameters for some simple flows). <p> However, the exact location of the wall is not known, and may vary with the flow conditions near the boundary (Cornubert&et al. <ref> [12] </ref>, Ginzbourg&Adler [21]). Regarding the CHAPTER 4. THE LATTICE BOLTZMANN METHOD 174 density, the calculation of density at the wall is not an issue because there are no fluid nodes located on the non-slip wall.

Reference-contexts: The condition of zero vorticity enables us to write the velocity field as the gradient of a scalar potential function. For example, in two dimensions, the condition of zero vorticity implies that @V y = @y This is the condition of integrability for an exact differential (Courant <ref> [13, p.353] </ref>), d = V x dx + V y dy (2.63) Therefore, the scalar potential function can be introduced in place of the vector velocity. <p> The above equation shows that the vorticity remains always zero. Thus, the following condition of integrability is satisfied (Courant <ref> [13, p.353] </ref>), d = u dx + v dy (2.92) and the acoustic velocity is the gradient of a scalar potential function, denoted here by . The above acoustic potential is a special case of the general potential model (zero vorticity approximation) that is discussed in section 2.4.1. <p> THE MOTION OF FLUIDS 85 the wave equation is linear, any superposition of solutions is also a solution. In particular, the complex exponentials that satisfy the wave equation can be used to represent almost any solution as a sum (integral) of complex exponentials according to Fourier's decomposition theorem (Courant <ref> [13, p.318] </ref>). The complex exponentials that satisfy the wave equation are as follows, u (x; y; t) = e i (k x ! t) (2.102) The above complex exponential is a periodic traveling wave that advances in the positive x direction with increasing time.

Reference-contexts: The CFL condition must be satisfied in order to be able to simulate the physical phenomenon. In the case of simple hyperbolic problems (such as the wave equation), it can be shown that the CFL condition is also a necessary condition for the stability of explicit methods (Courant&et al. <ref> [14] </ref>). The CFL condition can be written approximately as follows, x c s (3.1) CHAPTER 3. NUMERICAL METHODS FOR FLUID FLOW 111 where c s is the propagation speed of acoustic waves.

Reference-contexts: The key ingredients that make the kinetic approach work, are the advection of particles and the collision of particles (relaxation) conserving mass, momentum, and energy. An additional feature is that the discrete set of velocities requires a highly-symmetric lattice (grid) on which the particles can move <ref> [20, 15, 58] </ref>. 1 More complex collision operators can be used also to describe 2-pair, 3-pair, etc interactions between particles (this leads to the BBGKY hierarchy of equations [27, p.65]).

Reference-contexts: PARALLEL COMPUTING 207 restarting; except, only the state of the migrating process is saved on disk. In contrast to this simple migration mechanism, the migration of processes is a challenging task in a general computing environment such as a distributed operating system <ref> [16] </ref>. In the present system, the migration task has been simplified because the parallel processes have been designed appropriately to accommodate migration easily. 6.5.2 Sharing the network and file server A related issue to sharing the workstations with other users, is the sharing of the network and the file server.

Reference-contexts: Further, we may observe that the number of velocity directions at each lattice node is a small number for the lattice Boltzmann method (to reduce computer memory requirements), while it varies from small to large for lattice gas methods. This is important because it has been reported <ref> [17] </ref> that lattice gas methods with a large number of velocity directions are more flexible and closer to correct hydrodynamics than lattice gas methods with a very small number of velocity directions.

Reference-contexts: Second-order convergence in space means that the error decreases quadratically with x while keeping the dimensionless ratio t -=x 2 constant (Fletcher <ref> [18, p.75] </ref>). Second-order convergence in time means that the error decreases quadratically with t while keeping the space discretization x constant. Furthermore, we are interested in the true discretization error and not the error that arises from compressibility. <p> Peyret&Taylor [38, p.323] report that high-frequency oscillations appear both in explicit and implicit methods for transonic and supersonic compressible flow, which hints that there may be a physical cause that triggers the oscillations. It has been conjectured (Fletcher <ref> [18, p.438] </ref> and elsewhere) that physical turbulence may be triggering the numerical oscillations. Turbulent flow produces high frequency disturbances whose wavelength is much smaller than the limited resolution of computer simulations.

Reference-contexts: I also develop a model of parallel efficiency in section 6.8, which is based on simple ideas that have been discussed previously, for example in Fox et al. <ref> [19] </ref> and elsewhere. I compare the predictions of this model against real measurements of the parallel efficiency. Regarding the problem of using non-dedicated workstations, I handle this problem by employing automatic process migration from busy hosts to free hosts. <p> This is important when a process migrates from a busy host to a free host, as explained in section 6.5 (also see the appendix). The communication of data between processes is organized by means of a well-known programming technique which is called "padding" or "ghost cells" (Fox <ref> [19] </ref>, Camp [6]).

Moreover, the wave equation can be linearized, and can be solved using analytic approximations (Green function integrals, for example) avoiding the cost of a direct numerical solution. The incompressible flow approximation is a good idea when the propagation of acoustic waves does not influence the dynamics of the phenomenon. <p> For example, Ohring [35] has simulated jets of air impinging on a sharp triangular wedge using an incompressible flow calculation. Peters [37] has employed vortex methods to simulate the initial stages of blowing air through a flue channel and also the flow of gas through industrial pipe systems. Harding <ref> [24] </ref> has used an incompressible flow calculation as a source term to a wave equation in order to study the sound generated by an obstruction inside a channel.

Reference-contexts: The acoustic waves interact with the jet so that the jet oscillates at frequencies near the resonant frequencies of the pipe. Exactly how this happens is not known (section 7.2), but simple models have been proposed (Verge94 [57, 56], Hirschberg <ref> [26] </ref>). It would CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 30 1104 cm/s.

The success of the potential model in these situations depends on CHAPTER 2. THE MOTION OF FLUIDS 74 having a good understanding of the flow in order to make the right assumptions and the right approximations. <p> Therefore, near the source the wave amplitude is large, and nonlinear effects can be very important, as in the case of the air jet in a flue pipe. Nonlinear effects are the basic mechanism for amplification of sound in flue pipes (Verge94 [56], Hirschberg94 <ref> [26] </ref>). Having discussed the limitations of linear acoustic theory in this section, the question arises whether it is reasonable to try to distinguish acoustic waves from other variations of density in nonlinear regimes. <p> PARALLEL COMPUTING 197 from the acoustic waves to the jet. Similar phenomena occur in human whistling and in voicing of fricative consonants (Shadle [46]). Although sound-producing jets have been studied for more than a hundred years, they remain the subject of active research (Verge94 [57, 56], Hirschberg <ref> [26] </ref>) because they are very complex. The parallel system presented herein can easily simulate flue pipes using uniform orthogonal grids as large as 1200 fi 1200 in two dimensions (1:5 million nodes) and even larger. <p> Such a reduction introduces a number of parameters which are adjusted to fit the observed results of a particular flue pipe (Verge94 [57, 56], Hirschberg <ref> [26] </ref>). Considerable success has been reported with some reduced models of flue pipes, but the subject still has a long way to go. For example, the assumptions of the reduced models are not agreed upon by everyone, and they are not completely understood. <p> Furthermore, the frequencies of an edge tone are approximately proportional to the blowing speed, and inversely proportional to the distance between the jet's orifice and the obstacle. An experimental formula is as follows (Hirschberg <ref> [26, p.210] </ref>), V where f is the frequency in Hz, V is the mean speed of the jet in cm/s, and fl is a small correction 0 fl 0:5. <p> A rise time of 3 ms is used in all the simulations presented here, which is relatively fast but not unusual CHAPTER 7.

Reference-contexts: The conservation properties are so powerful that one can derive the Navier Stokes equations by imposing conservation at the microscopic level, and by performing macroscopic averaging of the microscopic dynamics (Huang <ref> [27] </ref>). Such a derivation is called the kinetic theory approach. A simplified version of kinetic theory can be found in section 4.1.2, where it is shown that the lattice Boltzmann method approximates the Navier Stokes equations through a kinetic theory expansion known as the Chapman CHAPTER 2. <p> An additional feature is that the discrete set of velocities requires a highly-symmetric lattice (grid) on which the particles can move [20, 15, 58]. 1 More complex collision operators can be used also to describe 2-pair, 3-pair, etc interactions between particles (this leads to the BBGKY hierarchy of equations <ref> [27, p.65] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The flow variables are simpler to use than the mass, momentum, and energy of individual fluid elements because the flow variables are defined on a fixed coordinate system, and do not move with the flow as the fluid elements do (Morse&Ingard [33, p.235], Batchelor [3, p.71], Lamb <ref> [31, p.12] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: An alternative way of deriving the mass continuity equation is to consider a fixed-in-space volume of fluid, and to balance the mass which flows through the boundaries of the volume with the change of density inside the volume. This alternative approach is found in Landau&Lifshitz <ref> [32, p.1] </ref> and Batchelor [3, p.74], and it produces the CHAPTER 2. THE MOTION OF FLUIDS 58 normal to the Cartesian axes. following equation, @ + r ( ~ V ) = 0 (2.14) which is equivalent to equation 2.13. <p> The derivation of the pressure tensor is somewhat long and is omitted here. The details can be found in standard textbooks such as Landau&Lifshitz <ref> [32, p.45] </ref>, Batchelor [3, p.147], Newman [34, pp.50-63]. <p> It turns out that the adiabatic approximation applies more generally to any variations of density in subsonic flow as long as the variations are small. The reason is as follows. Let us consider a steady flow inside a pipe (Hagen-Poiseuille flow, Landau&Lifshitz <ref> [32, p.51] </ref>), and let us ask whether the relation between pressure and density variations P = c 2 s still applies. The answer is yes, and the adiabatic law still applies because what is important is how the state of equilibrium is reached. <p> THE MOTION OF FLUIDS 70 speed is large, the vortex may separate and move away with the flow, while new vortices are being formed in its place. layer to grow from an initial non-moving state. An example of this situation is the Hagen-Poiseuille flow (Newman [34, p.63-85], Landau&Lifshitz <ref> [32, p.51] </ref>) inside long pipes, where the velocity assumes a parabolic profile eventually, and the boundary layer can be considered to extend the radius of the pipe. <p> Another way of understanding the incompressible flow approximation is to consider the following situation which appears paradoxical at first sight. A solution of the incompressible flow equations is steady flow inside long pipes, known as Hagen-Poiseuille flow (Landau&Lifshitz <ref> [32, p.51] </ref>). Let us consider a two-dimensional pipe with the walls located at y = 1 and y = 0, and let us assume a constant pressure gradient along x, @P = s @ = constant (2.72) where the adiabatic relation between pressure and density is used. <p> An acoustic wave in a compressible medium is usually defined as an oscillatory motion of small amplitude <ref> [32, p.251] </ref>. The oscillation arises through the interchange of energy between the kinetic and the potential forms; namely, the velocity and the density (pressure) of the compressible medium. <p> The effect of heat transfer with the walls is ignored by the adiabatic model of sound which assumes no heat transfer. Thermal effects are discussed in Kittel&Kroemer [28, p.434]. Transverse friction in combination with thermal effects are discussed in Landau&Lifshitz <ref> [32, p.301] </ref>, and also Morse&Ingard [33, p.286]. 2.5.3 Shear waves This section analyzes shear waves which are transverse waves as opposed to the longitudinal waves of the previous section. These shear waves are another solution of the dissipative wave equations 2.112-2.114. They are not proper acoustic waves how CHAPTER 2. <p> In particular, for the purpose of numerical testing it is convenient to impose two boundary conditions: a non-moving wall at y = 0, and an oscillating plate at y = 1. We can satisfy these boundary conditions (Landau&Lifshitz <ref> [32, p.45] </ref>) if we constrain the general shear CHAPTER 2. <p> The choice of characteristic scales is somewhat arbitrary, and it depends on the geometry of the flow, and on which features we choose to focus on. For example, in the case of flow CHAPTER 2. THE MOTION OF FLUIDS 104 through a pipe (Hagen-Poiseuille flow, Landau&Lifshitz <ref> [32, p.51] </ref>), the length l is typically chosen to be the diameter of the pipe, and the speed U is chosen to be the mean speed of the flow. <p> Actually, a more stringent bound can be obtained by considering the formula for the bulk viscosity, = 2-(1 3w 0 6y 0 ) (4.23) The second law of thermodynamics applied to the dissipation of energy during the compression of fluid elements (Landau&Lifshitz <ref> [32, p.45] </ref>) requires that 3 which gives w 0 + 2y 0 18 or using the choice y 0 = w 0 =4, w 0 27 The above formulas are necessary conditions for the stability of the lattice Boltzmann method. 4.2 Initial and boundary conditions Having reviewed the basic theory of <p> communicate 3 variables per fluid node. 6.7 Experimental measurements of performance The performance of the parallel simulation system has been measured when using the finite difference method and the lattice Boltzmann method to simulate a well-known problem in fluid mechanics, Hagen-Poiseuille flow through a rectangular channel (Sko-rdos [48] and Landau&Lifshitz <ref> [32, p.51] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Occasionally, macroscopic fluid dynamics (the Navier Stokes equations) are employed at length scales as small as the mean free path, for example, in ultrasonic acoustics (Morse&Ingard <ref> [33] </ref>).

The details can be found in standard textbooks such as Landau&Lifshitz [32, p.45], Batchelor [3, p.147], Newman <ref> [34, pp.50-63] </ref>. <p> Generally, the term is responsible for smoothing and diffusing differences in the velocity of the fluid. An important property of viscous fluids is that when the coefficient is very small, the deceleration of the fluid due to viscosity occurs in small regions that are called boundary layers (Newman <ref> [34, pp.70-68] </ref>). Inside a boundary layer the flow velocity changes very rapidly from one value to another, which makes the velocity gradients very large, and thus the term of the Navier Stokes equations large enough that it can not be neglected. <p> THE MOTION OF FLUIDS 70 speed is large, the vortex may separate and move away with the flow, while new vortices are being formed in its place. layer to grow from an initial non-moving state. An example of this situation is the Hagen-Poiseuille flow (Newman <ref> [34, p.63-85] </ref>, Landau&Lifshitz [32, p.51]) inside long pipes, where the velocity assumes a parabolic profile eventually, and the boundary layer can be considered to extend the radius of the pipe. <p> Also, the fluid is assumed to be initially at rest so that the vorticity is initially zero. Then, according to Kelvin's circulation theorem for inviscid flows, the integral of vorticity remains constant in time over any CHAPTER 2. THE MOTION OF FLUIDS 73 simply-connected surface of the flow (Newman <ref> [34, p.105] </ref>). Physically, this means (Tritton [54] p.84 and p.114) that if the vorticity is initially zero, it will always remain zero. Of course, the viscosity can not be neglected in boundary layers where the velocity gradient is large. <p> The scalar potential function is very useful because it enables us to calculate analytically the solutions of many flow geometries (see chapter 4 of Newman's book <ref> [34] </ref>) especially in two dimensions. Because of its versatility in finding analytic solutions, the potential approximation is used very widely, even when there is a lot of vorticity in the flow, and the inviscid assumption is very questionable. <p> Using such techniques, the effect of boundary layers, and also the effect of unsteady generation of vorticity can be handled within the framework of a potential model (chapter 4 of Newman's book <ref> [34] </ref>). The potential model is also useful in situations which are too complex to analyze otherwise, and the potential model provides at least one estimate of the behavior of the flow. <p> The above discussion on potential flow, vortex theory, and boundary layers is not critical for the computer simulations, but it is useful background material. All of the ideas introduced above are very important parts of fluid dynamics, and there are entire books and chapters devoted to their study <ref> [34, 44, 3, 54] </ref>. 2.4.2 Bulk viscosity The term of the Navier Stokes equations 2.53-2.55 is called bulk viscosity, and expresses the loss of momentum during elastic compression and dilatation of fluid elements. <p> Therefore, it can be absorbed in the velocity potential without affecting the spatial gradient. For example, we can redefine the potential as follows (for a related problem see Newman <ref> [34, p.108] </ref>), 0 = + C (t ) dt (2.98) but we keep the same symbol below for simplicity. <p> Regarding the density, the units of mass are normalized by 0:0012 gm=cm 3 so that the mean density is unity. Table 2.2 lists typical values of the mean density and the kinematic viscosity of air at room temperatures and atmospheric pressure. These values are taken from Newman <ref> [34, p.388] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The traditional approach of simulating subsonic flow is to approximate the sub-sonic flow with a perfectly incompressible flow, as defined in section 2.4.3. The incompressible flow approximation ignores the propagation of acoustic waves (it assumes infinitely fast propagation), and allows the use of large integration time steps (Peyret&Taylor <ref> [38] </ref>). Such an approach is valid when the acoustic waves play a secondary role from a physical point of view: for example, when the time-scale of CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 16 acoustic waves does not influence the main flow, and when we are not interested in the generation of acoustic waves. <p> It is common practice to use the following value, = 3 which is called the Stokes' relation and corresponds to setting the second coefficient of viscosity equal to zero = 0 in equation 2.51 (Peyret&Taylor <ref> [38, p.11] </ref> and Tritton [54, p.58]). In the case of subsonic flow, the term is often omitted because the gradient of the divergence of velocity is very small compared to the other terms of the momentum Navier Stokes equations (see below). <p> For example, the fluid velocity can be defined halfway between the grid nodes, and the fluid density can be defined exactly at the grid nodes. This staggered allocation of variables has advantages in some cases (Peyret&Taylor <ref> [38] </ref>), CHAPTER 3. NUMERICAL METHODS FOR FLUID FLOW 107 but it is more complex to deal with than a straightforward non-staggered grid where all the variables are defined at the grid nodes. In the present work, non-staggered grids are employed exclusively. Numerical grids can be distinguished into uniform or non-uniform. <p> An alternative to coordinate transformations is to discretize the Navier Stokes CHAPTER 3. NUMERICAL METHODS FOR FLUID FLOW 108 equations directly in the physical space by taking finite differences based on the local spacings around each grid point (Peyret&Taylor <ref> [38, p.326] </ref>). Direct discretization in the physical space is typically used in the case of non-uniform orthogonal grids, and also in the case of unstructured non-uniform grids described below. Both the curvilinear and the non-uniform orthogonal grids of figure 3-1 are well-structured grids. <p> By this, I do not mean semi-implicit methods where some terms of the Navier-Stokes equations are discretized implicitly and others explicitly. Also, I do not mean "alternating directions" (Peyret&Taylor <ref> [38] </ref>) where the matrix equation is split into smaller matrices that are solved in succession: first along the x-direction, then along the y-direction, then along the z-direction. <p> Another difficulty in trying to interpret the CFL condition in the context of implicit methods is that many implicit methods are known to be unconditionally stable (Peyret&Taylor <ref> [38] </ref>) under linear stability analysis. Therefore, such methods can compute a stable solution (though not necessarily accurate or correct) even when the time step t is much larger than the CFL limit. All this shows that the CFL condition is inconclusive in the case of implicit methods. <p> Another stability condition that takes into account viscous effects can be derived as follows. We consider the linear advection-diffusion equation (Peyret&Taylor <ref> [38, p.65] </ref>) which is simple to analyze, and is a special case of the momentum Navier Stokes equations. The advection-diffusion equation has the following form, @f + A @x @f -r 2 f = 0 (3.16) where f is the variable that is diffused; for example, the fluid momentum. <p> NUMERICAL METHODS FOR FLUID FLOW 115 description), we get the following constraints (Peyret&Taylor <ref> [38, p.65] </ref>) in the case of x = y, 2 and also, -t 1 (3.19) Although the above conditions are necessary, they are not sufficient. The simulation of subsonic compressible flow at high Reynolds numbers is susceptible to slow-growing numerical instabilities of very high spatial frequency. <p> To compare, an explicit discretization is as follows, n+1 = n t n u n j1 + u n n j1 # We now apply the von-Neumann frequency analysis (Peyret&Taylor <ref> [38, p.344] </ref>). We write the different variables in terms of their frequency components, and we analyze each frequency separately (non-linear combinations of frequencies are ignored). <p> Accordingly, this method is called a projection method. The projection takes into account the pressure effects that were omitted in the first estimate of the velocity (Peyret&Taylor <ref> [38, p.160] </ref>). In addition, the solution of the Poisson equation provides an estimate of the pressure at the current time-step as follows, P = t In the numerical tests of sections 4.4 and 4.5, the Poisson equation is solved with Successive-Over-Relaxation (SOR) [40, page 680] using an orthogonal non-staggered grid. <p> In the case of boundary conditions with non-zero velocity, such as the driven cavity problem Peyret&Taylor <ref> [38, p.199] </ref>, the velocity at the boundary can be controlled by inserting momentum (forcing) in every step as is done in lattice gas automata. This type of forcing is somewhat ad-hoc however, and is often inaccurate, and requires recalibration of the simulation parameters. <p> In practice, however, the velocity gradients at the boundary nodes are usually not known. For example, the gradient @V x =@y at the top and bottom walls of the driven cavity problem (not reported here but see Peyret&Taylor <ref> [38, p.199] </ref>) can not be specified because it is part of the solution that we seek to compute. When a velocity gradient can not be specified, finite differences must be used to estimate it. In the experiments below, different ways of specifying the velocity gradients at the boundary are tested. <p> CHAPTER 4. THE LATTICE BOLTZMANN METHOD 171 P is specified from the requirement @P=@n = 0 at the boundary, where @n denotes the direction normal to the boundary (Peyret&Taylor <ref> [38, p.160] </ref>). <p> Such a filter must be used both with the lattice Boltzmann method and with the compressible finite difference method of section 3.3 for flows with high Reynolds number. Similar types of artificial-viscosity filters have been traditionally used in simulations of supersonic and transonic flow (Peyret&Taylor <ref> [38] </ref>). The idea of artificial-viscosity filters goes back to Richtmeyer&Morton [43] and perhaps earlier. However, a theoretical analysis of such filters is lacking, as far as I know. <p> CHAPTER 5. ARTIFICIAL-VISCOSITY FILTER 192 5.5 The origin of high-frequency oscillations The origin of the slow-growing high-frequency numerical oscillations in simulations of compressible flow is not well understood. It is possible that the triggering of the oscillations is both numerical and physical. Peyret&Taylor <ref> [38, p.323] </ref> report that high-frequency oscillations appear both in explicit and implicit methods for transonic and supersonic compressible flow, which hints that there may be a physical cause that triggers the oscillations. It has been conjectured (Fletcher [18, p.438] and elsewhere) that physical turbulence may be triggering the numerical oscillations.

Chapter 4 The lattice Boltzmann method The lattice Boltzmann (LB) method is a numerical scheme for simulating viscous compressible flow in the subsonic regime (Koelman [29], Qian <ref> [41] </ref>, Chen [10]). In this chapter, the LB method is analyzed, and two major results are presented: the development of a new technique for accurate boundary and initial conditions for the LB method, and the demonstration that the LB method is second-order accurate in space and in time. <p> It is denoted "d2q7" following the naming convention of Qian <ref> [41] </ref>.

An issue with the above approach is the end-correction of an open-end pipe (Rayleigh <ref> [42, p.287] </ref>, Olson [36, p.84]). In the physical world, the point where the pressure equals the ambient pressure is not exactly the end of the pipe, but varies depending on the diameter of the pipe and possibly on other factors as well.

Physically, this means (Tritton <ref> [54] </ref> p.84 and p.114) that if the vorticity is initially zero, it will always remain zero. Of course, the viscosity can not be neglected in boundary layers where the velocity gradient is large. <p> The above discussion on potential flow, vortex theory, and boundary layers is not critical for the computer simulations, but it is useful background material.

In the case of subsonic flow, the term is often omitted because the gradient of the divergence of velocity is very small compared to the other terms of the momentum Navier Stokes equations (see below). <p> Of course, the problem of relating 2D to 3D results involves more than matching the units. For example, there are many 3D effects that remain un-modeled in 2D, such as 3D-expansion of waves versus a 2D-expansion, and also vortex stretching in 3D space (Tritton <ref> [54, p.114] </ref>) to mention a few (see also section 1.4 and chapter 7). For completeness, a few definitions of dimensionless numbers are summarized here. <p> Another important dimensionless number is the Reynolds number which measures the size of fluid inertia relative to the size of viscous effects (Tritton <ref> [54, p.97] </ref>). It is given by the ratio, Re = - where U and l are characteristic velocity and length scales of the flow. The choice of characteristic scales is somewhat arbitrary, and it depends on the geometry of the flow, and on which features we choose to focus on. <p> This coupling amplifies the resonant frequencies of the wire, and sometimes it even leads to disaster when there is not sufficient damping of the solid-object vibrations. The collapse of the Tacoma bridge and the collapse of industrial chimneys (Tritton <ref> [54, p.444] </ref>) are famous examples. * Reed musical instruments such as the clarinet and the harmonica also exploit the vibrations of solid obstacles.

Another observation is that the frequencies generated by the recorder are related by ratios of integers such as 1 : 3 : 5 : 7 : 9 which are characteristic of an open-closed pipe. <p> The potential model is also useful in situations which are too complex to analyze otherwise, and the potential model provides at least one estimate of the behavior of the flow.

The success of the potential model in these situations depends on CHAPTER 2. THE MOTION OF FLUIDS 74 having a good understanding of the flow in order to make the right assumptions and the right approximations. <p> Therefore, near the source the wave amplitude is large, and nonlinear effects can be very important, as in the case of the air jet in a flue pipe. Nonlinear effects are the basic mechanism for amplification of sound in flue pipes (Verge94 <ref> [56] </ref>, Hirschberg94 [26]).

CHAPTER 4. <p> The equilibrium population formulas F i fleq of the extended collision operator in clude terms which are based on the gradients of the fluid velocity, and are motivated by equation 2.5.1 of Wolfram <ref> [58] </ref>. <p> CHAPTER 4. THE LATTICE BOLTZMANN METHOD 179 used (dotted, dashed, solid lines). 4.7.2 Lattice gas methods This section discusses some background material regarding the relation between lattice Boltzmann and lattice gas methods. The lattice Boltzmann approach for simulating fluids is an outgrowth of the lattice gas approach <ref> [20, 15, 58, 23] </ref>. Both of these approaches have their origins in the kinetic theory of gases. The common idea behind them is that the advection and collision of particles can lead to the Navier-Stokes equations when the collision of particles conserves mass, momentum, and energy. <p> The common idea behind them is that the advection and collision of particles can lead to the Navier-Stokes equations when the collision of particles conserves mass, momentum, and energy. Furthermore, the particles must move along the edges of a numerical grid that is highly symmetric <ref> [20, 15, 58] </ref> and is called a lattice. For example, typical grids in two dimensions are the hexagonal and the orthogonal lattices. In three dimensions, a cubic lattice is commonly used.
