Reference-contexts: Several algebraic and topological methods which were introduced in proving lower bounds for deterministic algebraic decision trees (cf. [SY82], <ref> [B83] </ref>, [BLY92], [GKV95], [Y94]), with the exception of [BKL93], and [GK93], were not yielding lower bounds for the case of randomized decision trees. <p> In case we do not restrict the degree of the polynomials but charge for each arithmetic operation needed to compute them we talk about deterministic and randomized algebraic computation trees, CT s - 2 - and RCT s (for details see <ref> [B83] </ref>) with the similar notations for depth (or time). Note that neither the choice of the error probability from (0; 1 2 ), nor the particular choice of the complexity measure "maximum depth" are significant. <p> Then each LDT for L has depth (log (q)) [DL78], each d-DT for L has depth ( log (q) log (d) n) (can be deduced from <ref> [B83] </ref>, see also [SY82]), each CT for L has depth (log (q) n) [B83]. The last two results heavily depend on Milnor's bound on Betti numbers for real algebraic varieties, thus use deep results from algebraic topology. <p> Then each LDT for L has depth (log (q)) [DL78], each d-DT for L has depth ( log (q) log (d) n) (can be deduced from <ref> [B83] </ref>, see also [SY82]), each CT for L has depth (log (q) n) [B83]. The last two results heavily depend on Milnor's bound on Betti numbers for real algebraic varieties, thus use deep results from algebraic topology. In order to apply the component counting lower bound one has to count the number of connected components of interesting languages. <p> In [M84] it is shown that all these NP -complete problems have polynomial depth LDT s, for their n-dimensional restrictions. A further important example was the Element Distinctness Problem <ref> [B83] </ref>, with the connected components bound n!, and therefore a deterministic lower bound (n log n). As far as randomized DT s were concerned much less was known. In [M85a] it is shown that deterministic and randomized LDT s, d-DT s, and CT s, resp., are polynomially related. <p> certain path of T 0 (see the beginning of the proof of the lemma), we conclude that M 3 t m (nk)(1c) (td) c (nk) ; which proves Lemma 2: 2 8 Applications There is a number of applications of our method for concrete problems (see for examples, e. g., <ref> [B83] </ref> or [M85a]). We shall discuss the full list of concrete problems for which our method applies, and the corresponding randomized lower bounds, in the final version of this paper.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Starting with [MT82], [S83], [M85a] and [M85b] there has been a continued effort in the last decade to understand an intrinsic power of randomization in algebraic decision trees (see also <ref> [BKL93] </ref>, [GK93], [GK94] for some more recent results). Several algebraic and topological methods which were introduced in proving lower bounds for deterministic algebraic decision trees (cf.

[SY82], [B83], [BLY92], [GKV95], [Y94]), with the exception of [BKL93], and [GK93], were not yielding lower bounds for the case of randomized decision trees. <p> A randomized lower bound is shown in [M85b] that extends the lower bounds for e. g. the problems mentioned above to randomized LDT s. (A gap in that proof for the generic case was closed in [GK94].) In <ref> [BKL93] </ref> it is shown that there are benefits if the randomization is used in CT s: Consider the language f (x; y) 2 IR 2n : y is permutation of xg IR 2n . <p> Thus its deterministic complexity is (n log n) on the above deterministic models. On the other hand, as noted in <ref> [BKL93] </ref>, RCT s need time O (n) only. - 3 - 4 New Results. Consider S = S m T m i , where the H i 's are hyperplanes, and the H + i 's are halfspaces. S is often called a linear arrangement, S + is a polyhedron. <p> We note also an interesting application of our method towards the set f (x; y) 2 IR 2n : y is a permutation of xg IR 2n with the deterministic complexity (n log n), and with RCT s complexity O (n) <ref> [BKL93] </ref>. <p> Two important questions remain open: * Does our lower bound for RDT s hold also for sets of other structure, e. g. finite languages? Using the method of Example 2 in <ref> [BKL93] </ref> on polynomial zero-tests we can construct a finite set of n! points (permutations) in IR n , for which an RDT with degree n (cf. also the restriction on M in Theorem 2) needs a constant time.

Reference-contexts: The most important results in connection to this research are the variants of the component counting lower bound for deterministic computations: Let L IR n have q connected components.

As shown in <ref> [DL78] </ref> for k = 1 and in [M85b] for arbitrary k, IR n L n;k has (k + 1) (n 2 ) many connected components, yielding lower bounds (n 2 log (k + 1)) in the above models.
