Title: ON THE APPROXIMATION ORDER OF PRINCIPAL SHIFT-INVARIANT SUBSPACES OF L p (R d  
Author: Michael J. Johnson 
Date: January 11, 1996  
Abstract: For 1 p 1, sufficient conditions on the generators f h g h&gt;0 are given which ensure that the h-dilates of the shift-invariant space generated by h provide L p - approximation of order k &gt; 0. Examples where h is an exponential box spline or certain dilates of the Gaussian e jj 2 are considered; it is shown that our sufficient condition then provides an optimal lower bound on their approximation order.

In the following lemma, a description is given for a multi-level approximation scheme employing the dilated shifts of a function . <p> If is an integer and R d is open, then W 2 () is simply the Sobolev space defined in x1. It is fairly easy to see by the Plancherel Theorem (cf. <ref> [32; th.7.9] </ref>) that W 2 (R d ) = W 2 and that their norms are equivalent.

Finally, de Boor and Jia [7], using "local" rather than "con trolled" approximation, extended the L 2 result of [34] to L p for all 1 p 1. Later, interest in removing the compact support assumption on the generator developed and was investigated by Jackson [16], Buhmann [10], Light and Cheney [25], Jia and Lei [18], and Halton and Light [15]. The following was proved in [18]. Theorem 1.4. <p> Here the "control" is a combination of that used in <ref> [34] </ref> and the "localness" used in [7]. Note that the compact support assumption of [34], [11], and [7] has been replaced by the decay assumption (i) which, incidentally, becomes stronger as the approximation order k increases. <p> Here the "control" is a combination of that used in <ref> [34] </ref> and the "localness" used in [7]. Note that the compact support assumption of [34], [11], and [7] has been replaced by the decay assumption (i) which, incidentally, becomes stronger as the approximation order k increases. All of the above mentioned papers employ a technique known as Quasi-interpolation/Polynomial Reproduction for their error analysis.
