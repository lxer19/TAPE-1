Reference-contexts: Consequently, what you think might be obvious often is not to someone else. Consider something simple like a name, is it as obvious as you think? The following example illustrates what I mean (this brilliant example comes from a software engineering book by Edward Yourdon <ref> [Yourdon-89] </ref>). Data Dictionary 55 Example 5.1 Let's assume that a Martian has just landed in your backyard to ask you a few simple questions about the meaning of a person's name.
