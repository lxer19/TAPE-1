Title: The Virtual Cinematographer: A Paradigm for Automatic Real-Time Camera Control and Directing Category: Research  
Abstract: This paper presents a paradigm for automatically generating, in real-time, complete camera specifications for capturing events in virtual 3D environments. We demonstrate a fully implemented system called the Virtual Cinematographer as it is applied in a virtual "party" setting. The Virtual Cinematographer is implemented as a hierarchical finite state machine. Cinematographic expertise in the form of film idioms is encoded through a set of small finite state machines organized as a directed graph through call/return conventions and exception handling mechanisms. Each idiom is responsible for capturing a particular type of scene, such as three virtual actors conversing, or one actor moving across the environment. The idiom selects shot types and the timing of transitions between shots to best communicate events as they unfold. A set of camera modules shared by the idioms are responsible for the low level geometric placement of specific cameras for each shot type. The camera modules are also responsible for making subtle changes in the virtual actors' positions to best frame each shot. We discuss some basic heuristics of filmmaking and show how these ideas are encoded in the Virtual Cinematographer. Results are shown in the accompanying video.

Reference-contexts: Automating cinematography faces two difficulties not found in real-world filmmaking. First, while informal descriptions of the rules of cinematography are mentioned in a variety of texts <ref> [1, 11, 13] </ref>, they have never been stated explicitly enough to be expressed in a formal language. Second, performing automatic camera control in real-time imposes a constraint that is more difficult than that faced by most human directors. <p> There are approximately five useful camera distances <ref> [1, p. 18] </ref>. An extreme closeup cuts at the neck; a closeup cuts under the chest or at the waist; a medium view cuts at the crotch or under the knees; a full view shows the entire person; and a long view provides a distant perspective. <p> For example, in a dialogue among three actors, a filmmaker might begin with an establishing shot of all three people, before moving to an external reverse shots of two of the actors as they converse, interspersing occasional reaction shots of the third actor. Film books (Arijon <ref> [1] </ref>) provide an informal compilation of formulas, along with a discussion of the situations when a filmmaker might prefer one formula over another. this paper. The formula, adapted from Figure 6.29 of Arijon's text [1], provides a method for depicting conversations among three actors. <p> Film books (Arijon <ref> [1] </ref>) provide an informal compilation of formulas, along with a discussion of the situations when a filmmaker might prefer one formula over another. this paper. The formula, adapted from Figure 6.29 of Arijon's text [1], provides a method for depicting conversations among three actors. The first shot is an external reverse shot over the shoulder of actor A toward actors B and C. The second and third shots are external reverse shots of actors B and C alone.

Reference-contexts: The idiom also encodes when the situation has changed enough to have moved outside the idiom's domain of expertise, for example, when a third person enters a two-person conversation. In the VC, an idiom is implemented as a hierarchical finite state machine (FSM) <ref> [7] </ref>. Each state invokes a particular camera module. Thus, each state corresponds to a separate shot in the animation being generated. Each state also includes a list of conditions, which, when satisfied, cause it to exit along a particular arc to another state.
