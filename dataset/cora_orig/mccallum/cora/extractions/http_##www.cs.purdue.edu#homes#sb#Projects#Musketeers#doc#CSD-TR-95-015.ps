Abstract: In this work, a two prong dynamic paging activity data analysis is considered. The "skyline analysis" studies how similar/dissimilar is the paging activity of different node programs in SPMD execution mode. This analysis is done by determining the rate at which different events occur, by isolating the peaks of activity from the background, and by correlating the time of occurrence and the amplitude of these peaks. The second type of analysis is the "cumulative profile," used to determine the total load due to paging activity on the communication and the I/O sub-system. Finally, we report the result of analysis of the paging activities of a representative class of applications, the NAS parallel benchmark programs.

Reference-contexts: Figure 3 illustrates the cumulative profile of eight individual skylines using two processors. 5 The NAS Parallel Benchmarks The Numerical Aerodynamic Simulation (NAS) Parallel Benchmarks <ref> [1] </ref> have been developed at NASA Ames Research Center for the performance evaluation of highly parallel supercomputers. These benchmarks consist of five parallel kernel benchmarks and three simulated application benchmarks. The NAS application benchmarks mimic the computation and data movement characteristics of large scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications. <p> EP Embarrassingly Parallel Benchmark This benchmark provides an estimate of upper achievable limits for floating point performance on a particular system. Two dimensional statistics are accumulated from a large number of Gaussian pseudorandom numbers, generated according to a particular scheme described in <ref> [1] </ref>, and the number of pairs are tabulated in successive square annuli.

Reference-contexts: We also observed that, because of the poor performance of current virtual memory systems in massively parallel systems, the parallel program designers exchange the convenience of virtual memory for better performance by implementing their own data management, as described in <ref> [3] </ref>. To understand demand paging in MPPs better, we still need further evaluation of the same parallel systems running applications with real use of virtual memory system.

Reference-contexts: The level of intrusion of this monitoring system depends on the overhead of gathering the data associated with each event and the amount of data collected. An intrusive system <ref> [4] </ref> will increase drastically the execution time of the parallel program and will alter the behavior of the parallel programs we want to observe. 12 In our system, as in many other cases, a significant level of intrusion is caused by the act of storing the trace buffers on some external

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, previous measurements reported in <ref> [5] </ref> suggest that neither condition is satisfied. Another important issue is how to configure a parallel system to provide efficient virtual memory support, such as the number of I/O nodes needed and their optimal placement. <p> The data reduction is composed of the following three elements: peak selection, background filtering, and skyline representation for each individual trace data. The methodology for the reduction of trace data is described in <ref> [5] </ref> and [6]. The N highest peaks of activities are isolated and selected, and the rest are averaged as background activities. The graphical representation of peaks and background regions is called a skyline, representing the overall 6 paging behavior of a node program. <p> The purpose is to see how similar or dissimilar the paging activities in different nodes are. This type of analysis is described in detail in <ref> [5] </ref> and [6]. 4.2 The Cumulative Profile Analysis The cumulative profile is performed for page-ins and page-outs indicators by merging and adding individual skylines into a single global load representation. The cumulative profile is a graphical representation of the overall activity of a parallel program. <p> This confirms the conclusions we presented previously in <ref> [5] </ref>. The correlation in time of different peaks of activity and the correlation of the amplitude show great discrepancies for all the activity indicators. <p> The NAS benchmark programs are unique because of their lack of I/O operations and the mainly in-core computation. Although the benchmarks differ from each other, the general conclusion from the 19 skyline analysis and the cumulative profile analysis confirms what we have observed in a previous work <ref> [5] </ref>, studying another class of applications, the structural biology applications. We noted in both works, that there is a substantial dissimilarity of paging activity among the node program even for SPMD programs.
