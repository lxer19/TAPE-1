Reference-contexts: However, the effect of electrical noise sources can not be eliminated, since it is generated within the electronic devices that make up the system. Thus, electrical noise represents a fundamental limit on the performance of electronic circuits <ref> [1] </ref>. Even though the noise analysis and simulation methodology we will be presenting was developed to analyze the effects of electrical noise, it can also be quite useful in analyzing the effects of other types of noise on electronic circuits. <p> A c denotes the complement of a subset A of . A subset A of is called an event if it belongs to the -field F . A probability measure P on (; F ) is a function P : F ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> satisfying 1. <p> Such an X is called to be F measurable. The distribution function of a random variable X is the function F : IR ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> given by F (x) = P (X x) (2.4) where the abbreviation fX xg denotes the event f! 2 : X (!) xg 2 F . <p> The joint distribution function of a random vector X = [X 1 ; X 2 ; : : : ; X n ] on the probability space (; F ; P) is the function F : IR n ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> given by F (x) = P (X x) for x = [x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x n ] 2 IR n . <p> The (probability) mass function of a discrete random variable X is the function f : IR ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> given by f (x) = P (X = x). CHAPTER 2. <p> 1 ; t 2 ; : : : ; t n ] is a vector of members of T , then the vector [X (t 1 ); X (t 2 ); : : :; X (t n )] has the joint distribution function F (x; t) : IR n ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> given by F (x; t) = P (X (t 1 ) x 1 ; : : : ; X (t n ) x n ): The collection fF (x; t)g, as t ranges over all vectors of members of T of any finite length, is called the collection of <p> For fx i g n i=1 linearly independent, define X (t; t 0 ) = [(t; t 0 ; x 1 )j : : :j (t; t 0 ; x n )] (2.162) which is called a fundamental matrix for (2.161). If x i = <ref> [0; : : :; 0; 1; 0; : : :; 0] </ref>, with 1 at the i-th position, then the corresponding fundamental matrix is called the state-transition matrix for the differential equation (2.161), denoted as (t; t 0 ). <p> These traps capture and release carriers in a random fashion and the time constants associated with the process give rise to a noise signal with energy concentrated at low frequencies <ref> [1] </ref>. For MOS field-effect transistors, according to some studies, the carrier density fluctuations CHAPTER 3. NOISE MODELS 75 caused by the exchange of charge carriers between the channel and the interface traps are the cause [20]. Many theories have been proposed for flicker noise in various electronic components. <p> Note that the nonlinear relationship has to describe a dissipative device. For instance, the small-signal input resistance r of a bipolar transistor does not correspond to a physical resistor, hence does not generate thermal noise <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> This was relatively straightforward for thermal and shot noise, since they are modeled as "delta-correlated" noise processes having independent values at every time point, and they were modeled as modulated WSS white Gaussian noise processes. In <ref> [1] </ref>, it is pointed out that no 1=f noise is present in carbon resistors until a direct current (DC) is passed through the resistor 2 . <p> The noise voltage at the IF output of this circuit is nonstationary, because the signals applied to the circuit are large enough to change the operating point. The noise performance of a mixer circuit is usually characterized by its noise figure CHAPTER 5. TIME-DOMAIN NON-MONTE CARLO NOISE SIMULATION 155 <ref> [1] </ref>, which can be defined by N F = total IF output noise power that part of output noise power due to source resistance at RF port : (5.147) This definition is intended for circuits in small-signal operation. For such circuits, noise power is a constant function of time. <p> Note that larger values of fi 2 ff means worse phase noise performance. CHAPTER 6. NOISE IN FREE RUNNING OSCILLATORS 181 6.2.3.2 Relaxation oscillator The relaxation oscillator is a VCO that is based on the emitter-coupled multivibra-tor circuit <ref> [1] </ref>. [54] analyzes the "process of jitter production" for this circuit by describing the circuit behavior with a single first-order stochastic differential equation based on a simplified model for the circuit, and lumping all of the noise sources into a single stationary current noise source. [54] arrives at intuitive qualitative results <p> For the closed-loop case, the circuit may not have, and most often will not, have a periodic large signal steady-state solution. However at steady-state, i.e. when the loop is in lock, the VCO will be in "quasi" periodic steady-state. We now consider a simple phase-locked loop <ref> [1] </ref>, which uses the relaxation oscillator of Section 6.2.3.2 as the VCO, a Gilbert multiplier type phase detector and a single pole low pass filter as the loop filter. The reference is a noiseless periodic signal onto which the VCO is supposed to lock on. <p> To illustrate this procedure for the analysis of the acquisition characteristics, component behavioral models for a bipolar PLL <ref> [1] </ref> were set up, and behavioral simulation was used to analyze its acquisition characteristics. The VCO of the PLL circuit is the relaxation oscillator we analyzed in Chapter 6. The phase detector is a Gilbert multiplier, and the loop filter is a one pole, passive low pass filter.

Reference-contexts: We describe numerical algorithms for the characterization of phase noise in oscillators, and develop models based on its characterization. Top-down hierarchical design methodologies for analog and mixed-signal systems <ref> [4] </ref> have been proven to be quite effective in dealing with complexity, and in making the design systematic and modular. We believe that a hierarchical approach will be quite effective in dealing with the complexity of the nonlinear noise analysis problem for large and complicated systems. <p> This simulation can help in selecting the correct architecture to implement the analog function with constraints on the amount of non-idealities that is allowable given a set of specifications at the system level. The reader is referred to <ref> [59, 4] </ref> for a detailed treatment of behavioral modeling and simulation for analog and mixed-signal circuits, and its use within the framework of a top-down constraint-driven design methodology for analog and mixed-signal systems. <p> The PLL behavioral modeling and simulation techniques presented in this chapter were used in the top-down constraint-driven design of an on-chip clock generator for a video driver system (which was fabricated) <ref> [63, 4] </ref>. The architecture of this clock generator PLL circuit is the one shown in Figure 7.1, and the the loop filter is as the one shown in Figure 7.4. Some behavioral simulation results will be presented for this PLL, but the reader is referred to [63, 4] for a detailed <p> system (which was fabricated) <ref> [63, 4] </ref>. The architecture of this clock generator PLL circuit is the one shown in Figure 7.1, and the the loop filter is as the one shown in Figure 7.4. Some behavioral simulation results will be presented for this PLL, but the reader is referred to [63, 4] for a detailed description of how the behavioral modeling and simulation techniques of this chapter were used in its top-down design. <p> Figure 7.8 shows the response of the modeled PLL to a frequency step at the reference oscillator signal, both SPICE and behavioral simulation. Behavioral simulation is two orders of magnitude faster than SPICE. The acquisition characteristics of the clock generator PLL of <ref> [63, 4] </ref> was analyzed using behavioral simulation. The waveform shown in Figure 7.9 is the control voltage of the VCO when the PLL is acquiring the reference signal. This simulation was performed to analyze the stability of the feedback loop for the worst case frequency divider ratio. Figure CHAPTER 7. <p> In this way, the clock jitter constraint is mapped onto the delay cell jitter constraint. We will now present the behavioral simulation results obtained for the timing jitter characterization for the PLL of <ref> [63, 4] </ref>. The left plot in Figure 7.12 shows the square root of the variance for the self-referenced timing jitter process for the PLL output. (Please see the discussion in Section 7.4.2.1). <p> Reflections and coupling from the test board could have also affected the measurements. Considering these factors, the agreement between the measured result and the one predicted by behavioral simulation is quite satisfactory <ref> [63, 4] </ref>. 7.5.3 Phase noise spectrum Now, we illustrate the phase noise spectrum characterization of PLLs with behavioral simulations of a simple PLL circuit shown in Figure 7.13. <p> Figure 7.18 shows the phase noise spectrum of the closed-loop VCO for both cases. The phase noise spectrum obtained with behavioral simulation for the PLL of <ref> [63, 4] </ref> is shown in Figure 7.19 along with the phase noise spectrum of the open-loop VCO. 7.6 Summary In this chapter, we presented a hierarchical behavioral modeling and simulation methodology for the design of phase-locked loops used in clock generation and frequency synthesis applications. CHAPTER 7. <p> This probably results in a design with components that are over-specified to compensate for the simplistic analysis that establishes the connection between the overall system specifications and the specifications for the components that make up the system. We believe that a top-down hierarchical design methodology <ref> [4] </ref> is the most effective framework to establish the rigorous connection between the overall noise performance specifications, e.g. BER, and the noise performance characterizations of the components, e.g. the phase noise of the LO.

We will concentrate on linear transformations, because most of the practical systems we will be dealing with can be approximately modeled as linear systems for noise signals. <p> If (t) is large compared with the inverse of the width of the pulse h (t), it means that many pulses overlap at each instant in time, and hence the central limit theorem can be used to conclude that the shot noise process is approximately Gaussian <ref> [5] </ref>. For instance, if the mean current I is 1 mA, and if the charge carriers are electrons with charge q = 1:6 fi 10 19 C, CHAPTER 3. <p> To simulate "white" noise sources accurately, one must either include very high frequency components in the sum of sinusoids representation, or set the pulse width to a very small value (to the correlation width of the noise sources, which is approximately 0:17 picoseconds for thermal noise at room temperature <ref> [5] </ref>) in the random amplitude pulse waveform representation. This limits the maximum time-step in numerical integration of (4.20) to a very small value making the simulation highly inefficient, which has to be repeated "many" times in a Monte Carlo fashion. <p> To calculate the fourth-order moments for J, we assume that it is a Gaussian process. Then, the fourth-order moments can be expressed in terms of the second-order moments using Isserlis's formula <ref> [5] </ref>.

CHAPTER 2. MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND 14 The "complete" collection of the sample paths of a stochastic process is called the ensemble. The X (t) (for different values of t) are not independent in general. <p> T i are called a set of Poisson time points, and I (t) in (3.9) is called a Poisson pulse train <ref> [7] </ref>. In (3.9), we let 1 &lt; t &lt; 1 and let the starting time for the Poisson counting process N (t) go to 1 so that the current process I (t) is in "steady-state". In reality, the charge carrier crossings can not be instantaneous. <p> This is equivalent to passing the Poisson pulse train in (3.9) through an LTI system with CHAPTER 3. NOISE MODELS 77 impulse response h (t) <ref> [7] </ref>. We get I (t) = i The shape of the pulse h (t) is determined by the specific characteristics of the device. <p> As far as we are concerned, it is a pulse with area equal to 1 and the pulse width is equal to the transit time of the carrier through the depletion layer. One can calculate the mean of the current I (t) <ref> [7] </ref>, using the properties of the Poisson counting process, to be I (t) = E [I (t)] = q 1 Now, we define the noise current ~ I (t) to be the difference between the total current I (t) and its mean I (t) ~ I (t) = I (t) E <p> current I (t) and its mean I (t) ~ I (t) = I (t) E [I (t)]: (3.12) Obviously, the mean of the noise current ~ I (t) is zero, and its autocorrelation (which is equal to the autocovariance of the total current I (t)) can be calculated to be <ref> [7] </ref> R ~ I (t; t ) = E ~ I (t + t =2) ~ I (t t =2) (3.13) Z 1 (u)h (t + t =2 u)h (t t =2 u)du: (3.14) If the rate (t) = is a constant, then (3.11) and (3.14) reduce to I (t) = <p> The spectral density of ~ I (t) with a constant rate can be calculated to be <ref> [7] </ref> where H (f ) = F fh (t)g. Note that H (0) = 1, since the area under h (t) is equal to 1. From (3.15), we have = q I (t) = q CHAPTER 3. <p> Now, we discuss the fdds for the shot noise process. It can be shown that if the rate (t) is large compared with the inverse of the width of the pulse h (t), then the shot noise process ~ I (t) is approximately Gaussian <ref> [7] </ref>. If (t) is large compared with the inverse of the width of the pulse h (t), it means that many pulses overlap at each instant in time, and hence the central limit theorem can be used to conclude that the shot noise process is approximately Gaussian [5].

We will concentrate on linear transformations, because most of the practical systems we will be dealing with can be approximately modeled as linear systems for noise signals. <p> Motivated by the usefulness of the Laplace/Fourier transform theory for LTI systems, an effort was made in the literature to develop a complete operational calculus for linear time-varying (LTV) systems by "extending" the Laplace/Fourier transform theory. Such a transform was proposed by L-otfi Zadeh in 1950 <ref> [8] </ref>. There was a controversy in the literature on the usefulness of this transform. Nevertheless, for our purposes, this transform forms a rigorous basis for analyzing the effect of noise on LTV systems.

If we take the expectation of both sides of (2.231) we get 2 dt h i h 2 ; (2.232) where we have used E [I (t)d-(t)] = 0. <p> through the use of first-order Taylor's expansion of nonlinearities in (5.5) [3], but some of the steps in this derivation are not mathematically sound (which has to do with considering the "derivative" of a stochastic process using deterministic arguments). 5.3 Small Noise Expansion We will apply a stochastic perturbation scheme <ref> [10] </ref> to the NLSDE formulation given in (5.5) for a nonlinear circuit with noise sources. We introduce a parameter * to (5.5) as a multiplying factor in the last term that describes the noise sources. <p> Now, not to complicate the notation, we assume that both x and I are scalars to demonstrate how one can obtain the expansion in (5.12).

Note that I 1 = 0. The validity of the above expression can be easily seen by examining (5.14).

In order to obtain a closed form of moment equations, some closure approximations have to be introduced to truncate the infinite hierarchy. In a practical problem, one is usually interested only in some lower order moments. <p> In a practical problem, one is usually interested only in some lower order moments. Closure approximations have been proposed in the literature in solving stochastic problems in several disciplines such as turbulence theory, control and vibratory systems <ref> [13] </ref>. One of the simplest closure approximations that first comes to mind is the Gaussian closure scheme, according to which, higher order moments are expressed in terms of the first and second order moments as if the components of X are Gaussian stochastic processes. <p> Closure schemes are designed using specific characteristics of the problem in hand. Not all the closure approximations proposed in the literature have sound mathematical basis, but they can be justified using the physical properties of the specific problem they are being used for <ref> [13] </ref>. Using these closure schemes, one arrives at systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations for various moments. By solving these equations numerically, one can calculate the time evolution of the moments of the state X (t). We now point out some properties of the problem we are trying to solve. <p> Thus, the derivation of a small-signal analysis scheme for noise signals should be done using approximation techniques developed for stochastic processes and systems. An approximate technique developed in the analysis of engineering nonlinear dynamical systems subjected to random excitations is the perturbation method <ref> [13] </ref>. The idea behind this method comes from the classical theory of ordinary differential equations. In this method, a small parameter * t 1 is usually introduced to the system, and the solution is expressed in the form of an expansion with respect to the powers of *.

Reference-contexts: CHAPTER 2. MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND 50 Given all the above, one can easily verify that the state transition matrix for (2.180) can be expressed as <ref> [16] </ref> (t; t ) = i=1 i (t ): (2.202) The state transition matrix of (2.192), (t; t ) is then given by (t; t ) = (t; t) T (2.203) in terms of the state transition matrix of (2.180). <p> We will prove a key property of our definition of phase noise and the characterization algorithm: Phase noise is same at all nodes in the oscillator circuit. We will then discuss the work of Franz Kaertner <ref> [16] </ref> on phase noise (a rigorous approach to noise analysis of oscillators), and review his phase noise definition and characterization algorithm 1 The February 1966 issue of the Proceedings of the IEEE contains a number of papers on the analysis of noise in oscillators. <p> A second eigenvalue that has a magnitude close to 1 suggests that the oscillator circuit is close to being unstable, which is usually the case for high-Q oscillators <ref> [16] </ref>. We will calculate the eigenvalues of (T; 0) for several oscillators later. <p> The periodic vector v 1 (t) can be computed as a periodic steady-state solution of (6.63). It turns out that the phase noise characterization methodology proposed by Franz Kaertner <ref> [16] </ref> arrives at exactly the same phase noise characterization represented by (6.85) we obtained, even though his definition of phase noise, and his derivation of the phase noise characterization is completely different than ours. <p> The numerical method he proposes for phase noise characterization is based on calculating v 1 (t) and using (6.85). We will discuss Kaertner's work in more detail in the next section. 6.4 Kaertner's Work on Phase Noise Kaertner <ref> [16] </ref> 5 defines timing jitter/phase noise for a free running autonomous oscillator as a continuous-time stochastic process: X (t) = x s (t + -(t)) + 4X (t + -(t)) (6.86) where x s (t) represents the periodic steady state solution of the oscillator circuit without the noise sources (which is <p> Kaertner <ref> [16] </ref> describes a numerical method for the computation of v 1 (t). Without providing 6 In a former paper [55], Kaertner uses a different restriction to fully specify the decomposition in (6.86). He reexamines this restriction in [16], and modifies it as described above. <p> Kaertner <ref> [16] </ref> describes a numerical method for the computation of v 1 (t). Without providing 6 In a former paper [55], Kaertner uses a different restriction to fully specify the decomposition in (6.86). He reexamines this restriction in [16], and modifies it as described above. His motivation for the new definition is that, with the new definition, the decomposition into amplitude and phase noise is independent of the coordinate system used. <p> Thus, if we scale -(t) with 2f c we obtain the phase noise process. 8 The reader is referred to <ref> [16] </ref> for the details of his work, although it might require some "digging" into his notation to clearly see what is going on. CHAPTER 6. <p> This specific phase noise characterization algorithm turns out to be exactly equivalent to the one proposed by Kaertner <ref> [16] </ref> with a different definition for phase noise, and a different derivation. We implemented the above algorithm in SPICE. We will not present a detailed description of this implementation here, but we will mention a few important points. <p> As seen in Table 6.4, the eigenvalues with magnitudes close to 1 are very "close" to each other, so it is not feasible to identify the correct eigenvalue by calculating (T; 0) more accurately 12 The issue of identifying the correct eigenvalue was not addressed by Kaertner in <ref> [16] </ref>. CHAPTER 6. <p> Thus, fl t 2f c will be satisfied for all of the significant low pass filtered white noise components in the model of a 1=f noise source. Then, (6.138) can be used for all of the components. Kaertner in <ref> [16] </ref> also proposes a phase noise characterization technique for 1=f noise sources. After some "digging" into his notation, it can be shown that his results are consistent with what we have concluded above. <p> CHAPTER 6. NOISE IN FREE RUNNING OSCILLATORS 213 circuits. Moreover, the analysis in Section 6.3 resulted in a more specific and efficient algorithm, i.e. Algorithm II, to characterize the random walk process that models phase noise. We then reviewed Franz Kaertner's work on phase noise <ref> [16] </ref>, which we believe is one of the few that treats the problem rigorously.

This is not possible, considering the large number of particles we are talking about. A complete specification on a particle by particle basis does not make sense in quantum mechanics, but the specification of an exact quantum state for the system as a whole is equally impossible [18]. Hence, the state of a macroscopic system is coarsely specified in terms of a relatively small number of parameters. A branch of physics, statistical mechanics, allows us to make predictions about the behavior of the system. <p> Although one can not specify the exact configuration of the particles at any instant, these particles are subject to precise dynamical laws, and these laws govern the evolution of one microscopic configuration into another as time proceeds <ref> [18] </ref>. One of the most significant and simplest system constraints is thermodynamic equilibrium. The concept of thermodynamic equilibrium is fundamentally associated with time-invariance. A system in thermodynamic equilibrium will remain in that state forever unless acted on by an external force. <p> resistor (as a matter of fact, any two-terminal linear electrical circuit with a purely resistive impedance), having a resistance R, maintained in thermal equilibrium at a temperature T , are independent of such parameters 1 The discussion of shot and thermal noise and their distinction is summarized from [17] and <ref> [18] </ref>. CHAPTER 3. <p> Hence, bipolar transistors are typical shot noise limited devices. By contrast, in a field-effect transistor, the carrier fluctuations are established in the channel, and this is also where the carriers interact with the applied voltages. A field-effect transistor is, therefore, a thermal noise limited device <ref> [18] </ref>. For MOS field-effect transistors in weak-inversion (subthreshold operation), the generated noise can also be explained using shot noise arguments. In fact, at thermal equilibrium, both shot and thermal noise arguments produce identical results, consistent with the previous comment on shot and thermal noise not being mutually exclusive [20]. <p> The characteristics of flicker noise considerably change from device to device, even for two same type of devices on the same die. This suggests that flicker noise is often associated with the fine details of the device structure <ref> [18] </ref>. Flicker noise has been experimentally observed in a great variety of electronic components and devices, including carbon resistors, pn junction diodes, bipolar transistors, and field-effect transistors. <p> Thus, flicker or 1=f noise can only occur in non-equilibrium situations in devices subjected to applied bias voltages or bias voltages derived from a signal <ref> [18] </ref>. 1=f noise has been observed as fluctuations in the parameters of many systems apart from semiconductor devices. <p> CHAPTER 3. NOISE MODELS 76 3.2 Model for Shot Noise as a Stochastic Process For a pn junction diode, it can be shown that the current in the external leads is, approximately, a result of the charge carriers crossing the depletion layer <ref> [18] </ref>. For every charge carrier crossing the depletion layer, the current in the external leads consists of a short pulse, of total charge q of the charge carrier. Now, let us assume that the charge carriers are being emitted into the depletion layer from only one side of the junction. <p> The real situation is more complicated, of course. There are two types of charge carriers, electrons and holes, and they are emitted into the depletion layer from both sides of the junction. Now, we summarize Robinson's discussion from <ref> [18] </ref> for the different current components for a pn junction diode. To simplify the discussion, we assume that recombination between holes and electrons is negligible. <p> I (V ): (3.41) At zero bias, V = 0, (3.41) becomes S (t; f ) = 2kT G (0): (3.42) At zero bias, the diode is a system in thermodynamic equilibrium, so (3.42) can be interpreted as the spectral density of thermal noise associated with the conductance G (0) <ref> [18] </ref>. However, note that, the conductance G (0) does not correspond to a physical resistor. A similar observation for the noise of a MOSFET in weak inversion can be made [20]. <p> In [1], it is pointed out that no 1=f noise is present in carbon resistors until a direct current (DC) is passed through the resistor 2 . Robinson in <ref> [18] </ref> mentions that any electronic device or component subjected to either a DC bias, or a strong AC (alternating current) signal can generate 1=f noise.

Many theories have been proposed for flicker noise in various electronic components. Each theory is involved, and gives rise to a different spectral density expression for the stochastic process that models the noise current in the device. <p> The one important point on which all the theories, as well as experimental results, agree is that the spectral density for the stochastic process that models flicker noise is approximately inversely proportional to the frequency f for a WSS stochastic process model <ref> [20] </ref>.

It has been shown in [23] that N = 20 poles uniformly distributed over 14 decades are sufficient to generate 1=f noise over 10 decades with a maximum error less than 1%. <p> (which is modeled as a "constant modulated" version of the WSS Gaussian process as discussed before) of an LTI resistor R h connected in parallel to a capacitance C h = C, and their sum can be achieved by putting N of such R h C h groups in series <ref> [23] </ref>, as shown in Figure 3.1. This is a MISO, stable, LTI system with inputs as the WSS Gaussian processes modeling the thermal noise current sources of the resistors.

Reference-contexts: The noise analysis technique we described in this section is usually referred to as AC noise analysis, since it models a nonlinear circuit with an LTI network for noise analysis. It is available in almost every circuit simulator including SPICE <ref> [28] </ref>, and it is widely used by analog circuit designers. The major limitation of this technique lies in the assumption that the nonlinear circuit has only time-invariant deterministic excitations and a time-invariant steady-state solution. Of course, all practical electronic circuits are supposed to deal with time-varying excitations. <p> In Chapter 6, we will deeply investigate the meaning of these results for autonomous nonlinear circuits with a large-signal periodic steady-solution for (5.87). 5.10 Examples We implemented the numerical computation of the autocorrelation matrix, as described in Section 5.7, in the circuit simulator SPICE <ref> [28, 50] </ref>.

The large-signal analysis method that is used by [30] to calculate the periodic steady-state, and hence to construct the LPTV model for noise analysis, is the shooting method <ref> [29] </ref>. <p> One can usually identify these strong spectral components by just looking at the waveform of v c (t). By performing Fourier analysis (using an appropriate numerical technique such as FFT, almost periodic transform, etc. <ref> [29, 62] </ref>) on the steady-state waveform of v c (t) obtained from time domain noise simulation, one can identify and quantify these spectral components.

The phase noise spectrum obtained with behavioral simulation for the PLL of <ref> [63, 4] </ref> is shown in Figure 7.19 along with the phase noise spectrum of the open-loop VCO. 7.6 Summary In this chapter, we presented a hierarchical behavioral modeling and simulation methodology for the design of phase-locked loops used in clock generation and frequency synthesis applications.
