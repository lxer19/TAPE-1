Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we introduce some mortar finite element methods for solving two-dimensional elliptic problems discretized on overlapping non-matching grids. We prove optimal error bound and estimate the condition numbers of certain overlapping Schwarz preconditioned systems for the two-subdomain case. We show that the error bound is independent of the size of the overlap and the ratio of the mesh parameters. In the second part, we introduce three additive Schwarz preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithms based on the trivial and harmonic extensions. We provide estimates for the spectral bounds on the condition numbers of the preconditioned operators. We show that although the error bound is independent of the size of the overlap, the condition number does depend on it. Numerical examples are presented to support our theory.

The idea of using overlapping non-matching grids is not exactly new. <p> The curve fl i has two sides. We refer to one of them as the mortar side, and the other the non-mortar side. In 3 most mortar element methods, see e.g. <ref> [5] </ref>, the choice is rather arbitrary. In our case, we have only one choice. For fl 1 , we define the T h 2 side as the mortar side and the T h 1 side as the non-mortar side. <p> Applying the trace theorem for w, we deduce that fi fi fi fl 1 @n fi fi fi 2 ~ W h 1 (fl 1 ) &lt; fl fl fl @n fl fl fl 9 ; With the help of Lemma 3 (or Lemma 4.1 of Bernardi, Maday and Patera <ref> [5] </ref>), we obtain fi fi fi fl 1 @n fi fi fi t 1 fl fl fl @n fl fl H 1=2+t 1 (fl 1 ) t 1 fl 11 5. Technical lemmas. In this section, we discuss several technical estimates. <p> We formulate and prove some of the lemmas in a way that is more general than needed in this paper since we believe their applicabilities go beyond this paper. The proof of the following lemma can be found in Bernardi, Maday and Patera <ref> [5] </ref>, although their definition of the mortar mapping is slightly different from ours for Case L because of the two extra intervals [a i 0 ; a i m i ; a i m i +1 ].
