Abstract: Researchers have long argued that an attentional mechanism is required to perform many vision tasks. This paper introduces an attentional prototype for early visual processing. Our model is composed of a processing hierarchy and an attention beam that traverses the hierarchy, passing through the regions of greatest interest and inhibiting the regions that are not relevant. The type of input to the prototype is not limited to visual stimuli. Simulations using high-resolution digitized images were conducted, with image intensity and edge information as inputs to the model. The results confirm that this prototype is both robust and fast, and promises to be essential to any real-time vision system.

Reference-contexts: In our model, constant time is required irrespective of the locations of the sensory items. Anderson and van Essen have proposed the idea of "shifter networks" to explain attentional effects in vision <ref> [1] </ref>. There is some similarity between their model and the inhibitory beam idea presented here. The Anderson and van Essen proposal requires a two-phase process.

Reference-contexts: Califano, Kjeldsen and Bolle propose a multiresolution system in which the input is processed simultaneously at a coarse resolution throughout the image and at a finer resolution within a small "window" <ref> [2] </ref>. An attention control mechanism directs the high-resolution spot. In many respects, our scheme may be considered a more general expansion of the Califano model. Our model, however, allows for many resolutions whereas Califano's is restricted to two.

Reference-contexts: For example, Chapman <ref> [3] </ref> has recently implemented a system based on the idea of a pyramid model of attention introduced by Koch and Ullman [5]. Chapman's model places a log-depth tree above a saliency map. Similar to our model, at each level nodes receive activation from nodes below.

Reference-contexts: In short, attention simplifies computation and reduces the amount of processing. Computer vision models which incorporate parallel processing are prevalent in the literature. This strategy appears appropriate for the vast amounts of input data that must be processed at the low-level <ref> [4, 19] </ref>. However, complete parallelism is not possible because it requires too many processors and connections [11, 17]. Instead, a balance must be found between processor-intensive parallel techniques and time-intensive serial techniques.

Reference-contexts: The pass zone permeates the winners at each level and the inhibit zone encompasses those elements at each level that competed in the WTA process. This algorithm is similar to the basic idea proposed by Koch and Ullman <ref> [5] </ref>. One important difference is that our scheme does not rely on a saliency map. Another distinction is that we use a modified WTA update rule that allows for multiple winners and does not attenuate the winning inputs 2 . <p> For example, Chapman [3] has recently implemented a system based on the idea of a pyramid model of attention introduced by Koch and Ullman <ref> [5] </ref>. Chapman's model places a log-depth tree above a saliency map. Similar to our model, at each level nodes receive activation from nodes below. It differs, however, in that Chapman's model only passes the maximum of these values to the next level.

Reference-contexts: The focus of attention falls on the longest lines first (only a portion of the longest line is attended to first in this example because maxRF = 100). is dependent on its location, which is contrary to recent psychological evidence <ref> [6] </ref>. In our model, constant time is required irrespective of the locations of the sensory items. Anderson and van Essen have proposed the idea of "shifter networks" to explain attentional effects in vision [1]. There is some similarity between their model and the inhibitory beam idea presented here.

Reference-contexts: Marr suggests the following selection criterion for RF sizes: choose a given size if receptive fields of slightly smaller size give an appreciably smaller response and receptive fields that are larger do not give appreciably larger responses <ref> [7] </ref>. Marr notes, however, that more than one receptive field size may satisfy this requirement. For instance, consider a normalizing function that is linear. Also consider a 256 fi 256 image-sized RF whose weighted average is 128.

Reference-contexts: The size and shape of their coarse resolution representation are also fixed. These restrictions do not allow a "shrink wrapping" around an object, as it is attended to, from coarser to finer resolutions; nevertheless, our model performs this, as also observed in monkey visual cortex by Moran and Desimone <ref> [8] </ref>. Several attentional schemes have been proposed by the connectionist community. Mozer describes a model of attention based on iterative relaxation [9]. Attentional selection is performed by a network of simple computing units that constructs a variable-diameter "spotlight" on the retinotopic representation.

Reference-contexts: The time required may be quite long if there are similar regions of activity that are widely separated. For example, Mozer reports that his scheme took up to 100 iterations to settle on a 36 fi 6 image <ref> [10] </ref>. These schemes are clearly not suited to real-world high-resolution images. Summary We have argued that an attention mechanism is a necessary component of a computer vision system if it is to perform tasks in a complex, real world.

Reference-contexts: The attention shifts discussed throughout this paper have been covert forms of attention in which different regions of the visual input have been attended. It is experimentally well established that these covert attention shifts occur in the humans <ref> [12] </ref>. In a similar way, the human visual system has special fast mechanisms called saccades for moving the fovea to different spatial targets (overt attention). The first systematic study of saccadic eye movements in the context of behaviour was done by Yarbus [20].

Reference-contexts: This spotlight allows sensory information within it to be preferentially processed. Sandon describes a model which also uses an iterative rule but performs the computation at several spatial scales simultaneously <ref> [13] </ref>. There are several shortcomings of iterative models such as these. One problem is that the settling time is quite sensitive to the size and nature of the image. The time required may be quite long if there are similar regions of activity that are widely separated.

Reference-contexts: Spatial attentional influence is applied in a "spotlight" fashion at the top. The notion of a spotlight appears in many other models such as that of Treisman <ref> [15] </ref>. However, if the spotlight shines on a unit at the top of the hierarchy, there seems to be no mechanism for the rest of the selection to actually proceed through to the desired items.

Reference-contexts: Vision systems that have no task guidance, and must provide a description of everything in the scene at a high level of detail as opposed to searching and describing only a sub-image for a pre-specified item, have been shown to be computationally intractable <ref> [16] </ref>. Thus, task guidance, or attention, plays a critical role in a system that is hoped to function in real time. In short, attention simplifies computation and reduces the amount of processing. Computer vision models which incorporate parallel processing are prevalent in the literature. <p> Since R 2 is 100 times the size of R 1 and over 99% the intensity, it seems reasonable to favour R 2 over R 1 . Formally, this is exactly one of the constraints proposed in Tsotsos 1989 <ref> [16] </ref> for visual search: given more than one match with approximately the same error, choose the largest one.
