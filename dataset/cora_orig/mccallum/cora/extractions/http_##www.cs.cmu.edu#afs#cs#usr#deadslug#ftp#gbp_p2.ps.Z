Note: 305 GESTURE-BASED PROGRAMMING, PART 2:  
Abstract: In part one of this two-part series, we described our Gesture-Based Programming paradigm for programming by human demonstration. This paradigm depends on a pre-existing knowledge base of capabilities, collectively called encapsulated expertise, that comprise the real-time sensorimotor primitives from which the run-time executable is constructed as well as providing the basis for interpreting the teachers actions during programming. In this paper we present a technique based on principal components analysis, augmentable with model-based information, for learning and recognizing sen-sorimotor primitives. We describes simple applications of the technique to a mobile robot and a PUMA manipulator. The mobile robot learned to escape from jams while the manipulator learned guarded moves and accommodations that are composable to allow at plate mating operations. While these initial applications are simple, they demonstrate the ability to extract primitives from demonstration, recognize the learned primitives in subsequent demonstrations, and combine and transform primitives to create different capabilities.

Reference-contexts: The drive and steering motors have three-valued -- forward-off-reverse -- commands with no closed-loop controllers on velocity or position. For this initial experiment there are no redundant groups of very similar and correlated sense elements such as a visual retina <ref> (as in Hancock and Thorpe, 1995) </ref> or sonar ring. The shape from motion technique allows the robot to develop an internal representation of teleoperated interaction to produce meaningful externalized behavior.

Reference-contexts: The first is clairvoyance. The user (or automatic planner), acting as a god, hand codes a primitive that he/she knows is useful and composable. An example of this is a guarded move. The second mechanism is through assembly of lower-level primitives <ref> (i.e. Morrow and Khosla, 1995) </ref>. Using a calculus analogy, algebraic primitives may form the basis for calculus, but arithmetic primitives form the basis for algebra. Finally, there is learning.

Reference-contexts: The skills learned are manipulator positioning tasks without force or vision feedback. Pook and Ballard (1992) performed similar work. Along these lines of skill acquisition by supervised learning is ALVINN, an artificial neural network for vehicle steering <ref> (Pomerleau, 1992) </ref>. ALVINN has demonstrated robust mastery over a wide range of vehicles and road types by observing a human drive the vehicle on the target road type. For the purpose of comparison, Hancock and Thorpe (1995) developed ELVIS, a PCA-based vehicle steerer to operate on the same vehicles.

Reference-contexts: Finally, there is learning. In this paper, we present a learning approach for extracting sensorimotor primitives from teleoperated manipulations that is a natural extension of an autonomous sensor calibration technique called Shape from Motion <ref> (Voyles et al, 1995a) </ref>. Calibra In Intelligent Engineering Systems Through Artificial Neural Net works, Volume 6; Smart Engineering Systems: Neural Networks, Fuzzy Logic and Evolutionary Programming, ASME Press, 1996 306 tion is, afterall, a form of learning. <p> It became apparent that Shape from Motion could be applied to other types of learning problems, as well. Shape from Motion is based on the extraction of an eigenspace representation of the input/output mapping by SVD to derive principle components. In the case of force/ torque sensor calibration <ref> (described in Voyles et al, 1995a) </ref>, the principle components analysis (PCA) is constraint-directed, so model-based information can be incorporated into the learning process. Because the underlying representation (a set of eigenvec-tors) is linear, it is limited to learning linear, or at least piece-wise linear, interactions. <p> By incorporating model-based information, we have also applied it to nearly autonomous calibration of force/torque sensors with equal or greater accuracy than the traditional least-squares technique <ref> (data in Voyles et al, 1995a) </ref>. 310 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Mr. Voyles was supported in part by a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship.
