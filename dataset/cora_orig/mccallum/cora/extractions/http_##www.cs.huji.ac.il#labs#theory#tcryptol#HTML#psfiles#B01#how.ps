Title: How to use my 1989 Lecture Notes on Encryption, Signatures and Crypto-Protocols  
Author: Oded Goldreich

Abstract: This document is written to complement my 1989 lecture notes on Encryption, Signatures and Cryptographic Protocols. In it I sketch what I believe should be done when trying to use these notes as part of a course on Foundations of Cryptography. In addition, I also indicate what I believe should be done in order to augment the material so that it can fit into a comprehensive book on Foundations of Cryptography.

Reference-contexts: good ways of using them (and link these to the insights gained by the formal treat ment). 3 Digital Signatures * Discuss more relaxed notions of security: see [10] for a truly excellent discussion. * Present alternative constructions: Specifically, I'd consider presenting the construction of [11] (instead the one of <ref> [1] </ref> presented in the notes). For a book, consider [5, 6, 12]. * De-emphasis the Paradox: The rational for presenting it is merely to warn against vague intuitions in the context of Cryptography.

Unfortunately, I cannot refer the reader to any better treatment of the Insecure Channel Model than the one given in the notes.

Fragments of a Book on Foundations of Cryptography [8]. In my opinion, the fragments provide a good draft covering three major topics: One-Way Functions, Pseudorandom Generators and Zero-Knowledge Proofs. These topics are central to Cryptography as well as of interest from a Complexity Theoretic point of view.
