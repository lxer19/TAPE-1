Abstract: An algorithm for linear programming (LP) and convex quadratic programming (CQP) is proposed, based on an interior point iteration introduced more than ten years ago by J. Herskovits for the solution of nonlinear programming problems. Herskovits' iteration can be simplified significantly in the LP/CQP case, and quadratic convergence from any initial point can be achieved. Interestingly the linear system solved at each iteration is identical to that of the primal-dual affine scaling scheme recently considered by Monteiro et al. independently of Herskovits' work. The proposed algorithm, however, uses an iteratively selected step length, different for each component of the dual variable.

Reference-contexts: a fast rate of convergence, even for problems that can be solved in finitely many iterations (such as LP and CQP problems) has been stressed by several authors (e.g., [16,17] and references therein) and recently a primal-dual logarithmic barrier method has been shown to be both polynomial-time and Q-quadratically convergent <ref> [18] </ref>. The algorithm proposed here however has the advantage of greater simplicity (no centering step, i.e., no barrier parameter to be iteratively adjusted). 5 Appendix: Proof of Some Results Proof of Lemma 2.1. Let (d; ) be such that M (x; ) = 0.
