Abstract: There are two conflicting requirements imposed on modern database systems: high expressive power (leading to high complexity) and fast response time. We feel that this conflict can be resolved through an appropriate notion of approximate query evaluation. We formulate here foundations of a theory of approximate query answering by providing the notion of justified partial answers. We also introduce cautious query evaluation procedures which always converge to justified partial answers.

Reference-contexts: Further in the paper we will deal only with finite subsets of DB' serving as approximations of the original database DB. In the paper we will concentrate on the Top-Down query evaluation style (we intend to extend our techniques to Bottom-Up techniques in the future). The Top-Down techniques <ref> [1] </ref> are based on SLD-resolution (also globally may differ significantly). We define SLD-derivation below.

Reference-contexts: A partial answer then seems to be one of only the few options left. For others see <ref> [4] </ref> Example 1 (Numerical Computation) Suppose we want to estimate the value of x 2 + 1 whose actual value is, say, 1.12. The approximation 1.25 could be a reasonable one.

Reference-contexts: To our knowledge this is the first such approach in the context of logical databases, although [6] investigates similar ideas in the context of relational databases. Some initial ideas leading to this theory were presented in <ref> [5] </ref>. 4 Unfortunately there is no direct way to translate this into rounding up of the result as in numerical analysis 5 We will be quite specific about the class of acceptable justifications The main contributions of this paper are: providing a framework for approximate query answering and developing, within this

Reference-contexts: Given a top-down query evaluation procedure, we show how to make it cautious. 1.3 Summary This paper intends to be the first step in providing a theory of approximate query answering.
