Title: Part 2: Initial Value Problems  
Abstract-found: 0
Intro-found: 1

Reference-contexts: The assumption that y 00 (t) exists is not necessary. A proof without this assumption appears in Hairer et al. [2], Section 1.7. They also show that the Lipschitz condition on f (t; y) need only be satisfied on a compact domain rather than an infinite strip. Gear <ref> [1] </ref>, Section 1.3, presents a proof with the additional assumption that f (t; y) satisfy a Lipschitz condition on t instead of requiring y 00 (t) to be bounded. Example 2.1.3.
