Reference-contexts: Madsen [56], in studying the effect of viewpoint variation on pose estimation, considers the empirical and predictive variances of the pose parameters, but again fails to address their effects on point estimation. Arbel and Ferrie <ref> [1] </ref> use statistical estimation model densities for volumetric models, in a recognition by part approach. Also authors from the "neural network" community have been active in this field. <p> This term measures how well an architecture and a certain parameter vector "explain" the available data. In our case the classification task is "one out of q" and we want the model output be continuous and approximating a probability measure over <ref> [0; 1] </ref> q as close as possible (in the Kullback-Liebler sense) to the one of the training set. <p> f a m k (s 2 ) ;(9) where s 2 = g T a C g a is the (scalar, in this case) variance of a (), and k (s 2 ) , 1 + s 2 =8 2 :(10) This result is intuitively satisfactory: k (s 2 )2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, hence the uncertainty in the input reduces the confidence in the prediction by "pulling" the argument of f () toward 0, and hence the estimated class probability toward 1 2 . This is demonstrated in Figure 4 (left).

Reference-contexts: Model-Based Object Recognition from Range Imagery. Very comprehensive, though rather dated, surveys on techniques for Model-Based Object Recognition (MBOR) can be found in the works by Besl and Jain [6], and Chin and Dyer [20]. A more recent one is in Arman and Aggarwal <ref> [2] </ref>, which focuses on range imagery. In the following we shall often refer to the last two works, integrating with other sources where necessary. In a number of applications, among the goals of a vision system is to identify and locate a specified objects in a scene. <p> Modeling schemes can be broadly classified into three main classes <ref> [2] </ref>: * Surface-based. * Discontinuity-based. * Volumetric-based Surface-based Surface-based schemes use object surface properties, such as surface normal and Gaussian curvature, to approximatively and collectively describe the measured data points.

Reference-contexts: These models are mostly used for shape modeling, rather than recognition, due to their sensitive dependence on the viewpoint. Superquadrics. Known since the XVI century, this class of solid shapes has been introduced in computer graphics by Barr <ref> [3] </ref>, although Pentland's work [59] [60] largely contributed to their diffusion in the computer vision community.

Reference-contexts: Although presenting a thorough probabilistic analysis of the method, the judgement of the final pose estimation results is left to a subjective criterion of acceptability, and no propagation of the pose uncertainty to point predictions is made. A recent work by Bedekar and Haralick <ref> [4] </ref>, although in a different context (the view correspondence problem) proposes a MAP Bayesian approach which is similar in inspiration to the present one.

Reference-contexts: Bergevin, Laurendeau and Poussart <ref> [5] </ref> have tried to eliminate the need for an estimate by correlating the hierarchical triangulations of each view. Soucy and Ferrie [75] introduced a method to cope with non-rigid body motion by calculating a dense grid of motion parameters covering the whole surface.

Reference-contexts: This kind of modelization scheme is mostly useful for model construction (as in CAD/CAM systems), but presents drawbacks as far as recognition is concerned: the object representation is often not unique, and may not model accurately finely sculptured objects with a reasonable number of primitives. Generalized cylinders <ref> [7] </ref> model shape by sweeping along a path in 3-D space (the "spine") a 2-D curve referred as "cross section". Generalized cones are obtained if an omotetic scaling is applied to the swept curve along the spine.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, experiments with variable viewing conditions are not reported. Statistical methods Various recent works in the literature approach explicitly the statistical characterization of pose estimation via a match process. Already in 1986 Bolle and Cooper <ref> [8] </ref> proposed a framework for the ML estimation of the location and orientation of 3-D objects from range data, along with methods for the Bayesian estimation and recognition for large data sets.

Reference-contexts: A superellipsoid in generic position and pose is specified by 11 parameters: the above a; b; c; * 1 ; * 2 , the three coordinates of the center and the three Euler angles of its principal frame w.r.t. the world coordinate system. Boult <ref> [9] </ref>, Bajcsy and Solina [74] and Ferrie et al [27] present frameworks for optimally fitting superellipsoids to depth maps.

Reference-contexts: The major disadvantages of these types of representations are the high construction time, excessive storage requirements for each model, and limited class of objects for which workable solutions are available. An extensive review of these methods can be found in <ref> [10] </ref>. Volumetric representations This class of representations comprises models of the volume occupied by objects rather than their contouring surfaces. Most of these schemes are efficient at describing objects of simple shape ("parts", or articulated models composed of simple parts), and such that symmetries can be exploited.

Reference-contexts: Because of sensor noise and model inaccuracy the optimal models themselves will be generally affected by uncertainty. This can be expressed as an a posteriori (that is, after receiving the data) probability distribution over the models, with the Bayesian interpretation of probability as a measure confidence <ref> [11] </ref> [73] [78]. For the least squares criterion, a Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution is often used, locally in the neighborhood of the optimal model, with covariance matrix equal to the inverse of the Hessian of the fitting cost function at the optimum 3 .

Reference-contexts: Gaussian approximations "in the large") are likely to fail. 4 However, such a probabilistic recognition framework can be cast in terms of powerful connectionist learning and classification algorithms in a rigorous and structured manner <ref> [12] </ref> [54] [80], leading to improved classifier performance. <p> Hence, a proper function is the mean cross-entropy between the labels and the model outputs <ref> [12] </ref> E D (w) = N q k=1 l=1 (k) o l (k) + (1 o l ) log (k) 1 y l * The log priors E W (w) = fflogP (w i jH i ) on the weights.

Reference-contexts: Boult [9], Bajcsy and Solina [74] and Ferrie et al [27] present frameworks for optimally fitting superellipsoids to depth maps.

Reference-contexts: The above steps are repeated for all segments, thus determining all candidate landmark locations and identifications, and consequently all candidate triangles. Finally, the triangle with the highest likelihood is found by maximizing Equation 15, yielding a MAP landmark estimate and its predictive errorbars <ref> [15] </ref>. The classifier used in step 3 is trained o*ine (i.e. once and for all, for a given set of objects), by iterating steps 1 and 2 for several views of each segment.

Reference-contexts: More recently, Camps, Haralick and Shapiro <ref> [16] </ref> use probabilistic evidence to cut-off or prune a search tree. Wheeler and Ikeuchi [87] have proposed an object recognition and pose estimation paradigm for range imagery, based on sensor modeling and probabilistic hypothesis generation.

Reference-contexts: The scale space is a multi-level representation of a shape through successive application of a smoothing operator. The desired effect sought is the elimination of noise while preserving the interesting features assuming that these features exist only within a certain range of scale. Chelberg and Hi <ref> [18] </ref>, for example, have developed a segmentation based implicitly on the scale space by making use of regularization techniques. They proposed a new functional 4 Landmark Identification and Pose Determination in Unstructured Environments that varies the amount of smoothing according to the gradient of the data.

Reference-contexts: It ranges from a simple minimization of the distance between the data points across views to the evaluation of higher level view-invariants (such as surface curvature) that can be matched more accurately across views. 6 Landmark Identification and Pose Determination in Unstructured Environments For instance, Chen and Medioni <ref> [19] </ref> have developed a method that can be used to refine an estimate of motion by minimizing the pixel distance across views. Bergevin, Laurendeau and Poussart [5] have tried to eliminate the need for an estimate by correlating the hierarchical triangulations of each view.

Reference-contexts: Similar to the above tree search approach, several levels of pruning are usually required to reduce the space of possible matches. Among the major works in this area, Fan <ref> [22] </ref> represents objects and models by attributed graphs, where the attributes represent adjacency types (convex, concave, jump and limb), curvature, orientation and distance among centers of inertia.

Reference-contexts: Gaussian Sphere. In particular, in schemes based on the Gaussian sphere concept, surface normals are estimated in correspondence to the data points, or on a regular grid superimposed on them, and each normal is mapped onto the corresponding point of the unit sphere <ref> [23] </ref> [37]. The mapping is strictly local at elliptic and hyperbolic points only, allowing for the unambiguous representation of globally convex objects only. The representation is invariant w.r.t. rotation, but information about object absolute position and overall size is not preserved.

Reference-contexts: Deterministic schemes can be regarded as particular cases with degenerate probability distributions. Theoretical performance limits and criteria can then be stated in a common language (essentially Bayes theorem and its consequences), and approximate performance figures can be assessed for practical purposes <ref> [24] </ref> [70]. Tree search This is a classic deterministic matching technique (the Interpretation Tree made famous by Grimson and Lozano-Perez [30] goes back to 1987), sequential and hierarchical in character.

Reference-contexts: The transitions between stable regions individuate accidental views where the aspect changes rapidly. The first applications considered the simple case of polyhedral objects [61], but more recently applications to curved surfaces have been proposed: generalized cylinders have been considered by Eggert and Bowyer <ref> [25] </ref> and Kriegman and Ponce [46]. The major disadvantages of these types of representations are the high construction time, excessive storage requirements for each model, and limited class of objects for which workable solutions are available. An extensive review of these methods can be found in [10].

Reference-contexts: This quantification of model uncertainty can be effectively exploited along two lines: * For active vision systems, to determine which new sensor positions are most useful to refine the model by further data collection (optimal experiments <ref> [26] </ref>, active data selection [53], autonomous exploration [86]). * For the purposes of model selection (Bayesian "Ockam Razor"), to score alternative models according to both their goodness-of-fit to the data and their relative complex ity [31] [51] [73] [77]. 2.3.3.

Reference-contexts: This is obviously subject to combinatorial explosion, and hence most proposed methods concentrate on techniques for pruning the search tree, thereby pruning the search space. A work representative of this school of thought is Flynn and Jain <ref> [28] </ref>. A match is represented by a triplet (M,A,T), where M is a candidate object model, A is a path in the search tree and T a rigid transformation. The features considered are cylindrical, spherical and planar surface patches, and the tree is constructed using an ordering of sensory data.

Reference-contexts: The intrinsic noisy characteristics of such a map [81] are compensated by combination of the information from the roof and jump edge maps.

Model Matching. The next logical step in MBOR is matching the models recovered from the data with those stored in a previously built database. Matching means establishing, ideally, a one-to-one correspondence between the models recovered from the data and "nominal" models built on database objects.

Superquadric models are recovered by a global-to-local residual-driven procedure.

Literature Review 5 from shading) the uncertainties that exist in range and intensity images are of complementary nature. Lately, a group of researchers <ref> [35] </ref> have tried to put together an objective way of comparing the results of various segmentation algorithms. They made available a set of 40 range images with corresponding ground-truth (manual) segmentation. The evaluation is performed of the basis of five region classifications: correct detection, over-segmentation, under-segmentation, missed and noise.

Reference-contexts: Gaussian Sphere. In particular, in schemes based on the Gaussian sphere concept, surface normals are estimated in correspondence to the data points, or on a regular grid superimposed on them, and each normal is mapped onto the corresponding point of the unit sphere [23] <ref> [37] </ref>. The mapping is strictly local at elliptic and hyperbolic points only, allowing for the unambiguous representation of globally convex objects only. The representation is invariant w.r.t. rotation, but information about object absolute position and overall size is not preserved.

Reference-contexts: The results indicate that the algorithm performs especially well on noisy range images. Traditionally, Gaussian smoothing has been chosen for reason of simplicity to perform scale space mapping. Unfortunately, this operator is known to affect considerably the precise location of the features to be preserved <ref> [49] </ref>. This fact has resulted in complex algorithms to perform feature tracking through scale space [88]. Lejeune and Ferrie [49] have introduced a non-linear diffusion operator whose primary strength resides precisely in its ability to preserve feature location through scale. <p> Unfortunately, this operator is known to affect considerably the precise location of the features to be preserved <ref> [49] </ref>. This fact has resulted in complex algorithms to perform feature tracking through scale space [88].

By construction, this operator is guaranteed to keep untouched regions of interest while quickly filtering out sensor noise and more progressively the surface texture. <p> For our purpose, we consider the range scanner as a black box providing dense range data of a known characteristic error. 3.2. Range Image Segmentation. The range images obtained are segmented using the method developed by Lejeune and Ferrie <ref> [49] </ref>. This strategy makes use of two complementary representations for the surfaces: one that describes local structures in terms of differential properties (e.g. lines, edges, contours) and the other that represents the surface as a collection of smooth patches at different scales.

Reference-contexts: Shimshoni and Ponce's [72] work on 3-D object recognition does actually consider the effect on pose estimation of the uncertainties in recovered feature frames, yet they present results on very simple scenes only, and use computer-intensive techniques (Monte Carlo simulation) to approximate the marginal distributions. Madsen <ref> [56] </ref>, in studying the effect of viewpoint variation on pose estimation, considers the empirical and predictive variances of the pose parameters, but again fails to address their effects on point estimation.

To correct this problem the fitting procedure is often regularized by appropriate functionals. <p> This term expresses prior knowledge about the weights, and acts as a Tichonov regularizer <ref> [62] </ref> applied to E D . The necessity of a regularizer is due to the fact that, during training, the parameters are influenced by the noise on the data as well, thus making an optimum based on E D alone highly sensitive to a particular training set.

Reference-contexts: The work of Lejeune and Ferrie is centered around a definition of an object as a solid mass composed of convex parts. According to this definition, inspired by the work of Hoffman and Richards <ref> [68] </ref>, the boundaries between parts are closed concave valleys. The non-linear diffusion is applied to express the data in the right range of scale and leads to a hybrid representation of the boundaries: edge based and region based.

Reference-contexts: Deterministic schemes can be regarded as particular cases with degenerate probability distributions. Theoretical performance limits and criteria can then be stated in a common language (essentially Bayes theorem and its consequences), and approximate performance figures can be assessed for practical purposes [24] <ref> [70] </ref>. Tree search This is a classic deterministic matching technique (the Interpretation Tree made famous by Grimson and Lozano-Perez [30] goes back to 1987), sequential and hierarchical in character.

Reference-contexts: The result is a segmentation of the range information into approximately planar surface regions. The use of other complementary sources of information such as color or intensity can help in simplifying the problem. For instance, Seetharaman and Chu <ref> [71] </ref> considered the segmentation of a range/intensity image pair of a 3-D scene for model based 3-D object recognition. They noted that, in some cases, at the intermediate levels of abstraction (such as local-shape 2.

Reference-contexts: A superellipsoid in generic position and pose is specified by 11 parameters: the above a; b; c; * 1 ; * 2 , the three coordinates of the center and the three Euler angles of its principal frame w.r.t. the world coordinate system.

Reference-contexts: Kaveti, Khwang and Wang [41] have proposed an algorithm where a combination of split-and-merge and region growing algorithms is performed. Planar regions are extracted first by a clustering approach, wherein, during each iteration the coordinate along which the separation of regions is highest is selected. Taylor, Savini and Reeves <ref> [79] </ref> presented a technique for rapidly dividing surfaces in range imagery into regions satisfying a common homogeneity criterion. The result is a segmentation of the range information into approximately planar surface regions.

Reference-contexts: This quantification of model uncertainty can be effectively exploited along two lines: * For active vision systems, to determine which new sensor positions are most useful to refine the model by further data collection (optimal experiments [26], active data selection [53], autonomous exploration <ref> [86] </ref>). * For the purposes of model selection (Bayesian "Ockam Razor"), to score alternative models according to both their goodness-of-fit to the data and their relative complex ity [31] [51] [73] [77]. 2.3.3.

Reference-contexts: The surviving paths are verified against synthetic images generated from the model database via a CAD system. Tree search is a conservative approach since it considers all possibilities. This is both a strength and a weakness: it is robust at the expense of efficiency <ref> [87] </ref>. Graph matching A different approach consists of determining, both from the recovered and the database models, graphs whose nodes represent surface patches or volumetric parts, and whose arcs represent neighborhood relations among them. <p> More recently, Camps, Haralick and Shapiro [16] use probabilistic evidence to cut-off or prune a search tree.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, Gaussian smoothing has been chosen for reason of simplicity to perform scale space mapping. Unfortunately, this operator is known to affect considerably the precise location of the features to be preserved [49]. This fact has resulted in complex algorithms to perform feature tracking through scale space <ref> [88] </ref>. Lejeune and Ferrie [49] have introduced a non-linear diffusion operator whose primary strength resides precisely in its ability to preserve feature location through scale. By construction, this operator is guaranteed to keep untouched regions of interest while quickly filtering out sensor noise and more progressively the surface texture.

The method has proved to produce stable results even in presence of severe noise. Yokoya and Levine <ref> [89] </ref> also considered a hybrid description of the part boundaries. In this case, the initial region map is extracted from differential properties of the surface (mean and Gaussian curvature map).
