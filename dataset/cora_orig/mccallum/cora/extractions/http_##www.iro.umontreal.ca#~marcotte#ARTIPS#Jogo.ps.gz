Abstract: The linear Bilevel Programming Problem (BLP) is an instance of a linear hierarchical decision process where the lower level constraint set is dependent on decisions taken at the upper level. In this paper we propose to solve this NP-hard problem using an adaptive search method related to the Tabu Search metaheuristic. Numerical results on large scale linear BLPs are presented.

Reference-contexts: If one substitutes to the lower level program the above primal-dual optimality conditions, one obtains the equivalent one-level formulation max c 1 x + d 1 y subject to Ax + By b x; y 0 0 (b Ax By) = 0: As in Anandalingam and White <ref> [1] </ref>, we can penalize the complementarity slack ness terms to obtain the linearly constrained single-level program max x;y; c 1 x + d 1 y M [(B d 2 )y + (b Ax By)] subject to Ax + By b (2) 4 M.

Reference-contexts: Notice that D does not depend on the upper level vector x. The set f (x; y) 2 P jy 2 R (x)g is usually referred to as the induced region. This instance of a linear hierarchical problem was introduced by Candler and Townsley [6], Bard and Falk <ref> [2] </ref> and Bialas and Karwan [5], who solved small test problems. Jeroslow [12] showed that the BLP is NP-hard, while Vicente, Savard and Judice [19] proved that the problem of obtaining a certificate of local optimality for the BLP is also strongly NP-hard.

Reference-contexts: The rationale behind this strategy is to generate a sequence of solutions converging to an (x; y)-solution that satisfies the condition y 2 R (x), while favoring the upper level's objective. This parametric scheme is reminiscent of Bard's efficient point algorithm <ref> [3] </ref> which solves the bicriterion problem max c 1 x + d 1 y + M d 2 y subject to Ax + By b for increasing values of the parameter M , until a rational point (x; y) with y in R (x) is identified.

Reference-contexts: One aim of the present paper is to extend the range of linear BLPs solvable to near-optimality by heuristic methods whose computational growth rate is low.

Reference-contexts: Well-known problems in combinatorial optimization, such as the general linearly-constrained concave quadratic programming problem, or instances of hard mixed-integer problems, can be polynomially reduced to the BLP (see Hansen, Jaumard and Savard <ref> [10] </ref>). Recently, some hope of solving larger problems has been raised, following the works of Bard and Moore [4], Judice and Faustino [13] and Hansen, Jaumard and Savard [10].

Reference-contexts: This program is akin to (2). However this strategy always keeps away from non Pareto-optimal maxima, either local or global (see Haurie, Savard and White <ref> [11] </ref> for a discussion of this topic). This is due to the absence of the correcting term M (b Ax) of (2), and may lead to bad feasible solutions.

Reference-contexts: Like algorithm INIT, algorithm TINI is completed by a local ascent procedure. The overall procedure is illustrated in Figure 2. 3. Numerical results The algorithm has been programmed in the FORTRAN language on a workstation HP730 operating under UNIX, and using Marsten's XMP linear programming code <ref> [14] </ref> for solving the linear subproblems encountered throughout. On the smaller problems, we could compare our algorithm against the exact algorithm of Hansen, Jaumard and Savard [10] programmed within the same computing environment.

Reference-contexts: These are difficult problems that are encountered in some practical situations; for instance, the BLP formulation of the nonparametric discriminant analysis problem leads to 100% dense constraint matrices (see Marcotte and Savard <ref> [16] </ref>). In algorithm INIT, we observed that the penalty became exact for values of M ranging from 2 to 45. In algorithm TINI, the parameter M was initially set to 5, and increased by increments of .5 until the penalty became exact.
