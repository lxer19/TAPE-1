Title: MaxiBook: User-Centered Hypertext on an ASCII Terminal  
Author: Michael L. Littman 
Affiliation: Bellcore Cognitive Science Research  
Abstract: The SuperBook TM1 browser (Remde, Gomez, Landauer, Eberhardt, and Lochbaum, 1987) was developed to provide users with improved online access to structured textual materials. It employs hypertext-like features in a graphical windowing environment to allow users to carry out search and browsing tasks. The MaxiBook project was carried out in order to make the features of the SuperBook browser available to people who do not have access to graphical display terminals. The successful creation of a robust and usable program involved three phases: prototyping in a windowing environment, prototyping in an ASCII terminal environment, and final development. The second and central phase is the topic of this paper.
