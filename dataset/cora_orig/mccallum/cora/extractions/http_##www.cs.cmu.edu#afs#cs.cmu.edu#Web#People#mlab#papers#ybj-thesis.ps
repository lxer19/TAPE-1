Reference-contexts: In view of the redundancy of fingers for a force-closure grasp in some robotic tasks, Abell and Erdmann <ref> [1] </ref> studied the problem of manipulating a polygonal object with the stable support of two frictionless contacts in a fixed gravitational field. An early motivation of our work on mechanics-based observation came from blind grasping. <p> frictionless contact took 1012s. 4 The range of u in terms of the polar angle with respect to the disk center was set to be the interval [80; 100] (degrees); the range of s was determined from the contact edge; the ranges of ! and v T were set as <ref> [1; 1] </ref> (rad=s) and [0:4; 0:4] (cm=s 2 ), which were based on the velocity range of the Adept robot and on our simulation data of pushing. 5 The length of the period can be arbitrarily set but should be large enough.

Reference-contexts: Akella and Mason [3] introduced a complete open-loop (i.e., sensorless) planner that moves a polygon from a known pose to a specified final pose by pushing with a straight fence. Akella et al <ref> [2] </ref> demonstrated that a single joint robot can orient and feed polygon parts up to symmetry by pushing them on a constant speed conveyor belt. <p> even though we do not mention so explicitly. (However, this does not apply to conditions such as E 1 = E 2 where both sides are expressions on angles.) Moreover, intervals for angle values whose left end points are greater than right end points are allowed; for example, an interval <ref> [ 1 ; 2 ] </ref>, where 0 2 &lt; 1 &lt; 2, is understood as the interval union [ 1 ; 2) [ [0; 2 ]. 2.1.1 A Triangle Sliding in a Cone We first deal with the case of a triangle in a cone, not only because it is the <p> 1 = E 2 where both sides are expressions on angles.)

Each generated interval <ref> [ 1 ; 2 ] </ref> now needs to be right-shifted to [ 1 + 0 ; 2 + 0 ].

Reference-contexts: Brost [19] also constructed the same map, which he called the push stability diagram, but in a straightforward way. He used the diagram to plan parallel-jaw grasping of polygonal objects of non-uniform mass density and with bounded location uncertainties.

Reference-contexts: Sliding operations were also first identified in [103] as fundamental to manipulation, and especially to grasping. For unknown centers of friction, Alexander and Maddocks <ref> [4] </ref> reduced the problem of determining the motion of a slider under some applied force to the case of a bipod, offering analytical solutions for simple sliders. <p> This reduction to tripods had been known earlier to Mason [102], though in a slightly different context. For the case of unknown center of friction, Alexander and Maddocks <ref> [4] </ref> proved the reduction of the problem to the case of a bipod, and offered analytical solutions for simple sliders. Lynch [99] showed how to find all feasible motions of a slider that has multiple point contacts with a pusher under an arbitrary motion.

Reference-contexts: This work was extended by Bicchi [16] who offered mathematical solutions to the problem of determining some global quantities of contact between two bodies from force and torque measurements by hard and soft ellipsoidal fingertips. Allen and Roberts <ref> [5] </ref> deployed robot fingers to obtain a number of contact points around an object and then fit (in a least squares manner) the data to a superquadric surface representation to reconstruct the object's shape.

Reference-contexts: This result holds even if all the polygons are convex. Closely related work includes the research by Romanik and others on geometric testability (Romanik [122]; Romanik and Salzberg [123]; Arkin et al. <ref> [6] </ref>). In their research strategies were developed for verifying a given polygon using a series of point probes. Moreover, their research examined the testability of more general geometric objects, such as polyhedra, and develops conditions that determine whether a class of objects is (approximately) testable.

Reference-contexts: They focused on the problem of viewpoint and sensor-type selection and showed that sensor planning can discriminate between objects and their poses that would otherwise be indistinguishable from a fixed viewpoint by any vision-based system. In the meantime, a variety of polygon shape descriptors (Arkin et al. <ref> [7] </ref>; Mumford [107]) were analyzed theoretically and/or demonstrated experimentally to be efficient and robust to uncertainties. Contact positions in our observer-based methods in Chapter 5 are analogous to "features" extracted from object images in object recognition.

Reference-contexts: This result is very similar to our Theorem 3.3. A variation of the line-probing result due to Belleville and Shermer [14] would give us the point sampling result of Theorem 3.3. Arkin et al. <ref> [8] </ref> prove a similar result as well, namely, that the problem of constructing a decision tree of minimum height to distinguish among n polygons using point probes is NP-complete. This result holds even if all the polygons are convex. <p> Following the above theorem, the ratio 2 ln n 1:39 log n of the greedy algorithm for D-Set remains asymptotically optimal if NP is not contained in DTIME (n poly log n ). It should be noted that Arkin et al. <ref> [8] </ref> also exhibit a greedy approximation algorithm for constructing such a decision tree. Their result is similar to our approximation algorithm, with a similar ratio bound.

Reference-contexts: The results of Arora et al. <ref> [9] </ref> imply that no polynomial approximation scheme exists unless P = NP. Based on recent results from interactive proof systems and probabilistically checkable proofs and their connection to approximation, several asymptotic improvements on the hardness of approximating Set Covering have been made.

Reference-contexts: The polygon containment problem, that is, deciding whether an n-gon P can fit into an m-gon Q under translations and/or rotations, has been studied by various researchers in computational geometry (Chazelle [25]; Baker et al. [11]; Fortune [51]; Avnaim and Boisson-nat <ref> [10] </ref>). In the case where Q is convex, the best known algorithm runs in time O (m 2 n) when both translations and rotations are allowed (Chazelle [25]).

Reference-contexts: However, coefficients of friction large enough to violate this condition are often easily encountered in tasks involving rolling or sliding contact with the environment. Baraff <ref> [12] </ref> worked on the problem of computing the contact forces between n rigid bodies in contact at a finite number of points so that any interpenetration between the bodies can be prevented. He showed that deciding the consistency of a given configuration with dynamic friction is NP-complete. <p> The bulk of time is currently spent on the numerical evaluation of the integral of support friction. Similar inefficiency caused by friction also occurs in computing contact forces between rigid bodies in computer graphics (see <ref> [12] </ref>). A deeper understanding of the observer behavior could result in some speedup, though the bottleneck seems to be mechanics-based simulation. The initial pose observer, however, can be efficiently implemented by a table lookup method.

Reference-contexts: In particular, Lund and Yannakakis [96] showed that Set Covering cannot be approximated with ratio c log n for any c &lt; 1 4 unless NP DTIME (n poly log n ); Bellare et al. <ref> [13] </ref> showed that approximating Set Covering within any constant is NP-complete, and approximating it within c log n for any c &lt; 1 8 implies NP DTIME (n log log n ).

Reference-contexts: Besides linearizing nonlinear systems, one approach of nonlinear observer design, called linearization by output injection, was independently proposed by Krener and Isidori [87] for autonomous systems and by Bestle and Zeitz <ref> [15] </ref> for time-varying systems.

Reference-contexts: Donald et al. [38] studied the information structure of cooperative pushing tasks to reorient large objects, demonstrating the equivalences between different types of sensing and communication by sensor reduction. Utilizing the theory of limit surfaces [61], Bohringer et al. <ref> [17] </ref> developed a geometric model for the mechanics of an array of microelectromechan-ical structures and showed how this structure can be used to uniquely align a part up to symmetry. They also offered efficient algorithms to support this new theory of sensorless, parallel manipulation.

Reference-contexts: This work was later extended by Dobkin et al. [37], who investigated the complexity of various models for probing convex polytopes in d-dimensional Euclidean space. Using a more powerful probe model that returns not only the contact points but also the normals at these points, Boissonnat and Yvinec <ref> [18] </ref> showed how to compute the exact shape of a simple polygon as long as some mild conditions about the shape are met.

Reference-contexts: He constructed an algorithm with sub-cubic running time as a proof of sensorless parts orienting. Based on Mason's quasi-static analysis of pushing, Mani and Wilson [101] constructed edge stability maps and developed a planner using them to generate pushing sequences able to orient and position polygon parts. Brost <ref> [19] </ref> also constructed the same map, which he called the push stability diagram, but in a straightforward way. He used the diagram to plan parallel-jaw grasping of polygonal objects of non-uniform mass density and with bounded location uncertainties. <p> See the tray-tilting method (Erdmann and Mason [47]) and the squeeze-grasping method (Brost <ref> [19] </ref>) for examples of the latter case. This fact allows the implementation of more effective sensing mechanisms. The efficiency of such sensing mechanisms depends on both the time cost of the physical operations and the time complexity of the algorithms involved.

Reference-contexts: Howe and Cutkosky [72] experimentally showed that the limit surface only approximates the force-motion relationship for sliding bodies and discussed other simplified practical models for sliding manipulation. Observing the duality between a force and a point, Brost and Mason <ref> [21] </ref> described a graphical method for the analysis of rigid body motion with multiple frictional contacts in the plane.

Reference-contexts: The kinematics of spatial motion with point contact was also studied by Cai and Roth <ref> [22] </ref> who assumed a tactile sensor capable of measuring the relative motion at the contact point. The special kinematics of two rigid bodies rolling on each other was treated by Li and Canny [90] in view of path planning in the contact configuration space. <p> Tournassoud et al. [134] used backward chaining to search for a sequence of stable grasps and placements that enable a parallel-jaw gripper to achieve a desired grasp on a polyhedron. Cole et al. [31] extended Cai and Roth's work <ref> [22] </ref> by also incorporating the dynamics of multifingered hands and objects, as well as the test of grasp stability under Coulomb friction. They developed a control law that allows a grasped object to track a given desired trajectory in the configuration space. <p> Meanwhile, dynamics deals with the rate of change of such relative motion under gravity and contact force (or simply, under the controlled manipulator motion). We refer to the work by Montana [106] and by Cai and Roth <ref> [22] </ref> for detailed treatments of the kinematics of contact between smooth shapes. We also refer to MacMillan's book [100] for a comprehensive introduction to dynamics of rigid bodies that blends analytic methods well with geometric intuition.

Reference-contexts: Donald et al. [39] investigated the relationship among sensing, action, distributed resources, communication paths, and computation in the solution of robot tasks. This work provides a method for comparing disparate sensing strategies, and thus for developing minimal or redundant strategies, as desired. Canny and Goldberg <ref> [24] </ref> introduced a reduced intricacy in sensing and control (RISC) paradigm that aims at improving the accuracy, speed and robustness of sensing by coupling simple and specialized hardware with fast and task-oriented geometric algorithms. <p> It is known that the pose of a planar object, denoted by its position (x; y) and orientation , needs at least three and often four geometric constraints to be fully constrained. Some previous work such as <ref> [24] </ref> and [75] described pose determination strategies using sufficient geometric constraints obtained by sensors. The algorithms employed in these strategies are simple and purely geometric.

Reference-contexts: So we can construct the planar subdivision either in time O (m log m + s) using an optimal algorithm for intersecting line segments by Chazelle and Edelsbrunner <ref> [26] </ref>, or in time O (s log m) using a simpler plane sweep version by Nievergelt and Preparata [109]. To obtain the set of regions each polygon contains, we need only to traverse the portion of the subdivision bounded by that polygon, which takes time O (s).

Reference-contexts: Experiments on a Zebra robot are underway, and the results will be presented in the near future. To generate random polygons, we precomputed an arrangement of a large number (such as 100) of random lines using a topological sweeping algorithm (Edelsbrunner and Guibas <ref> [41] </ref>). A random polygon was extracted as the first "valid" cycle during a random walk on this line arrangement, which was then randomly scaled, rotated, and translated. By "valid" we mean that the number of vertices in the cycle was no less than some small random integer. <p> Section 6.5 discusses sensing ambiguities due to the global object shape. 1 The latter shapes are for the initial pose observer only. 2 The polygons were constructed by taking random walks on the arrangement of a large number of random lines precomputed by a topological sweeping algorithm <ref> [41] </ref>. 89 90 Chapter 6.

Reference-contexts: They used a vibrating box to constrain a part to a small finite number of possible stable poses and then determined the particular pose by a sequence of probes using a tactile sensor. Inspired by their result, Erdmann and Mason <ref> [47] </ref> constructed a planner that employs sensorless tilting operations to orient planar objects randomly dropped into a tray, based on a simple model of the quasi-static mechanics of sliding.

This fact allows the implementation of more effective sensing mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: Therefore a sensing strategy can be realized as an observer of the nonlinear dynamical system. Two observers are subsequently discussed. The first observer, based on the result of <ref> [55] </ref>, has its "gain" determined by the solution of a Lyapunov-like equation. The second observer, based on Newton's method, solves for the initial (motionless) object pose from a few intermediate contact points. <p> Conditions and constructive algorithms were also presented for systems with/without inputs by Xia and Gao [137]. These constructive algorithms find proper changes of coordinates from explicit solutions to certain partial differential equations involving repeated Lie brackets; hence their applicability becomes quite limited. Gauthier, Hammouri, and Othman <ref> [55] </ref> described an observer for affine-control nonlinear systems whose "gain" is determined via the solution of an appropriate Lyapunov-like equation. Their observer is very simple: it is a copy of the original system, together with a linear corrective term that depends only on the state space dimension. <p> Ciccarella et al.

Pose and Motion from Contact Based on the result of <ref> [55] </ref>, we construct an asymptotic nonlinear observer and demonstrate it by simulations. This observer is a composition of a copy of the original system with an error corrective term constructed over the system output and the solution of a Lyapunov-like equation.

Proofs of the above theorem can be found in <ref> [68] </ref> and [110, pp. 95-96].

Reference-contexts: This observer, with provable convergence, iteratively uses Newton's method to modify its state estimate every fixed period of time. However, it intrinsically involves evaluating second order partial derivatives of the drift field of a system, thereby limiting its applicability to mostly simple nonlinear systems. 1.3.7 Contact Kinematics Montana <ref> [106] </ref> derived a set of differential equations that govern the motion of a contact point in response to a relative motion of the objects in contact, and applied these equations to local curvature estimation and contour following. <p> If fi 0 fi 6= 0, the denominator in (5.9) does not vanish for we have fi 0 fi 6= 0 ) fi 0 fi + fi 0 fi 4 The term ff + fi below is the 2-dimensional case of the relative curvature form introduced by Mon tana <ref> [106] </ref>. 5 Here fi is the curvature of the polygon edge in contact with ff. We assume that the finger will not be in contact with any vertex during the pushing. 72 Chapter 5. <p> Meanwhile, dynamics deals with the rate of change of such relative motion under gravity and contact force (or simply, under the controlled manipulator motion).

Reference-contexts: They focused on the problem of viewpoint and sensor-type selection and showed that sensor planning can discriminate between objects and their poses that would otherwise be indistinguishable from a fixed viewpoint by any vision-based system. In the meantime, a variety of polygon shape descriptors (Arkin et al.

Contact positions in our observer-based methods in Chapter 5 are analogous to "features" extracted from object images in object recognition.

Reference-contexts: Introduction bodies in contact with Coulomb friction have a unique solution if the the system Jacobian matrix has full column rank and the coefficients of friction are small enough. This result was obtained by Pang and Trinkle <ref> [113] </ref> who introduced complementarity formulations of the problem. In the second part of the thesis we assume that the solution to rigid body dynamics has both existence and uniqueness. It is known, however, that when Coulomb friction is considered, this assumption can be violated.

Reference-contexts: Given some (e.g., constant) friction distribution, the sliding problem of solving for the motion of a slider under some applied force becomes that of determining the set of instantaneous rotation centers for all pressure distributions. For the case of a known center of friction, Peshkin and Sanderson <ref> [116] </ref> solved the sliding problem by a reduction to the case of a tripod of support, with two or three points on the boundary of the support region, and one or zero point at the rotation center.

Reference-contexts: To cope with the uncertainty in the initial pose of a workpiece and the unknown details about the contact between the workpiece and the plane, Peshkin and Sanderson <ref> [117] </ref> introduced a configuration map that describes the geometrical and physical consequence of one manipulation operation.

Since the supporting cone of P from a point can be constructed in time O (log n) using binary search (Preparata and Shamos <ref> [118] </ref>), the running time of the algorithm is O ((k 1)n + (m k + 1) log n) (i.e., O (mn) in the worst case), where k is the value of variable i when leaving Step 2.

For the special case that the poses are finite, an efficient method was presented by Rao and Goldberg <ref> [119] </ref>. It places a registration mark on the object so that the pose can be recognized by locating the mark position with a simple vision system.

The cross-beam sensing method developed by Wallack et al. <ref> [136] </ref> computes the orientation of a polygon from its diameters measured along three different directions, making use of a precomputed diameter function [58]. The idea of characterizing shapes with diameters and chords was also addressed earlier by Sinden [129].

Reference-contexts: Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such transformation for autonomous nonlinear systems without input were given in [87], and in [88] by Krener and Respondek along with a constructive algorithm. Conditions and constructive algorithms were also presented for systems with/without inputs by Xia and Gao <ref> [137] </ref>. These constructive algorithms find proper changes of coordinates from explicit solutions to certain partial differential equations involving repeated Lie brackets; hence their applicability becomes quite limited.

Reference-contexts: situation was avoided in our simulations. 10 The construction of the internal skeleton of a polygon is a special case of the construction of the generalized Voronoi diagram for a set of line segments for which O (n log n) algorithms were given by Kirkpatrick [85], Fortune [52], and Yap <ref> [138] </ref>. A linear time algorithm on finding the medial axis of a simple polygon was recently given by Chin et al. [28].

Reference-contexts: An approach to observer design utilizing the Lyapunov theory was introduced early on by Thau [133] but requires a good guess regarding a Lyapunov function. 1.3. Related Research 13 Zimmer <ref> [140] </ref> designed a state estimator that conducts on-line minimization over some objective function. This observer, with provable convergence, iteratively uses Newton's method to modify its state estimate every fixed period of time.

Reference-contexts: Erdmann [45] developed a working system for orienting parts using two palms, together with frictional contact analysis tools that can predict relative slip between parts. The work demonstrates the feasibility of automatic nonprehensile palm manipulation. Zumel <ref> [141] </ref> demonstrated that a part can be manipulated by a two degree-of-freedom palm and gave a planning algorithm based on an analysis of the mechanics of the nonprehensile contacts between the part and the palm.
