Abstract: In this paper, we consider non-uniform wire-sizing. Given a wire segment of length L, let f(x) be the width of the wire at position x, 0 x L. We show that the optimal wire-sizing function that minimizes the Elmore delay through the wire is f(x) = ae bx , where a &gt; 0 and b &gt; 0 are constants that can be computed in O(1) time. In the case where lower bound (L &gt; 0) and upper bound (U &gt; 0) on the wire widths are given, we show that the optimal wire-sizing function f(x) is a truncated version of ae bx that can also be determined in O(1) time. Our wire-sizing formula can be iteratively applied to optimally size the wire segments in a routing tree.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction As VLSI technology continues to scale down, interconnect delay has become the dominant factor in deep submi-cron designs. As a result, wire-sizing plays an important role in achieving desirable circuit performance. Recently, many wire-sizing algorithms have been reported in the literature <ref> [1, 2, 4, 5, 7] </ref>. All these algorithms size each wire segment uniformly, i.e., identical width at every position on the wire. In order to achieve non-uniform wire-sizing, existing algorithms have to chop wire segments into large number of small segments.

Recently, <ref> [2] </ref> presents a wire-sizing algorithm GWSA-C for sizing the wire segments in routing trees. Each segment in the tree is sized uniformly, i.e. uniform wire width per segment. Basically, GWSA-C is an iterative algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a global optimal solution.
