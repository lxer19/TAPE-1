Abstract: In the future, the amount of online information will increase as more people use the Internet for a growing number of activities. Staying updated on the status of important information requires a tool that will monitor information resources and alert the user when changes occur. To remain both useful and unintrusive, such a tool must provide quick access to information in a small space. To address this need, we created Irwin, a highly configurable information monitoring tool. This paper describes Irwin and examines how four users used it over a five-month period.

Reference-contexts: In a WIMP environment they can both provide information and invite the user to click to obtain more information. Studies have shown that changing the appearance of icons can convey additional information about their use; for example, animated icons <ref> [1] </ref> convey more information about the functionality of tools in a tool palette than a static image. While Irwin does not use animated icons, it does change the color and appearance of icons based on the contents of the information resources they represent.

Reference-contexts: They may be the only way the user knows about the change if the display is obscured or if the user is not looking at the screen. Auditory cues have proven useful in both enhancing and replacing visual cues in user interfaces <ref> [3, 2] </ref>. Based on these previous results, we felt it would be useful to allow users to combine an auditory cue with the visual icon change. We selected sounds that are distinctive but are not distracting and, most importantly, are short.

Reference-contexts: One method used in read wear and edit wear [7] is to represent the text with a line of pixels. Characteristics like length and color correspond to properties of the text such as the number of modifications. The SeeSoft <ref> [4] </ref> and RunView [8] software visualization programs represent code with lines of pixels. The length of the line can correspond to the length of the line or function, and the color can correspond to the author, module name, or modification date.

Reference-contexts: The luxuries provided by reduced-space information visualization techniques may become necessities in the near future.

However, these typically generate text-only output, which would be difficult for users to assimilate in a small space.

Reference-contexts: We expect that over time some users will turn off this syntactic encoding and use keyword matching only. We considered using a fisheye view <ref> [6] </ref> to show all of the list items at once. In a fisheye view, the size and position of the graphical representation are dependent upon the location of the focus. This allows both focus and context to be shown simultaneously.

Reference-contexts: To accomplish this, we need a graphical method for reducing a line or word of text into a set of pixels. One method used in read wear and edit wear <ref> [7] </ref> is to represent the text with a line of pixels. Characteristics like length and color correspond to properties of the text such as the number of modifications. The SeeSoft [4] and RunView [8] software visualization programs represent code with lines of pixels.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, we introduce Irwin, an awareness tool which uses many of these techniques, and we describe a case study that examines how four people used Irwin in their workplaces over a five-month period.

Irwin consists of a set of hypertools-small reusable programs that can run simultaneously and share information.
