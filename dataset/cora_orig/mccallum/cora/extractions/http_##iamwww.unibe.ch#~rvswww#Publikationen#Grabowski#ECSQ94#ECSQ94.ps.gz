Abstract: The test of a communication system is a complex procedure which comprises several phases with various tasks. The quality of a test depends on the work in the phases and an easy and smooth transition between the phases. In the current test practice the different phases are mainly based on informal documents and they do not always fit together properly. Therefore we intend to improve the phases and the transition between the phases. This paper shows how the use of Message Sequence Charts (MSCs) may improve the test specification phase and facilitate the transition to the test implementation phase. We describe the different phases of testing, sketch the problems of practical testing, and explain the use of MSCs for test specification by the example of an ISDN switching system. We show how MSC based test specifications can be transformed into executable test cases, and present a tool set which supports the test specification and automates the test implementation.

We want to test the functions of the layer 3 protocol Q.931 <ref> [CCI89] </ref> within a Line Trunk Group (LTG) of an ISDN 2 switching system. The Q.931 protocol is implemented within the LTG and there is no direct access to this implementation. Furthermore, each LTG has only one standardized interface which may be connected to an ISDN end system (e.g. a telephone).

Reference-contexts: The transition from the analysis phase to the specification phase is the simplest transition of all, because both phases use text based documents. For test case specification, informal diagrams as shown at the bottom of Figure 4 are widely used and well accepted in the telecommunication area <ref> [GGR93] </ref>. They describe the message flow at the interfaces of the system which shall be tested. Often they are enriched with informal presuppositions. Figure 4 provides a complete example of such a test case description. The test case EDSAOUX is taken from the Layer 3 test suite for the LTG.

Reference-contexts: The tax units are set for time rates of 0,3 Rp/s. Control: Observation of the tax display General message flow: 3 Using MSC for test case specification In our method we use the Message Sequence Chart (MSC) language for the specification of test cases. MSC has been standardized in <ref> [ITU92] </ref>. An MSC diagram is very similar to the notation already used for test case specification purposes. A comparison of the test specification in Figure 4 and the MSC 3 in Figure 6 shows the similarities and differences. <p> The reference to TTCN is optional. Other data description languages can be taken instead, using the same mechanism. 3.1 Adapting MSCs for the needs of testing The MSC standard is provided by the ITU-T recommendation Z.120 <ref> [ITU92] </ref>. The MSC recommendation includes two syntactical forms: MSC/PR as pure textual and MSC/GR as graphical representation. An MSC in MSC/GR representation can be transformed automatically into a corresponding MSC/PR representation. We use the graphical form in the test case specification and base our algorithms on the MSC/PR form. <p> Within an MSC the statements of RL are related to messages. They can be found in parentheses near the corresponding message name, or message arrow (cf. Figure 6). This is no extension of the MSC language, because the MSC standard <ref> [ITU92] </ref> proposes to use expressions in round brackets to assign parameter information to messages.

Reference-contexts: TTCN has become very popular in the telecommunications area. Although TTCN is intended to be used as a test case specification language, it has been recognized, that it can also be used as test case implementation language. As a consequence there already exist compilers for different test devices, e.g. <ref> [Sie93] </ref>. For complete test cases it is necessary to describe the parameter values of the exchanged messages. Since the standardized MSC language includes no possibility for data 3 The term MSC is used for a diagram written in the MSC language and the language itself.
