Abstract: We describe the queue management block of ATLAS I , a single-chip ATM switch (router) with optional credit-based (backpressure) flow control. ATLAS I is a 4-million-transistor 0.35-micron CMOS chip, currently under development, offering 20 Gbit/s aggregate I/O throughput, sub-microsecond cut-through latency, 256-cell shared buffer containing multiple logical output queues, priorities, multicasting, and load monitoring. The queue management block of ATLAS I is a dual parallel pipeline that manages the multiple queues of ready cells, the per-flow-group credits, and the cells that are waiting for credits. All cells, in all queues, share one, common buffer space. These 3- and 4-stage pipelines handle events at the rate of one cell arrival or departure per clock cycle, and one credit arrival per clock cycle. The queue management block consists of two compiled SRAM's, pipeline bypass logic, and multi-port CAM and SRAM blocks that are laid out in full-custom and support special access fl Copyright 1997 IEEE.

Reference-contexts: This 16x16 switch uses point-to-point serial links running at 622 Mbits/s each (link bundling also allows configurations of 8x8 at 1.25 Gbps/link, 4x4 at 2.5 Gbps/link, etc.). The links run ATM on top of IEEE Std. 1355 HIC/HS <ref> [1] </ref> as physical layer, using the BULL STRINGS GBaud serial-link transceivers [15]. HIC was preferred over SONET because of simpler circuitry, lower latency, and the capability to encode (unbundled) credits.

Reference-contexts: Mul-tilane (per-connection) backpressure fixes this problem: connections or groups of connections are queued and flow-controlled independent of each other, allowing the selective bypassing of cells, according to priorities and feedback from downstream congestion. The credit protocol of ATLAS I is reminiscent of QFC <ref> [2] </ref>, but is adapted to hardware implementation over short and reliable links. 2 Provision of credit-based flow control offers significant advantages [13] [8], and places important requirements on the queue management circuits of ATLAS I (section 3).

Reference-contexts: Contemporary VLSI technology provides the necessary capacity to fit such advanced switches on a single-chip, thus avoiding the high cost and performance bottlenecks of multi-chip organizations. Hardware management of non-trivial data structures inside VLSI switches has appeared before in wormhole routers, e.g. [20], <ref> [3] </ref>, [7]. VLSI ATM switches have also been developed, e.g. [11], [18], [6]. Relative to such previous work, ATLAS I differs as follows. <p> The ATLAS switch implements multilane credit-based flow control (section 2), while other switches either provide no flow control at all [6] [11] [20], or only single-lane flow control [18]. Certain wormhole routers, like iWarp <ref> [3] </ref> and Spider [7], support multi-lane backpressure flow control for a small number of channels or flow-groups, and implement queuing with a dedicated fixed-sized buffer per channel.

Reference-contexts: Today, with the advent of gigabit networking, with the desire for improved QoS including short latency, and with the resulting small cell/flit size, high-performance switching has to be implemented in hardware [22], and switches must employ flexible data-structures for the cells stored in them, which were not necessary before <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Improved QoS requires, on one hand, reduced latency for high-priority traffic. Among others, this means preemptive scheduling, i.e. packet switching based on small-size quanta. In two popular technologies, this is achieved using cells in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) [14] or flits in Wormhole Routing <ref> [5] </ref>. An ATM switch is a system that buffers and routes ATM cells, i.e. fixed-size quanta consisting of a 5-byte header and a 48-byte payload each. User packets are segmented into cells at the source, and reassembled from cells at their final destination. <p> One of the most distinctive features of ATLAS I is its (optional) provision of credit-based flow control (mul-tilane backpressure). Under backpressure <ref> [5] </ref>, cells are never dropped, because they are only transmitted when buffer space is known to exist at the receiver (i.e. after having acquired a credit). Single-lane backpres-sure indiscriminately starts or stops the transmission of any cell according to buffer space availability; it performs poorly due to head-of-line blocking effects.

Thus, the design of the central controller is more of a challenge, but it is doable and advantageous, as we show in this paper.
