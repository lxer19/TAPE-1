Abstract: Genesis and ATIS are being developed under the umbrella of the Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems 1 to facilitate various kinds of travel, including daily commuting to work via private/public transportation and visiting new places and points of attraction. Travelers are naturally mobile, and the most effective way to aid travelers is via mobile computing, which is being explored in the Genesis project at Minnesota. The travelers can use personal communication devices including pagers and portable computers (e.g. Apple Newton) to avail themselves of the ATIS services provided by Genesis. This extended abstract presents an overview of the goals and preliminary design of Genesis. We believe that ATIS provides a very important commercial application of mobile computing and can be the killer application to bring mobile computing to mass markets. This paper focuses on describing the application domain rather than evaluating candidate solutions.

Reference-contexts: PCDs are divided into three categories, an alphanumeric pager, a hand-held PDA (Personal Device Assistant) and a PDA off-the shelf information device. 2.2 Genesis System Functionality 6 application functions include the user profile, trip planning, trip scheduling, trip status, travel time advisory, real-time advisory, planned events and transit applications <ref> [1] </ref>. The User Profile function allows the user to maintain default travel time preferences, alarm parameters and advisory recognition preferences. Travel time preferences include desired starting or stopping time of trip, travel duration, etc. Advisory parameters include travel duration, bus exceptions, real-time, and planned event advisories. <p> Trip status allows the user to receive travel duration, real-time, planned event, and bus exception advisories, etc. Figure 4 shows the Trip Management function <ref> [1] </ref> in Genesis. The Incident Reports function receives and displays real-time location-specific incident information from the fixed-end server. Incident information includes potential hazards or delays due to unusual occurrences such as traffic accidents or excessive congestion. Incident reports include travel duration advisories and real-time advisories. <p> These aggregate properties may include travel time, travel distance and traffic congestion information. The set of possible candidate routes are those familiar routes selected by travelers, or the most frequently used routes automatically recorded by ATIS. As shown in figure 6, Genesis provides the route planning function <ref> [1] </ref>, which uses route evaluation to estimate the travel time on routes. The following two examples illustrate the route evaluation queries. Route evaluation requires 11 less computation and I/O overhead than route computation, since only a very small number of routes are examined. <p> In addition, Genesis will provide a route status function that is triggered automatically by a change in traffic conditions on the primary route, or triggered manually by a primary-route status request. Figure 7 shows the trip status function <ref> [1] </ref> in Genesis. A driver might specify the following trigger to change the primary route if the travel duration on the primary route drops below a threshold. This trigger uses route evaluation to find the travel duration for routes.

Reference-contexts: The market for ATIS products is likely to grow rapidly in the US, and a widening market for route guidance systems already exists in Japan <ref> [3] </ref>. ATIS is an application naturally suited for mobile computing technology 2 . 2 Travel-based professionals such as traveling salespersons are likely to find it easier to justify the acquisition of mobile computing equipment than are other professionals.

Reference-contexts: Genesis is likely to open up a killer application requiring mobile database technology. Mobile database technology such as caching, data replication, indexing strategies, and tracking strategies including location updates and queries for mobile users, etc. <ref> [9, 4, 7, 11, 10, 8] </ref>, are relevant to the design of Genesis. We note that Genesis is still in the preliminary design phase, so it is premature to compare it with other related work in mobile databases. <p> ATIS should be able to provide different qualities of service to meet different clients' needs. * Disconnection : It is often assumed that mobile clients may frequently be disconnected to save power <ref> [4, 9] </ref>, and effective caching algorithms need to be designed based on the disconnection time. Extended disconnection to save power may not be an issue in ATIS, since the vehicle can provide adequate power. However, disconnection may occur due to tunnels and other obstructions to communications. <p> Clients cache data and query results in local disk storage that is available to clients. This strategy requires the PCD to be capable of processing queries such as route guidance, route computation and evaluation, etc. Caching strategies using broadcasting and signature, etc., are discussed in <ref> [4] </ref>. In an enhanced client-server architecture, the client will request data from the server if data is not available in the client caches. In a page-based environment, the server will not just return the requested data, but will return all data stored in the same page as the requested data.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) is one facet of the Intelligent Vehicle Highway System (IVHS) [2], which is currently being developed to improve the safety and efficiency of automobile travel. ATIS assists travelers with planning, perception, analysis and decision-making to improve the convenience, safety and efficiency of travel <ref> [6, 14, 5, 17, 12] </ref>. ATIS applications create a shared resource for efficient mobile computation and data integration. As shown in figure 1, ATIS obtains information from different sources, including traffic reports, scheduled traffic events, sensors and maps, etc. Periodic sensor data might lead to high update rates.

TravTek is a joint public sector-private sector project to develop, test and evaluate an ATIS in Orlando, Florida. TravTek provides several major tasks including navigation, route selection, route guidance, local information, driver interfacing, probe reporting, and data logging. <p> A control center manages the communication, detects traffic density and vehicle speeds, and transmits congestion information to the special vehicles in the form of an electronic map on a display screen or a digital voice. A variety of projects are also underway in Europe and Japan <ref> [2, 6] </ref>. ALI-SCOUT/LISB uses infrared transmitters and receivers to transfer navigation information between roadside beacons and equipped vehicles. The Autoguide being developed in British is similar to ALI-SCOUT.

Several approaches to wireless communication are being explored, including Infrared and RF beacon technologies, FM sideband technology, Mobile satellite services, Cellular phone technology and Radio-Frequency (RF) data communication networks <ref> [12] </ref>. The User interface function communicates with the user (driver), accepting requests for service and delivering driving directions and other information. Direction screens present simple, highly stylized graphics that can be taken in at a glance.

Reference-contexts: The choice of placing data to pages affects the query processing performance. We have proposed connectivity-clustered access methods (CCAM) to provide efficient management of road-map databases and thus reduce the number of pages accessed during updates, route evaluation, etc [16]. Lastly, parallel processing <ref> [13, 19] </ref> may be used to scale up to a realistic number of traveling events and to provide each with a reasonable response time. Enhanced Client-Server Query processing can be executed locally by the clients (PCDs). The work load in the server is reduced by distributing database operations to clients.

Reference-contexts: In a page-based environment, data is stored in the system's secondary storage, which consists of fixed, uniform-size pages. The main overhead during route computation or route evaluation is disk I/O. We have evaluated the performance of path computation algorithms on road map databases <ref> [15] </ref>. The choice of placing data to pages affects the query processing performance. We have proposed connectivity-clustered access methods (CCAM) to provide efficient management of road-map databases and thus reduce the number of pages accessed during updates, route evaluation, etc [16].
