Abstract: Category: algorithms and architectures | recurrent networks. No part of this paper has been submitted elsewhere. Preference: poster. Abstract Existing proofs demonstrating the computational limitations of the Recurrent Cascade Correlation (RCC) Network (Fahlman, 1991) explicitly limit their results to units having sigmoidal or hard-threshold transfer functions (Giles et al., 1995; and Kremer, 1996). The proof given here shows that, for any given finite, discrete, deterministic transfer function used by the units of an RCC network, there are finite-state automata (FSA) that the network cannot model, no matter how many units are used. The proof applies equally well to continuous transfer functions with a finite number of fixed-points, such as the sigmoid function.
