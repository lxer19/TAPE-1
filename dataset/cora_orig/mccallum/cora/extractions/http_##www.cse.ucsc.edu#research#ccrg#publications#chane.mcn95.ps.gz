Abstract: We specify and analyze a new channel access protocol for wireless local area networks. The new protocol, FAMA-PJ, consists of both carrier sensing and a collision detection mechanism based on control packets and jamming that prevent collision of data packets with control or data packets from other stations. Control of the channel (which we call the floor) is assigned to at most one station in the network at a time, and this station is guaranteed to be able to transmit one or more data packets to different destinations with no collision with transmissions from other stations. The minimum control packet size required to enforce correct floor control is specified as a function of the channel propagation delay and transmit to receive turn around time. The throughput and delay of FAMA-PJ are analyzed and compared with the throughput and delay of non-persistent CSMA. This analysis shows that FAMA-PJ can provide similar or better throughput than non-persistent CSMA in a high-speed wireless local area network, and that is more stable and has better delay characteristics than non-persistent CSMA.

Reference-contexts: Because MACA does not use the carrier sense principle, it can be shown that MACA will allow collisions of the data packets and therefore is not safe [6]. An extension to MACA titled MACAW (MACA for Wireless) has also been proposed <ref> [1] </ref>. A version of CSMA with a four-way handshake for collision avoidance has been proposed for the IEEE 802.11 [3, 7].

A number of protocols, including MACA and IEEE 802.11 <ref> [5, 8, 1, 15] </ref> use a three or four-way handshake between sender and receiver to avoid collisions. <p> This three or four-way handshake amounts to collision detection by the receiver and addresses, at least to some degree, two main problems: (a) The half-duplex nature of single-channel wireless networks, and (b) The hidden-terminal effect <ref> [17, 1] </ref>, which inhibits the transmitter's ability to detect that its intended receiver is receiving multiple transmissions. <p> Other backoff strategies can also be used (e.g., see <ref> [1] </ref>). 3 Floor Assignment in FAMA-PJ The size of the RTS packets in relation to the data packets is critical to the efficient operation of the protocol.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, these protocols do not guarantee that a station can sense all collisions [13]. Another CSMA/CA protocol based on the idea of sending a request signal and pausing to sense collisions was proposed and analyzed in <ref> [5, 2] </ref>. This protocol, however, was designed for LANs in which stations can sense the channel while transmitting. FAMA-PJ differs from the Lo and Rom protocols in that it enforces floor acquisition and uses jamming from both active and passive stations (i.e., stations involved in sending packets or simply listening).

Reference-contexts: On the arrival of the data packet, the station finds the channel busy with probability P B and incur a partial transmission period. Because the arrival process is Poisson, arrival times during any given time interval are independent and uniformly distributed <ref> [18] </ref>. Therefore, on the average, the partial transmission period the station experiences is T P =2, where T P is the duration of an average transmission period. The station will then transition to the BACKOFF state.
