Note: 1 of 12  1.0 Introduction  
Abstract: Traditionally, application specific computations have been focusing on numerically intensive data manipulation. Modern communications and DSP applications, such as WWW, interactive high resolution TV, video-on-demand, and wireless communications, however, are increasingly more data management oriented. At the same time, the technological tr ends indicate that magnetic disk system performance is rapidly becoming a principal component in overall system behavior. In this paper, we initiate behavioral and system level r esearch in synthesis of disk-based application specif ic system by introducing cost and throughput optimization problems for synthesis of disk-based application specific systems (DASS). We formulate, establish computational complexity, and develop ef ficient optimization algorithms for data assignment on a single and multiple disks so that the seek time over head is minimized. Extensive experimental results clearly indicate the importance of the synthesis pr oblem and effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithms. The rapidly increasing importance of massive storage systems in application specif ic systems is the consequence of convergence of application and technological tr ends. Both recent trends and future market prediction indicate that emphasis in application specif ic systems has been shifting fr om the data manipulation paradigm to the data management paradigm. Internet-based applications (e.g. world wide web), video-on-demand, interactive television, and wireless communications are only a subset of exciting and economically important modern data-management based application specific systems. At the same time, all technology tr ends also indicate that key design metrics of modern and futur e application specific designs, such as throughput, latency, power, weight, and cost, will be dominated by massive storage elements. Both modern micr oprocessor and ASIC technology is advancing at exponential rates and speedups of more than 50% compounded annually have become the standard. Although, disk capacity increase and disk cost decr ease follow even faster tr ends (between 60 and

Lastly, we provide our optimization strategies for the problem. 4.1 Problems Formulation The throughput optimization using positioning pr oblem is defined using the standar d Garey-Johnson <ref> [Gar79] </ref> format. Problem: Disk Head Movement Minimization using Positioning Instance: Given a schedule of tasks, the data requirements of the tasks and a disk which just fits in all data blocks. <p> When a graph G is not weighted and each task requires only one track for its data, the resulting problem is reduced to the Optimal Linear Arrangement which is NP-complete <ref> [Gar79] </ref>. For a special case when the graph of n nodes is a tr ee, there exists an optimal algorithm whose running time is O (nlogn) [Ado73]. The Disk Head Movement Minimization Using Positioning and Partitioning pr oblem can be also reformulated using the similar graph-theor etic abstraction. <p> We proved, using the standard Karps polynomial reduction technique that the Disk Head Movement Minimization Using Positioning problem is NP-complete, with the transformation fr om a known NP-complete pr oblem, Optimal Linear Arrangement <ref> [Gar79] </ref> into an instance of our problem. 4.4 Optimization Strategy Since the computational complexity of the thr oughput optimization problem forbids an exact or optimal solution, an efficient and effective heuristic method has been developed for the problem.
