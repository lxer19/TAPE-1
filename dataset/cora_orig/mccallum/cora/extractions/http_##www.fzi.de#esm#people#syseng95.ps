Reference-contexts: Also, software design concentrates on the functional aspects, leaving the proof for correct performance up to the final lifecycle phases. The current development approach bears a reasonable risk not to meet the requirements or to have given wrong or incomplete requirements due to late validation. In the OMBSIM study <ref> [1] </ref> it was investigated how the current development approach can be improved. Main aspects were coherent consideration of functionality, behaviour and performance, hardware and software, and a coherent transition between specification and design and traversing through system hierarchy levels.

Reference-contexts: As no tools were available on commercial market which covered sufficiently functional and performance aspects together with aspects of verification and validation two tools were coupled. For behavioural and functional aspects the SDL-tool GEODE <ref> [2] </ref> from Verilog is used extended by the performance simulation tool SES/workbench [3]. Add-on software had to be developed to complement the tools by additonal validation capabilities and to provide tool coupling [4].

In chapter 3 the pilot application is described and results are presented. <p> SES/workbench allows to generate behavioural VHDL. Recently, a step has been made by Dornier towards an automated transition from SDL to VHDL [6] from a system's point of view based on the experience from previous activities [7,8]. More information about EaSySim can be found in <ref> [4] </ref> and [9]. 3. THE PILOT APPLICATION As pilot application the FDIR component of the CLUSTER Data Management System (DMS) was selected. Although this component represents only a small part of the CLUSTER onboard DMS, the complete DMS had to be modeled in a representative manner.

Reference-contexts: Steps 3 and 4 are compliant with the principal ideas of HOOD <ref> [5] </ref>. 2.2 The Tool Environment EaSySim The proof for correctness and consistency of specification and design shall be given by execution of models and operational scenarios, i.e. by means of simulation.

Reference-contexts: For efficient modelling appropriate techniques have to be identified and applied. Especially, design for reuse is essential, but not so easy to achieve. Therefore one has carefully to consider modelling progress and to introduce better techniques, when needed. By the activities performed for OMBSIM and the previous HRDMS project <ref> [10] </ref> sufficient experience on this subject is available now. Moreover, it was identified that activation - deactivation of a component is not a matter of the architecure only, but also a matter of design. This has to be applied consequently. - 11 - (C) All Rights Resevered Dornier Satellitensysteme GmbH 1995
