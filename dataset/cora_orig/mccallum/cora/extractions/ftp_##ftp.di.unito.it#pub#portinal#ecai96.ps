Title: On the Usefulness of Re-using Diagnostic Solutions  
Author: Luigi Portinale and Pietro Torasso 
Abstract: Recent studies on planning, comparing plan re-use and plan generation, have shown that both the above tasks may have the same degree of computational complexity, even if we deal with very similar problems. The aim of this paper is to show that the same kind of results apply also for diagnosis. We propose a theoretical complexity analysis coupled with some experimental tests, intended to evaluate the adequacy of adaptation strategies which re-use the solutions of past diagnostic problems in order to build a solution to the problem to be solved. Results of such analysis show that, even if diagnosis re-use falls into the same complexity class of diagnosis generation (they are both NP-complete problems), practical advantages can be obtained by exploiting a hybrid architecture combining case-based and model-based diagnostic problem solving in a unifying framework.

Reference-contexts: We can show that the NP-completeness property also holds for DIAGSAT. Theorem 1 DIAGSAT is NP-complete. Proof. First we prove that DIAGSAT is NP-hard by means of a reduction from SAT (the problem of deciding the satisfiability of a boolean formula in CNF) that is known to be NP-complete <ref> [1] </ref>. Let be a boolean formula in CNF with variables V = fv 1 ; v 2 ; : : : v n g and clauses C = fc 1 ; c 2 ; : : : c m g.

Reference-contexts: If H is a partial diagnosis, then H is the set of total diagnoses generated from H. Notice that H = ; is meaningless since, in the above characterization, this case would correspond to OBS = ; and consequently the diagnostic problem should not arise. 3 Complexity Results In <ref> [3] </ref> it is shown that, apart from particular restrictions, solving an abductive problem is in general an NP-hard problem. Diagnostic problems satisfying definition 1 can be viewed as a kind of problems classified in [3] as incompatibility abduction problems: incompatibility relations are represented by the fact that different ground instances of <p> to OBS = ; and consequently the diagnostic problem should not arise. 3 Complexity Results In <ref> [3] </ref> it is shown that, apart from particular restrictions, solving an abductive problem is in general an NP-hard problem. Diagnostic problems satisfying definition 1 can be viewed as a kind of problems classified in [3] as incompatibility abduction problems: incompatibility relations are represented by the fact that different ground instances of the same abducible predicate are incompatible. In the following, when we will refer to a diagnostic problem we will consider a problem satisfying definition 1. <p> Proposition 1 CONCHECK, COVCHECK and DIAGCHECK are in P Let us then consider the following decision problem. Definition 4 DIAGSAT is the decision problem consisting of determining whether an instance of a diagnostic problem DP = hM; HY P; CXT; hY + ; Y ii has a solution. In <ref> [3] </ref>, incompatibility abduction problems have been proved to be NP-hard in general, with some special class of incompatibility problems (i.e. independent incompatibility abduction problems) being NP-complete. We can show that the NP-completeness property also holds for DIAGSAT. Theorem 1 DIAGSAT is NP-complete. Proof.

Reference-contexts: The framework has been initially proposed in <ref> [5] </ref> as a general approach able to unify classical approaches to model-based diagnosis (namely purely consistency-based and purely abductive diagnosis). <p> constraint holds for every predicate symbol p: p (x) ^ p (y) ! ? (x 6= y) A set of ground atoms is consistent if and only if it does not violate the above constraint. 2 Different choices of Y + give raise to quite different definitions of diagnosis (see <ref> [5] </ref>), ranging from purely abductive definitions (Y + = OBS) to purely consistency-based definitions (Y + = ;). 3 Therefore, M is equivalent to a propositional definite clause theory. c fl 1996 L.

Since it is well-known that verifying whether a given atom is a consequence of a set of propositional definite clauses is linear in the size of the set of clauses <ref> [6] </ref>, we have the following proposition. Proposition 1 CONCHECK, COVCHECK and DIAGCHECK are in P Let us then consider the following decision problem.

Reference-contexts: However, recent investigations on case-based planning have shown that the theoretical computational complexity of re-using plans of previously solved problems is in general at least as hard as generating the plans from scratch <ref> [9] </ref>. In particular, this may happen even if the problem for which a plan exists is very similar to the problem to be solved (intuitively, adaptation of the plan to the new problem should be easy in such a case) . <p> We are essentially interested in studying adaptation strategies that can be classified as deletion and addition of abducibles. As also noticed in <ref> [9] </ref>, case-based systems usually adopt a conservative approach trying to re-use as much as possible of the retrieved solution to be adapted; we will then consider the following problem. Definition 5 Diagnosis Adaptation Problem. <p> diagnostic problem DP 1 = hM; HY P; CXT 1 ; hY + 1 ii, a diagnosis H to the problem DP = hM; HY P; CXT; hY + ; Y ii and an integer k jHj, 4 We use the approach proposed for the proof of Theorem 4 in <ref> [9] </ref> as a guideline. Case-based Reasoning 138 L. Portinale and P. Torasso determine whether there exists a diagnosis H 0 to DP 1 containing a sub-assignment of H of cardinality at least k. In order to transform H into H 0 , we have to define an adaptation strategy A. <p> the problem of adapting in a conservative way (i.e. by re-using as much as possible of the retrieved solution) can be as hard as generating the new solution from scratch, even if the retrieved and the current case are very similar; this corresponds to the results obtained for planning in <ref> [9] </ref> 5 . However, experimental results show that we may obtain quite significant improvements with respect to the generation of diagnosis from scratch. <p> Even if theoretical results warn us about the danger of falling into the same degree of intractability of generation, adaptation strategies may have an average complexity better than generation. 5 Results analogous to Theorem 2 and Corollary 1 in <ref> [9] </ref> are still worse, since they show that for a planning problem for which plan generation is polynomial, plan adaptation is NP-complete. 4 Implementing Diagnosis Re-use: the ADAPtER system The aim of this section is to briefly introduce the adaptation strategies we have implemented in ADAPtER (see [10] for more details).

Such a system has an architecture integrating a case-based module with a model-based diagnostic module able to solve a new case from scratch. <p> If an inconsistency is pointed out, that is condition 1 does not hold, then consistency must be re-established by the step of incon sistency removal; this mechanism disproves the explanation leading to the discovered inconsistency, by removing instances of abducibles responsible for such an inconsistency (see <ref> [10] </ref> for more details). The explanation construction mechanism builds abductive explanations for observations to be explicitly accounted for. <p> Opportunistic strategies for supervising the control in ADAPtER are under evaluation: some results in using a function able to predict the adaptation efforts are reported in <ref> [10] </ref>, while the problem of deciding which are the "best" cases to store in the case memory has still to be investigated. Recent results described in [11] show that a right solution to this problem can provide significant benefits. Acknowledgements We thank C.
