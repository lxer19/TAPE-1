Reference-contexts: Furthermore, it eliminates the need for matrix vector multiplications which may be necessary when q 6 1. In this note we restrict our attention to the case when q 1 and refer to <ref> [1] </ref> for the general case. Let p 0 denote dp dt and ff j the PF coefficients. Then: 1 = j=1 1 :(2) Using this representation, the value of expression (1) can be computed by Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1: Evaluate (1) by using the PF representation (2). 1. <p> Example 1. Let h 1 := 1 p with p (t) = Q 40 k=1 (t t k ), where t k are random numbers uniformly distributed in the interval <ref> [1; 1] </ref>, and evaluate it at t = 1:5. <p> Choosing t to bound the coefficients of the IPF provides good accuracy for a small number of factors m, thus preserving reasonable levels of parallelism for systems with moderate numbers of processors. For a full discussion we refer to <ref> [1] </ref>.
