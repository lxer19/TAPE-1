Abstract: This paper is a case study of a machine aided knowledge discovery process within the general area of drug design. A series of experiments is described involving collaboration between the Oxford University Machine Learning Group and the Computational Chemistry department at Pfizer Limited. The aim of the experiments was to test the degree to which Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) techniques can be used to discover pharmacophores. Within drug design, a pharmacophore is a description of the substructure of a ligand (a small molecule) which is responsible for medicinal activity. This medicinal activity is produced by interaction between the ligand and a binding site on a target protein. ILP was chosen by the domain expert (first author) at Pfizer since active molecules are most naturally described, in relational terms, as requiring a substructure (pharmacophore) with various 3-D relations which hold among the atoms involved. The results described in this paper build on previous investigations into prediction of mutagenicity using ILP with a 2-D (bond connectivity only) representation of molecules. Four experiments are described in this paper. The first involved a blindfold trial, in which Pfizer provided 3-D descriptions of 28 active ligands without letting the Oxford group know the pharmacophore involved. In this first trial the ILP system Progol "re-discovered" the accepted pharmacophore for Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibition. The remaining experiments involved multiple conformations of the original ligands. It is typically unclear which of the many conformations of a ligand is responsible for activity. The second and third experiments were false starts through which the background information was debugged. In the final experiment, with the debugged background theory, two pharmcophores were suggested. The first of these accords with the most generally accepted pharmacophore, while the second is an interesting alternative, currently under examination.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper is a case study of a machine-aided knowledge discovery process within the general area of drug design. Our usage of the term knowledge discovery assumes a slightly stronger definition than the following taken from p.6 of <ref> [2] </ref>. Knowledge discovery in databases is the non-trivial process of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns in data. In particular we assume that the knowledge involved is both declarative rather than procedural as well as being necessarily comprehensible and insightful to a domain expert.

Reference-contexts: An advantage of the pharmacophore representation is that it expresses biological activity in a language that is familiar to chemists within the pharmaceutical industry. These representations are also readily convertible into search queries of compound databases, which is an effective means of identifying additional active molecules <ref> [3] </ref>. Because of these advantages, 6 interaction. The pharmacophore contains the key functional interactions (colour coding as in Figure 1) and the geometric relationships between them expressed as distances. we have adopted a data input and output representation that is similar to DISCO.

Reference-contexts: In this view, the remainder of the molecule is useful only as scaffold, holding the pharmacophore groups in the correct spatial positions. Many methods of pharmacophore identification have been described. Examples include the active analogue approach <ref> [11] </ref>. Here it is necessary to identify the equivalent pharmacophore groups in each molecule in advance. Conformations of each of a series of active molecule are then sought which place these groups in a common spatial arrangement. <p> We begin this section with an overview of the experiments. A pharmacophore was proposed for ACE inhibition ten years ago by Mayer et.al. <ref> [11] </ref>. The first experiment described here was a blindfold test to see whether Progol could rediscover the original proposed pharmacophore, given the particular assumptions made by those authors (assumptions regarding the active 3D conformations and zinc-binding geometry, described in the next subsection). <p> The set of 28 pharmacophores can be condensed into a pair of distinct proposed pharmacophores for ACE inhibition. One of these pharmacophores is the same (modulo a small geometric perturbation) as the pharmacophore found in the first experiment, thus confirming the proposal of Mayer et.al. <ref> [11] </ref>. The second is an interesting alternative that deserves further attention. <p> The knowledge engineers were provided with data and relevant chemical information, but they were not told the proposed pharmacophore. This experiment tested the following hypothesis. Hypothesis 1: Given the conformations and zinc binding sites proposed in <ref> [11] </ref>, as well as definitions of hydrogen acceptors and hydrogen donors, Progol will re-discover the pharmacophore proposed in [11]. 3.1.1 The Learning Algorithm The learning algorithm used for this and the other three experiments was the Inductive Logic Programming system Progol [13], which learns first-order definite clause theories, or logic programs. <p> This experiment tested the following hypothesis.

Compounds vary in size from 23 atoms to 78 atoms. The compounds were identified by the names m1, m2, ..., m28. Their activity as ACE inhibitors was asserted to Progol via first-order atomic formulae, or Prolog-style facts, of the form active (m1), active (m2), ..., active (m28).

Reference-contexts: These conformations can be generated by whichever method is appropriate. Output is a pharmacophore expressed in terms of features such as hydrogen bond acceptor, or hydrophobic group and the distance relationships between them. 3 Experimentation This section describes a sequence of four experiments using the ILP system Progol <ref> [13] </ref> (or see http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/groups/machlearn/index.html) to discover a pharma-cophore for ACE-inhibition. ACE (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme) inhibitors are a widely-used form of medication for hypertension. Progol is used in such a way that it returns human-comprehensible pharmacophore descriptions, which also can be visualized. <p> Given the conformations and zinc binding sites proposed in [11], as well as definitions of hydrogen acceptors and hydrogen donors, Progol will re-discover the pharmacophore proposed in [11]. 3.1.1 The Learning Algorithm The learning algorithm used for this and the other three experiments was the Inductive Logic Programming system Progol <ref> [13] </ref>, which learns first-order definite clause theories, or logic programs. 2 Progol takes as input positive examples and (if available) negative examples of a target concept, as well as a background theory, all in Horn clause form. <p> The reader interested in a detailed description is refered to <ref> [13] </ref> or http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/groups/machlearn/index.html. Nevertheless, two further aspects of Progol's operation are important for this paper. Rather than providing a technical discussion of these aspects, we provide a high-level description together with a discussion of their significance for the problem of pharmacophore discovery. <p> For theoretical reasons <ref> [13] </ref>, the bottom clause can be used to direct Progol's search without sacrificing completeness. For the problem of pharmacophore discovery, the bottom clause effectively identifies all the potential pharmacophoric points in the first active molecule, and also records the distance between each pair of these points.

Reference-contexts: Finally we note that this mismatch between compression and pharmacophore search seems likely to extend beyond pharmacophore search to any application domain where textually longer hypotheses are a priori less likely to be consistent with random data, that is, less likely to be true by chance. A related paper <ref> [14] </ref> proposes an alternative function to compression, which is compatible with this situation. <p> This issue is necessarily treated incompletely in the present paper, but receives more attention in <ref> [14] </ref>. Regarding the general application domain of pharmacophore discovery, the obvious "next step" is to apply the approach described in this paper to other pharmacophore discovery problems. There is no shortage of such problems.

Reference-contexts: Progol takes a greedy set cover approach to learning multiple clause theories, but this issue is of no consequence for this paper, because pharmacophore discovery involves learning a single clause only. 3 Progol's search is a refinement graph search <ref> [15] </ref>, but this and most details about Progol are beyond the scope of this paper. The reader interested in a detailed description is refered to [13] or http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/groups/machlearn/index.html.

Reference-contexts: Already these general constructs have proven useful in a variety of other applications of Progol as well as the current one. Full details of the mechanism for expressing declarative bias are beyond the scope of this paper but can be found in <ref> [16] </ref>. 3.2 Methodology Having specified the data and the background knowledge, the methodology for this blindfold trial was nearly as simple as, "(1) Run Progol with the data and background knowledge given, and (2) compare the result with the proposed pharmacophore of Mayer et.al." Only one modification was made to this

Reference-contexts: How does one travel from the lead molecules to the candidate? In some cases, the detailed structure of the target binding site is known, and this knowledge can be used directly in the design of improved molecules <ref> [17] </ref>. However, in the majority of cases, this information is unavailable and design must rely on what can be deduced from the structures of the ligands themselves and their biological activities. The approach, therefore, is to try to elucidate this "structure-activity relationship" (SAR) for the molecules.
