Reference-contexts: In bacteriophage , mutations of the coat protein exist that form functional T = 4 shells [18]. Finally, the T = 7 bacteriophage P2 has a satellite virus P4 that forms T = 4 shells using the P2 coat protein <ref> [8, 1] </ref>. Another well-studied class of icosahedral viruses are the T = 3 plant viruses [15, 17, 31]. All of their structures are similar, and several theories for their assembly have been advanced [28, 32].

Reference-contexts: Another common malformation of virus shells is the formation of open tubes. These can be viewed as planar sheets of hexamers which have been curved until two of their edges meet. This kind of malformation has been observed in many viruses, including SV40 <ref> [2] </ref> and bacteriophages and T4 [16]. The formation of these tubes may require some bonds between two conformations which are not allowed in the local rules.

For example, the T = 1 shell of satellite tobacco necrosis virus <ref> [4] </ref> is typically viewed as an icosahedron, except that instead of having one protein at each vertex, it has a protein at each corner of each triangular face (figure 1b). The same structure can be redrawn by grouping the proteins at each vertex into pentamers, as in figure 1c.

Sometimes assembly is assisted by scaffolding proteins, which assemble with the coat proteins to form a precursor shell, but are removed before the shell matures. At first glance, the assembly of the shells seems easy to understand, because the structure is so regular.

Reference-contexts: It was also generally believed that proteins took on only one conformation, particularly very stable proteins such as those that form virus shells.

Reference-contexts: In icosahedral viruses this has been particularly difficult to explain because very often the same protein occurs in non-symmetric positions [27]. Previous attempts at explaining the formation of closed icosahedral shells from subunits have focused on the icosahedral symmetry, through the Caspar and Klug theory of quasi-equivalence <ref> [7] </ref>. This theory classifies icosahedral shells whose protein subunits all have very similar (quasi-equivalent) neighborhoods and form hexamers and pentamers in the virus shell. The general belief was that shells were formed by assembly of these pentamer and hexamer building blocks. <p> This icosahedral virus shell is made of 20 triangular faces and 60 identical proteins. c) The same icosahedral structure as in (b) but with pentameric clustering.

Reference-contexts: A hypothesis that achieves this, and is consistent with current estimates for the number of scaffolding proteins <ref> [19, 10] </ref>, is that four scaffolding proteins are associated with each hexamer, and five with each pentamer.

Reference-contexts: One of the most notable aspects of virus shells is their highly regular structure: they are generally spherical and possess strong symmetry properties. Almost all human viruses, and many plant and animal viruses, are icosahedral <ref> [11] </ref>. These include the rhinovirus, poliovirus, and herpesvirus, all of which have rounded icosahedral shells. These shells are constructed of repeated protein subunits, or coat proteins, which surround their condensed DNA or RNA genomes.

Reference-contexts: Many of these viral shells are believed to assemble with only limited aid from cellular machinery; they appear to "self-assemble," or spontaneously polymerize and take shape, in the host cell environment. This was originally established for the rod shaped tobacco mosaic virus <ref> [12] </ref> and has since been shown for many spherical viruses [5]. Sometimes assembly is assisted by scaffolding proteins, which assemble with the coat proteins to form a precursor shell, but are removed before the shell matures.

Reference-contexts: Until recently, it has not been possible to directly measure the stability of precursor subunits. However, this has recently 16 been determined for the P22 coat subunit. The assembled capsid lattice is very stable with a T m of 87 ffi C <ref> [14] </ref>. However, the subunit prior to polymerization is only marginally stable, with a broad melting transition with a midpoint at 40 ffi C [M. Galisteo, C. Gordon, J. King, unpublished results].

Reference-contexts: This may also be the reason for the substantial changes that other bacteriophages undergo between their precursor and mature forms <ref> [16] </ref>. Local rule theories can be constructed for all T numbers. There is always a set of local rules with the number of conformations equal to the T number.

These have have five-sided building blocks surrounded by six neighboring building blocks. Little is understood about the assembly of these "non-quasi-equivalent" viruses. <p> Local Rules for a Non-Quasi-Equivalent Virus. The polyomaviruses are simple DNA animal viruses. Their failure to fit into Caspar and Klug's quasi-equivalent framework has been one of the most debated points in structural virology. Based on recent results obtained from x-ray crystallography, Liddington et al. <ref> [21] </ref> postulated that assembly occurs by forming pentamers and that these building blocks are subsequently tied together. In what follows, we apply the local rule theory to a polyomavirus, simian virus 40, to produce a new hypothesis for its assembly. <p> SV40 has been considered an anomaly, because the theory of quasi-equivalence assumes that all icosahedral shells have exactly 12 equally-spaced pentavalent (i.e. have five neighboring capsomeres) pentamers and that all other subunits are packed into hexavalent hexamers. Clearly this assumption does not hold for SV40. Research <ref> [21, 26, 22] </ref> on the structure of SV40 has focused on how pentamers could be hexavalent and on how the same protein could occupy very asymmetric environments. <p> It is true that the rules are somewhat different than those in figure 4, since a protein can have four bonds instead of three. The function of the C-terminal arms has been described as "tying together" the pentameric building blocks <ref> [21] </ref>. While the C-terminal arms clearly do span the spaces between pentamers, they may also play the dual role of enforcing the bond interactions of the local rules. <p> This may apply also to SV40. 14 The double, directed edges could be simplified to either a single, directed or undirected, edge; we have drawn them as double edges so as to correspond to the known biological structure <ref> [21] </ref>. Each inter-pentameric bond interaction is a C-terminal arm of the protein subunit, labeled with a direction to indicate which subunit it is from and a "C" to indicate which arm.

As soon as a subunit has at least one bond interaction, these rules can be applied unambiguously to determine the subunit's remaining neighbors. The different orders in which local rules can be applied give all the possible ways in which the assembly process might proceed. <p> These different conformations need not be maintained in the mature form of the virus. For P22, the differences between the protein conformations in non-equivalent positions are noticeably less in the mature form than in the precursor form <ref> [23] </ref>. Perhaps functionally different protein conformations are required for assembly, while in the mature form all the proteins assume the same functionality and need only be different enough to hold the shell together stably. <p> In the alternate set of T = 7 rules, the hexamers are symmetric under rotations of 180 ffi . This is intriguing because the micrographs of P22 show near-symmetry of the hexamers under 180 ffi rotations <ref> [23] </ref>. It is possible that this alternate set of rules is responsible for determining the assembly of P22, and that the reason seven different conformations of the protein are observed is that functionally equivalent conformations in non-equivalent positions are responding to different 10 capsomeres; dotted lines are bonds between capsomeres.

Previous attempts at explaining the formation of closed icosahedral shells from subunits have focused on the icosahedral symmetry, through the Caspar and Klug theory of quasi-equivalence [7]. <p> It was also generally believed that proteins took on only one conformation, particularly very stable proteins such as those that form virus shells. Recent evidence indicates that virus shell 3 proteins in fact take on several conformations [15, 21, 23], as has been proposed by <ref> [6, 27] </ref>. This important observation informs the approach to virus shell assembly presented below. It is useful to consider what an individual protein "knows," from an information-theoretic point of view. It might appear that each protein needs to know something about the global structure.

It thus seems likely that the local rules are not completely determined by the shell protein of polyoma virus but require aid from some other protein.
