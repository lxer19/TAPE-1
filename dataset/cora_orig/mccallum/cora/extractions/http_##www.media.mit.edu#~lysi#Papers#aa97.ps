Abstract: Amalthaea is an evolving, multiagent ecosystem for personalized filtering, discovery and monitoring of information sites. Amalthaea's primary application domain is the World-Wide-Web and its main purpose is to assist its users in finding interesting information. Two different categories of agents are introduced in the system: filtering agents that model and monitor the interests of the user and discovery agents that model the information sources. A market-like ecosystem where the agents evolve, compete and collaborate is presented: agents that are usefull to the user or other agents reproduce while low-performing agents are destroyed. Results from various experiments with different system configurations and varying ratios of user interests vs agents in the system are presented. Finally issues like fine-tuning the initial parameters of the system and establishing and maintaining equilibria in the ecosystem are discussed.

Reference-contexts: The Pleiades system (Sycara 1995) at CMU introduces task-specific and information-specific agents deployed in different levels that can collaborate with one another to provide the information requested by the user. Another category of WWW agents includes CMU's Webwatcher <ref> (Armstrong et al. 1995) </ref> and MIT Media Laboratory's Letizia (Lieberman 1995). These agents are designed to assist and providing personalization to the user while browsing the WWW by performing a breadth-first search on the links ahead and provide navigation recommendations.

Reference-contexts: These agents are designed to assist and providing personalization to the user while browsing the WWW by performing a breadth-first search on the links ahead and provide navigation recommendations. More similar to our work in terms of application domain and representation is the system build by Bala-banovic and Shoham <ref> (Balabanovic & Shoham 1995) </ref>. They introduced a system for WWW document filtering which also utilized the weighted keyword vector representation. In terms of evolutionary filtering systems, NewT (Sheth & Maes 1993) developed by Sheth, is a multiagent system that uses evolution and relevance feedback for information filtering.

Reference-contexts: At the same time the system continues to explore the search space for better solutions using evolution techniques such as mutation and crossover for refreshing and specializing the agents population. Our approach to creating an ecosystem is influenced by Belkin and Croft's <ref> (Belkin & Croft 1992) </ref> approach to information filtering and information retrieval: filtering and retrieval are in fact two sides of the same coin and should be combined to maximize efficiency in information managing tasks.

Reference-contexts: This technique is inspired by an approach called "Market-Based Control". As Clearwater put it "Market-Based Control is a paradigm for controlling complex systems that otherwise would be very difficult to control, maintain or expand" <ref> (Clearwater 1996) </ref>. Market-based control is a form of control views the system as a minature economy. In other words, it is the ability to yield desirable global behavior in a complex system on the basis of agents acting on only local information.

Reference-contexts: Webcompass is another similar product by Quarterdeck. Webcompass is directed towards off-line search and indexing. It enables the user to generate queries that will search the WWW off-line and presents the results at a later time. The MACRON multiagent system <ref> (Decker & Lesser 1995) </ref> developed at UMass/Amherst, is built on top of the CIG searchbots and uses a centralized planner to generate sub-goals that are pursued by a group of cooperating agents, using KQML (Labrou & Finn 1994), a standardized language for inter-agent communication and negotiation.

Reference-contexts: The results we have obtained show that Amalthaea can learn the user interests and adapt to them over time as they evolve on a set of different user scenarios with different agents configurations. Related Work Metacrawler <ref> (Etzioni 1995) </ref> is an agent that operates at a higher abstraction level by utilizing eight existing WWW index and search engines which was developed at the University of Washington.

Reference-contexts: Etzioni is refering to that as the information food chain and is advocating that Metacrawler is an information carnivore" high up the information food source <ref> (Etzioni 1996) </ref>.

It enables the user to generate queries that will search the WWW off-line and presents the results at a later time.

Reference-contexts: In general, interpreting the terms depends a lot from what field one approaches agents. Document Representation: Keyword Vectoring Amalthaea's internal representation of documents is based on a standard information retrieval technique, weighted vector representation <ref> (Salton & Buckley 1987) </ref>. After their retrieval, the documents are processed by the Weighted Keyword Vector Generator (WKVG) which, as its name implies, transforms the documents into weighted keyword vectors after stemming the keywords. Finally, each keyword is weighted by producing its "tfidf" measure.
