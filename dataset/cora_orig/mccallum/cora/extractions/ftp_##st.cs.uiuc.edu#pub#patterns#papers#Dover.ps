Abstract: Technical Report 1996, Dover Consortium Page 1 / 19 Development of an ObjectOriented Abstract The DOVER project has developed an o bject-oriented framework for the vessel control system domain. The framework is to be used when deve loping new control systems for manoeuvring a ve s-sel. By developing and using the framework a substantial increase of the level of reuse has been obtained. The bulk of the framework is possible to use in most kind of control systems, where you have input data that is to be used for calculating output data. This report describes the problem domain, the project, the framework and the experiences gained from the project. In the framework, we have had great use of and help from the Design Pattern co n-cept [Gamma95]. We describe the patterns that we have used and how we have adapted them to this particular problem. The most important pattern in the design has been the Observer pattern [Gamma95], which has made it possible to have the loose coupling needed for the large scale reuse in this domain. The overall objectives with the DOVER pro j-ect was to study what advantages of introducing development for large scale reuse, i.e. object-oriented framework development. When the design of the framework started, all features from older systems had to be included and it should be poss i-ble to extend them and add new features to the framework. Beside the framework, the following results exist:
