Abstract: In a series of three papers, we investigate the setting up and solving of conditional models within an equation-based modeling environment. Conditional models arise in chemical engineering when modeling systems involve physicochemical discontinuities, such as phase transitions. Zaher (1993) and Grossmann and Turkay (1996) show how one can represent conditional models as an algebraic system of disjunctive equations. In this paper we identify the modeling capabilities needed for an efficient representation of conditional models. We then describe modeling tools for the performance of each of the identified tasks: conditional configuration of a model structure, conditional compilation and conditional execution of procedural statements. We next describe the details of the computer implementation of these tools and show how the expressiveness of an equation-based modeling language increases with their incorporation. Finally we present several chemical engineering examples to demonstrate the scope of application of the proposed extensions. In Part II we investigate how to solve these model using a new complementarity formulation while in Part III we show how to solve using the boundary crossing algorithm of Zaher (1991, 1993, 1995).

Reference-contexts: vary among the clauses of the conditional statement. 3 CONDITIONAL MODELING TOOLS Equation oriented modeling tools support the implementation of unit models and their incorporation in a model library by means of a declarative modeling language, declarative in the sense of explicit and symbolic encapsulating of the knowledge about models <ref> (Marquardt, 1996) </ref>. On the other hand, methods must also be attached to a model definition for the numerical processing of the model equations. <p> Instead, in this CONDITIONAL MODELING TOOLS 7 work we represent that conditional dependence by using an object oriented formalism. In an object oriented approach any real or abstract entity is considered an object and any object can be referenced by a unique identifier <ref> (Marquardt, 1996) </ref>. For instance, in an object oriented mathematical modeling language representing a model superstructure, a simple equation is considered as an object and so is any submodel within the superstructure.
