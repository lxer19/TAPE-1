Reference-contexts: Carlo 3 studies have shown that the precision of a CP asymmetry measurement is degraded by only 10% if the resolution on z, the difference in the B decay points along the beam direction, is about 1/2 the average separation between the decay points, which is 250 m at PEP-II <ref> [3] </ref>. This corresponds to a single vertex resolution of 80 m or better. For tracking in BaBar, the momentum range of interest is p &lt; 5 GeV/c and p T &lt; 2:6 GeV/c.

Reference-contexts: The strip and readout pitch for each layer are given in Table 1. The original plan was to not have floating strips on the -side for layers 1, 2, and 3. Recent studies <ref> [7] </ref> have shown that without floating strips the inner layers are susceptible to significant inefficiencies for tracks with a large incidence angle if the noise is higher than expected.

Reference-contexts: We refer to these units as Detector Fanout Assemblies (DFAs). Each SVT module has a forward and a backward-facing DFA. Each DFA has between 2 and 4 silicon wafers. The flexible fanout circuits <ref> [8] </ref> electrically connect the silicon strips to the front-end electronics (the AToM chips). The z-side fanouts also realize the fi2 and fi3 ganging in layers 4 and 5. The fanouts substrates are 50 m thick and made of Upilex 3 , which is a Kapton-like material.

Reference-contexts: The effect of the new configuration on the hit resolution is quite small. We have recieved from Micron all 340 of the silicon wafers needed to complete the SVT plus additional spares. After recipt from Micron, each wafer is fully characterized as described in Reference <ref> [9] </ref>. The operating voltage, total strip current, and guard-ring current must be reasonably stable and low. For each readout strip, the inter-strip and AC-decoupling capacitance as well as the leakage current and series resistance of the metal layer is measured.

Reference-contexts: The fraction of channels per DFA with any kind of fault is about 2-4%. 5 High Density Interconnects The High Density Interconnects (HDIs), or hybrids, hold the front-end readout electronics (AToM chips) of the SVT <ref> [11] </ref>. The HDIs are responsible for cooling the AToM chips and serve as the mechanical interface for the modules. The HDIs reside in the region between the support cones and the active region of the SVT where space is very limited (see Figure 1) especially in the forward direction.

Reference-contexts: Several have been bonded to detector-fanout assemblies. Production of the HDIs for layers 4 and 5 should be complete by the end of October, 1998. 8 6 The AToM Chip A detailed description of the AToM chip can be found in Reference <ref> [12] </ref>. Here, we will review the basic features and present new test results. Due to the 4.2 ns PEP-II bunch crossing period, the SVT front-end electronics must be able to simultaneously acquire, digitize, and readout. <p> The layer-2 estimated noise values agree well with the measured values in Table 3. giving higher segmentation for smaller amounts of charge. The response isn't as good as we had hoped <ref> [12] </ref>, but it will still be useful for clustering and background rejection. Table 4 lists the AToM-I power consumption per channel. The chip uses 4.6 mW per channel, which can be handled by the cooling system.

Reference-contexts: The after-installation noise vales for the module that was placed 3.3 cm from the beam during PEP-II commissioning were consistent with measurements in the lab. Table 5 gives the estimated average noise for the SVT layers. The estimated average capacitance values <ref> [13] </ref> include the wafer inter-strip capacitance and capacitance to the backside, fanout inter-strip capacitance and capacitance to the backside, and the capacitance from the fanout traces crossing the z-side strips. An average length was used for the z-side fanout traces.

Reference-contexts: Table 4 lists the AToM-I power consumption per channel. The chip uses 4.6 mW per channel, which can be handled by the cooling system. Four AToM chips were tested after a 2.4 MRad dose of radiation from a 60 Co source <ref> [14] </ref>. Three of the 4 chips used the high-gain setting, which will be used in the experiment. One of the three high-gain setting chips was irradiated while under power. The noise and gain were measured before and after irradiation for peaking times of 100, 200, and 400 ns.
