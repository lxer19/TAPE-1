Abstract: In this position paper, we make several observations about the state of the art in automatic word sense disambiguation. Motivated by these observations, we offer several specific proposals to the community regarding improved evaluation criteria, common training and testing resources, and the definition of sense inventories.

Reference-contexts: An example of such a map is given in Table 5. A comparable mapping could readily be extracted semi-automatically from bilingual dictio-naries or from the EuroWordNet effort <ref> (Bloksma et al., 1996) </ref> which provides both semantic hierarchies and interlingual node linkages, currently for the languages Spanish, Italian, Dutch and English. We note that the table follows many lexical resources, such as the original WordNet, in being organized at the top level according to parts of speech.

Reference-contexts: Observation 4. The field has narrowed down approaches, but only a little. In the area of part-of-speech tagging, the noisy channel model dominates (e.g. (Bahl and Mercer, 1976; Jelinek, 1985; Church, 1988)), with transformational rule-based methods <ref> (Brill, 1993) </ref> and grammatico-statistical hybrids (e.g. (Tapanainen and Voutilainen, 1994)) also having a presence.

Reference-contexts: In speech recognition, sense information is potentially most relevant in the form of word equivalence classes for smoothing in language models, but smoothing based on equivalence classes of contexts (e.g. (Bahl et al., 1983; Katz, 1987)) has a far better track record than smoothing based on classes of words (e.g. <ref> (Brown et al., 1992) </ref>). The potential for using word senses in machine translation seems rather more promising.

Reference-contexts: of information (e.g. see (McRoy, 1992; Ng and Lee, 1996; Bruce and Wiebe, 1994)); it seems possible to obtain benefit from sources ranging from local collocational clues (Yarowsky, 1993) to membership in semantically or topically related word classes (Yarowsky, 1992; Resnik, 1993) to consistency of word usages within a discourse <ref> (Gale et al., 1992) </ref>; and disambiguation seems highly lexically sensitive, in effect requiring specialized disambiguators for each poly-semous word. 3 Proposals Proposal 1. A better evaluation criterion.

Reference-contexts: In information retrieval, even perfect word sense information may be of only limited utility, largely owing to the implicit disambiguation that takes place when multiple words within a query match multiple words within a document <ref> (Krovetz and Croft, 1992) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, of the few sense-annotated corpora currently available, virtually all are tagged collections of a single ambiguous word such as line or tank. The only broad-coverage annotation of all the words in a subcorpus is the WordNet semantic concordance <ref> (Miller et al., 1994) </ref>. This represents a very important contribution to the field, providing the first large-scale, balanced data set for the study of the distributional properties of polysemy in English.

In contrast, approaches to WSD attempt to take advantage of many different sources of information (e.g. see (McRoy, 1992; Ng and Lee, 1996; Bruce and Wiebe, 1994)); it seems possible to obtain benefit from sources ranging from local collocational clues <ref> (Yarowsky, 1993) </ref> to membership in semantically or topically related word classes (Yarowsky, 1992; Resnik, 1993) to consistency of word usages within a discourse (Gale et al., 1992); and disambiguation seems highly lexically sensitive, in effect requiring specialized disambiguators for each poly-semous word. 3 Proposals Proposal 1.
