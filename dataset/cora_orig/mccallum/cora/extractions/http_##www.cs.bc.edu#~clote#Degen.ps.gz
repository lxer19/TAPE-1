Reference-contexts: In [18], I. Wegener proved the monotonic analogue of Spira's theorem which relates depth and size of monotonic formulas: a problem P has depth O (d) monotonic formulas if and only if P has size 2 O (d) monotonic circuits (see Boppana-Sipser <ref> [1] </ref> for an overview of boolean circuit complexity). Wegener's result, with the previous theorem, implies the following. Corollary 17 (Karchmer-Wigderson [10]) Monotonic formula size of st-connectivity is fi (n log n ). Another application of the previous theorem, not used in this paper, is the following result.

Reference-contexts: In [13], P. Pudlak has shown the existence of polynomial size constant depth Frege proofs of an appropriate formulation of Ramsey's theorem. It appears unlikely that CP (or CP LE, an extension of cutting planes with limited extension, see <ref> [2] </ref>) can polynomially simulate constant depth Frege systems. <p> Then there is a path from s to t. This notion of st-connectivity, proposed by P. Pudlak, was investigated by S. Buss and P. Clote in <ref> [2] </ref> (this version of st-connectivity for directed graphs was there shown to be equivalent (over constant depth, polynomial size Frege systems) to the onto version of the pigeonhole principle, and polynomial size CP proofs were given for st-connectivity for undirected graphs). An alternate, weaker form of st-connectivity is now defined.

Reference-contexts: Since cutting planes p-simulates resolution, it follows that D m;k j P HP mk has polynomial size cutting planes proofs (more precisely, cutting planes with extension, where the depth of the extension is 2, and all extending inequalities involve polyno-mially (in n) many literals; see <ref> [5] </ref> for information on cutting planes with extension).

Reference-contexts: The size of a CP refutation is the sum over all inequalities P a i x i A occurring in the refutation of P ja i j + jAj, where jAj indicates the length of the binary representation of A. It is easy to see <ref> [6] </ref> that CP is a sound extension of resolution, hence complete. 3 Cutting plane proofs of Degen's principle By E m;k we denote the CP inequalities corresponding to the CN F formula :D m;k .

Reference-contexts: Finally, we prove some fragmentary results concerned with Tseitin's odd-charged graph tautologies, and with a monotonic polynomial calculus for monotonic Gentzen sequent calculus. 2 Preliminaries We refer the reader to Krajicek's book <ref> [11] </ref> for any undefined terminology. Resolution is a sound, complete refutation system for conjunctive normal form (CN F ) formulas sound, in that if CN F formula OE has a resolution refutation, then OE is unsatisfiable, and complete, in that every unsatisfiable CN F formula has a resolution refutation. <p> Corollary 31 There is an exponential lower bound for resolution (even constant depth Frege) refutations of F (G n ). The corollary is immediate, since it is well-known that :P HP onto n has an exponential size lower bound for resolution (and constant depth Frege) refutations. See <ref> [11] </ref> for details. From this construction, one might think that for every unsatisfiable propositional formula H there is a related odd charged graph G, for which H ! F (G) has a polynomial size resolution (or constant depth Frege) derivation. <p> Carbone. In this section, we assume familiarity with Gentzen sequent calculus for propositional formulas, which is here denoted P K for Propositional Kalkul (see <ref> [11] </ref> for a reference).

Reference-contexts: Since no details were given, it is unclear whether Chvatal's intended proof was indeed polynomial size. In <ref> [13] </ref>, P. Pudlak has shown the existence of polynomial size constant depth Frege proofs of an appropriate formulation of Ramsey's theorem. It appears unlikely that CP (or CP LE, an extension of cutting planes with limited extension, see [2]) can polynomially simulate constant depth Frege systems.
