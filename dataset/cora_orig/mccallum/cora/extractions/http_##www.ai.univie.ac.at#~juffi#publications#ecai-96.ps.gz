Title: Digging for Peace: Using Machine Learning Methods for Assessing International Conflict Databases  
Author: Robert Trappl, Johannes F urnkranz, Johann Petrak 
Abstract: In the last decade research in Machine Learning has developed a variety of powerful tools for inductive learning and data analysis. On the other hand, research in International Relations has developed a variety of different conflict databases that are mostly analyzed with classical statistical methods. As these databases are in general of a symbolic nature, they provide an interesting domain for application of Machine Learning algorithms. This paper gives a short overview of available conflict databases and subsequently concentrates on the application of machine learning methods for the analysis and interpretation of the CONFMAN mediation dataset.

It is interesting to compare the results of feature subset selection with the results produced with classical statistical methods <ref> [4] </ref> (see table 4). There is obviously a considerable overlap. Almost all of the variables of table 4 appear in one of the two experiments, most of them in both. The most notable exception is the absence of mediation strategy. <p> Obviously, C4.5's search heuristic based on information gain gives this attribute a high value, because one of its branches (fatalities &gt;= 700; 000) is almost pure. Nevertheless, using only fatalities for generating a decision tree would only yield 62.4% accuracy using the same grouping as in <ref> [4] </ref>. Thus the wrapper algorithm has attributed a higher significance to the previous relation of the mediator which yields 63.3% accuracy. However, the number of fatalities is partially reflected in the intensity of the conflict, which has been recognized as important, although only in one experiment.

An important primary step is to understand the genesis and development of international crises as well as the success or failure of conflict management actions. Artificial Intelligence has lately been recognized as having some potential for supporting social scientists in this area of research [15, 12, 31, 23].

Reference-contexts: Predicting the outcome of conflict management attempts seems to be an easier task than to predict aspects of the outcome of the conflict itself. A reason for this might be that mediation events are more repetitive than the conflicts themselves. <ref> [32] </ref> have developed I 2 D, a variant of ID3 that was specifically developed to deal with the structured nature of the SHERFACS dataset [25]. [16] report a variety of rules that have been created by I 2 D. Again, the only simplification criterion was manual feature subset selection.

Reference-contexts: There exist quite a few databases of either type, nearly all of them created for statistical analysis. Some examples are: the Correlates of War Militarized Interstate Disputes dataset [11], the International Crisis Behavior (ICB) project <ref> [8, 34] </ref>, the COPDAB dataset [1], the event data sets of the KEDS and PANDA projects [24, 33, 7], the Butterworth dataset [9], the KOSIMO database of conflicts [19], the CONFMAN database of mediation attempts [5], and the SHERFACS database [25].
