Abstract: Video servers are important for applications which make use of digital video. The video servers should provide better functionality than most of today's video servers offer, - e.g., support of flexible and instant user interactions, delivery of multiple video formats and support of virtual video documents. In this paper we discuss the requirements that video servers should fulfill and we describe the design and implementation of the Elvira video server. The Elvira video server is built on a cluster of standard UNIX workstations interconnected by an ATM switch. The capacity of the Elvira server is evaluated and we show the effects of different strategies for allocation of video data across nodes and disks.

Reference-contexts: Several strategies for disk allocation has been proposed. The main strategies are either to store the entire video on a single disc, to stripe the video on several disks on a single machine <ref> [1] </ref> or on several disks on multiple machines [2, 8, 19, 30]. The main reason for introducing striping has been to achieve better load balancing on the disks. Disk scheduling and how to optimize the use of the disk bandwidth has been studied intensively [6, 32, 36].

Reference-contexts: We have created the VideoSTAR framework [17] which is a prototype for a video database management system where users and applications can share both media data and meta data. It is based on a generic data model for video information <ref> [15] </ref>. In addition to the video content itself, this model supports composition, structure information, and user annotations. The purpose of the VideoSTAR research has been to make a model to promote sharing and reuse of video data [16], both media data and meta data. <p> Requirements for the Elvira Video Server During the work with the VideoSTAR prototype, we have defined several requirements which a video server for advanced multimedia applications should support. It has been a goal when designing Elvira to fulfill these requirements and support the VideoSTAR data model <ref> [15] </ref>. In addition to efficient storage and delivery of digital video, the following requirements were the foundation for the design of Elvira: * VCR support and frame accurate access The video server should support full VCR functionality including single stepping and variable speed fast forward and fast rewind. <p> Catalog for Elvira To be able to support the requirements presented in the previous section, the video server must have a catalog describing the media data stored in the server. VideoSTAR gives a conceptual data model for video and video information <ref> [15] </ref>. In Elvira, we have extended the parts of this model relevant to the video server with necessary information for storage and delivery of virtual video documents. An Entity-Relation diagram for the catalog is presented in Figure 4.

Reference-contexts: For MPEG-1 [27] it is not as straightforward to support fast forward and fast rewind. We have implemented two different algorithms for doing fast forward and fast rewind <ref> [18] </ref>. The first method do frame skipping. Depending of the requested speedup we send I- and P-frames (skipping the B-frames) or only the I-frames (skipping both P-and B-frames). The second method we have implemented uses separate files for doing fast forward and fast rewind.

Reference-contexts: Implementation of Elvira The first prototype of the Elvira video server was built on a cluster of four Sun workstations running SunOS 4, interconnected by an ATM switch <ref> [20] </ref>. We have tried not to make use of special hardware or software optimizations, to make it easily portable. The video server is implemented in C/C++. Standard TCP/IP and UDP are used for network communication. This makes it easy to port the video server to new platforms.

Reference-contexts: Storing all video on disks will be too expensive.

Reference-contexts: The main reason for introducing striping has been to achieve better load balancing on the disks. Disk scheduling and how to optimize the use of the disk bandwidth has been studied intensively <ref> [6, 32, 36] </ref>. Closely related to disk allocation and disk scheduling is how to utilize the available main memory for buffer. Several strategies and algorithms are proposed like BASIC and DISTANCE [29] and Least/Most Relevant for Presentation (L/MRP) [26].

Reference-contexts: Commercial projects like Time Warner's Orlando project have started to deliver video directly to the homes [28]. The main focus has been on the video storage servers <ref> [13, 31, 33] </ref> and how to optimize these to support as many simultaneous video streams as possible. Different architectures have been proposed for building video servers. Two of the most used architectures for video servers are a cluster of workstations and parallel multiprocessors.
