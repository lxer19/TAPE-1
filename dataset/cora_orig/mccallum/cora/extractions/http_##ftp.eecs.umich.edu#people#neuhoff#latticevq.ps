Abstract: We consider fixed-rate k-dimensional lattice vector quantization of generalized Gaussian sources with decay parameter ff. We find asymptotic expressions for the optimal scaling factor and resulting minimum distortion, as a function of codebook size N . It is shown that the optimal scaling factor a fl = c (ln N ) 2=ff N 2=k . This result indicates that the performance of optimal lattice quantizers diverges from that of asymptotically optimal vector quantization, as N increases.

Reference-contexts: To obtain an asymptotic expression for ~a N , we use a slightly generalized version of the approach developed in <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> In fact, we see that D fl N =ffi fl N ! 1 as N ! 1. When k = 1, our results reduce to those in <ref> [2] </ref>. Thus we have shown that for any dimension, lattice quantizer distortion does not decrease as N 2=k , when the source is generalized Gaussian. As ff ! 1, the GG distribution tends to that of a uniform random variable.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to show that the integer lattice Z n is white and satisfies the centroid condition. It has also been shown that, in any dimension, the tesselating polytope that minimizes normalized moment of inertia is white <ref> [3] </ref> and satisfies the centroid condition. For a given lattice fl, there are several metric quantities of interest. The l ff packing radius is defined by ae (ff) = 2 b2fl It is easily shown that ae (x) ae (y) when x y.

Reference-contexts: For a given source and dimension, we see that choosing fl to minimize n.m.i. minimizes distortion.
