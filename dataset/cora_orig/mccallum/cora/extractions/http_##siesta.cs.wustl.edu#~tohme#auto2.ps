Abstract: Existence Results and Computability fl Abstract Self-awareness can be defined, in a narrow sense, as the capability of a being to realize its place in the contexts in which it interacts with other beings and objects. It has been proved that if ordered preferences are represented by non-concave utility functions, an equilibrium in which agents maximize locally their utilities on their budget sets can be obtained in the case agents are self-aware and self-aware of the self-awareness of the other agents. Such agents are called meta-rational. fl Work supported by the SGCyT of the U.N.S. under the grant ZE10.

Reference-contexts: The idea is to sketch how consumers with partial ordered preferences (non-concave utility functions) can obtain what Smale calls an extended equilibrium, that is, a price system and an associated allocation at which each one maximizes locally his preferences <ref> [1] </ref>. To ensure an equivalence between equilibrium allocation and Pareto optimal allocations consumers should be not only self-aware but aware of their mutual self- awareness. To capture this idea we present a notion of meta-rationality, which, as it will be shown, can be handled by means two level automata.

Reference-contexts: At this point it is easy to state a two-level hierarchy of terms used in the argument above, analogous to the distinction between object language and metalanguage [4].

Back to the main point, the important fact is that a second order equilibrium becomes determined by the interactions between Level 0 and Level 1 . Note that this equilibrium obtains instantaneously, unlike a Rational Expectations equilibrium.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, it can be said that it is a partial recursive function (defined on R). A well known result in Computability Theory is that a partial recursive function is equivalent to a Turing machine <ref> [6] </ref>.
