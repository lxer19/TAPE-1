Reference-contexts: For suitable already G 2 A ! + + AC-qf covers a substantial part of standard analysis (see [8],[9]). In [9] also we introduced new axioms F and F which both (essentially) have the form (4) and are true in the type structure of all strongly majorizable functionals (see <ref> [1] </ref>) but are false in the full set-theoretic model (weaker versions of these axioms were studied already in [7]). Thus, whereas F; F do not contribute to the construction of bounds extracted from a proof, the verification of these bounds so long uses these axioms. <p> 1 -UB, 0 1 -UB (see definitions 2.5,2.12 below) which prove many important analytical theorems in their direct formulation (i.e. without any special representation) which do not have the form (4) by themselves: In this paper we show that 0 1 -UB implies 1) Every pointwise continuous function G : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d !

IR possesses a uniformly continuous inverse function G 1 : [G0; G1] ! [0; 1] together with a modulus of uniform conti nuity. 2 As a consequence of this we obtain the following result: If 8x 0 8y ae sx9z 0 A 0 (x; y; z) is proved <p> continuous function G : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d ! IR converges uniformly on [0; 1] d to G and there exists a modulus of uniform convergence. 4) Every strictly increasing pointwise continuous function G : [0; 1] !

IR, represented by a functional 1 (1) , which is not continuous can be proved only by an instance of arithmetical comprehension over functions CA 1 ar :j 9 0 (1) 8f 1 (f = 0 0 $ A (f )); where A is an arithmetical formula: <p> over functions CA 1 ar :j 9 0 (1) 8f 1 (f = 0 0 $ A (f )); where A is an arithmetical formula: Since we deal with theories which do not contain CA 1 ar it is consistent to assume as an axiom that all functions G : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d ! IR, which are given explicitely by a functional 1 (1) , are uniformly continuous. 2 This is achieved by the axiom F : G 2 A ! + F +AC 1;0 -qf proves: Every function G : [0; 1] d !

This simplifies the formalization of given proofs and thereby the extraction of bounds from these proofs. Moreover the proofs of 1)-4) (which now hold for arbitrary functions G; G n ) become more simple. <p> In [5], [6] this was applied to concrete proofs in best approximation theory yielding new numerical estimates which improved known estimates significantly (see [7] for a discussion of these results). In [5] we also gave a detailed representation of IR, C <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and more general complete separable metric spaces and showed that e.g. the theorem stating the attainment of the maximum value for f 2 C ([0; 1] d ; IR) (for d = 1) as well as some more specific theorems from approximation theory have the logical form (4). <p> From this it follows that these theorems have no functional interpretation in Godel's T. 3 C <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and its generalization to C ([0; 1] d ; IR) and the explicit definition of the basic function (al)s of analysis in the chapters 3 and 5 of [8] we were able to show that these principles can be expressed as axioms (4) in G 2 A ! . <p> The motivation for our axioms F , F was to formulate a more general higher type version of WKL which can be formulated and applied without the need of coding up objects like functions <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! IR. This allows very short proofs for 1)-4) in G 2 A ! + F +AC 1;0 -qf. The relationship between F and WKL is studied in detail in [9].

Furthermore, in section 3 we refer to the representation of IR d and <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d developed in [12]. 2 The axiom F and the principle of uniform boundedness In [9] we introduced the following `non-standard' axiom F which is not valid in the full set-theoretic type structure S ! of all set-theoretic functionals but is true in the type structure of all strongly <p> F and the principle of uniform boundedness In [9] we introduced the following `non-standard' axiom F which is not valid in the full set-theoretic type structure S ! of all set-theoretic functionals but is true in the type structure of all strongly majorizable functionals M ! which was introduced in <ref> [1] </ref> for different purposes (see [9] for details; a special case of F -called F 0 in [9]- was already studied in [7]). In this section we review some of the results on F from [9]. <p> show how 0 1 -UB and 0 1 -UB can be used in analysis: Application 1: Proposition 3.1 For every fixed number d the following holds: 1) G 2 A ! 0 1 -UB (and therefore G 2 A !

Since 1)-4) do not have the logical form (4) one has to consider their proofs. <p> Proof: 1) Formulated in G 2 A ! the assertion above reads as follows: If 1 (1) (note that we do not need the complicated representation of C ([0; 1] d ; IR) from chapter 3) of <ref> [8] </ref> represents a function [0; 1] d !

Reference-contexts: The relationship between F and WKL is studied in detail in [9]. All undefined notions are used in the sense of [9] on which this paper relies. Furthermore, in section 3 we refer to the representation of IR d and [0; 1] d developed in <ref> [12] </ref>. 2 The axiom F and the principle of uniform boundedness In [9] we introduced the following `non-standard' axiom F which is not valid in the full set-theoretic type structure S ! of all set-theoretic functionals but is true in the type structure of all strongly majorizable functionals M ! which <p> By the representation of [0; 1] from <ref> [12] </ref> we can restrict ourselves to representatives x 1 of elements of [0; 1] d which satisfy d i (x) 1 M for i = 1; : : : ; d (where M := n:j (6 (n + 1); 3 (n + 1) 1)). 8x 1 ; x 2 1 d <p> Since real numbers are represented as Cauchy sequences with fixed rate of convergence, IR 2 0 1 and &lt; IR 2 0 1 ; see <ref> [12] </ref> for details. 7 Instead of k k max we can also use e.g. the euclidean metric on IR d thereby obtaining a modulus of continuity w.r.t. this metric.

Reference-contexts: The provably recursive functions of RCA 0 +WKL are just the primitive recursive ones. This was firstly proved by H. Friedman in 1979 (in an unpublished paper) using model-theoretic methods. Later on W.Sieg gave a proof-theoretic treatment of this result using cut-elimination (see <ref> [14] </ref>). In [4] we proved the conservativity of WKL over the finite type theories PRA ! and PA ! even for higher type sentences 8x 1 8y ae sx9z o A 0 (x; y; z), where ae; o are arbitrary types.

Reference-contexts: The proofs of 1) and 2) using WKL (relative to RCA 0 ) require a tedious coding technique. In particular pointwise continuous functions have to be coded as a complicated set of quadruples of rational numbers (see <ref> [15] </ref>). Although working in the more flexible language of finite types makes it much easier to speak about such functions (namely as functionals of type 1 (1)) this does not help as long as one has to use WKL as the basic principle of proof.
