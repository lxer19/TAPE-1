Abstract: Suppose we have observations y i = s i +z i , i = 1; :::; n, where (s i ) is signal and (z i ) is i.i.d. Gaussian white noise. Suppose we have available a library L of orthogonal bases, such as the Wavelet Packet bases or the Cosine Packet bases of Coifman and Meyer. We wish to select, adaptively based on the noisy data (y i ), a basis in which best to recover the signal ("de-noising"). Let M n be the total number of distinct vectors occcuring among all bases in the library and let t n = In short, the basis-adaptive estimator achieves a loss within a logarithmic factor of the ideal risk which would be achievable if one had available an oracle which would supply perfect information about the ideal basis in which to de-noise, and also about which coordinates were large or small. The result extends in obvious ways to more general orthogonal basis libraries, basically to any libraries constructed from an at-most polynomially-growing number of coefficient functionals. Parallel results can be developed for closely related entropies. Key Words. Wavelet Packets, Cosine Packets, weak` p spaces. Adaptive Basis Selec p

Reference-contexts: It is currently popular to use a fixed orthonormal bases such as wavelet bases for noise removal, by the following thresholding scheme: transform into the basis, apply thresholding, return to the original basis <ref> [5, 11, 10] </ref>. It has been shown that the success of such a de-noising scheme is directly tied to the extent to which the orthonormal basis compresses the signal to be recovered [6].

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that the success of such a de-noising scheme is directly tied to the extent to which the orthonormal basis compresses the signal to be recovered <ref> [6] </ref>. Since a given signal may be compressed well in one basis and not in others, one naturally expects that working in a single, fixed basis (Fourier, Wavelet, etc.) will impose limitations on the kind of signals which can be adequately de-noised.

Suppose we have noisy data as in (1). <p> However, the gain in allowing general weights is not large, as the two ideal risks differ by at most a factor 2.) Donoho and Johnstone <ref> [8] </ref> have shown that it is possible to come within a factor 2 log (n) of these ideal risks. Let n = 2 log (n) and define the hard thresholding nonlinearity t (y) = y1 fjyj&gt;tg . <p> Thus selecting a basis worsens the risk upper bound by at most a constant factor, compared to working in an ideal basis. Since (2) has been shown in <ref> [8] </ref> to be in some sense optimal, clearly (3) cannot be significantly strengthened either. 4 Proof by Minimum Complexity Argument Define the Complexity functional K (~s; s) = k~s sk 2 where N L (~s) = min #fi : ~s i [B] 6= 0g is the minimum complexity (non-zeroness) of ~s
