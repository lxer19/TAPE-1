Abstract: With the increasing popularity of portable wireless computers, mechanisms to efficiently transmit information to such clients are of significant interest. The environment under consideration is asymmetric in that the information server has much more bandwidth available, as compared to the clients. In such environments, often it is not possible (or not desirable) for the clients to send explicit requests to the server. It has been proposed that in such systems the server should broadcast the data periodically. One challenge in implementing this solution is to determine the schedule for broadcasting the data, such that the wait encountered by the clients is minimized. A broadcast schedule determines what is broadcast by the server and when. In this report, we present algorithms for determining broadcast schedules that minimize the wait time. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate that our algorithms perform well. Variations of our algorithms for environments subject to errors, and systems where different clients may listen to different number of broadcast channels are also considered. fl Research reported is supported in part by Texas Advanced Technology Program grant 009741-052-C and National Science Foundation grant MIP-9423735. y Appears in part at Workshop on Satellite Based Information Services (WOSBIS), Nov. 1996, Rye, NY. z Typographical errors in Appendix B corrected on November 18, 1996.

Reference-contexts: In the environment under consideration, the downstream communication capacity, from server to clients, is relatively much greater than the upstream communication capacity, from clients to server. Such environments are, hence, called asymmetric communication environments <ref> [2] </ref>. In an asymmetric environment, broadcasting the information is an effective way of making the information available simultaneously to a large number of users. For asymmetric environment, researchers have previously proposed algorithms for designing broadcast schedules [4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 17, 18, 19]. <p> It is important to minimize the access time so as to decrease the idle time at the client.

[3] do not have a way of determining the optimal frequencies for the different disks, whereas, our algorithm automatically tries to use the optimal frequencies. (b) Our algorithm is on-line in that the broadcast schedule is not predetermined. <p> This allows our algorithm to quickly react to any changes in parameters (such as demand probabilities). (c) The algorithm in <ref> [3] </ref> imposes the constraint that the instances of each item be equally spaced at the risk of introducing idle periods (or "holes") in the broadcast schedule (the holes may be filled with other information). <p> Our algorithm also tries to space items at equal spacing, however, it does not enforce the constraint rigidly. Therefore, our algorithm does not create such holes. The argument in favor of a rigid enforcement of equal spacing, as in <ref> [3] </ref>, is that caching algorithms are simplified under such conditions.

The Zipf distribution may be expressed as follows: p i = P M 1 i M where is a parameter named access skew coefficient. Different values of the access skew coefficient yield different Zipf distributions. <p> Thus, our algorithm performs well (close to optimal). Now note that, when number of buckets is 1, Algorithm B reduces to the so called "flat" cyclic scheduling <ref> [3] </ref> scheme where each item is broadcast once in a broadcast cycle. As the number of buckets approaches the number of items M , performance of the bucketing algorithm should approach the performance of algorithm A. <p> Secondly, as simulation results are very close to the analytical lower bounds, analytical bounds can be used as a first-order approximation of actual performance.

Impact of errors on the scheduling policy is also evaluated. In an asymmetric environment, when a client receives an information item containing errors (due to some environmental disturbance), it is not always possible for the client to request retransmission of the information. <p> The first observation stated in Lemma 1 below is intuitive.

In reality, it is not always possible to space instances of an item equally. <p> We assume the ideal situation, as implied by Lemma 1, where instances of all items can be equally spaced. This assumption, although often difficult to implement, does lead to a useful result stated in Theorem 1. This result is a generalization of a result derived in <ref> [4, 18] </ref>. The result in [4, 18] applies only to items of identical size, whereas, our result applies to items of differing sizes.

Reference-contexts: Their solution to this problem is to use error control codes (ECC) for forward error correction, and a RAID-like approach (dubbed airRAID) that stripes the data. The server is required to transmit the stripes on different frequencies, much like the RAID approach spreads stripes of data on different disks <ref> [5] </ref>. ECC is not always sufficient to achieve forward error correction, therefore, uncorrectable errors remains an issue (which is ignored in the past work on data broadcast).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Mobile computing and wireless networks are fast-growing technologies that are making ubiquitous computing a reality. With the increasing popularity of portable wireless computers, mechanisms to efficiently transmit information to such clients are of significant interest <ref> [13] </ref>. For instance, such mechanisms could be used by a satellite or a base station to communicate information of common interest to wireless hosts. In the environment under consideration, the downstream communication capacity, from server to clients, is relatively much greater than the upstream communication capacity, from clients to server. <p> ECC is not always sufficient to achieve forward error correction, therefore, uncorrectable errors remains an issue (which is ignored in the past work on data broadcast). Battlefield Awareness and Data Dissemination (BADD) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) is a project in which our research work may be applied <ref> [13] </ref>. ACTD is managed and funded by DARPA Information System Services.

Reference-contexts: For broadcasts that last a short time, other initial values may perform better. For instance, R (j) may be initialized to l j . It can be shown that, algorithm A produces a cyclic schedule, if the ties in step 2 of the algorithm are resolved deterministically <ref> [15] </ref>. Performance measurements for the above algorithm are presented in Section 6. Our algorithm improves access time by a factor of 2 as compared to the probabilistic on-line algorithms presented in [17, 18]. <p> The clients can then subscribe to as many channels as they want (and can afford). It is apparent that proper use of these channels should result in better performance. Here we give one approach to exploit these channels to improve performance. Other approaches are also possible <ref> [15] </ref>. The approach considered here uses a modification of Algorithm A, described in Section 3.3, to accommodate multiple channels. Let the total number of broadcast channels be c, the channels being numbered 1 through c.

Reference-contexts: Such environments are, hence, called asymmetric communication environments [2]. In an asymmetric environment, broadcasting the information is an effective way of making the information available simultaneously to a large number of users.

Two metrics are used to evaluate these algorithms: * Access time: This is the amount of time a client has to wait for some information that it needs. <p> It is important to minimize the tuning time, because the power consumption of a wireless client is higher when it is listening to the transmissions, as compared to when it is in a doze mode <ref> [9, 10, 11, 17] </ref>. This report presents an approach to minimize the access time. We consider a database that is divided into information items (or items for short). Thus, a broadcast schedule specifies when each item is to be transmitted. <p> The access time achieved by the on-line algorithms is shown to be very close to the theoretical lower bound. Also, performance of our on-line algorithm is significantly better than that proposed previously <ref> [17] </ref>. The rest of the report is organized as follows.

In general, as shown in section 6, the proposed on-line algorithm performs close to the optimal obtained by Equation 3. However, it is also possible to construct scenarios where the schedule produced by the algorithm is not exactly optimal, as demonstrated in the next example. <p> Ammar and Wong [4, 18] have performed extensive research on broadcast scheduling and obtained many interesting results.

Impact of errors on the scheduling policy is also evaluated. In an asymmetric environment, when a client receives an information item containing errors (due to some environmental disturbance), it is not always possible for the client to request retransmission of the information. <p> The first observation stated in Lemma 1 below is intuitive. This observation also follows from a result presented in [12], and has been implicitly used by others (e.g., <ref> [3, 4, 18] </ref>). Lemma 1 The broadcast schedule with minimum overall mean access time results when the instances of each item are equally spaced. Proof of the lemma is omitted here for brevity. In reality, it is not always possible to space instances of an item equally. <p> We assume the ideal situation, as implied by Lemma 1, where instances of all items can be equally spaced. This assumption, although often difficult to implement, does lead to a useful result stated in Theorem 1. This result is a generalization of a result derived in <ref> [4, 18] </ref>. The result in [4, 18] applies only to items of identical size, whereas, our result applies to items of differing sizes. We use this result to design on-line broadcast scheduling algorithms, which have not been investigated previously. <p> This assumption, although often difficult to implement, does lead to a useful result stated in Theorem 1.
