Title: Applying Natural Language Processing Techniques to Speech Prostheses

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to improving speech prostheses for people with severe motor disabilities. Many people who are unable to speak because of physical disability utilize text-to-speech generators as prosthetic devices. However, users of speech prostheses very often have more general loss of motor control and, despite aids such as word prediction, inputting the text is slow and difficult. For typical users, current speech prostheses have output rates which are less than a tenth of the speed of normal speech. We are exploring various techniques which could improve rates, without sacrificing flexibility of content. Here we describe the statistical word prediction techniques used in a communicator developed at CSLI and some experiments on improving prediction performance. We discuss the limitations of prediction on free text, and outline work which is in progress on utilizing constrained NL generation to make more natural interactions possible.

Reference-contexts: This is useful for text which is repeated frequently, but requires memorization and does not allow much flexibility. Some systems use Minspeak <ref> (Baker, 1982) </ref>, which allows short sequences of keystrokes to be used to produce whole utterances. Minspeak is compact and quite flexible, but using it effectively requires considerable learn ing.

Reference-contexts: Prediction systems have been used for at least 20 years (see Newell et al, 1995, and references therein). The basic techniques are actually useful for any sequence of actions: for example, they can be used for computer commands <ref> (e.g. Darragh and Witten, 1992) </ref>. However, we will concentrate on text input here, since it is possible to improve prediction rates by using knowledge of language.

Reference-contexts: We discuss prediction further below. Compansion Compansion is an approach which has been used in a prototype system <ref> (Demasco and Mc-Coy, 1992) </ref> but is not yet available commercially. It allows the user to input only content words, to which morphological information and function words are added by the system to produce a well-formed sentence.

Reference-contexts: Other work by the same group allows the retrieval of preconstructed utterances and stories in appropriate contexts <ref> (Newell et al, 1995) </ref>. A commercial implementation of this work is Talk:About, produced by Don Johnson Incorporated. This approach is important in that it emphasizes the social role of conversation, but it allows the user little flexibility at the time the conversation is taking place. <p> Prediction ordering is based on the user's previous input, and so the system can automatically adapt to the individual user. Unknown strings are added to the database, thus allowing them to be predicted subsequently. Prediction systems have been used for at least 20 years <ref> (see Newell et al, 1995, and references therein) </ref>. The basic techniques are actually useful for any sequence of actions: for example, they can be used for computer commands (e.g. Darragh and Witten, 1992).

Reference-contexts: Furthermore we would expect there to be environments where it is possible to provide scripts for interactions <ref> (e.g. Schank and Abelson, 1977) </ref>, such as restaurants and supermarkets. Constructing detailed scripts for real world situations is not a main focus of our research, since we would expect there to be wide variability in what a particular individual would find useful.
