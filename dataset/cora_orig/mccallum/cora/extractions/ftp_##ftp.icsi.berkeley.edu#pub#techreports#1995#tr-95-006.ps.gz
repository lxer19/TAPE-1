Abstract: In this paper we present a new fast and stable parallel algorithm for computing the Cholesky decomposition of real symmetric and positive definite tridiagonal matrices. This new algorithm is especially suited for the solution of linear systems and for computing a few eigenvalues of very large matrices. We demonstrate these results on the Connection Machine CM5, where we obtain a very satisfactory performance. We finally note that the algorithm can be generalized to block tridiagonal and band systems.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we mention some applications of 1 the algorithm to the implementation of the QR algorithm, and state some open problems. 2. Definitions and Main Notations. We denote by R n the set of real vectors of order n and by e i = <ref> [0; : : :; 0; 1; 0; : : :; 0] </ref> T ; where the 1 is in the ith position, i = 1; : : :; n, the standard basis for this vector space. <p> In Table 1 we compare the typical running times of some computational routines on a DEC Alpha 7000 Model 660 Super Scalar machine. The BLAS routine "dgemm" performs matrix multiplication, the LAPACK routines "dpotrf" and "dpbtrf" <ref> [1] </ref> perform the Cholesky decomposition on dense and tridiagonal matrices respectively, and the private routine "trid" performs the above revised decomposition.

Reference-contexts: More recently, the Cholesky decomposition, or a variation of it, has been used in connection with the accurate computation of the singular values of bidiagonal matrices [12, 15], and of the eigenvalues of specially structured symmetric tridiagonal matrices <ref> [10] </ref>.

Although theoretically we can only say that 0 = ( 1 = N ) ^ (see Barlow and Demmel <ref> [10] </ref> and Demmel and Kahan [12] for some exceptions to this rule), we often do get 0 = O ( ^ ) in practical applications.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we introduce a new algorithm based on a preprocessing stage that subdivides the original problem into independent smaller subproblems that can be solved in parallel. The preprocessing stage makes use of block-cycling and prefix sum computation techniques <ref> [11] </ref>. Our parallel algorithm is computationally efficient, scalable, and can be efficiently vectorized. From a theoretical viewpoint, our algorithm computes the Cholesky factors of an order N symmetric tridiago-nal matrix in time O (n) using p processors, where N = np and n = (log N ).

Reference-contexts: This is mainly due to the presence of very short vectors (cfr <ref> [18] </ref>, p. 156), but also to the fact that, in view of the use of shifts in the LR algorithm, it is not possible to know a priori if the decomposition will succeed, and this makes it necessary to check in (3) if x i &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to see that the third stage of the above algorithm can be efficiently parallelized. In addition, after a few steps, the shifts y s in the first stage can be read off the last diagonal element of the matrix (see Rutishauser and Schwarz <ref> [22] </ref>). It follows that the Cholesky decomposition is the main difficulty in implementing the LR algorithm on a parallel machine. This is a major motivation to focus our attention on the development of an efficient parallel implementation of Cholesky decomposition.

Reference-contexts: Though very general, this bound captures the possible behavior of the error since we can actually exhibit a matrix for which this bound is achieved. More special upper bounds can also be derived, see for example Sun <ref> [25] </ref>. However, since A is a relatively small submatrix of the original matrix, the estimate fl 1 = O (fl n2 ) is likely to be more accurate, and in this case jj = O () so that = will suffice.
