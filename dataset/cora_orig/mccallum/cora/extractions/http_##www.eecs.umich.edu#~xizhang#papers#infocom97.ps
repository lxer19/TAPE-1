Abstract: We propose a flow-control scheme that combines the merits of credit- and rate-based flow-control schemes by applying direct control over both bandwidth and buffer resources. The goal of the proposed scheme is to design an optimal rate-control policy for a given finite buffer capacity that maximizes average throughput and bounds end-to-end delay. By applying higher-order rate control, the proposed scheme not only makes the rate process converge to the neighborhood of link bandwidth, but also confines the queue-length fluctuation to a regime bounded by buffer capacity (thus guaranteeing lossless transmission). Using the fluid approximation method, we model the proposed flow-control scheme and study the system dynamic behavior for ABR (Available Bit Rate) service under the most stressful traffic condition. We derive the expressions for queue build-ups and average throughput in both transient and equilibrium states. The analytical results have shown the proposed scheme to be stable and efficient in that the source rate and bottleneck queue length rapidly converge to the designated operating region. Also, presented are examples showing that the proposed scheme outperforms the other existing schemes.

Reference-contexts: In the following we present some of the numerical results we obtained to evaluate system performance and the more complete and detailed results can be found in <ref> [12] </ref>. Performance Analysis for Pattern I, II, and III: As expected, Figure 4 shows Q max increases monotonically with ff and t . Q max also increases roughly linearly with ff and Q max increases faster for a larger t . <p> Notice that for these two patterns, when Q max &gt; ~, R (t) restarts rate-increase from R c with a smaller increase rate of ffe instead of ff. The detailed descriptions of control patterns and derivations of their corresponding analytical expressions are available in <ref> [12] </ref>. Here we only present some numerical results on the transient-state performance. The network condition remains the same as in Section 5.2. But we use R 0 = 4 and = log 2 1 here.
