Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently, Hemaspaandra et al. [4] have proven that polynomial time bounded nondeterministic Turing machines cannot cull (possibly) exponentially many satisfying assignments for satisfiable formulas to unique assignments unless the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to the second level. Book, Long, and Selman <ref> [1] </ref> defined NPMV (respectively, NPSV) as the class of multivalued (respectively, single-valued) functions that are computable by polynomial time bounded nondeterministic Turing machines.

Reference-contexts: Fenner et al. [3] established a theory for polynomial time computable functions relative to NPSV. So, it is natural to ask whether the same collapse holds for various polynomial time reducibility classes of NPSV. Buhrman, Kadin, and Thierauf <ref> [2] </ref>, on top of Proposition 1, showed that the collapse holds for p 1-T -reducibility. In this paper, we extend it to p ff (log n)-T for any fixed constant ff &lt; 1. More precisely, we prove: Theorem 2 Let ff &lt; 1 be a constant.

Reference-contexts: Hemaspaandra et al.'s result can be rephrased as follows: Proposition 1 If every multivalued function in NPMV has a refinement in NPSV, then PH = p 2 . Fenner et al. <ref> [3] </ref> established a theory for polynomial time computable functions relative to NPSV. So, it is natural to ask whether the same collapse holds for various polynomial time reducibility classes of NPSV. Buhrman, Kadin, and Thierauf [2], on top of Proposition 1, showed that the collapse holds for p 1-T -reducibility. <p> For a function h : N 7! N, NPMV [h] = ff 2 NPMV j for all x; k set-f (x) k h (jxj)g. A multivalued function f is polynomial time reducible <ref> [3] </ref> to a single valued function g if there is a polynomial time oracle Turing machine M that computes a refinement of f with the following access mechanism to 1 g: For a query y, in one step, g (y) magically appears on the query tape if y 2 dom (g)

Reference-contexts: Book, Long, and Selman [1] defined NPMV (respectively, NPSV) as the class of multivalued (respectively, single-valued) functions that are computable by polynomial time bounded nondeterministic Turing machines. We say that a multivalued function f is a refinement of g (see <ref> [5] </ref>) if they have the same domain and the set of values of f at x is a subset of that of g at x.
