Abstract: Many of the lower-level areas in the mammalian visual system are organized retinotopically, that is, as maps which preserve to a certain degree the topography of the retina. A unit that is a part of such a retinotopic map normally responds selectively to stimulation in a well-delimited part of the visual field, referred to as its receptive field (RF). Receptive fields are probably the most prominent and ubiquitous computational mechanism employed by biological information processing systems. This paper surveys some of the possible computational reasons behind the ubiquity of RFs, by discussing examples of RF-based solutions to problems in vision, from spatial acuity, through sensory coding, to object recognition. fl Weizmann Institute CS-TR 95-29, 1995; to appear in Vision, R.

Reference-contexts: The ability of experimenters to bias the perceptual decision of the monkey by electrical stimulation of single MT cells (Salzman et al., 1990) indicates that the activity of an MT cell indeed constitutes a representation of the stimulus motion (for a philosophical perspective on this issue, see <ref> (Albright, 1991) </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The theory is based on Barlow's earlier proposal to consider suspicious coincidences to be the basic type of event to which the cerebral cortex must attune itself <ref> (Barlow, 1985) </ref>. Assuming that a major task of the brain is to form a statistical model of the world, Barlow asked what kind of event would be worth noting and making a record of.

Reference-contexts: Among the more general design goals invoked in this context are spatial resolution (Barlow, 1979b), information-theoretic fidelity of reconstruction (Ruderman, 1994a), preservation of information and its efficient encoding (Linsker, 1990; Atick, 1992), efficient learning <ref> (Barlow, 1990) </ref>, and a variety of approaches based on a hypothesized correspondence between the properties of the code and the statistics of natural images (Barlow, 1959; Ruderman, 1994b). 2.1 Interpolation or channel coding? The considerable spatial extent of even the smallest RFs in the primary visual cortex raises a basic issue <p> The probabilistic line of reasoning suggests that sensory coding is "... the process of preparing a representation of the current sensory scene in a form that enables subsequent learning mechanisms to be versatile and reliable" <ref> (Barlow, 1990) </ref>. Specifically, a representation is useful for learning if it includes records of recurring and co-occurring events. As noted by Barlow, a convenient substrate for such a representation is provided by Selfridge's Pandemonium.

Reference-contexts: Although the difficulty of coming up with independent features and with monitoring the statistics of occurrence of each of them should not be underestimated <ref> (Barlow, 1994) </ref>, this is certainly a worthy goal for any perceptual system, because of the ability it would confer to learn and reason in an informed and principled manner. 2.4 Statistics of natural images The idea of a Probabilistic Pandemonium outlined above serves as a natural introduction to the current attempts

Reference-contexts: What if the operator A is nonlinear? If A is differentiable, one can still try to linearize the problem <ref> (Bertero et al., 1988) </ref>. <p> The solution to this equation can then be refined iteratively, according to the Newton-Kantorovich method <ref> (Bertero et al., 1988) </ref>. Thus, the linearization makes it possible (1) to obtain an approximate solution to the problem in a one-shot computation, and (2) to refine this solution by iterating feedforward and feedback processing steps (Kawato et al., 1993).

Reference-contexts: These ideas also fit nicely with the BCM theory of visual cortical plasticity, according to which vectors of synaptic weights seek to become orthogonal (in the input space) to frequently occurring events, and non-orthogonal to events occurring with low probability <ref> (Bienenstock et al., 1982) </ref>. A generalization of the BCM theory that addresses the problem of extracting statistically significant features from multidimensional data has been formulated in (Intrator and Cooper, 1992).

Reference-contexts: Fourier transform has been put forward as one such candidate framework <ref> (Campbell and Robson, 1968) </ref>. 2.2.1 Gratings The motivation behind the attempts to describe the visual system as a Fourier analyzer lies in the universality of the sinusoidal grating as a basic component of more complex stimuli.

Reference-contexts: Local rank preservation. In one or two dimensions, the rank preservation requirement is satisfied locally by any well-behaved mapping. Specifically, a mapping realized by an analytic function with a non-vanishing Jacobian in a given region is conformal there <ref> (Cohn, 1967) </ref>. Such a function preserves similitude of small triangles; in particular, a scalene triangle formed by a triplet of points will be mapped into a triangle with the same ranking of side lengths (see Figure 6). In higher dimensions, conformality is much more restrictive.

Reference-contexts: This amounts to the Aristotelian idea of representation by resemblance, which happens to have been discredited so thoroughly as to become a rare point of consensus in the philosophy of mind <ref> (Cummins, 1989) </ref>. <p> A precursor of this idea can be found in the works of John Locke (1690), whose theory of representation by covariation (in his words, "conformity" between the world and the representation) remains influential to the present day <ref> (Cummins, 1989) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that a three-layer model of this type can approximate any smooth function to an arbitrary precision <ref> (Cybenko, 1989) </ref>. The universal approximation property, along with the availability of a training algorithm which allows the weights to be learned from examples (Rumelhart et al., 1986), made the multilayer perceptron (MLP) a popular tool in modeling cognition. In modeling perception the use of MLPs appears to be more limited.

Reference-contexts: In mammals, the orientation-selective RFs of the primary visual cortex (Hubel and Wiesel, 1959; Hubel and Wiesel, 1968) were at first hailed as precursors of an alphabet of basic features, used by the subsequent stages of the visual pathway to construct a representation of the perceived shape <ref> (see the discussion in Dodwell, 1978) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: naturally from a regularized solution to vision, when the latter is considered as an inverse problem (Poggio et al., 1985). 7 3.1.2 Similarity within and between object classes Consider now a general formulation of the problem of remapping similarity patterns so that they would suit the needs of object recognition <ref> (Edelman, 1995a) </ref>. Let x (A) 0;1 be any two distinct images of object A (obtained under different illuminations or taken from different viewpoints, or both), and x 0 be an arbitrary image of object B.

Reference-contexts: A different principle, based on the notion of faithful representation of the shape-space distances between objects, can be invoked to guide the development of a categorization module based on function approximation. Interestingly, this principle leads to the concept of a receptive field in the shape space <ref> (Edelman, 1995c) </ref>. 9 This observation has been made originally for objects composed of point-like features localized in 3D (Ullman and Basri, 1991); clearly, it applies also to the more realistic case of surfaces rendered and then transduced by a bank of graded-profile RFs; see section 4. 14 function for a given <p> The reliance on a distributed population response | a chorus of individual-object recognizers <ref> (Edelman, 1995c) </ref> | is of utmost importance in the proposed framework. As noted in (Mumford, 1994), population coding endows the representational space with geometrical structure and permits the definition of distances among representational tokens.

Reference-contexts: Nearly thirty years later, an investigation of the statistics of a small sample of natural images has been described in <ref> (Field, 1987) </ref>. The central finding of Field's study is the 1=f fall-off of the amplitude spectra of the images, which can be interpreted as a sign of self-similarity of the image structure across scales. <p> It should be noted that the proposed code is complete (the total number of RFs is the same as the number of image pixels), and therefore does not reduce redundancy <ref> (Field, 1987, p.2391) </ref>. 5 Thus, it serves as a first step towards the computation of statistically independent features (following Barlow's notion of the goal of sensory coding), and not as its immediate implementation.

Reference-contexts: limited spatial extent of real RFs means that only local Fourier decomposition can be assumed, Fourier theories of visual coding have been virtually superseded by wavelet theories, a newly developed framework for signal expansion that relies on basis functions which are localized and have a number of other useful properties <ref> (Field, 1993) </ref> (see section 2.4).

Reference-contexts: The advantage of the sparse code for supporting learning strategies based on Barlow's notion of suspicious coincidences is clear; additional advantages are discussed in <ref> (Field, 1994) </ref>. 5 The redundancy of a set of images is defined in terms of conditional probabilities of their components.

Reference-contexts: Receptive fields in the visual pathway: basic issues The notion of RF was put forward when the first recordings of cell activity in primitive visual systems showed that cells only respond when the stimulus (usually a small spot of light) is confined to a well-defined region of the visual field <ref> (Hartline, 1938) </ref>. Subsequently, it was found that not all portions of a RF contribute equally to the generation of a response, leading to the definition of a RF profile.

Reference-contexts: The first one, related to the notion of inverse optics, has to do with the contribution of the RFs to inverting the effects of illumination and viewpoint. The second source of improvement falls under the general label of class-based processing <ref> (Lando and Edelman, 1995) </ref>: it turns out that in the presence of inherent (geometric) similarity between objects, their RF-space representations tend to undergo similar transformations when the viewing parameters change (see Figure 3). <p> Recognizing a face from an unfamiliar viewpoint calls for the normalization of its representation in some feature space that preserves face identity, e.g., in the space spanned by properly chosen RFs <ref> (Lando and Edelman, 1995) </ref>. 3.2 Recognition as function approximation We have seen that a pattern of activities of RFs can be made to reflect properties of the viewed object, discounting to a certain extent factors that are irrelevant to recognition.

Reference-contexts: The first problem with the direct application of MLPs to the processing of images is that the topological structure of the input (namely, the neighborhood relationships between the image pixels) is lost in the MLP network, where there is no difference between the various components of the input vector <ref> (LeCun and Bengio, 1995) </ref>. Another problem that arises in the application of MLPs to image-related tasks has to do with the computational complexity of learning. As observed in (LeCun and Bengio, 1995), a network configured for direct processing of images will typically include hundreds of thousands of weights. <p> the image pixels) is lost in the MLP network, where there is no difference between the various components of the input vector <ref> (LeCun and Bengio, 1995) </ref>.

In such a case, the required number of examples makes the problem unmanageable from the standpoint of learning theory (Haussler, 1992). <p> A standard solution for this problem calls for making the weight pattern within each RF the same, resulting in a drastic reduction in the number of independent parameters in the model <ref> (LeCun and Bengio, 1995) </ref>. The action of the network on the image becomes then equivalent to a convolution with a bank of translationally invariant receptive fields.

Reference-contexts: Figure 8). The proponents of the so-called computational view of vision (which should be more properly termed reconstructionist) did not seem to believe in the possibility of implementing any visual function of interest using feature detectors as building blocks (see <ref> (Marr, 1982) </ref>, ch.7). The main objection leveled by Marr (op. cit., p.341) was that "the world is just too complex to yield to the types of analysis suggested by the feature detector idea." This objection, however, is being proved unfounded in more and more areas of visual perception. <p> Because of these problems, the standard approach to the understanding of the human performance in shape categorization has been to postulate the recovery of stimulus geometry prior to any processing | including recognition <ref> (Marr, 1982) </ref>. However, just as reconstruction has proved unnecessary in spatial discrimination and in recognition, it seems that categorization as well can be carried out without first building a representational replica of the visual world.

Reference-contexts: The reliance on a distributed population response | a chorus of individual-object recognizers (Edelman, 1995c) | is of utmost importance in the proposed framework. As noted in <ref> (Mumford, 1994) </ref>, population coding endows the representational space with geometrical structure and permits the definition of distances among representational tokens. If these distances reflect appropriate objective contrasts between distal objects, the notion of representation acquires a concrete mathematical meaning.

Reference-contexts: direct optics being the process of image formation). 3.1.1 Inverse optics: RFs and regularization Inverse problems, including those arising in the measurement of visual similarity, are frequently ill-posed, that is, they may have no solution, or the solution may not be unique, or may not depend smoothly on the data <ref> (Poggio et al., 1985) </ref>. A well-known method for approaching such problems is regularization. Consider the equation y = Az (2) where A is the direct operator (assume for the moment that A is linear). <p> Because the feedforward computation step corresponds to a convolution of the data with appropriately shaped RFs, the simple linear concept of RF as a spatial weighting function can be seen to stem naturally from a regularized solution to vision, when the latter is considered as an inverse problem <ref> (Poggio et al., 1985) </ref>. 7 3.1.2 Similarity within and between object classes Consider now a general formulation of the problem of remapping similarity patterns so that they would suit the needs of object recognition (Edelman, 1995a).

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, we would like the representation to capture the similarity relationships within and between natural kinds <ref> (Quine, 1969) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that a three-layer model of this type can approximate any smooth function to an arbitrary precision (Cybenko, 1989). The universal approximation property, along with the availability of a training algorithm which allows the weights to be learned from examples <ref> (Rumelhart et al., 1986) </ref>, made the multilayer perceptron (MLP) a popular tool in modeling cognition. In modeling perception the use of MLPs appears to be more limited. As in cognition, replication of human performance in perceptual tasks requires a judicious choice of the input and output representations.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, the hyperacuity-level performance of subjects in psychophysical tasks involving spatial discrimination (Westheimer, 1981) has been matched by the performance of cortical neurons (Shapley and Victor, 1986; Parker and Hawken, 1987). This has been accompanied by a better mathematical understanding of the phenomenon of hyperresolution in channel-based systems <ref> (Snippe and Koenderink, 1992) </ref>, and by advances in computational modeling of hyperacuity (Wilson, 1986; Poggio et al., 1992; Weiss et al., 1993), as outlined in section 2.1. 1.1.3 Function The third and most important debatable issue is centered around the question of how, exactly, do the RFs support the high-level visual <p> A mathematical understanding for this finding has been provided by a recent work <ref> (Snippe and Koenderink, 1992) </ref> which analyzed the capabilities of population coding of spatial signals (as contrasted with coding by activities of single units).

Reference-contexts: is used in section 4 to construct a categorization mechanism for novel objects. 4.1 Similarity to prototypes Note that, according to the reconstructionist approach, there should be an isomorphism between the representation and the entity it stands for: "representation of something is an image, model, or reproduction of that thing" <ref> (Suppes et al., 1994) </ref>. This amounts to the Aristotelian idea of representation by resemblance, which happens to have been discredited so thoroughly as to become a rare point of consensus in the philosophy of mind (Cummins, 1989).

Reference-contexts: A recent survey of the possible computational roles of lateral connections in the cortex can be found in (Sirosh et al., 1995). As to the role of feedback, whereas the evidence for the involvement of feedback (top-down) processes in vision is compelling <ref> (for a review, see, e.g., Ullman, 1995) </ref>, it is equally clear that feedforward (bottom-up) processing plays a central role in rapid formation of extremely complex percepts (which, of course, may be modified subsequently by top-down influences).

Reference-contexts: Interestingly, this principle leads to the concept of a receptive field in the shape space (Edelman, 1995c). 9 This observation has been made originally for objects composed of point-like features localized in 3D <ref> (Ullman and Basri, 1991) </ref>; clearly, it applies also to the more realistic case of surfaces rendered and then transduced by a bank of graded-profile RFs; see section 4. 14 function for a given object from a collection of its views (see section 3).

Reference-contexts: Under such a mapping, the ranks of distances between points are preserved approximately, on a small scale <ref> (Vaisala 1992, p.124) </ref>. How relevant is local approximate preservation of distance ranks, offered by a quasiconformal distal-to-proximal mapping M , to the representation of real-world shapes? A part of the answer to this question emerges from a consideration of the hierarchical structure of perceived categories.

Reference-contexts: The past decade has seen considerable progress in the clarification of this issue. Specifically, the hyperacuity-level performance of subjects in psychophysical tasks involving spatial discrimination <ref> (Westheimer, 1981) </ref> has been matched by the performance of cortical neurons (Shapley and Victor, 1986; Parker and Hawken, 1987).

Reference-contexts: Although many issues concerning computation with RFs remain unresolved, the present partial survey of their computational role in vision suggests that the unreasonable effectiveness of living perceptual systems <ref> (paraphrasing E. Wigner, 1960) </ref> stems from a peculiar match between statistical and parametric characterizations of visual objects, and properties of visual receptive fields.

Reference-contexts: That very assumption is, however, debatable (Edelman, 1994). In particular, it appears that reconstruction (i.e., interpolation of the stimulus at the highest possible resolution) is not necessary to explain the hyperacuity-level performance of biological visual systems; simple comparison of vectors of activities of RFs may suffice <ref> (Wilson, 1986) </ref>. A mathematical understanding for this finding has been provided by a recent work (Snippe and Koenderink, 1992) which analyzed the capabilities of population coding of spatial signals (as contrasted with coding by activities of single units).
