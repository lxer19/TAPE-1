Title: Motion Planning for Serpentine Robots  
Author: Wade Henningy, Frank Hickmany, Howie Chosety 
Abstract: Serpentine robots offer advantages over traditional mobile robots and robot arms because they provide enhanced flexibility and reachability, especially in convoluted environments. These robots are well suited to inspect large space-fairing truss structures such as the future space station and can also be used to inspect the Space Shuttle cargo bay before launch. Serpentine mechanisms offer unique capabilities on Earth to applications such as search and rescue, surface coating, and minimally invasive surgery. The work, described in this paper, will exploit a geometric structure, termed a roadmap, to guide the motions of a serpentine robot in highly convoluted spaces. This approach offers advantages over previous work with serpentine robots because it provides a general mathematical structure that is not mechanism specific, thereby having applications to a large class of problems.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We present some preliminary experimental results in the area of global sensor based planning for hyper-redundant robot manipulators. Recall from <ref> [5] </ref> that a hyper-redundant mechanism is a kinematically redundant manipulator in which the degree of redundancy is very large or infinite. Such robots are analogous in morphology to tentacles or snakes. <p> Hirose Active Chord by environments which are difficult to precisely model, and thus global sensor based planning schemes are vital to the realistic deployment of hyper-redundant robots in these applications. In this paper, we describe a global sensor based planning heuristic which combines the hyper-redundant kinematic analysis found in <ref> [5] </ref>, [7], [6], [8] and [2] with the provably correct sensor based exploratory algorithms found in [11], [12] and [13]. <p> This work draws from two sub-fields in motion planning: sensor based planning for robots and motion planning for hyper-redundant manipulators, both of which are briefly reviewed in this section. 3.1 Hyper-redundant Manipulator: Inverse Kinematics Recall from <ref> [5] </ref> that we assume (regardless of mechanical implementation) that the important macroscopic features of a hyper-redundant robot can be captured by a backbone curve. A backbone curve parametrization and its associated set of reference frames are collectively called the backbone reference set. <p> A backbone curve parametrization and its associated set of reference frames are collectively called the backbone reference set. In this paradigm, inverse kinematics and task planning reduces to the determination of the proper time varying behavior of the backbone reference set <ref> [5] </ref>. By this approach, global sen-sor based planning is the determination of the family of backbone curves which describe a hyper-redundant manipulator's path through an unknown environment. In [8], many techniques are introduced for parametrizing the backbone curve.

Both the prediction step and correction routine can be done in a sensor based manner <ref> [13] </ref>. Edge tracing continues until one of two conditions are met: (1) the robot encounters a Generalized Voronoi Vertex, or (2) the robot hits a boundary point. A Generalized Voronoi Vertex is sometimes called a meet point because that is where three GVG edges meet.

Reference-contexts: In this method, the entire manipulator is fit within a tunnel and then part of the tunnel is continuously adapted away from any object that becomes unacceptably close. One of the first global sensor based planning techniques for highly redundant robots is based on a tactrix <ref> [17] </ref>. This approach, however, assumes that there are perfect sensors on the robot and has not been implemented on a real robot. Finally, none of the aforementioned procedures can be used for mapping an environment with a robot snake.

Reference-contexts: Based on information gathered from sensors, global sensor based planning incrementally defines most of the robot's path and constructs a model of the robot's environment. This differs from local sensor based planning <ref> [18] </ref> which modifies the robot's plan over a span which is short in time or distance, without affecting a world model. <p> There has been little work devoted explicitly to serpentine motion planning. One approach is based on the defenition of tunnels through an obstacle field, into which the manipulator "slithers" [3], [2]. Recently, a local sensor based planning method was reported in <ref> [18] </ref> in which the snake robot maintains its end effector location while it locally adapts to a time varying environment. In this method, the entire manipulator is fit within a tunnel and then part of the tunnel is continuously adapted away from any object that becomes unacceptably close. <p> This leads to the possibility of the coarse discrete approximation cutting corners. This requires a means to detect obstacle collisions in the discrete approximation and a process for deforming the initial backbone away from the problem area, similar to the method reported in <ref> [18] </ref>. A proper solution to the joint limits problem involves the global optimization of the backbone curve with an upper limit on the backbone's curvature. This method is considered superior to the problem of local joint limit handling.
