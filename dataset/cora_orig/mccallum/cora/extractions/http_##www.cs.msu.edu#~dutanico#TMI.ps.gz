Reference-contexts: In the brain images, the parameters were: scaling in the range [0.9, 1.1], step 0.1; rotation [-8 o , 8 o ], step 4 o ; and translation <ref> [-4, 4] </ref> pixels, step 1 pixel in both x, y directions. Each hypothesis represents a rigid transform of the average shape, and all generated hypotheses are sequentially evaluated using the model fitting function and the best fit is determined (Figs.7a and 12c).

Reference-contexts: The following 10 neuroanatomic structures were identified in individual MR image slices (Fig. 11): left/right ventricles, left/right caudate nucleus, left/right putamen, left/right globus pallidus, left/right thalamus. The brain image data, independent standard, and quantitative validation indices were identical to those used in our previous study <ref> [12] </ref>. Fig. 11. Neuroanatomic structures of interest. A. <p> Area measurements using computer-detected neuroanatomic structure borders correlated well with those derived from observer-defined tracings. Compared to our previously-reported brain image segmentation and interpretation approach <ref> [12] </ref>, our new method described here offers comparable performance while the interpretation process speed increased sixty-fold.

Reference-contexts: The statistical shape literature mostly deals with theoretical considerations while the practical side of the problem is frequently left aside. Several iterative algorithms for aligning a set of shapes exist in the medical vision literature <ref> [21, 27, 28] </ref>. However, the papers do not state how well they approximate the closed-form solution. Therefore, our approach is not iterative and is based on deriving a linear system of equations for computing the least squares fit to a set of shape instances. <p> Moreover, most of the time the square distance from S 0 that minimizes Eq. 4 to the set of shape instances from which it is derived is smaller than that produced by the iterative algorithms actually employed in the literature <ref> [21, 28, 29] </ref>. Now, S 0 is sought such that its coordinates minimize f . <p> Thus, a set of m shape examples produces a cluster of m points in this space. The Point Distribution Model (PDM) describes the coordinates variation within the clusters assuming linear dependence. The theoretical assumptions initially stated by Cootes and Taylor are <ref> [21] </ref>: 1. The cluster points lie within an Allowable Shape Domain (ASD) which is approximately ellipsoidal. 2. The training examples give an indication of size of the ASD. 3. The cluster center is specified by the points of the least squares fit instance shape ( x ). 4. <p> Cootes and Taylor propose to derive limits for b k by examining the distributions of the parameter values required to generate the training set <ref> [21] </ref>. They recommend that b k 's be chosen such that 3 k b k 3 k (10) since most of the population lies within three standard deviations of the mean. D. Limitations of PDMs While the PDM's have many favorable properties, they are not free of several limitations. <p> We also used implicit knowledge about object context representing inter-relationships of several objects. Gray-level appearance g j = (g j;1 ; :::; g j;n p ) is calculated in neighborhoods around each of the shape model points j <ref> [21] </ref>. It is determined for every shape model point j of each training image along a profile P P 0 of a constant length n p , centered at the point j and perpendicular to the shape boundary (Fig. 6a).

Reference-contexts: 1. The quantity 2 is well defined for every two shape instances A and B; 2. 2 is not symmetric, that is, 2 (A; B) 6= 2 (B; A) <ref> [22, 23] </ref>, but if A and B have roughly the same scale then 2 (A; B) 2 (B; A); 3. since 2 (A; B) = 2 (A; C) for every C 2 shape (B), it can be considered the distance between the fixed shape instance A and the shape class of <p> B. Shape Averaging There is a large number of papers dealing with averaging/aligning shapes into a common coordinate frame. While the most popular approach in the statistical/medical vision communities is the Procrustes Analysis [24-26], the work of Horn <ref> [22, 23] </ref> is better known to non-medical vision researchers. Both frameworks provide analytic solutions to the shape alignment problem as well as approximate solution algorithms. The statistical shape literature mostly deals with theoretical considerations while the practical side of the problem is frequently left aside.

Reference-contexts: This may happen if a subshape fitted by the previous step exhibits weak edges (Fig.8a) or if there exists another border of similar properties in the neighborhood. In the existing literature dealing with point distribution models, the only study we are aware of to approach the outlier problem is <ref> [31] </ref>. A combination search-based solution was proposed that was based on a somewhat restricted assumption that the true position of a model point lies along the perpendicular profile through the current point position and constitutes a local peak that can be located by the gray-level model for that point.

Reference-contexts: III. PDM Approach to MR Brain Image Interpretation In many areas of image segmentation and interpretation, reliable a priori knowledge is available to help guide the image analysis process. For instance, in brain imaging, the image data are routinely represented in a normalized Talairach space <ref> [32] </ref>. Consequently, approximate positions of individual neuroanatomic structures can be determined. Knowledge about their sizes, shapes, gray level appearance, etc. can be acquired from a training set of examples. A. <p> The images were acquired from 27 subjects and normalized using a three-dimensional proportional Talairach grid system <ref> [32] </ref>. Normalization using the Talairach grids while not perfect increased the likelihood that slice n in each data set represented the same anatomic slice of the brain. Each image from the set contained the brain structures to be identified, as shown in Fig. 11. B.

Reference-contexts: Every two consecutive model points that lie on the object boundary define a border segment. To compute its strength, a local filtering is applied to each clique on that border segment. The designed filter was inspired by that of Geman and Jedynak <ref> [33] </ref>. If two pixels are located in close proximity and both belong to the same object, they are expected to have a smaller intensity difference than if one of them belongs to a different object or background (Fig. 6b). The filter is based on a pair of close parallel profiles.

Reference-contexts: In the past, several sophisticated fitness functions were proposed that were based on combining the Mahalanobis distance of the current shape hypothesis to the average shape with the Mahalanobis distance of the corresponding image profiles to the average (model) profiles <ref> [34] </ref> and even including a background model in a Bayesian framework [35]. These objective functions however lack a way of assessing the object properties between the model points.

Clearly, if two consecutive model points lie on a boundary, this information together with the boundary strength may be used in the detection procedure.
