Title: Extending NC and RNC Algorithms  
Author: Nimrod Megiddo 
Abstract: A technique is presented by which NC and RNC algorithms for some problems can be extended into NC and RNC algorithms, respectively, that solve more general parametric problems. The technique is demonstrated on explicit bounded degree circuits. Applications include parametric extensions of the shortest path and spanning tree problems and, in particular, the minimum ratio cycle problem, showing all these problems are in NC.

Introduction A parametric technique presented in [ 1; 2 ] has been applied in the design of many serial algorithms. It was shown in <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> that sometimes a good parallel algorithm for one problem helps via this technique in the design of a serial algorithm for another problem. <p> This extension unifies many optimization problems (see <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> and the references thereof). 3. Extensions of NC algorithms In this section we explain the extension operation. Consider an arithmetic circuit C with a certain parameterizable set S of inputs. <p> Usually, a more efficient extended circuit can be constructed. Obviously, it is not necessary that each gate will have its own copy of the original circuit. As argued in <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> , it can also be shown here that critical values produced by different gates can be tested in a binary search fashion. This would reduce the size of the circuit at the expense of increasing its depth (which remains poly-log though). The idea is as follows. <p> Thus we have Corollary 3.3. The minimum ratio cycle problem is in NC. Other applications are parametric versions of spanning tree problems, certain problems of computational geometry, linear programming in bounded dimension, and specializations of hard combinatorial optimization problems to trees (see the references of <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> for more detail). 4.
