Abstract: Digital video has become increasingly common on the desktop. However, custom video decoding hardware is not widely used. Instead, most users rely on software decoders. In this paper we examine the decoding pipeline for compression schemes based on the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). In particular, we investigate the interaction of a software JPEG decoder with modern memory hierarchies and superscalar CPUs. We present several optimizations that we expect will be effective for new systems given current trends in architecture.

Reference-contexts: Both are direct mapped with 32 byte blocks, and the data cache is write through. Off chip there is a 256 kilobyte unified second level cache. It is organized into 32 byte blocks, and is direct mapped and write back. We used the atom <ref> [ato96] </ref> tool from DEC to gather statistics about the execution behavior of the JPEG decoder on the Alphas. C language procedure calls can be added before and after instructions, basic blocks, procedures, and objects in a binary program.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the two on chip caches, it also has an external 512 kilobyte direct mapped, write back unified cache with 64 byte blocks. To do cache simulations on the Ultra Sparc, we used the utility Shade <ref> [CK94] </ref>. Shade simulates the full Sparc V8 and V9 (Ultra) instruction sets and allows arbitrary code to be associated with every simulated instruction.

Reference-contexts: The IDCT is inherently a floating point operation. Many decoders use integer operations to simulate fixed point arithmetic for speed. The integer IDCT implementation in the Independent JPEG Group's JPEG decoder <ref> [ijg96] </ref> (on which the inverse DCT in CMT is based) treats a 32 bit value as a 19 bit value with a 13 bit fraction. Of course, floating point operations are more precise so an integer implementation of the IDCT introduces greater error than a floating point implementation.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we have considered the influences of memory hierarchies and superscalar architectures on a single decoder. There are other architectural influences that could be examined. Sun [Sun] and Intel <ref> [Int] </ref> have both designed special instructions to speed up video decoders as well as other graphics operations although they took different approaches. One could study these different approaches and the effects of an in 16 struction set architecture on a software decoder.

Reference-contexts: In JPEG, blocks are grouped into units called Minimum The IDCT and dither instructions are interleaved in an attempt to keep all the functional units busy. This technique is known as software pipelining <ref> [Lam88] </ref>. It is easy to pipeline the IDCT and dither since both are linear they consist of loops that iterate over the coefficients of a block. To produce the interleaved version we unrolled the loops and Coding Units (MCUs).

Reference-contexts: The second value then indicates the number of bits that should be read from the stream and interpreted as the next non-zero valued coefficient. The next Huffman code is then read from the bitstream, and the process continues <ref> [PM93] </ref>. Our decoder included a bitstream abstraction in which a pointer to some block of memory was maintained and simple routines could retrieve some number of bits starting at the current location or move the pointer ahead some number of bits.

Reference-contexts: On newer workstations, it is possible to decode television resolution (720 by 480 pixels) video in software at 30 frames per second <ref> [Sun] </ref>. However, as High-Definition TV (HDTV), at 1920 by 1080 pixels, is deployed, desktop digital video is not likely to succeed unless it is competitive with HDTV. Furthermore, experience has shown that there is a long tail to the technology improvement curve. <p> In this paper, we have considered the influences of memory hierarchies and superscalar architectures on a single decoder.
