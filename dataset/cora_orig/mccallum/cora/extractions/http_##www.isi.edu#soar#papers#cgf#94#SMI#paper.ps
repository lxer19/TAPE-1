Abstract: In order to explore the domain of air-to-air combat with Soar, a unified theory of cognition used to model human behavior, it was necessary to interface Soar to vehicles which use the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) protocol. Rather than create what would be in essence a simulator of fighter aircraft, the ModSAF simulation system was chosen to simulate fighter aircraft and provide a DIS interface. To link Soar and ModSAF, we have developed the Soar/ModSAF Interface (SMI). The SMI provides a simulated cockpit for Soar pilots. To guide others in the development of interfaces for other intelligent systems, this paper describes the SMI along with associated design constraints. Implementation details concerning functionality, modularity, and efficiency are addressed. We also identify issues arising from integration difficulties.

Reference-contexts: Given these concerns, the natural testbed for such development is a simulator. This simulator should provide a rich, high-fidelity world so that modeling of pilot behavior is not perverted by simulation artifacts. Fortunately, the Mod-SAF system <ref> [ModSAF] </ref> provides a rich simulation environment it is designed to simulate vehicles in cooperation with conventional live force exercises. ModSAF provides a platform for research into the control of all kinds of computer generated forces. In essence, ModSAF simulates the operation of DIS compatible vehicles.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Computer modeling of intelligent agent behavior is a concern to many researchers in the fields of cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and psychology. The Soar community is particularly interested in developing a model which encompasses a unified theory of cognition <ref> [Soar] </ref>. To this end, Soar researchers are interested in modeling agents that operate in challenging environments [TacAir]. Dynamic environments which require the application of a fair amount of domain knowledge offer a diverse set of problems that must be addressed in developing agents which simulate intelligent behavior.

Reference-contexts: When an agent is created, a user interface is created for that agent, whether it be a new X window or a new I/O stream interleaved onto standard input/output (used by the Soar Development Environment (SDE) <ref> [SDE] </ref>). This is no problem when one ModSAF is running on a local host. However, if more than one ModSAF is running and ModSAF's load balancing is active, then locally created agents will be simulated on remote hosts and their user interface will appear remotely.
