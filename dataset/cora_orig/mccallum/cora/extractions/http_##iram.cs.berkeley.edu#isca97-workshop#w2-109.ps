Abstract: There are strong demands for high speed and low power to realize systems on silicon. However, the current circuit design technologies for MPU and DRAM are based on their own optimized process technologies. It is necessary modify the circuit design technology for embedded memory logic after reviewing process technologies of MPU and DRAM. In this paper, we propose the modified design concept for IRAM for multimedia applications. After scrutinizing an example of multimedia applications, we propose a new IRAM architecture for multimedia applications. We are currently designing IRAM system which executes DCT of MP@ML in MPEG2 at 72.6MHz with 0.35m CMOS EML (Embedded Memory and Logic) process with 4-metal layers. Also, we propose that the DRAM block should be divided as many blocks as possible to prevent DRAM block from being the bottleneck of the system performance. In addition, we propose that by using the new EML process technology, the DRAM circuits must be modified to use wide address buses and data buses.

Reference-contexts: The improvements of fabrication technology enables the increase of DRAM density by Moore's law. Also, the design technique improves the speed of DRAM and generate new kinds of DRAM type for high performance applications as shown in Figure 2 <ref> [1] </ref>. However, the improvements of MPU (or DSP) performance require the large storage area of data with high speed in proportion to the size of software or data. Thus, there are some gaps between MPU and DRAM as listed below. * Operation frequency.

Reference-contexts: To sustain high speed, the supply voltage must be kept as high as possible. There exists an contradiction between speed and dynamic power dissipation. 2 Motivation Generally, SRAM has been used for the embedded memory system because of the convenience <ref> [2] </ref>. For example, high speed SRAM has been used as cache memory because of the performance in the general purpose microprocessors. However, the density of SRAM is much lower than DRAM.
