Abstract: Multimedia technology is widely regarded as a key component of future computer systems. Multimedia technology refers to the integrated processing and dissemination of multiple time-dependent and time-independent media such as data, graphics, drawings, voice, audio, and video. Different from other technologies which employ multiple streams of different media, e.g., television, multimedia technology provides an interactive use of the media streams. We survey the current and emerging network standards for multimedia systems. We survey available multimedia products for use in transitioning to multimedia multimedia technology and evaluate how multimedia can be used within this context.

Reference-contexts: Using digital technology, video-conferences can be moved to a desktop computing system, thus allowing video-conferences to be held from a person's office. In this section we review several distributed multimedia applications, including video-conference systems <ref> [4] </ref>. We consider both freely available and commercial products. The ordering of items does not indicate any preference by the author. 2.5.1 Selected Video-Conferencing Systems * DECSpin DECSpin (DEC Sound Picture Information Network) is a desktop, live audio and video conferencing application for two to six members.

Reference-contexts: The requirements for hardware and software components of a multimedia information system differ significantly dependent on the environment in which a multimedia system is used. A multimedia environment may be implemented at various scales ranging from a desktop to a world-wide environment. In accordance with the Interactive Multimedia Association <ref> [5] </ref> we will distinguish two multimedia environments, a standalone multimedia environment and a distributed multimedia environment, respectively. A standalone multimedia environment is characterized by a local desktop environment.

Since compression algorithms and compression hardware are key components of any multimedia computer system which includes motion video we will devote a separate section to image and motion video compression (Section 3.4). Here, we will only discuss formats for digital video without considering compression aspects.

Reference-contexts: Three compression schemes are offered, for photos, animation and video. * CD-I,CDTV Compact Disc-Interactive (CD-I) is an interactive digital multimedia technology developed for the consumer market. A proprietary standard for CD-I was developed by by Philips International <ref> [16] </ref> in 1988. A CD-I unit consists of a compact disk player, a microprocessor, audio and video decoders and an infrared pointing device. The CD-I system uses a television set for display. Unlike most multimedia standards, a CD-I does not require a computer system.

Reference-contexts: Recent progress in computer hardware and software has facilitated access and exchange of digital multimedia information. Even though the importance of multimedia is widely recognized, interpretations of the term "multimedia" vary widely. Here we offer the following, purposely general, definition <ref> [21] </ref>: Multimedia refers to the integrated generation, representation, processing, storage, and dissemination of independent machine processable information expressed in multiple time-dependent and time-independent media such as data, graphics, drawings, voice, audio, and video.
