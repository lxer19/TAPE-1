Abstract: It follows from work of Andrews and Bressoud that for t 1, the number of partitions of n with all successive ranks at least t is equal to the number of partitions of n with no part of size 2 t. We give a simple bijection for this identity which generalizes a result of Cheema and Gordon for 2-rowed plane partitions. The bijection yields several refinements of the identity when the partition counts are parametrized by the number of parts and/or the size of the Durfee rectangle. In addition, it gives an interpretation of the difference of (shifted) successive Gaussian polynomials which we relate to other interpretations of Andrews and Fishel.
