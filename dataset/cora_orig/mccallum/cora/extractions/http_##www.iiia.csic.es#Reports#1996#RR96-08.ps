Abstract: One of the goals of a variety of approximate reasoning models is to cope with inference patterns more flexible than those of classical reasoning. Among them, similarity-based reasoning aims at modelling notions of resemblance or proximity among propositions and consequence relations which make sense in such a setting. One way of proceeding is to equip the set of interpretations or posible worlds with a similarity relation , that is, a reflexive, symmetric and t-norm transitive fuzzy relation. In this paper we explore a modal approach to similarity-based reasoning and we define three multi-modal systems with similarity-based Kripke model semantics. A similarity-based Kripke model is a structure , in which is the set of possible worlds, represent an assignment of possible worlds to atomic formulas, and is a similarity function , where is a subset of the unit interval [0, 1] such that . We provide soundness and completeness results for these systems with respect to some classes of the above structures.
