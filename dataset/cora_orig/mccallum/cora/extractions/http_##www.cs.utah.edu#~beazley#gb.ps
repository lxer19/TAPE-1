Abstract: We present timings and performance numbers for a new short range three dimensional (3D) molecular dynamics (MD) code, SPaSM, on the Connection Machine-5 (CM-5). We demonstrate that runs with more than 10 8 particles are now possible on massively parallel MIMD computers. To the best of our knowledge this is at least an order of magnitude more particles than what has previously been reported. Typical production runs show sustained performance (including communication) in the range of 47-50 GFlops on a 1024 node CM-5 with vector units (VUs). The speed of the code scales linearly with the number of processors and with the number of particles and shows 95% parallel efficiency in the speedup.

Reference-contexts: Ideally one would like to use the MD method for second long simulations with at least 10 9 atoms. While this goal is still very far away, there is substantial current interest in the development of fast MD algorithms <ref> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] </ref> which allow for the simulation of at least million atom systems. We have developed an new scalable MD algorithm based on a message-passing multi-cell approach which allows for simulating at least 10 8 particles interacting via a relative short range potential.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the best reported time to date <ref> [6] </ref>. Using minimal parallel memory caching, we were also able to simulate 180 million particles with an update time of 55.6 seconds. In Fig. 5 we illustrate the scaling properties of our code.

Here we briefly outline its main features, illustrating the algorithm in 2D, but it extends naturally to 3D. Space is considered to be a rectangular region with periodic boundary conditions.
