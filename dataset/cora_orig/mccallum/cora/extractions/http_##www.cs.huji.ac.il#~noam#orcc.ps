Abstract: We present several results regarding randomized one-round communication complexity. These include a connection to the VC dimension, a study of the problem of computing the inner product of two real valued vectors, and a relation between "simultaneous" protocols and one-round protocols.

Reference-contexts: We allow them bounded, two-sided error. We study very simple types of protocols which include only one round of communication. These protocols were also studied by Ablayev <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> This has been independently observed by Ablayev <ref> [1] </ref>. We then study the power of this lower bound technique and show that it essentially characterizes the distributional complexity of the worst-case product distribution (denoted by R A!B;[] (f).) Theorem: R A!B (f ) R A!B;[] (f) = fi (V C-dim (f X )). <p> For the `'th repetition of this process, let X ` be the value of the q i corresponding to the index i sent by Alice. Bob then outputs the average of the X ` 's. The X ` 's are random variables which take values in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and whose expect value is P n j=1 p j q j , the inner product between ~p and ~q. <p> For a vector ~u 2 B n 2 , let g 2;1 (~u), be the probability vector over the messages Alice may send Bob according to P , given that she received ~u as input. Let q i;j (~v) be the probability that Bob outputs j 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, given that Alice sent the ith message, and he received ~v as input, 9 and let q i (~v) = j (q i;j (~v) j).

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, IN P par 1;1 is complete for the class of (boolean) functions whose one-round randomized complexity is polylog (n). Here completeness is under rectangular reductions as introduced by Babai, Frankl, and Simon <ref> [3] </ref>. We also present an interesting application of the above theorems. Let B n 1 , B n 1 , be the sets of n-dimensional real vectors whose L 1 , L 2 , and L 1 norm, respectively, is bounded by 1. Then we prove the following theorem. <p> It is interesting to note, that though it is known that even for multi-round communication complexity R (DISJ ) = (n), [7, 12], the upper bound on multi-round rectangular distributional complexity is lower <ref> [3] </ref>: R [] (DISJ) = O ( p n log (n)). Thus, our example shows a quadratic gap between R A!B;[] (f), and R [] (f ). <p> It is interesting to note that in the case of multi rounds communication complexity there are only examples showing a polynomial (quadratic) gap between R [] (f ) and R (f ) <ref> [3, 7, 12] </ref>. Theorem 5 There exists a function f for which R A!B;[] (f ) = O (1), while R A!B (f ) = (n). <p> First we need to define completeness in this context. This is done using rectangular reductions, which were introduced in <ref> [3] </ref>. Definition 4.1 Let X; X 0 ; Y; Y 0 and Z be arbitrary sets. Let f : X fi Y ! Z, and let f 0 : X 0 fi Y 0 ! Z.

Reference-contexts: If this is not the case then Alice can simply send bob the L 2 norm of ~u within a small additive error, using a constant number of bits. In the public-coin protocol we are about to describe, we apply a technique presented in <ref> [5] </ref>. In particular, we need the following lemma: Lemma [5] Let ~u and ~v be two n-dimensional real vectors whose L 2 norm is 1. Let ~r be a random n-dimensional real vector whose L 2 norm is 1. <p> In the public-coin protocol we are about to describe, we apply a technique presented in <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Applying Theorem 3, we get the upper bound on R A!B;[] (GT ). The proof of the lower bound on R A!B (GT ) is given in <ref> [9] </ref>. We describe a simpler proof to a slightly weaker bound of (n= log n). Let P be a randomized private-coin protocol for GT whose cost is R A!B (GT ).

Reference-contexts: Let R * (f ) denote max D A!B; * , where the maximum is taken over all product distributions. Finally, we shall need the following theorem of Newman <ref> [10] </ref>, which gives an upper bound on private-coin complexity in terms of public-coin complexity. Theorem 2 ([10]) Let f : X fi Y ! f0; 1g, where X and Y are arbitrary finite sets. <p> the cosine function is bounded by 1, Bob can use this estimate to compute, with high probability, the value of (~u; ~v) within an additive error * 2 = O (1= p In order to get the upper bound on R A!B (IN P 2;2 ), we apply Newman's theorem <ref> [10] </ref>, quoted in Theorem 2. Though the theorem is not directly applicable in our case since it applies to functions defined on finite domains X and Y , we need only make the following observation.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper we are concerned with randomized two-party communication complexity as defined by Yao <ref> [14] </ref>: Alice holds an input x, Bob holds an input y, and they wish to compute a given function f (x; y), to which end they communicate with each other via a randomized protocol. We allow them bounded, two-sided error.

The following fundamental theorem proven by Yao <ref> [15] </ref>, characterizes public-coin complexity in terms of distributional (deterministic) complexity.
