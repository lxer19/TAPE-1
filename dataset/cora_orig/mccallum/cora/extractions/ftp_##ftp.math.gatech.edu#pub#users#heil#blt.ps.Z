Abstract: The Balian-Low theorem (BLT) is a key result in time-frequency analysis, originally This paper presents a tutorial on Gabor systems, the BLT, and related topics, such as the Zak transform and Wilson bases. Because of the fact that (g 0 ) ^ (fl) = 2ifl ^g(fl), the role of differentiation in the proof of the BLT is examined carefully. The major new contributions of this paper are the construction of a complete Gabor system of the form fe 2ib m t g(t a n )g such that f(a n ; b m )g has density strictly less than 1, an Amalgam BLT that provides distinct restrictions on Gabor systems fe 2imbt g(t na)g that form exact frames, and a new proof of the BLT for exact frames that does not require differentiation and relies only on classical real variable methods from harmonic analysis.

Reference-contexts: This amounts to considering sequences ff (t)g t2Z in place of functions f . Our discussion is based on [Wal89b] and [Hei89]. However, as with the usual Zak transform, the discrete Zak transform has been independently considered by other authors, for example, <ref> [AGT92] </ref>. Let g = fg (t)g t2Z be a sequence in ` 2 (Z), so that P jg (t)j 2 &lt; 1. As with the usual Gabor systems, we define new sequences g mb;na by translating and modulating g.

Reference-contexts: As with many useful concepts, the Zak transform has been rediscovered many times, and also goes by the name Weil-Brezin transform and k-q transform. For properties and history of the Zak transform we refer to <ref> [AT75] </ref>, [DGM86], [HW89], [Jan82], [Jan88], [Zak75]. <p> The Zak transform has the remarkable property that if Zg is continuous on all of R fi ^ R (not just on the subset Q) then Zg has a zero in Q. A proof can be found in [HW89, Theorem 4.3.4]. For original proofs and related results, see <ref> [AT75, p. 18] </ref>, [BGZ75], [BZ81], [Jan82], [Zak75]. In light of Theorem 3.1, the continuity|or lack thereof|of Zg is a major influence on any approach to proving the BLT. Note for example that if g = 1 [0;1) then Zg = 1 on Q.

Reference-contexts: In this sense, Theorem 4.1 circumvents the restrictions of the BLT. An example of a function g 2 L 2 (R) satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem 4.1 and such that both g and ^g have exponential decay was constructed in [DJJ91]. Theorem 4.1 has been generalized by Auscher <ref> [Aus94] </ref>. 4.2. Theorem. Assume that jg (t)j C (1 + jtj) 1* for some * &gt; 0. <p> an orthonormal basis for L 2 (R) if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied. 8 k 2 Z; n 2 ) g (t n 8 k 2 Z; n 2 1 2 ) = 0 a.e. (4.3) If ^g is real-valued then (4.3) is automatically satisfied (see <ref> [Aus94, x5.2.3] </ref>). In this case, (4.2) is equivalent to the statement that fg m;n=2 g forms a tight frame for L 2 (R) with frame bound 2 [DJJ91], 374 J. J. Benedetto, C. Heil, and D. F. Walnut [Aus94]. <p> In this case, (4.2) is equivalent to the statement that fg m;n=2 g forms a tight frame for L 2 (R) with frame bound 2 [DJJ91], 374 J. J. Benedetto, C. Heil, and D. F. Walnut <ref> [Aus94] </ref>. Therefore, in order to construct a Wilson basis whose elements have good smoothness and decay, it suffices to construct a tight Gabor frame fg m;n=2 g such that ^g is real-valued and g has both good smoothness and good decay. We shall construct examples of such functions. <p> Example. We shall construct a function g 2 C 1 c (R) such that f `;k g is an orthonormal basis for L 2 (R).

Distributional Calculations and the Continuity of the Zak Transform We devote this section to investigating relationships between differentiation and the continuity of the Zak transform.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction 1.1. History The Balian-Low theorem (BLT) is a key result in time-frequency analysis. It was originally stated by Balian <ref> [Bal81] </ref> and, independently, by Low [Low85], as: If a Gabor system fe 2imbt g (t na)g m;n2Z with ab = 1 forms an orthonormal basis for L 2 (R) = ff : R 1 1 jf (t)j 2 dt &lt; 1g then Z 1 jt g (t)j 2 dt 1 1991 <p> Remark. The BLT is reasonable not only from the point of view of modern physics, as demonstrated in <ref> [Bal81] </ref>, [Low85], but also in the tradition of classical analysis. We list the following instances. a. Given g, tg (t) 2 L 2 (R) and fl^g (fl) 2 L 2 ( ^ R), and let G = Zg.

Reference-contexts: Thus the notions of exact frame, bounded unconditional basis, and Riesz basis coincide. Proofs of these equivalences can be found in [You80], and are due to Kothe [Kot36] and Duffin and Schaeffer [DS52], with important related contributions by Bari <ref> [Bar51] </ref>. Whether it forms a basis or not, any frame ff k g allows series representations of elements f 2 H: There will exist coefficients c k (f ) so that f = P c k (f ) f k .

Reference-contexts: This gap was independently addressed in two ways. Battle provided an elegant and entirely new proof based on the operator theory associated with the Classical Uncertainty Principle Inequality <ref> [Bat88] </ref>. Daubechies, Coifman, and Semmes retained the original approach of Balian and Low, filling the gap directly [Dau90]. <p> The Uncertainty Principle Approach to the BLT We shall present a proof of the BLT due to Daubechies and Janssen [DJ93], based on the operator theory associated with the Classical Uncertainty Principle Inequality and inspired by the elegant proof of the BLT for orthornormal bases by Battle <ref> [Bat88] </ref>. We shall use the basic properties of frames, Gabor systems, and the Zak transform discussed in x2.1, x2.2, and x3.1. In particular, we may consider only Gabor systems with a = b = 1. <p> Example. a. If the Gabor frame fg m;n g is actually an orthonormal basis, then ~g = g and the equivalence is clear. This is precisely Battle's proof of the BLT <ref> [Bat88] </ref>. b. If g generates a tight exact frame with bounds A = B then ~g = S 1 g = A 1 g, and the equivalence is again clear. However, any tight exact frame is a multiple of an orthonormal basis. c.

The theorem as stated here was proved in [CS93, Theorem 2]. The remainder of this subsection is devoted to examining the converse of Theorem 3.5. First, the BLT implies that the converse of Theorem 3.5a fails. 3.6. Proposition. <p> Proposition. There exists a function g 2 L 2 (R) satisfying (3.5) but not (3.4). Proof. Let g (t) = e t 2 . Then g certainly satisfies (3.5) for some A &gt; 0. Moreover, fg m;n g is a Bessel sequence, that is, (3.6) holds [Dau90, Theorem 2.5], <ref> [HW89, Proposition 4.2.1] </ref>, [Wal92, Theorem 3.1]. However, by the BLT, fg m;n g is not a frame. Therefore (3.4) cannot hold. fl The converse of Theorem 3.5b is false as well. 3.7. Proposition. There exists a function g 2 L 2 (R) satisfying (3.7) but not (3.6). Proof. <p> supp (h) [1=2; 1=2], (b) h is even and real-valued (so ^ h is real-valued as well), and (c) there exist constants A, B &gt; 0 such that A P In this case, fh m;n=2 g forms a frame for L 2 (R) with frame bounds A and B [Dau90], <ref> [HW89] </ref>. The corresponding frame operator is Sf = f , where (t) = P jh (t n=2)j 2 . In addition, S 1=2 f = f 1=2 . <p> Moreover, `;k 2 S (R) and ( `;k ) ^ 2 C 1 c (R) for each ` and k. fl It is possible to describe the frame operator S for a Gabor frame fg m;n=2 g in terms of the Zak transform [Dau90], [Dau92], <ref> [HW89] </ref>, cf. Theorem 3.1. 4.6. Theorem. Given g 2 L 2 (R). <p> Then, as in the proof that continuous quasiperiodic functions have zeros, we have that for t 2 [0; 1], ' r (t; 1) = ' r (t; 0) + 2k r ; for some integer k r independent of t (for example, <ref> [HW89] </ref>). Now let us consider the function ffi r (t; !) = 1 + e 2i! G r (t; !) Clearly ffi r is continuous. <p> However, any tight exact frame is a multiple of an orthonormal basis. c. If supp (g) is contained in an interval of length 1, then the frame operator S is Sf = f , where (t) = P jg (t n)j 2 (for example, <ref> [HW89] </ref>). Any Gabor frame must have A (t) B a.e. (Theorem 3.5), so S is multiplication by an essentially constant function. Therefore, ~g = S 1 ~g = g=, and thus P g 2 L 2 (R) if and only if P ~g 2 L 2 (R).

Ramanathan and Steger <ref> [RaS95] </ref> recently improved Landau's result to apply to all g 2 L 2 (R). Their proof relied on a simple dimension counting technique. Moreover, if fl actually forms a rectangular lattice, their technique recovers the full Rieffel incompleteness result. Specifically, they proved the following theorem [RaS95]. 2.2. Theorem. <p> Ramanathan and Steger <ref> [RaS95] </ref> recently improved Landau's result to apply to all g 2 L 2 (R). Their proof relied on a simple dimension counting technique. Moreover, if fl actually forms a rectangular lattice, their technique recovers the full Rieffel incompleteness result. Specifically, they proved the following theorem [RaS95]. 2.2. Theorem. <p> Ramanathan and Steger conjectured in <ref> [RaS95] </ref> that Theorem 2.2 can be further improved to say that fg p;q g (q;p)2fl must be incomplete when fl is a uniformly discrete set with D + (fl) &lt; 1. We show in x2.4 that this conjecture is false. Thus Theorem 2.2 is the best possible result. <p> Ramanathan and Steger proved that density 1 is also a necessary condition for a Gabor system to be a Riesz basis <ref> [RaS95] </ref>, as follows. 2.3. Theorem. Let g 2 L 2 (R), and let fl R fi ^ R be a uniformly discrete set. If fl has uniform Beurling density D (fl) and if fg p;q g (q;p)2fl is an exact frame for L 2 (R), then D (fl) = 1. <p> In particular, the hypothesis in the BLT (Theorem 1.1) that ab = 1 is redundant, being a consequence of the hypothesis that the Gabor system is an exact frame. This fact had not been established prior to <ref> [RaS95] </ref>, even in the case of a rectangular lattice fl. Thus, a Gabor frame with uniform Beurling density exceeding 1 will be inexact. Any inexact frame is overcomplete, that is, some elements of the frame can be deleted without destroying the completeness of the system.

Reference-contexts: J. Benedetto, C. Heil, and D. F. Walnut As a corollary of other results on C fl algebras, Rieffel <ref> [Rie81] </ref> proved that fg mb;na g is incomplete for any g if ab &gt; 1. This can be viewed as a Nyquist phenomenon for Gabor systems.

Background 2.1. <p> The proof of the following result is routine, e.g., [Maz85, pp. 8-9], <ref> [Sch66, Theorem 2.III (pp. 53-54) and Theorem 2.V (pp. 57-59)] </ref>. 5.1. Theorem. a. <p> By properties of the Zak transform, ~ G has zeros. Therefore, fg m;n g is not a frame. We have shown that the phenomenon exhibited by the BLT follows easily with the added hypothesis (5.5). b. In the setting of R 2 , Krylov's theorem <ref> [Sch66, pp. 181-185] </ref> asserts that if a distribution G has the properties @ 1 G; @ 2 G 2 L 2 loc (R 2 ), then G n 2 L 1 loc (R 2 ) for all n 1. <p> the following fact also based on Sobolev's work: If a distribution G has the properties @ 1 G; @ 2 G 2 L 2 loc (R 2 ) then G 2 L 1 loc (R 2 ) Differentiation and the Balian-Low Theorem 381 satisfies an L p loc Lipschitz condition <ref> [Sch66, pp. 185-188] </ref>. If G were actually continuous we could use our argument from part a to verify the BLT. In Remark 5.4a we gave a simple proof of the BLT in the case that additional smoothness, viz., (5.5), is assumed.

Reference-contexts: Another contribution of this paper appears in x6, which is devoted to the Coifman-Semmes-Daubechies approach to the BLT.

This represents an attempt to understand the role of differentiation in the BLT in terms of inequalities related to variations of the Zak transform over small cubes.

Reference-contexts: As with many useful concepts, the Zak transform has been rediscovered many times, and also goes by the name Weil-Brezin transform and k-q transform.

In light of Theorem 3.1, the continuity|or lack thereof|of Zg is a major influence on any approach to proving the BLT. Note for example that if g = 1 [0;1) then Zg = 1 on Q. However, by quasiperiodicity, Zg is not continuous on R fi ^ R.
