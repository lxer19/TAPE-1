Title: MATCHING PURSUIT FOR COMPRESSION AND APPLICATION TO MOTION COMPENSATED VIDEO CODING

Abstract: In many hybrid video compression algorithms there is a clear distinction between motion estimation and compensation (MEMC) on the one hand, and transform coding of the residue on the other hand. By translating MEMC into the framework of Matching Pursuit (MP), we will show that unification of both steps is possible. Moreover, adapting the MP approach to the small size dictionaries involved in MEMC, it is shown that unification may in principle lead to a better performance of hybrid coding schemes. We close with a discussion on the practical obstacles of the technique, and how to avoid them.

Reference-contexts: Designing a good dictionary in this rate-distortion sense is a difficult problem, since it amounts to a vector quantization (VQ) codebook design problem. Actually, it can be seen that matching pursuit compression is a cascade VQ scheme, where the VQ is of the gain-shape type <ref> [1] </ref>. However, the size of vectors we consider is usually much larger than what is used in VQ (e.g. 64 in the example considered below).

Reference-contexts: Typically, jDj = M is larger than N , and thus f k g is a redundant or over complete set of vectors in H. Matching pursuit <ref> [2] </ref> is a greedy algorithm to match an input signal f 2 H by a linear combination of k 's.

Reference-contexts: Thus, even in finite dimensional spaces, the matching pursuit will usually converge slowly, while an orthogonalized version will converge in N steps <ref> [3] </ref>. We derived an orthogonal matching pursuit based on Gram-Schmitt orthogonalization that simply keeps an orthogonal set of best matches. The idea is to successively project the remaining vectors onto the orthogonal complement with respect to the current (orthogonal) set of chosen vectors.
