Title: Disjoint Paths in Densely Embedded Graphs  
Author: Jon Kleinberg Eva Tardos 
Date: October, 1995  
Abstract: We consider the following maximum disjoint paths problem (mdpp). We are given a large network, and pairs of nodes that wish to communicate over paths through the network | the goal is to simultaneously connect as many of these pairs as possible in such a way that no two communication paths share an edge in the network. This classical problem has been brought into focus recently in papers discussing applications to routing in high-speed networks, where the current lack of understanding of the mdpp is an obstacle to the design of practical heuristics. We consider the class of densely embedded, nearly-Eulerian graphs, which includes the two-dimensional mesh and many other planar and locally planar interconnection networks. We obtain a constant-factor approximation algorithm for the maximum disjoint paths problem for this class of graphs; this improves on an O(log n)-approximation for the special case of the two-dimensional mesh due to Aumann-Rabani and the authors. For networks that are not explicitly required to be "high-capacity," this is the first constant-factor approximation for the mdpp in any class of graphs other than trees. We also consider the mdpp in the on-line setting, relevant to applications in which connection requests arrive over time and must be processed immediately. Here we obtain an asymptotically optimal O(log n)-competitive on-line algorithm for the same class of graphs; this improves on an O(log n log log n)-competitive algorithm for the special case of the mesh due to Awerbuch, Gawlick, Leighton, and Rabani.

Reference-contexts: Our interest in this problem comes from two main sources. First, establishing disjoint paths is fundamental to routing in high-speed networks (see for example the applications mentioned in [6, 8, 21], as well as applications to optical routing in <ref> [1, 3, 24] </ref>). <p> can be done in polynomial time); from this, we obtain for each terminal pair (s i ; t i ) a collection of paths P 1 i ; : : : ; P z i and associated weights y 1 i ; : : : ; y z i 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> such that x i = P j i 2 [0; 1]. <p> each terminal pair (s i ; t i ) a collection of paths P 1 i ; : : : ; P z i and associated weights y 1 i ; : : : ; y z i 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> such that x i = P j i 2 [0; 1]. We now pick a scaling factor &lt; 1; independently for each terminal pair (s i ; t i ) we route it on path P j i with probability y j don't route it at all with probability 1 x i . <p> Corollary 3.14 Let 0 &lt; &lt; 1, and p 1 ; : : : ; p r 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Let X 0 1 ; X 0 r be independent Bernoulli trials with EX 0 j = p j and 0 = i X 0 P i p i . Then P r [ 0 &gt; m] &lt; (e) m : Proof. <p> So what is the probability that a terminal s, which is given weight f s 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> by the fractional optimum, survives? First we consider the probability that s is contained in a fixed overfull p fi q rectangle R, given that s has been rounded up. <p> Finally, we also use the the terms curve (continuous image of <ref> [0; 1] </ref>) and closed curve (continuous image of S 1 ). Our class of graphs is defined to satisfy analogues of properties (i), (ii), and (iii) locally.

Reference-contexts: Deciding whether T can be routed with congestion equal to 1 is the same as deciding whether T is realizable; but as an optimization problem, minimizing congestion is much better understood. Aspnes et al. <ref> [2] </ref> give an on-line O (log n)-competitive algorithm for the problem; and a randomized rounding algorithm of Raghavan and Thompson [23] gives a routing off-line with congestion at most OP T + o (OP T ) + O (log n), where OP T denotes the optimum congestion.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the randomized rounding technique of Raghavan and Thompson [23, 22] can be used to obtain an off-line constant-factor approximation.

If H is a graph with n nodes in which each edge has capacity at least log 2n, the algorithm of [4] achieves a competitive ratio of 2 log 4n. <p> Suppose there are a total of k requests. Let A denote the set of requests routed by the AAP algorithm. Then we show 2 1+1=" log j2A X c k+1 As in the proof in <ref> [4] </ref> we show this by induction on the number of admitted requests, via proving that if the algorithm admits the j th request, we have X c j+1 e 2 1+1=" n log : So consider edge e on the j th path used by the AAP algorithm. <p> A lower bound of <ref> [4] </ref> implies that the factor of 2 1=" is unavoidable for deterministic on-line algorithms. 2.2 Combining On-Line Algorithms In routing connections on-line, we will adopt an approach in which the decision whether to accept a given connection is made by a combination of several algorithms | the connection is accepted if <p> These will serve as the nodes of N . We now label some pairs of subsquares as "neighbors" and connect them with (log n) parallel edges; these are the high-capacity edges of N . On this network N we run the algorithm of Awerbuch, Azar, and Plotkin <ref> [4] </ref> in the on-line case, and the algorithm of Raghavan and Thompson [23] in the off-line case. The algorithms running in N will return routes consisting of a sequence of neighboring subsquares. To convert such a route into a path in G, we construct disjoint paths between neighboring subsquares.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, robust ways are known for converting algorithms for the mdpp into algorithms that can handle connections of limited duration or variable value <ref> [5] </ref>; thus, the difficulties contained in these more elaborate routing problems seem to stem mainly from the intractability of the mdpp. This problem is also of basic interest in algorithmic graph theory. <p> For trees with parallel edges, Garg, Vazirani, and Yan-nakakis [11] obtain an off-line 2-approximation (the maximization problem is NP-complete, though deciding realizability is easy); Awerbuch et. al.

Reference-contexts: A linear-time algorithm for this problem has recently been obtained by Wagner and Weihe [30]. We will use an extension of the Okamura-Seymour, due to Frank <ref> [9] </ref>, which concerns the case in which the parity condition does need not to hold on the face containing the terminals. <p> We build crossbars using an extension of the Okamura-Seymour theorem [20] due to Frank <ref> [9] </ref>, along the same lines as was done in [14]. <p> We are dealing with a disjoint paths problem in a planar graph with all terminals on the outer face. Moreover, every node of G v not on the outer face has even degree. In such a case, Frank's extension of the Okamura-Seymour theorem <ref> [9, 20] </ref> says that following strict cut condition is sufficient for the realizability of T v | every non-trivial cut has more capacity than the number of terminal pairs it separates. 28 It is enough to consider non-trivial cuts of the form ffi (U ) with both G v [U ] <p> Let U 00 B 8~ 2 r denote a simple set extension of B 8~r (v), as in Lemma 4.6. For a constant 0 , we can pick a set S of vertices on the outer facial cycle of U 0 spaced 0 apart, and use Frank's theorem <ref> [9] </ref> as in Lemma 5.6 to construct a set of edge-disjoint paths connecting "antipodal" pairs in S, such that all paths stay within U 00 n U 0 .

Reference-contexts: In this case, a theorem of Okamura and Seymour <ref> [20] </ref> says that the realizability of T in G can be decided in polynomial time; and in fact the following cut condition is sufficient for realizability: one cannot remove j edges from G and separate more than j terminal pairs. <p> The major problems are the following. (1) We used the natural crossbars inside a mesh for routing; do these enclosures have similar crossbars inside them? (2) Where is the high-capacity simulated network N ? To build crossbars inside the enclosures we use the Okamura-Seymour theorem <ref> [20] </ref>, analogously to a construction in our earlier paper [14]. To define the high-capacity simulated network N we want to grow the enclosures out until they touch. <p> We build crossbars using an extension of the Okamura-Seymour theorem <ref> [20] </ref> due to Frank [9], along the same lines as was done in [14]. <p> We are dealing with a disjoint paths problem in a planar graph with all terminals on the outer face. Moreover, every node of G v not on the outer face has even degree. In such a case, Frank's extension of the Okamura-Seymour theorem <ref> [9, 20] </ref> says that following strict cut condition is sufficient for the realizability of T v | every non-trivial cut has more capacity than the number of terminal pairs it separates. 28 It is enough to consider non-trivial cuts of the form ffi (U ) with both G v [U ]

Reference-contexts: It turns out that our definition of uniformly densely embedded graphs could also have been expressed in these terms. We say that a closed curve on is null-homotopic if it is homotopic to a point; it is well-known (see e.g. <ref> [25] </ref>) that a closed curve is null-homotopic if and only if it is contained in a -disc. Now we say that a drawing of G on is c-representative [25, 26] if any non-null-homotopic closed curve on meets the drawing of G at least c times. <p> We say that a closed curve on is null-homotopic if it is homotopic to a point; it is well-known (see e.g. [25]) that a closed curve is null-homotopic if and only if it is contained in a -disc.

Reference-contexts: In a series of papers proving, among other things, that the disjoint paths problem for a fixed number of terminal pairs is solvable in polynomial time <ref> [27] </ref>, Robertson and Seymour make use of another notion of "denseness" of surface embeddings | namely representativity.

Reference-contexts: We will use an extension of the Okamura-Seymour, due to Frank [9], which concerns the case in which the parity condition does need not to hold on the face containing the terminals. We also use a theorem of Schrijver <ref> [28] </ref> that provides an algorithm for finding vertex-disjoint paths in a graph embedded on a compact surface , such that the paths satisfy given homotopy constraints. 2 Preliminary Tools 2.1 The AAP Algorithm We make use of a variant of an on-line mdpp algorithm of Awerbuch, Azar, and Plotkin [4]. <p> In particular, we need to show that all paths accepted by the simulated network can be routed in G. For this we make use of a theorem of Schrijver <ref> [28] </ref>; we show that there exist (log n) paths in G between the neighboring enclosures, such that all paths between all pairs are mutually disjoint. We make no attempt to optimize constants here. <p> Proof. The proof is based on the following theorem of Schrijver <ref> [28] </ref>. <p> Call a collection of curves R on 1 essential if it consists either of a single closed curve that is not null-homotopic, or it is a finite union of curves each with endpoints on the boundary of 1 . Schrijver <ref> [28] </ref> proves that such vertex-disjoint paths and cycles exist if for each essential collection of curves R, there are curves fB i g, where B i is homotopic to A i , such that R intersects the drawing of H more than it intersects the curves fB i g. (The main <p> such vertex-disjoint paths and cycles exist if for each essential collection of curves R, there are curves fB i g, where B i is homotopic to A i , such that R intersects the drawing of H more than it intersects the curves fB i g. (The main result of <ref> [28] </ref> is in fact a necessary and sufficient condition; this weaker statement suffices for our purposes. Additionally, [28] is stated for the special case of surfaces without boundary, but the extension we use here follows immediately from [28].) Say that a curve is G-normal if it meets the drawing of G <p> fB i g, where B i is homotopic to A i , such that R intersects the drawing of H more than it intersects the curves fB i g. (The main result of <ref> [28] </ref> is in fact a necessary and sufficient condition; this weaker statement suffices for our purposes. Additionally, [28] is stated for the special case of surfaces without boundary, but the extension we use here follows immediately from [28].) Say that a curve is G-normal if it meets the drawing of G only at vertices, and define its G-length to be the number of times it meets the drawing. <p> more than it intersects the curves fB i g. (The main result of <ref> [28] </ref> is in fact a necessary and sufficient condition; this weaker statement suffices for our purposes. Additionally, [28] is stated for the special case of surfaces without boundary, but the extension we use here follows immediately from [28].) Say that a curve is G-normal if it meets the drawing of G only at vertices, and define its G-length to be the number of times it meets the drawing. <p> Proof. If curves R and R 0 are homotopic, we write R ~ R 0 . We extend this notation to finite collections of curves R, R 0 in the obvious way. Following notation of Schrijver <ref> [28] </ref>, the number of crossings of R 0 and R 1 is denoted cr (R 0 ; R 1 ), and we define mincr (R 0 ; R 1 ) = minfcr (R 0 0 ; R 0 0 ; R 1 ~ R 0 By the theorem of Schrijver [28] <p> <ref> [28] </ref>, the number of crossings of R 0 and R 1 is denoted cr (R 0 ; R 1 ), and we define mincr (R 0 ; R 1 ) = minfcr (R 0 0 ; R 0 0 ; R 1 ~ R 0 By the theorem of Schrijver [28] given above, the desired paths exist if for each essential collection of curves R on 0 , one has cr (R; G 0 ) &gt; (u;u 0 ) mincr (R; A uu 0 ): (4) 31 Note that in verifying this inequality, we may assume R is G 0 -normal,
