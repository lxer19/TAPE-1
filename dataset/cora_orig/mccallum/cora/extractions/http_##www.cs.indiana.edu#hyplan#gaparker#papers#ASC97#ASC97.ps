Abstract: Gait generation is an integral part of a legged robot control. Hexapod gaits require the coordination of the simultaneous movement of all six legs in a cycle of activations. The problem is compounded when working with actual robots due to the variability in their capabilities. A learning algorithm that can optimize with the differences between and within robots would greatly reduce engineering calculations and increase robot adaptability. To be effective for the simplest of robot controllers, these algorithms should produce sequences of activations that can be used directly on the robot. Evolutionary computation would be ideal for this learning algorithm although few of its forms have a structure that conforms naturally to the cyclic nature of gaits. In previous work, we developed Cyclic Genetic Algorithms (CGAs), which are a variation on the basis genetic algorithm. Tests on robot simulations showed that these algorithms could rapidly converge to evolve the optimal tripod gait. In this paper, we successfully apply CGAs to an actual robot that is not only more complicated then the original simulation, but also has the increased variability innate in actual robots.

Reference-contexts: The difficulty comes in that most forms of evolutionary computation are not naturally equipped to handle the cyclic nature of gaits. One exception is with genetic programming, which can be used to evolve programs and programs can have loops. Graham Spencer <ref> [1] </ref> had some success in generating programs for hexapod gaits using genetic programming. His programs, tested only on robot simulations, resulted in gaits that maintained sustained forward movement but could not obtain the optimal tripod gait. Another important facet of robot control development is testing on actual robots.

Reference-contexts: Another important facet of robot control development is testing on actual robots. Simulations alone cannot adequately predict the behavior of actual physical agents. Randall Beer and John Gallagher <ref> [2] </ref> used genetic algorithms to develop neural network controllers for a simulated hexapod robot. In later work, they tested these controllers on an actual robot [3]. Tripod gaits resulted in both the simulated and actual robots.

Although promising for robots with complex controllers that have some a priori structure conducive to tripod gaits, this technique is inappropriate for small inexpensive robots that require a repeatable sequence of activations for control.

In previous work <ref> [4] </ref>, we developed Cyclic Genetic Algorithms (CGAs) to solve these cyclic sequence problems by generating the proper sequence of primitive instructions that can be continually repeated to produce a gait.

Reference-contexts: The CGA used this model to develop an optimal gait that was specific to the robot's capabilities. This gait was subsequently downloaded into the actual robot where its performance was confirmed to correspond to the performance of the model. CYCLIC GENETIC ALGORITHMS Genetic Algorithms, introduced by John Holland <ref> [5] </ref>, are based on the laws of natural selection and survival of the fittest. The basic algorithm consists of three genetic operators (selection, crossover, and mutation) that are used to transform a randomly generated population into an optimal (or near optimal) one.
