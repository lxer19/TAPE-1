Title: Kinematics-Driven Geometric Modeling: A Framework For Simultaneous NC Tool-Path Generation and Sculptured Surface Design

Abstract: Current practice in CAD/CAM separates the process of geometric shape design from that of CNC (Computer Numerically Controlled) tool path generation. Although successful for 3-axis machining, this strategy is not as effective for 5-axis machining of sculptured surfaces due to the difficulty in generating accurate and gouge-free 5-axis tool paths from the CAD models. This paper presents a framework for a new, kinematics-based methodology for geometric modeling that integrates sculptured-surface design with too-path generation for 5-axis CNC machining. In particular, sculptured surfaces are represented directly in terms of rational Bezier and B-spline motions of the cutting tool. The proposed framework brings together the fields of Kinematics and Computer Aided Geometric Design as well as the recent results in Computer Aided Motion Synthesis and Swept Volume Modeling and provides a basis for concurrent geometric shape design and manufacture.

Reference-contexts: The ho mogeneous representation of [R] is given by <ref> (Bottema and Roth, 1979) </ref>: [R] = [A (Q)]=S 2 where the matrix [A (Q)] is given by [A]= 4 4 +Q 2 2 Q 2 2 (Q 2 Q 1 +Q 4 Q 3 ) Q 2 1 +Q 2 3 2 (Q 2 Q 3 Q 4 Q 1 ) <p> The motion is therefore called a rational motion of degree n <ref> (Bottema and Roth, 1979) </ref>. As discussed earlier, there exist two different homogeneous parameterization for spatial displacements: (Q; D) and (Q; Q 0 ). If these parameters are defined as polynomial functions of time t, we obtain two different representations of rational motions.

Reference-contexts: Since rational Bezier (or B-spline) curves can be generated from repeated linear interpolation using the deCasteljau (or deBoor) algorithm <ref> (Farin, 1993) </ref>, in what follows, we start with linear interpolation in which correspond to screw-motion interpolation in E 3 . Let ^ Q 0 = Q 0 + *Q 0 1 represent two configurations (or displacements) M 0 and M 1 of a rigid body.

Reference-contexts: The linear interpolant in the Image Space , where ^w 0 and ^w 1 are dual-number weights, corresponds a rational screw motion from M 0 to M 1 about the screw axis between M 0 to M 1 <ref> (see Ge and Ravani 1994) </ref>. For practical purposes, the weights ^w 0 and ^w 1 are chosen to be real positive numbers. The choice of weights affects the pitch of the screw motion.

Reference-contexts: If Q and Q 0 are defined as a linear function of time, then the resulting motion [H (Q (t); Q 0 (t))] is a quadratic rational motion. It has been shown that this motion is a screw motion about a fixed axis in E 3 <ref> (Ravani and Ge, 1991) </ref>. Computer aided design methods for synthesizing rational motions of the form [H (Q (t); D (t))] have been developed systematically by Juttler (1994), Juttler and Wagner (1995), and Wagner (1994) 1 .

Reference-contexts: Duality between points and planes in projective three-space is discussed in standard text on projective geometry. Recently, this property has been used in CAGD for designing developable sur faces (Hoschek, 1983; Bodduluri and Ravani, 1993 and 1994; Pottmann and Farin, 1995) and for studying the envelopes of plane trajectories <ref> (Wagner, 1994) </ref>. If two-parameter motion ^ Q (t; s) is used, then the resulting rational surface is in general not developable but can be expressed as the envelop of a one-parameter set of rational developable surfaces. with three Bezier control lines.
