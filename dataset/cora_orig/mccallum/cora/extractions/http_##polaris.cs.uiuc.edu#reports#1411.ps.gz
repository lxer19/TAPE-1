Abstract: This paper presents a model reduction method for large-scale linear systems that is based on a Lanczos-type approach. A variant of the nonsymmetric Lanczos method, rational Lanczos, is shown to yield a rational interpolant (multi-point Pade approximant) for the large-scale system. An exact expression for the error in the interpolant is derived. Examples are utilized to demonstrate that the rational Lanczos method provides opportunities for significant improvements in the rate of convergence over single-point Lanczos approaches.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper explores the use of Lanczos techniques for the reduced-order modeling of large-scale dynamical systems. A need for such reduced-order models arises in various areas of engineering such as the control of large flexible space structures [5] and the simulation of high speed circuits <ref> [6] </ref>. The system to be modeled is typically defined via a set of state space equations E _x (t) = Ax (t) + bu (t) and y (t) = c T x (t) + du (t) (1) where for simplicity, the direct-coupling term, d, will be assumed to be zero. <p> To overcome this difficulty, several papers in the areas of control and circuits explore the use of a multi-point Pade approximant (denoted a rational interpolant in the systems literature) for approximating (1) (see for example <ref> [6, 15, 17, 30] </ref>). In rational interpolation [1] (multi-point Pade [2]), a reduced-order model is constructed whose transfer function ^g (s) interpolates the value and subsequent derivatives of g (s) at multiple frequencies f 1 ; 2 ; : : : ; -g. <p> Properties of Pade approximation and the Lanczos algorithm are combined in this section to indicate why the frequency response of a Lanczos-generated model tends to be only locally accurate about for reasonably small values of k.

Reference-contexts: The reduced-order model is computed so that its transfer function ^g (s) shares (matches) certain attributes of the original transfer function g (s). The Lanczos method is known to be a preferred numerical approach for computing such a model <ref> [7, 10] </ref>. Additionally, Lanczos-type methods only involve multiplication by A and E and/or solving linear equations involving A and E.

The approach of <ref> [7] </ref> is a special case of the rational Lanczos method where only one interpolation point is allowed. The earlier methods of [4, 19, 25] are an even more specialized case of the rational Lanczos approach where only an interpolation point at zero is permitted.

Reference-contexts: We stress that such assumptions are met by large-scale problems arising from most applications. However, most existing model reduction techniques (e.g., balanced truncations and Hankel norm optimal approximations) <ref> [8] </ref> fail to take advantage of any sparsity or structure in the system matrix and are thus typically impractical for large-scale problems. fl This work has been supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grants CCR-9120105 and CCR-9209349.

Reference-contexts: A surprising benefit of this last fact is that the rational Lanczos method is driven to avoid the numerical instabilities present in the standard Lanczos method. Meaningful system theory in rational Lanczos can replace the nonintuitive, complex fixes of the standard Lanczos method (e.g., look-ahead <ref> [9, 20] </ref>). This paper begins in x2 by describing moment matching, the Lanczos method and the connections between the two. An emphasis is placed on defining the terminology associated with both moment matching and the Lanczos method in a unified and unambiguous way. <p> A large amount of effort has been placed towards working around this breakdown in the standard non-symmetric Lanczos algorithm, e.g., the look-ahead Lanczos method <ref> [9, 20] </ref>. The serious breakdown itself is known to be connected with system theory [21]. For example, if r T k+1 q k+1 = 0, the order-k and order-k + 1 models of the single-point Lanczos method would share the same minimal realization.

Additionally, Lanczos-type methods only involve multiplication by A and E and/or solving linear equations involving A and E.

It is stressed once more that a Lanczos-type method is desired to avoid the numerical difficulties encountered in previous explicit moment matching methods <ref> [10] </ref>. To simplify the development of rational Lanczos, we assume in this section that a fixed number of moments (2|) are to be matched about each interpolation point. This restriction is not conducive to model reduction however and will be dropped in x5.

The loss of biorthogonality between V k and W k is well-known <ref> [12] </ref> and complete fixes (e.g., complete reorthogonalization) are expensive.

Reference-contexts: The Lanczos-based approaches are in fact connected to well-known approximations of (1) including partial realizations and/or Pade approximants <ref> [13, 27] </ref>. These approximations are centered on the transfer functions g (s) y (s)=u (s) = c T (sE A) 1 b and ^g (s) ^y (s)=^u (s) = ^c T (s ^ E ^ A) 1 ^ b which arise out of Laplace transforms of (1) and (2) respectively. <p> The resulting model, ^ A = T k = W T k AV k , ^ b = W T ^c = V T k c, is a partial realization of the original system <ref> [13] </ref>. However, as noted in x2.1, k must typically grow large before a sufficiently accurate partial realization is acquired. The use of shifts does not help here.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, Lanczos-type methods only involve multiplication by A and E and/or solving linear equations involving A and E. Thus one can take advantage of the structure of these matrices. Avenues also exist in the Lanczos method for removing the spurious, unstable poles which may appear in the approximation <ref> [14] </ref>. Unfortunately, model reduction methods such as partial realization and Pade approximation are not acceptable in all applications. Such approximations tend to converge in a local fashion about a single frequency s = 2 C.

The serious breakdown itself is known to be connected with system theory [21]. <p> breakdown <ref> [21] </ref> as it leads to division by zero in the algorithm. A large amount of effort has been placed towards working around this breakdown in the standard non-symmetric Lanczos algorithm, e.g., the look-ahead Lanczos method [9, 20]. The serious breakdown itself is known to be connected with system theory [21]. For example, if r T k+1 q k+1 = 0, the order-k and order-k + 1 models of the single-point Lanczos method would share the same minimal realization. This fact is entirely consistent with Theorem 3.

The rational Lanczos algorithm 12 is not restricted to real i . For example, one might combine Algorithm 2 and the methods of <ref> [24] </ref> to arrive at a complex interpolation point, rational Lanczos method. The selection and implementation of complex interpolation points will be discussed in a forthcoming paper. Besides placing the interpolation points, one must also be concerned with how many moments are to be matched about each of these points.

Reference-contexts: The Lanczos-based approaches are in fact connected to well-known approximations of (1) including partial realizations and/or Pade approximants <ref> [13, 27] </ref>. These approximations are centered on the transfer functions g (s) y (s)=u (s) = c T (sE A) 1 b and ^g (s) ^y (s)=^u (s) = ^c T (s ^ E ^ A) 1 ^ b which arise out of Laplace transforms of (1) and (2) respectively. <p> : ; k1 r 0 g and K k ( T ; q 0 ) = spanfq 0 ; T q 0 ; : : :; k1 T q 0 g: It is the construction and use of these two Krylov subspaces which connects the Lanczos method to moment matching <ref> [27] </ref>.

Although this choice of still fits the notation of Algorithm 1, it differs in a significant computational way from the commonly assumed choice of = A.

This result is given in the following theorem.

Reference-contexts: To overcome this difficulty, several papers in the areas of control and circuits explore the use of a multi-point Pade approximant (denoted a rational interpolant in the systems literature) for approximating (1) (see for example <ref> [6, 15, 17, 30] </ref>). In rational interpolation [1] (multi-point Pade [2]), a reduced-order model is constructed whose transfer function ^g (s) interpolates the value and subsequent derivatives of g (s) at multiple frequencies f 1 ; 2 ; : : : ; -g. <p> And in this example, even an optimal single-point interpolation falls short of a multi-point Pade approximation which will be generated in x5. 4 Rational Lanczos algorithm To avoid the difficulties inherent to single-point interpolation, one can turn to model reduction via multi-point Pade approximation <ref> [15, 30] </ref>.
