Reference-contexts: At the Surgical Planning Lab (SPL) of Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), Shenton et al. use segmented temporal lobes from magnetic resonance brain scans for studying the relationship of schizophrenia to volumetric changes in the region <ref> [2] </ref>. At University of Southern California, Sandor et. al require a segmentation of the intra-cranial cavity in order to produce a labeling for the cortex [3]. <p> We are currently working with gradient echo images acquired using a General Electric Signa 1.5 Tesla clinical MR imager. The voxel size is 1 mm x 1 mm x 1.5 mm, and there are 256 x 256 x 124 voxels per data set (see <ref> [2] </ref> for details). 32 The signal at each voxel represents the aggregate response of the corresponding 1:5mm 3 volume in the patient's head. <p> Recently our segmenter has gained usage in two volumetric studies underway at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital: one is a Schizophrenia study that examines the white matter and grey matter content in the cerebellum, <ref> [2] </ref>, and the other is a study of the change in brain composition in newborns [25]. For the Schizophrenia study, we had available to us manual segmentations for 20 scans, against which we compare our results and present some quantifications of our performance in Section 4.3.1. <p> Of these, we have manual segmentations for 20 cases that are being used in a Schizophrenia study <ref> [2] </ref> (the rest were only performed using our system sisince manual segmentation for each case can take upto 6 expert-hours) against which we compared our results.

[16] does use a similar semi-automatic approach in 3D to segment the brain from T1 and T2 weighted MR images. Sandor and Leahy use 3D morphology and connectivity to mark the various sulci in the cortex in isolated brains from MR images <ref> [3] </ref>. In a similar vein, O'brien et al. at Georgia Tech detect coronary vessels in Angiographic image sequences (X-ray) using operations such as region growing and skeletonization [31].

Reference-contexts: While the human visual system easily com-pensates for this field, the gain can perturb the intensity distributions, causing them to overlap significantly and thus lead to substantial misclassification in traditional intensity based classification methods (e.g. <ref> [7] </ref>). (See Figure 2-1 for histograms of the intensity distribution in the head in an MR scan, and of the intensity distribution in segmented brain from the same scan.

Reference-contexts: complete head histogram shows that the the intensities for the brain neither form distinct peaks in the histogram, nor are clearly separated from the rest of the structures in the head in any other way, which are the two criteria that traditional intensity based segmentation relies on.) Wells et al. <ref> [8] </ref> introduced a powerful statistical method that uses knowledge of tissue properties and RF coil inhomogeneity to correct for the spatial distortion in the signal. The method, EM segmentation, produces simultaneous classification of tissue classes and estimation of the gain field due to inhomogeneities in the RF coil in MRI. <p> The method, EM segmentation, produces simultaneous classification of tissue classes and estimation of the gain field due to inhomogeneities in the RF coil in MRI. The following is a description of the details of the method presented in the same words as [9] and <ref> [8] </ref>. Intra- and inter-scan MRI intensity inhomogeneities are modeled with a spatially-varying factor called the gain field that multiplies the intensity data. The application of a logarithmic transformation to the intensities allows the artifact to be modeled as an additive bias field. <p> We use a single channel, non-parametric, multi-class implementation of the segmenter that is described in <ref> [8] </ref>. Training points are used for white matter, grey matter, csf and skin, and therefore the resultant tissue classifications correspond to these four classes. The output of this stage is a set of classified voxels. <p> Approximations to the true boundary can be obtained in the form of manual segmentation by experts of neuroanatomy, but experiments have shown that there can be up to 15% variations in classifications generated by different experts [15] <ref> [8] </ref>. We could test our method on synthetic images, but it is difficult to generate synthetic images that capture the complexity and deformability of the human head. We could test our method on a phantom brain, but we are not aware of the existence of one. <p> that have been typically used for validation of segmentation algorithms, their strengths and weaknesses, and then present our results based on the validation scheme that we have chosen. 52 # Segmentation Task Strengths Weaknesses 1 Brain Tissue [14] & Cardiac Vas culature [21] Simple Subjective 2 White and Grey Matter <ref> [8] </ref>, [16], [15] Less Subjective 15% variation in manual seg mentations & Labor Intensive 3 White and Grey Matter [8], Cardiac Walls & Corpus Callosum [22] Scientific Approach Not Sufficient in all applica tions 4 Cardiac Motion [23] Reliable Invasive 5 Brain Tissue [24] Reliable Labor Intensive Table 4.1: Strengths and <p> based on the validation scheme that we have chosen. 52 # Segmentation Task Strengths Weaknesses 1 Brain Tissue [14] & Cardiac Vas culature [21] Simple Subjective 2 White and Grey Matter <ref> [8] </ref>, [16], [15] Less Subjective 15% variation in manual seg mentations & Labor Intensive 3 White and Grey Matter [8], Cardiac Walls & Corpus Callosum [22] Scientific Approach Not Sufficient in all applica tions 4 Cardiac Motion [23] Reliable Invasive 5 Brain Tissue [24] Reliable Labor Intensive Table 4.1: Strengths and Weaknesses of Validation Methods 4.2 Validation Methods We have considered five types of schemes that have been proposed by <p> effect of the erosion, and therefore the resultant object boundaries will be distorted. 6.3 Statistical Methods Maximum likelihood, Bayesian decision theory, and principal component analysis have been used for intensity based as well as location based segmentation of medical imagery as illustrated below. 6.3.1 Example Application Systems Wells et al. <ref> [8] </ref> present a powerful method for simultaneous classification of tissue classes and estimation of the gain field due to inhomogeneities in the RF coil in MRI.

Reference-contexts: The method, EM segmentation, produces simultaneous classification of tissue classes and estimation of the gain field due to inhomogeneities in the RF coil in MRI. The following is a description of the details of the method presented in the same words as <ref> [9] </ref> and [8]. Intra- and inter-scan MRI intensity inhomogeneities are modeled with a spatially-varying factor called the gain field that multiplies the intensity data. The application of a logarithmic transformation to the intensities allows the artifact to be modeled as an additive bias field. <p> The nfin covariance matrix for the entire bias field is denoted fi . Although fi is too large to manipulate directly in practice, it is shown in <ref> [9] </ref> that tractable estimators result when fi is chosen so that its inverse is banded. Having a banded inverse implies that only the relationship between nearby bias components contributes to the probability, while more distant bias values are independent of one another. <p> These filters have a low computational cost that is independent of the width of their support (amount of smoothing). That the optimal H is a linear low-pass filter, when tissue class is constant is argued in <ref> [9] </ref>. This method has been used to successfully segment 1000 scans in a multiple scle rosis study without manual intervention, which makes it the most aggressively tested 24 intensity based classifier around. Figure 2-2 shows the results of the EM segmenter on a sagittal section obtained using a surface coil.

Reference-contexts: Also known as active contour models, these provide a method for minimizing an objective function to obtain a contour of interest, especially if an approximate location of the contour is available. In this section, we present some background on two of the earlier deformable contour models: snakes <ref> [12] </ref> and balloons [13] in order to familiarize the reader with the essential components of such models. 27 28 Snakes A deformable contour is a planar curve which has an initial position and an objective function associated with it. <p> A special class of deformable contours called snakes was introduced by Witkin, Kass and Terzopoulos <ref> [12] </ref> in which the initial position is specified interactively by the user and the objective function is referred to as the energy of the snake. By analogy to physical systems, the snake slithers to minimize its energy over time. <p> we need a more specific model than snakes for our application is that the boundary of the brain is surrounded by points of high brightness gradient (the surrounding matter being soft tissue of the neck or the meninges), which makes insufficient the use of any of the functions suggested in <ref> [12] </ref> as the external energy terms of the evolution equation. 43 On Balloons The balloon model, with its normal force which allows the initial position to be inside or outside the intended contour, came closer to our requirement, but needed further customization, since it treats the direction of the normal force

Reference-contexts: In this section, we present some background on two of the earlier deformable contour models: snakes [12] and balloons <ref> [13] </ref> in order to familiarize the reader with the essential components of such models. 27 28 Snakes A deformable contour is a planar curve which has an initial position and an objective function associated with it. <p> As dv dt tends to zero, we get a solution to the system Av = F . Formulating this evolution problem using finite differences with time step t , we obtain a system of the form <ref> [13] </ref>: (I + t A)v t = v t1 + t F (v t1 ) ; where v t denotes the position vector of the snake at time t, and I is the identity matrix. <p> This normalization of the external force, along with careful selection of the magnitude of k, constrains the motion of each point on the contour to at most one pixel per iteration. This avoids instabilities due to time discretization, and is discussed in detail in <ref> [13] </ref>. Contrasting the Balloon and Snake models, we note that incorporation of the normal force in the balloon model allows the initial position of the contour to be further from the intended final position, while still enabling convergence.

The three categories are: deformable models based methods, statistical methods, and morphology based methods.

They interactively initialize this model in the data and iterate it in conjunction with morphology based image forces to segment the brain from MRPAGE data.

Reference-contexts: segmenter has gained usage in two volumetric studies underway at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital: one is a Schizophrenia study that examines the white matter and grey matter content in the cerebellum, [2], and the other is a study of the change in brain composition in newborns <ref> [25] </ref>. For the Schizophrenia study, we had available to us manual segmentations for 20 scans, against which we compare our results and present some quantifications of our performance in Section 4.3.1. <p> Figures 4-8 show two views of a patient with subdural haematoma as well as a tumor. 4.3.4 NewBorn Study We have segmented brains for a quantitative study of brain development in preterm infants by Huppi et al. <ref> [25] </ref>. In order to examine brain composition, MR scans of 14 preterm infants of different gestational age were used, and our segmenter was used to define the total brain volume, as well as percentages of csf, unmyelinated and myelinated white matter, and total grey matter.

Reference-contexts: They report a need for data acquisition at 30fps or more for the algorithm to perform satisfactorily. Poon et al. at the University of Technology, Sydney, Australia detect cervical carcinoma and ventricles from MR images using a snake approach that incorporates region information as well <ref> [26] </ref>. The number of regions in the image and a topologically correct initialization of contours is provided interactively. A region based image energy term is created that minimizes gray level variance within regions and maximizes it between regions.

Reference-contexts: The new location is generated randomly, but the maximum displacement is adapted to the cooling schedule to allow large scale modifications at high temperatures and small scale modifications at low temperatures. As is characteristic of most simulated annealing implementations, this one is computationally intensive. Syn et al. <ref> [27] </ref> use a more efficient simulated annealing by reformulating the snake forces as Gibbs functions. This defines a Markov dependency over adjacent control point triplets, allowing the use of simulated annealing to optimize over a search range 77 defined on both sides of the initial contour.

Reference-contexts: This defines a Markov dependency over adjacent control point triplets, allowing the use of simulated annealing to optimize over a search range 77 defined on both sides of the initial contour. Grzeszczuk and Levin present a stochas-tic deformation method for segmentation <ref> [28] </ref> in which image forces are derived from the statistical properties of previously segmented images, and simulated annealing is used to find the globally optimal contour of interest.

Reference-contexts: Also noteworthy is the addition of region based information into this framework by Chakraborty et al. [22]. Gindi et al. use "atlas based snakes" to segment the putamen, a low contrast mid-brain structure from T1 weighted MR images <ref> [30] </ref>. The explicit "atlas" is a normal data set in which locations of some landmarks as well as the boundary of the putamen 78 have been marked manually. For a given data set, the segmentation consists of two steps.

Reference-contexts: This method has been used to successfully segment 1000 scans in a multiple sclerosis study without manual intervention, which makes it the most aggressively tested intensity based classifier around. A different statistical approach is illustrated in the atlas based segmentation method of Evans et al. at McGill University, Montreal <ref> [32] </ref>. They have constructed an average brain volume by registering over 300 normal brains in Tailarach space, and then averaging the voxels independently.
