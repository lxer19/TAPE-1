Abstract: In multi-access wireless systems, dynamic allocation of resources such as transmit power, bandwidths and rates is an important means to deal with the time-varying nature of the environment. In this two-part paper, we consider the problem of optimal resource allocation from an information theoretic point of view. We focus on the multi-access fading channel with Gaussian noise, and define two notions of capacity depending on whether the traffic is delay-sensitive or not. In part I, we characterize the throughput capacity region which contain the long-term achievable rates through the time-varying channel. We show that each point on the boundary of the region can be achieved by successive decoding. Moreover, the optimal rate and power allocations in each fading state can be explicitly obtained in a greedy manner. The solution can be viewed as the generalization of the water-pouring construction for single user channels to multi-access channels with arbitrary number of users, and exploits the underlying polymatroid structure of the capacity region. In part II, we characterize a delay-limited capacity region and obtained analogous results.

The characterization of the capacity region of the multi-access memo-ryless channel with probability transitions p (yjx 1 ; : : : ; x M ) is well-known (Ahlswede <ref> [1] </ref>, Liao [13]); it is the set of all rate vectors R satisfying: R (S) I [Y ; (X i ) i2S j (X i ) i62S ] 8S f1; : : : ; M g for some independent input distribution p (x 1 )p (x 2 ) : : :

Reference-contexts: In a related work, Cheng and Verdu <ref> [2] </ref> obtained an explicit characterization of the capacity region of the two-user time-invariant multi-access Gaussian channel with inter-symbol interference. <p> In this case, the channel is given by: Y (n) = i=1 k This is the Gaussian multi-access channel with inter-symbol interference (ISI), and a characterization of the capacity region has been obtained by Cheng and Verdu <ref> [2] </ref>. Let ^ H i (f) be the Fourier transform of the channel. Let P be a power allocation policy such that for user i and frequency f , P i (f) can be interpreted as the transmitter power that user i allocates at frequency f . <p> Let F = fP : 2 2 be the set of all feasible power allocation policy. Then the capacity region of the channel is P2F Z W W log (1 + i2S P i (f)j ^ H i (f)j 2 where 2 = 0 W . In <ref> [2] </ref>, an explicit characterization of the region and the optimal power allocations are obtained for the two-user case. We shall now give the solution in the general multi-user case, which follows almost directly from the results in Section 3.

Reference-contexts: The optimal power allocation is obtained via water-filling over the fading states. Knopp and Humblet [14] have solved the multi-user version of that problem for the special case of symmetric users with equal rate requirements. (A similar result was also presented later in <ref> [3] </ref>.) Our results on computing the entire throughput capacity region of the multi-access fading channel and the associated optimal power allocation can be viewed as the analogue of the classic water-filling solution in the multi-user setting.

Reference-contexts: Polymatroid structure has been used successfully in many resource allocation problems to obtain greedy optimization algorithms (see for example <ref> [5] </ref>.) In this paper, we will show that the multi-access Gaussian capacity region in fact belongs to a special class of generalized symmetric polymatroids , and we derive new greedy solutions to various optimization problems for this class of polymatroids. <p> Again we make use of the polymatroid structure and the solution will have a greedy flavor. To make further progress, we now identify further structure in the time-invariant multi-access Gaussian capacity region C g (h; P). Definition 3.11 (see <ref> [5] </ref>) The rank function f of a polymatroid B (f ) is generalized symmetric if there exists a vector y 2 &lt; M + and a non-decreasing concave function g such that f (S) = g (y (S)) for every S E.

Reference-contexts: When the receiver can perfectly track the channel but the transmitters have no such information, the codewords cannot be chosen as a function of the state of the channel but the decoding can make use of such information. For this scenario, the capacity region is known (Gallager <ref> [7] </ref>, Shamai and Wyner [17]) and is given by: f (R 1 ; : : : ; R M ) : R (S) E H [ 2 P 2 ]; 8S f1; : : : ; M gg (3) where H = (H 1 ; : : : ; H M <p> A rigorous proof of this result can be found in [17]. An intuitive understanding of this result can be obtained by viewing capacities in terms of time averages of mutual information (Gallager <ref> [7] </ref>), the rate of flow of which can be viewed as a random process depending on the fading levels of the users. <p> However, if we make the assumptions that the channel varies very slowly relative to the multipath delay spread and that the time variations are random and ergodic , then the capacity region for that case is given by <ref> [7] </ref>: fR : R (S) E 2 2 P 2 )df 8S f1; : : : ; M gg where P i is the average power constraint of user i. <p> The expectation is taken over all (joint) fading states. How valid is this assumption in practice? We use here a numerical example in <ref> [7] </ref>. Consider a typical mobile scenario where the vehicle is moving at 60 km/h and the center frequency of the transmission bandwidth is 1 GHz.

Reference-contexts: The notion of delay-limited capacity was introduced in [12] which obtained results in the symmetric case. The delay-limited power allocation schemes are similar in flavor to those considered in the CDMA power control literature (see for example <ref> [11] </ref>, [19]), where the goal is to maintain a desired signal-to-noise ratio at all fading states. However, those works consider only decoding schemes where a user is decoded treating other users as interference, which is sub-optimal from an information-theoretic point of view. <p> fading state, the greedy algorithm computes the optimal rate and power allocation using the current power prices; at a slower time-scale, the power prices are adjusted to meet the average power constraints. 23 The iterative algorithm has the same monotonicity property as other power control algorithms in the literature (Hanly <ref> [11] </ref>, Yates [19]). In the references quoted, users directly control their access to the "available capacity" by updating their transmit powers. Monotonicity arises from the fact that if a user increases power, this decreases the rates of all other users, causing them to increase power.

Reference-contexts: We conclude that (n) ! fl . 2 Algorithm 4.2 has all the users updating (n) simultaneously. However, convergence still occurs if users update one at a time, or even asynchronously under certain weak conditions (Mitra <ref> [16] </ref>). An advantage of this is that then users do not need to know the fading statistics. If i is being updated, for example, then binary search can be used to find the new value that achieves P i for user i.

Reference-contexts: In this example, it is 0:018s. Typical delay spread between paths range from 10 7 to 1:5fi10 5 s <ref> [18] </ref>. Hence, the time variation due to fast fading is significantly slower than the delay spread. This is even more so when the users are moving at a slower speed. Thus, we see that the assumption is quite reasonable for typical wireless situations.
