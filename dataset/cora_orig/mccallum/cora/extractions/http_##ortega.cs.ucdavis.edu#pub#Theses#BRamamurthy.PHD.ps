Reference-contexts: Optical fiber has emerged as an excellent medium for such future networks in view of its tremendous bandwidth potential (around 50 THz). It is already being used as a transmission medium of choice by several telecommunications companies in the United States and abroad <ref> [1, 16] </ref>. Apart from its huge bandwidth capability, optical fiber also offers a low attenuation loss (roughly 0.2 dB/km between 1200 nm and 1600 nm wavelengths) and extremely low bit-error rates, making it ideally suited for long-haul communications.

Reference-contexts: Each "non-reflective star" consists of pairs of inputs and outputs, and each output carries all of the wavelengths that were incident on all of the inputs except for the wavelengths that were carried on its own paired input, as in the Level-0 All-Optical Network (AON) <ref> [3] </ref>. In a k fi k star, the power on each wavelength on an input fiber is directed to the other k 1 output fibers and divided evenly among them. This is referred to as the splitting loss at a star. <p> Chapter 3: Amplifier Placement The Unequally-Powered-Wavelengths Case 36 carried on its own paired input (see Fig. 3.2 for an example).

Reference-contexts: However, it is assumed that the random variables representing the number of idle wavelengths on different links are independent. The model obtained is computationally intensive and is tractable only for densely-connected networks with a few nodes. The model described in <ref> [9] </ref> makes more simplistic traffic assumptions to avoid the recursive numerical evaluations required in the other models. However, it correctly predicts some unobvious qualitative behavior demonstrated in simulation studies. Below, we describe these approaches in detail. <p> The blocking probability of the lightpaths is used to study the performance of the Chapter 4: Wavelength Conversion in WDM Networking 75 Kovacevic et al.

The link-loads are not assumed to be independent; however, the assumption is retained that a wavelength is used on successive links independent of other wavelengths. <p> The gain is found to be directly proportional to the effective path length (H=L). A larger switch size () tends to increase the blocking probability in networks without wavelength conversion. The model used in <ref> [9] </ref> is also applicable to ring networks, unlike the work in [48], and it correctly predicts the low gain in utilizing wavelength conversion in ring networks.

Details: The simplified model described initially in [9] is based on standard series independent link assumptions, i.e., a lightpath request sees a network in which a wavelength's usage on a fiber link is statistically independent of other fiber links and other wavelengths. However, this model generally tends to over-estimate the blocking probability 4 . <p> Next, let us consider a network without wavelength converters. The probability P b that the connection request from A to B will be blocked equals the probability that, along this 4 The link-load independence assumption is relaxed later on in <ref> [9] </ref> to provide a more accurate model. <p> From Eqns. (4.16) and (4.18), after setting P b = P 0 b , we get 1=W ln (1 P b ) where the approximation holds for small P b , large H, and moderate W so that P 1=W too close to unity. It is also reported in <ref> [9] </ref> that the gain increases as the blocking probability decreases, but this effect is small for small values of P b . Also, as W increases, G also increases until it peaks around W 10 (for q 0:5), and the maximum gain is close to H=2. <p> While this was a simple analysis to study the effects of hop length, a more rigorous treatment incorporating the load dependencies on successive links in a path is also presented in <ref> [9] </ref>. 4.4.2 Related Work on Gain Characterization In this section, we present other significant works which characterize the gain available from networks with wavelength converters. <p> Multi-fiber networks [46] The benefits of wavelength conversion in a network with multiple fiber links are studied in [46], by extending the analysis presented in <ref> [9] </ref> to multi-fiber networks. Multi-fiber links are found to reduce the gain obtained due to wavelength conversion, and the number of fibers is found to be more important than the number of wavelengths for a network. <p> The model used in this work captures the functionality of certain all-optical wavelength converters (e.g., those based on four-wave mixing) whose conversion efficiency drops with increasing range. The analytical model follows from <ref> [9] </ref> but employs both link-load independence and wavelength-independence assumptions. The results obtained indicate that a significant improvement in the blocking performance of the network is obtained when limited-range wavelength converters with as little as one quarter of the full range are used. <p> In previous work on the RWA problem, e.g., <ref> [6, 9, 19, 74] </ref>, the network blocking has been estimated using analytical and simulation approaches under the assumption of an ideal physical layer that causes no impairment to a transmitted signal.

Multiple wavelength division multiplexed channels can be operated on a single fiber simultaneously; however, a fundamental requirement in fiber-optic communication is that these channels operate at different wavelengths.

The XGM scheme gives a wavelength-converted signal that is inverted compared to the input signal.

Reference-contexts: The main differences between the models are highlighted in Table 4.1. The model described in <ref> [48] </ref> assumes that the loads on different links in the network are independent and that the busy wavelengths on different links are allocated independent of one another. The model presented in [86] incorporates the link-load dependencies using a Markov correlation method and predicts closely the behavior of an arbitrary network. <p> The model described in [9] makes more simplistic traffic assumptions to avoid the recursive numerical evaluations required in the other models. However, it correctly predicts some unobvious qualitative behavior demonstrated in simulation studies. Below, we describe these approaches in detail. A probabilistic model with independent link-load assumption <ref> [48] </ref> Overview: An approximate analytical model is developed for a fixed-path (deterministic) routed network with an arbitrary topology, both with and without wavelength conversion. <p> The blocking probability of the lightpaths is used to study the performance of the Chapter 4: Wavelength Conversion in WDM Networking 75 Kovacevic et al.

In this case, a connection request is blocked when there is no wavelength available on every link of the path. The approach in <ref> [48] </ref> determines the conditional probability that k wavelengths are available for a connection on a two-hop path and extends the analysis for an n-hop path. <p> Thus, the arrivals on the link can be considered to be Poisson arrivals, and the number of occupied wavelengths can be represented by the distribution given in Eqn. (4.1). However, to make the analysis of the network without wavelength conversion tractable, the approach in <ref> [48] </ref> makes an approximation by assuming Poisson arrivals at the links in this case also. The network blocking probabilities can be obtained by solving the set of coupled nonlinear equations called Erlang's map. <p> The 3 Networks without wavelength conversion and those with full wavelength conversion are handled as extreme cases under the same framework of sparse conversion. Chapter 4: Wavelength Conversion in WDM Networking 78 model improves on the one in <ref> [48] </ref> by relaxing the independence assumptions on the loads and wavelength-occupancy probabilities of the links. The authors find that the usefulness of wavelength converters depends on the connectivity of the network. <p> A probabilistic model without independent link load assumption [9] Chapter 4: Wavelength Conversion in WDM Networking 81 Overview: A model which is more analytically tractable than the ones in <ref> [11, 48] </ref> is provided in [9]; however, it uses more simplistic traffic assumptions. The link-loads are not assumed to be independent; however, the assumption is retained that a wavelength is used on successive links independent of other wavelengths. <p> The gain is found to be directly proportional to the effective path length (H=L). A larger switch size () tends to increase the blocking probability in networks without wavelength conversion. The model used in [9] is also applicable to ring networks, unlike the work in <ref> [48] </ref>, and it correctly predicts the low gain in utilizing wavelength conversion in ring networks.

Reference-contexts: A possible architecture of such a wavelength-convertible switching node is the dedicated wavelength-convertible switch (see Fig. 4.9, from <ref> [53] </ref>). In this architecture, each wavelength along each output link in a switch has a dedicated wavelength converter, i.e., an M fi M switch in an N -wavelength system requires M fi N converters. <p> However, the dedicated wavelength-convertible switch is not very cost-efficient since all of the wavelength converters may not be required all the time [42]. An effective method to cut costs is to share the converters. Two architectures have been proposed for switches sharing converters <ref> [53] </ref>. <p> When opto-electronic wavelength conversion is used, the functionality of the wavelength converter can be performed at the access stations instead of at the switches. The share-with-local switch architecture proposed in <ref> [53] </ref> (see Fig. 4.11) and the simplified network access Chapter 4: Wavelength Conversion in WDM Networking 69 Chapter 4: Wavelength Conversion in WDM Networking 70 station architecture proposed in [49] (see Fig. 4.12) fall under this category. 4.3 Network Design, Control, and Management Issues 4.3.1 Network Design Network designs must evolve <p> Designs of switch architectures have been proposed (see Section 4.2.2) which allow sharing of converters among the various signals at a switch. It has been shown in <ref> [53] </ref> that the performance of such a network saturates when the number of converters at a switch increases beyond a certain threshold. An interesting problem is to quantify the dependence of this threshold on the routing algorithm used and the blocking probability desired. 3. <p> This is the wavelength-continuity constraint described in Section 4.1. This routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem, or variants of it, has been studied earlier [5, 8, 19] for networks without wavelength conversion. Dynamic routing algorithms have been proposed for use in a wavelength-convertible network <ref> [18, 53] </ref>. Algorithms have also been studied which use a fixed path or deterministic routing [74]. In such a scheme, there is a fixed path between every source-destination pair in the network. <p> range deliver almost all of the performance improvement offered by an ideal full-range converter. "Minimal" wavelength conversion in WDM rings [7] In addition to reducing the overall blocking probability, wavelength converters can improve the fairness performance by allowing many long-distance lightpaths, which would have been blocked otherwise, to be established <ref> [53] </ref>. In [7], the authors define the Unfairness Factor as the ratio of the average blocking on the longest path to the blocking on the shortest path. The Fairness Ratio is then defined as the ratio of the Unfairness Factor without wavelength conversion to that with wavelength conversion.

Reference-contexts: In a WDM network, signals originate at nodes which are located far away from one another and, hence, the power levels of these signals at the input of an amplifier or a receiver could vary widely. This is called the near-far effect <ref> [54] </ref>. Under such conditions, a signal with high optical power could saturate the gain of the amplifier and limit the gain available for the remaining signals. <p> Even in the absence of unequal spectral gain, the near-far effect results in a wide dynamic range in the optical powers of the signals at the receivers, resulting in potential loss of data. Amplifier-placement algorithms have been proposed <ref> [54] </ref> which avoid this problem by equalizing the power levels of all the signals at any point in the network, using a local link-by-link method. <p> Numerical examples show that this global optimization method can result in a significant savings in the number of amplifiers over the link-by-link approach in <ref> [54] </ref>. An improved version of the gain saturation model for the amplifier used in [54] is employed here. This chapter is due to be published in the September 1998 isssue of the IEEE/OSA Journal of Lightwave Technology [70]. <p> Numerical examples show that this global optimization method can result in a significant savings in the number of amplifiers over the link-by-link approach in <ref> [54] </ref>.

This chapter is due to be published in the September 1998 isssue of the IEEE/OSA Journal of Lightwave Technology [70]. Both the previous optical amplifier-placement schemes <ref> [54, 70] </ref> discussed above restricted all of the wavelengths at any given point in a fiber to operate at the same power level. <p> In Chapter 3, we propose a scheme that minimizes the number of amplifiers for the network setting described in <ref> [54] </ref> without the restriction that wavelengths in the same fiber be at the same power level. The method generates a set of constraints to accurately describe the problem setting, which turns out to be a nonlinear program. The solution is obtained with a nonlinear solver using efficient search algorithms. <p> Illustrative examples on sample networks are presented, which demonstrate the characteristics and the advantages of our optimal amplifier-placement algorithm. 2.1 Introduction Several architectures have been proposed for broadband optical local/metropolitan area networks and access networks <ref> [30, 41, 54, 81, 85, 88] </ref>. Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is used in such networks to support high-bandwidth applications. <p> The value of p sen can also be changed iteratively, after the placement of the amplifiers, in order to obtain the desired bit-error rate (BER) at each of the receivers, following the approach in <ref> [54] </ref>. Thus, in this study, we do not consider system factors such as amplifier ASE noise and crosstalk at the receivers, explicitly; these factors are assumed to be implicitly incorporated in the parameter p sen . <p> These problems can be bypassed by restricting all of the wavelengths at any given point in a fiber to be at the same power level. In previous work <ref> [54] </ref>, the amplifier-placement scheme operated on a link-by-link basis by maintaining the power level of all the wavelengths at the output of each star at the lowest possible value (i.e., the receiver-sensitivity level, p sen ). <p> Numerical examples will show that this global optimization method can result in a significant savings in the number of amplifiers over the link-by-link approach in <ref> [54] </ref>. 2.1.2 Amplifier Gain Model Previous studies [54] used the gain model in Fig. 2.2. In this model, it is assumed that the full small-signal gain is realizable until the point at which the amplifier output becomes power-limited. <p> Numerical examples will show that this global optimization method can result in a significant savings in the number of amplifiers over the link-by-link approach in <ref> [54] </ref>. 2.1.2 Amplifier Gain Model Previous studies [54] used the gain model in Fig. 2.2. In this model, it is assumed that the full small-signal gain is realizable until the point at which the amplifier output becomes power-limited. At this point, the amplifier is assumed to enter saturation and the gain starts to drop. <p> At high input powers, the gain available at the amplifier is limited to the saturation output power, P max , as shown by the dashed lines in Fig. 2.3. The value of P max is retained as 1 mW (0 dBm) as in earlier work <ref> [54] </ref>, in order to facilitate comparison of the two amplifier-placement algorithms. Hence, the model used throughout this work, follows the solid line in Fig. 2.3 for low input powers and the dashed line for high input powers. <p> This is due to the fact that we employ only "passive" optical stars in the network, i.e., there is no scope for signal amplification within a star. As shown in <ref> [54] </ref>, we only need to ensure that the power level of each input signal on every input link to a star is high enough to guarantee that the signal exits the star on every output link at a power level of at least p sen . <p> A study on optimum amplifier location in spectrum-spliced WDM passive optical networks can be found in [15]. 2.2.6 Lower-Bound Analysis In this section, lower bounds on the number of amplifiers required for a given network to operate, using the link-by-link method (from <ref> [54] </ref>) and the global method (described in this work), are derived. Note that, while these lower bounds may not always be achievable, they help characterize the nature of the two methods. The link-by-link method in [54] forces the powers of all wavelengths to be equal to p sen at the beginning <p> number of amplifiers required for a given network to operate, using the link-by-link method (from <ref> [54] </ref>) and the global method (described in this work), are derived. Note that, while these lower bounds may not always be achievable, they help characterize the nature of the two methods. The link-by-link method in [54] forces the powers of all wavelengths to be equal to p sen at the beginning of all links originating at a star. The transmitter powers can be adjusted to avoid placing amplifiers on the links which originate at a station. <p> This is similar to the example network studied in <ref> [54] </ref> except that the size of group 3 has been decreased from 35 to 28 to make the network feasible for the values of P max = 0 dBm and p sen = 30 dBm. In this regard, note that the corresponding original example network in [54] was infeasible for its <p> example network studied in <ref> [54] </ref> except that the size of group 3 has been decreased from 35 to 28 to make the network feasible for the values of P max = 0 dBm and p sen = 30 dBm. In this regard, note that the corresponding original example network in [54] was infeasible for its choice of network parameters. The network has N = 63 stations and M = 4 passive stars. The number of amplifiers required using the algorithm in [54] is 79. The optimum number of amplifiers as obtained by our algorithms in Section 2.2 is 77. <p> In this regard, note that the corresponding original example network in <ref> [54] </ref> was infeasible for its choice of network parameters. The network has N = 63 stations and M = 4 passive stars. The number of amplifiers required using the algorithm in [54] is 79. The optimum number of amplifiers as obtained by our algorithms in Section 2.2 is 77. The difference in the number of amplifiers is not significant for this topology. <p> However, if we reduce the distance of the stations from the stars to 7.13 km, our global optimum method uses only 62 amplifiers against the 79 used by <ref> [54] </ref>, a 21% savings! This savings of these 15 amplifiers (from 77 to 62) occurs at the access links from star 3 to the stations in group 2. <p> The amplifier placement using the algorithm in <ref> [54] </ref> is shown in Fig. 2.11 and Table 2.4. 2.3.2 Results and Discussion We compare the number of amplifiers used by our global optimum algorithm vs. the number of amplifiers used by the link-by-link approach in [54] for three sample networks. <p> The amplifier placement using the algorithm in <ref> [54] </ref> is shown in Fig. 2.11 and Table 2.4. 2.3.2 Results and Discussion We compare the number of amplifiers used by our global optimum algorithm vs. the number of amplifiers used by the link-by-link approach in [54] for three sample networks. The networks are shown in Fig. 2.1, Fig. 2.9, and Fig. 2.10. Network 1 represents a feasible network adapted from the example used in [54].

We notice that our global optimum method performs much better than the link-by-link method in [54], especially for networks with short access links. We explain the difference below. The link-by-link method was designed to equalize the power levels of the wavelengths in the network, as opposed to trying to minimize the number of amplifiers in the network. <p> Finally, an amplifier-placement algorithm was run to determine the exact placement of the optical amplifiers. Numerical examples showed that this scheme has the potential to save a significant number of amplifiers over the scheme in <ref> [54] </ref>, which just attempted to perform power equalization. With optical amplifiers remaining very expensive, our scheme can significantly reduce network costs. We consider in Chapter 3 the problem of minimizing the number of amplifiers without the constraint on power equalization. <p> The value of p sen can also be changed iteratively, after the placement of the amplifiers, in order to obtain the desired bit-error rate (BER) at each of the receivers, following the approach in <ref> [54, 55] </ref>. <p> As we shall soon observe, allowing wavelengths to be at unequal powers eliminates the need for any amplifiers in this network. In this work, we propose a scheme that minimizes the number of amplifiers for the network setting described in <ref> [54] </ref> without the restriction that wavelengths in the same fiber be at the same power level. <p> Numerical examples will show that this network-wide optimization method without the equal-power constraint often results in solutions that require fewer amplifiers than the solutions in <ref> [54] </ref> and in Chapter 2. Chapter 3: Amplifier Placement The Unequally-Powered-Wavelengths Case 40 3.1.3 Amplifier Gain Model Currently, we employ a simplified model for the gain of a generic optical amplifier. <p> Our amplifier model has been designed into our solution as a generic gain module that can be easily replaced when a more accurate model for a specific amplifier is used. Previous studies <ref> [54] </ref> used the gain model in Fig. 3.5. In this model, it is assumed that the full small-signal gain of the amplifier is realizable until the point at which the amplifier output becomes power-limited. At this point, the amplifier is assumed to enter saturation and the gain starts to drop. <p> We use n l = dSG l =gmax l e, where is a small number to handle this situation ( = 0:01 in our numerical examples). Chapter 3: Amplifier Placement The Unequally-Powered-Wavelengths Case 51 3.3 Numerical Examples The link-by-link (LBL) method in <ref> [54] </ref> was designed to equalize the powers of the wavelengths in the network, as opposed to trying to minimize the number of amplifiers in the network. <p> = number of links, N = number of stations, and M = number of stars); thus, we obtain the lower bound of L N = 2 fi (N + M 1) N = N + 2 fi (M 1) on the number of amplifiers used by the LBL method in <ref> [54] </ref>. This algorithm performs the poorest, in comparison to other placement schemes, on networks that have short links because the other algorithms can usually avoid placing an amplifier on a short link simply by exiting the originating star with enough power to traverse the short link. <p> The lower bound on the number of amplifiers required using the Chapter 3: Amplifier Placement The Unequally-Powered-Wavelengths Case 52 Network Figure LBL LP NLP Lower CPU time Number method method method bound for NLP <ref> [54] </ref> (Chapter 2) (this work) [42] (this work) Simple 2 star 3.4 6 1 0 0 2s Tree 3.9 44 14 0 0 49s MAN 3.10 38 6 2 2 4h 6m 42s Scaled-up MAN 3.11 48 16 16 fl 14 10h 7m 42s Scaled-down MAN 3.12 38 4 0 0 <p> This network was designed in a semi-random fashion with some heuristics to guide the design. Table 3.2 shows that the new method was able to find a solution which required fewer amplifiers than the methods in <ref> [54] </ref> and in Chapter 2. Figure 3.10 also provides an insight into how the actual placements of amplifiers differ between the equally-powered-wavelengths method (LP) and the unequally-powered-wavelengths method (NLP). <p> The new method is not able to find a better solution than the equally-powered-wavelengths solution for the larger network in Fig. 3.11, even when it was given multiple feasible starting points (including the solutions found in <ref> [54] </ref> and in Chapter 2). Our method's solution is not guaranteed to be the best because it could have become stuck at a local minimum. If our new method is stuck at a local minimum, we potentially can miss the global minimum solution. <p> As Table 3.2 shows, the solver was unable to come up with a better solution than the LP solution, even when given multiple feasible starting points including the solutions found in <ref> [54] </ref> and in Chapter 2. The "denser-MAN" network in Fig. 3.13 differs from the MAN network in Fig. 3.10 in that there are 12 additional stations in it, 3 in each of the four groups of stations. <p> Note that, due to the characteristics of our NLP solution process, no polynomial-form time complexity can be specified. 9 The number of nodes for group 3 was reduced from 35 to 28 nodes because the original network, as proposed in <ref> [54] </ref>, was infeasible because signals exited the star of degree 35 with power below p sen = 30 dBm. Chapter 3: Amplifier Placement The Unequally-Powered-Wavelengths Case 58 3.4 Summary We considered the problem of minimizing the number of optical amplifiers in an optical LAN/MAN. <p> Finally, an amplifier-placement algorithm was run to determine the exact placement of the optical amplifiers. Numerical examples showed that this scheme has the potential to save a significant number of amplifiers over the scheme in <ref> [54] </ref>, which just attempted to perform power equalization. With optical amplifiers remaining very expensive, our scheme can significantly reduce network costs. In Chapter 3, we considered the problem of minimizing the number of optical amplifiers in an optical LAN/MAN. <p> A novel iterative technique was also presented to approximately solve the general amplifier-placement problem. However, all previous work on "optimal amplifier placement" <ref> [42, 54, 70, 69] </ref> were designed to operate on "loopless" networks where there is only one path from a source to a destination. In a switched network, there can potentially be multiple paths between a source and a destination.

Reference-contexts: The electronic bit stream is stored in the buffer (labeled FIFO for the First-In-First-Out queue mechanism). The electronic signal is then used to drive the input of a tunable laser (labeled T) tuned to the desired wavelength of the output (see Fig. 4.5, from <ref> [60] </ref>). This method has been demonstrated for bit rates up to 10 Gbps [95]. However, this method is much more complex and consumes a lot more power than the other methods described below [26]. Moreover, the process of opto-electronic (O/E) conversion adversely affects transparency.

Figure 4.8 shows an asymmetric MZI wavelength converter based on SOA in XPM mode (from [26]). With the XPM scheme, the converted output signal can be either inverted or non-inverted, unlike in the XGM scheme where the output is always inverted.

Our research work focuses mainly on these third-generation optical networks. Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) <ref> [13, 51, 64, 75] </ref> is a promising technique to utilize the enormous bandwidth of the optical fiber. Multiple channels can be operated along a single fiber simultaneously, each on a different wavelength. <p> In a WDM network, it is possible to route data to their respective destinations based on their wavelengths. The use of wavelength to route data is referred to as wavelength routing, and a network which employs this technique is known as a wavelength-routed network <ref> [64] </ref>. Such a network consists of wavelength-routing switches (or routing nodes) which are interconnected by optical fibers. Some routing nodes (referred to as cross-connects) are attached to access stations where data from several end-users could be multiplexed on to a single WDM channel.

Reference-contexts: The effects of sparse conversion (i.e., having only a few converting switches in the network) on lightpath blocking have been examined in <ref> [86] </ref>. An interesting question which has not been answered thoroughly is where (optimally?) to place these few converters in an arbitrary network and what is the likely upgrade-path towards full-fledged convertibility? A heuristic technique for the placement of these sparse converters in an all-optical network is presented in [42]. 2. <p> The main differences between the models are highlighted in Table 4.1. The model described in [48] assumes that the loads on different links in the network are independent and that the busy wavelengths on different links are allocated independent of one another. The model presented in <ref> [86] </ref> incorporates the link-load dependencies using a Markov correlation method and predicts closely the behavior of an arbitrary network. The model also handles the case when only a few nodes in the network have the capability for wavelength conversion. <p> The blocking probability of the lightpaths is used to study the performance of the Chapter 4: Wavelength Conversion in WDM Networking 75 Kovacevic et al.

Reference-contexts: in WDM Networking 65 * Four-wave mixing (FWM): Four-wave mixing (also referred to as four-photon mixing) is a third-order nonlinearity in silica fibers, which causes three optical waves of frequencies f i , f j , and f k (k 6= i; j) to interact in a multichannel WDM system <ref> [89] </ref> to generate a fourth wave of frequency given by f ijk = f i + f j f k Four-wave mixing is also achievable in an active medium such as a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA).

Reference-contexts: The simplifying assumptions are that the amplifier has a flat gain over the wavelengths being amplified and that the amplifier gain is homogeneously broadened 5 . A flat gain can be achieved through various techniques such as (1) notch filters <ref> [92] </ref>, (2) different pump laser powers [34], (3) Mach-Zehnder filters [45], and (4) demultiplexers and attenuators [28].

Reference-contexts: The electronic signal is then used to drive the input of a tunable laser (labeled T) tuned to the desired wavelength of the output (see Fig. 4.5, from [60]). This method has been demonstrated for bit rates up to 10 Gbps <ref> [95] </ref>. However, this method is much more complex and consumes a lot more power than the other methods described below [26]. Moreover, the process of opto-electronic (O/E) conversion adversely affects transparency. <p> All information in the form of phase, frequency, and analog amplitude of the optical signal is lost during the conversion process. The highest degree of transparency achievable is digital transparency, where digital signals of any bit rates up to a certain limit are accommodated <ref> [95] </ref>. 2. All-optical wavelength conversion: In this method, the optical signal is allowed to remain in the optical domain throughout the conversion process. Note that, "all-optical", in this context, refers to the fact that there is no opto-electronic conversion involved. <p> Wave-mixing preserves both phase and amplitude information, offering strict transparency. It also allows simultaneous conversion of a set of multiple input wavelengths to another set of multiple output wavelengths and could potentially accommodate signals with bit rates exceeding 100 Gbps <ref> [95] </ref>. In Fig. 4.6, the value n = 3 corresponds to four-wave mixing and n = 2 corresponds to difference frequency generation. These techniques are described below. 2 A nonlinear response where new waves are generated can also happen with only a single input wave (e.g., Raman scattering). <p> This technique offers a full range of transparency without adding excess noise to the signal, and spectrum inversion capabilities, but it suffers from low efficiency <ref> [95] </ref>. The main difficulties in implementing this technique lie in the phase matching of interacting waves and in fabricating a low-loss waveguide for high conversion efficiency [95]. <p> technique offers a full range of transparency without adding excess noise to the signal, and spectrum inversion capabilities, but it suffers from low efficiency <ref> [95] </ref>.

(b)Wavelength conversion using cross modulation: These techniques utilize active semiconductor optical devices such as SOAs and lasers. These techniques belong to a class known as optical-gating wavelength conversion [95]. * Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers (SOAs) in XGM and XPM mode: The principle behind using an SOA in the cross-gain modulation (XGM) mode is shown in Fig. 4.7 (from [26]). The intensity-modulated input signal modulates the gain in the SOA due to gain saturation. <p> Moreover, deploying multiple opto-electronic converters in a WDM cross-connect requires sophisticated packaging to avoid crosstalk among channels. This leads to increased costs per converter, further making this technology less attractive than all-optical converters <ref> [95] </ref>. Other disadvantages of opto-electronic converters include complexity and large power consumption [26]. Among all-optical converters, converters based on SOAs using the XGM and the XPM conversion schemes presently seem well suited for system use. Converters based on four-wave mixing, though transparent to different modulation formats, perform inefficiently [26]. <p> In this respect, difference frequency generation based methods offer great promise. Further details on comparison of various wavelength conversion techniques can be found in <ref> [26, 63, 78, 91, 95] </ref>. <p> An important challenge in the design is to overcome the limitations in using wavelength-conversion technology. These limitations fall into the following three categories: 1. Sparse location of wavelength converters in the network: As long as wavelength converters remain expensive <ref> [95] </ref>, it may not be economically viable to equip all the nodes in a WDM network with these devices. The effects of sparse conversion (i.e., having only a few converting switches in the network) on lightpath blocking have been examined in [86]. <p> Thus, it supports the distribution of network control and management functionalities among smaller subnetworks by allowing flexible wavelength assignments within each subnetwork <ref> [72, 95] </ref>.

The quality of an optical signal degrades as it travels "long distances" through several optical components, e.g., fiber segments, WRSs, EDFAs, etc. Thus, "long-distance" light-paths may require signal regeneration at strategic locations in a nationwide or global WDM network.
