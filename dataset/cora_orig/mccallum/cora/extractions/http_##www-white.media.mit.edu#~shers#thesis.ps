Reference-contexts: Introduction Alan Turing's 1952 paper 1 , titled "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" was a first attempt to provide a scientific explanation for the patterns of pigmentation in animals <ref> [1] </ref>. Many mammals have prominent coat markings. For example, zebras have stripes, giraffes have contoured patches, leopards and cheetahs have spots; the furs of many dogs and cats also display various forms of stripes and patches of different color. <p> Suppose that we remove one dimension. Then one can design the resulting 1-D reaction-diffusion system to synthesize natural 1-D patterns. Treating the hydranth as the ring of cells proved useful for trying to explain the growth of tentacles in tubularia (see Section 2.4.4 of Chapter 2) <ref> [1] </ref>. 109 (c) (d) This model can also be applied to sound synthesis if the audio waveform is treated as the ring of sound samples. The goal is to harness the pattern-forming property of reaction-diffusion to synthesize natural-sounding music textures. <p> The output of the 112 113 steerable filters at each pixel gives the angle, i 2 [; ], and relative strength (or magnitude), m i 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, of the dominant orientation present at that pixel. <p> can be written as follows: d (~n; t) = a (~n) fl (~n; t) + s (~n) h (~n) fl (~n; t); (5.5) where ~n 2 Z 2 , a (~n) and h (~n) are the FIR filters, corresponding to A and H, respec 115 tively, and s (~n) 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref> is the original finely-quantized input image signal 1 . The advantage of using this type of the clipped M -lattice system for the pre-processing of fingerprints is that it can be guaranteed to produce binary outputs. <p> Moreover, ridges and bifurcations have been extended even into the regions where they are barely detectable in the original image. This illustrates the celebrated synergetic property of reaction-diffusion systems: the emergence from noise of a spatial pattern, whose qualitative characteristics are pre-determined by the system's parameters <ref> [1] </ref>, [12]. Using the connection machine (CM-2), the final image is produced in 25 iterations at the time step of 0:1 sec. <p> Here we show how to implement such an approach using the diagonal-state M -lattice system. Suppose ~n 2 Z 2 ; s (~n) 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref> is the finely-quantized original input image signal; y (~n) 2 f1; 1g is the output halftone image; and h (~n) is a 2-D filter (not necessarily the same as h (~n) in the previous section).

Reference-contexts: The competition between these two tendencies causes the concentration profiles of the activator and the inhibitor to settle into patterns of peaks and valleys, 180 ffi out of phase with each other 2 <ref> [3] </ref>. 2 Precise explanation follows in Chapter 3. 24 between the activator and the inhibitor morphogens are shown on a 2-D spatial lattice. <p> This is illustrated in Figure C.5. To our knowledge, the derivation presented in Appendix C is the first published mathematical demonstration of this phenomenon <ref> [3] </ref>. Separable Versus Non-Separable Filtering Observe that the diffusion mask that has been used in reaction-diffusion systems has non-zero coefficients only on the x and the y axes. Hence, the DFT of this mask does not have terms that mix the spatial frequencies in the two principal directions.

Reference-contexts: The chemical wavelength, predicted by the 1-D linear analysis, is manifested by a periodic spacing of tentacles in the tubularia. models in order to test them on biological data <ref> [4] </ref>. 1.3 General Morphogenesis Mechanism Arguably, one of the most important properties of reaction-diffusion systems is the commonality of their constituent processes, reaction and diffusion. It is conjectured that a simple and flexible mechanism is more feasible than a complex and rare one from the evolutionary point of view. <p> Bard's computer simulations indicate that this is generally true for the 1-D case, but not straightforwardly so for the 2-D case <ref> [4] </ref>, [24]. Note that Turing derived the particular form of the reaction functions in (2.4) along with the values of diffusion constants from biochemical arguments for the case of the hydranth. <p> The diffusion rate of the inhibitor is increased to D I = 16. remainder of this document. 2.6.1 Parameters For Pattern Formation This section comments on reaction-diffusion system parameter studies that have been performed by other researchers. A wide range of natural textures have been modeled by RD <ref> [4] </ref>, [24], [8], [9], [6], [10], [7], [13], [15], [14]. Diffusion Rates And Boundary Conditions Many of these studies involve keeping the same reaction function for all simulations and altering only diffusion rates and boundary conditions in order to produce various textures. <p> Time Step And Simulation Accuracy However, some studies erroneously interpreted the time step parameter, t, in (2.25) as the speed of reaction <ref> [4] </ref>, [15]. One must keep in mind that the time step is an artificial parameter, used solely for the purposes of simulating continuous-time differential equations numerically on a digital computer. <p> Bard studied the speed of pattern formation by generating concentration plots using (2.25) for a wide range of t values <ref> [4] </ref>. However, some of those values lie outside the stability region, making the reported simulations meaningless. As a rule, t should be well inside the stability region and small enough for an acceptable accuracy. <p> In Chapter 5, we will apply this property to pattern extraction in fingerprint images. Inverse Visual Appearance Of Morphogens It has been mentioned in the literature that the plots of the activator and the inhibitor appear as the negatives of one another <ref> [4] </ref>, [24]. This is illustrated in Figure C.5. To our knowledge, the derivation presented in Appendix C is the first published mathematical demonstration of this phenomenon [3].

Altering the form of reaction among morphogens and / or varying the number of morphogens in the system produces different concentration profiles. <p> But by allowing the reactants to diffuse at a constant rate, almost all the phenomena theoretically exhibited by reaction-diffusion mechanisms have been found in this real and practical reaction.

Diffusion Rates And Boundary Conditions Many of these studies involve keeping the same reaction function for all simulations and altering only diffusion rates and boundary conditions in order to produce various textures. <p> In fact, we are aware of only one success along this avenue of research [29]. Typically, reaction-diffusion systems are derived from biological arguments, with the primary effort aimed at capturing the mechanisms of animal pattern formation, and not at ensuring boundedness <ref> [6] </ref>. 3. We propose a novel method for controlling the morphogen concentrations of reaction-diffusion systems. This method draws inspiration from the way nature handles chemical resources in biological systems (see Section 4.1.1).

In particular, since 1990, there has been a significant surge in interest in reaction-diffusion systems within the computer graphics and image processing communities. The graphics community's interest in reaction-diffusion systems stems from their ability to model and synthesize directly on a three-dimensional object a wide class of natural textures. <p> A wide range of natural textures have been modeled by RD [4], [24], [8], [9], [6], [10], [7], <ref> [13] </ref>, [15], [14].

Other researchers have forced the limiting (or "clipping") on the morphogen concentrations in computer simulations by adding an "if" statement to the numerical method (e.g., Forward Euler, reviewed in Section B.3.2 of Appendix B) used for solving the system of differential equations <ref> [15] </ref>. This approach artificially prevents the morphogen concentrations from exceeding the specified bounds. But it also upsets the mathematical consistency of the original dynamical system, because it turns the continuous-time reaction-diffusion model into a discrete-time approximation.

While many of these diffusionless systems have relied on the non-linear terms to thwart the excessive growth of linearly-unstable solutions <ref> [22] </ref>, the presence of diffusion adds an enormous complexity to the model. This makes the job of finding the non-linearity that will guarantee boundedness and still preserve the pattern-forming property a formidable search.

But people have found ways to exploit chaos to do some practical things. For example, recent discoveries in the theory of chaotic systems have led researchers to novel methods for communicating secret messages [89], [90], [91]. The encryption / decryption scheme is illustrated in transmitted. <p> After all, chaotic systems are sensitive to slight changes in the initial conditions, so one might expect any errors between the transmitter and the receiver to grow exponentially [89], <ref> [22] </ref>. 144 non-linear elements. 145 in the state-space. 146 The first actual circuit built on this principle [90] uses the chaotic system, de-scribed in the pioneering work by Lorenz [92].

A wide range of natural textures have been modeled by RD [4], <ref> [24] </ref>, [8], [9], [6], [10], [7], [13], [15], [14]. Diffusion Rates And Boundary Conditions Many of these studies involve keeping the same reaction function for all simulations and altering only diffusion rates and boundary conditions in order to produce various textures. <p> For example, the same reaction-diffusion model can produce long stripes when simulated on the surface of an object shaped like a zebra and short stripes when simulated on a cat's tail <ref> [24] </ref>, [8], [9], [13]. Time Step And Simulation Accuracy However, some studies erroneously interpreted the time step parameter, t, in (2.25) as the speed of reaction [4], [15]. <p> In Chapter 5, we will apply this property to pattern extraction in fingerprint images. Inverse Visual Appearance Of Morphogens It has been mentioned in the literature that the plots of the activator and the inhibitor appear as the negatives of one another [4], <ref> [24] </ref>. This is illustrated in Figure C.5. To our knowledge, the derivation presented in Appendix C is the first published mathematical demonstration of this phenomenon [3].

Then we study the resulting equations using the Fourier analysis. From linear systems theory, multiplication in the spatial-frequency domain corresponds to convolution in the spatial-index domain [26]. <p> Many traditional, such as Bayesian or Wiener, approaches model the degradation and then design the model parameters so as to attenuate it [61], [62], [63], <ref> [25] </ref>, [64], [65].

Here we show how to implement such an approach using the diagonal-state M -lattice system. <p> The most important strength of the latest least-squares halftoning approaches is that they can employ explicit models of the human visual system and of the printing device [86], <ref> [72] </ref>. 5.5 Chapter Summary In this chapter, we have described how the M -lattice can be applied to signal synthesis and processing tasks. The model has many modes of operation, and every application explores one or more of these different regimes.

Reference-contexts: In the next section, we will show that A = B I is a good choice, because it filters out objectionable correlated spatial patterns. Halftoning with the Hopfield network would be similar, but requires setting b ii 0 <ref> [73] </ref>. Otherwise, the optimal values of y i will not be binary [37]. In addition, the Hopfield network restricts the quality metric to be a symmetric matrix, B. <p> It produces correlated artifacts of directional hysteresis that result from the raster order of processing.

But this is an impossible challenge. There is no proper way to directly extend error diffusion to 2-D, because there is no natural order in 2-D. Non-causality is what error diffusion algorithms really miss <ref> [73] </ref>, [77], [78]. A non-causal algorithm makes the decisions at any point in the image, depending on the "past" as well as on the "future" decisions, which can alleviate these shortcomings [71]. Generally, least-squares halftoning techniques render edges well, but suffer from granular artifacts. <p> Appendix D reviews the noise shaping theory, which is the underlying principle of operation of the error diffusion algorithm and the oversampling A / D converter (used in digital audio systems) [79], [80], [81], [82], [83], <ref> [73] </ref>, [84], [85]. Least-squares halftoning principles are summarized in Appendix E. Here, we use the least-squares intensity-approximation halftoning method of Section E.2 in order to illustrate that the clipped M -lattice system, (4.48), is inherently suited for incorporating the noise shaping structures into the existing least-squares halftoning techniques. <p> Error diffusion has been modeled as a Hopfield network that uses q ( i ) in place of g ( i ) <ref> [73] </ref>. However, the non-monotonicity of q ( i ) causes instability. In contrast, slightly perturbing A so as to make it negative-definite guarantees that (4.48) will be stable for binary outputs. Hence, the clipped M -lattice system is a more suitable model than the Hopfield network for non-causal error diffusion.

Reference-contexts: It is generally agreed that error diffusion produces the best results in terms of artifacts. The detail rendition capabilities of error diffusion are excellent. Highlight, mid-tone, and shadow detail are all capable of being reproduced <ref> [75] </ref>. Due to the in-loop non-linearity of the one-bit comparator, the conventional error diffusion system is restricted to be causal in order to be recursively computable. Since the neighborhood of the error filter is causal, the decisions at any point in the image depend on the "past" decisions only.

Reference-contexts: Different error propagation schemes have been proposed to cope with this. But this is an impossible challenge. There is no proper way to directly extend error diffusion to 2-D, because there is no natural order in 2-D. Non-causality is what error diffusion algorithms really miss [73], <ref> [77] </ref>, [78]. A non-causal algorithm makes the decisions at any point in the image, depending on the "past" as well as on the "future" decisions, which can alleviate these shortcomings [71]. Generally, least-squares halftoning techniques render edges well, but suffer from granular artifacts.

Reference-contexts: Since the feature space is continuous and since the Gaussian switches are not binary threshold elements, the features of the observed image will mix with the features produced by the cooperating and competing texture synthesis algorithms <ref> [87] </ref>. We believe that while facilitating the dominance of the texture prevalent in a given region, this smoothness will also provide for a natural blending together of neighboring textured regions in the processed image.
