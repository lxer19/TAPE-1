Abstract: IDA Technical Report 1995 LiTH-IDA-R-95-15 ISSN-0281-4250 Department of Computer and Information Science, Linkoping University, S-581 83 Linkoping, Sweden Systematic comparison of Abstract Most approaches to the ramification problem are based on the principle of minimization of change. It turns out, however, that this principle can not be applied uniformly, and many modern approaches use a classification of the fluents whereby change is only minimized in some of the fluents. The present article reviews these approaches and their underlying motivations. It also presents a unified formal framework whereby it is possible to compare, between different approaches, the set of selected models in each of them as well as their range of correct applicability. Finally it discusses the applicability of the Katsuno-Mendelzon postulates for these approaches. This article reports work done while the author was visiting at LAAS-CNRS, Toulouse, France. approaches to ramification

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [1] </ref>, Brewka and Hertzberg have proposed a solution for both of these problems. Nondeterminism is handled by extending the syntax of the action laws, so that each action law may specify a set of different outcomes of the action.

Reference-contexts: It would be of considerable interest to know whether, and under which circumstances, the use of transition constraints can be correctly replaced by the use of static domain constraints. The work of Cordier and Siegel <ref> [3] </ref> is one of the few investigations using transition constraints. Another common approach to ramification, besides minimal change, is the use of derived features (derived properties), that is, features whose values are supposed to be completely determined by the values of certain specified features.

Reference-contexts: One of the variants agrees with the Kartha-Lifschitz semantics for AR 0 under the assumption of standard use. In an analysis of the update postulates of Katsuno and Mendelzon [9], del Val and Shoham <ref> [4] </ref> introduced a distinction between persistent and nonpersistent features, where minimization of change is only applied to the persistent ones. Thus `persistent' in their terms may be identified with `remanent', whereas `nonpersistent' corresponds to the union of the other two categories. <p> The observation that update operations can be embedded in a temporal logic with explicit time, such as the situation calculus, was previously made by del Val and Shoham in <ref> [4] </ref>. The use of chronological application has the structural advantage that one uses the same structure for Cstat as for Nstat. <p> This was probably the first validation result in the literature on actions and change. Minimization using MSC is also equivalent to the method proposed by del Val and Shoham in <ref> [4] </ref>. The relationship of MRC to the definitions used by Kartha and Lifschitz has already been mentioned. Minimization of change according to MSCC has several interesting properties and, in particular, it is the only one of the bicategorizing methods that is always correct when secondary features are derived. <p> However, these postulates have not yet been published. The observations of the present subsection are consistent with those by del Val and Shoham <ref> [4] </ref>, who observed that Katsuno and Mendelzon's postulate U2 is not applicable for nondeterministic actions. They proposed to generalize the frame concept of Lifschitz [12] to a situation-dependent predicate persists, which turns out to be equivalent to occlusion: non-occluded = persistent; occluded = nonpersistent.

Reference-contexts: The distinction between the two reasons for not subjecting a feature to minimization of change was not important for the topic they addressed. They showed how the postulates are influenced by the distinction between persistent and nonpersistent state variables. Doherty <ref> [5] </ref> has defined an approach to ramification, called PMONR, in terms of circumscription. This entailment method is non-chronological, and generalizes an entailment method PMON which has been shown to be correct for all scenarios with strict inertia in the class K-IA [18].

Reference-contexts: We shall now introduce this additional distinction. 2.4.1 An example of the anomaly: Direction of causation in Aunt Agatha's living room We introduce this problem using a now-classical example. The living room scenario was first introduced by Ginsberg and Smith in <ref> [7] </ref>, and obtained its modern form by Winslett in [20]. The following, simplified version of the scenario is sufficient for the present purpose. Consider a room where warm, fresh air is provided through an opening in the floor, which can be blocked by putting a sufficiently large object on it. <p> Let us review some of them. The `walking turkey' scenario is a toy example of ramification which has often been mentioned in the literature. It was proposed by Ginsberg and Smith in <ref> [7] </ref>, and is analogous to Sandewall's `dead friend' example from 1972 [14]. The state domain in constructed using two binary-valued features, representing whether a particular individual is alive and whether he is walking, respectively. Then R c = fTT; TF; FFg.

Reference-contexts: Lifschitz [12] introduced a distinction between `frame' and `non-frame' features, where non-frame is essentially what we here call dependent features. Recently, Kartha and Lifschitz have defined the semantics of their action description language AR 0 <ref> [8] </ref> with a ternary categorization, where frame features (normally subject to minimization of change) can be temporarily `released' from this minimization when an action directly affecting this feature is executed. <p> This, again, defines the corresponding function Xstat. In <ref> [8] </ref>, Kartha and Lifschitz use a function Res with the same argument structure as the three functions being used here.

Reference-contexts: One of the variants agrees with the Kartha-Lifschitz semantics for AR 0 under the assumption of standard use. In an analysis of the update postulates of Katsuno and Mendelzon <ref> [9] </ref>, del Val and Shoham [4] introduced a distinction between persistent and nonpersistent features, where minimization of change is only applied to the persistent ones. Thus `persistent' in their terms may be identified with `remanent', whereas `nonpersistent' corresponds to the union of the other two categories. <p> This way of distributing over the set of starting states is in line with the general principle for update (as distinguished from revision) that was proposed by Katsuno and Mendelzon in <ref> [9] </ref>. A state will be considered as a mapping from a set F of features to corresponding feature values. <p> This, of course, is in agreement with the general notion of minimal change. A measure system hQ; d; i defines a mapping from each state r to a corresponding partial order &lt; r , as used by Katsuno and Mendelzon <ref> [9] </ref>, defined by r 0 &lt; r r 00 $ d (r; r 0 ) d (r; r 00 ): Katsuno and Mendelzon defined such an assignment to be faithful iff r &lt; r r 0 whenever r 6= r 0 , corresponding to the requirement d (r; r) d (r;

Reference-contexts: Inasmuch as Cstat performs a minimiza-tion of change, such chronological application is then synonymous with the chronological minimization of change previously proposed by Kautz in <ref> [10] </ref> and Shoham in [19].

In the present section we discuss some other of those relationships. 8.1 Chronological minimization of changes The principle of chronological minimization of change was proposed concurrently by Kautz <ref> [10] </ref>, Shoham [19], and Lifschitz [11] as a possible way of dealing with the `Yale shooting problem' anomaly. The basic idea, successively minimizing the set of changes at each point as one goes forward through time, is in concordance with the use of the approximation Cstat (E; r; MC).

Reference-contexts: He identified the range of correct applicability for several varieties of minimization of change, in a context of actions with extended duration in time and allowing nonde-terminism, but with strict inertia i.e. no ramification [17]. Lifschitz <ref> [12] </ref> introduced a distinction between `frame' and `non-frame' features, where non-frame is essentially what we here call dependent features. <p> This is of course not an acceptable solution. The same applies if one would consider to let both f 1 and f 3 be occluded features. Another scenario example with the same characteristic properties is the lightbulb and switch scenario of Lifschitz <ref> [12] </ref>. <p> However, these postulates have not yet been published. The observations of the present subsection are consistent with those by del Val and Shoham [4], who observed that Katsuno and Mendelzon's postulate U2 is not applicable for nondeterministic actions. They proposed to generalize the frame concept of Lifschitz <ref> [12] </ref> to a situation-dependent predicate persists, which turns out to be equivalent to occlusion: non-occluded = persistent; occluded = nonpersistent.

Reference-contexts: Its range of applicability has been identified to be [mc]. Similarly, MSC corresponds to the use of CMOC, which has been proven correct for all worlds with strict inertia and single-timestep actions. There are also a few results when these methods are applied to ramification. Lin and Shoham <ref> [13] </ref> have showed that MC-minimization is correct for a particular case of ramification, namely when both occluded and secondary features are deterministic. This was probably the first validation result in the literature on actions and change. <p> In both cases one of the assumptions is violated. This concludes the proof of the second proposition item. 3. The proof of the third item is analogous to the previous one. ffi The second item in this proof subsumes the earlier result by Lin and Shoham in <ref> [13] </ref> to the effect that chronological minimization of change is correct, in the presence of ramification, for completely deterministic actions, that is, actions which are deterministic for occluded features and have derived secondary features. The following is an example of a world description which is MC-conservative but not MOC-compatible. <p> The method is correctly applicable for single-timestep chronicles which are MC-compatible 3 and where all observations are for the initial state of the chronicle 4 . Lin and Shoham <ref> [13] </ref> verified the correctness of chronological minimization (essentially, PCM) for the case of deterministic occluded features, also allowing ramification but then with a requirement that secondary features be derived.

It turns out that several of the conditions on the world descriptions which were relevant for strict inertia have natural generalizations or counterparts for the case of ramification. <p> We write r for that expression that occurs in the same law as ' r . In the corresponding Xstat function, Xstat (E; r) must be the model set of r . In <ref> [17] </ref> we interpreted such action laws using a temporal logic where s and t refer to timepoints in metric (linear or branching) time. <p> The fourth component may be omitted when it is not used, that is, when it is the empty set for every argument combination. This use of the term "world description" is a generalization of the one used in <ref> [17] </ref>. There, we defined a world description for strictly inert worlds as a pair hInfl; Trajsi, where Infl is a function identifying the set of occluded features for a given action and starting state, so that it corresponds eactly to the present function Occ. <p> One frequently cited problem with chronological minimization arises in the presence of observations at other times than the initial one.

(For actions with extended duration there is a certain restriction, and for chronicles with observations for times later than zero one must use filtering as mentioned above).

Reference-contexts: Doherty [5] has defined an approach to ramification, called PMONR, in terms of circumscription. This entailment method is non-chronological, and generalizes an entailment method PMON which has been shown to be correct for all scenarios with strict inertia in the class K-IA <ref> [18] </ref>. Doherty has also showed how this circumscriptive definition can be reduced to the 4 first-order case. <p> domain constraints will therefore be phrased as follows: `under which conditions does the combination of the weakened action laws and the domain 7 constraints imply exactly the same set of possible result states as the origi-nally given and complete specification does?' The work will be based on our previously reported <ref> [17, 18] </ref> analysis of entailment methods for strict inertia, that is, without ramification. It turns out that several of the conditions on the world descriptions which were relevant for strict inertia have natural generalizations or counterparts for the case of ramification. <p> Every such choice of action law can be equivalently formulated as a function Xstat. Example 2 Continuing with the alive/dead example, one may choose to use the following action law, expressed in the notation of <ref> [18] </ref>. [s]f 1 ; :f 2 ^ [s; t]E 1 ) [t]:f 1 ; whose corresponding Xstat function is the one used above, partially defined by Xstat (E 1 ; TF) = fFT; FFg: In this case f 1 is the only occluded feature. <p> A brief explanatory note on the notation of <ref> [18] </ref>. Variables s and t may refer either to timepoints in metric time, or to situations in the situation calculus. (Such situations are considered as timepoints in a branching time, where different choices of actions result in different branches of time). <p> A world description hNstat; R c ; Occ; Depi is said to be strictly inert iff (with the corresponding Rstat function) it satisfies the equation Nstat (E; r) = fr^r j ^r 2 Rstat (E; r)g: Minimization-based entailment methods for the case of strict inertia were analyzed in detail in <ref> [18] </ref>. 3.2.2 Straight ramification In the study of the ramification problem, we are interested in ways of re-obtaining Nstat, or an approximation of Nstat, using Xstat, R c , and Occ. For simplicity we shall use the term `approximation' even when equality is actually obtained. <p> The reverse does not hold in general. For example, a strictly inert world description is deterministic for secondary features, since they are all required to retain their previous value, but it does not normally have derived secondary features. 19 3.2.5 Relationship to ontological categories for strict inertia In <ref> [18] </ref> we defined an ontological and epistemological family K-IA for strict inertia, and an ontological and epistemological taxonomy within it. In particular, the restriction to single-timestep actions was called K-IsA. <p> The set of m-compatible world descriptions will be denoted [m]. (This terminology and notation is compatible with the one used in <ref> [18] </ref>). The world description is said to be m-conservative iff Nstat (E; r) = Cstat (E; r; m) for all E and for all r 2 R c . In other words, this means that minimization using m obtains the intended results for this particular world description. <p> If a world description is strictly inert, then it is MSC-conservative. 36 2. If a world description is strictly inert, then it is MSCC-conservative. 3. If a strictly inert world is description is MC-compatible, then it is also MC-conservative. Proof Items 1 and 3 are assessments already made in <ref> [18] </ref>. The verification for the present simple case is easy: 1. Suppose in some case a world description is strictly inert, but not MSC-conservative. <p> We write [[]] for the set of models of . The set of possible result states for a 3 The definition of MC-compatible in this article is equivalent to the one used in [17] or <ref> [18] </ref>. 4 The latter distinction is a harmless one, since observations at other times than the initial one can always be handled using the technique of filtering [16]. 43 given member r of K is then obtained as Clom (r; [[]] " R c ; MC): In other words, among the

Reference-contexts: Inasmuch as Cstat performs a minimiza-tion of change, such chronological application is then synonymous with the chronological minimization of change previously proposed by Kautz in [10] and Shoham in <ref> [19] </ref>. (Lifschitz, in [11], used the same idea as an example of pointwise circumscription). The observation that update operations can be embedded in a temporal logic with explicit time, such as the situation calculus, was previously made by del Val and Shoham in [4]. <p> The case of derived secondary features was discussed in subsection 3.2.3 above.

Reference-contexts: Doherty has also showed how this circumscriptive definition can be reduced to the 4 first-order case. Somewhat related, but at a greater distance, is also the original proposal of Winslett for a `Prioritized possible models approach' (PPMA) (in <ref> [20] </ref>), where changes are minimized in all features but with different priorities. 1.4 Variants of minimization The threeways categorization of features implies that change is to be minimized for remanent features, but not for the other two categories. <p> Minimization of change in remanent (in-frame unreleased) features is then performed locally in each of the partitions. MRC and MRCC will also be compared with MC (minimization of change), which is the classical method of Winslett <ref> [20] </ref> not using any categorization of the features, and with a few other variants of minimization. Besides the usual, informal comparison of approaches using typical scenarios, we evaluate and compare the range of correct applicability and the range of soundness for these various methods. <p> The living room scenario was first introduced by Ginsberg and Smith in [7], and obtained its modern form by Winslett in <ref> [20] </ref>. The following, simplified version of the scenario is sufficient for the present purpose. Consider a room where warm, fresh air is provided through an opening in the floor, which can be blocked by putting a sufficiently large object on it. <p> The proposal of Shoham does not have this problem, but it is phrased in a complicated fashion using duration intervals of features. The proposal of Lifschitz, finally, is presented as a special application of pointwise circumscription, and the author adopted another approach soon afterwards. Around the same time, Winslett <ref> [20] </ref> proposed an approach to the update problem which is exactly equivalent to minimization using MC, although she only addressed the case of a single action and not the possibility of action sequences. A similar proposal had previously been made in the database context by Fagin et al [6]. <p> using MSC is the natural generalization of CMOC to also allow ramification under static domain constraints, although here we only consider the restricted case of binary-valued features and single-timestep actions. 8.3 Prioritized minimization of change One way of dealing with the direction of causation was proposed already by Winslett in <ref> [20] </ref> as the prioritized possible models approach (PPMA), namely to impose an ordering on the features (properties), and to prefer changes in `higher' features over those in `lower' ones.
