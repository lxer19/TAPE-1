Abstract: Wavelet transforms, when combined with quantization and a suitable encoding, can be used to compress images effectively. In order to use them for image library systems, a compact storage scheme for quantized coefficient wavelet data must be developed with a support for fast subregion retrieval. We have designed such a scheme and in this paper we provide experimental studies to demonstrate that it achieves good image compression ratios, while providing a natural indexing mechanism that facilitates fast retrieval of portions of the image at various resolutions.

Reference-contexts: The challenge is to design a storage scheme with a fast indexing mechanism such that the compression ratio is not compromised while trying to reduce the time to access a subregion. There is extensive literature available on selecting the appropriate wavelet transform (e.g., <ref> [1, 7] </ref>), and for the quantization that will provide compression by minimizing the bit allocation, while preserving much of the image quality (e.g., [9, 3, 4, 2]). <p> To further reduce storage requirements, often an extra phase of compression is applied to the quantized values, typically using entropy coding, hybrid schemes using run-length/Huffman coding <ref> [1] </ref>, or other methods [8, 6]. In this paper, we describe a scheme that provides an alternative technique for this phase, which results in similar compression performance but with superior subregion retrieval speed. The storage scheme we implemented works on any naturally quantized coefficient matrix as input. <p> The wavelet filters used in our experiments were designed to be very fast in reconstruction, since they are just 3-tap and only require integer operations 2 . But they violate the QMF criteria, and provide a slight degradation in reconstruction quality <ref> [1] </ref>. We tested our scheme with a very simple quantization scheme: the bin sizes are the same for all coefficient matrices at any given level of decomposition, and they have half the width of the bin sizes at the previous level of decomposition.
