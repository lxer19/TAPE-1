Abstract: This paper focuses on a bias variance decomposition analysis of a local learning algorithm, the nearest neighbor classifier, that has been extended with error correcting output codes. This extended algorithm often considerably reduces the 0-1 (i.e., classification) error in comparison with nearest neighbor (Ricci & Aha, 1997). The analysis presented here reveals that this performance improvement is obtained by drastically reducing bias at the cost of increasing variance. We also show that, even in classification problems with few classes (m5), extending the codeword length beyond the limit that assures column separation yields an error reduction. This error reduction is not only in the variance, which is due to the voting mechanism used for error-correcting output codes, but also in the bias.

IB1 is an implementation of the nearest neighbor classifier <ref> [ Aha, 1992 ] </ref> ) and is used as a baseline. The other algorithms (i.e., IB1 atomic (standard single-codeletter encoding), IB1 opc (one-per-class encoding), and IB1 ecoc (error correcting encoding)) differ from IB1 in that they all 5 Table 2.

Reference-contexts: In fact, research in regression theory has shown that variance can be decreased by combining the influences of instances nearby a query [ Geman et al., 1992 ] . We therefore replaced IB1 with a distance-weighted k-nearest neighbor classifier <ref> [ Atkeson et al., 1997 ] </ref> . Applied to the LED display task, both this algorithm and its ECOC variant yields variance and bias equal to zero. Variance can also be reduced by using longer codewords, as demonstrated in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: These are examples of global learning algorithms in that they generate classification predictions by examining the mappings of instances to classes in the entire training set. This distinguishes them from local learning algorithms <ref> [ Bottou and Vapnik, 1992 ] </ref> , such as the nearest neighbor classifier, which generate classification predictions by examining only the mappings of nearby instance information.

Reference-contexts: This data set is similar to the "ringnorm" data set described in [ Breiman, 1996a ] . Its Bayes optimal error rate is 0.161. Wave This data set is similar to that used in CART <ref> [ Breiman et al., 1984 ] </ref> . It has 22 features, ten classes and 300 instances. The instances belonging to class k have the 2k-th feature equal to t and the two features 2k 1 and 2k + 1 equal to t=2. All the other features are 0. <p> All the other features are 0. A random noise is added to each feature with 0 mean and 1 standard deviation. We set t = 3; the Bayes optimal error rate is 0.047. LED This is the classic LED display dataset used in CART <ref> [ Breiman et al., 1984 ] </ref> . There are seven boolean features and ten classes. The Bayes optimal error rate is 0.274. Table 4 shows the decomposition of the error for the same set of algorithms that were applied to the archival data sets.

Reference-contexts: synthesized data sets, while in Section 5 we discuss ways in which variance can be reduced and our approach can be applied to tasks with few features. 2 The Bias and Variance Decomposition This section reviews the bias/variance decomposition of the error of a classifier, following the definitions given in <ref> [ Breiman, 1996a ] </ref> and [ Friedman, 1996 ] . <p> Other classifiers skip this step and immediately build ^ Y (xjT ). For both cases an aggregate classifier Y A (x) can be defined as <ref> [ Breiman, 1996a ] </ref> : ^ f i (x) = E T [ ^ f i (xjT )] = P ( ^ Y (xjT ) = i) (4) i 2 When the approximations ^ f i (x) or ^ f i (xjT ) differ from f i (x) or f i <p> Let U be the set of instances at which ^ Y is unbiased and B its complement. At this point we can define the bias and variance of zero-one loss functions as follows <ref> [ Breiman, 1996a ] </ref> : Bias ( ^ Y ) = P ( ^ Y (x) 6= Y (x); x 2 B) P (Y B (x) 6= Y (x); x 2 B) (8) V ar ( ^ Y ) = P ( ^ Y (x) 6= Y (x); x 2 U <p> Class i is mul-tivariate normal with mean zero and covariance matrix 2 fl i 1 times the identity, i = 1; : : : ; N . This data set is similar to the "ringnorm" data set described in <ref> [ Breiman, 1996a ] </ref> . Its Bayes optimal error rate is 0.161. Wave This data set is similar to that used in CART [ Breiman et al., 1984 ] . It has 22 features, ten classes and 300 instances. <p> However, this technique has limitations, and we now describe and report additional investigations for two of them. 8 5.1 Reducing variance Kong and Dietterich [1995] showed that the variance error of C4.5 ecoc can be reduced by "voting" multiple repetitions of the same classifier built with bootstrapped training sets <ref> [ Breiman, 1996a ] </ref> . In our case (i.e., with a local classifier like IB1 ecoc ), there is also another way: "smoothing" the local classifier.

Reference-contexts: First, assuming that the Bayes optimal error rate to be zero means that we overestimate both variance and bias. This follows from Equation 10 and because all the addenda are positive. Moreover, the nearest neighbor classifier is known to have high bias <ref> [ Breiman, 1996b ] </ref> , as the decomposition of the error on artificial data sets shows (see Table 4).

Reference-contexts: This property, a natural requirement of the bias/variance decomposition, is not shared by the decomposition proposed by Kohavi and Wolpert [1996]. 3 Error Correcting Output Codes Error correcting output codes (ECOC) is a multiclass classification technique where each class is encoded as a string of codeletters called a codeword <ref> [ Dietterich and Bakiri, 1995 ] </ref> . Given a test instance, each of its codeletters is predicted, and the class whose codeword has smallest Hamming distance to the predicted codeword is assigned. <p> We briefly explored two methods to decrease variance: by increasing training set size and by increasing codeword length. 4 While IB1's variance decreased as training set size increased 3 The exhaustive codes technique <ref> [ Dietterich and Bakiri, 1995 ] </ref> , used in this case, generates only seven bit functions. 4 Increasing codeword length is an example of increasing the emphasis on "voting" [ Breiman, 6 Fig. 1. <p> Apparently this technique cannot be used for data sets with a small number of classes. The maximal number of codewords that are both column separated and row separated is 2 k1 1, where k is the number of classes <ref> [ Dietterich and Bakiri, 1995 ] </ref> . We already noted that for data sets like CLOUDS98, which has four classes, only seven different bit functions can be created. But each bit function is learned with a randomized feature selection algorithm.
