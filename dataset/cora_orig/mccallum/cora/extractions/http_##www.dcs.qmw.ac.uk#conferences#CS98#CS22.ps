Title: Ramifications and Sufficient Causes

Abstract: Most `causal' approaches to reasoning about action have not addressed the basic question of causality: what has to be the case in the world in order for the assertion `A causes B' to be valid? Pearl's recent causal theories based on structural equations do provide an answer to this question. In this paper, we extend Pearl's formalism so that the typical problems encountered in common sense reasoning about action can be represented in it. The resulting theory turns out to be a powerful tool for handling the ramification problem. It also provides new insights into actions with non-deterministic and/or `disjunctive' effects and it may help bridge the conceptual gap between `causal' and `non-causal' approaches to common sense temporal reasoning.

Reference-contexts: Recently, some authors have, either explicitly or implicitly, begun to take up this question [17, 25]. A special case of this question concerns the more well-known issue of representing actions with non-deterministic effects <ref> [1, 17, 24] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Causality-based approaches to reasoning about action and change have attracted a lot of attention over the last few years <ref> [2, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 25] </ref>, particularly in the context of modeling ramifications and actions with non-deterministic effects. Indeed, it has been argued by some [25] that the explicit modeling of causal relationships is a necessary ingredient of any solution to the ramification problem. <p> Several existing approaches employ a `causes'-construct which has a semantics similar to our Do, but usually, this construct cannot be freely combined with observations (see for example <ref> [2, 7, 15, 25] </ref>). It is this freedom that makes the representational power of our formalism go beyond most existing ones.

Reference-contexts: A remark is in order about other approaches that are based in Pearl's ideas; we mention the approaches of Darwiche and Pearl, Boutilier and Goldszmidt, and Geffner <ref> [3, 4, 5, 6] </ref>. Though all of these bear some similarities to our approach, none of them extends Pearl's theories in a way that allows free use of Do in domain axioms. Therefore they lead to formalisms that are rather different from ours.

Reference-contexts: If we equate an action or event with a set of interventions, this induces a semantics for the concepts of `action' and `event'. This resulting semantics, which will be discussed in more detail below, has sometimes been called the sufficient cause principle <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. An action that sets the value of a variable X is then called a sufficient cause for X. We give a simple example: Let us denote by Alive (t) whether or not some turkey is alive at time t. <p> One can represent theories of systems which are subject to interventions either by using causal graphs (as done in, e.g., <ref> [4, 5] </ref>) or by using sets of structural equations, as done in [21, 22]. Here, we opt for the latter possibility. Structural equations are equations with a directionality attached to them. <p> A remark is in order about other approaches that are based in Pearl's ideas; we mention the approaches of Darwiche and Pearl, Boutilier and Goldszmidt, and Geffner <ref> [3, 4, 5, 6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We are now ready to harvest. 1 Circumscription has originally been defined for first-order logic; its definition [12] also applies to the propo sitional case though, by regarding each propositional variable as a 0-ary predicate. 5 Ramifications The ramification problem <ref> [11, 13, 15, 17, 24, 25] </ref> can be defined as the problem of how to correctly represent the indirect effects of actions in a concise manner. Our Do-variables enable us to express any propositional combination of observations (e.g. :Alive (1)) and interventions (e.g. Do (Alive (1); false)). <p> Such axioms can be interpreted as saying that any intervention in the domain that sets the value of F 1 to b also sets the value of F 2 to b 0 . We start by showing how our approach handles two well-known examples: Example 3 [The Walking Turkey] <ref> [15, 11, 25] </ref> Let us assume that if our turkey is alive, it may also possibly be walking. If we shoot the turkey while it is walking, it will stop doing so. Hence :Walking is an indirect effect of Shoot, or equivalently a ramification of :Alive. <p> Several authors <ref> [11, 23] </ref> have pointed out that we do not always want to reason in the `causal direction' that is implied by the above; for example, consider the switches domain (example 4) again: if we know that the light has been put off, we may want to conclude that (at least) one <p> The case of turning off the light will be discussed in example 7. The example above leads to a problem for some of the earlier causal approaches (i.e. those of Gustafsson & Doherty and McCain & Turner ; see <ref> [11] </ref> for the details). The reason is that in these approaches, constructions similar to X Do (Y; true) are used at places where one should use Do (X; true) Do (Y; true); see the remark at the end of section 5.1. <p> Related observations have led some authors to claim that there is more to ramification than mere causal relationships as stated in Gustafsson & Doherty, `physical causality is simply one of several reasons one might set up dependencies between fluents' <ref> [11] </ref>. We think that our `Pearlian' approach sheds some new light on this issue: we define causal relations (i.e. relations involving interventions) fully in non-causal terms; this is reflected in choosing the name Do rather than Causes for our interventions.

Reference-contexts: But notice that we must do this before we replace the structural equation set eq by eq 0 (step 2 of def. 2), since this replacement will only work if the Do-propositions already have the right interpretations in each model! The required minimization can be conveniently implemented 1 using circumscription, <ref> [12, 18] </ref>: we circumscribe all Do-variables at the same time while keeping everything else (i.e. the variables in V [ U) fixed: cons = Circum (cons; fDo (X; b)jX 2 V; b 2 Bg) = Circum (cons; A (V)) For details about circumscription, see for example [12]. <p> implemented 1 using circumscription, [12, 18]: we circumscribe all Do-variables at the same time while keeping everything else (i.e. the variables in V [ U) fixed: cons = Circum (cons; fDo (X; b)jX 2 V; b 2 Bg) = Circum (cons; A (V)) For details about circumscription, see for example <ref> [12] </ref>. Suffice it to say here that it will indeed give us what we want to see this, we need a few definitions: Let X be a set of variables and Y and Z be subsets of X such that Y " Z = ;. <p> This is exactly what the circumscription achieves: Proposition 1 For any interpretation M for the variables in V [ U [ A (V): M j= cons , M is minimal for A (V) in context V [ U. The proposition is a simple corollary of proposition 1 in <ref> [12] </ref> we omit the proof. It is important to realize that the circumscription can never completely rule out any interpretations of V and U: if M j= cons, then there must be an M 0 j= cons such that Mc V [U = M 0 c V [U . <p> We are now ready to harvest. 1 Circumscription has originally been defined for first-order logic; its definition <ref> [12] </ref> also applies to the propo sitional case though, by regarding each propositional variable as a 0-ary predicate. 5 Ramifications The ramification problem [11, 13, 15, 17, 24, 25] can be defined as the problem of how to correctly represent the indirect effects of actions in a concise manner.

Example 4 The Suitcase & Switches Problem The following example is equivalent to Lin's <ref> [13] </ref> `suitcase problem'. The version we give here is adapted from [25]. <p> We leave detailed comparisons for the longer version of this paper and give only a suggestive example for now. In Thielscher's work, the equivalent of axiom (6) looks as follows ([25], page 330): :Alive causes :Walking In Lin's work <ref> [13, 14] </ref>, we would get: Caused (Alive; false; s) Caused (Walking; false; s) In McCain & Turner's approach [15, 16, 17], it would be formalized as: :Alive ) :Walking (12) where `)' is to be read as `if :Alive, then the fact that :Walking is caused' [16].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Causality-based approaches to reasoning about action and change have attracted a lot of attention over the last few years <ref> [2, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 25] </ref>, particularly in the context of modeling ramifications and actions with non-deterministic effects.

Indeed, it has been argued by some <ref> [25] </ref> that the explicit modeling of causal relationships is a necessary ingredient of any solution to the ramification problem. Still, witness the frequently heated debates on the issue taking place during workshops and conferences, it seems that many researchers remain skeptical about the power and applicability of causal approaches. <p> The theory turns out to provide a simple solution for many of the notorious problems of common-sense temporal reasoning . Moreover, we find that the resulting theory is remarkably similar to several existing causal approaches, most notably Thielscher's <ref> [25] </ref> and Lin's [13, 14]. In this paper, we concentrate on application of the theory to the ramification problem [24] and to the problem of representing actions with disjunctive effects. <p> We are now ready to harvest. 1 Circumscription has originally been defined for first-order logic; its definition [12] also applies to the propo sitional case though, by regarding each propositional variable as a 0-ary predicate. 5 Ramifications The ramification problem <ref> [11, 13, 15, 17, 24, 25] </ref> can be defined as the problem of how to correctly represent the indirect effects of actions in a concise manner. Our Do-variables enable us to express any propositional combination of observations (e.g. :Alive (1)) and interventions (e.g. Do (Alive (1); false)). <p> Such axioms can be interpreted as saying that any intervention in the domain that sets the value of F 1 to b also sets the value of F 2 to b 0 . We start by showing how our approach handles two well-known examples: Example 3 [The Walking Turkey] <ref> [15, 11, 25] </ref> Let us assume that if our turkey is alive, it may also possibly be walking. If we shoot the turkey while it is walking, it will stop doing so. Hence :Walking is an indirect effect of Shoot, or equivalently a ramification of :Alive. <p> This means that there are no models for T wt with both Alive (0) and Entice: Entice has Alive as an implicit qualification. Example 4 The Suitcase & Switches Problem The following example is equivalent to Lin's [13] `suitcase problem'. The version we give here is adapted from <ref> [25] </ref>. <p> Recently, some authors have, either explicitly or implicitly, begun to take up this question <ref> [17, 25] </ref>. A special case of this question concerns the more well-known issue of representing actions with non-deterministic effects [1, 17, 24]. <p> Several existing approaches employ a `causes'-construct which has a semantics similar to our Do, but usually, this construct cannot be freely combined with observations (see for example <ref> [2, 7, 15, 25] </ref>). It is this freedom that makes the representational power of our formalism go beyond most existing ones. <p> We have already shown (but could not include it due to length constraints on this paper) that it can be put to good use in the `turkey at the trap-door' scenario of Thielscher <ref> [25] </ref> and to handle `dependent fluents' [7]; we will show this in the longer version of the paper. There we will also give a detailed comparison of our work to that of McCain and Turner [15, 16, 17] and Thielscher [25]. <p> use in the `turkey at the trap-door' scenario of Thielscher <ref> [25] </ref> and to handle `dependent fluents' [7]; we will show this in the longer version of the paper.

A remark is in order about other approaches that are based in Pearl's ideas; we mention the approaches of Darwiche and Pearl, Boutilier and Goldszmidt, and Geffner [3, 4, 5, 6].
