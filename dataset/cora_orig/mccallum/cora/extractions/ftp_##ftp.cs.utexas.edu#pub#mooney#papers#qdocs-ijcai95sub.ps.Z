Abstract: This paper describes an approach to performing diagnosis on complex dynamic systems described by qualitative differential equations. An implemented system QDOCS is described that performs multiple-fault diagnosis on systems modeled with QSIM. Constraint satisfaction techniques are used to determine sets of component modes that are inconsistent with observed qualitative behaviors. Most probable diagnoses are computed from the resulting conflicts sets. The utility of the system is illustrated by accurately and efficiently diagnosing randomly generated faults in a model of the Re action Control System of the space shuttle.

Reference-contexts: Each of these systems concentrates on different aspects of the monitoring process, but none performs multiple-fault diagnosis using behavioral modes. Some recent work by Dressler <ref> (Dressler, 1994) </ref> performs model-based diagnosis on a dynamical system (a ballast tank system) using a variant of GDE. It first reduces the model to a version suitable for constraint propagation, and then considers only conflicts generated by constraints acting at a particular time.

Reference-contexts: Previous approaches to diagnosing faults in QSIM models have been limited in scope and have been unable to work with fault modes (Ng, 1990; Lackinger and Nejdl, 1991) or have made a single-fault assumption <ref> (Dvorak, 1992) </ref>. Most previous work on model-based diagnosis (Reiter, 1987; de Kleer and Williams, 1987) has concentrated on static systems and is generally insufficient to diagnose continuous dynamic systems. <p> Note that because of the nature of this problem, where every variable is potentially dependent on every component, this is the best possible approximation of a structural dependence strategy of the type used in MIMIC <ref> (Dvorak, 1992) </ref>. Figure 5 gives the results of running QDOCS and a simpler generate-and-test algorithm on simulated behaviours from each of the models. The results are averaged over 50 randomly produced faults. <p> Again, due to its dependence on the simple constraint propagation in INC-DIAGNOSE, it is only able to detect a small subset of possible faults which QDOCS can diagnose. The other previous diagnosis work on QSIM models, MIMIC <ref> (Dvorak, 1992) </ref>, has several limitations. First, MIMIC requires the model builder to provide a structural model of the system in addition to the QSIM constraint model. This structural model was fixed and could not change under different fault models.

Reference-contexts: This is clearly combinatorially explosive and therefore, the simpler algorithm is used despite the fact that the conflict sets obtained are not guaranteed minimal. Of course, the constraint propagation techniques used by most model-based diagnosis systems are also not guaranteed to generate minimal conflicts <ref> (Forbus and de Kleer, 1993) </ref>. For the second part of the algorithm, QDOCS must track a QSIM simulation and match all possible successors at each stage of the simulation with given sensor readings.

Reference-contexts: These subsystems help deliver the fuel and oxidizer into a reaction chamber where they ignite to provide thrust. A model of one of these subsystems has been successfully modelled using QSIM and simulated in various fault modes <ref> (Kay, 1992) </ref>. We ran two experiments to try and evaluate the usefulness of QDOCS in this domain. In the first experiment, a part of the pictured subsystem of the RCS was modeled. This model was originally used to test an earlier version of QDOCS (Subramanian and Mooney, 1994).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One class of engineering problems that must be addressed by qualitative reasoning if it is to be useful in real applications is that of diagnosis. The approach to diagnosis described in this paper uses QSIM <ref> (Kuipers, 1994) </ref> as the modelling language and applies a very general diagnostic technique to these models.

Reference-contexts: If this was not the case, the propagator would not detect some conflicts. QDOCS, on the other hand, uses behavioral-mode information and a complete constraint-satisfaction algorithm. Another system that used the INC-DIAGNOSE approach in the context of a monitoring system is DIAMON <ref> (Lackinger and Nejdl, 1991) </ref>. Again, due to its dependence on the simple constraint propagation in INC-DIAGNOSE, it is only able to detect a small subset of possible faults which QDOCS can diagnose. The other previous diagnosis work on QSIM models, MIMIC (Dvorak, 1992), has several limitations.

Reference-contexts: The diagnostic architecture is similar to SHER LOCK (de Kleer and Williams, 1989) and the algorithm builds on INC-DIAGNOSE <ref> (Ng, 1990) </ref>. The system uses a general constraint-satisfaction technique to detect faults and trace dependencies in order to generate conflicts and diagnoses. A QSIM-based simulation component is used to verify hypotheses and detect additional inconsistencies. <p> However, QSIM requires a more complete constraint satisfaction algorithm since a qualitative constraint typically does not entail a unique value for a remaining variable when all its other variables have been assigned. An earlier attempt to use QSIM to track dependencies for diagnosis <ref> (Ng, 1990) </ref> only used a simple propagator. Since the propagator alone is not complete, Ng's program, INC-DIAGNOSE is not guaranteed to detect all inconsistencies. <p> We intend to explore ways in which to cache this information and test their utility in improving the efficiency of QDOCS. 6 Related Work Compared to QDOCS, the previous diagnosis systems for QSIM models all have important limitations. INC-DIAGNOSE <ref> (Ng, 1990) </ref> was an application of Reiter's theory of diagnosis (Reiter, 1987) to QSIM models.

INC-DIAGNOSE (Ng, 1990) was an application of Reiter's theory of diagnosis <ref> (Reiter, 1987) </ref> to QSIM models. Its main limitations were that first, like Reiter's theory, it was restricted to models where no fault mode information was known, and second, it used a constraint propagator that was not guaranteed to detect all inconsistencies.

This model was originally used to test an earlier version of QDOCS <ref> (Subramanian and Mooney, 1994) </ref>. The second experiment was on a more complete model of the subsystem modeled by Kay. The two experiments helped to gauge the relationship between the efficiency of the QDOCS system and model size. <p> Fault modes for these sensors were also modeled. All of these components also have an unknown mode where the variables acted upon are unconstrained. A reasonable probability distribution was assigned to these faults. The complete model has 12 components and 80 constraints. The smaller RCS model used in <ref> (Subramanian and Mooney, 1994) </ref> consisted of just the helium tank, the pressure regulators and the fuel tank. This model has 6 components and 42 constraints. The a priori probabilities were used to randomly generate sets of faults for this model.

Reference-contexts: QSIM's approach to solving the CSP is to 1. establish node consistency by ensuring that each constraint is satisfied by the possible values of the variables it acts upon, and 2. using Waltz filtering <ref> (Waltz, 1975) </ref> to establish arc consistency, by propagating the re sults of step 1 to other variables and constraints, and, finally, 3. using backtracking to assign values to variables.
