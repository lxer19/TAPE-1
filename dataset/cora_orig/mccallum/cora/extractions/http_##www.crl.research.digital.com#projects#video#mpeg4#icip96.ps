Abstract: This paper proposes a new technique to build a background memory based on mosaicking. More precisely, the technique first identifies background and foreground regions based on local motion estimates. Camera motion is then estimated on the background by applying a parametric global motion estimation. Finally, after compensating for camera motion, the background content is temporally integrated in long-term memory. The method leads to high coding performances and allows for content-based functionalities.

Reference-contexts: One of the most pertinent problem in video coding lies in the coding of uncovered background areas. In this case, the classical motion compensated prediction scheme is unable to predict newly appearing areas and hence leads to poor performances. To overcome this problem, background memory techniques have been proposed <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. More precisely, these techniques identify still regions as background and stored them in a long term memory. Whenever an area is uncovered, and providing that it has been visible in the past, the information unavailable with classical prediction techniques can be retrieved from the background memory. <p> where M (~r; t) denotes the dynamic mosaic at location ~r and time t, t a (t) is the sum of the global motion parameters obtain pairwise between consecutive frames over the time period between the reference and the current frames, ff is a weighting factor such as ff 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and ffi (~r) = 1 if ~r belongs to the background and 0 otherwise.

Reference-contexts: These algorithms are effective for video-conference and video-phone sequences which are characterized by a still background. However, the model of a still background does no longer hold for more complex scenes which include camera motion (e.g. pan or zoom). In order to integrate temporal information, mosaic representations <ref> [3, 4] </ref>, also referred to as salient still [5], have shown to be efficient. Basically, these techniques estimate the camera motion through global motion estimation and align the images in the sequence by canceling the contribution of camera motion. <p> Dynamic mosaic of the background Once the background has been segmented and the camera motion estimated, the background information is temporally integrated by mosaicking. In <ref> [3] </ref>, a distinction is made between static and dynamic mosaics. The static mosaic integrates the information of all the frames in a video segment (e.g. mean, median, weighted mean, weighted median).

Reference-contexts: However, in low contrast areas, the local motion estimation is undercon-strained and the resulting motion vectors are unreliable. In this case, the above classification based on motion similarity may fail. To overcome this difficulty, the residual information present in the prediction error is also exploited <ref> [6] </ref>. Namely, if, for an area, the residual obtained with the dominant motion is similar to the one obtained when using the local motion vector, then this area is also assigned to the background.

Reference-contexts: The camera motion is modeled by a parametric motion model. For this purpose, two models are widely used, the affine model and the perspective model <ref> [7] </ref>. <p> In order to relax this constraint, the 8-parameters perspective model is rather used in this paper. This model allows for the representation of the motion of a planar surface under perspective projection. In order to robustly estimate the motion parameters, a matching technique is used <ref> [7] </ref>. This technique has been shown to outperforms differential and linear regression techniques [8].

Reference-contexts: Finally, the process of integrating many frames in the mosaic is filtering the noise in the sequence, leading to better prediction. Besides, the background mosaic may also be used to construct an artificial high resolution panoramic view of the background similarly to <ref> [9] </ref>. 3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Experimental results are presented in this section. Two sequences in CIF format have been used.
