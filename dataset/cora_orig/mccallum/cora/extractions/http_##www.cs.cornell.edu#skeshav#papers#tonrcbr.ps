Abstract: Variable bit rate compressed video trac is expected to be a signitcant component of the trac mix in integrated services networks. This trac is hard to manage because it has strict delay and loss requirements while simultaneously exhibiting burstiness at multiple time-scales. We show that burstiness over long time-scales, in conjunction with resource reservation using one-shot trac descriptors, can substantially degrade the loss rate, end-to-end delay and statistical multiplexing gain of a connection. We use large-deviation theory to model the performance of multiple time-scale trac and to motivate the design of Renegotiated Constant Bit Rate (RCBR) Service. Sources using RCBR service are presented with an abstraction of a txed-size buer which is drained at a constant rate. They may renegotiate the drain rate to match their workload. Because all trac entering the network is CBR, RCBR requires minimal buering and scheduling support in switches. We show that the service is suitable for both stored and online video sources. An RCBR source must decide when to renegotiate its service rate, and what the new service rate should be. We present a) an algorithm to compute the optimal renegotiation schedule for stored (o-line) trac, and b) a heuristic to approximate the optimal schedule for online trac. We also discuss measurement-based admission control for RCBR trac. Simulation experiments show that RCBR is able to extract almost all of the statistical multiplexing gain available by exploiting slow time-scale variations in trac. Moreover, simple admission control schemes are sucient to keep the renegotiation failure probability below a small threshold, while still oering high fl This work has been presented in part at NOSSDAV '95 [19] and at ACM SIGCOMM '95 [18].

Reference-contexts: Thus, signaling for renegotiation is much less expensive than signaling for call setup and need not use the same protocol. This allows us to exploit lightweight signaling mechanisms for renegotiation. A hardware implementation of signaling for renegotiation is described in <ref> [3] </ref>. In an ATM network, sources can reuse the Resource Management (RM) cell mechanism, originally proposed for ABR service, for lightweight signaling. An RCBR source sets the Explicit Rate (ER) teld in the RM cell to the dierence between its old and new rates 3 . <p> The two core mechanisms for RCBR are renegotiation and rate prediction. In-call renegotiation has been proposed for bursty data trac by Hui [23], Turner [43], Doshi and Dravida [9], and Boyer and Tranchier <ref> [3] </ref>. In their work, a trac source sets up a burst level reservation before sending, or in some cases during a burst. However, since data trac bursts can occur every tens of milliseconds the reservation process has to be fast.

Reference-contexts: Recent work suggests that even stored video can be dynamically requantized in order to respond to these signals <ref> [38, 10] </ref>. Thus, there are several viable alternatives for dealing with renegotiation failures. With an appropriate combination, some users can choose to see few or no renegotiation failures, while others might 5 trade o a non-zero renegotiation failure rate for a lower cost of service.

Reference-contexts: A bursty source occasionally transmits at a peak rate signitcantly larger than its long term average rate. Recent research has determined another key characteristic: the presence of trac variations over multiple time-scales <ref> [34, 35, 12, 13] </ref>.

The stream we have used is the MPEG-1 encoded trace of the Star Wars movie <ref> [12] </ref>. The n sources are randomly shifted versions of this trace. The buer size B was chosen as 300kbit, slightly more than the maximum size of three consecutive frames in the trace. This approximately corresponds to the buering of current video codecs.

Our scheme achieves slightly less SMG than the unrestricted case because buers are not shared and the fast time-scale multiplexing gain is not exploited, as explained in the theoretical analysis.

Reference-contexts: A statistical service has the disadvantage of being hard to police. Also, it is cumbersome or impossible for the user to come up with a tight a-priori trac descriptor.

Measurement-based admission control shifts the burden of trac parameter specitcation from the user to the network. Instead of the user giving an explicit trac specitcation, the network attempts to learn the statistics of existing calls by making on-line measurements. This approach has several advantages.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, this scheme is also memoryless, i.e. every time a new call arrives, the scheme uses only information about the current state of the network in making the decision of accepting or rejecting the call. This memoryless certainty-equivalent scheme has also been studied by Gibbens et. al. <ref> [16] </ref> in the context of admission control of on-o sources. Note that the error associated with any estimation procedure can translate into erroneous call admission decisions, which in turn can compromise the QoS provided to users. <p> In other words, in the ABR case the rate information ows from the network to user; in the RCBR case, the information ows from the user to the network. Our work on admission control is related to that described in Gibbens et al <ref> [16] </ref>. They advocate an approach based on using the current trac load measurement in making admission control decisions.

Reference-contexts: Because a source is described by a single number, the admission control test is trivial. Moreover, because trac entering the network is smooth, internal buers can be small and packet scheduling need only be FIFO <ref> [17] </ref>. With RCBR, a source can renegotiate its service rate. Renegotiation consists of sending a signaling message requesting an increase or decrease in the current service rate. If the request is feasible, the network allows the renegotiation. <p> First, it is relatively easy to implement, since we are adding a renegotiation component to the well-understood Static CBR service. While RCBR admission control is potentially complex, this is more than balanced by the fact that neither complex scheduling disciplines nor large buers are required in the network switches <ref> [17] </ref>. RCBR allows us to keep the network core fast, cheap and dumb (at least in the data path), and put intelligence in the edges to extract the SMG from slow time-scale variations.

Reference-contexts: Note that RCBR is the simplest possible renegotiated service. An RCBR source must determine when to renegotiate and what rate to choose during a renego 1 An earlier version of this paper appeared in ACM SIGCOMM '95 <ref> [18] </ref>. This version has fewer details on large deviation modeling, but a more detailed study of admission control. 2 For notational convenience, we will refer to a variable bit rate compressed video source simply as a `compressed video source'. 2 tiation. These decisions constitute a per-source renegotiation schedule. <p> Thus, Cherno's approximation quantites the amount of slack needed in the available capacity. The accuracy of this approximation is quite good. We refer the reader to <ref> [18] </ref> for an experimental veritcation of the Cherno bound. In practice, we often do not have a reliable trac descriptor. Even for stored video, where the empirical bandwidth distribution could be computed in advance, user interactivity (fast forward, pause etc.) reduces the accuracy of this descriptor. <p> As pointed out by Hajek and He [21], second-order statistics alone do not uniquely specify loss probabilities and thus it is important to understand the regime in which these approximations are valid. Second, we have obtained an optimal o-line renegotiation algorithm <ref> [18] </ref>. Third, we have considered admission control for renegotiating sources. Finally, we have considered the system aspects of the problem in more detail. Nevertheless, we feel that their work complements ours, in that it reinforces the importance of renegotiation for multiple time-scale sources.

Reference-contexts: the network interface (i.e. the session layer or NIU) is expected to be no more than a few milliseconds away from the end point, the control loop between the network interface and the user will be tight, so that responding to such signals should be easy, particularly for adaptive codecs <ref> [27] </ref>. Recent work suggests that even stored video can be dynamically requantized in order to respond to these signals [38, 10]. Thus, there are several viable alternatives for dealing with renegotiation failures.

RVBR allows more SMG, since both slow and fast time-scale variations are exploited.

Reference-contexts: Recent work suggests that even stored video can be dynamically requantized in order to respond to these signals <ref> [38, 10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A large buer B in this context means that the buer is suciently large to smooth out the uctuation of the trac stream. Analogous results have been obtained for multiple time-scale Markov trac <ref> [41] </ref>. For multiple time-scale sources, one now has to look at the joint asymptotic regime when simultaneously the rare transition probabilities ff i 's are close to zero and the buer size B is large enough to absorb the fast time-scale uctuations of the stream.

For multiple time-scale sources, one now has to look at the joint asymptotic regime when simultaneously the rare transition probabilities ff i 's are close to zero and the buer size B is large enough to absorb the fast time-scale uctuations of the stream. It is shown in [41] that the equivalent bandwidth e (p qos ) of the multiple time-scale stream is given by e (p qos ) = max e k (p qos ); (9) where e k (p qos ) is the equivalent bandwidth of the kth fast time-scale sub-chain when considered in isolation. <p> as nB (i.e. the link capacity and buer space per stream is txed in this scaling), an estimate of the buer overow probability, in the regime of large n, can be obtained in terms of only slow time-scale statistics of the individual stream (with the fast time-scale dynamics averaged out.) <ref> [41] </ref>. Specitcally, consider a random variable which takes on the value k with probability k , where k is the steady-state probability that the stream is in sub-chain k and k is the mean rate of sub-chain k.

Reference-contexts: A statistical service has the disadvantage of being hard to police. Also, it is cumbersome or impossible for the user to come up with a tight a-priori trac descriptor. Therefore, we propose to use measurement-based admission control (MBAC) in conjunction with RCBR <ref> [26, 15, 42, 20] </ref>. Measurement-based admission control shifts the burden of trac parameter specitcation from the user to the network. Instead of the user giving an explicit trac specitcation, the network attempts to learn the statistics of existing calls by making on-line measurements. This approach has several advantages. <p> It is important to look at the heterogeneous case as well. These questions are outside the scope of this paper. We refer the reader to some of our recent work on measurement-based admission control <ref> [20, 42] </ref>. 7 Related Work The key contributions of our paper are: (a) to note that compressed video trac has signitcant burstiness in the slow time-scale, (b) showing that renegotiation allows us to extract almost all the SMG available from exploiting this variation, and (c) admission control for loosely-constrained trac sources.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, we feel that their work complements ours, in that it reinforces the importance of renegotiation for multiple time-scale sources. The two core mechanisms for RCBR are renegotiation and rate prediction. In-call renegotiation has been proposed for bursty data trac by Hui [23], Turner <ref> [43] </ref>, Doshi and Dravida [9], and Boyer and Tranchier [3]. In their work, a trac source sets up a burst level reservation before sending, or in some cases during a burst. However, since data trac bursts can occur every tens of milliseconds the reservation process has to be fast.

Reference-contexts: To minimize these glitches, the coding rate has to be large enough to encode all but a few of the scenes in the video stream, leading to a reduction in the available statistical multiplexing gain <ref> [44] </ref>. This has led to great interest in variable bit rate video compression, and techniques for carrying such trac in computer networks [6, 7, 32, 33, 29, 1]. 2 A key characteristic of a compressed video source is its burstiness.

Reference-contexts: O-line sources can compute the renegotiation schedule in advance and can initiate renegotiations in anticipation of changes in the source rate. Moreover, if all systems in the network share a common time base, advance reservations could be done for some or all of the data stream <ref> [47] </ref>. Interactive applications must compute the renegotiation schedule on-the-y. For such applications, we propose that an active component monitor the buer between the application and the network and initiate renegotiations based on the buer occupancy.

Reference-contexts: However, refreshes are currently viewed primarily as a mechanism for state management, rather than for rate adaptation. Sources are therefore expected to choose a token rate once and to merely repeat this request when refreshing their reservation <ref> [49] </ref>). If sources exhibiting bursts at multiple time scales are allowed only a single drain rate to describe their behavior, they are faced with a series of poor choices. <p> To overcome this, we can resynchronize rates by periodically sending an RM cell with the true explicit rate, instead of a dierence. 6 In the Integrated Services Internet, sources and receivers periodically refresh their network reser-vation state using the RSVP signaling protocol <ref> [49] </ref>. A source periodically emits a PATH message describing its characteristics, and each receiver periodically emits a RESV message requesting a reservation.
