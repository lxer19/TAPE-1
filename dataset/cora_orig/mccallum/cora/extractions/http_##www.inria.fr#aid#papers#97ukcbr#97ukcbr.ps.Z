Abstract: email: -Michel.Jaczynski, Brigitte.Trousse -@sophia.inria.fr Abstract: The World Wide Web is a huge hypermedia where finding relevant documents is not an easy task. In this paper, we present our case-based browsing advisor, called B ROADWAY . B ROADWAY follows a group of users during their navigations on the WWW (proxy-based architecture) and advise them by displaying a list of potentially relevant documents to visit next. B ROADWAY uses case-based reasoning to reuse precise experiences derived from past navigations with a time-extended situation assessment: the advice are based mainly on similarity of ordered sequence of past accessed documents. In addition, the dynamic of the

Reference-contexts: Letizia uses the time spend by the user reading the current document to explore the neighbourhood and anticipate users browsing. However, Letizia does not learn from its experiences and it builds only a description of the users interest for the current session by recording its actions. WebWatcher <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> follows the user along its navigation and highlights the hyperlinks of the current page that are of interest. WebWatcher learns from previous navigation of different users based on several machine learning algorithms. <p> Browsing advisors designed for the WWW learn from a group of users time-extended situation browser independent Radix [7] yes yes no Hypercase [18] no no no - Hospitext [9] no yes yes - Letizia [15] yes no no no WebWatcher <ref> [1] </ref> yes yes no yes PWW [19] yes no no yes 6. Conclusion In this paper we have introduce B ROADWAY , our browsing advisor for the World Wide Web, which uses case-based reasoning to advise pages by reusing past navigations of a group of users.

Reference-contexts: The evolution over time of each variable is represented as a time series. Above the concept of a record, we have defined three types of cases: abstract, potential and concrete cases. Abstract cases come from the domain knowledge or they are built by manual or automatic generalisation <ref> [ 2 ] </ref>. Potential cases do not have any concrete representation, and the knowledge they represent is hidden inside the records that are stored in memory. They can be identified by a direct search inside the records according to a potential case template defining typical situation constraints.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The World Wide Web (WWW) [ 14 ] is an hypermedia of heterogeneous and dynamic documents. This virtual space is growing more and more every day, offering to the user a huge amount of data <ref> [ 3 ] </ref>. Two kinds of methods can be used to locate a relevant document through this space: querying and browsing. Querying is appropriate when the user has a clear goal which should usually be expressed through a list of keywords.

Reference-contexts: These properties have been studied in many works <ref> [ 16 , 4 ] </ref> and lead to the development of high level applications such as a WWW document annotation server [ 24 ] to support a group of users. B ROADWAY external architecture is in the straight line of these works.

Reference-contexts: Related Works We have analysed the different hypermedia browsing advisors according to our goals. We have separated case-base approaches from others and the comparison is summarised at the end of the section in Figure 9. 5.1 Case-Based Browsing Advisors Radix <ref> [ 7 ] </ref> is based on a deeper description of the browsing session than B ROADWAY . The observation of users actions, such as bookmark selection, page address edition, back or forward link selection, are required to represent a session and its components. <p> However, the order of the accessed pages is not taken into account and inaccuracy may be caused by caching mechanisms from proxies and browsers. Browsing advisors designed for the WWW learn from a group of users time-extended situation browser independent Radix <ref> [7] </ref> yes yes no Hypercase [18] no no no - Hospitext [9] no yes yes - Letizia [15] yes no no no WebWatcher [1] yes yes no yes PWW [19] yes no no yes 6.

Reference-contexts: A case is an entire information retrieval session whereas in B ROADWAY a case represents a specific experience in a navigation. A time-extended situation is taken into account with a event-driven similarity <ref> [ 8 ] </ref> during the retrieval. It is not clear how Radix could manage a group of users even if it uses an objectoriented database to store cases. Radix uses a specific browser with customised functions to watch users actions, so its use is restricted to a specific platform.

Reference-contexts: A time-extended situation represents not only the current state of the observed navigation but also its past sequence of events. We claim as others <ref> [ 7 , 9 ] </ref> that a particular state of the navigation (current document and/or an instantaneous description) is not sufficient to compute relevant advice. In order to better describe the users implicit intent during browsing, we want to consider past visited documents and their access order. <p> Few existing applications in Case-Based Reasoning have tried to represent and use behavioural situations inside cases: robot control [21], process forecast [22,20], process supervision [10], trend prognoses for medical problems [ 25], medical risk detection and forecast [ 5], plant nutrition control [ 11 ], WWW navigation <ref> [ 7 , 9 ] </ref> (cf. [12] for a detailed analysis). To cope with this kind of situations, we have designed and implemented a framework for the representation and the retrieval of the cases indexed by a time-extended situation [ 11 ]. <p> The definition of each node is required and this approach is not appropriate to address WWW navigation assistance. In addition, Hypercase cannot learn from real navigations of a group of users because its reasoning is only based on prestored cases built by experts. The goal of Hospitext <ref> [ 9 ] </ref> is to assist different types of users during the browsing of medical records of patients. It learns from past navigation and a hierarchy of navigation behaviour is built. Hospitext uses domain knowledge mainly in the definition of a taxonomy of documents used in the case matching. <p> Browsing advisors designed for the WWW learn from a group of users time-extended situation browser independent Radix [7] yes yes no Hypercase [18] no no no - Hospitext <ref> [9] </ref> no yes yes - Letizia [15] yes no no no WebWatcher [1] yes yes no yes PWW [19] yes no no yes 6.

In this framework we propose the separation of observation data stored in records from the cases which reference relevant data inside a record. Records are used to store the observation data of the dynamic process through a fixed number of variables and during a defined time interval. <p> In addition, B ROADWAY is implemented in Java using our software library CBR*Tools that supports our framework for the management of cases with time-extended situations [ 11 , 12 ]. B ROADWAY is the second application of this framework (cf. <ref> [ 11 ] </ref>). Our aim is to provide generic CBR tools and methods to support reasoning with time-extended situations. The relevance of advice given by B ROADWAY must still be carefully evaluated.

Reference-contexts: Representation of Navigational Cases In order to improve the advice given by B ROADWAY , our goal is to make a time-extended situation assessment during the reasoning. We have previously led an analysis of the management of time-extended situations in case-based reasoning <ref> [ 12] </ref> and we have designed a framework for the representation and the retrieval of cases with time-extended situation [ 11 ].

Reference-contexts: Then, the user must navigate through this space, moving from one node to another, looking for a relevant document. These two approaches can be mixed so that querying gives a list of reasonable starting points for browsing <ref> [ 13 ] </ref>. However, the huge size and the structure of this space make difficult the indexing of the documents required by querying access methods and could disorient the user during a browsing session.

Reference-contexts: B ROADWAY external architecture is in the straight line of these works. Other browsing advisors have also chosen a proxy-based architecture <ref> [ 19 ] </ref>. B ROADWAY accepts multiple simultaneous connections allowing a group of users to share their navigation experiments on the web. Each user is identified by a user name and a password based on the standard proxy authentication mechanism defined in the HTTP protocol. <p> WebWatcher is based on a HTTP stream transducer not implemented by a proxy, and the all HTML pages must be analysed and altered to redirect hyperlinks to itself. PersonalWebWatcher (PWW) <ref> [ 19 ] </ref> is similar to WebWatcher but it aims to assist only one user with this time a proxy-based architecture. Yan et al . [ 28 ] propose a modified WWW server that logs all documents access for a user session. <p> Browsing advisors designed for the WWW learn from a group of users time-extended situation browser independent Radix [7] yes yes no Hypercase [18] no no no - Hospitext [9] no yes yes - Letizia [15] yes no no no WebWatcher [1] yes yes no yes PWW <ref> [19] </ref> yes no no yes 6. Conclusion In this paper we have introduce B ROADWAY , our browsing advisor for the World Wide Web, which uses case-based reasoning to advise pages by reusing past navigations of a group of users.
