Reference: [1] <author> M. Baudinet and D. MacQueen. </author> <title> Tree pattern matching for ML (extended abstract). </title> <type> Draft, </type> <year> 1985. </year>
Reference-contexts: I will therefore spend a few moments going over representations. My choice of representations has been guided, at least in part, by the work of <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. 4.3.1 Variables, Constructors and Patterns As we shall soon see, the patterns that we will be compiling are composed of variables and constructors.
