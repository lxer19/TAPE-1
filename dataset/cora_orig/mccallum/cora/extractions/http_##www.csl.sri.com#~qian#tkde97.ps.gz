Title: A Semantic Framework of the Multilevel Secure Relational Model

Abstract: A multilevel relational database represents information in a multilevel state of the world, which is the knowledge of the truth value of a statement with respect to a level in a security lattice. We develop a semantic framework of the multilevel secure relational model with tuple-level labeling, which formalizes the notion of validity in multilevel relational databases. We also identify the multilevel security properties that precisely characterize the validity of multilevel relational databases, which can be maintained efficiently. Finally, we give an update semantics of the multilevel secure relational model that preserves both integrity and secrecy.

In fact, Burns [2] noticed that such integrity enforcement is in fundamental conflict with secrecy enforcement: no multilevel relational databases could simultaneously satisfy both integrity and secrecy requirements. Polyinstantiation has been proposed as a possible solution to this problem in the limited context where constraints consist of key-based functional dependencies only. <p> Our semantic framework is consistent with, and extends, the Bell-LaPadula model. Compared with existing approaches, our semantic framework maximizes believability without sacrificing integrity, compromising secrecy, or introducing ambiguity. Contrary to the claim that integrity and secrecy are in fundamental conflict <ref> [2] </ref>, [13], [24], our results demonstrate that integrity and secrecy could live in harmony with each other: a multilevel relational database does not have to give up one for the other. Moreover, validity checking in multilevel relational databases is comparable to that in single-level relational databases in terms of complexity.

Reference-contexts: Although we provide a characterization of the validity of multilevel relational databases using polyinstantiation and referential security properties, a thorough treatment of such metaknowledge is out of the scope of this paper and appears elsewhere <ref> [15] </ref>. 2 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING B. Integrity versus Secrecy Because of the co-existence of multiple views of reality in multilevel relational databases, the notion of integrity is problematic. <p> Update semantics in the multilevel secure relational model has been proposed for variations of the polyin-stantiation constraint [6], [7], [9], [12], and for the no-polyinstantiation constraint [17], [23], but not for the referential constraint. While the polyinstantiation constraint is relatively easy to enforce, we have shown <ref> [15] </ref> that there does not exist an update semantics which has all the desirable properties identified in Section IV, and which enforces the no-polyinstantiation constraint. For example, the update semantics of [17] introduces partial inference channels, and the update semantics of [23] leads to loss of high information.

Reference-contexts: Since b and b a captures the same elementary facts, B and its atomic decomposition B a are semantically equivalent <ref> [16] </ref>. Notice that every tuple in b is in general broken into several smaller tuples in b a . Therefore every elementary fact captured by b is equivalent to a conjunction of perhaps several smaller elementary facts captured by b a . <p> Polyinstantiation has been proposed as a possible solution to this problem in the limited context where constraints consist of key-based functional dependencies only.

Reference-contexts: Section IV gives an update semantics of the multilevel secure relational model that preserves both integrity and secrecy. Related work is discussed in Section V. Finally, Section VI gives some concluding remarks. II. Relational Model We take the standard definition of the relational model <ref> [21] </ref>, and characterize the information content of relational databases in terms of atomic decomposition. We then define filtering functions, and discuss their properties in terms of information content. These properties will be used later to formalize the validity of multilevel relational databases. A.
