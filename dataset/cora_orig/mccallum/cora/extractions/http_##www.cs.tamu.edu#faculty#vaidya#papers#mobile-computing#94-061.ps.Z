Abstract: Location management consists of location update and search protocols. Trade-off in location management is between the cost of searches and the cost of updates. The goal of an "efficient" location management strategy is to reduce the search and update costs. In this paper, we show that, using forwarding pointers in addition to home location servers help in providing efficient location management. It is shown that using forwarding pointers reduces the network load during updates, however, use of forwarding pointers may increase the search cost due to long chain lengths. We present two heuristics, namely, movement-based and call-based, to limit the length of the chain of forwarding pointers. It was observed that for most of the call-mobility patterns call-based heuristic performed better than the movement-based heuristic. A search-update occurs after a successful search, when the location information corresponding to the searched mobile host is updated at some hosts. This paper proposes various strategies for search-updates. It was noticed that performing search-updates significantly reduced the search costs with very little cost to pay for updates (upon moves and searches). fl Research reported is supported in part by AFOSR y Direct all correspondence to P.

Reference-contexts: Use of forwarding pointers to track decentralized objects was proposed by Fowler [7]. In our earlier work, we discussed location management schemes using forwarding pointers for network architectures consisting of a hierarchy of location servers and without designated home location servers <ref> [1] </ref>. In this paper we deal with network architectures in which there is a home location server (HLS) for every mobile host. Location management with home location servers have been earlier proposed in the literature [6, 11]. <p> A similar heuristic was proposed in [8] for a different network architecture. * Call-based : H LS update takes place whenever a call arrives. Therefore, H LS update will take place whenever a location search takes place. A similar approach was proposed in our earlier work <ref> [1] </ref> for a different network architecture. 3.2.2 Location Searches Let us suppose that a mobile host src wants to communicate with another mobile host dest. Please refer Figure 3 for this discussion. <p> A search-update occurs after a successful search, when the requesting host updates the location information corresponding to the mobile host. Search updates might reduce the search cost (call set-up time). The use of search updates have previously been discussed for network architectures without home location servers <ref> [1] </ref>. * No update : There are no search-updates. This is the case that has been analyzed till now. * Jump update : A location entry is created at the src ls for dest.

Reference-contexts: Cell splitting can then be used to increase the traffic handled in an area without increasing the bandwidth of the system. In future, the cells are expected to be very small (less than 10 meters in diameter) covering the interior of a building <ref> [2] </ref>. A mobile host communicates with one mobile support station (MSS) at any given time. MSS is responsible for forwarding data between the mobile host (mh) and static network. Cells are grouped into registration areas. There is a location server in each registration area.

Reference-contexts: Some of the proposed location management schemes assume location updates upon crossing cell boundaries. This is not a problem in a lightly loaded network, but it may be a significant problem in a high density environment <ref> [3] </ref>. In [3] it has been shown that if location updates were to occur on each cell crossing the resulting signalling load will have a major impact on the load of the network. <p> Some of the proposed location management schemes assume location updates upon crossing cell boundaries.

Reference-contexts: The motivation behind this kind of update is based on the assumption that src communicates frequently with dest. Therefore, the subsequent search by src for dest will be lower 3 . This approach is similar to the approach of caching location data <ref> [12] </ref>. * Path Compression update : The forwarding pointers in the chain of location servers are updated to point to curr ls. A location entry (e.g., a forwarding pointer) is also created at src ls. This kind of update is to be used for a highly searched host.
