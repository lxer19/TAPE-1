Abstract: Improved Non-approximability Results for Abstract. We provide new non-approximability results for the restrictions of the Min Vertex Cover problem to bounded-degree, sparse and dense graphs. We show that, for a sufficiently large B, the recent 16/15 lower bound proved by Bellare et al. [3] extends with negligible loss to graphs with bounded degree B. Then, we consider sparse graphs with no dense components (i.e. everywhere sparse graphs), and we show a similar result but with a better trade-off between non-approximability and sparsity. Finally we observe that the Min Vertex Cover problem remains APX-complete when restricted to dense graph and thus recent techniques developed by Arora et al. [1] for several Max SNP problems restricted to "dense" instances cannot be applied.

Reference-contexts: Until 1991, only a very few non-approximability results were known, usually with ad hoc techniques that did not generalize to other problems. In 1991, Feige et al. [10] showed that results about Probabilistic Checking of Proofs (PCP in short this terminology has been introduced later by Arora and Safra <ref> [2] </ref>) for NP languages imply non-approximability results for the Max Clique problem. Roughly speaking, the key ingredient of a proof checking system is a probabilistic polynomial-time oracle Turing machine (commonly called verifier) which, ?

Reference-contexts: Indeed, improved reductions yielded several recent breakthrough in approximability theory. Recent non-approximability results obtained via efficient reductions include Feige's tight result for Min Set Cover [9] and Bellare et al.'s results for Max Cut and Max Sat <ref> [3] </ref>. This paper follows the latter approach to investigate the approximability of the Min Vertex Cover problem with density constraints.

Bellare et al. [3] give a 1.0688 lower bound for the general Min Vertex Cover problem by using a different technique, namely, they reduce directly from the computation of a verifier using a somehow "complementary" version of the FLGSS reduction [10]. <p> Our results We provide a new characterization of the graphs resulting from the reduction from PCP verifiers to Min Vertex Cover <ref> [3] </ref>, and we show that such graphs can be seen as the union of bipartite complete graphs. We then give a construction of a particular kind of expanders (denoted as switchers). <p> It is worth noting that the best current non-approximability result for Max 3-Sat is about 1.038 <ref> [3] </ref>, while we can prove the Min Vertex Cover problem to be hard to 1.068-approximate over bounded-degree graphs. <p> We have to use the hypothesis that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse (actually, that NP 6 P/poly) because we use a non-uniform reduction. We also note that the reduction appeared in <ref> [3] </ref> can be slightly modified in order to show that the Min Vertex Cover problem is APX-complete even when restricted to dense graphs, and in particular to graphs with large minimum degree (thus, the "dense" restriction does not admit approximation schemes). <p> In particular, the Min Vertex Cover problem is APX-complete even when restricted to bounded-degree graphs [19, 16]. In which follows, we summarize the main definitions from the theory of probabilistically checkable proofs and its connections with the Min Vertex Cover problem. Our exposition follows <ref> [3] </ref>. A verifier is an oracle probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machine V . During its computation, V tosses random coins, reads its input and has oracle access to a string called proof. <p> The following theorem shows that the existence of efficient verifiers for any NP problem implies a non-approximability result for Min Vertex Cover. Theorem 5 Non-approximability of Min Vertex Cover <ref> [10, 3] </ref>. Let us assume that NP FPCP c;s [log; f; q]. Then, for any * &gt; 0, it is NP-hard to find (1 * + (c s)=(2 f c))-approximate solutions for the Min Vertex Cover problem. Sketch of the proof. <p> The best current non-approximability result for Min Vertex Cover is achieved by showing that NP FPCP 1;0:794 [log; 2; q] for a certain constant q <ref> [3] </ref>. This implies that it is NP-hard to 1.0688-approximate Min Vertex Cover. 3 Switchers As described in the Introduction, our technical goal is to replace complete bipartite graphs with sparse bipartite graphs which preserve a sufficiently good "connectivity" property. <p> We computed the non-approximability result for Min Steiner Tree that arises from <ref> [19, 5, 17, 3] </ref>, and it is about 1 + 1=5600. More generally, there is a linear relation between the hardness ratio that one can prove for the Max 3-Sat problem and the consequent hardness ratio implied for the Min Steiner Tree problem. <p> More generally, there is a linear relation between the hardness ratio that one can prove for the Max 3-Sat problem and the consequent hardness ratio implied for the Min Steiner Tree problem. On the other hand, our present results, combined with the best currently available verifier <ref> [3] </ref>, give a worse hardness ratio for the Min Steiner Tree problem, but the relation between the efficiency of the verifier and the hardness for Min Steiner Tree is superlinear, and thus better verifiers will imply a larger improvement for the hardness implied by our reduction than for that implied by

On the one hand, there have been several improvements in the efficiency of verifiers.

Due to lack of space, all the proofs are either sketched or omitted. Full details can be found in the extended version of this paper <ref> [8] </ref>. 2 Preliminaries Given a graph G (V; E), the Min Vertex Cover problem is to find a cover C of G (i.e. a subset C V such that C contains at least an endpoint of any edge in E) whose size (i.e. jCj) is as small as possible.
