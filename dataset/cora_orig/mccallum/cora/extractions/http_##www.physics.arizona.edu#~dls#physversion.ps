Abstract: In realistic disordered systems, such as the Edwards-Anderson (EA) spin glass, no order parameter, such as the Parisi overlap distribution, can be both translation-invariant and non-self-averaging. The standard mean-field picture of the EA spin glass phase can therefore not be valid in any dimension and at any temperature. Further analysis shows that, in general, when systems have many competing (pure) thermodynamic states, a single state which is a mixture of many of them (as in the standard mean-field picture) contains insufficient information to reveal the full thermodynamic structure. We propose a different approach, in which an appropriate thermodynamic description of such a system is instead based on a metastate, which is an ensemble of (possibly mixed) thermodynamic states. This approach, modelled on chaotic dynamical systems, is needed when chaotic size dependence (of finite volume correlations) is present. Here replicas arise in a natural way, when a metastate is specified by its (meta)correlations. The metastate approach explains, connects, and unifies such concepts as replica symmetry breaking, chaotic size dependence and replica non-independence. Furthermore, it replaces the older idea of non-self-averaging as dependence on the bulk couplings with the concept of dependence on the state within the metastate at

Reference-contexts: The above discussion leads naturally to the following possibility, first proposed in [26] as a possible candidate for the EA metastate, based in turn upon earlier work in <ref> [8] </ref>. Suppose that the EA spin glass has many pure states in some d and at some fi, but unlike in the mean-field picture each volume "sees" essentially only one pair at a time. <p> (periodic b.c.) metastate is dispersed over (infinitely) many 's, of the form = ff = 1 2 ff 2 ff It is interesting to note that just this type of behavior is observed for the many ground states of a simple highly disordered spin glass model in high dimension ( <ref> [8] </ref>; see also [80]). (Indeed, for the EA model itself, we would expect this type of behavior to occur at T = 0 if infinitely many ground states exist.) One can study metastates in models more complicated than those above, but still simpler than the EA spin glass, and a discussion <p> behavior to occur at T = 0 if infinitely many ground states exist.) One can study metastates in models more complicated than those above, but still simpler than the EA spin glass, and a discussion of some of these (e.g., random-field Ising models, the highly disordered spin glass of Ref. <ref> [8] </ref>, and the homogeneous XY model with random b.c.'s) appears in [49], to which the interested reader is referred for details. <p> It is interesting to note that this scenario actually arises in high dimensions in a highly disordered ground state model of spin glasses <ref> [8] </ref>. Finally, we discussed a maximal mean-field picture called the nonstandard SK picture.

Reference-contexts: Second, can such a P J (q) exhibit all the essential features of the SK picture, including those described by the four features above? The answers to these two parts, given in <ref> [25] </ref> are, respectively, yes and no. We will explain our construction of J (which is somewhat technical) and thus the "yes" answer to part one later in this section. <p> If property (2) is then eliminated as a realistic possibility, then one can also rule out property (4) of the SK picture, i.e., ultrametricity of all of the pure state overlaps for fixed J <ref> [25] </ref>. Consequently, we have proved that the standard SK picture cannot be valid in any dimension and at any temperature. This result goes beyond our specific construction of the Gibbs state J and overlap distribution P J , since any infinite-volume translation-invariant overlap distribution function would be self-averaging. <p> Here, one considers the joint distribution on the spins and the couplings; i.e., one considers the distribution -(J )fi (L) J ;fi on the periodic cube fl L <ref> [25] </ref>. Then (again using compactness arguments) some subsequence of L's converges to a limiting infinite-volume joint distribution (J ; ). <p> nonstandard SK picture, a continuum of pure states and their overlaps must be present; therefore, ultrametricity would not hold in general among any three pure states chosen at fixed J , unlike in the standard SK picture (see, for example, [56,57]). (The argument supporting this conclusion is presented in Ref. <ref> [25] </ref>.) Rather, the pure states at fixed J are split up into (a continuum of) families, where each family consists of those pure states occuring in the decomposition of a particular , and only within each such family would ultrametricity hold.

Reference-contexts: This scenario, which we have called the "standard SK picture" <ref> [26] </ref>, is the most straightforward extrapolation of the main features of the Parisi solution to infinite volume spin glasses in finite dimension and is presented in this section as a precise description of the usual presentations in the literature (see, for example, Refs. [2,29,42,72]). <p> In the next section, we go beyond the construction of a single limiting thermodynamic state by introducing the notion of metastates. V. CHAOTIC SIZE DEPENDENCE AND METASTATES In this section we will describe a new approach, introduced in Ref. <ref> [26] </ref>, to studying inhomogeneous and other systems with many competing pure states. This approach is 25 based on an analogy to chaotic dynamical systems, and involves the replacement of the study of a single thermodynamic state with an ensemble of (pure or mixed) thermodynamic states. <p> The above discussion leads naturally to the following possibility, first proposed in <ref> [26] </ref> as a possible candidate for the EA metastate, based in turn upon earlier work in [8]. Suppose that the EA spin glass has many pure states in some d and at some fi, but unlike in the mean-field picture each volume "sees" essentially only one pair at a time. <p> The replicas in infinite volume can be thought of as coupled through "boundary conditions at infinity". If this occurs, we say <ref> [26] </ref> that the system displays replica non-independence (RNI). The presence of RNI means that n J , which is a thermodynamic state for the uncoupled replica Hamiltonians, is not simply equal to the product of the individual Gibbs states J ( i ). <p> Otherwise, the product decomposition of n J is as a mixture over J . This also shows that RNI is equivalent to the non-interchangeability of the operations of taking replicas and the thermodynamic limit. In Ref. <ref> [26] </ref>, these points were explained using the idea of "metacorrelations". Just as 32 the usual correlations h i 1 i m i are moments (in this case, of order m) characterizing the thermodynamic state , metacorrelations are moments that characterize the metastate . <p> As noted in Ref. <ref> [26] </ref>, restriction to metacorrelations of order m = 1 yields J , to m 2 yields the two-replica measure 2 J ( 1 ; 2 ), which corresponds to "integrating out" all the other replicas in 1 J , and so on. <p> Applying these results to the EA model, we find that several scenarios for the metastate remain as logical possibilities in various dimensions and temperatures. One of course is the trivial paramagnetic phase. Another is the scaling/droplet model. Two other possibilities, mentioned in Ref. <ref> [26] </ref>, involve states consisting of a continuum of pure states; in one of these scenarios the metastate is dispersed and in the other it isn't, although both exhibit replica symmetry breaking. <p> However, we see no evidence that either of these apply to realistic spin glasses, and so do not discuss them further here. An intriguing new possibility, also discussed in Ref. <ref> [26] </ref>, is the chaotic pairs picture, which is different from both droplet/scaling and mean-field pictures.

Reference-contexts: There is another approach to constructing the metastate, due to Aizenman and Wehr <ref> [27] </ref>, which uses the randomness of the couplings directly, in a manner similar to that of the 27 construction of J in the previous section. <p> For specificity, consider the EA model with a (mean zero, variance one) Gaussian coupling distribution. Suppose that we change a finite number of couplings. The metastate J (), in addition to translation-covariance, is also covariant with respect to this change <ref> [27] </ref>; that is, the ensemble transforms (as would any probability measure) under a change of variables, ! 0 . Here, 0 is the thermodynamic state with correlations h A i 0 = h A e fiH i =he fiH i , where H is the change in the Hamiltonian.

Reference-contexts: 2 ) by spin flip symmetry considerations (and the fact that + and are the only pure states [73,74]), there is no guarantee for a spin glass that there is a well defined limit. (In fact, if such a limit does exist for the spin glass, one can then prove <ref> [28] </ref> that the same limiting state is obtained through the use of antiperiodic boundary conditions | a feature that already seems incompatible with an SK picture.) It is true that one can easily prove, using compactness arguments, convergence along 23 subsequences of L's for each J .

Reference-contexts: It should be noted however that there is some possibility of different behavior for periodic as opposed to, say, free boundary conditions <ref> [40] </ref>. We digress momentarily to discuss briefly two important points. The first is that, while the notion of an infinite volume (pure or mixed) state is well defined for nearest neighbor models, it is less so for systems with very long-ranged interactions, such as RKKY.

Reference-contexts: states exist.) One can study metastates in models more complicated than those above, but still simpler than the EA spin glass, and a discussion of some of these (e.g., random-field Ising models, the highly disordered spin glass of Ref. [8], and the homogeneous XY model with random b.c.'s) appears in <ref> [49] </ref>, to which the interested reader is referred for details. At this point, however, we will proceed and use the ideas introduced in this chapter to revisit the concepts of replica symmetry breaking and non-self-averaging, and will introduce some new concepts such as replica non-independence. <p> However, the weights which appear in Eq. (33) will in general change. Nevertheless, the overall overlap structure (i.e., the probability of appearance of a given set of weights and overlap locations) must remain invariant. We propose <ref> [49] </ref> this covariance property under coupling changes as an appropriate analogue to that of of dynamical systems having a probability measure invariant under the dynamics. Our reasoning is as follows. Suppose we consider free b.c.'s.

Reference-contexts: We will not discuss these issues here, but refer the reader to Ref. <ref> [79] </ref> for details. Our empirical distribution approach to construction of a metastate, based on CSD for fixed J , constructs J as the limit of (L) J , a type of microcanonical ensemble in which each of the finite volume states (1) (2) (L) J has weight L 1 .

Reference-contexts: is dispersed over (infinitely) many 's, of the form = ff = 1 2 ff 2 ff It is interesting to note that just this type of behavior is observed for the many ground states of a simple highly disordered spin glass model in high dimension ( [8]; see also <ref> [80] </ref>). (Indeed, for the EA model itself, we would expect this type of behavior to occur at T = 0 if infinitely many ground states exist.) One can study metastates in models more complicated than those above, but still simpler than the EA spin glass, and a discussion of some of

Reference-contexts: It seems more natural instead to take the two replicas from the same distribution, i.e., for a single L, and therefore from the same . As Guerra has pointed out <ref> [81] </ref>, this order of operations (in which replicas are taken before L ! 1) could yield a different result than that obtained by first letting L ! 1 to obtain an infinite volume state J and then taking replicas. <p> A crucial point, as emphasized by Guerra <ref> [81] </ref>, is that in the infinite volume replica measure n J , the replicas need not be independent , although they of course are independent in the finite volume measure n (L) J . The replicas in infinite volume can be thought of as coupled through "boundary conditions at infinity".

Reference-contexts: Rather, it would imply that the limit lim L!1 P (L) J does not exist; i.e., that P (L) J exhibits chaotic size dependence [82]. Our conclusion is that if overlap fluctuations (due to coupling dependence) don't vanish as L ! 1 <ref> [83] </ref>, this does not mean that the standard SK picture of overlap non-self-averaging holds; rather, it is a signal that the second kind of dependence holds for infinite volume. 34 With the new approach outlined above, a replacement for the standard SK picture sug-gests itself.
