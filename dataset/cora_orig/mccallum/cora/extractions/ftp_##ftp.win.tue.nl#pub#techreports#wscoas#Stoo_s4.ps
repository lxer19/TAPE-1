Abstract: A low gain design for linear discrete-time systems subject to input saturation was recently developed in [7,11,12] to solve both semi-global stabilization and semi-global output regulation problems. This paper proposes an improvement to the low gain design and determines controllers with the new design that achieve semi-global output regulation. The improvement is reflected in better utilization of available control capacity and consequently better closed-loop performance.

Reference-contexts: Without loss of generality, we have assumed that this neighborhood has a radius of 1 and, to ensure the existence of linear feedback regulators, we have also assumed that oe i is linear in this neighborhood. Following <ref> [1] </ref> for linear systems in the absence of input saturation, the semi-global linear feedback output regulation problem and semi-global linear observer based error feedback output regulation problem for linear systems subject to input saturation were first formulated in [10,12] as follows. Problem 2.1.

Reference-contexts: We should point out that the fundamental significance of the new design technique introduced here is due to the fact that it is of a semi-global nature.

In Section 2 we recall the problem formulation and the solvability conditions from [12].
