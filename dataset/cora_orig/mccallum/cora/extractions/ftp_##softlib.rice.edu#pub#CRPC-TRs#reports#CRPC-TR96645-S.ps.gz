Abstract: We consider a computational scheme for determining the linear stability of a diffusion model arising from the simulation of crystal growth. The process of a needle crystal solidifying into some undercooled liquid can be described by the dual diffusion equations with appropriate initial and boundary conditions. Here U l and U s denote the temperature of the liquid and solid respectively, and ff represents the thermal diffusivity. At the solid-liquid interface, the motion of the interface denoted by ~r and the temperature field are related by the conservation relation where ~n is the unit outward pointing normal to the interface. A basic stationary solution to this free boundary problem can be obtained by writing the equations of motion in a moving frame and transforming the problem to parabolic coordinate system. This is known as the Ivantsov parabola solution. Linear stability theory applied to this stationary solution gives rise to an eigenvalue problem of the form Accurate computation of these eigenvalues helps to determine interesting unstable modes that involve excitation of the interface. Analysis suggests that at least part of the spectrum corresponding to this eigenvalue problem is continuous and unbounded. In addition computation via standard methods such as QR becomes expensive when the mesh size of the discretization becomes small. We find however that IRAM is very efficient in extracting eigenvalues and eigenvectors of interest with modest cost. Numerical results will be presented to demonstrate the effectiveness this method. d~r

Reference-contexts: The Peclet number is set to be 0:1 in our computation. The experiment is performed on a SUN-SPARC 10. For coarse discretization up to about ~s = ~ t = 1=29, the results compared favorably to those obtained from the LAPACK <ref> [1] </ref>. As the matrix size increases, the computation becomes more expensive as indicated by a large number of matrix vector multiplications used. In the case ~s = ~ t = 1=99, IRAM did not converge in 300 iterations.
