Abstract: We examine the issue of duality both in electrodynamics and in Kalb-Ramond| scalar axion systems. In D spacetime dimensions the dual abelian theories of p1- and D p 1-form potentials have vacua classified by the dimensions of the cohomology spaces H p1 ( (D1) M) or H Dp1 ( (D1) M) respectively. The vacua are characterized by topological charges which are expectation values for generalized `Wilson loop' operators around non-trivial cycles. In certain instances the vacua exhibit a theta angle parametrization much as in QCD. The relation of axionic hair and discrete gauge hair is analyzed in the topologically massive Kalb-Ramond theory. If there are no fundamental strings in the theory, axionic charge is replaced by an irrelevant vacuum angle.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction It is a well-known fact that certain theories, among them gauge theories and abelian (and even non-abelian <ref> [1] </ref> ) scalar theories, admit description in terms of two different sets of potentials. The duality in these theories is the exchange of field equations and Bianchi identities. What is not well appreciated is that these theories are not identical. <p> W [] ! 1 as ! p: (3:8) For any continuous family of loops t one can show that the Wilson loops satisfy W <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> = exp i e o where = S t is the surface swept out by the family of curves t .

Reference-contexts: The duality in these theories is the exchange of field equations and Bianchi identities. What is not well appreciated is that these theories are not identical. The prop agating modes written in one of the potentials do have description <ref> [2] </ref> in terms of the dual potential, although the relation is non-local. It is precisely the vacua of the theories which differ. It is the vacuum properties of the theories which carry such information as Aharonov-Bohm phases and such exotic features as quantum hair.

Reference-contexts: It is the vacuum properties of the theories which carry such information as Aharonov-Bohm phases and such exotic features as quantum hair. Duality in terms of potentials is, in fact, another way of expressing the lattice duality which exchanges the strong and weak coupling regimes. <ref> [3] </ref> In the Ising model duality exchanges the spin lattice with its dual lattice. The present work is an attempt to clarify the issues of the vacua of theories dual to each other and to understand the subtle differences between the different kinds of quantum hair which have been proposed. <p> The Wilson surface 7 observable is just the axion charge enclosed by the surface: W [] = exp i o Generalized Wilson surfaces first appeared in the work of P. Orland, <ref> [3] </ref> as order-disorder parameters useful for distinguishing the phases in the continuum limit of abelian n form theories in D dimensions. Analyzing the axion system with the scalar potential, we need to find a topology with non-trivial two-forms, so let us excise a point p. <p> The issue of duality is interesting not only in four dimensions. Some time ago, Orland noted the equivalence of Hodge duality and duality in statistical mechanics <ref> [3] </ref> and was able to show that n th rank theories are disordered in D = n + 2 but not in D = n + 3 and higher. <p> Recently it has been argued that ten-dimensional strings are solitons in a theory of ten-dimensional five-branes and vice versa. [18] This duality is interesting for the reason that while string theory is believed to be strongly coupled, the five-brane theory, in agreement with ref. <ref> [3] </ref>, is weakly coupled. Thus, if a perturbation theory for five-branes can be constructed, it should be valid when string perturbation theory is not. It might be interesting to investigate one aspect of this duality; the "axion" in D = 10.

Reference-contexts: If the 8 end curves 0;1 are both points and the surface spanned by the curves encloses a monopole, then the Dirac quantization condition is the immediate consequence. 2n = e F = 4 e g: (3:10) Exactly analogous to the Dirac quantization condition is the quantization of axion charge <ref> [10] </ref> over a spatial slice 3 M = S 3 . The argument above is repeated with Wilson surfaces instead sweeping out the whole volume, starting from the center, r = 0, and ending at the point at infinity.

Reference-contexts: This is the origin of Z N quantum hair. This hair is different from axionic hair, which is the detection of a Wilson point by a Wilson surface. The existence of axionic hair is similarly unaffected by the mass of the the Kalb-Ramond gauge field. <ref> [16] </ref> 5.

Reference-contexts: Even though it is the vacua which are different, there can be dynamical consequences <ref> [17] </ref> of this inequivalence. Once there are charges coupling to the potentials in the theory, the issue of equivalence becomes more complicated. We avoided the issue of sources by excising regions from the spatial manifold and considering only the source-free equations on the remaining part.
