Title: UNSUPERVISED WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION RIVALING SUPERVISED METHODS  
Author: David Yarowsky 
Address: Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA  
Affiliation: Department of Computer and Information Science University of Pennsylvania  
Abstract: This paper presents an unsupervised learning algorithm for sense disambiguation that, when trained on unannotated English text, rivals the performance of supervised techniques that require time-consuming hand annotations. The algorithm is based on two powerful constraints that words tend to have one sense per discourse and one sense per collocation exploited in an iterative bootstrapping procedure. Tested accuracy exceeds 96%.

Reference-contexts: It thrives on raw, unannotated monolingual corpora the more the merrier. Although there is some hope from using aligned bilingual corpora as training data for supervised algorithms <ref> (Brown et al., 1991) </ref>, this approach suffers from both the limited availability of such corpora, and the frequent failure of bilingual translation differences to model monolingual sense differences.

Reference-contexts: A supervised algorithm based on this property is given in (Yarowsky, 1994). Using a decision list control structure based on <ref> (Rivest, 1987) </ref>, this algorithm integrates a wide diversity of potential evidence sources (lemmas, inflected forms, parts of speech and arbitrary word classes) in a wide diversity of positional relationships (including local and distant collocations, trigram sequences, and predicate-argument association).
