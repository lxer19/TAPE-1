Abstract: A circulant graph G of order n is a Cayley graph over the cyclic group Z n : Equivalently, G is circulant iff its vertices can be ordered such that the corresponding adjacency matrix becomes a circulant matrix. To each circulant graph we may associate a coherent configuration A and, in particular, a Schur ring S isomorphic to A. A can be associated without knowing G to be circu-lant. If n is prime, then by investigating the structure of A either we are able to find an appropriate ordering of the vertices proving that G is circulant or we are able to prove that a certain necessary condition for G being circulant is violated. The algorithm we propose in this paper is a recognition algorithm for cyclic association schemes. It runs in time polynomial in n. fl The work reported in this paper has been partially supported by the German Israel Foundation for Scientific Research and Development under contract # I-0333-263.06/93

Reference-contexts: 5 If is any set of binary relations defined on X; then by (X; hi) we denote the minimal coherent configuration (X; ) satisfying the property: 2 Rel (): Such a configuration is unique and may be found by the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm in time O (jXj 3 log (jXj)) (see <ref> [BBLT97] </ref>). A version of this algorithm with much higher time-complexity, but nevertheless very efficient in the range up to n = 1000, is presented in [BCKP97].

For this reason we shall call a cyclic coherent configuration a cyclic association scheme. Proposition 3.5 Let (X; ) be a non-trivial cyclic association scheme and let g 2 Aut () be a full cycle.
