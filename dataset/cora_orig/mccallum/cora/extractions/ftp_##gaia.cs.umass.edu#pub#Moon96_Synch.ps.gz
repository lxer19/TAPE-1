Title: Synchronized Two-way Voice Simulation Tool for Internet Phone Performance Analysis and Evaluation

Abstract: A simulation tool is developed for the performance analysis and evaluation of Internet phone applications. The tool can be used offline to simulate real two-way phone conversations under different Internet loss and delay conditions. The simulation model includes access links that connect an Internet service provider to the Internet, as well as background Internet phone and data traffic. It also includes details of Internet phone implementations such as encoding, packetization, silence detection, and the IP, UDP, and RTP protocols. An original feature of the simulator is that it takes into account explicitly the synchronization of talkspurts in a two-way conversation. Example results of two-way conversations under various delay and loss conditions are provided in audio files. Pointers to download the files are at http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/~sbmoon/synch.html.

Reference-contexts: Of course, the simulator has certain limitations since it cannot capture how delay and loss affects the information content (e.g. extra interruptions and repetitions due to excessive delay) in a two-way interaction. The idea for the two-way simulation technique was inspired by <ref> [BRA2] </ref>, where an analytical Markov model is developed for talkspurt generation in a two-way voice conversation. This model is a generalization of the one-way twostate Markov model that has been adopted almost invariably in analytical packet voice studies to date (see, for example, [DAI,GRU,HEF,LEE,SRI]).

Reference-contexts: The determination of the loss and delay limits for telephony of a reasonable quality over the Internet is not a simple problem. For circuitswitched voice, the maximum tolerable delay is well known to be 400ms or less <ref> [ITU] </ref>. This delay limit is dependent on the end-to-end delay that can be tolerated before a voice conversation becomes awkward. It also depends on the limits that can be handled by echo cancellers.

The present main attractive feature of Internet phone is that there are basically no direct charges associated with the calls that are made. One can use it to make local, long-distance, or international phone calls between computers on the Internet without any significant service charges.

Reference-contexts: The number of samples in a frame depends on the packetization interval D that is selected. This parameter is a software variable that can be adjusted in our simulation tool. In <ref> [JAY] </ref>, it is recommended that D be set in the range of 16 to 30ms. In the experiments that we have carried out so far, we have used D = 20ms. Note that nevot uses D = 20ms.

Reference-contexts: In order to synchronize the clocks on the two Suns, we use NTP [MIL1]. This protocol provides clock synchronization to within a few tens of milliseconds <ref> [MIL2] </ref> in the Internet of today. The procedure is then to record the voice signals on both sides using the modified version of nevot and then delete the timestamps and a part of one of the audiofiles so that the voice samples of the two speakers are synchronized.

Reference-contexts: Logical Block Diagram and Model Parameters The complete simulation model depicted in Fig. 1 has been programmed in C. We make use of C subroutines from SIMUL <ref> [SCH1] </ref> that simplify the construction of the discrete-event simulation program. Subroutines from SIMUL are also used to gather performance statistics such as the delay and loss at the finite buffer FIFO queues. A logical block diagram of the simulation tool is illustrated in Fig. 5.

Reference-contexts: Details that now need to be considered include the packetization period, Internet architecture, protocol stack overheads of IP, UDP, and RTP <ref> [SCH4] </ref>, silence/talkspurt detection algorithms, playout delay adjustment algorithms, encoding and compression schemes, and error recovery mechanisms. To evaluate the delay and loss limits for different parameter settings, it is necessary to evaluate the voice quality under a multitude of scenarios. This should be done in a controlled experiment. <p> Each frame that is to be packetized for transmission is sent in an individual packet. To this data, we add a 20 octet IP header, an 8 octet UDP header, and a 12 octet RTP header <ref> [SCH4] </ref>, as illustrated in Fig. 3. This is the packetization procedure that is followed in nevot . With D = 20ms and 64Kbps 8-bit PCM, the protocol overhead is 20%. By modifying the packetization process, we can also consider other protocol stack implementations in our simulation.

Reference-contexts: The talkspurts are then packetized, as in Section 3. Hangover packets and cached packets are also added in, as in Section 3. In the Markov model, the talkspurt and silence periods are independent and exponentially distributed. The mean talkspurt and silence lengths are 352ms and 650ms, respectively <ref> [SRI] </ref>. The subroutine generates the packet process for each source, superimposes the resulting packet streams, and then presents the aggregate phone traffic to the FIFO queue. We use separate and independent background Internet phone traffic generators for each FIFO queue.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, the perceived quality of the voice communication is variable. Measurements on routes indicate that end-to-end Internet packet losses can be quite high [BOL,SAN]. Losses in the range of 30 - 50% are not atypical <ref> [YAJ] </ref>. The delay is also quite variable, depending not only on the existing traffic but also on the number of routers and firewalls that may be traversed. When the conditions are favorable, however, near toll quality can be reached.
