Abstract: Given the vast amount of information available to the average person, there is a growing need for mechanisms that can select relevant or useful information based on some specification of the interests of a user. Furthermore, experience with natural language understanding and reasoning programs in artificial intelligence has demonstrated that the combinatorial explosion of possible conclusions that can be drawn from any input is a serious computational bottleneck in the design of computer programs that process information automatically. This paper presents a theory of interestingness that serves as the basis for two story understanding programs, one that can filter and extract information likely to be relevant or interesting to a user, and another that can formulate and pursue its own interests based on an analysis of the information necessary to carry out the tasks it is pursuing. We discuss the basis for our theory of interestingness, heuristics for interest-based processing of information, and the process used to filter and extract relevant information from the input.

Reference-contexts: This idea has been explored in the PIES program. The basic process of understanding used in PIES is similar to conventional script-based or MOP-based understanding programs (e.g., <ref> [Cullingford, 1978; DeJong, 1979; Schank, 1982] </ref>). However, PIES understands its input from the point of view of the user.

Reference-contexts: This is a functional approach to the problem of interestingness [Hidi and Baird, 1986; Schank, 1979]. The theory is related to the goal satisfaction principle of <ref> [Hayes-Roth and Lesser, 1976] </ref>, which states that more processing should be given to knowledge sources whose responses are most likely to satisfy processing goals, and to the relevance principle of [Sperber and Wilson, 1986], which states that humans pay attention only to information that seems relevant to them.

Reference-contexts: A system with no goals would have no reason to find any input more interesting than any other, nor would any particular piece of information be universally interesting for all systems unless they shared the same goals. This is a functional approach to the problem of interestingness <ref> [Hidi and Baird, 1986; Schank, 1979] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Our ideas are consistent with psychological research on goal direction in focus of attention, particularly from social psychology (e.g., see Zukier's [1986] review), and with empirical results on active and goal-oriented learning in teaching situations (e.g., knowledge-building goals <ref> [Ng and Bereiter, 1991] </ref>). Although our model is cognitively inspired, the functional justification for the theory is based on computational arguments. There are practical benefits of a program that can represent and reason about its knowledge goals and interests.

Reference-contexts: One might think of this as a process of question transformation, in which the reasoner generates questions which then trigger, or get transformed into, other questions. Thus one major aspect of understanding is the ability to plan to look for, retrieve, or infer information that might be relevant <ref> [Ram and Hunter, 1991] </ref>. Some knowledge goals arise from an intellectual need to find information, such as the need to determine the religion of a suicide bomber for the purposes of determining the applicability of the religious fanatic explanation in a given story about terrorism.

Reference-contexts: New tasks can give rise to new knowledge goals, which are suspended along with the tasks if answers are not yet known and cannot be inferred. An example of such a system is the AQUA (Asking Questions and Understanding Answers) program <ref> [Ram, 1987; Ram, 1989] </ref>. AQUA is a dynamic story understanding program that is driven by its questions or goals to acquire knowledge. Rather than being canned, the program is always changing as its questions change; it reads similar stories differently and forms different interpretations as its questions and interests evolve.

Reference-contexts: In other words, the understander must be able to remember what it needs to know, and why. This need to know forms the basis of our theory of knowledge goals <ref> [Ram, 1989; Ram, 1990] </ref>. In addition to representing its goals for acquiring knowledge, the understander must be able to use these goals to guide and focus the process of information gathering. <p> New tasks can give rise to new knowledge goals, which are suspended along with the tasks if answers are not yet known and cannot be inferred.
