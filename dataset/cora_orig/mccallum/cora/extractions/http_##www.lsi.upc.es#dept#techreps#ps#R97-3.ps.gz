Abstract: This paper reports on solving geometric constraint satisfaction problems involving incidence and tangency constraints in 2D. A variational geometric constraint solver based on a constructive approach is used: the main goal is to keep the present set of rules as small as possible. Defining tangency conditions as distance and angle constraints allows solving fixed radius configurations. Non-fixed radius schemes are also characterized and a new set of constructive rules is proposed.

Reference-contexts: They are based on the fact that most configurations in an engineering drawing are solvable using a rather small set of tools like ruler, compass and protractor. Constructive solvers can be based either on rewriting rules [2, 13] or on constraint graph analysis <ref> [1, 12, 10] </ref>. Our group has built a variational geometric constraint solver based on a constructive approach [7]. It computes a solution in two phases. First, using rewriting rules, the solver builds a sequence of construction steps without the need of arranging the set of constraints in a predefined order.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, some care must be taken when determining the number of constraints that consistently define GCSP's when arcs and circles are involved. More general than Laman's theorem, although not sufficient, is Grubler's condition <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Besides diferent concrete realizations caused by reflexions <ref> [4] </ref>, each tangency constraint between circles provide two diferent solutions (see figure 2). Depending on the relative position of the centers, the given circle can be contained within the solution circle or lie outside. 4.

Reference-contexts: Some tangency and incidence constraints introduce symbolic dimensions that may be determined by computing geometric relations from a partially completed construction. A solver based on a hybrid approach is a combination of several methods mentioned in section 1. A hybrid geometric constraint solver supporting symbolic constraints is described in <ref> [6] </ref>. This work reports on a technique to enhance constructive geometric constraint solvers with the capability of managing functional relationships between dimension variables. Essentially, it is a purely geometric constraint solver communicated bi-directionally with an equational solver. <p> On the other hand, any circle defined by three symbolic constraints can be translated into a system of three quadratic equations, with the coordinates of the center point and the value of the radius as the unknowns. The hybrid solver in <ref> [6] </ref>, can switch to numeric methods to compute the position of the center point and the radius dimension. <p> Since the solver already has 18 construction rules, that means to nearly double the number of rules in the geometric constraint solver. The hybrid solver described in <ref> [6] </ref> considers 2D geometric constraint problems involving constraints with fixed value as well as constraints with symbolic value. The technique used deals with two sets of data: the geometric constraint data, represented by a set of clusters, and the symbolic equation data, described by a bigraph. <p> The correctness of the analyser for the currently available set of rules has been established in [7]. Adding propagation rules to the constructive solver would imply proving termination again. The correctness of the analyser in the hybrid solver has been shown in <ref> [6] </ref>. All these considerations lead us to choose the geometric constraint solver based on a hybrid approach to solve variable radii configurations involving arcs or circles on the plane. 5 Conclusions This work has reported on the use of circles in geometric constraint satisfaction problems.

Reference-contexts: CD, CA and CH sets are combined into larger CD sets if they pairwise share a single geometric element. Merging CX sets require rigid body motions.

Reference-contexts: The graph realization problem is that of computing the relative locations of a set of vertices placed in Euclidean space, relying only upon some set of inter-vertex constraints.

A constraint graph is a simple, undirected and finite graph consisting of nodes representing geometries and pairwise edges corresponding to the equations between each two constraint geometries <ref> [12] </ref>. In GCSP, the primary interest is not in graphs, but rather in their concrete realizations in some Euclidean space. The graph realization problem is that of computing the relative locations of a set of vertices placed in Euclidean space, relying only upon some set of inter-vertex constraints.
