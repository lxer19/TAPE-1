Abstract: While the effects of time pressure on decision-making have been studied relatively extensively , the effects of a concurrent memory load have not. This paper presents a study of the effects of both time pressure and concurrent memory load on a static judgment task from the perspective of the lens model. Previous results indicating that time pressure results in less cognitive control and utilization of fewer cues was replicated, though negative bias was not. There was an effect of concurrent memory load which was not the same as that of time pressure. Concurrent memory load also decreased cue utilization, but did not affect cognitive control. Further work is necessary to more clearly understand the difference between time pressure and concurrent tasks.

Reference-contexts: These effects were replicated on a similar task involving personal investment by Wright and Weitz (1977). Another effect of time pressure is the reduction of what has been termed cognitive control <ref> (Dudycha & Naylor, 1966) </ref>, which is the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) between cues and judgments. In a study on line-length prediction, Rothstein (1986) found that time pressure had a significant detrimental effect on cognitive control.

Reference-contexts: Negative bias has been replicated by Wright and Weitz (1977) and Svenson and Edland (1987). However, in a choice task where subjects had incomplete information about the values on all attributes, this effect was not observed and, in fact, a positive bias was found <ref> (Svenson, Edland, & Slovic, 1990) </ref>. So, while evidence for the other ef fects of time pressure have been fairly well-established, an effect for information valence is tentative.

Reference-contexts: RESULTS The data for each subject was analyzed via multiple regression of the judgment responses on the cue values for each application. However, unlike other lens-style work <ref> (e.g. Wright, 1974) </ref>, not all cues were simultaneously entered into the regression equation. Instead, a forward selection procedure was used to determine more precisely how many (and which) cues were necessary to predict responses.
