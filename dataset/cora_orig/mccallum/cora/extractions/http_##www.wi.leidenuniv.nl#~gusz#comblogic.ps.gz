Title: Combining algebraizable logics  
Author: A.Janossy, A.Kurucz, A.E.Eiben 
Date: March 19, 1996  
Abstract: In this paper we translate the "combining logics" problem to the problem of "combining" certain theories of usual first order logic. We prove that the category of a special class of logics, called algebraizable logical systems (see Def. 1.1 below), is isomorphic to the category of the corresponding first order theories. We also show that these categories are cocomplete. Some directions in which the approach chosen can perhaps be generalized are pointed out in the last section.

DEFINITION 1.1 A pair L = hCn (L); o L i is called an algebraizable logical system iff Cn (L) is an algebraic similarity type and o L is a binary relation between sets of Cn (L)-type terms and Cn (L)-type terms, satisfying conditions (1-6) below. <p> Other examples (also for non-algebraizable logical systems) can be found in e.g. Blok-Pigozzi [4], Andreka et al <ref> [2] </ref>, [3], [14]. <p> Blok-Pigozzi [4], Ch.5.2.4 for an example. The following "back and forth" theorem establishes the basic connection between a logic L and its algebraic (i.e., usual first order) "translation" Alg (L). THEOREM 1.5 (cf. Blok-Pigozzi [4] Thms.2.4, 4.7, 4.10 and Andreka et al <ref> [2] </ref> Thm.3.2.1) Let L be an algebraizable logical system, and let h"; ffi; i be an algebraizator for L. <p> 2 [ f ^ h (f (x 0 ; : : : ; x k1 )) = ^g (f (x 0 ; : : : ; x k1 )) : f 2 dom (t 1 ) k-aryg K = M od t 2 (Ax): Claim 4.2.2 hht 2 ; K; <ref> [" 2 ; ffi 2 ; 2 ] </ref> K i; [[id A 2 ]]i is the colimit of E.

Second, let A def = ht 2 ; K; <ref> [" 2 ; ffi 2 ; 2 ] </ref> K i and take an object A 0 def = ht 0 ; K 0 ; [" 0 ; ffi 0 ; 0 ] K 0 i of QVAR and some [[|]] 2 M or QVAR (A 2 ; A 0 ) with <p> An even more ambitious task is to develop the category theoretic "reconstruction" of combining logics which are given not merely with their consequence relations but also together with their semantics.

Reference-contexts: 1 Preliminaries As a set theoretic framework we presume any set theory which is suitable for the foundation of category theory. For basic category theoretical notions such as category, object, morphism, small diagram, cocone, coproduct, colimit, coequalizer, etc. we follow the usage of MacLane <ref> [10] </ref>.

For notions not defined but used here, see e.g. Monk [11], Burris-Sankappanavar [6]. ! denotes the set of natural numbers. An algebraic similarity type is a function t mapping some nonempty set into !. <p> We have proved that ALOG and QVAR are isomorphic categories. 4 Cocompleteness THEOREM 4.1 QVAR is a small-cocomplete category (i.e., all small colimits exist in it). The proof uses the following lemma. Lemma 4.2 (cf. e.g. MacLane <ref> [10] </ref>, p.109) If a category has all coequalizers and all small coproducts then it is small-cocomplete. Proof of Lemma 4.2. Here we give the sketch of the proof in order to illustrate that colimits in general are indeed "computable" if coequalizers and coproducts are given. <p> A2M and hO 1 ; i B mi A2M;B2Obj D ;m2Mor D (A;B) induce two morphisms f and g from O 2 to O 1 .

We give the small coproducts and the coequalizers in category QVAR.
