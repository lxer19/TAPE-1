Title: Usability Enhancements to MediaBoard a Shared Whiteboard Application  
Author: Teck-Lee Tung 
Date: December 17, 1997  
Abstract: MediaBoard is a shared drawing tool for the MBone. We used an early version of it in weekly sessions for a class with some participants being physically remote. From user feedback and observations, we identified key areas that require improvements. This paper describe the experiences and issues that we encountered and the enhancements we made to MediaBoard to improve its effectiveness. These include introducing zooming, loading and saving, adding banner indicators to identify user activities, mechanisms to automatically track page switching, and a novel mechanism for online browsing of content history.

Reference-contexts: One common component of such collaboration support systems is a shared whiteboard that enables participants to share common drawing spaces. MediaBoard <ref> [1] </ref> is one such shared whiteboard application. MediaBoard is inspired by its predecessor, [2] and many of its features are derived from it. The goal of the application is not only to replace but also subsume the role of the conventional whiteboard in meeting rooms. <p> Once connected to a session, each participant would be able to draw items (lines, texts, images, etc . . . ) on the screen and made modifications. To allow logical division of a collaboration session, the drawing space is being subdivided into multiple pages. In the work described in <ref> [1] </ref>, we implemented an early prototype for MediaBoard and has since been making continued enhancements to the application. <p> Irrespective of the network condition, we want to achieve the goal of eventual consistency. This means that at any instance of time, assuming that all lost packets have been recovered, each MediaBoard instance will display the same state. 2.2 Previous Work and Deployment In previous work described in <ref> [1] </ref>, we implemented an early prototype for MediaBoard. The basic mechanisms of MediaBoard were in place and it ran on a variety of platforms including Microsoft Windows and various variants of UNIX. We used the application in weekly meetings for a class about "CSCW using CSCW tools".

Reference-contexts: and conclusion respectively in Section 9 and Section 10. 2 Background In this section we describe the main goals of Me-diaBoard and what has been done prior to work described in this document. 2.1 Goals MediaBoard is part of a suite of tools built on top of the MASH toolkit <ref> [3] </ref>. The main aim is to provide a shared drawing space for a group of participants using computers connected to each other over the MBone.

Reference-contexts: The main aim is to provide a shared drawing space for a group of participants using computers connected to each other over the MBone. Specifically, we have the following goals in mind when designing the tool. 2.1.1 Being There and Beyond In <ref> [4] </ref>, Hollan and Stornetta described how the goal of pursuing the goal of being there by imitating face-to-face communications when designing CSCW tools is problematic and suggested an alternative for grounding and motivating research and development by framing the issue in terms of needs, media and mechanisms, thus aiming to be

Reference-contexts: Since participants tend to have different display devices and network capabilities, we also want MediaBoard to have mechanisms that deal with heterogeneous environments. 2.1.3 Reliability and Scalability MediaBoard should be able to cope with problems in the computer network like packet losses and reordering. It uses IP multicast <ref> [5] </ref> over the Internet multicast backbone (MBone). This results in savings of network bandwidth since a single packet need only be sent once to all participating hosts in a session, as opposed to the case were multiple point-to-point connections is used to send a single packet multiple times.

Reference-contexts: However, the basic multicast model has no notion of reliability, and losses are not uncommon in the Internet. Therefore, Media-Board uses the Scalable, Reliable Multicast Protocol (SRM, <ref> [6] </ref>) to disseminate its application state. SRM provides a light weight mechanism allowing applications to recover lost packets using little network bandwidth. For robustness, the application is designed to be completely distributed and keeps complete history for all past drawing operations sent and received.

Reference-contexts: The class meets for 2 hour long sessions weekly and lasted 14 weeks. Each week, students took turns to give presentations on class materials. There were usually about 8 to 15 people in a conference room called CoLab equipped with a LiveBoard <ref> [7] </ref> | a computer with Usability Enhancements to MediaBoard | a Shared Whiteboard Application 3 a large 67-inch LCD screen and pen based input, computers with video capturing capabilities, remote controllable cameras and TV monitors. Participants also took turns to attend the class remotely from desktop workstations.

Reference-contexts: As such, the sense of presence is lost and the sense of awareness is much reduced. In this section, we describe ways to improve awareness and presence. 4.1 Injecting Tele-presence In <ref> [8] </ref>, tele-presence is described as "a way of giving distributed participants a feeling that they are in the same meeting room". <p> He noted that: * hand gestures are a significant re source for communicating information; * the process of creating and using drawings conveys important information not found in the result drawings; In MediaBoard we don't support tele-pointers which shows the location of the mouse cursor on all participants' screens (e.g. <ref> [8] </ref>). The main reason for this is that we wanted MediaBoard to scale well to large sessions and tele-pointers require a significant amount of bandwidth per user (See Section 8). Instead users tend to use freehand markings to convey gestures like pointing at an object. <p> In such cases, participants have to use other relaying technologies like MeGa [25]. The use of cursors to mark different participants when there is an activity is inspired by another CSCW application, the Network Text Editor (NTE, [26]). GroupDraw and GroupSketch described in <ref> [8] </ref> also employs user cursors showing the user's name.

Reference-contexts: Most of the research Usability Enhancements to MediaBoard | a Shared Whiteboard Application 4 in improving tele-presence within the context of shared drawing intermix the video images of participants with the shared drawing space. One example is ClearBoard <ref> [9] </ref> in which special equipment is used to emulate the metaphor of drawing through a glass window. In our work, we aim to make Me-diaBoard suitable for use in a wide range of situations. <p> Another suggested using a history log to represent activities and have a way to go to a specific entry from the history log. 8 Related Work Related work described in the literature regarding shared drawing tools includes VideoDraw [20], ClearBoard <ref> [9] </ref>, TeamWorkStation [21], Commune [22]. There are a few major differences between these applications and MediaBoard _ All of the above applications are designed for use within a local area network.

Reference-contexts: Also, when there were simultaneous activities, there would be no way to tell who is responsible for which activity. Since support for simultaneous activities is regarded as one of the chief advantages of computer supported shared drawing tools over conventional whiteboards <ref> [10] </ref>, there is clearly a need to solve this problem as well. In the new version of MediaBoard, we introduce additional "tool-tips" like banner windows that are displayed next to the location of activities. This is illustrated in Figure 2. <p> The checkbox on the bottom left toggles on and off the original mechanism of following new activities. Checking on any of the "track" check-boxes turns off the "follow activity" checkbox and vice versa. 5 Reviewing a Session In <ref> [10] </ref>, Tang studied the work activity of small groups using wall mounted whiteboards and large paper sheets. <p> However, we feel that the goal of injecting sufficient tele-presence is still not fully met and is a subject of open research. Initial feedback from users about these new features are positive. As described in <ref> [10] </ref>, the research approach towards designing and implementing of collaborative tools is a iterative one, consisting of the three main steps of observe, Understand and support in each iteration. What we have described is one such iteration cycle.

Reference-contexts: We discovered from this trial that the banners can be distracting. Therefore, we made it possible to turn this feature off and also suppressed display of these banners for items drawn by the local user. Also considered but not yet implemented is a Magic Lens <ref> [11] </ref> like window which displays all the banners under it. 4.2.2 Inter-page awareness In the previous version of MediaBoard the only page switching mechanism available is a mode whereby MediaBoard will automatically switch to a page that has a new activity.

Reference-contexts: A person joining a session late has no means of figuring out what took place during the session since all he or she sees is the latest state. The MASH suite of collaboration tools also come with archiving and playback applications <ref> [12] </ref> that are able to provide synchronized playback of video, audio and MediaBoard streams. It also supports random seek to positions within the stream during playback. However, MediaBoard treats all data as being persistent and did not have any mechanisms to rewind to the previous state.

Reference-contexts: Future versions of MediaBoard will mostly likely to use a custom developed MBCanvas object that is independent of Tk and provides just enough functionality we need. 6.3 Time-browsing To perform well in presence of losses and reordering of datagram packets, MediaBoarduses the Application Level Framing <ref> [19] </ref> model. Each operation of drawing items in MediaBoard is translated into one or more Application Data Units (ADU's) and sent over the network.

For example, it can be replaced by a small still or moving video image of the person, or by comic like avatars that can perform simple gestures <ref> [27] </ref>. A feature that we would like to try out is: using thumb-nails to show miniature views of the canvas, as found in BoardNoter [28]. It should be relatively simple to implement this function given that we already have the ability to zoom canvas pages to different scales.
