Title: A Method for Image Reconstruction with Noisy Side Image and Variance-Corrected Weights  
Author: Robinson Piramuthu 
Date: January 06, 1998  
Abstract: In this report, we present a Bayesian reconstruction method based on locally correlated Gaussian Markov random field priors. We focus on 2-dimensional functional imaging with prior information derived from anatomical MRI images of the same slice. We use a modified penalized maximum likehood (PML) objective, where the Emission Computed Tomography (ECT) statistics is incorporated in the ML term, as usual, and the MRI statistics appear in the quadratic penalty term through the variance-corrected weights extracted from the observed noisy MRI image. The penalty term using these weights enforces smoothness constraints everywhere in the image except across the boundary of region of interest (ROI), thus resulting in a spatially-varying penalty. This set of variance-corrected weights is more robust to MRI noise, when compared to an earlier method using variance-uncorrected weights which ignores the uncertainty in the MRI boundary estimates. This uncertainty increases as the SNR in the MRI image decreases. The MRI boundary is parametrized by B-splines and these parameters are estimated by the ML approach. The variance-uncorrected weights are extracted using these parameters. The variance-corrected weights are then obtained by a smoothing operation on the variance-uncorrected weights using a limiting form of posterior distribution of MRI parameters and which depends on the ML estimate of the B-spline parameters. This smoothing operation is independent of the unknown ECT emission distribution and hence can be done o*ine from the ECT reconstruction. We compare these two methods on the basis of bias and standard deviation of both mean and total estimates of activity in the ROI and on the basis of root mean-squared error. We also present how we can extend this technique when the center of ROI is unknown and the boundary of ROI need not be continuous in 2-D (as in the brain) and whose topology can vary (since we focus on functional imaging). For this purpose, we propose to use the numerical algorithms called Propagation of Surfaces under Curvature (PSC) so that we can also extend this to 3-dimensions for future work. This report is submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Reference-contexts: If we were to include the MRI statistics, then we have to choose ^ that minimizes the maximum error probability. Therefore we get the following min-max estimation rule ^ = arg min ae oe ; for small *: (5.3) Using the techniques in <ref> [1] </ref>, we can show that the above is equivalent to ^ = arg min Z P (ki k &gt; *) ~ f () d (5.4) where ~ f () is a function of and is called the equalizer density. This equalizer density can be derived using a related integral equation.

Reference-contexts: We also sample the angle OE uniformly in <ref> [0; 2] </ref> to get n points. Let r 2 &lt; n + denote the radial distance of the boundary at the different angular samples. We can think of this as a sampled version of r . <p> In particular, the point spread function (PSF) of a two-dimensional SPECT system is shift-variant and is not stationary; whereas, the PSF of a three-dimensional ECT system is more stationary and is only slightly affected by the object-to-collimator distance. The RMS error and contrast analysis in <ref> [2] </ref> show that the performance of fully three-dimensional imaging techniques is better than two-dimensional restoration techniques. Hence, volumetric reconstruction schemes are preferred to slice reconstruction for their fidelity and accuracy.

Reference-contexts: Some of the well-known models used to represent boundary are autore-gressive models, Fourier descriptors, fitting of line segments, cubics, Bezier curves <ref> [4] </ref>, Beta-splines and B-splines. In this report, we have used quadratic B-splines, as in [31], to parametrize the boundary. In general, m-th order B-splines are piecewise polynomial functions of degree m over fixed interval lengths. The boundary between intervals is termed a knot.

Reference-contexts: There are several variations of this technique. In the context of boundary extraction of ROI in the MRI image, we can estimate the radial distance function of the boundary directly in polar coordinates, relative to the known center of ROI. This can be obtained by Canny <ref> [5] </ref> or Marr-Hildreth [24] edge detection which use gradient operators on the image along x and y directions, and then smooth the extracted edge by a median filter, to make it less sensitive to shot-noise.

Reference-contexts: Once we obtain the side image, we can derive the side weights using a suitable weight mapping scheme and then incorporate these weights into the PML objective and improve the uptake estimates. This PSC scheme will be used for 3-dimensional imaging as in <ref> [6] </ref>, to extract side information from MRI data. 26 The next step will be to find the CR bound for this active surface and then obtain the variance-corrected weights in order to obtain a robust uptake estimate.

Reference-contexts: In slice reconstruction schemes, two-dimensional images of cross-sections/slices of the object are first reconstructed. Since the interresolution between cross-sections is less than the interresolution within each cross-section, interpolations between slices are required to obtain a three-dimensional image for visualization. There are several linear and nonlinear interpolation schemes <ref> [7] </ref> for this purpose. On the other hand, volumetric or fully three-dimensional reconstruction schemes implement inversion of the three-dimensional Radon transform. Volumetric reconstruction methods perform better than slice reconstruction methods because they take into consideration the interslice information.

Reference-contexts: This estimate of r is constrained to be in the span of the spline basis. So, to get a more general bound on covariance of curve samples in the span of the B-spline basis, we should use a constrained CR bound [31].

We demonstrated the improvement in performance for a hot-spot phantom, when we used variance corrected weights. Similar results <ref> [15] </ref> were obtained for a cold-spot phantom. It remains to try this technique to more complex shapes and for 3-dimensional images. We will discuss about these in the next section. 7.

To limit spurious numerical oscillations across discontinuties, which could limit accuracy and prevent convergence towards steady solutions, appropriate discretization schemes should be used. In <ref> [23] </ref>, the constant advection component is approximated using upwind schemes and the curvature dependent component is approximated by central differences. The upwind differencing schemes attempt to discretize hyperbolic partial differential equations by using differencing based on the direction determined by the sign of the characteristic speeds. <p> For demonstration of the PSC scheme using level set approach, let us refer to figure (7.2). This result is presented 8 in <ref> [23] </ref>. This figure shows the evolution of the front at various times. The curve is made to evolve outwards. We emphasize that we do not require that the center of the ROI or the number of branches to be known. <p> In this case, the curve develops sharp protrusions as it evolves. A complete set of results is presented in <ref> [23] </ref> where, after 1500 iterations, the evolving curve captures the entire map of the boundary. It is claimed in that paper that the algorithm is fast and an even faster algorithm is proposed in [22].

Reference-contexts: This also, means that we will have difficulty in tracking the boundary of a topologically varying ROI. This motivates us to use the principles of Propagation of Surfaces under Curvature (PSC) <ref> [28] </ref> for our future work. This method is now becoming popular in the field of image segmentation. In this set-up, we can easily extend our boundary extraction to 3-dimensional images. This also leaves the evaluation of CR bound to be an open problem. <p> The front in this case is the interface between the solid and fluid region. The speed would depend on the temperature of water close to the surface and the heat transfer inside and outside the cube. PSC algorithms based on Hamilon-Jacobi formulations are presented in <ref> [28] </ref>. PSC schemes are presently used for recovering shapes of objects in two and three dimensions ([23],[6]). The topological changes (for example splitting, merging and formation of sharp corners) in the boundary are tackled by representing the evolving fronts using level sets.
