Abstract: In this paper we describe two approaches to the revision of probability functions. We assume that a probabilistic state of belief is captured by a counterfactual probability or Popper function, the revision of which determines a new Popper function. We describe methods whereby the original function determines the nature of the revised function. The first is based on a probabilistic extension of Spohn's OCFs, while the second exploits the structure implicit in the Popper function itself. This stands in contrast with previous approaches that associate a unique Popper function with each absolute (classical) probability function. We also describe iterated revision using these models. Finally, we consider the point of view that Popper functions may be abstract representations of certain types of absolute probability functions, but show that our revision methods cannot be naturally interpreted as conditionalization on these functions.

Reference-contexts: In Section 3 we 2 discuss the connection to Popper functions and present a probabilistic version of OCFs, as well as giving a quasi-infinitesimal interpretation of these models reminiscent of Adam's <ref> [1] </ref> "-semantics. This interpretation suggests that, more generally, one may be able to interpret Popper functions as an appropriate abstraction or summarization of a classical p-function. We then address the question of iterated revision of probability functions in Section 4. <p> Thus, we may suppose that an agent's belief set is determined by a probability function (p-function) P : L ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, satisfying the following conditions: 1. If ` A B then P (A) = P (B) 2. If ` A :B then P (A _ B) = P (A) + P (B) 3. <p> We define the conditional probability P (BjA) as P (A^B) by convention we set P (BjA) = 1 for all B otherwise. Semantically, a p-function can be characterized by a (normalized) weighting function P : W ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> such that P fP (w) : w 2 W g = 1. <p> To alleviate this difficulty, we intro duce nonstandard conditional p-functions, or Popper functions [29, 30, 12, 22]. A Popper function is a mapping P : L fi L ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> satisfying [22]: 1. P (A"A) = 1 2. P ("A) is a p-function 3. If ` A B then P (C"A) = P (C"B) 4. <p> In the following, P is unnor-malized since the additive parameters a i are unnormalized; but all relationships hold when normalization is performed. Recall that min (P i ) 1. k (1 ") for some small " &gt; 0. A variant of Adam's <ref> [1] </ref> semantics for conditionals can be used to verify that such an interpretation can be given and that it corresponds to an additive mixture (where the weights a i are a function of "). 13 Since (A) = k, W k " kAk 6= ;.

Reference-contexts: Methods of iterated revision that work directly with QRMs are therefore most directly applicable to the problem of Popper function revision. Several such proposals have been put forth. Safe contraction <ref> [3] </ref>, generalized epistemic entrenchment [25] and the probabilistically motivated system of Schlechta [26] each take a similar approach to the problem: each assumes the existence of a "global" ordering of entrenchment over all sentences in the language.

To this end, the AGM postulates below, are maintained to hold for any reasonable notion of revision <ref> [12] </ref>. (R1) K fl A is a belief set (i.e. deductively closed).

We briefly describe entrenchment relations below; but the crucial feature is the fact that they capture the revision policies of the agent, the information necessary to revise K to form K fl A . <p> Each p-function is compatible with a unique (deductively closed) belief set K. Since many p-functions are compatible with a fixed K, we take p-functions to be the basic notion from which belief sets are derived. This corresponds to the well-used tactic (e.g., <ref> [12, 22] </ref>) of defining a belief set to be the top of a p function. We define the conditional probability P (BjA) as P (A^B) by convention we set P (BjA) = 1 for all B otherwise. <p> In the special case where :A 62 K (or equivalently, P (A) &gt; 0), we can use conditionalization of P by A to effect revision by A and derive a revised p-function. We simply set P fl A = P (jA). The following observation is straight forward (see, e.g., <ref> [12] </ref>). Proposition 3.1 Let be a K-QRM such that :A 62 K, let P be a p-function compatible with , and let P fl A = P (jA). Then P fl A is compatible with K fl A . Thus "consistent" revision and conditionalization correspond in the desired manner. <p> Thus "consistent" revision and conditionalization correspond in the desired manner.

To alleviate this difficulty, we intro duce nonstandard conditional p-functions, or Popper functions <ref> [29, 30, 12, 22] </ref>. A Popper function is a mapping P : L fi L ! [0; 1] satisfying [22]: 1. P (A"A) = 1 2. P ("A) is a p-function 3. If ` A B then P (C"A) = P (C"B) 4. <p> The relationship between the revision of p-functions using nonstandard conditionalization and the AGM revision of beliefs sets is quite close (see, e.g., <ref> [12, Ch.5] </ref> or [22]). We take revision of a p-function P as defined above to be basic, assuming P is determined by an appropriate Popper function. <p> Indeed, a dimensional family satisfies an even stronger minimality requirement, for the elements of P i are orthogonal: if i 6= j then P i (A) = 1 and P j (A) = 0 for some A <ref> [12] </ref>. Thus, not only is the family itself as small as possible, its elements are as well. A simple reconstruction of CPMs demonstrates that they are equivalent to finite ordered families of p-functions and thus equivalent to Popper functions. <p> While they dictate the precise form of P fl A , they provide no guidance for the construction of a new probabilistic epistemic state (a CPM or POCF). This difficulty was first noticed by Harper [18]. In the nonprobabilistic setting, Gardenfors <ref> [12] </ref> circumvented this difficulty by introducing the notion of a belief revision system, a set K of belief sets and an AGM revision function fl that maps hK; Ai (where K 2 K and A 2 L) to K fl A 2 K. <p> An analogous argument can be made for P A;k (B":A ^ C). ffi Corollary 4.2 P (B"A) = P A;k (B"A) and P (B":A) = P A;k (B":A). Corollary 4.3 If k &gt; 0 then P A;k (B"&gt;) = P (B"A). Gardenfors <ref> [12] </ref> has proposed a set of postulates for the revision of p-functions that mirror the postulates (R1)-(R8). We present a modified version of these. 14 Let P be a p-function and A some consistent sentence.

A model of iterated revision that imposes additional structure on the change of epistemic state is therefore desirable. Lindstrom and Rabinowicz <ref> [22] </ref> have proposed a similar model for the revision of p-functions. They suggest that each p-function be associated with a unique Popper function. The Popper function associated with p-function P determines the revised p-function P fl A as described in the last section. <p> p-functions fP A;k 1 A;k (i) 6= ;g is defined as follows: P i = &gt; &gt; &lt; ffi i P (A)+i (jA)+ P (A)+i (jA) if P (A)+i (A) &gt; 0; P i+k (:A) (:A) = 0 14 In particular, we only consider revision by consistent A (see also <ref> [22] </ref>). Gardenfors permits revision by some inconsistent A to result in the inconsistent p-function P ? . 19 Theorem 4.4 Let P be any POCF that induces the ordered family fP i g.

Reference-contexts: Such rules allow conclusions to be reached in manner that is independent of context, in contrast to probabilistic inference. The locality of logical rules can be exploited if parts of the belief are (treated as if they are) fully belief <ref> [23] </ref>. It may also be that the cost associated with reaching incorrect (unhedged) conclusions and being forced to revise the belief set is outweighed by the probability of being correct. We might therefore think of a constraint B 2 K fl A as an instantiation of an acceptance rule [20].

Reference-contexts: Indeed, the stronger representation result of Spohn <ref> [27] </ref> can be adopted in our finitary setting. Following Spohn, we say an ordered family is dimensional iff for each P i there is a sentence A i such that P i (A i ) = 1 and P j (A i ) = 0 for all j &lt; i.

The problem of iterated revision requires that a revision function produce not only a new belief set or p-function, but a new epistemic state to guide subsequent revisions. <p> However, some proposals for iterated revision in the qualitative setting have been put forth. In this article we examine the extent to which similar considerations can be adapted to iterated probabilistic revision. We pay special attention to Spohn's <ref> [28] </ref> ordinal conditional functions (OCFs) and the author's [5, 7] proposal for minimal conditional (MC) revision. Spohn's model imposes additional structure on the usual revision functions requiring that the entrenchment and plausibility of sentences be quantified and that the evidence causing revision have an associated strength. <p> If A and B are both believed, we say A is more entrenched than B iff :B is less surprising than :A. This relation holds when an agent is more willing to give up belief in B than A. 2.2 Ordinal Conditional Functions Spohn <ref> [28] </ref> introduced a related but somewhat more detailed model of belief revision based on ordinal conditional functions or OCFs. Instead of a simple ordering of plausibility over possible worlds, a world is ranked on an ordinal scale according to its degree of plausibility. <p> If ` A then P (A) = 1 Accepted (rejected) propositions are those A such that P (A) = 1 (P (A) = 0). However, indeterminate propositions are now graded according to their 5 This distinction is analogous to that made by Spohn <ref> [28] </ref> between OCFs and SCFs. 6 probability. 6 The function P ? (A) = 1 for all A 2 L is dubbed the inconsistent p-function and will sometimes be treated as a p-function (corresponding to the belief set K ? = L). <p> As we noted earlier, POCFs have additional structure and this structure is exploited by A; k-conditionalization. Thus, the view of Popper functions as an appropriate representation of a probabilistic epistemic state in untenable if we use this revision model to effect changes in epistemic state. Spohn <ref> [28] </ref>, following Harper, indeed suggests that Popper functions are impoverished for precisely this reason. Let P be a POCF with underlying OCF and weighting function P . <p> Thus P A B = P A 0 (jB) = P A (jA ^ B). So, we have P A (C"B) = P (C"A ^ B) for all B; C. ffi 19 A similar point is made by Spohn <ref> [28] </ref> who briefly describes and dismisses a proposal much like MC-revision for QRMs. 20 By "minimal change" we mean that P A (C"B) = P (C"B) for as many C; B as possible, where P A is the Popper function induced by MC-revision of P .

Reference-contexts: Probabilistic revision seems to have received somewhat less attention than its qualitative counterpart, in some measure due to the fact that Popper functions (or to use Stalnaker's <ref> [29] </ref> more suggestive terminology, counterfactual probability functions) provide a rather natural and robust representation of an epistemic state and revision method in such a setting. <p> By now the connections between Popper functions and the qualitative representations of revision functions are well-understood <ref> [29, 30, 28, 12, 22] </ref> and confirm that the "belief as top of a p-function" perspective is tenable. The problem of iterated revision requires that a revision function produce not only a new belief set or p-function, but a new epistemic state to guide subsequent revisions. <p> Thus "consistent" revision and conditionalization correspond in the desired manner. If :A 2 K then P (A) = 0 and defining P fl A via conditionalization results in the inconsistent p-function P ? . To alleviate this difficulty, we intro duce nonstandard conditional p-functions, or Popper functions <ref> [29, 30, 12, 22] </ref>. A Popper function is a mapping P : L fi L ! [0; 1] satisfying [22]: 1. P (A"A) = 1 2. P ("A) is a p-function 3. If ` A B then P (C"A) = P (C"B) 4. <p> The weights of worlds in the same cluster of captures their relative likelihood should the agent accept them as epistemically possible. They can be viewed as counterfactual probabilities in the sense of Stalnaker <ref> [29] </ref>. 7 We will consistently use P (j) to denote standard conditional probability functions and P (") to denote nonstandard, Popper functions. 8 Definition 3.2 P = h; P i is a counterfactual probability model (CPM) iff (a) is a QRM; and Definition 3.3 Let P = h; P i be
