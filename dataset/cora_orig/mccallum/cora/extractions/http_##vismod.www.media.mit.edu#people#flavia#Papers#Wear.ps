Title: Wearable Performance

Abstract: Wearable computers offer the street performer powerful tools with which to create innovative experiences for the audience. As wearable technology moves computation from the desktop onto the users body, it provides an invitation to free performance from the indoor stage, bringing a new adaptive richness to the mobile world of street theater. We find it therefore compelling to explore several application contexts in which wearable technology enhances, extends and creates new examples of street performance. In this paper we offer a taxonomy of different genres of street performance and we describe how the wearable computer transforms, augments and enriches the traditional form in an original and witty manner.

Reference-contexts: Based on the observation that many street performers are actually skilled craftsmen of their own props and that some have good technological skills or are at least attracted by the potential offered by technology <ref> [1] </ref>, we have investigated how some street performers could benefit from the use of an affordable wearable computer. We have found that wearable computing can contribute to street performance in three ways: 1. <p> We then draw conclusions based on our past experience with creating technologically augmented performances [3,4]. Wearable Street Performance: Taxonomy and Technology Bim Mason has carried out an extensive study of street performers <ref> [1] </ref>. He has defined five categories that group performers according to their motivation and artistic intent. There are: Entertainers, Animators, Provocateurs, Communicators and Performing Artists.

Reference-contexts: In the augmented reality display water is turned into fire, simple inanimate objects become dangerously animated, and yawning generates expressive digital typography. The mime is wearing a small wearable computer <ref> [2] </ref> in his backpack. A flat panel display is connected to the wearable for the audience to use. Any member of the audience can take the display and hold it against the performer.
