Reference-contexts: This result almost settles a major open problem and has already led to many applications <ref> [1, 10, 14] </ref>. In some applications, however, one has to consider the interaction between the lower envelope of one collection of functions and the upper envelope of another collection.

Reference-contexts: This result not only implies the asserted bound on the complexity of the region enclosed between two envelopes, but also has several other useful applications, among which is a simple deterministic divide-and-conquer algorithm for computing lower envelopes, which we believe to be conceptually much simpler than the competing techniques of <ref> [3, 8, 14] </ref>. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we prove the main result concerning the overlay of the projections of two envelopes in 3-space. <p> This is equivalent to constructing the minimization diagram M F , as defined above, so that each face of M F is labeled with the unique function of F (if exists) attaining E F over . Several algorithms for this construction have recently been designed (see <ref> [3, 8, 14] </ref>), but they are either rather complicated or require the use of randomization. Here we present a simple deterministic algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer approach.

Reference-contexts: However, if one assumes, in addition, that the sets are separated, in the sense that no three of these sets is crossed by a common line, then it is shown by Cappell et al. <ref> [4] </ref> that, for such a collection C, the complexity of T (C) is O (n 2 ). This bound, in this restricted case, is slightly better than the bound derived above. The result of [4] applies in higher dimensions too: Under an appropriate assumption of separation of the sets in C, <p> these sets is crossed by a common line, then it is shown by Cappell et al. <ref> [4] </ref> that, for such a collection C, the complexity of T (C) is O (n 2 ). This bound, in this restricted case, is slightly better than the bound derived above. The result of [4] applies in higher dimensions too: Under an appropriate assumption of separation of the sets in C, the complexity of T (C) is O (n d-1 ).

Reference-contexts: For the purpose of analysis, we generalize the notion of a crossing, as follows. Let A (F ) denote the arrangement of F, namely the three-dimensional space decomposition induced by the graphs of the functions of F (see <ref> [9] </ref> for a more detailed definition). The level of a point w in A (F) is defined as the number of surfaces of F that lie vertically below w (note that 0-level points are precisely those that lie on or below the lower envelope E F ).

Reference-contexts: If t k, then e 0 contributes at most s (k) edge crossings to C 0;k (F ; G). Since there are only O (k 1-" n 2+" ) edges of A (G) at level at most k (see, e.g., <ref> [13, 15] </ref>), the number of crossings as above is O ( s (k)k 1-" n 2+" ) = O (k 2 n 2+" ), for any " &gt; 0.

Since there are only O (k 1-" n 2+" ) edges of A (G) at level at most k (see, e.g., <ref> [13, 15] </ref>), the number of crossings as above is O ( s (k)k 1-" n 2+" ) = O (k 2 n 2+" ), for any " &gt; 0.
