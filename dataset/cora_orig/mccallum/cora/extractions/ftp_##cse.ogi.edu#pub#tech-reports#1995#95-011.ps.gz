Reference-contexts: Applying Task Classification. 5 We considered several coding schemes that have been used by other group process researchers. None seemed to meet our needs. Several researchers have used Bales IPA <ref> (e.g., Hiltz et al., 1990) </ref> or Conference Process Analysis (e.g., [12]), sometimes augmented with taskspecif ic categories (e.g., Kanki & Foushee, 1989). These are designed to categorize group process, not task.

Reference-contexts: In an earlier study <ref> (Marshall & Novick, 1995) </ref>, we gathered traditional performance and subjective satisfaction measures in a laboratory experiment comparing the ef fectiveness of faceto-face, audio-only (telephone) and audio+video (multimedia) communications. Two-person teams were asked to perform two cooperative tasks: a construction task, and a problem solving and negotiation task. <p> In this section we describe the coding method that we developed and report on the results of the formal study. 1. Although in our earlier study <ref> (Marshall & Novick, 1995) </ref>, some participants in a decision-making labora tory task did ground their recommendations in prior experience.

Reference-contexts: Such a model would allow us to draw upon the wealth of knowledge about small group processes and small-group communicatory patterns <ref> (e.g., McGrath, 1984) </ref> to support the design, evaluation, and introduction of new technology to support unfacilitated natural work groups.

Reference-contexts: During the course of this study, our view of task changed dramatically . Initially, we perceived task as a grand, overarching, homogenous activity. When we actually observed meetings, we saw instead rapid shifts between low-level activities <ref> (cf., Nunamaker et al., 1991) </ref>. Our observations suggest that task entails a complex of goals and activities rather than a single goal or activity. There is usually a nominal tasksuch as setting sales policies or designing an aspect of a computer interfacethat forms a recurrent theme for meeting activities.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the list of possible tasks should be small enough to permit reliable coding; when coders have many alternatives available, there may be decreased consistency due to coder lapses as they forget about some of the alternatives available to them. <ref> (c.f., Pruitt and Lewis, 1975) </ref>. We are interested in coding group task at an intermediate level. <p> These are designed to categorize group process, not task. While it would be interesting to compare and relate process to task, these coding schemes do not capture the phenomena we wish to study. Other researchers have developed their own coding schemes <ref> (e.g., Pruitt & Lewis, 1975) </ref>, gen erally for the purposes of characterizing interaction in seen in specif ic laboratory tasks.
