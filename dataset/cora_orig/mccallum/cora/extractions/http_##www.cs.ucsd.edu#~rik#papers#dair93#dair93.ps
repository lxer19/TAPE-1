Abstract: This paper describes preliminary experiments documenting significant variations in word usage patterns within topical sublan-guages. As some phrases have very different collocational patterns than their constituent words, we look beyond occurrences of individual words, to consider word phrases. The mutual information statistic is used to measure the information content of phrases beyond that of their constituent words. We find that specialized topic areas give rise to phrases with very descriptive constituents which are then "exported" into general vocabulary. These phrases are also much more informative as word pairs outside the topic area than within it. Further, we find evidence of an intriguing "self-similar" regularity in this exporting relation across different hierarchical levels of topical areas.

Reference-contexts: of Topical Language parity between a phrase's use and the inde-pendent use of its constituent words. 3 The Use of Phrases in In formation Retrieval Amsler expounds on what he sees as the "Two Half-Truths of Information Science" that made text storage and retrieval a technique with hidden fatal flaws <ref> [1] </ref>: 1. A word is a contiguous sequence of al phabetic characters 2. Computers can retrieve information about a concept by retrieving occurrences of a word form which repre sented that concept The first half-truth ignores the fact that often mult-word forms will act much like a unit. <p> In these cases, although the phrase may be a useful descriptor or index term for a particular topic, the phrase's constituents are not.

Interestingly enough, there are dictionaries that already contain a substantial number of phrases. Ahlswedee et al found one seventh of the entries in a machine-readable version of Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary to be phrases [13]. Many words, however, are often missing from the dictionary.

Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that since phrases are even more dynamic than words, that this would especially be the case for phrases or "collocational expressions" <ref> [3] </ref>. Not only are collocational expressions context dependent but they are also transient in nature. New trendy expression (especially in the media) will come and go all the time.

Reference-contexts: D.A. Cruse has defined a "transparent" expression to be one whose meaning is derived directly from that of its constituent words; and "opaque" phrases as those whose semantics cannot be attributed to the simple composition of its constituent terms <ref> [4] </ref>. Halliday has made similar distinctions between "simple," "compound" and "phrasal" lexical items [8]. Halliday writes that often a phrase can act very much like a lexical unit in and of itself, and that often a phrase can have very different collocational patterns than the sum of its parts.

Reference-contexts: The second half-truth ignores the fact that words and concepts are simply not in a one to one relation. There are many words with multiple meanings and many concepts that require multiple words to be expressed. There have been many recent attempts to incorporate phrases into an indexing language <ref> [6] </ref> [11] [12] [14] [17].

Reference-contexts: simple collocation [15][7]<ref> [9] </ref>. As we are most interested in simple word compounds (such as "social security"), we use sequential word pairs, or bigrams to identify potentially interesting word co-occurrences. Church and Hanks have shown that compounds have a very fixed word order and that the average separation is one word [9]. Therefore, we found it reasonable to restrict ourselves to a window of one when parsing for bigrams.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we found it reasonable to restrict ourselves to a window of one when parsing for bigrams. The dictionary gives one definition of a phrase as "a word or group of spoken words that is perceived momentarily as a meaningful unit and that is preceded and followed by pauses <ref> [16] </ref>." It is this notion of phrase as a "meaningful unit" that we adapt in this paper. Wittgenstein's "meaning through use" philosophy provides another way of quantifying these notions [19]. Words have meanings derived from their use both independent of, and with respect to, use within a phrase.
