Abstract: The d-dimensional k-ary array A d k is the k-fold Cartesian product graph of the path P k on k vertices. We show that the (edge) isoperimetric number of A d k is given by i(A d k ) = i(P k ) = 2 c for all k and d, and identify the cardinalities and the structure of the isoperimetric sets.

Reference-contexts: The problem of finding extremal sets of the first (or, second) type is called the minimum-boundary-edge problem (or, the maximum-induced-edge problem). It can be shown that the minimum-boundary-edge and the maximum-induced-edge problems are equivalent for regular graphs <ref> [5] </ref>. Let @ m denote the number of boundary edges of an extremal set of the first type for any given m in a graph. <p> The analogue for the even discrete torus appears in Riordan [13]. The maximum-induced-edge problem for the d-dimensional k-ary array A d k was first solved by 3 Bollobas and Leader <ref> [5] </ref>. Since A d k is not regular, this is not helpful for the minimum-boundary-edge problem.

The first nontrivial bounds on the minimum-boundary-edge problem for the d-dimensional k-ary arrays were given by Bollobas and Leader <ref> [5] </ref>. The bounds obtained are not sharp enough to get i (A d k ) exactly however. Wang and Wang [14] solved the minimum-boundary-edge problem problem for P 1 fi fi P 1 , i.e. the d-dimensional infinite grid, where the minimum is taken over all nonempty finite subsets.

Reference-contexts: The maximum-induced-edge problem for the hypercube (hence the minimum-boundary-edge problem, because of its regularity) was solved by Harper <ref> [8] </ref> and extended by Lindsey [10] to the d-dimensional k-ary clique which we shall define formally in the next section. In both instances, there is a nested structure of solutions, and the first m vertices in lexicographical order constitute an extremal set.

Nakano [12] also used an embedding technique to prove the odd case in inequality (3). <p> Proposition 1 For the d-dimensional k-ary array A d k with k even, i (A d k ) 2=k. Proof We prove the lower bound for even k by extending the embedding technique of Leighton <ref> [9] </ref> who used it to obtain a lower bound for bw (A d k ) for even k. <p> The process stops when all the dimensions have eventually been corrected. When k is even, at most k d+1 =2 edges of the complete graph are routed through a given edge in the array (see <ref> [9] </ref>, page 225). In other words, removal of an edge in the array is equivalent to disconnecting at most k d+1 =2 edges in the complete graph. Now we prove that j@Xj=jXj 2=k for any X V (A d k ) where 1 jXj k d =2.

The d-dimensional k-ary array A d k is an undirected graph with k d nodes labeled by the integers from 0 to k d 1. <p> A natural approach for the exact calculation of i (A d k ) is to try to exploit the recursive Cartesian product structure A d k = P k fi A d1 k .

The lower bound calculation is split into separate cases, even k and odd k. 3.1 The Upper Bound To prove the upper bound, we utilize a general inequality given in <ref> [11] </ref> on the isoperimetric number of a Cartesian product graph, i.e. i (G fi H) minfi (G); i (H)g: (4) For completeness, we sketch the proof.

Continuing this way, we can obtain an isoperimetric set corresponding to any one of the d cardinalities listed above.
