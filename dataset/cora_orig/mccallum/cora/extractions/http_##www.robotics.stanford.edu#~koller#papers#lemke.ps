Abstract: The Nash equilibria of a two-person, non-zero-sum game are the solutions of a certain linear complementarity problem (LCP). In order to use this for solving a game in extensive form, it is first necessary to convert the game to a strategic description such as the normal form. The classical normal form, however, is often exponentially large in the size of the game tree. In this paper we suggest an alternative approach, based on the sequence form of the game. For a game with perfect recall, the sequence form is a linear sized strategic description, which results in an LCP of linear size. For this LCP, we show that an equilibrium is found by Lemke's algorithm, a generalization of the Lemke-Howson method.

Reference-contexts: For such games, however, the algorithm by Lemke and Howson (1964) also finds an 9 equilibrium. It is known that certain equilibria of bimatrix games may be `elusive' to the Lemke-Howson method <ref> (Aggarwal 1973) </ref>. Since the two algorithms operate similarly, we conclude that certain equilibria may be elusive to our method as well. The size of the sequence form is linear in the size of the extensive game, whereas the size of the normal form is generally exponential.

Reference-contexts: These constraints define a linear complementarity problem (LCP). An LCP in standard form is specified by a pair b; M with a vector b in IR n and an n fi n matrix M <ref> (see Cottle, Pang and Stone 1992, p. 1) </ref>. <p> Since the elements of the secondary ray are solutions to (3.1), this equation for = 0 and = 1 implies ~w = d~z 0 + M ~z : (4:1) Furthermore, it is easy to see that ~z 6= 0 since the secondary ray is not the primary ray <ref> (Cottle, Pang and Stone 1992, p. 275) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Wilson (1972) interpreted the entering columns in the Lemke-Howson algorithm as best responses against the current pair of mixed strategies. In the case of the sequence form, the components of p and q in (2.4) and (2.7) can be interpreted as payoff contributions of optimal choices at information sets <ref> (von Stengel 1995, Section 6) </ref>. It is therefore quite possible that, as in Wilson's algorithm, the entering columns can be interpreted as choices at information sets that are best responses against the current pair of realization plans.
