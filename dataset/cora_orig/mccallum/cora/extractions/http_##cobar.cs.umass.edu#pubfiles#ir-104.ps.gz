Abstract: Dictionary methods for cross-language information retrieval give performance below that for mono-lingual retrieval. Failure to translate multi-term phrases has been shown to be one of the factors responsible for the errors associated with dictionary methods. First, we study the importance of phrasal translation for this approach. Second, we explore the role of phrases in query expansion via local context analysis and local feedback and show how they can be used to significantly reduce the error associated with automatic dictionary translation.

Reference-contexts: This paper explores the identification of phrases in queries and the effectiveness of simple phrasal translation. In addition, we investigate the role of phrases in query expansion by comparing two approaches, local feedback <ref> [AF77] </ref> and Local Context Analysis [XC96], to expanding queries at various stages of the translation process. 2 Previous Work Effective systems for mono-lingual information retrieval have been available for several years. <p> Relevance feedback [SB90] is a method by which a query is modified by the addition of terms found in documents known to be relevant to the query. Local feedback <ref> [AF77] </ref> differs from classic relevance feedback in that it assumes the top retrieved documents are relevant. Local feedback modification before or after automatic query translation via MRD significantly improves performance. Pre-translation feedback expansion creates a stronger base for translation and improves precision.

Reference-contexts: There have been three main approaches to CLIR: translation via machine translation techniques [Rad94]; parallel or comparable corpora-based methods [DD95a, LL90, SB96], and dictionary-based methods <ref> [Sal72, Pev72, HG96, BC96] </ref>. Each of these approaches has shown promise, but also has disadvantages associated with it. Results suggest that improvements gained via machine translation techniques may not outweigh the cost of linguistic analysis. <p> Performance is also dependent on how well the cor pora are aligned. Our work takes the third approach and applies dictionary-based methods. Automatic machine readable dictionary (MRD) query translation leads to a drop in effectiveness of 40-60% below that of mono-lingual retrieval <ref> [HG96, BC96] </ref>. This is due primarily to three factors. First, specialized vocabulary not contained in the dictionary will not be translated. Second, dictionary translations are inherently ambiguous and add extraneous terms to the query. Third, failure to translate multi-term concepts as phrases reduces effectiveness. <p> Although these approaches work well, we use simple dictionary translation because we are interested in exploring what can be done when scarce resources such as parallel corpora are unavailable. 3 Dictionary Translation and Query Expansion Previous studies <ref> [HG96, BC96] </ref> have shown that automatic word-by-word (WBW) translation of queries via MRD results in a 40-60% loss in effectiveness below that of monolingual retrieval. One of the factors causing this drop in effectiveness is ambiguity caused by the transfer of extraneous terms. <p> One of the factors causing this drop in effectiveness is ambiguity caused by the transfer of extraneous terms. What may be more important however, is the failure to translate multi-term concepts as phrases. We have shown <ref> [BC96] </ref> that, despite the loss of phrases, query expansion via local feedback could reduce the errors such an approach normally makes. Relevance feedback [SB90] is a method by which a query is modified by the addition of terms found in documents known to be relevant to the query. <p> Words that were not found in the dictionary were added to the new query without translation. The Collins English-Spanish bilingual MRD was used for the translations. For a more detailed description of this process, see <ref> [BC96] </ref>. Phrasal translations were performed using information on phrases and word usage contained in the Collins MRD. This allowed the replacement of a source phrase with its multi-term representation in the target language. When a phrase could not be defined using this information, it was translated word-by-word as described above. <p> INQUERY is based on the Bayesian inference net model and is described elsewhere [TC91b, TC91a, CCB95]. 5 Phrasal Translation Failure to translate multi-term concepts as phrases greatly reduces the effectiveness of dictionary translation. In experiments where query phrases were manually translated <ref> [BC96] </ref>, performance improved by up to 25% over automatic word-by-word (WBW) query translation. Our hypothesis is that automatically identifying phrases and defining them as such would improve effectiveness. To test this hypothesis, we compare performance of automatically translated queries both with and without phrasal identification and translation.

Reference-contexts: The evolutionary programming approach was the most effective, but results were disappointing, with each of the methods performing well below the word-byword translation baseline. More recently, Davis <ref> [Dav96] </ref> uses part-of-speech tagging to select the best Spanish translations for English query terms. A parallel corpus is then used to further disambiguate the translated queries by choosing the Spanish terms that retrieve documents most like those retrieved for the English query.

Reference-contexts: The method also relies on the use of parallel corpora which are not always readily available. Another method that relies on parallel and aligned corpora has been suggested by Dunning and Davis <ref> [DD93] </ref>. Their method is based on the vector space model and involves the linear transformation of the representation of a query in one language to its corresponding representation in another language. The transformation is done by reduction of the document space to generate a translation matrix.

Reference-contexts: A closer look at individual queries reveals that phrasal translation is not ineffective, but that results are sensitive to poor translations. Average precision drops 40% below a baseline of automatic WBW translation for TREC <ref> [Har95] </ref> query SP30 when phrasal translations are included. However, the problem for this query is that sports program is translated as emisi on deportiva meaning televised sports program. When the poor phrasal translation is replaced with a WBW translation, results improve considerably (+150% over the baseline).

Reference-contexts: The top ranked concept was added to a query with a weight of 1.0. Each additional concept was down-weighted by 1/100 with respect to the weight given its predecessor. This weighting scheme was shown to be effec-tive in LCA experiments for the TREC5 evaluations <ref> [Har96] </ref>. Table 10 shows the best results for post-translation expansion via local feedback and LCA. In this table, local feedback expansion was done by addition of the top 20 terms from the top 50 documents.

However, performance measured by average precision is still considerably below that of mono-lingual retrieval.
