Abstract: A complementarity problem with a continuous mapping f from the n-dimensional Euclidean space R n into itself can be written as the system of equations Under the assumption that the mapping f is a P 0 -function, we study various aspects of homotopy continuation methods that trace a trajectory consisting of solutions of the family of systems of equations until the parameter t 0 attains 0. Here (a; b) denotes a 2n-dimensional constant positive vector. We establish the existence of a trajectory which leads to a solution of the problem, and then present a numerical method for tracing the trajectory. We also discuss the global and local convergence of the method.

Reference-contexts: The complementarity problem CP [f ] with respect to a continuous mapping f : R n ! R n (see, for example, Cottle <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> , Karamardian [ 6 ] , Kojima [ 7 ] , Lemke and Howson [ 15 ] , etc.) is defined to be the problem of finding a z 2 R 2n such that z = (x; y) 0; y = f (x) and x i y i <p> Let ^ a = (^x 1 ^y 1 ; ^x 2 ^y 2 ; ; ^x n ^y n ) 2 R n ++ . Now we consider the family of systems of equations with the parameter t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>: F (x; y) = ((1 t) ^ a + ta; b) and (x; y) 2 R 2n Let t 1 be the supremum of ^ t's such that the system (6) has a solution for every t 2 [0; ^ t ]. <p> Since the right-hand side ((1 t) ^ a + ta; b) of the system (6) lies in the compact convex subset D = f ((1 t) ^ a + ta; b) : t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>g of R n + fi B ++ [f ] for all t 2 [0; 1], (iii) of Condition 1.5 ensures that the sequence f (x k ; y k )g is bounded. Hence we may assume that it converges to some ( x; y). <p> Since the right-hand side ((1 t) ^ a + ta; b) of the system (6) lies in the compact convex subset D = f ((1 t) ^ a + ta; b) : t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>g of R n + fi B ++ [f ] for all t 2 [0; 1], (iii) of Condition 1.5 ensures that the sequence f (x k ; y k )g is bounded. Hence we may assume that it converges to some ( x; y). By the continuity of the mapping F , the point ( x; y; t) satisfies the system (6). <p> Let fi 2 (0; 1) and &gt; 0 be constants satisfying (7), and let z be the solution of the Newton equation (8) at z with the parameter fi 2 (0; fi] . (i) Define fl = maxf 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> : z z 2 R 2n + g; (11) e () = F ( z z) F ( z) + DF ( z)z for every 2 [0; fl ]: (12) 14 Then lim ke ()k= = 0; (13) F ( z z) = (1 )F ( z) + (fi <p> If t s (fi) then F ( z z) 2 U; Proof: By the definition (27) of s (fi) and Lemma 7.5, the relations (28) and (29) hold for every 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. We are now ready to prove Theorem 7.2. We have already shown in Theorem 6.2 that the sequence ft k g converges to zero as k ! 1. Let K be a positive integer such that t k s (fi) for every k K.

Reference-contexts: from R n into itself with an nfin matrix M , it is monotone if and only if M is a positive semi-definite matrix, and a uniform P -function if and only if M is a P -matrix, i.e., all the principal minors of M are positive (Fiedler and Ptak <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> ). It is well-known that the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions for linear and convex quadratic programs can be formulated as a positive semi-definite linear complementarity problem. Conditions 1.1 and 1.2 above can be unified as follows: Lemma 1.4. If Condition 1.1 or 1.2 holds then Condition 1.5 does.

See also the papers [ 13; 20; 21 ] . <p> Proof of Lemma 1.4 First we deal with the case where the mapping f satisfies Condition 1.1. The statement (i) of Condition 1.5 directly follows from the definition of a uniform P -function. It has been shown in <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> that F maps R 2n + onto R n + fi R n homeomorphically. In particular there exists an ( x; y) 2 R 2n + such that F ( x; y) = (e; 0). Recall that e = (1; ; 1) 2 R n . <p> Thus (ii) follows from the domain invariance theorem (see Schwartz [ 24 ] ). We remark here that if a continuous mapping f satisfies Condition 1.1 then F maps R 2n + onto R n + fi R n homeomorphically (Kojima, Mizuno and Noma <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> ). Now we are ready to establish the existence of the trajectory F 1 (C) consisting of solutions of the system (3) for all positive t. Theorem 4.4.

Although we can apply the algorithm to linear complementarity problems, the main emphasis will be placed on nonlinear cases. In Section 6 we show the global convergence property of the algorithm. <p> The algorithms ALG1 [U; fi; ; ] and ALG2 [U; fi; ; ] as well as their global and local convergence results in this paper can apply to linear complementarity problems satisfying Condition 1.5. We could modify the ALG1 [U; fi; ; ] to derive the path-following algorithm ( <ref> [ 13; 21 ] </ref> ) which solves linear complementarity problems with positive semi-definite matrices in O ( p nL) iterations. Furthermore we could prove the globally linear convergence of the modified algorithm when it is applied to linear complementarity problems with P -matrices. <p> the paper [ 8 ] but cut in the revised version, will be further extended to a wider subclass of linear complementarity problems with P 0 -matrices in the paper [ 9 ] where we explore a unified approach ( [ 14 ] ) to both the path-following algorithm ( <ref> [ 13; 21 ] </ref> ) and the potential reduction algorithm ( [ 14 ] ) for linear complementarity problems.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, by applying the implicit function theorem (see, for example, Ortega and Rheinboldt <ref> [ 22 ] </ref> ) to the system (3) at each complementary solution z of the CP [f ] and t = 0, we see that the unique trajectory F 1 (C), whose existence is ensured by Theorem 4.4, converges to z as t ! 0. <p> Since the sets W and U (t 1 ) are convex, the inequalities (23) and (24) follow from (21), (22) and Theorem 3.2.3 of <ref> [ 22 ] </ref> . (iv) It follows from (ii) of Condition 7.1 that the Jacobian matrix DF (z) is Lipschitz continuous on the bounded convex set W , i.e., there is a positive number such that kDF (z 2 ) DF (z 1 )k 2kz 2 z 1 k for every <p> DF (z) is Lipschitz continuous on the bounded convex set W , i.e., there is a positive number such that kDF (z 2 ) DF (z 1 )k 2kz 2 z 1 k for every z 1 ; z 2 2 W: The assertion (iv) follows from Theorem 3.2.12 of <ref> [ 22 ] </ref> . Lemma 7.4. Let z 2 F 1 (U (t 1 )), t = c F ( z) &gt; 0, and let z be the solution of the Newton equation (8) at z with the parameter fi 2 (0; fi].

Reference-contexts: (x; y) 2 S + [f ] : (x; y) &gt; 0g: This paper studies homotopy continuation methods for nonlinear complementarity problems, which were originally developed for linear programs (Gonzaga [ 3 ] , Kojima, Mizuno and Yoshise [ 12 ] , Monteiro and Adler [ 20 ] , Renegar <ref> [ 23 ] </ref> , Vaidya [ 26 ] , etc.), and then extended to linear complementarity problems (Kojima, Mizuno and Yoshise [ 13 ] , Megiddo [ 17 ] ) and nonlinear complementarity problems (Kojima, Mizuno and Noma [ 10; 11 ] ). <p> A common basic idea of the algorithms in this class is tracing the path of centers (or analytic centers) of polytopes which leads to solutions. This idea was proposed by Sonnevend [ 25 ] , and the first polynomial time algorithm in this class was given by Renegar <ref> [ 23 ] </ref> . We also refer to Megiddo [ 17 ] who generalized the idea to linear complementarity problems and, in particular, to linear programs in the primal-dual setting. We describe an outline of the homotopy continuation method for the CP [f ].

Reference-contexts: Hence ( x; y) 2 R 2n ++ . It follows from Lemma 4.1 that the mapping F is a local homeomorphism at ( x; y). (See the domain invariance theorem in Schwartz <ref> [ 24 ] </ref> .) Hence the system (6) has a solution for every t sufficiently close to t. This contradicts the definition of t. 8 Lemma 4.3. (i) R n (ii) F maps R 2n ++ onto R n ++ fi B ++ [f ] homeomorphically. <p> Hence F maps R 2n ++ onto R n ++ fiB ++ [f ]. By Lemma 4.1, the continuous mapping F is one-to-one on the open subset R 2n ++ of R 2n . Thus (ii) follows from the domain invariance theorem (see Schwartz <ref> [ 24 ] </ref> ). We remark here that if a continuous mapping f satisfies Condition 1.1 then F maps R 2n + onto R n + fi R n homeomorphically (Kojima, Mizuno and Noma [ 10 ] ).
