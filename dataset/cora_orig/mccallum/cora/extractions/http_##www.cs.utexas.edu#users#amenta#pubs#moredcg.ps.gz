Title: A short proof of an interesting Helly-type theorem  
Author: Nina Amenta 
Address: 1300 South Second Street Minneapolis, MN 55454  
Affiliation: The Geometry Center  
Abstract: We give a short proof of the theorem that any family of subsets of R d , with the property that the intersection of any non-empty finite subfamily can be represented as the disjoint union of at most k closed convex sets, has Helly number at most k(d + 1).

Reference-contexts: The theorem follows from the observation that there is a Helly-type theorem about the constraint set of every LP-type problem. Informally, the LP-type problems are the class of problems which can be solved by combinatorial linear programming algorithms such as [S90], <ref> [C90] </ref>, [MSW92]. So the minimization problem we construct is computationally similar to linear programming, although geometrically the intersection of the constraints fails not only to be convex, but even to be connected.

Reference-contexts: Theorems of the form "F has Helly number h" are called Helly-type theorems they follow the model of Helly's theorem, which states that the family of convex sets in R d has Helly number d + 1. There are many Helly-type theorems; for excellent surveys see <ref> [DGK63] </ref> and the recent [E93]. This paper is concerned with a generalization of Helly's theorem: fl email: nina@geom.umn.edu.

We give a short and intuitive proof, using a different axiomatic system, borrowed from computational geometry.

Reference-contexts: that when the common intersection of any at most k members of F can be expressed as the disjoint union of at most k closed convex sets, so can the intersection of any finite subfamily (<ref> [GM61] </ref>, Theorem 2). Theorem 1.1 was first conjectured by by Grunbaum and Motzkin in 1961 [GM61]. They proved the case k = 2, using a more general axiomatic structure in place of convexity.

Our approach is to introduce an ordering on the points of R d , and study the problem of minimizing over any subfamily of F .

A basis is a subfamily G H such that w (G G) w (G), for all G 2 G. The combinatorial dimension of a concrete LP-type problem is the maximum cardinality of any feasible basis. The combinatorial dimension, for example, of Lexicographic Convex Programming in R d is d. <p> not difficult to see that every subfamily G must contain a basis B G with w (B) = w (G), and that for three subfamilies B F G with w (B) = w (G), it must also be the case that w (F ) = w (B). (See [SW92] or <ref> [MSW92] </ref> for other simple properties of LP-type problems.) Lemma 2.1 Let (W; H; ) be a concrete LP-type problem of combinatorial dimension c. H has Helly number at most c + 1.

Reference-contexts: This suggests the possibility of applying linear programming algorithms to other problems in which the the topological complexity of the intersection of the constraints, although non-trivial, remains bounded by a constant. 2 Framework LP-type problems are defined by an abstract combinatorial framework due to Sharir and Welzl <ref> [SW92] </ref>. We will use a slightly less abstract definition for a subclass of LP-type problems, which we call concrete LP-type problems. <p> The interested reader can easily verify that for every concrete LP-type problem (W; H; ), the pair (H; w) is an LP-type problem as defined in <ref> [SW92] </ref> or [MSW92].
