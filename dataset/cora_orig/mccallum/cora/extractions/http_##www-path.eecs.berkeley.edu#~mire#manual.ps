Title: CAR-DRIVER MODELS FOR MANUAL AND AUTOMATED TRAVEL

Abstract: This paper presents a model for manual and automated traffic flow. The model is based on the abstraction of vehicle activities by the space and time taken up by the vehicle engaged in the activity. The manual driver model includes the activities of vehicle following and lane change and allows for different levels of aggressiveness of drivers. The parameters of the activities are calibrated with real highway data. The expectation is that this model will provide more realistic estimates of highway capacity while retaining the efficiency of macro-scale simulators.

Reference-contexts: It departs from traditional approaches by allowing differentiation among types of drivers and types of activities that drivers perform. The model is an outgrowth of work on automated traffic flow on an AHS <ref> (Broucke and Varaiya, 1996) </ref>. The paper is structured as follows. We begin by presenting the activity model, including the conservation of vehicles law and velocity dynamics and show how vehicle activities are abstracted in the model by the space-time they use up.

Reference-contexts: Field data was collected along the I-880 freeway in Oakland <ref> (Petty et al., 1996) </ref> from loop detectors during peak hours. The loop detectors are placed 1/3 of a mile apart on the freeway and on all entry and exit ramps. The detectors are placed in pairs. <p> The analysis of this data, conducted in accordance with the guidelines found in <ref> (Petty et al., 1996) </ref> revealed a discrepancy between the minimal headway to avoid collision and the desired (comfortable) headway distance. <p> In general the results of the simulation match the real life situation. The aggregated value of the space remaining free allows headways comparable or longer than given by the FSP data <ref> (Petty et al., 1996) </ref>. The capacities of the exits exceed current demand. This implies that introduction of automated or semi-automated lanes may eliminate the slowdown on the bridge thus decreasing the overall travel time.
