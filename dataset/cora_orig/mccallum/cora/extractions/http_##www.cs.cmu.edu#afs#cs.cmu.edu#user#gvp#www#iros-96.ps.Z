Abstract: This paper describes a system for obtaining the motion plan for a planar assembly task, given a sequence of observations of a human performing it. The motion plan in configuration space is a series of connected path segments lying outside and on the configuration space obstacle. We use the observed configurations of the assembled objects to selectively compute the features of the c-space obstacle on which the path lies. We project the observed configurations onto these features and reconstruct the path segments. The connected path segments form the model of the observed task and can be used to program a robot to repeat the task. We demonstrate the system using the planar peg in hole task.

Reference-contexts: Work such as by Bajaj et al [2] deal with algebraically computing the c-space obstacle, but is limited to translational motion only. Other work such as by Avnaim et al [1], and Brost <ref> [3] </ref> deal with computing the c-space obstacles in the planar case with both rotation and translation. <p> The vertices of the c-space obstacle are defined by their coordinates. We briey introduce the representation of a two dimensional surface in c-space corresponding to a single vertex-on-edge (ve) contact here. The representations of the all other possible contact configurations can be found in Brosts work <ref> [3] </ref>. Consider two polygons in contact in a plane as shown in Figure 4. The vertex of the moving object is in contact with the edge of the fixed object. The configuration of the moving triangle is (x,y,q). <p> The error in the observation will be the distance between o i and t i given by (12). (12) The counterparts of the equations (4)-(6) and (9)-(10) exist for the ev facets and the four classes of edges. These are derived in <ref> [3] </ref>. The form of these equations are listed in the Appendix for reference. 4.3 C-surface Selection For every observed configuration o i , we obtain a set of feature pairs FP i which satisfy the contact conditions (1)- (3). <p> The analytical equations describing these features are parametrized by p or q, or both, or neither. (Only the x component of the features are given here for brevity). The complete derivation and details are in <ref> [3] </ref>. There are two types of facets, one due to a single vertex on edge (ve) contact, and the other due to a single edge on vertex (ev) contact.

Reference-contexts: We use Brosts results in our work. 3 Observation of the Assembly Task The compliant motion used by the human performing the assembly, consists of relatively small but significant motion when objects are in contact. The APO system captures this information using a real time stereo system <ref> [6] </ref>. The stereo system gives us a sequence of dense and accurate 3D images of the scene. The assembled object is then identified and tracked throughout the range image sequence using the 3D template matching algorithm [13].
