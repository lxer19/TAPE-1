Abstract: It is well known that the n-ary morphisms defined on projective algebraic curves satisfy some strong local-to-global equational rules of derivation not satisfied in general by universal algebras. For example, every rationally defined group law on a cubic curve must be commutative. Here we extract from the geometry of curves a first-order property (gL) satisfied by all morphisms defined on these curves such that the equational consequences known for projective curves can be derived automatically from a set of six rules (stated within the first-order logic with equality). First, the rule (gL) is implemented in the theorem-proving program Otter. Then we use Otter to automatically prove some incidence theorems on projective curves without any further reference to the underlying geometry or topology of the curves.

Reference-contexts: In fact, even the set of all implications valid in these two classes of algebra are the same. This was proved by Harry Lakser and R. Padmanabhan in <ref> [2] </ref>. 4 Concluding Remarks The rule " =(gL)) " viewed as an inference rule to derive stronger equations from relatively weaker ones is, in a sense, custom-made for the equational theory of Abelian varieties.

Reference-contexts: Corollary 4. The equational theory of the algebra h; i contains all the identities satisfied by the double inversion operation x 1 y 1 true in every Abelian group. W. McCune has shown (in <ref> [5] </ref>) that the single 3-variable identity on the right side characterizes the binary operation of double inversion x y = x 1 y 1 in Abelian groups 6 with the element e as the group identity.

Reference-contexts: So xy +e = (x)(y). Replacing x by a and y by b, we get a+b+e = ab. Thus any two group laws must differ only by a constant. In the literature this is often stated as follows (see, e.g., J.S. Milne, "Abelian Varieties" <ref> [7, Remark 2.3 on p. 105] </ref>): "A group structure on is uniquely determined by the choice of the zero element". In fact, in the above calculation, if e = 0, then a + b = ab itself. Theorem 3. Let e be an inflexion point on .

Reference-contexts: Theorem 7 is new, and Otter's proof as given above is the first equational proof. The last result about the majority polynomial is really folklore among universal algebraists, albeit via the term condition (see references in <ref> [9] </ref>). Here we include them just to demonstrate the ease with which Otter handles such equational proofs.
