Abstract: Open-architecture machine tool controllers have been an important research subject in both academia and industry. They are hard real-time applications that require a built-in database management system to support concurrent data access and provide well-defined interfaces. These advanced applications often utilize object-oriented models to handle complex data types. Since there exists no agreed-upon real-time object model, we design a conceptual real-time object-oriented data model, called ROMPP (Real-time Object Model with Performance Polymorphism). It captures the key characteristics of real-time control applications, namely, timing constraints and performance polymorphism. It uses specialization dimensions to model timing specifications and letter class hierarchies to capture performance polymorphism. Based on the model, we develop a prototype controller on our open-architecture machine tool controller testbed. The controller has been successfully used for a 6-axis robotic table.

There is a general consensus that the controller should have a modular architecture and well-defined interfaces that allow third parties to develop and use these modules independently. Modules can be either hardware or software.

Reference-contexts: Should the performance requirements of an application change, the mechanism would transparently rebind the requested service with the most appropriate implementation. Performance polymorphism in ROMPP is captured by the letter class hierarchy, which is based on an object-oriented programming techniquethe envelope/letter structure <ref> [8] </ref>. Definition 9. An envelope/letter structure is a composite object structure formed by a pair of classes that act as one: an outer class (envelope class, or EC) that is the visible part to the user, and an inner class (letter class, or LC) that buries implementation details.

Reference-contexts: Unlike our work, none of the existing models were specifically targeted to real-time open-architecture controllers. Due to limited 213 space, interested reader is referred to <ref> [26] </ref> for a comparison between ROMMP and existing real-time models, such as CHAOS [3, 20], ARTS [17, 23], RTC++ [12], Flex [13], HiPAC [9], RTSORAC [25], and MDARTS [15]. 5 CONCLUSIONS In the paper, we identified timing constraints and performance polymorphism as two key characteristics of real-time manufacturing applications. <p> As next step, we are investigating the impact of schema evolution technology on real-time OODBs in terms of reducing turn-around time for developing real-time control applications, and for reusing the most appropriate kernel classes with minimal effort. Preliminary results are reported in <ref> [26] </ref>. 6 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research was supported in part by the Horace H.
