Abstract: Characterisation results and Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms including exact Abstract The area-interaction process and the continuum random-cluster model are char-acterised in terms of certain functional forms of their respective conditional intensities. In certain cases, these two point process models can be derived from a bivariate point process model which in many respects is simpler to analyse and simulate. Using this correspondence we devise a two-component Gibbs sampler, which can be used for fast and exact simulation by extending the recent ideas of Propp and Wilson. We further introduce a Swendsen-Wang type algorithm. The relevance of the results within spatial statistics as well as statistical physics is discussed. simulation for some spatial point processes

Reference-contexts: Then, as shown in Baddeley et al. <ref> [4] </ref>, the general definition of a nearest-neighbour point process is equivalent to having a density of the form f (x) = ff y2C (x) where ff &gt; 0 is a normalising constant, C (x) is the set of (maximal) connected components defined by x and () 0 satisfies certain regularity conditions <p> The Ripley-Kelly Markov point processes [32] as well as certain Poisson cluster processes [9] are special cases of (5), cf.

Lattice processes with a density of a form similar to (5) have recently been studied by Mtller and Waagepetersen [30], where among other things characterisation results similar to those below are discussed.

Similarly as in the Ising/Potts models, phase transition means that infinite-volume limits fail to be unique. In particular, realisations tend, even for large systems, to be dominated by a single type of point (despite the symmetry of the model).

Reference-contexts: The area-interaction model for clustered patterns has been applied to liquid-vapour equilibrium in chemistry [39], and may also be useful as a "selfish herd" model in biology [18]. In this paper we study the area-interaction process [2], and two related processes, namely the continuum random-cluster model <ref> [7, 29] </ref> and the penetrable spheres mixture model [39, 19, 33, 34]. The last model is higly relevant in statistical physics, in providing the most well-known example of a phase transition in a continuous setting. The plan of this paper is as follows. <p> An important motivation for doing simulation is to obtain a better understanding of the phase transition phenomenon. It is well known that the mixture model exhibits a phase transition for sufficiently large values of the model parameter, but not for small values (see e.g. Chayes et al. <ref> [7] </ref>). The open problem is to decide whether the onset of the phase transition is marked by a unique critical point, and if so, to find its (approximate) value. Here we will initiate a study in this direction based on exact simulation. <p> This model seems to have been rediscovered many times, e.g. in <ref> [7] </ref> and [28]; the earliest appearance in the literature we are aware of is in [25]. We use the name "continuum random-cluster model" because of the strong analogy with the random-cluster representation of the Ising/Potts models introduced by Fortuin and Kasteleyn [11] (see [6] and [16] for recent reviews). <p> This is a consequence of the phase transition behaviour in the mixture model (10), which was demonstrated by Ruelle [36] and later in <ref> [7] </ref> and [13] using percolation arguments analogous to the random-cluster derivation (see e.g. [6]) of the phase transition occurring in Ising and Potts models.

Reference-contexts: Finally, in Section 5, we introduce an alternative Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the above point process models. This algorithm is similar in spirit to the Swendsen-Wang [38] algorithm for simulation of the Ising model and was simultaneously and independently discovered by Chayes and Machta <ref> [8] </ref>. 2 Characterisation results In this section, we establish some characterisation results for the area-interaction process and the continuum random-cluster process; the results are of interest on their own, but they motivate also the interest in the closely connected penetrable spheres mixture model in Sections 3-5. <p> This algorithm has independently been discovered by Chayes and Machta <ref> [8] </ref>. The algorithm works for the important symmetric case fi 1 = fi 2 = fi of the mixture model (and hence also for the area-interaction model with fl = e fi and for the continuum random-cluster process with fl = 1 2 ).

In this paper we study the area-interaction process [2], and two related processes, namely the continuum random-cluster model <ref> [7, 29] </ref> and the penetrable spheres mixture model [39, 19, 33, 34]. The last model is higly relevant in statistical physics, in providing the most well-known example of a phase transition in a continuous setting. The plan of this paper is as follows. <p> Note that the model exhibits interactions between pairs of points only. Pairwise interaction models appear to be a useful and flexible class of models for regular patterns, but probably not so for clustered patterns <ref> [10, 12, 29] </ref>. A more promising way of modelling attraction between points in a spatial pattern is to allow interaction terms of higher order [2, 14, 29], or to generalise the Markov property to depend on the configuration as in the definition of nearest-neighbour Markov point processes (cf. [3]). <p> Pairwise interaction models appear to be a useful and flexible class of models for regular patterns, but probably not so for clustered patterns [10, 12, 29].

Reference-contexts: The area-interaction model [2] in contrast is a Markov point process that can be used both for clustered and repulsive models by varying its interaction parameter. More recent generalisations are suggested in [23, 26], while lattice models of a somewhat similar nature are studied in <ref> [30] </ref> and in [17]. Repulsive area-interaction is particularly useful in object recognition to avoid multiple response caused by the occlusion of many overlapping objects [1]. <p> The Ripley-Kelly Markov point processes [32] as well as certain Poisson cluster processes [9] are special cases of (5), cf. Baddeley et al. [4]. Lattice processes with a density of a form similar to (5) have recently been studied by Mtller and Waagepetersen <ref> [30] </ref>, where among other things characterisation results similar to those below are discussed. For specificity we let henceforth u ~ v in (4) be the usual relation: u ~ v if and only if jju vjj R, where R &gt; 0 is given.

The first difference turns out to be inconsequential, but the second requires special treatment. <p> It would be very nice if the Swendsen-Wang type algorithm could be combined with the ideas of the previous section in order to obtain exact samples, but unfortunately it seems very difficult to find any useful monotonicity property of the algorithm. Propp and Wilson <ref> [31] </ref> make a similar remark about the original Swendsen-Wang algorithm. They are still able to obtain exact samples in reasonable time also in the phase transition regime by simulating the Fortuin-Kasteleyn random-cluster model rather than the Ising/Potts models directly.

Reference-contexts: This is a consequence of the phase transition behaviour in the mixture model (10), which was demonstrated by Ruelle <ref> [36] </ref> and later in [7] and [13] using percolation arguments analogous to the random-cluster derivation (see e.g. [6]) of the phase transition occurring in Ising and Potts models. Similarly as in the Ising/Potts models, phase transition means that infinite-volume limits fail to be unique.

Reference-contexts: Here we will initiate a study in this direction based on exact simulation. Finally, in Section 5, we introduce an alternative Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the above point process models.
