Abstract: A method for shape reconstruction from contours is presented using isotopic deformation. The reconstructed shape is free of self-intersection and it can incorporate given feature correspondences. The method automatically adds vertices, where necessary, to satisfy these requirements. A new method for handling bifurcation is also proposed, which can handle cases that are problematic for some other algorithms. The method proposed is suitable for terrain modeling, since reconstructed shapes generated by the method do not have overhangs. The running time of the algorithm is dependent on the complexity of the input scene and is shown to be worst-case optimal for the class of task defined. Experimental results are included to illustrate the feasibility of the approach.

Reference-contexts: In most applications, it is desirable that the reconstructed shape is simple, i.e., free of self-intersection. However, some existing algorithms do not guarantee this property. As pointed out in <ref> [1] </ref>, it is possible that the output of the toroidal graph method [13] can have a self-intersection for a pair of dissimilar contours, even when it is possible to construct an intersection-free shape by using the same pair of contours by a different approach. <p> For a certain pair of contours, it is not possible to construct a simple polyhedron at all only by using vertices contained in the contours [16]. Usually, this problem is avoided by adding extra vertices in the given contours in a preprocessing stage <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. * Overhangs. For a certain application such as terrain modeling, the reconstructed shape does not appear natural if it contains overhangs. <p> Also, our algorithm runs in an output-sensitive manner, in that for a pair of similar contours, it requires substantially less amount of additional vertices to be used in reconstruction. Requirement 1, which has been addressed in some past work (e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>), is critical for most applications, while Requirement 2 is relevant only when contours are nested as in Fig. 3 and is important in particular for terrain modeling. <p> These methods [5, 3] may generate flat triangles in the same level as the original contours. In such a case, the branch (bifurcation) becomes apparent only after the third level (in addition to the first and the second level contours) is processed. Bajaj et al <ref> [1] </ref> also address three problems at once. They introduce three criteria that are desirable for reconstruction from slices. The first one requires that the shape reconstructed contain no self-intersection. Secondly, any line perpendicular to the slice intersects the reconstructed surface at zero point, one point, or along one line-segment. <p> Two mappings f : X ! Y and g : X ! Y , are called homotopic if there is a continuous map H : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi X ! Y such that H (0; x) = f (x) and H (1; x) = g (x). The function H (t; x) is called a homotopy. The map H (t; x) may be viewed as a family of functions h t (x) (0 t 1). <p> In particular, during an isotopy of a simple curve the image remains simple at every stage [34]. Homotopy is an essential tool for classifying manifolds of low dimensions, while isotopy is instrumental in knot theory [25]. Fig. 4 illustrates the difference between homotopy and isotopy. Here, X is interval <ref> [0, 1] </ref> on the real line and Y is IR 2 . The figure shows a curve deforms into another curve (or a point). For homotopy, it is not necessary that the images of h t (x) remain homeomorphic to each other. <p> According to our analysis, the number of vertices added is not prohibitively high, especially for cases where contours are not severely convolved. Regarding the requirement that no intersection be produced in the reconstructed shape, the method <ref> [1] </ref> also satisfies this condition (Their input is more general in that it is not restricted to the case that one contour is enclosed by the other). <p> In case of a valley-like situation (as in Fig. 26), the valley created by our method is sloped (that is, height of the bottom of the valley decreases monotonically from the upper part to the lower part in the valley), while the method of <ref> [1] </ref> assigns a constant value for all points on the medial axis and it would require a small additional step to incorporate such a slope. right). For branching, our method require no special case analysis other than finding branch points. <p> Fig. 27 (a) illustrates the situation. This method cannot handle a situation such as in Fig. 27 (b). This is a type of input which cannot be processed by the approach of Bajaj et al either, since it violates their Condition 2 <ref> [1] </ref>. 8 Concluding Remarks 8.1 Contributions In this paper, we have introduced an isotopy-based method for shape reconstruction from contours. A provably-correct method has been presented to produce intersection-free shapes from contours. Compared to triangular tiling methods, our method requires additional vertices to be used to construct a solid shape. <p> Optimization in reconstruction: In some approach, `goodness' of reconstruction is discussed in terms of minimization of the total surface area or volume of the reconstructed shape [13, 3], while others are more concerned about correctness of reconstruction <ref> [1] </ref> or visual appearance [32]. In our present work, no attempt is made for optimization. However, such optimization may be incorporated by way of snap order sequencing. Currently, our snap order sequence is determined in a greedy manner (i.e., we pick a triangle with a largest area).

Reference-contexts: These degrees of control make it possible to handle shape reconstruction from nonparallel slices and incorporating slope information (when handling more than two successive slices at each step) in shape reconstruction. Recently, Barequet et al <ref> [2] </ref> have considered using more than two consecutive slices in their triangular tiling framework by using different triangulations depending on the branch situation encountered. Nested contours: One remaining problem is that of generating deformation paths for internal contours.

Reference-contexts: In our case, constrained triangulation is necessary, since inner polygon edges are to be used as triangulation edges. The method by Chew [7] constructs constrained Delaunay triangulation in O (n log n) time, where n is the total number of vertices. A survey by Bern and Eppstein <ref> [4] </ref> describes various other methods for triangulation. 3.2 Snapping The heart of the algorithm is elimination of the triangles. There are two cases depending on whether the triangle to be eliminated has either one or two edges on the outer loop.

Reference-contexts: Zyda et al [37] and Ekoule et al [12] use a bounding-box overlap analysis to determine correspondence. Some methods handle the three problems at once. Boissonnat <ref> [5] </ref> has used tetrahedralization of spaces between two contours by using the Delaunay triangulation of pair of successive contours.

Reference-contexts: It has been pointed out [32] that sudden changes in surface normal in triangular tiling may at times give rise to a visual artifact in reconstructed shapes. Such a discontinuity is less noticeable for rectangular tiling or free-form surfaces <ref> [6] </ref>. However, existing algorithms for rectangular tiling usually work only when contours are similar in shape and they are not guaranteed to generate intersection-free solids for an arbitrary pair of contours. <p> There are some approaches which consider nontriangular tilings such as ones using free-form surfaces. A bivariate free-form surface P (u; v) may be considered as a homotopy, where a curve parametrized in u deforms along the other dimension v to form a patch. Chang et al <ref> [6] </ref> consider using Hermite interpolation for surface description and Kehtrarnavaz et al [19] also use parametric surfaces. Shinagawa and Kunii [32] 6 use a piecewise linear homotopy model based on the toroidal graph for surface reconstruction between two contours by using a continuous version of the toroidal graph.

Reference-contexts: We now describe each step in detail. 3.1 Triangulation There are a number of methods for polygon triangulation. In our case, constrained triangulation is necessary, since inner polygon edges are to be used as triangulation edges. The method by Chew <ref> [7] </ref> constructs constrained Delaunay triangulation in O (n log n) time, where n is the total number of vertices. A survey by Bern and Eppstein [4] describes various other methods for triangulation. 3.2 Snapping The heart of the algorithm is elimination of the triangles.

Reference-contexts: Some variations have also been reported based on the toroidal graph formulation. For example, Wang and Aggarwal [35] use A* search to reconstruct surface that minimizes the total edge length. Other heuristics and applications are found in [10, 31, 33]. Christiansen and Sederberg <ref> [8] </ref> propose a greedy search approach to avoid expensive optimal graph search. After normalizing the two contours, vertices on the two contours are processed sequentially starting from some pair of vertices. <p> To avoid such a problem, extra vertices are usually added to the contours. Some authors address the correspondence problem and branching problem [26, 12] in addition to the tiling problem. Christiansen and Sederberg <ref> [8] </ref> have proposed to introduce a mid-point between two contours on the same level. The mid-point is used to unite the two contours into one so that existing tiling methods may be applied. <p> In case there is more than a single highest intersection point, we use a united contour to define a branch curve. Thus, no special treatment is necessary for the U-shaped contour which is difficult to handle in some approach <ref> [8] </ref>. 7.2 Snap strategies There are a few choices as to how to carry out snap operations outlined in Section 3. For an edge snap as in Fig. 6 (b), K can be anywhere between P i and P i+1 to satisfy Requirement 1 (no self-intersecting shape).

Reference-contexts: We now take a look at the case with vertex correspondence. Suppose there are c pairs of vertex correspondences. It takes O (n log n) time to generate a path within a triangulated polygon, since the induced connectivity graph has O (n) vertices and edges <ref> [11] </ref>. Thus, it takes O (cn log n) time to generate c vertex paths and the resulting triangulation is of O (cn) in size.

Reference-contexts: The method runs fast and works well for a pair of similar contours, but may fail to produce a reasonable shape for dissimilar contours as pointed out in <ref> [12] </ref>. O'Rourke [28] points out that for such normalization, it is best to use a uniform scaling to avoid anomaly. Some approaches emphasize matching geometrically similar portions of contours more than minimization of a global quantity. <p> A graph search is performed to find an optimal solution in the Levenshtein graph and triangular tiling is constructed between matched contour parts. Ekoule, Peyrin and Odet <ref> [12] </ref> also analyze given contours to find similarity between the contours. They decompose the contour in a hierarchical manner based on convex and concave parts along the contours. Triangulation is then performed by using the information obtained such that similar parts are linked together. <p> They show that for an arbitrary pair of contours it is not always possible to construct a triangular tiling without self-intersection. To avoid such a problem, extra vertices are usually added to the contours. Some authors address the correspondence problem and branching problem <ref> [26, 12] </ref> in addition to the tiling problem. Christiansen and Sederberg [8] have proposed to introduce a mid-point between two contours on the same level. The mid-point is used to unite the two contours into one so that existing tiling methods may be applied. <p> Meyers et al [26] consider a strategy similar to the approach by Christiansen and Sederberg for the branching problem, while for the correspondence problem they use the minimum spanning tree approach after approximating the contours by elliptical bounding shapes. Zyda et al [37] and Ekoule et al <ref> [12] </ref> use a bounding-box overlap analysis to determine correspondence. Some methods handle the three problems at once. Boissonnat [5] has used tetrahedralization of spaces between two contours by using the Delaunay triangulation of pair of successive contours. <p> Such a consideration helps to preserve some geometric landmarks such as ridges in reconstruction. It can also be used to prevent a pathline to become long and winding. Finding matching features may be done by various methods (e.g., <ref> [12, 17, 18] </ref>) and it is not discussed in this paper. We take the following steps to incorporate vertex correspondences. The general idea is illustrated in Fig. 11. 1. Generate a polyline (called a vertex path) connecting corresponding vertices. 2.

Reference-contexts: In general, these approaches work well for a pair of contours that are similar in shape. However, their performance for interpolation between dissimilar shapes is not well-understood. Fujimura and Makarov <ref> [14] </ref> propose a homotopic image morphing method that preserves a topological invariant. <p> In the latter case, an isotopy is constructed based on the existing triangulation scheme and it makes it possible to add vertex correspondence in the existing framework. Contour-to-contour isotopy can be extended to an isotopy of interiors. Previously, we have studied a method <ref> [14] </ref> for constructing such an isotopy. Such a consideration is of interest when the internal area is to be interpolated as well as the exterior contour. 8.2 Future work We now list a number of directions in which our framework may be extended.

Reference-contexts: In such a case, using a path planner in shape reconstruction may be 24 useful. One such approach, where shape blending is performed amidst environmental obstacles, is described in <ref> [24] </ref>. Optimization in reconstruction: In some approach, `goodness' of reconstruction is discussed in terms of minimization of the total surface area or volume of the reconstructed shape [13, 3], while others are more concerned about correctness of reconstruction [1] or visual appearance [32].

Reference-contexts: In particular, during an isotopy of a simple curve the image remains simple at every stage [34].

Fig. 4 illustrates the difference between homotopy and isotopy. Here, X is interval [0, 1] on the real line and Y is IR 2 . The figure shows a curve deforms into another curve (or a point).

Reference-contexts: They show that for an arbitrary pair of contours it is not always possible to construct a triangular tiling without self-intersection. To avoid such a problem, extra vertices are usually added to the contours. Some authors address the correspondence problem and branching problem <ref> [26, 12] </ref> in addition to the tiling problem. Christiansen and Sederberg [8] have proposed to introduce a mid-point between two contours on the same level. The mid-point is used to unite the two contours into one so that existing tiling methods may be applied. <p> The mid-point is used to unite the two contours into one so that existing tiling methods may be applied. This approach faces some difficulty when the projection of the midpoint does not fall inside of the other contour. Meyers et al <ref> [26] </ref> consider a strategy similar to the approach by Christiansen and Sederberg for the branching problem, while for the correspondence problem they use the minimum spanning tree approach after approximating the contours by elliptical bounding shapes.

Reference-contexts: Let Z be the zone between P and Q. Reconstruction Algorithm 1. (Triangulation) Triangulate the area Z using vertices of P and Q. It is always possible to triangulate planar polygons by using only vertices of P and Q (i.e., without using any additional vertices) <ref> [27] </ref>. 2. (Snapping) Eliminate triangles of zone Z one by one in an outer-to-inner fashion. Each time a triangle is eliminated, the outer layer shrinks by using one of the snapping operations described below.

Reference-contexts: The method runs fast and works well for a pair of similar contours, but may fail to produce a reasonable shape for dissimilar contours as pointed out in [12]. O'Rourke <ref> [28] </ref> points out that for such normalization, it is best to use a uniform scaling to avoid anomaly. Some approaches emphasize matching geometrically similar portions of contours more than minimization of a global quantity.

Reference-contexts: In general, these approaches work well for a pair of contours that are similar in shape. However, their performance for interpolation between dissimilar shapes is not well-understood. Fujimura and Makarov [14] propose a homotopic image morphing method that preserves a topological invariant. Rosenfeld and Nakamura <ref> [29] </ref> investigate homotopic deformation in digital geometry. 3 Reconstruction Method To present our basic idea, we assume that we are given a pair of closed simple contours that lie in parallel slices and that one contour is strictly contained in the other when they are projected in a common plane parallel

Reference-contexts: Some variations have also been reported based on the toroidal graph formulation. For example, Wang and Aggarwal [35] use A* search to reconstruct surface that minimizes the total edge length. Other heuristics and applications are found in <ref> [10, 31, 33] </ref>. Christiansen and Sederberg [8] propose a greedy search approach to avoid expensive optimal graph search. After normalizing the two contours, vertices on the two contours are processed sequentially starting from some pair of vertices.

Reference-contexts: Although this model is effective for many reconstruction problems in which consecutive contours are similar in shape, it is subject to some remarks as follows. * Discontinuity in surface normal. It has been pointed out <ref> [32] </ref> that sudden changes in surface normal in triangular tiling may at times give rise to a visual artifact in reconstructed shapes. Such a discontinuity is less noticeable for rectangular tiling or free-form surfaces [6]. <p> Chang et al [6] consider using Hermite interpolation for surface description and Kehtrarnavaz et al [19] also use parametric surfaces. Shinagawa and Kunii <ref> [32] </ref> 6 use a piecewise linear homotopy model based on the toroidal graph for surface reconstruction between two contours by using a continuous version of the toroidal graph. In general, these approaches work well for a pair of contours that are similar in shape. <p> Optimization in reconstruction: In some approach, `goodness' of reconstruction is discussed in terms of minimization of the total surface area or volume of the reconstructed shape [13, 3], while others are more concerned about correctness of reconstruction [1] or visual appearance <ref> [32] </ref>. In our present work, no attempt is made for optimization. However, such optimization may be incorporated by way of snap order sequencing. Currently, our snap order sequence is determined in a greedy manner (i.e., we pick a triangle with a largest area).

Reference-contexts: Such a homotopy is called a straight-line homotopy. An isotopy is a homotopy h t for which every h t (x) is a homeomorphism. In particular, during an isotopy of a simple curve the image remains simple at every stage <ref> [34] </ref>. Homotopy is an essential tool for classifying manifolds of low dimensions, while isotopy is instrumental in knot theory [25]. Fig. 4 illustrates the difference between homotopy and isotopy.

Reference-contexts: They decompose the contour in a hierarchical manner based on convex and concave parts along the contours. Triangulation is then performed by using the information obtained such that similar parts are linked together. Welzl and Wolfers <ref> [36] </ref> have posed two criteria for surface reconstruction different from those considered above. The first condition requires that if two contours are convex, then the surface is the convex hull of 4 the contours.
