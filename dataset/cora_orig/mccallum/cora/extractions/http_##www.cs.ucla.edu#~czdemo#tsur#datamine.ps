Abstract: This paper presents an overview of data mining techniques in the context of of the deductive-inductive cycle model. The claim made in this paper is that a combination of both of these modes of inference in one model offers adavantages over the exclusive use of either induction or deduction. After an introduction of this model the paper describes an architecture of the Knowledge Miner environment and its relation to the LDL++ deductive database technology. In particular, it defines the notion of a meta query and shows how this concept can be used to take advantage of the full power of a deductive data base system. The paper describes a number of inductive methods that can be used within this framework and describes some data mining experiments performed with the Knowledge Miner.

Reference-contexts: In order to relate these methods to other research in the field, particularly the work done by Agrawal et al <ref> [AIS93] </ref>, we have adopted an object-oriented nomenclature. The universe to be explored or mined for knowledge is determined by the results of the execution of an instantiated meta-query. It is assumed to consist of a set of objects, each of which is characterized by a set of attributes. <p> : : ; o:A n is equivalent to o (A 1 ; A 2 ; : : : ; A n ) in relational notation. 9 5.2 Associations The following example is typical of an association that is derived from transaction data, collected at points of sale in a supermarket <ref> [AIS93, HS95] </ref>: "if bread and butter are purchased in a transaction then plausibly, milk is also purchased." Example Supermarket Association purchase (T; bread); purchase (T; butter) ) purchase (T; milk) where purchase (T; X) is a normalized database relation of all items X purchased in a transaction T . <p> This strategy is also implemented and improved in the C4 program, included in the IND tree package [Bun91]. CDP (Classifier with Dynamic Pruning) <ref> [AIS93] </ref> is another prototype data mining system designed at IBM as part of the Quest project. The system, which is designed to analyze both classification, association and sequence problems, is built around a small set of basic primitives that can be combined in the iterative process described above.

Reference-contexts: next section we will provide a brief overview of the LDL++ system, which is used to implement the deductive (elaboration and database) part of the Knowledge Miner|a Database Mining Environment [SOMZ94, SOMC96], that will be described in the sequel. 3.1 The LDL++ Deductive Database System The LDL++ Deductive Database System <ref> [AOTZ] </ref>, is the successor to the LDL system that was built at MCC, Austin, TX. In its design, the system has benefited extensively from the experience gained with the previous system and its architecture is depicted in Fig. 2.

Reference-contexts: This method assumes the existence of additional knowledge in the form of classification hierarchies on the attributes of the data. Algorithms for abstraction are described by Han et al [HCC93] and a data mining system employing abstraction methods is described by Dhar and Tuzhilin <ref> [DT93] </ref>. The following is an abstraction example described in their paper.

The paper provides a performance comparisons for classification tests done using the IND package and this system. Houtsma <ref> [HS95] </ref> describes methods for the encoding of set-oriented mining for associations into SQL queries and provides some performance figures. 7 The Knowledge Base The knowledge base accumulates the knowledge that is gathered during the inductive data analysis.

Reference-contexts: One of our objectives is to present these ideas in a uniform and consistent fashion. We will develop therefore a model of the database mining process that can be used for this purpose. Matheus et al <ref> [MCPS93] </ref> describe a generic architecture for Knowledge Discovery in Databases. In their scheme, high-level patterns are translated to database queries which are executed and return results. Subsequently, the results are focused, analyzed for existing patterns, evaluated and returned as discoveries.

Reference-contexts: Examples of data mining applications include: * The analysis of airline seat reservation data for patterns of commercial value. * Chip production data for the identification of flaws in the manufacturing process. * Communication network management data for anomalous behavior, e.g., the "convoy" problem <ref> [NT89] </ref> * Scientific data analysis; e.g., electrophoresis gel data for DNA sequence identification. * Analysis of retail and other marketing data for timely identification of consumer trends. We will elaborate on applications of this type in the sequel. * Data base schema integration. <p> A great deal of research effort went into the design of efficient compilation and optimization techniques for the transformation of the extensional queries into efficient plans for accessing the stored data. We will assume a certain degree of familiarity with Deductive Database technology.

Reference-contexts: As is with all meta forms, a strength is associated with the classification. Example Classification This example is due to Quinlan <ref> [Qui86] </ref>. Assume that the universe of interest is a set of "Saturday morning" objects. <p> In practice however the number of candidate structures can grow to a very large number and therefore the "generate and select" approach is impractical and an incremental approach is adopted. The ID3 system <ref> [Qui86] </ref> is a classification system that is designed to operate with training sets having many objects, each of which has many attributes. The classification tree construction is an iterative process that starts by selecting a small subset from the training set. This subset is called a window.
