Abstract: We characterize the conditions under which completing a Delaunay tessellation produces a configuration that is a nondegenerate Delaunay triangulation of an arbitrarily small perturbation of the original sites. One consequence of this result is a simple postpro-cessing step for resolving degeneracies in Delaunay triangulations that does not require symbolic perturbation of the data. We also give an example showing that if a set of points has a degenerate Delaunay tessellation, the globally equiangular triangulation is not necessarily realizable as the nondegenerate Delaunay triangulation of a perturbation of the sites.

Let S be a set of generating sites, DT (S) its Delaunay tessellation.

Reference-contexts: If exact computation is used, our algorithm produces a triangulation that is guaranteed to be the (nondegenerate) Delaunay triangulation of an arbitrarily small perturbation of the input. 2 Preliminaries Except as noted, we use the graph-theoretical notation and definitions of <ref> [2] </ref>. In particular, V (G) and E (G) denote the set of vertices and edges of a graph G, respectively. A triangulation is a 2-connected plane graph in which all faces except possibly the outer face are bounded by triangles.

Reference-contexts: The following lemma describes the connection between Delaunay tessellations and inscribable graphs. It is a different formulation from that in <ref> [3] </ref>. The operation of stellating a face f in a plane graph G consists of adding a vertex inside the face f and then connecting all vertices incident on f to the new vertex.

Reference-contexts: A triangulation is a 2-connected plane graph in which all faces except possibly the outer face are bounded by triangles. A maximal planar graph is a planar graph in which all faces (including the outer face) are bounded by triangles. A graph G is 1-tough <ref> [4] </ref> if for all nonempty S V (G), c (G S) jSj. (Here j j denotes cardinality, and c () denotes the number of connected components.) G is 1-supertough if, for all S V (G) with jSj 2, c (G S) &lt; jSj.

Reference-contexts: See <ref> [5] </ref> for a discussion of stereographic projection. 5 Proof of Theorem 3.1 In this section, we prove Theorem 3.1. We first establish the circumstances under which adding an edge to an inscribable graph preserves inscribability. Theorem 5.1 Let G be an inscribable graph.

Reference-contexts: In the worst case, O (jSj) operations are required. It is never necessary to perform more than one edge deletion and one edge addition. 8 A Delaunay Realizability Theorem It was shown in <ref> [6] </ref> that any triangulation of a simple polygon (that is, any triangulation obtained by adding diagonals to the interior of a simple polygon) is combinatorially realizable as a nondegenerate Delaunay triangulation.

Indeed, only an exponentially small fraction of triangulations have such a realization [24]. Hence one would expect that some care is necessary when removing degeneracies from Delaunay triangulations and indeed, this turns out to be the case. <p> DT (S) in a non-weakly-symmetric fashion are shown on the right of the figure. Neither of these triangulations is realizable as a Delaunay triangulation, as they fail to satisfy the necessary conditions of Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 of <ref> [7] </ref>, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Edelsbrunner has defined a globally equiangular triangulation to be a triangulation that maximizes lexicographically the angle sequence (sorted in increasing order) <ref> [9] </ref>. Mount and Saalfeld have given an efficient algorithm to compute the globally equiangular triangulation of a set of cocircular points [17].

Let S be a set of generating sites, DT (S) its Delaunay tessellation. <p> Theorem 8.1 implies that any triangulation of a cocircular planar point set is a valid Delaunay triangulation, and 8 hence any globally equiangular triangulation of a cocircular point set is a valid Delaunay triangulation. It is shown on <ref> [9, page 302] </ref> that any globally equiangular triangulation is necessarily a completion of the Delaunay tessellation. Here we show that a globally equiangular triangulation need not be a valid completion of the Delaunay tessellation. Consider the (degenerate) Delaunay tessellation shown in Figure 3 (a).
