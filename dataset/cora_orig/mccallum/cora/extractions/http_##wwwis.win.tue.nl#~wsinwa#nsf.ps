Reference-contexts: However, it is also possible to use techniques which exploit the structure of the underlying Petri net. For example, we can generate place invariants to verify safety properties. We also developed an analy 4 sis technique which verifies in polynomial time whether the workflow procedure satisfies the following requirements <ref> [1] </ref>: * There are no `dangling tasks', i.e. tasks which do not contribute to the pro cessing of cases. * For any case, the procedure will terminate eventually. (Given some fairness assumption.) * The moment the procedure terminates for a specific case, all references to this case have been removed.

Reference-contexts: It can be shown that a Petri net can be used to model the primitives identified by the WFMC [8]. Figure 1 shows how the six workflow primitives identified by the WFMC can be mapped onto Petri nets <ref> [2] </ref>. Tasks are mapped onto transitions and causal relations are modeled by places. These primitives are also 1 present in today's WFMSs. Many of today's available WFMSs provide ah-hoc constructs to model workflow procedures. Moreover, there are WFMSs that impose restrictions on the workflow primitives shown in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: One of the main reasons for this is the absence of a conceptual framework for workflow management. Such is a framework is very important. Recall what the impact of the Relational Data Model [4] and the Entity-Relationship Model <ref> [3] </ref> had on database management software. In our opinion, a Petri-net-based framework for workflow management could serve as a conceptual standard for the modeling and analysis of workflow. <p> This situation of disorder and lack of consensus resulted in an incomprehensive set of DBMSs. However, emerging standards such as the Relational Data Model [4] and the Entity-Relationship Model <ref> [3] </ref> lead to a common formal basis for many DBMSs. As a result the use of these DBMS boosted. There are many similarities between today's WFMSs and the DBMSs of the early 70-ties. Despite the efforts of the Workflow Management Coalition a real conceptual standard is missing.

Reference-contexts: Despite the efforts of the Workflow Management Coalition (WFMC) [8], standardization is lacking.

In our opinion, a Petri-net-based framework for workflow management could serve as a conceptual standard for the modeling and analysis of workflow. <p> In the beginning of the 70-ties most of the pioneers in the field of DBMSs were using their own ad-hoc concepts.

In this way it is possible to evaluate alternative workflows.

Reference-contexts: This signifies that the term `workflow management' is not just another buzzword. The phenomenon workflow management will have a tremendous impact on the next generation of information systems. Nevertheless, work-flow management is still in its infancy. Despite the efforts of the Workflow Management Coalition (WFMC) <ref> [8] </ref>, standardization is lacking. One of the main reasons for this is the absence of a conceptual framework for workflow management. Such is a framework is very important.
