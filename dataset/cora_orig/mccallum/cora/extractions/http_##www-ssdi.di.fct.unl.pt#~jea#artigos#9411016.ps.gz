Title: EXTENDING DRT WITH A FOCUSING MECHANISM FOR PRONOMINAL ANAPHORAANDELLIPSIS RESOLUTION  
Author: Jos Abraos, Jos Gabriel Lopes CRIA/UNINOVA, Faculdade de Cincias e Tecnologia, Monteda Caparica, Portugal 
Abstract: Cormack (1992) proposed a framework for pronominal anaphora resolution. Her proposal integrates focusing theory (Sidner et al.) and DRT (Kamp and Reyle). We analyzed this methodology and adjusted it to the processing of Portuguese texts. The scope of the framework was widened to cover sentences containing restrictive relative clauses and subject ellipsis. Tests were conceived and applied to probe the adequacy of proposed modifications when dealing with processing of current texts.

Reference-contexts: The choice of antecedents is based on pragmatic constraints, which put an ordering on preferences between antecedent candidates. Cormack proposes the integration of focusing and DRT, "(...) adding semantic constraints to a model of attention in discourse" <ref> (Cormack, 1992 p.5) </ref>. This integration compensates for two shortcomings of DRT: it considers too many possibilities for anaphoric binding and doesn't provide an ordering between antecedent candidates. <p> Referents not fitting any of these two groups can be forgotten.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, any system aiming at efficiency in anaphora resolution should minimize the role of inference. As far as DRT is concerned, the construction rule for pronouns states that the referent introduced by the pronoun should be bound to a suitable referent, chosen among those that are accessible <ref> (Kamp and Reyle, 1993 p.122) </ref>. The accessibility is based on semantic constraints and is expressed by the structure of DRS representing the text. However the suitability of referents is ill-defined. <p> Relative clauses as conditionals Both Kamp (1993 p.81) and Cormack (1992 p.347) propose a "flat" treatment of relative clauses.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Pronominal anaphora resolution, as part of a more general process of anaphora resolution, is a determinant step in constructing a semantic representation of a text. Although "general cognitive processes DO play a role in establishing anaphoric dependencies (...)" <ref> (Kempson, 1990 p.14) </ref>, inference is, in computational terms, a very expensive process, both for the amount of processing involved and for the extension of the knowledge bases required. Therefore, any system aiming at efficiency in anaphora resolution should minimize the role of inference. <p> However the suitability of referents is ill-defined. Another perspective for anaphora resolution is founded on the principle of relevance, i.e. on "the presumption that every utterance is selected to convey the intended interpretation while imposing to the hearer the least amount of processing effort in constructing that interpretation" <ref> (Kempson 1990 p.17) </ref>. Focusing/ centering theories (Grosz; Sidner; Brennan, Friedman and Pollard et al.) can be considered as having this perspective. They try to keep track of the focus of attention along the text and bind pronouns preferentially to focused entities.
