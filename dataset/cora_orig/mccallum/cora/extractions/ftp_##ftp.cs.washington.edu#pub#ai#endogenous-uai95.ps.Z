Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic model for rea soning about the state of a system as it changes over time, both due to exogenous and endogenous influences. Our target domain is a class of medical prediction problems that are neither so urgent as to preclude careful diagnosis nor progress so slowly as to allow arbitrary testing and treatment options. In these domains there is typically enough time to gather information about the patient's state and consider alternative diagnoses and treatments, but the temporal interaction between the timing of tests, treatments, and the course of the disease must also be considered. Our approach is to elicit a qualitative structural model of the patient from a human expert|the model identifies important attributes, the way in which exogenous changes affect attribute values, and the way in which the patient's condition changes endogenously. We then elicit probabilistic information to capture the expert's uncertainty about the effects of tests and treatments and the nature and timing of endogenous state changes. This paper describes the model in the context of a problem in treating vehicle accident trauma, and suggests a method for solving the model based on the technique of sequential imputation. A complementary goal of this work is to understand and synthesize a disparate collection of research efforts all using the name "probabilistic temporal reasoning." This paper analyzes related work and points out essential differences between our proposed model and other approaches in the literature.

We suspect that the difference between the two approaches derives from assumptions made about how the models are to be elicited. In much of the latter work, e.g. <ref> [ Dagum and Galper, 1993 ] </ref> , it is assumed that significant parts of the model, most notably temporal relationships, are going to be inferred from data rather than elicited directly from an expert.

This event model can be used to build graphical structures that can in turn be used to reason about temporal problems. In our example we have three events: collision C, observe vital signs OVS and observe pupil dilation OPD.

Reference-contexts: There is a close similarity between the concept of a process in Qualitative Process Theory <ref> [ Forbus, 1984 ] </ref> and our tables of exogenous influences: both dictate that sets of attributes being in a particular state will tend to exert upward or downward pressure on the values of other attributes.

Reference-contexts: Our current implementation employs the technique of sequential imputation <ref> [ Kong et al., 1994 ] </ref> , which has the additional advantage that we can extend the scenario (by adding new exogenous events) without having to discard the results of previous trials. 5.1 Sequential Imputation Sequential imputation is an importance sampling technique that allows for incremental absorption of new observations.

See <ref> [ Provan, 1993 ] </ref> for a discussion. This approach is strikingly different from ours: our model is built entirely from eliciting a diachronic or process-oriented model of the domain. Synchronic relationships are not directly elicited, but are inferred from the diachronic model.
