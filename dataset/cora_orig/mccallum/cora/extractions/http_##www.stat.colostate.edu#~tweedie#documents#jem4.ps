Title: SIMULATING THE INVARIANT MEASURES OF MARKOV CHAINS USING BACKWARD COUPLING AT REGENERATION TIMES  
Author: S.G. Foss, R. L. Tweedie and J.N. Corcoran 
Affiliation: Institute of Mathematics, Novosibirsk and Colorado State University  
Abstract: We develop an algorithm for simulating approximate random samples from the invariant measure of a Markov chain using backward coupling of embedded regeneration times. Related methods have been used effectively for finite chains and for stochastically monotone chains: here we propose a method of implementation which avoids these restrictions by using a "cycle-length" truncation. We show that the coupling times have good theoretical properties and describe benefits and difficulties of implementing the methods in practice.

Customers arrive at server 1 according to a Poisson process of rate , are served with an exponential service rate 1 , and proceed to server 2. <p> When introducing buffer priority scheduling policies into a queueing network, it is not immediately clear that the typical traffic intensity constraints (in this case, 1 &lt; 1 and 2 &lt; 1) are sufficient for stability. Down and Meyn <ref> [3] </ref> have shown that this particular three buffer system is stable without further parameter restrictions. If the N 1 customers were not being blocked from service by the N 3 customers, we would have a simple M/M/1 model with traffic intensity = = 1 at the N 1 buffer.

Reference-contexts: This assumption is true for irreducible countable space chains, and by using the Nummelin splitting construction (see Meyn and Tweedie <ref> [14] </ref>) it can be made to hold for all -irreducible chains (that is, for those such that whenever (A) &gt; 0, for any x we will have some n such that P n (x; A) &gt; 0). <p> The chain X is clearly determined by the function f , which is essentially found by inverting the distribution functions of the transition laws from x. Note that algebraic conditions for stability of such models in a wide range of cases are given in <ref> [14, Chapter7] </ref>, although the full generality of the SRS approach is not considered there. <p> Since Z is a probability measure, we get immediately that Z (0; 0) = [1 + n1 as required.

Remark Note that use of the bivariate chain gives a constructive approach to the structure of used in (16).

Reference-contexts: Many chains of interest in statistical physics or operations research satisfy such stochastic monotonicity properties, and in Propp and Wilson <ref> [18] </ref> and Lund and Wilson [13] the approach is investigated in those contexts. In this paper we develop a variation on this algorithm which can be used when the chain is not finite or monotone, and which does not require a "vertical coupling" starting from all states. <p> We show in Section 2.2 that this scheme is viable and derive moments for the time needed for such coupling to be successful. However, unlike the finite or monotone cases in Propp and Wilson <ref> [18] </ref> and related papers, it is not the case that one can tell in implemention when the horizontal backward coupling has succeeded, and in Section 3 we introduce the idea of "cycle-truncation" that leads to a simple implementation scheme. <p> In two cases at least, this is known to be computationally feasible: when the chain is finite, or when it is stochastically monotone on a space with a maximal and a mininal element. Such situations are covered in more detail in Propp and Wilson <ref> [18] </ref> and in Foss and Tweedie [6]. When this does not occur other methods of constructing or modifying verifiable backward coupling times are needed. <p> Note that although this is a stochastically monotone chain it has no maximal element so the original coupling-from-the-past algorithms of Propp and Wilson <ref> [18] </ref> cannot be used. We executed the horizontal backward coupling algorithm, and present some of the results for p = 0:3 and for various N, the maximum cycle length before truncation of the sample path, in Table 1, together with the true values of (k).
