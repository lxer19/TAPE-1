Abstract: Over the past several years, a community of researchers has been using and refining a particular framework for research and curriculum development in undergraduate mathematics education. The purpose of this paper is to share the results of this work with the mathematics education community at large by describing the current version of the framework and giving some examples of its application. Our framework utilizes qualitative methods for research and is based on a very specific theoretical perspective that is being developed through attempts to understand the ideas of Piaget concerning reflective abstraction and reconstruct them in the context of college level mathematics. Our approach has three components. It begins with an initial theoretical analysis of what it means to understand a concept and how that understanding can be constructed by the learner. This leads to the design of an instructional treatment that focuses directly on trying to get students to make the constructions called for by the analysis. Implementation of instruction leads to the gathering of data, which is then analyzed in the context of the theoretical perspective. The researchers cycle through the three components and refine both the theory and the instructional treatments as needed. In this report the authors present detailed descriptions of each of these components. In our discussion of theoretical analyses, we describe certain mental constructions for learning mathematics, including actions, processes, objects, and schemas, and the relationships among these constructions. Under instructional treatment, we describe the components of the ACE teaching cycle (activities, class discussion, and exercises), cooperative learning and the use of a mathematical programming language. Finally, we describe the methodology used in data collection and analysis. The paper concludes with a discussion of issues raised in the use of this framework, followed by an extensive bibliography.

Reference-contexts: According to our theoretical perspective, a major reason for the difficulty is that the learner is not able to go beyond an action conception of function and all of these notions require process and/or object conceptions. (See <ref> [1] </ref> for an elaboration of these issues.) Another example of an action conception comes from the notion of a (left or right) coset of a group in abstract algebra. <p> With a process conception of function, an individual can link two or more processes to construct a composition, or reverse the process to obtain inverse functions <ref> [1] </ref>. 7 In abstract algebra, a process understanding of cosets includes thinking about the formation of a set by operating a fixed element with every element in a particular subgroup. Again, it is not necessary to perform the operations, but only to think about them being performed. <p> Research suggests that students who write code to implement the point-wise sum, product, and composition of functions tend to make progress in developing a process conception of function <ref> [1] </ref>. Programming activities have also been used to help students get past the well-known difficulty many have in seeing that a piece-wise defined function is still a function, and that properties can be studied at the seam points as well as other places. <p> It appears that writing and working with a program that he or she has written helps the student make concrete the ideas embodied in the program. Indirect effects of working with the computer One example of an indirect effect on students is reported in <ref> [1] </ref>. Students were asked at the beginning of a discrete mathematics course to give examples of functions.

Reference-contexts: We believe that it is important today that those who study the learning of post-secondary mathematics attempt to make available to others the methodologies under which they work. 1.2 Previous discussions of this framework Components of our framework have been discussed in several papers over the last several years: <ref> [2] </ref>, [5], [7], [8].

Our use of programming activities to help students form schemas to organize collections of individual constructs and other schemas is, at the time of this writing, somewhat ad hoc. Some progress is being made, and has been reported in <ref> [2] </ref> for a limit schema. Roughly speaking, we ask students to write a set of computer programs that implements a mathematical concept and then to apply their code to specific situations.

Reference-contexts: One approach would be to try to make inferences from these reactions about the actual thinking processes of the respondent. We reject this because there is no way that we could check our inferences. Rather, we take something of the view of Glasersfeld <ref> [13] </ref> and consider only whether our description of the mental constructions is compatible with the responses that we observe. That is, we ask only whether our theoretical analysis is a reasonable explanation of the comments and written work of the student.

Reference-contexts: In this respect our theoretical framework is like its underlying radical constructivist perspective which Glasersfeld notes, "is intended, not as a metaphysical conjecture, but as a conceptual tool whose value can be gauged only by using it <ref> [14] </ref>." All we can do is try to make sense out of the individual's reactions to various phenomena. One approach would be to try to make inferences from these reactions about the actual thinking processes of the respondent.

In this case, the functions are defined graphically rather than analytically. It would be interesting to see whether the theoretical framework we are using would apply in the same way to describe student understanding of functions.

Finally, we summarize what has been said in this paper and point to what can be expected in future reports. 1.1 What is a paradigm and why is one needed? The seminal work of Thomas Kuhn <ref> [19] </ref> teaches us that scientific research proceeds according to what he calls paradigms. 2 A paradigm is a collection of understandings (explicit or implicit) on the part of an individual or group of individuals about the kinds of things one does when conducting research in a particular field, the types of

Reference-contexts: In considering the variety of approaches being used, there are two aspects which must be addressed. The first is the theoretical perspective taken by the researchers using a particular approach, and the second is the set of actual methods by which data is collected and analyzed. Patton <ref> [20] </ref> lists some of the theoretical perspectives used by qualitative researchers. <p> He also discusses observational methods ranging from videotaping to the use of trained observers to participant observations. Patton <ref> [20] </ref> discusses other sources of data, including documents and files which may be available to the researcher, photographs and diagrams of the setting in which the research takes place, and the researchers' field notes. 3 Thus we see that there is a wide variety of frameworks in which it is possible <p> The overall framework with its three components have been discussed at length, especially the theoretical component, but only very fragmented discussions of the other two components, instructional treatments and 3 For information on qualitative methods used in the social sciences see Jacob [17], or Patton <ref> [20] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Then the reconstruction is not exactly the same as what existed previously, and may in fact contain one or more advances to a more sophisticated level. This whole notion is related to the well known Piagetian dichotomy of assimilation and accommodation <ref> [21] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Students are organized at the beginning of the semester in small groups of three to five to do all of the course work (computer lab, class discussion, homework and some exams) cooperatively. For details see <ref> [23] </ref>. One consequence of having students work in cooperative groups is that they are more likely to reflect on the procedures that they perform [32]. <p> For example, the student might be asked in the interview to explain what was written, or if he or she wished to revise the response. If the written instrument were administered to a group (as in a group examination such as described in <ref> [23] </ref>), we would ask whether the interviewee was fully in accord with and understood the group response. Individuals are selected for interview based on their responses. The idea is that it may not be necessary to interview all of the students who gave a certain written response.

Reference-contexts: When confronted with a mathematical problem situation, it has frequently been observed that an individual is not always able to bring to bear specific ideas in her or his mathematical repertoire. (See, for instance, <ref> [25] </ref> for a very sharp example of students clearly possessing certain knowledge, but not being able to use it.) An individual's mathematical knowledge consists in a tendency to use certain constructions, but not all relevant constructions are recalled in every situation.

Reference-contexts: In fact, according to our theoretical perspective, the growth of understanding is highly non-linear with starts and stops; the student develops partial understandings, repeatedly returns to the same piece of knowledge, and periodically summarizes and ties related ideas together <ref> [27] </ref>. Our general instructional approach acknowledges this growth pattern by using what we call an holistic spray, which is a variation on the standard spiral method ([10]). In this variation, students are thrust into an intentionally disequilibrating environment which contains as much as possible about the material being studied. <p> We believe that our framework offers an alternative to the approach used by some researchers (see, for example, <ref> [27] </ref>) who attempt to make a full analysis of the total set of data. In the following paragraphs we begin by discussing the goals of our analyses of interviews and then describe the specific steps by which we attempt to achieve these goals.
