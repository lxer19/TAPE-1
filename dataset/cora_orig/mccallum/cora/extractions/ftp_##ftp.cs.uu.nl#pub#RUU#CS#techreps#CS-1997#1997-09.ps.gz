Title: The Intrinsic Structure of Optic Flow Incorporating Measurement Duality  
Author: Luc Florack Wiro Niessen Mads Nielsen 
Abstract: The purpose of this report 1 is to define optic flow for scalar and density images without using a priori knowledge other than its defining conservation principle, and to incorporate measurement duality, notably the scale-space paradigm. It is argued that the design of optic flow based applications may benefit from a manifest separation between factual image structure on the one hand, and goal-specific details and hypotheses about image flow formation on the other. The approach is based on a physical symmetry principle known as gauge invariance. Data-independent models can be incorporated by means of admissible gauge conditions, each of which may single out a distinct solution, but all of which must be compatible with the evidence supported by the image data. The theory is illustrated by examples and verified by simulations, and performance is compared to several techniques reported in the literature.

Reference-contexts: We also describe a quantitative study on a benchmark sequence, and compare performance with results from existing techniques as reported by Barron et al. <ref> [7] </ref>. We summarise results in Section 6 and discuss some aspects relevant for applications and future development. 2 Preliminaries This section serves to introduce some preliminary concepts that are essential in order to appreciate the precise definition of optic flow, which will be presented in the next section. <p> The gauge invariant subsystem, on the other hand, is fully determined by a data driven feedforward procedure, and is basically a kinematic reformatting of spatiotemporal image data. 2.3 Computational Problems There are many possible approaches to optic flow measurement <ref> [7, 36] </ref>, not all of which have been investigated in-depth. The classical approach based on the OFCE defines the optic flow vector field locally by means of a conservation law; invariant grey-values are attributed to points which are dragged along the flow. <p> In Section 5.2 we compare the performance of zeroth and first order optic flow schemes to those reported by Barron et al. <ref> [7] </ref>, using an appropriate gauge condition. 5.1 Conceptual Comparison with Similar Methods Upon first glance there is nothing remarkable about the linear systems in Section 4.3 (or Result 1 in general) when compared to similar ones proposed in the literature. <p> spatial derivatives are considered." Technically, however, Werkhoven and Koenderink's approach is probably the one that comes nearest to ours, as it is in fact a gauge constrained instance. 5.2 Performance Comparison with Similar Methods Barron et al. have compared the performance of nine optic flow techniques reported in the literature <ref> [7] </ref>. <p> In this section we evaluate zeroth and first order approximations for the two image sequences known as the Translating Tree Sequence (TTS) and the Diverging Tree Sequence (DTS), respectively <ref> [7, 16] </ref>: are the zeroth order coefficients in the polynomial expansion, again without explicit reference to the value of approximation order M , and subscripts x and y denote corresponding derivatives or polynomial coefficients. <p> We have also computed a velocity field based on the scale selection criterion for these scales. In order to be able to compare results we use the same angular error measure " as proposed by Fleet and Jepson [16], and used by Barron et al. <ref> [7] </ref>, which is based on the spatiotemporal orientation of the measured vector v e relative to that of the correct vector v c (recall that v = (1; u; v)): " = arccos (bv c bv e ) with bv = v v v Although we have maintained confidence measures with <p> We have compared the performance of our algorithm with the results reported by Barron et al. <ref> [7] </ref> (for details the reader is referred to the literature). Table 2 concerns methods in which all vectors are maintained ("density = 100%"). Our OFCE method compares favourably with these approaches. This should not come as a complete surprise, since adequate a priori knowledge has been brought in. <p> It is also evident that scale selection significantly improves results. Finally, in Table 3 we compare our approach with the best performing algorithms that discard uncertain estimates. Our approach performs better than the algorithm of Fleet & Jepson, which is the best performing algorithm reported <ref> [7] </ref>.

As soon as one attempts to extend the optic flow definition beyond the intrinsically defined homotopy, one has to come up with a model in order to "solve the aperture problem".

The gauge condition provides a clear entry point for bringing in prior knowledge <ref> [29] </ref>. Thus the gauge condition expresses the semantics, and the gauge-fixed solution could be called the semantical optic flow field, a "meaningful" member of the metamerical class of syntactically equivalent fields. <p> For example, in the context of machine vision none of the assertions that motion is induced by projection of a shaded, sufficiently smooth, rigid surface patch, et cetera <ref> [29, 31, 77, 80] </ref>, is supported by the evidence; at best there is no contradiction. In medical imagery blood flow satisfies physical incompressibility and continuity constraints, whereas bone tissue induces rigid motion, soft tissue deforms nonrigidly, et cetera, but one does not know in advance which applies where.

More specifically we think of optic flow extraction as a measurement process on raw data that cannot be decoupled from the fiducial collection of image processing filters used to probe the data. <p> For example, in the context of machine vision none of the assertions that motion is induced by projection of a shaded, sufficiently smooth, rigid surface patch, et cetera <ref> [29, 31, 77, 80] </ref>, is supported by the evidence; at best there is no contradiction. In medical imagery blood flow satisfies physical incompressibility and continuity constraints, whereas bone tissue induces rigid motion, soft tissue deforms nonrigidly, et cetera, but one does not know in advance which applies where.

Reference-contexts: The gauge invariant subsystem, on the other hand, is fully determined by a data driven feedforward procedure, and is basically a kinematic reformatting of spatiotemporal image data. 2.3 Computational Problems There are many possible approaches to optic flow measurement <ref> [7, 36] </ref>, not all of which have been investigated in-depth. The classical approach based on the OFCE defines the optic flow vector field locally by means of a conservation law; invariant grey-values are attributed to points which are dragged along the flow.

Reference-contexts: If we adopt public consensus as our guideline, then optic flow must be a homotopy rather than a vector field; see Figure 1. The ambiguity of pointwise connections is known as the aperture problem <ref> [28, 59, 81] </ref>. As soon as one attempts to extend the optic flow definition beyond the intrinsically defined homotopy, one has to come up with a model in order to "solve the aperture problem".

Reference-contexts: Section 4 serves as a test and illustration of the theory based on an analytically tractable stimulus. In Section 5 we make a conceptual comparison with similar models proposed in the literature, notably by Otte and Nagel <ref> [68] </ref> and by Werkhoven and Koenderink [83]. We also describe a quantitative study on a benchmark sequence, and compare performance with results from existing techniques as reported by Barron et al. [7]. <p> This naturally fuels the frequently heard argument that "the aperture problem is a false problem", one that can be overcome as soon as "enough structure" is present in the image brightness, e.g. by taking into account "corner points", or the image's "higher order differential structure" <ref> [60, 61, 62, 68, 75, 76, 79, 82, 83] </ref>. That this is a misconception follows immediately from the trivial invariance of image structure under isophote automorphisms, making any tangential flow component conceivable (recall Figure 1). Data evidence does not compel us to make any choice whatsoever. <p> Left: noise free case. Right: 50% noise. 18 (triangles) and first order (stars). Left: noise free case. Right: 50% noise. 5 Comparison with Existing Techniques In Section 5.1 we make a conceptual comparison with models that are most closely related to ours, notably by Otte and Nagel <ref> [68] </ref>, and by Werkhoven and Koenderink [83]. <p> It would lead too far to make a scrutinised comparison here. However, the similarity with a few of these, such as suggested by Otte and Nagel <ref> [68] </ref>, or by Werkhoven and Koenderink [83], is particularly striking. It is therefore instructive to point out how our theory differs from theirs. <p> Among others, Otte and Nagel discuss two OFCE-based linear systems, which they refer to as the "Rigorous Condition" (RC) and the "Integrated Condition" (IC), respectively, and of which they have presented particular orders by way of example. The gauge invariant part of the RC (top four rows of <ref> [68, Equation 8] </ref>) is readily obtained from the first order system above by taking the limit ; t # 0 for the explicit scale factors. This means that such factors as L x + L xtt will effectively converge to L x , et cetera. <p> The rest of the RC (all other rows of <ref> [68, Equation 8] </ref>) has no counterpart in our theory, as we argued this to be part of a specific kind of gauge fixing. More closely related to our work seems to be Otte and Nagel's IC ([68, Equations 10-11a]). <p> In a way the IC is based on duality, which explains the similarity with our method. However, under the IC the (approximate) Lie derivative is integrated over a spatiotemporal cylinder (the temporal extension of the spatial sphere used in <ref> [68, Equation 9] </ref>), and not computed as a smoothly weighted integral. From a duality perspective, the IC-filter is an indicator function on a cylinder of spatial radius and temporal extent proportional to and t , respectively, which prohibits transposition of derivatives.

Reference-contexts: It is a complete family, and thus does not limit potential image analysis. The topological dual G 0 (IR n ) is nothing but the well-known scale-space representation [35, 84], more precisely, its stratification into local jets of successive orders <ref> [23, 27, 43, 48, 49, 69] </ref>. It has a straightforward implementation up to some order and within physical scale limits (grain and scope).

Reference-contexts: Otherwise, if the raw image is a density, we must interpret the filter as a scalar with regard to Lie derivation. This is the plain consequence of duality. For example, in the "generalised motion constraint equation" Schunck considers the flow of a "naked density" field <ref> [71] </ref>. This result does not account for the essential role of duality. Transposed to filter space we obtain a scalar transformation of the filters (the second case in Proposition 1).

Reference-contexts: Thus instead of representing raw images as functions we may consider them as mappings of localised filters into the real numbers ("local samples"). For general image processing purposes one could take smooth filters of rapid decay, S (IR n ) (Schwartz space) <ref> [9, 17, 18, 21, 72] </ref>. "Rapid decay" is a condition to enforce filter confinement. Smoothness and rapid decay are strong topological requirements, yet insignificant constraints from a pragmatic point of view.

Reference-contexts: This naturally fuels the frequently heard argument that "the aperture problem is a false problem", one that can be overcome as soon as "enough structure" is present in the image brightness, e.g. by taking into account "corner points", or the image's "higher order differential structure" <ref> [60, 61, 62, 68, 75, 76, 79, 82, 83] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: If we adopt public consensus as our guideline, then optic flow must be a homotopy rather than a vector field; see Figure 1. The ambiguity of pointwise connections is known as the aperture problem <ref> [28, 59, 81] </ref>. As soon as one attempts to extend the optic flow definition beyond the intrinsically defined homotopy, one has to come up with a model in order to "solve the aperture problem".

Reference-contexts: Section 4 serves as a test and illustration of the theory based on an analytically tractable stimulus. In Section 5 we make a conceptual comparison with similar models proposed in the literature, notably by Otte and Nagel [68] and by Werkhoven and Koenderink <ref> [83] </ref>. We also describe a quantitative study on a benchmark sequence, and compare performance with results from existing techniques as reported by Barron et al. [7]. <p> This naturally fuels the frequently heard argument that "the aperture problem is a false problem", one that can be overcome as soon as "enough structure" is present in the image brightness, e.g. by taking into account "corner points", or the image's "higher order differential structure" <ref> [60, 61, 62, 68, 75, 76, 79, 82, 83] </ref>.

Right: 50% noise. 5 Comparison with Existing Techniques In Section 5.1 we make a conceptual comparison with models that are most closely related to ours, notably by Otte and Nagel [68], and by Werkhoven and Koenderink <ref> [83] </ref>. <p> It would lead too far to make a scrutinised comparison here. However, the similarity with a few of these, such as suggested by Otte and Nagel [68], or by Werkhoven and Koenderink <ref> [83] </ref>, is particularly striking. It is therefore instructive to point out how our theory differs from theirs. <p> In the context of visual motion detection Werkhoven and Koenderink do use the same duality principle as we do, based on the output of receptive fields from the Gaussian family <ref> [83] </ref>. In their article it is conjectured that "The aperture problem [. . . ] is not an inherent problem in visual motion detection." This is evidently true, since visual routines may well be gauge constrained.

Reference-contexts: This is the subject of Section 3. An implication of duality is that our optic flow field is not of a "speedometer" type (one velocity per base point), but is defined by virtue of a set of fiducial "point operators". In particular we consider the familiar Gaussian scale-space paradigm <ref> [35, 39, 84] </ref>, and show in which precise sense the problem of "deep structure" naturally carries over to optic flow. <p> It is a complete family, and thus does not limit potential image analysis. The topological dual G 0 (IR n ) is nothing but the well-known scale-space representation <ref> [35, 84] </ref>, more precisely, its stratification into local jets of successive orders [23, 27, 43, 48, 49, 69]. It has a straightforward implementation up to some order and within physical scale limits (grain and scope).
