Reference-contexts: Proxies thus provide a platform for interworking different security models, administrative models, and domain specific policies. A proxy can also play the role of an "intelligent" intermediate manager. The concept of an intermediate manager exists in network management literature <ref> [CMRW93] </ref>. However, an intermediate manager as it exists only allows delegation of routine management tasks without providing any enhancement to the existing services supported by the management framework. A proxy can play the role of an intermediate manager while implementing additional services which effectively improve the underlying management framework.

Reference-contexts: The SSL provides the necessary operators and constructs to define new events. The need for an event model in network management environments is well established. The polling model is not powerful enough to capture transient faults and behavior. Several research efforts <ref> [Hol89, Has95] </ref> address event specification models that involve temporal operators and the issues associated with them. This research adapts such work to suit the spreadsheet paradigm and fit into a standard network management framework (i.e., SNMP framework).

Reference-contexts: A proxy can play the role of an intermediate manager while implementing additional services which effectively improve the underlying management framework. A spreadsheet paradigm has been introduced in <ref> [SK94] </ref>. This paradigm incorporates value added functions at the intermediate manager and allows user configurability of management information and control.
