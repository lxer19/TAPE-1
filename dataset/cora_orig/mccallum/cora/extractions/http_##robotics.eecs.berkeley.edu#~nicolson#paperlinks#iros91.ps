Reference-contexts: If the configuration has changed the simulation has probably proceeded through the intersection of the nut and bolt. Thus the trajectory is followed backwards to find the point of time during the last update at which the configuration changed. This method is similar to <ref> [Baraff 90] </ref>. Figure 6 gives a flow outline of this routine. 4.2 Integrating the State Updating the state is based on integrating the equations of motion over a designated time period assuming that the contact configuration does not change over this period.

Unfortunately we do not have an implicit description for the bolt. In [Ponce 87] a box based method is presented which is computationally intensive, but accurate for the intersections of straight generalized cylinders such as the nut and bolt.

Reference-contexts: A fraction of the impulse, given by the coefficient of restitution <ref> [Lankarani 90] </ref>, is added to the impulse that cancels the velocities so that the collision is modeled as being partially elastic. <p> The ball bearing would bounce more, in fact, as a typical coefficient of restitution would be 0.8 <ref> [Lankarani 90] </ref> and there would be no damping. The undamped behavior of x and is clear in Figure 9 which shows a time-magnified portion of the trajectory. In particular x z shows how the bolt impacts the nut during vertical upward motion.

Reference-contexts: This is also due to the fact that the initial orientation error was small, only 1 degree, and the allowance ratio was large, 5%, so the parts could be mated with a final error of 1 degree. This "slop angle" is discussed further in <ref> [Nicolson 90] </ref>. We should also explain the chattering behavior shown in to be 0.5, and the damping ratio, chosen to be 0.1.
