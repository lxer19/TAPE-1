Abstract: Concept To Speech (CTS) systems are closely related to two other types of systems: Natural Language Generation (NLG) and Speech Synthesis (SS). In this paper, we propose a new architecture for a CTS system. A Speech Integrating Markup Language (SIML) is designed as an general interface for integrating NLG and SS. We also present a CTS system for a multimedia presentation generation application. We discuss how to extend the current CTS system based on the new architecture. Currently, only limited semantic, syntactic and prosodic features are covered in our proto type system.

Reference-contexts: The above factors are weighted, using a learning algorithm we trained automatically on a small corpus (40 sentences). The result is encouraging. When we test this on the set provided in <ref> (Bachenko and Fitzpatrick, 1990) </ref>, we got a 90% accuracy for primary phrase boundary and we get an 82% accuracy for the utterances in (Gee and Grosjean, 1983). We did not formally measure the algorithm for secondary phrase boundaries, because we only consider inserting pauses at primary phrase boundary.

Reference-contexts: In (Prevost, 1995) and (Steed-man, 1996), theme, rheme and contrast are used as important knowledge sources in determining accentual patterns. In (Davis and Hirschberg, 1988), given/new and topic structure are used to control intonational variation. Other CTS related research includes (Young and Fallside, 1979) and <ref> (Danlos et al., 1986) </ref>. Most of the CTS systems developed to date have a closely integrated architecture. Because of this, CTS algorithms which map information from NLG to TTS parameters are system dependent. There is some related research in developing markup languages for TTS and speech transcription.

Reference-contexts: Currently, there are three components in the CTS system: an NLG component, a set of CTS algorithms and a TTS. The NLG tools and TTS are application independent. We use the FUF/SURGE package <ref> (Elhadad, 1993) </ref> for generation. The speech synthesis system is AT&T Bell Labs' TTS system. The concept to speech algorithms, however, are not system independent. The input of these algorithms are in FUF/SURGE representation and the output is designed specificly for AT&T TTS input.

TTS in MAGIC Basically, we treat TTS as a black box in MAGIC.

Reference-contexts: We show how this architecture can be used in a multimedia presentation application where a prototype SIML was designed for this purpose. 2 Related Work Recently, people have become more interested in developing CTS algorithms to improve the quality of synthesized speech.

Reference-contexts: a specific NLG module and an SS module, often developed for the application, where discourse, semantic and syntactic information produced by the NLG module can be used directly by CTS algorithms to determine either system specific parameters for a Text-To-Speech system, or phonological parameters for a vocal tract model (e.g., <ref> (Young and Fallside, 1979) </ref>). One advantage of this design is its efficiency, but features from the two systems are usually so intertwined that the interface of the CTS algorithms are system dependent. <p> In (Prevost, 1995) and (Steed-man, 1996), theme, rheme and contrast are used as important knowledge sources in determining accentual patterns.

Because of this, CTS algorithms which map information from NLG to TTS parameters are system dependent.
