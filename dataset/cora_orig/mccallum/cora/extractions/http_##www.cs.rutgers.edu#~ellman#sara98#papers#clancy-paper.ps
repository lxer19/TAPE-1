Abstract: In this paper, we present abstraction and problem decomposition techniques that have been used to solve many of the complexity problems encountered when performing a qualitative simulation. Abstraction is used to eliminate irrelevant distinctions within unconstrained regions of the solution space while problem decomposition is used to eliminate combinatoric branching due to the complete temporal ordering of unrelated distinctions that occur within the simulation. These techniques result in an order-of-magnitude improvement in the simulation time required for certain problems thus enabling the application of qualitative simulation techniques to larger, more realistic problems.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the variable is not able to move freely as it does when chatter occurs. Chatter occurs due to the abstract representation used when performing a qualitative simulation and can be eliminated in many cases by ignoring the direction of change for the chattering variables throughout the simulation <ref> (Fouche & Kuipers 1990) </ref>. At times, however, information about the derivative of a variable is required within certain regions of the state space and unconstrained within others. <p> In all cases, dynamic chatter abstraction performed significantly better. Table 2 reports the results for a number of these models. To evaluate the asymptotic behavior, both algorithms along with the ignore-qdirs chatter elimination technique <ref> (Fouche & Kuipers 1990) </ref> were compared on the simple multi-tank cascade example used to evaluate DecSIM. In this model, the netf low variables for each tank exhibit chatter. The results from these tests are listed in table 3.

Reference-contexts: This factor results in combinatoric branching within the behavioral description thus restricting the simulation of larger, more realistic models. The problem encountered can be demonstrated using a simple model of a sequence of cascaded tanks. For a two tank cascade, the QSIM qualitative simulation algorithm <ref> (Kuipers 1994) </ref> generates a total of two behaviors providing a concise description of the system behavior (see figure 1).
