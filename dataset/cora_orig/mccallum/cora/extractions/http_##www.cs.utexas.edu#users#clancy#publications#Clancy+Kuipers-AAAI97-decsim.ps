Reference-contexts: The DecSIM algorithm complements recent research that eliminates another well-known source of irrelevant distinctions within a qualitative simulation chatter branching <ref> (Clancy and Kuipers, 1997) </ref>. Chatter occurs when a variable's direction of change is constrained only by continuity within a region of the state space. Chatter results in intractable branching and a potentially infinite simulation.

Reference-contexts: Automating this process, however, will simplify the model building process and be beneficial when used in conjunction with automated model building systems (Rickel and Porter 1997). The problem of partitioning a graph into closely related components has already been extensively studied within fields such as graph theory <ref> (Even, 1979) </ref> and constraint satisfaction (Tsang, 1993). Developing a partitioning algorithm for DecSIM primarily requires a characterization of the task so that existing research within these fields can be applied. Related Work Williams (1986) developed a history-based qualitative simulation algorithm called the Temporal Constraint Propagator (TCP).

Reference-contexts: The new models are being developed from compartmental models within the fields of biology, medicine and ecology <ref> (Jacquez, 1985) </ref>. Research is also still required to identify the characteristics of an optimal partitioning and to develop an algorithm to automate model decomposition. Currently, DecSIM requires the modeler to identify a partitioning of the variables.

Reference-contexts: Given an appropriate partitioning of the variables, the complexity of the DecSIM algorithm becomes a function of the problem specification rather than an artifact of the simulation algorithm. Qualitative Simulation and DecSIM DecSIM uses the QSIM qualitative simulation algorithm <ref> (Kuipers, 1994) </ref> as its core inference mechanism when simulating an individual component. QSIM uses a qualitative differential equation (QDE) to specify constraints modeling the structural relationships between the variables within a dynamical system. The behavior of the system is described using a tree of alternating time-point and time-interval states.

Reference-contexts: Currently, DecSIM requires the modeler to identify a partitioning of the variables. Providing such a partitioning can simply be viewed as part of the model building task.

The problem of partitioning a graph into closely related components has already been extensively studied within fields such as graph theory (Even, 1979) and constraint satisfaction (Tsang, 1993).
