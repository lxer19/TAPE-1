Reference-contexts: This coordination would be challenging if there are many (millions of) stations. If the propagation matrix is not completely filled-in (because some stations can neither interfere with reception at, nor communicate directly with, some other stations) then the coordination problem 1 e.g. see [KS87] and [TK84] 3 e.g. see <ref> [BG87] </ref> Chapter 4 19 may become even more complicated. 4 In either case, if the successful transfer of a packet requires that millions of stations refrain from interfering with its reception, then a single failure (to refrain from interfering) might disable the whole system. <p> In practice other considerations may be in play, such as delay performance and contention for transmitter time at intermediate stations. With more complicated metrics of performance, minimum-energy routing might not be optimal. However in 11 For example, the Distributed Asynchronous Bellman-Ford Algorithm is described in <ref> [BG87] </ref>. 12 In practice, stations might be manufactured to use a fixed amount of processing gain, in which case the throughput would not incrementally depend on the signal-to-noise ratio. <p> First, a method of avoiding interference from just the receiving station's own transmitter will be presented, and then the method will be extended to avoid interference from all of the nearby stations that matter. 1 See the Packet Radio Networks section in Chapter 4 of <ref> [BG87] </ref>. 31 3.1 The scheduling method When a packet is to be sent to another station, it must be sent at a time when its reception will not be prevented by the level of interference.

Reference-contexts: The power per unit area falls off as the inverse square of the distance from the source. The voltage measured on the feedline is proportional to the square root of the power on the feedline. See <ref> [RR64] </ref> Chapter 4. 12 Actual propagation in most cases will either be nearly equal to the free space propagation (when the antennas are within radio line of sight) or will be attenuated (when there are obstructions). <p> The distance at which this attenuation occurs is sometimes called the radio horizon and is often modeled as if it behaved like a visual horizon of an earth with the radius increased to 4 3 of the actual earth's radius. For more see <ref> [RR64] </ref> Chapter 4. 21 ignored. The average density is then M R 2 . As the number of stations M increases, so does the density. The distance to nearest neighbors also decreases, remaining proportional to the distance R 0 = 1 2 .

Reference-contexts: The successful detection of wide-band spread-spectrum signals (which this work will use) is particularly robust to interference from multi-path propagation. If necessary, a rake receiver can be employed to detect and combine the separately arriving copies of a transmitted signal. Rake receivers are described in <ref> [SOSL94] </ref>. 6 The power of a signal captured by an antenna is proportional to the power per unit area of the incident electro-magnetic radiation. The power per unit area falls off as the inverse square of the distance from the source. <p> DSSS radio systems operate by using a 9 See any of [Dix84], <ref> [SOSL94] </ref>, [ZP85], [Nic88], [CEMS83] for a more thorough introduction to spread-spectrum radio techniques. 10 This advantage is mentioned by Gallager in the introduction of [Gal85]. 14 more traditional narrow band modulator and demodulator, but before the modulated signal is transmitted, a fast-running pseudo-random bit sequence is combined with the signal. <p> Some additional signal level, or headroom (the constant factor ff in the formula above), will be needed over the minimum implied by the Shannon bound.
