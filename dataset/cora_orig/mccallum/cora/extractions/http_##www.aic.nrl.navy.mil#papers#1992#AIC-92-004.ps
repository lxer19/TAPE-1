Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are likely to require sophisticated software controllers to maintain vehicle performance in the presence of vehicle faults. The test and evaluation of complex software controllers is expected to be a challenging task. The goal of this e ffort is to apply machine learning techniques from the field of arti ficial intelligence to the general problem of evaluating an intelligent controller for an autonomous vehicle. The approach involves subjecting a controller to an adaptively chosen set of fault scenarios within a vehicle simulator, and searching for combinations of faults that produce noteworthy performance by the vehicle controller. The search employs a genetic algorithm. We illustrate the approach by evaluating the performance of a subsumption-based controller for an autonomous vehicle. The preliminary evidence suggests that this approach is an e ffective alternative to manual testing of sophisticated software controllers.

Reference-contexts: Testing all possible situations is obviously intractable due to the complexity of the system involved. Analysis tech - niques exist for testing the robustness of low-level controll - ers in isolation <ref> [1] </ref>, but the methods are not applicable to testing the vehicle as a whole. Traditional approaches to performance testing of controllers can be labor intensive and time consuming.

Reference-contexts: The vehicle simulation is called AUTOACE. The simulation includes the ability to control environmental conditions, in particular, constant wind and wind gusts. The autonomous controller, which is responsible for flying the aircraft and performing the landing on the carrier deck, was designed using a subsumption architecture approach <ref> [2] </ref>. The controller is composed of individual behaviors, operating at different levels of abstraction, that communicate among themselves and together allow the aircraft to fly and to land. Top level behaviors include fly-craft and land-craft. At a lower level, behaviors include fly-heading and fly-altitude.

Reference-contexts: Along another front, we are looking at changes to the GA to improve its search for fault scenarios. One area that we are currently examining is the use of sharing functions to help maintain diversity in the population <ref> [13] </ref>. These techniques force the GA to cover some number of the better solutions with a percentage of the population instead of converging to a single maximum, in essence making the population share the payoff. This is important in situations where the simulation time becomes excessively long.
