Reference-contexts: When multiple messages are in the network, it is possible that a multicast message can reserve a consumption channel in one node and wait for a consumption channel in another node <ref> [BCR94] </ref>. Thus, a circular wait among multicast messages for consumption channels can lead to a deadlock. Each node have two consumption channels for deadlock-freedom- the UMC-channel (Upward bound Message Consumption channel) and the DMC-channel (Downward bound Message Consumption channel).

Reference-contexts: Note that this shared channel is not necessarily within the cycle. Obviously, a False Resource Cycle cannot occur, since this is physically impossible. (Even though the configuration is legal, it is not a reachable configuration <ref> [CG94] </ref>.) Therefore, a False Resource Cycle cannot be used to create a deadlock configuration.

Reference-contexts: We illustrate the applicability of these conditions by developing two adaptive multicast routing algorithms for 2-D mesh architectures. 2 Previous Work Dally and Seitz have shown that for nonadaptive routing algorithms, the existence of an acyclic channel dependency graph is necessary and sufficient for deadlock freedom <ref> [DS87] </ref>. Much of the early research work on wormhole routing has focussed on the design of deadlock-free routing algorithms using this result.

Reference-contexts: output channels is provided, a selection function is then used to select which of these output channels a message uses. 1 Duato showed that requiring an acyclic channel dependency graph is too restrictive for routing algorithms defined by relations of the form R : N fi N ! P (C) <ref> [Dua91, Dua93] </ref>. Cycles are permitted in the channel dependency graph if some subset of channels defines a connected routing subfunction with an acyclic extended channel dependency graph. He also designed adaptive routing algorithms based on the relaxed condition.

Reference-contexts: It is possible to design multicast routing algorithms with more adaptivity by relaxing the conditions used in previous approaches. Recently, Duato has provided a sufficiency condition for deadlock freedom for networks which support path-based routing <ref> [Dua95] </ref>. As a result, he has been able to design the most adaptive multicast routing algorithms to date. His theory, based on an extension of the channel dependency graph, introduces additional direct and indirect multicast dependencies. <p> The routing algorithm has the same degree of adaptivity as the one described by Duato <ref> [Dua95] </ref>, since both algorithms provide the same set of routing paths. Our algorithms requires fewer resources, however- 5 virtual channels per node as opposed to 6 that is required by Duato's algorithm. it requires fewer virtual channels to provide the same adaptivity.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Collective communication routines such as broadcast, scatter, gather, reductions, transpose, prefix computations (scan), etc. are very important for developing parallel programs that are both efficient and portable. Although there is a large body of research that has addressed the development of efficient collective communication algorithms (Kumar et al. <ref> [KGGK94] </ref> contains a good survey; a more recent survey dealing with wormhole-routed architectures appears in [MTR95]), this research has invariably assumed a simple underlying hardware model with nonadaptive (dimension-ordered) routing of point-to-point messages.

Reference-contexts: Improvement in the performance of collective operations could arise by enhancing the unicast router model. Ni has argued that hardware support for multi-cast is critical for efficient performance [Ni95]. While several router models of multicasting are possible, the path-based model <ref> [LN91, LMN94] </ref> seems the most feasible. In the path-based model, a single-head worm visits the destinations in sequence. The router hardware then has to have the capability to copy and forward a message (as opposed to just forwarding with unicast messages). <p> Hence the condition for deadlock freedom with path-based routing is different from unicast routing because of additional dependencies introduced into the channel dependency graph. Typical deadlock-free routing algorithms in such a model are based on the use of Hamiltonian paths and disjoint destination sets <ref> [LN91, LMN94] </ref> or based on using only the paths of the underlying unicast routing algorithm [PSP94]. It is possible to design multicast routing algorithms with more adaptivity by relaxing the conditions used in previous approaches.

Hereafter, we denote a node by its associated label. Let N be the set of all the labels associated with the nodes (in the case of a kfik mesh, N = f0; 1; 2; ; k 2 1g).

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we provide a general set of necessary and sufficient conditions for deadlock freedom for a large class of routing algorithms and router models which use wormhole routing (for a survey on wormhole routing, see <ref> [NM93] </ref>). We illustrate the applicability of these conditions by developing two adaptive multicast routing algorithms for 2-D mesh architectures. 2 Previous Work Dally and Seitz have shown that for nonadaptive routing algorithms, the existence of an acyclic channel dependency graph is necessary and sufficient for deadlock freedom [DS87].

Reference-contexts: He also designed adaptive routing algorithms based on the relaxed condition. Schwiebert and Jayasimha have used Du-ato's sufficiency condition and the mesh topological properties to propose optimal fully adaptive routing algorithms for arbitrary dimension mesh networks <ref> [SJ93, SJ95b] </ref>. These algorithms are optimal in the number of virtual channels and in the number of restrictions they place on the use of virtual channels.

Reference-contexts: In such a case, it is shown that the presence of a certain subgraph of the CW G is a necessary and sufficient condition for deadlock freedom. The authors have extended this work to include any flow control mechanism (that is not inherently deadlock-free) <ref> [SJ95a] </ref>. They also comment that the proof technique applies to any routing relation that depends only on local information available at a router to make routing decisions.

Reference-contexts: The solution, which works for routing relations of the form R : C fi N fi N ! P (C), introduces two new notions: the channel waiting graph (CWG) and False Resource Cycles <ref> [SJ96] </ref>. The CW G, which is derived on the basis of waiting instead of channel usage, omits most channel dependencies that cannot lead to a deadlock configuration. Consequently, the proofs of deadlock freedom become natural and straightforward. <p> For any output channel available to m i that is also available to the source, assume the source has injected a message that is occupying this channel. If R A is not suffix-closed (the notions of suffix-closure and prefix-closure are defined in <ref> [SJ96] </ref>, however, it is possible that some of the output channels available to m i can be used only by messages arriving on the input channel used by m i .
