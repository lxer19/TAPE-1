Reference-contexts: For high loads the analytical approximations for throughput are 3 Multiple access systems that employ random access possess multiple equilibrium points (points where the offered load is equal to the throughput) and are therefore potentially unstable; for a comprehensive discussion on the stability of random access techniques refer to <ref> [1] </ref> [13]. 30 31 32 33 smaller than those obtained through simulations. This is due to the fact that at high loads a large fraction of the renewal intervals have only collisions and therefore the average length of a collision is smaller than that used in the analytical results. <p> The figure shows only simulation results since obtaining closed form solutions for throughput of 40 systems with backoff is computationally intractable <ref> [1] </ref>. With backoff, fewer unique frames get transmitted in a time interval as compared to a system without backoff. This is due to the combined effects of retransmission of collided frames and deferment of transmission when the channel is busy.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, by assuming no capture (ff = 1), i.e., all data frames involved in a collision are destroyed, (as is the case in wired LANs), a lower bound can be obtained.

Reference-contexts: This reults in a higher average delay. 4.6 Effect of Variable Frame Size To study the effect of varying data size, we modeled the generated traffic with a bi-modal distribution for the data size. Results obtained in <ref> [6] </ref> indicate that most of the traffic on a lan consists of "short" ( 0:1 fi Max. frame size) data frames. If the traffic is primarily made up of short data frames, the throughput is 43 higher, other parameters being constant.

Reference-contexts: The contention window will remain at CW max for the remaining retries. The set of CW values are 7 (CW min ), 15, 31, 63, 127, 255 (CW max ) <ref> [7] </ref>. In this chapter, we described the asynchronous data transfer methods of the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol. In the next chapter, we analyze the DCF and obtain closed form solutions for throughput and the probability of success for the basic access scheme and the method using RTS/CTS frames.

Reference-contexts: However, in a FHSS system different hopping sequences are employed in neighboring BSS's while all stations in a BSS use identical ones. For further details of the physical layer and on the allocation of spreading (hopping) sequences refer to <ref> [8] </ref> [9]. The 802.11 MAC layer protocol provides asynchronous, time-bounded, and contention free access control on a variety of physical layers. These functions are provided independent of the characteristics of the underlying physical layers and/or data rates.
