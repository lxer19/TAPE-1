Reference-contexts: Spectroscopy parameters: 90 o pulse, TR 10s, spectral width 4803Hz, 16K data points, water presaturation and 64 to 1024 averages depending on initial tumour weight. <ref> [4] </ref> For pattern recognition analysis, spectra were digitised at intervals of 0.010ppm over the range 4.5 to 0.5ppm giving 400 variables.

Reference-contexts: Although neural network computing has been the method of choice for classification using this type of data [2,3], it is usually difficult to make a biochemical interpretation of the classification scheme. The use of Genetic Programming (GP) has been reported as part of a consensus diagnosis approach <ref> [5] </ref> and was particularly interesting as it made different errors in the classification as compared to a neural network. GP has been used in classification of non-medical data [6,7]. The task is to classify tumours from 1 H NMR spectra which give information about biochemical compounds in a tissue.

Reference-contexts: Scores were calculated for each sample from these 20 Varimax vectors and used as inputs for the GP classification. GP used class labels as outputs with two possible classes (meningioma = -1; non-meningioma = +1). The GP program used was in Lisp following Koza <ref> [7] </ref>. The terminal set consisted of the 20 Varimax scores, labelled A-S and U (T being a reserved word in Lisp). The functions used were taken from those shown in Table 1. The selection used method was fitness-proportionate and the generation method ramped half and half.
