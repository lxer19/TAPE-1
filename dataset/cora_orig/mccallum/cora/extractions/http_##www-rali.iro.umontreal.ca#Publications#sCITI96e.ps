Reference-contexts: For the purposes of our tests, the Reacc hypothesis generator used a list of word forms taken from the Dictionnaire micro-informatis du franais (DMF), a morpho-syntactic dictionary that contains nearly 380,000 distinct word forms <ref> [1] </ref>. Such a large number of terms is probably unnecessary. In fact, as fully satisfactory results were obtained during preliminary trials using a dictionary that recognized some 50,000 word forms only.

Reference-contexts: We then went on to an initial training phase, using a 60,000-word manually tagged corpus taken from the Canadian Hansard <ref> [2] </ref>. Lastly, a much larger untagged corpus was used, consisting of over 3 million words, in order to reestimate the models parameters.

Reference-contexts: Note, however, that this idea is not entirely original. El-Bze et al. <ref> [3] </ref> describe an accent-restoration technique that draws upon the same concepts, while Yarowsky has obtained comparable results [6] by combining different criteria for statistical disambiguation within a unifying framework (decision lists). 2 Automatic Accent Restoration We have developed an automatic accent restoration program called Reacc.

Reference-contexts: Once all the hypotheses have been generated, the most probable ones must be selected. This step is called disambiguation. A stochastic language model, called a hidden Markov model (HMM) is used (by means of Fosters Im package <ref> [4] </ref>) to carry out the disambiguation process, According to this model, a text is seen as the result of two distinct stochastic processes. The first generates a series of symbols which, in our model, correspond to morpho-syntactic tags (e.g., CommonNoun-masculinesingular; Verbindicativepresent3rdPersonplural).

Reference-contexts: If T is the set of all possible nlength tagged sequences, then: Although the direct calculation of this equation requires a number of operations exponential in n, there is an algorithm that will produce the same results in polynomial time (see <ref> [5] </ref>). Our disambiguation strategy consists in choosing a series of hypotheses that produce the version of the text with the highest overall probability.

It is based on a stochastic language model. Reacc will accept as input a string of characters that represents unaccented French text.
