Abstract: We study weakenings of associativity which imply that a quasi-group is a loop. In particular, these weakenings include each of Fenyves' "Extra" loop axioms. x1. Introduction. A quasigroup is a system (G; ) such that G is a non-empty set and is a binary function on G satisfying 8xz9!y(xy = z) and 8yz9!x(xy = z). A loop is a quasigroup which has an identity element, 1, satisfying 8x(x1 = 1x = x). See the books [1, 2, 9] for background and references to earlier literature. A group is, by definition, an associative loop. As is well-known, every quasigroup satisfying the associative law has an identity element, and is hence a group. In this paper we consider weakenings of associativity which also imply that a quasigroup is a loop, even though many of these weakenings do not imply the full associative law. As usual, equations written this way with variables are understood to be universally quantified. We showed in [6] that every quasigroup satisfying any of these is a loop; hence, by much earlier results of Bol and Bruck (see [1], p. 115), these four identities are equivalent in quasigroups, even though the quasigroups satisfying these identities (the Moufang loops) are not necessarily groups. Definition. A weak associative law is an equation of the form ff = fi, where for some variables, V 1 ; V 2 ; : : : ; V n , (not necessarily distinct), ff and fi are both associations of the product V 1 V 2 V n . We call n the size of the equation. The law is non-trivial iff ff is not the same as fi. For example, the Moufang identities are weak associative laws of size four. All weak associative laws of size one and two are trivial. For size three, besides the trivial laws and the full associative law, there are three laws written with two distinct variables the flexible law and the right and left alternative laws:

Reference-contexts: Under the heading "Loop?", we have listed "yes" or "no" depending on whether or not it implies that a quasigroup is a loop. These 24 are all among the "60 identities of the Bol - Moufang type" considered by Fenyves <ref> [4] </ref>. Our list is a proper subset of his, since we are discarding some laws which we have already seen do not imply a quasigroup is a loop, and we are discarding some mirrors.

Reference-contexts: Lemmas about j and/or k turn out to be convenient preliminary steps in proving that a quasigroup is a loop. Examples of this technique are the next lemma and two of the proofs in x3. Another example is the proof in <ref> [6] </ref> that N 1 or N 2 imply that a quasigroup is a loop (the proofs from M 1 or M 2 are trivial exercises). 2.7. Lemma. Every quasigroup satisfying either of the mirrors ((xy)x)y = (xy)(xy) or (yx)(yx) = y (x (yx)) is a loop. Proof. <p> x (x (yz)) no I (3; 1; 5) 48; LCb (x (xy))z = x ((xy)z) yes ASSOC 47 ((xy)x)z = (xy)(xz) yes ASSOC 11 (x (yx))z = (xy)(xz) yes 3:1 12 (x (yx))z = x ((yx)z) yes ASSOC 18 ((xy)z)x = (xy)(zx) yes ASSOC 1 (x (yz))x = (xy)(zx) yes <ref> [6] </ref> 2; M 1 (x (yz))x = x ((yz)x) no F LEX 9 ((xy)y)z = (xy)(yz) yes ASSOC 31 (x (yy))z = (xy)(yz) yes 3:2 32 (x (yy))z = x ((yy)z) yes 3:1 38 ((xy)z)y = (xy)(zy) yes ASSOC 21 (x (yz))y = (xy)(zy) yes 3:3 22; E1 (x (yz))y = <p> The rest of the "yes" answers seem to require some proof, and we have listed, as a reference for the proof, either the paper <ref> [6] </ref> or a theorem number in this paper, Fenyves points out that besides the equations we have flagged by ASSOC, it is easy to see that each of the equations 12, 32, and 52 is equivalent to full associativity in loops.

Reference-contexts: Proof. Use I (1; 2; 3) and I (2; 1; 3), respectively. Note that these two equations can be weakened to the left and right Bol identities by setting w = y, and Robinson <ref> [10] </ref> already showed that neither of the Bol identities implies 3 that a quasigroup is a loop. It is not hard to see that every other non-trivial four variable law of size four implies that a quasigroup is a loop, and hence a group by Lemma 2.4.
