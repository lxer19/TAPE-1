Abstract: The Argonne Computing and Communications Infrastructure Futures Laboratory (Futures Lab) was created in 1994 to explore, develop, and prototype next-generation computing and communications infrastructure systems. An important goal of the Futures Lab project is to understand how to incorporate advanced display and media server systems into scientific computing environments. The objective is to create new collaborative environment technologies that combine advanced networking, virtual space technology, and high-end virtual environments to enable the construction of virtual teams for scientific research. We believe that digital media, immersive displays, and networked collaborative spaces are critical elements of future computing environments and will be in common use by the end of the decade. We hope that our efforts will provide new capabilities to scientific computing systems and will accelerate development of virtual organizations to conduct experimental, computational, and theoretical science. Our efforts are largely focused on technology development and integration with selected applications projects used to demonstrate the new technology. We are interested in driving large-scale supercomputer systems architecture to

Reference-contexts: contaminant levels in a valley in southern Germany. 2.1 CAVE The CAVE is a virtual reality environment originally developed at the Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago and now an active research project at EVL, Argonne National Laboratory, and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications <ref> [1] </ref>. In its current implementation, the CAVE uses three projectors, displaying computer images on two walls and the floor of a ten-foot cube. Images are rear projected onto translucent screens. A three-dimensional image is achieved by displaying slightly different views of the scene for the right and left eye.

This includes the development of a CAVE-to-CAVE library. The library encapsulates CAVE-to-CAVE methods, mechanisms, and concepts. Considerable effort is being spent developing models to support effective CAVE-to-CAVE communication.

Reference-contexts: The initial goal of Voyager is to develop the next-generation hypermedia server architecture that will enable the construction and rapid deployment of tools for building virtual organizations <ref> [4] </ref>. Ultimately, Voyager is intended to replace the types of servers currently used for supporting collaborative environments (e.g., ftp servers, web servers, document servers). In addition, Voyager will provide an extensible environment for making audio, video, and other stream-oriented recordings available to others on the network.

Reference-contexts: The principal resource this laboratory provides is access to a 12-node IBM SP2 parallel computer that has been configured with audio and video hardware and a large amount of disk space to enable the prototyping of parallel multimedia servers <ref> [5] </ref>. The laboratory also contains three PowerPC workstations with audio and video support.

Reference-contexts: As more CAVE applications are using high-performance computing backends, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the details of network and systems performance on the interactive effectiveness of the CAVE. Distributed CAVE applications are being instrumented, and the performance data will be analyzed to improve interactive responsiveness <ref> [6] </ref>. An important project is the development of a generic CAVE library that supports additional hardware platforms beyond that of Silicon Graphics. The first effort will be a Freedom 6000-based CAVE library.
