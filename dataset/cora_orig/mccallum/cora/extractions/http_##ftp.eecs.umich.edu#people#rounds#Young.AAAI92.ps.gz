Title: Nonmonotonic Sorts for Feature Structures  
Author: Mark A. Young 
Address: 1101 Beal Ave. Ann Arbor, MI 48109

Abstract: There have been many recent attempts to incorporate defaults into unification-based grammar formalisms. What these attempts have in common is that they all lose one of the most desirable properties of feature systems: namely, presentation order independence. This paper describes a method of dealing with defaults that retains order independence. The method works by making a strong distinction between strict and default information. The addition of nonmonotonic sorts allows default information to be carried in the feature structure while retaining a simple, deterministic unification operation. Monotonic feature structures are red-erived through a satisfaction relation that is abstract in that it depends only on the ordering information for sorts.

Reference-contexts: Introduction There have been many recent attempts to incorporate defaults into unification-based grammar formalisms. (Shieber 1987) suggests add conservatively and (1986) overwrite as default mechanisms for PATR-II. (Kaplan 1987) describes priority union for LFG. <ref> (Bouma 1990) </ref> describes a default unification operation for a generic UG. (Carpenter 1991) compares skeptical and credulous methods for default unification, and describes a method of default inheritance. None of these schemes retain the property of presentation order independence.

Reference-contexts: The most natural system of priorities would mirror the structure of the lexicon. This extension allows for defaults appearing at lower levels of the lexicon to overrule those appearing at more general levels. We are also investigating the effect of typing information <ref> (Carpenter 1992) </ref> on nonmonotonic sorts. Such information allows a limited form of inference to be carried out within a FS. As with default equations, this leads to non-local effects in the FS.

Reference-contexts: We said earlier that we could not be sure what sort a NS would turn out to be. We can, however, give the range of possible values. First we define a weaker notion of explanation. This notion is borrowed from Theorist <ref> (Poole et al. 1986) </ref>. In that default reasoning system, a belief can be explained by showing that it follows from what is known together with a consistent set of hypotheses. In our case, what is known is the strict information, and the possible hypotheses are the default sorts.

Reference-contexts: The structure hS; OEi is called the sort hierarchy. The main operation carried out on feature structures is unification. We write F uG for the most general unifier of F and G. Since we are working with sorted feature structures, we will require a method of sorted unification <ref> (Walther 1988) </ref>. Note that the restriction on the sort hierarchy will ensure that most general unifiers are unique if they exist at all. Defaults and the Lexicon Defaults most commonly appear in the lexicon of natural language systems.
