Reference-contexts: Replication of both control and data can be employed to provide systems capable of tolerating partial failures. To use replication techniques most effectively, it is important to understand the nature of the failures to be masked. Recent studies include analyses of Tandem systems <ref> [1, 2] </ref> and the IBM/XA system [3]. Research covering heterogeneous systems is less common. Very few such studies have appeared in the open literature, although it is certain that most companies perform reliability studies of their products internally.

Reference-contexts: These monitors are called tattlers since they periodically inquire about other hosts and then tattle to each other about what they learn. The distributed data base is managed using an epidemic replication protocol <ref> [5, 6, 7] </ref>. Such protocols provide weak consistency guarantees, which are sufficient for statistical purposes. <p> This provides a highly available service, and communication can occur at off-peak times; it also handles failures well. On the other hand, the application must be able to tolerate temporarily inconsistent information. The time-stamped anti-entropy method is the heart of these protocols. As in the Grapevine anti-entropy protocol <ref> [5] </ref>, messages are exchanged by two processes. The exchange of information continues until they are mutually consistent. As long as processes in a group continue to perform these exchanges, changes will eventually propagate to all replicas. Unlike the Grapevine protocol, this method maintains lists of time-stamps at each process.

Reference-contexts: These logs can take any form, but are initially sequences of tuples of the form hhost, boot time, sample timei. The tattler daemon communicates this information to other tattlers, using weak-consistency group communication protocols. These protocols ensure that the logs and host list are eventually consistent <ref> [8] </ref> (see x3 for details). To accomplish this, each tattler daemon periodically contacts another tattler and the two exchange their log and host files in anti-entropy sessions. Both then merge the information to obtain a log with better coverage of the monitored hosts.

Reference-contexts: Both then merge the information to obtain a log with better coverage of the monitored hosts. The group communication protocols require the tattlers to know the identity of the other tattlers. This is done using a weak-consistency membership protocol <ref> [9] </ref>. This protocol requires that a new tattler join the group of tattlers by obtaining one or more sponsors. A tattler can leave the group by following a two-phase protocol: it first declares its intent to leave.

Reference-contexts: The ability to indentify missing information increases the efficiency and allows applications to build stronger forms of consistency. Our group has also developed a new light-weight group membership mechanism that allows temporary inconsistencies in membership views <ref> [10] </ref>. Each group member maintains a view of the group, listing those processes it believes to be members. The members use weak-consistency communication protocols to ensure that all group members eventually converge to a consistent view of the membership, as discussed in the last section.
