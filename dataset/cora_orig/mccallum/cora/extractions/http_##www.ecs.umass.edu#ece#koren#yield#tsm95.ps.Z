Abstract: Several yield enhancement techniques are proposed for the last two stages of VLSI design, i.e., topological/symbolic and physical layout synthesis. Our approach is based on modifications of the symbolic/physical layout to reduce the sensitivity of the design to random point defects without increasing the area, rather than fault tolerance techniques. A layout compaction algorithm is presented and the yield improvement results of some industrial layout examples are shown. This algorithm has been implemented in a commercial CAD framework. Some routing techniques for wire length and via minimization are presented and the results of wire length reduction in benchmark routing examples are shown. We demonstrate through topological optimization for PLA-based designs that yield enhancement can be applied even at a higher level of design abstraction. Experimental results show that it is possible to achieve significant yield improvements without increasing the layout area by applying the proposed techniques during layout synthesis.

Reference-contexts: Only recently have researchers started reporting their work in the area of layout synthesis for yield enhancement. The first significant work in the area of layout modifications for yield improvement has been reported by Allan <ref> [1] </ref>. A set of local rules have been proposed for contacts, metal and polysilicon layers for yield enhancement. However, these techniques are not general enough to be applied in the regular physical layout synthesis stages such as routing and compaction.

So far this additional freedom has been utilized very effectively to optimize the performance by way of wire length minimization <ref> [3] </ref>. A new compaction algorithm is presented in this section to improve the yield without increasing the layout area. <p> It is interesting to see the significant differences in the final layout under these two different manufacturing conditions. 2.5 Results 12 The yield enhancement algorithms proposed in this section have been implemented as an additional feature in IBM compactor <ref> [3] </ref>. Two large circuits were analyzed for yield improvements that can be achieved using these techniques. The layouts are scaled down to 0.5 micron technology. These designs consist of several thousands of active devices and two metal layers are used as interconnect layers.

The minimum achievable size of the layout is determined by the longest path (critical path) of the constraint graph. <p> When relocating the wire segments, the compactor may stretch them in order to maintain the original topology, resulting in longer nets and layers with a large critical area for open-circuit faults. In the SPARCS compactor <ref> [4] </ref> non-critical elements can be placed either on the top or bottom (left or right) optionally. If we take the defect size distribution and the additional wires introduced in relocating the elements also into consideration, much better 7 results from the yield point of view can be obtained.

Reference-contexts: Since the minimum width and spacing requirements for vias are larger than the wire segments, generally more compact designs are possible with fewer vias <ref> [5, 13] </ref>. Sometimes, just to avoid a via, routers may introduce very long wire segments, which certainly results in layers with higher critical areas [17]. On the contrary, in certain situations it may be worthwhile to introduce some vias (or leave some vias intact) to avoid unnecessary additional wiring.

Reference-contexts: The reduction in wire length of the individual layers may result in better compaction thereby reducing the overall area. In this example, the area is reduced by 12.5%. Therefore, the effective yield of the die also increases by approximately that percentage <ref> [6] </ref>. However, this much area reduction may not always be possible when performing yield optimization, if better folding tools are used [18]. In such a case, the percentage reduction in wire length and in the attendant critical area may be less. <p> Therefore, the overall reduction in the critical area is about 24% in the polysilicon layer and about 11% in metal-1 and diffusion layers. In larger chips, these reductions in the critical areas and the chip area result in about 15% improvement in the yield <ref> [6] </ref>. Results of wire length minimization on benchmark examples are shown in Table 4. The average wire length reduction is 15.4% for the non-folded PLAs and 10.9% for the column-folded case. This wire length reduction can significantly improve the defect sensistivity of the corresponding layers of the circuits.

Reference-contexts: Significant yield enhancement can also be achieved by minimizing the defect sensitivity of the design that is already optimized for area. We have proposed a topological optimization technique for yield enhancement of PLA based designs in <ref> [7] </ref>. In our approach, the topological representation of the PLA is altered so that the critical area of the generated layout is minimized. This reduction in critical area is achieved primarily by minimizing the wire lengths in one or more layers of the layout. <p> The average wire length reduction is 15.4% for the non-folded PLAs and 10.9% for the column-folded case. This wire length reduction can significantly improve the defect sensistivity of the corresponding layers of the circuits. Yield improvement results due to the topological optimization on larger PLAs have been presented in <ref> [7] </ref>. We illustrated the significance of topological optimization for yield enhancement in PLA-based designs.

Reference-contexts: In many examples, the via reduction results are better than the results reported by several via minimization algorithms [34]. This via reduction will further improve the defect sensitivity of the layouts. Yield improvement results of these examples due to wire length and via reduction have been reported in <ref> [8] </ref>. 4.0 Topological Layout Design Techniques During the last decade, many structured design techniques have been developed to minimize the design cycle time of VLSI systems. PLAs, gate arrays and standard cell designs are some of the popular design styles.

Reference-contexts: With a similar reassignment in net-2 from track-2 to track-7, the net length is reduced by half. The A c of the metal-1 layer is reduced by 25% with these two modifications. Analogous to minimum wire length requirements for introducing additional vias in the preferred layer maximization problem <ref> [9] </ref>, some criteria to remove/add a via in terms of wire length/critical area must be introduced. For example, for the defect densities reported in [10], the fault probability of one metal-1/poly contact is equivalent to that of a poly wire segment of length 15 microns and width 1.5 microns.

Reference-contexts: Several mathematical models have been proposed for very accurate yield predictions. This high degree of accuracy is achieved, to a large extent, by replacing the chip area with critical area (which represents the defect sensitivity of the layout) in the yield models <ref> [14, 19, 20, 27, 33] </ref>. Recently several methods have been proposed for estimating the yield of a chip from its layout detail. Xlaser and other yield analysis CAD tools are based on analytical models [15, 26]. Monte-Carlo-simulation-based yield prediction tools were also 3 developed, e.g., [35]. <p> The probability that a defect will cause a failure, , depends on the size of the defect relative to the dimensions of the layout patterns. Several analytical models were proposed to calculate the critical area from layout details <ref> [14, 27, 33] </ref>. The critical area for defects of size x is defined as the area in which the center of a defect must fall in order to cause a circuit failure. <p> The critical area of the rectangular elements or regions is calculated using the analytical models presented in <ref> [14, 33] </ref>. Then, each non-critical element is searched in the breadth-first order for an optimal location. Elements can be moved only in the upward direction since all the elements are at the minimum possible location to start with. <p> As a result, defect sensitivity of the layouts belong to active regions remains almost unchanged, except for boundaries. Therefore, the results of these layers are omitted. The defect size distribution model by Stapper and Ferris-Prabhu <ref> [33, 14] </ref> is used for yield optization as well as defect sensitivity measurements. We assume the following values for different parameters of the model; x o = 0.5, p = 3.0, and q = 1.0.

Reference-contexts: However, these techniques are not general enough to be applied in the regular physical layout synthesis stages such as routing and compaction. Some routing techniques for yield enhancement have been developed for two layer routing <ref> [22, 30] </ref>. These routing algorithms are based on minimization of defect sensitivity of the layout. In the routers proposed in [30], defect sensitivity of the second layer is not considered while minimizing the defect sensitivity of the first layer. <p> Some routing techniques for yield enhancement have been developed for two layer routing [22, 30]. These routing algorithms are based on minimization of defect sensitivity of the layout. In the routers proposed in <ref> [30] </ref>, defect sensitivity of the second layer is not considered while minimizing the defect sensitivity of the first layer. Moreover, criteria chosen for defect sensitivity was not based on any analytical models reported in the yield literature. These shortcomings were addressed to some extent in [22]. <p> By adding a via, which can eliminate more than 15 microns of polysilicon, critical area/fault probability can be reduced. This additional criterion in routing, for the trade-off between wire length and via, will result in layouts with better yield characteristics. In the routing techniques proposed in <ref> [30] </ref> only the adjacency information of horizontal tracks is considered as a criteria for defect sensitivity. Neither defect size distributions nor analytical models were used to characterize yield.

Reference-contexts: The objective of statistical design centering is to maximize the parametric yield of a circuit with respect to manufacturing process parameters. For the physical layout design stage, the concept of `Design for Yield` has been applied very successfully through global design rules and area minimization <ref> [32] </ref> from the very beginning. These design rules are optimized for minimizing the process yield losses due to global variations. However, in a mature manufacturing line, random point defects are the major source of yield losses.

Reference-contexts: Several mathematical models have been proposed for very accurate yield predictions. This high degree of accuracy is achieved, to a large extent, by replacing the chip area with critical area (which represents the defect sensitivity of the layout) in the yield models <ref> [14, 19, 20, 27, 33] </ref>. Recently several methods have been proposed for estimating the yield of a chip from its layout detail. Xlaser and other yield analysis CAD tools are based on analytical models [15, 26]. Monte-Carlo-simulation-based yield prediction tools were also 3 developed, e.g., [35]. <p> The probability that a defect will cause a failure, , depends on the size of the defect relative to the dimensions of the layout patterns. Several analytical models were proposed to calculate the critical area from layout details <ref> [14, 27, 33] </ref>. The critical area for defects of size x is defined as the area in which the center of a defect must fall in order to cause a circuit failure. <p> Since the defect size distribution is inversely proportional to the defect size raised to the power of 3 <ref> [33] </ref>, change in the critical area will be nonuniform. <p> The critical area of the rectangular elements or regions is calculated using the analytical models presented in <ref> [14, 33] </ref>. Then, each non-critical element is searched in the breadth-first order for an optimal location. Elements can be moved only in the upward direction since all the elements are at the minimum possible location to start with. <p> As a result, defect sensitivity of the layouts belong to active regions remains almost unchanged, except for boundaries. Therefore, the results of these layers are omitted. The defect size distribution model by Stapper and Ferris-Prabhu <ref> [33, 14] </ref> is used for yield optization as well as defect sensitivity measurements. We assume the following values for different parameters of the model; x o = 0.5, p = 3.0, and q = 1.0. <p> Since the layouts were compacted in the vertical direction without auto-jogging, changes in the wire length of metal1 layer are minimal. Therefore, the percentage reduction in the pof is also negligible. We suspect that the small increase in the pof of open-circuit faults is due to the proximity effect <ref> [33] </ref>. In YKT-I, the pof for short- and open-circuit faults is reduced by 4.8 and 4.7%, respectively , in the metal-2 layer. However, in YKT-II, the reduction is negligible.

Reference-contexts: This can result in proportional improvements in defect sensitivity of the vertical layer. Due to this wire length reduction, the number of vias also reduced significantly (30%). In many examples, the via reduction results are better than the results reported by several via minimization algorithms <ref> [34] </ref>. This via reduction will further improve the defect sensitivity of the layouts.

We have formulated Wire length of the vertical layer in a two-layer routing as an Integer Linear Programming. To illustrate the wire length minimization, a simple example (example 1 of <ref> [36] </ref>) is shown in Figure 9. The original channel has 12 tracks and the total wire length of the vertical layer is 310 units.

This reduction in wire length results in similar reductions in the defect sensitivity of open- and short-circuit type faults. Wire length minimization achieved in the examples given in <ref> [36] </ref> is shown in Table 2. The average wire length reduction in these benchmark examples is 14.6%. This can result in proportional improvements in defect sensitivity of the vertical layer. Due to this wire length reduction, the number of vias also reduced significantly (30%).
