Title: Towards A Computer Model of Memory Search Strategy Learning

Abstract: Much recent research on modeling memory processes has focused on identifying useful indices and retrieval strategies to support particular memory tasks. Another important question concerning memory processes, however, is how retrieval criteria are learned. This paper examines the issues involved in modeling the learning of memory search strategies. It discusses the general requirements for appropriate strategy learning and presents a model of memory search strategy learning applied to the problem of retrieving relevant information for adapting cases in case-based reasoning. It discusses an implementation of that model, and, based on the lessons learned from that implementation, points towards issues and directions in refining the model.

Reference-contexts: Previous research has shown that because of the generality of abstract transformations, a wide range of adaptation problems can be solved using a small set of abstract transformations (e.g., <ref> (Carbonell, 1983) </ref>). However, a difficult problem is how to determine the features that are relevant in finding the information needed to apply the abstract rules to specific problems. For example, the rule substitute component gives no guidance about what to substitute.

Reference-contexts: For example, the rule substitute component gives no guidance about what to substitute. An example of human learning of relevance criteria for case adaptation is presented in <ref> (Gentner, 1988) </ref>. Gentner's experiments gave children the task of adapting previously-encountered stories to fit new characters. In the experiments, children first acted out stories, using toys to play the roles of the characters. They were then asked to act out the same stories using different toys representing new characters.

Reference-contexts: However, this model differs in treating memory search as a knowledge planning process <ref> (Hunter, 1990) </ref>. In the knowledge planning framework, information search is conducted by a planning process based on explicit reasoning about needs for information and how to satisfy them.

Reference-contexts: The Computer Model The theory is being tested in the computer system AL (Adaptation Learner). That system applies the planning framework described in the previous sections to the task of learning the search strategies hand coded as part of the adaptation strategies <ref> (Kass, 1990) </ref> in the case-based explanation systems SWALE (Schank, Riesbeck, & Kass, 1994) and ABE (Kass, 1990). <p> That system applies the planning framework described in the previous sections to the task of learning the search strategies hand coded as part of the adaptation strategies <ref> (Kass, 1990) </ref> in the case-based explanation systems SWALE (Schank, Riesbeck, & Kass, 1994) and ABE (Kass, 1990). To provide context and illustrate the role of adaptation strategies in those systems, we sketch SWALE's processing of its namesake example, the story of the racehorse Swale. 2 Swale was a 3-year-old superstar racehorse who died unexpectedly at the peak of his career. <p> A related issue is how to organize memory search plans in memory. In the initial system design, memory search information was packed with the transformations it operationalized to form adaptation strategies along the lines of those developed in <ref> (Kass, 1990) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: That approach seemed reasonable because the model can be viewed as oper-ationalizing a set of abstract transformation rules with search procedures, and EBG is a standard operationalization method <ref> (Keller, 1988) </ref>. However, EBG is not appropriate to the memory search task because a deductive explanation of why a memory search plan succeeds would be required to guide generalization.

Reference-contexts: Memory search as a planful process Our approach builds on the model of memory traversal and index elaboration in CYRUS <ref> (Kolodner, 1984) </ref>, and especially on prior proposals for introspective failure-driven learning to repair memory organization problems (Birnbaum, Collins, Brand, Freed, Krulwich, & Pryor, 1991; Ram & Cox, 1994). However, this model differs in treating memory search as a knowledge planning process (Hunter, 1990).

Reference-contexts: Memory Search for Case Adaptation Case-based reasoning (CBR) systems solve problems by retrieving similar stored cases and adapting their solutions to fit the new situations. The CBR model of reasoning from experience has been successfully applied to many tasks (see <ref> (Kolodner, 1993) </ref> for a survey), and initial studies are encouraging for its validity as a cognitive model (e.g., (Lancaster & Kolodner, 1988; Ross, 1989; Read & Cesa, 1991)). A fundamental question in CBR is how to guide the adaptation process that revises a retrieved case to fit a new situation. <p> However, in general it is difficult to anticipate which types of transformations will apply in a given case, and many conflicting factors may enter into the decision (see <ref> (Kolodner, 1993) </ref> for an extensive discussion of adaptation issues). The difficulty of balancing conflicting factors provides a strong functional motivation for developing a model in which experience can help to balance those conflicting factors to guide case adaptation. <p> It should be noted, however, that although that domain knowledge is useful, it is not essential. In the absence of domain knowledge, the initial search for information becomes an unguided local search process of the sort already commonly used to support case adaptation <ref> (Kolodner, 1993, pp. 407-410) </ref>, but the process can still learn to improve its search process by favoring search plans that were successful in similar prior situations. Treating the memory search process this way increases flexibility in selection, application and refinement of memory search strategies. <p> Applying similar adaptations to similar problems may help to improve the quality of the solutions generated by the adaptation system, just as case-based reasoning can improve the quality of solutions in imperfectly-understood domains <ref> (Kolodner, 1993) </ref>. An analysis of the effectiveness of this model must also examine its effect on the quality of adaptations. Conclusions This paper proposes treating memory search as a planful process guided by explicit reasoning about needs for information and the organization of memory.

Reference-contexts: considerable effort to learn new adaptation strategies, and even after they have been learned, it is not guaranteed that they will improve overall performance, because of the utility problem: It has been shown that the learning of control knowledge may actually degrade the performance of the system using that knowledge <ref> (Minton, 1990) </ref>, due to increased overhead costs overwhelming the savings from individual rules. The intention of this model is to address that problem by indexing learned memory search cases for efficient access, but the effectiveness of that approach must be validated.

Reference-contexts: Lessons Learned Although the described system is in preliminary form, it has brought to light some notable points. The first concerns the types of learning mechanisms that apply to the task. The system was initially envisioned as performing explanation-based generalization (EBG) <ref> (Mitchell, Keller, & Kedar-Cabelli, 1986) </ref> on the search plans that it generated. That approach seemed reasonable because the model can be viewed as oper-ationalizing a set of abstract transformation rules with search procedures, and EBG is a standard operationalization method (Keller, 1988).
