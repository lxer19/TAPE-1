Reference-contexts: In addition, we wanted it to be continually adaptive to robot capabilities and be a quickly converging algorithm suitable for anytime learning as described by Grefenstette and Ramsey (1992). To this end, cyclic genetic algorithms were developed <ref> (Parker and Rawlins, 1996) </ref>. They are capable of generating the proper sequence of primitive instructions that can be continually repeated to produce a gait. Tests showed that these quickly converging algorithms could produce optimal gaits on six-legged robot simulations. <p> Results Comparison of the CGA performance on the six-legged simulation robot using different chromosome structures at 2000 generations revealed that the fixed length chromosomes with inhibitors, coordinators, and the gene-by-gene operator were most effective in producing rapid convergence to an optimal gait <ref> (Parker and Rawlins, 1996) </ref>. A fitness of 9.5 (optimal for this model) was attained (Figure 14).

Reference-contexts: Static equilibrium can be measured by drawing a convex polygon around the insect connecting consecutive feet on the ground (Figure 6). The stability margin is the distance from the insects center of gravity to the nearest line in the polygon <ref> (Ting, Blickhan, and Full, 1994) </ref>. As long as the stability margin is above 0 the animal is statically stable. Our calculations were not made to this degree of accuracy.
