Abstract: The proof of Wagner's Conjecture by Robertson and Seymour gives a finite description of any family of graphs which is closed under the minor ordering. This description is a finite set of graphs called the obstructions of the family. Since the intersection and the union of two minor closed graph families is again a minor closed graph family, an interesting question is that of computing the obstructions of the new family given the obstructions for the original two families. It is easy to compute the obstructions of the intersection but, until very recently, it was an open problem to compute the obstructions of the union. We show that if the original families are planar then the obstructions of the union are no larger than n O(n 2 ) where n is the size of the largest obstruction of the original family.

Reference-contexts: This set of graphs is called the obstruction set of the family. Robertson and Seymour also show that for every fixed graph H, there is a polynomial time algorithm which checks if a graph G contains H as a minor <ref> [RSa] </ref>. Therefore, every lower ideal has a polynomial time membership test. It would thus seem that the Robertson and Seymour proof should give powerful techniques for devising graph-theoretic algorithms. However, the nonconstructive nature of some parts of this work make it, in general, difficult to apply to some problems.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Robertson and Seymour's proof of Wagner's conjecture <ref> [RSb] </ref> raises somes interesting computational questions. An immediate corollary of the theorem is that for every family of graphs closed under minors (called lower ideals), the set of minimal graphs outside the family is finite. This set of graphs is called the obstruction set of the family. <p> In 1978, Migram and Ungar [Ung78] independently also made the same conjecture and went on to compute the intertwines for a few specific examples. Robertson and Seymour's work directly implies that the minor intertwine must be finite. They also prove that the topological embedding intertwine is finite <ref> [RSb] </ref>. Until recently, no recursive bounds on the sizes of either minor or topological embedding intertwines were known, even for very restricted cases. Here, we obtain a bound of n O (n 2 ) for the size of planar intertwines of two planar graphs.

Reference-contexts: In related work, we also obtain a triply exponential bound on the size of the planar topological embedding intertwine of planar graphs [GI91]. Very recently, Seymour and Thomas <ref> [ST91] </ref> have given a general bound on the sizes of topological embedding intertwines using techniques developed in the Robertson-Seymour papers. In general, their bound is an iterated tower of 2's whose height is an iterated tower of 2's of height n. <p> The best lower bound for even topological embedding of general graphs is O (n 3 ) (see Figure 10) as compared to the upper bound of a tower of tower of 2's as given by Seymour and Thomas <ref> [ST91] </ref>. Although it is probably not difficult to obtain slight improvements in the lower bounds, 19 no natural candidates for the asymptotic complexity of this function presents itself. Further investigation of intertwine bounds may give insight into the enormous constants found in parts of the Robertson and Seymour proof.

Reference-contexts: The topological embedding intertwines have a number of properties which make their study simpler. In 1976, Lovasz conjectured that there were only a finite number of topological embedding intertwines. In 1978, Migram and Ungar <ref> [Ung78] </ref> independently also made the same conjecture and went on to compute the intertwines for a few specific examples. Robertson and Seymour's work directly implies that the minor intertwine must be finite. They also prove that the topological embedding intertwine is finite [RSb].
