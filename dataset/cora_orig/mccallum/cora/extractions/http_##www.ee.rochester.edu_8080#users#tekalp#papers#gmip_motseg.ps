Abstract: This paper presents pixel-based and region-based parametric motion segmentation methods for robust motion segmentation with the goal of aligning motion boundaries with those of real objects in a scene. We first describe a two-step iterative procedure for parametric motion segmentation by either motion-vector or motion-compensated intensity matching. We next present a region-based extension of this method, whereby all pixels within a pre-defined spatial region are assigned the same motion label. These pre-defined regions may be fixed- or variable-size blocks or arbitrary-shaped areas defined by color or texture uniformity. A particular combination of these pixel-based and region-based methods is then proposed as a complete algorithm to obtain the best possible segmentation results on a variety of image sequences. Experimental results showing the benefits of the proposed scheme are provided.

Reference-contexts: Motion detection is a special case of motion segmentation with only two segments corresponding to moving vs. stationary image regions (in the case of a stationary camera) or global vs. local motion regions (in the case of a moving camera) <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. Motion estimation refers to assigning a parametric or nonparametric motion vector to each pixel in the image; and is an integral part of motion segmentation. Motion detection, estimation, and segmentation are all plagued with two fundamental limitations: occlusion and aperture problems.

Reference-contexts: This paper attempts to achieve this latter goal without requiring extremely computationally demanding models and procedures. Various approaches exist in the literature for motion segmentation <ref> [3] </ref>, which may be grouped as: segmentation by affine clustering [4], segmentation by Hough transform analysis [5, 6], segmentation by MRF modeling [7], segmentation by mixture modeling [9], simultaneous motion estimation and 2 segmentation [10], segmentation by dominant motion estimation [11, 12, 13], and segmentation by change-detection-mask analysis with temporal integration <p> Section 6 demonstrates the performance of the proposed algorithm on some MPEG-4 test sequences. 2 BACKGROUND 2.1 2-D Dense Motion Field Estimation 2-D dense motion estimation methods are classified as block-based, optical-flow equation based, pel-recursive, and Bayesian methods <ref> [3] </ref>. Block-based motion compensation has been adopted in the international standards for digital video compression, such as H.261 and MPEG 1-2. <p> noted that the value of the smoothness parameter is important, since if the motion field is oversmoothed, characterization of motion over small regions becomes impossible. 2.2 Parametric Motion Modeling Parametric motion models can be used on a global or local basis for a more compact representation of the motion field <ref> [3] </ref>. Global models are suitable to describe camera motion, while local models can capture multiple motions and/or mild deformations. <p> Other parametric forms, such eight-parameter perspective or bilinear models, may be more suitable in some applications depending on the geometry of the projection <ref> [3] </ref>. 2.3 Clustering in the Affine-Parameter Space Motion segmentation by affine parameter clustering was first proposed by Wang and Adelson (W-A) [4].

W-A method starts with a large number, N , of seed blocks uniformly distributed over the image, and fits an affine model to the estimated motion field (optical flow) within each seed block. Then, the resulting affine parameter vectors are clustered to find representative affine motion models.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, one can first perform a color segmentation to obtain a set of candidate motion segments. Then, those segments which have the same motion can be merged to obtain the final motion segmentation map. Other approaches to region definition include mesh-based partitioning of the scene <ref> [20] </ref>, macro pixels (N fi N blocks) to improve the robustness of the pixel-based affine motion segmentation. <p> Examples of other region definition methods include texture segmentation and content-based mesh design <ref> [20] </ref>. * Temporal integration: The algorithm presented here computes a motion segmentation map between any two frames. It is possible to extend it to temporally integrate these maps to obtain more stable motion boundaries across successive frames. This is left as a future research topic. 17
