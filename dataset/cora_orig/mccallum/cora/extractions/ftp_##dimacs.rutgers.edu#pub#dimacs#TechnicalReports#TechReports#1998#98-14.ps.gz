Reference-contexts: The mathematical property of routing in such a scenario were recently studied by Guerin and Orda [GO97]. Methods for compact graph representation that can be used to aggregate topology information were studied in the past years. A spanner <ref> [PU88, PS89, ADD + 93] </ref> of a graph G is a subgraph G 0 that includes all the node of G but only a subset of the edges. <p> We term this factor the max distortion of the graph compression, or simply the distortion. The best known algorithm <ref> [ADD + 93] </ref> for spanners with stretch t requires O (b 1+1=t ) edges, where b is the number of border nodes, i.e., if a logarithmic distortion is acceptable the spanner size is a constant factor of the number of nodes. <p> At this stage we can use spanners with logarithmic distortion <ref> [ADD + 93] </ref> and the result requires only O (b) edges. Specifically, a (2 log 2 b + 1)-spanner with less than 2b edges can be found by a simple polynomial algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The best known algorithm [ADD + 93] for spanners with stretch t requires O (b 1+1=t ) edges, where b is the number of border nodes, i.e., if a logarithmic distortion is acceptable the spanner size is a constant factor of the number of nodes. Bartal <ref> [Bar96] </ref> suggests a tree representation for graphs with an average distortion of O (log n), where n is the number of nodes in the graph. The tree is not built from the edges of the original graph. All the above aggregation schemes work on undirected graphs. <p> Remember, that in practical cases, is expected to be larger than b by several orders of magnitude. Using Bartal's tree construction <ref> [Bar96] </ref> might be more appealing due to the fact that the resulted aggregated structure has a known structure (a tree), while the distortion remains logarithmic in b.

Reference-contexts: For large networks, the current solution is to partition the network into subdomains, and continue partitioning the subdomains recursively until the lower level where the subdomain is comprised of subnetworks <ref> [PNN96, CCS96] </ref>. At each level, control information is aggregated before shared with peer subdomains.

Reference-contexts: For large networks, the current solution is to partition the network into subdomains, and continue partitioning the subdomains recursively until the lower level where the subdomain is comprised of subnetworks <ref> [PNN96, CCS96] </ref>. At each level, control information is aggregated before shared with peer subdomains. <p> The tree is not built from the edges of the original graph. All the above aggregation schemes work on undirected graphs. However, in todays application and standards <ref> [PNN96] </ref>, reservations for each direction of the connection take different values. As a result, the network graph becomes directional, with edges that have different weights for the two directions. <p> In section 3 we describe the aggregation algorithm and analyze its performance, and in section 4 we simulate its performance. Finally we conclude by showing the applicability of our results to the PNNI standard. 2 Model and Notation We use the PNNI <ref> [PNN96] </ref> notation. A subnetwork comprised of V , a group of connected nodes, that is called a peer group. B V is a set of border nodes, i.e., nodes that have a direct link to a node outside of the peer group. <p> ratio No. of links max. max min ave var bad 4s deleted distortion 2.98 1.1003 1.90 0.3 3 2 1.04 1511.74 1.0386 173.85 131223 22 10 3.83 Table 3: Results for a graph with 100 nodes, 7 of them are border nodes 5 Applicability to PNNI In the PNNI standard <ref> [PNN96, section 3.3.8] </ref>, a network is aggregated ("complex node") by a star. A virtual node ("nucleus") is the interior reference point. <p> To cope with asymmetry, the standard allows "exceptions" of two types: a different value for a spoke of a certain border node, or a value for a "bypass" between two border nodes. In guidelines that are supplied with the standard <ref> [PNN96, Appendix C] </ref> it is recommended that the number of exceptions used to configure a complex node will be kept smaller than 3b, where b is the number of border nodes. There is no suggestion of how to select exceptions.

Reference-contexts: The mathematical property of routing in such a scenario were recently studied by Guerin and Orda [GO97]. Methods for compact graph representation that can be used to aggregate topology information were studied in the past years. A spanner <ref> [PU88, PS89, ADD + 93] </ref> of a graph G is a subgraph G 0 that includes all the node of G but only a subset of the edges. <p> For routing, the edge weight is usually a function of the residual bandwidth or the average delay on the link, and these, in case of asymmetric traffic, might have orders of magnitude differences. For general digraphs, Peleg and Schaffer <ref> [PS89] </ref> show that for any t, a t-spanner might require (n 2 ) links. In other words, for certain directed graphs, no compact representation with bounded distortion exists.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the distortion for the spanner is the same as the one for tree, i.e., in the range (w (u; v)= p p - 6 - 4 Simulation Results To check the affect of the link deletion procedure, we produce random graphs according to Waxman's method <ref> [Wax88] </ref>. In the graph creation process, links are added until all nodes reach a minimum node degree of two. Links that increase node degree over 6 are rejected. This way the resulted graphs have both the clustering effect of close nodes and a relative high diameter.
