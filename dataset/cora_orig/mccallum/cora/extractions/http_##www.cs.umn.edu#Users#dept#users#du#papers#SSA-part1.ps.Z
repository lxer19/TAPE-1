Abstract: Several serial storage interfaces have been proposed for constructing storage systems with high transfer bandwidth, large storage capacity, and fault tolerance feature. Among them, Serial Storage Architecture (SSA) and Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL) are considered as the next generation storage interfaces with broad industry support. Both technologies support simple cabling, long transmission distance, high data bandwidth, large capacity, fault tolerance, and fair sharing of link bandwidth. In this paper, a tutorial and a comparison of these two technologies are presented. The tutorial examines their interface specifications, transport protocols, fairness algorithms, and capabilities of fault tolerance. The comparison focuses on their protocol overhead, flow control, fairness algorithms, and fault tolerance. The paper also summarizes the recently proposed Aaron Proposal which incorporates features from both SSA and FC-AL and targets at merging these two technologies.

Reference-contexts: The experiment result shows the impact of SCSI's unfair bus arbitration, especially when the SCSI is heavily loaded. Several serial storage interfaces with higher data transfer rates were developed as alternatives which may solve some of the SCSI's problems discussed before. These interfaces include Serial Storage Architecture (SSA) <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL) [4, 5], IEEE P1394 serial bus [9]. A serial interface uses compact connectors and serial links to simplify cabling schemes and reduce the cost.

Reference-contexts: The protocols that Fibre Channel supports include SCSI, Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI), High-Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI), Internet Protocol (IP). There is one FC-4 mapping protocol for each supported upper layer protocol. In Section 3.1.2, we will describe one of the FC-4 protocols, Fibre Channel Protocol for SCSI <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.1.1 Fibre Channel Physical and Signaling Interface (FC-PH) FC-PH defines three of Fibre Channel's functional layers, from FC-0 to FC-2. FC-0 (Physical Layer) specifies a variety of physical media, drivers and receivers for a wide range of transmission speeds.

FC-AL <ref> [4, 5] </ref> is an enhancement to the Fibre Channel standards. It defines additional signals and control mechanism to support Fibre Channel for operating with the loop. In a loop topology, communicating devices share a loop interface which only supports one pair of nodes to communicate at a time.

Reference-contexts: FC-AL operates with 100 MB/sec link bandwidth. It provides high data bandwidth, fault 2 tolerance, and an optional fairness algorithm. It supports any combination of hosts and storage devices up to a total of 127 in a single loop. As an enhancement to the Fibre Channel standard <ref> [7] </ref>, devices in FC-AL can be connected by copper cables for low-cost storage attachment or optical cables for long distance transmission up to 10km with single-mode fiber optics. <p> Then we describe FC-AL in Section 3.2. 3.1 Fibre Channel Fibre Channel has five functional layers as shown in Figure 10. Among them, FC-0 to FC-2 are defined in Fibre Channel Physical and Signaling Interface (FC-PH) <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: However, both of them have advantages and disadvantages. We believe that further studies are necessary to investigate the impact of their features on their performance for different applications. In a companion paper <ref> [8] </ref>, we have investigated the performance of both SSA and FC-AL under different types of traffic loads. The results not only allow us to understand their behavior but also can be used to effectively utilize the two technologies for potential applications.

A serial interface uses compact connectors and serial links to simplify cabling schemes and reduce the cost. To reduce the cost of connection per device, it allows a large number (ranging from tens to more than one hundred) of storage devices attached to a single physical interface.
