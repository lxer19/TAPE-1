Abstract: In 1992, the CEC agreed to finance a one-year project called "Piloting of Multimedia Integrated Services for European Researchers (MICE)". This paper outlines the background, purpose and aims of the project. The technical work required to interconnect existing facilities, and issues relating to influencing factors such as standards and infrastructure are discussed in detail. In conclusion, we provide an outlook on the future of multimedia conferencing and highlights some of the next steps to be taken.

Reference-contexts: One such system is the BBN-supplied, DARPA-financed, Distributed Simulation system of Section 5.3 (MM-CONF) [19]. Others have been developed under the CAR system using a form of Shared-X <ref> [14] </ref>. It is a form of the CAR system that will be combined with the XConfer system from Nottingham University/Xtel that use a generalised mechanism for sharing the applications, and will be adopted for the early stages of MICE Shared Workspace and Conference Control.

These determine framing standards, but describe the other elements in such a way that they can be passed through different networks and be reconstituted at the destinations.
