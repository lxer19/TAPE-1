Abstract: Current proposals for feedback flow control in broadband networks include the use of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) bits, which carry information about congestion inside the network. The effectiveness of ECN-based control methods depend on the number of ECN bits used and the delay cells carrying these bits incur before reaching the source. We develop a stochastic fluid model for a single virtual circuit that captures both the ECN feedback information and the sharing of transmission resources with other virtual circuits. We apply statistical estimation techniques to estimate the instantaneous level of congestion inside the network and define a flow control policy based on these estimates. We evaluate the performance of our control policy through simulation. In particular, we compare loss probabilities as a function of the number of ECN bits and the feedback delay. Finally, we compare our flow control method to the popular leaky-bucket method.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In packet networks based on virtual circuits, all packets from a source to a destination will travel through the same physical resources. Therefore the network can notify the source if congestion occurs. Two traditional methods for dealing with congestion include choke packets <ref> [1] </ref> and window-based methods. In the first method, when a switch node detects congestion it sends a special control packet, called a choke packet, back to the source. The source reacts by reducing (or even blocking) its traffic input rate.

Reference-contexts: The ambiguity of timeout signals often leads to unnecessary packet retransmission or un-derutilization of network resources. A more direct approach using a single bit to indicate congestion to the source was first proposed in <ref> [2] </ref>. When a network node detects congestion, it sets a header bit in packets traversing that node. When the destination receives these packets, it averages out the bits from multiple packets, and decides whether the source should reduce its load. This decision is then sent back to the source. <p> These two problems, on the effectiveness of ECN as a function of the feedback delay and the number of ECN bits, are the main focus of this paper. Other feedback congestion control schemes have been proposed for high-speed networks in <ref> [3, 2, 4, 5, 6] </ref>. Traditionally, in analyzing the sharing of transmission resources within the network, one needs to model the details of the operation of the server. The analysis becomes more difficult if the feedback information is delayed.

Reference-contexts: We make several assumptions in our model. We assume a virtual circuit connection, possibly spanning several switches, can be modeled by a single node <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. The information sent by the destination is modeled by a FECN signal from the node to the source. We use a discrete-time model in which the unit of time is the time between two consecutive FECN signals.

We assume that the forward path from the source to the node takes one time unit and the feedback path is a constant d units of time. The model is depicted in Figure 1 for the case of 1-bit FECN.

The results are organized as follows. A time trace of the buffer state estimator is presented first. <p> This illustrates how the estimator tracks the buffer state at the network node. We present the performance of the controller in x5.2 for two networks types. In x5.3, we compare the performance of our scheme with that of a leaky bucket controller. For more detailed simulation results, see <ref> [12] </ref>. An approximate error analysis is presented in [13]. In the simulations, we chose the average service rate of the virtual circuit to be 10 buffer units per time unit, and operate the VC at 80% load. <p> The time unit in network Type II (approximately DS3 transmission rates) is .8ms, therefore a delay of 12 corresponds to an approximate network delay of 10ms. As expected, the performance of the two schemes are close when the delay is large. For further discussion of this behavior see <ref> [13, 12] </ref> 13 6 Summary In this paper, we investigated the effectiveness of a feedback flow control scheme in networks with explicit congestion notification.
