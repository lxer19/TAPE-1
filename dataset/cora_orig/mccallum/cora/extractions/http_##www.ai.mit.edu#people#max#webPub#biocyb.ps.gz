Abstract: The Self-Organizing Map (SOM), a widely used algorithm for the unsupervised learning of neural maps, can be formulated in a low-dimensional "feature map" variant which requires prespecified parameters ("features") for the description of receptive fields, or in a more general high-dimensional variant which allows to self-organize the structure of individual receptive fields as well as their arrangement in a map. We present here a new analytical method to derive conditions for the emergence of structure in SOMs which is particularly suited for the as yet inaccessible high-dimensional SOM variant. Our approach is based on an evaluation of a map distortion function. It involves only an ansatz for the way stimuli are distributed among map neurons; the receptive fields of the map need not be known explicitely. Using this method we first calculate regions of stability for four possible states of SOMs projecting from a rectangular input space to a ring of neurons. We then analyze the transition from non-oriented to oriented receptive fields in a SOM-based model for the development of orientation maps. In both cases, the analytical results are well corroborated by the results of computer simulations. submitted to Biological Cybernetics, December 14, 1995 revised version, July 14, 1996

Reference-contexts: that neuron s whose receptive field w s has the largest overlap with the stimulus, s = arg max (w r v) : (2.2) This amounts to a winner-take-all rule, a strong nonlinearity which in a biological context is explained as a consequence of a strong nonlinear lateral cortical interaction <ref> (Kohonen, 1993, 1995) </ref>. The SOM is adapted to a specific projection task by appropriate changes of the receptive field vectors w r .

Reference-contexts: Such a constellation is numerically observed (Fig. 2f) and stable; it is analogous to a low-dimensional SOFM which tries to cover a strongly bent input space and has to spend a few neurons in "empty space" in order to do so <ref> (see Fig. 3.7 in Kohonen, 1995, as an example) </ref>. * The stimuli can also be split among all four neurons, with each neuron being best-matching for a quarter of the stimuli. Several shapes of the corresponding tesselation regions are imaginable, some of which are observed (Figs. 2b-e,g-j).

Reference-contexts: Here, stimuli in a sensory layer are projected in a topographic fashion onto the neurons of the map. In the high-dimensional SOM, the stimuli are formally described by an activity distribution over many sensory channels which make up the sensory layer <ref> (Obermayer et al., 1990a, Obermayer et al., 1990b, Goodhill, 1993) </ref>. Correspondingly, the receptive fields of the neurons are described as synaptic weight distributions in the high-dimensional space of sensory channels.

Reference-contexts: Examples where this reduction to a so-called self-organizing feature map (SOFM) has been used include models for the formation of orientation and ocular dominance maps <ref> (Obermayer et al., 1992, Bauer, 1995) </ref> as well as the modeling of retinotopic maps (see, e.g., Wolf et al., 1994). In the latter case, the relevant features are the retinal positions of stimuli and receptive fields, given by their resp. centers of gravity only. <p> Using elongated ellipses as stimuli, these authors showed that the SOM-algorithm is able to generate orientation maps as observed in the visual cortex. Maps which were driven with stimuli of small or no elongation failed to develop orientation-sensitive cells and, consequently, an orientation map <ref> (Obermayer, 1992) </ref>. Here we set out to calculate the properties of the transition between a map of orientation-insensitive cells, resulting from stimuli with weak orientation, and a map of orientation-sensitive cells, resulting from more strongly oriented stimuli. <p> For orientation columns to emerge, a critical eccentricity has to be exceeded, with the critical value of 2 = 1 being proportional to the neighborhood width <ref> (Obermayer et al., 1992) </ref>. So for the SOFM, 1 and the critical 2 are related by a multiplicative constant, whereas in the case of the SOM it is an additive constant, a somewhat surprising difference.

Reference-contexts: For SOFMs with mismatching input and out put space dimensions, consideration of the fluctuations of the map about a state with 5 trivial structure led to conditions on the parameters when the trivial state ceases to be stable <ref> (Ritter and Schulten, 1988) </ref>. For parameter values beyond the critical ones, the map evolves to a different state (the structure of which, however, is not revealed by this analysis). A similar method to determine instabilities in high-dimensional SOMs has as yet not been available.

Reference-contexts: In more explicit form, cortical competition by lateral inhibition was already incorporated in other, less abstracted models (Malsburg, 1973) and was recently observed in a highly detailed simulation of cortical response properties to oriented stimuli <ref> (Somers et al., 1995) </ref>. Second, high-dimensional SOM-models as investigated in this paper describe and self-organize receptive fields in terms of synaptic weight distributions. This level of description avoids the often used feature map approximation and thus is easier to interpret in biological terms.
