Abstract: Many researchers who study the theoretical aspects of inference systems believe that if inference rule A is complete and more restrictive than inference rule B, the use of A will lead more quickly to proofs than will the use of B. The literature contains statements of the sort "our rule is complete and it heavily prunes the search space; therefore it is efficient." 2 These positions are highly questionable and indicate that the authors have little or no experience with the practical use of automated inference systems. Restrictive rules (1) can block short, easy-to-find proofs, (2) can block proofs involving simple clauses, the type of clause on which many practical searches focus, (3) can require weakening of redundancy control such as subsumption and demodulation, and (4) can require the use of complex checks in deciding whether such rules should be applied. The only way to determine the practical value of inference rules and search strategies is to experiment on problems in which long-term target users are interested. In this article we present a new theorem prover for equational logic, a set of 33 equational theorems for evaluating paramodulation strategies, a large set of experiments with several paramodulation strategies, and two equational proofs in Robbins algebra. The new theorem prover, EQP, includes associative-commutative unification and is restricted to equational logic, but in many other ways it is similar to our production theorem prover Otter [11]. The 33 equational theorems, which are mostly about lattice-like and group-like structures, are taken from a recent interdisciplinary study on the application of Otter to problems in equational logic [12]. The experiments are with basic paramodulation, blocked paramodulation, ordered-instance paramodulation, functional subsumption, a heuristic for eliminating associative-commutative unifiers, and methods for directing the search. The two Robbins algebra theorems, which involve the hypotheses 9C9D (C + D = C) 2 This is a very general statement. We are not referring in particular to the paramodulation strategies on which we focus in this article.

Reference-contexts: Basic Paramodulation. This strategy applies to non-AC and to AC experiments. Basic paramodulation <ref> [1, 14] </ref> is a restriction that prevents paramodulation into terms that arise solely by instantiation. One way to view this (and a way to implement it) is to represent clauses as a pair, hskeleton,substitutioni. <p> Demodulation with basic paramodulation is more problematic. The standard definitions of demodulation with basic paramodulation (e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>) do not allow demodulation of nonbasic terms. This restriction seems intuitively unwise because we wish to simplify wherever possible; some preliminary experiments (not reported here) support our position, so EQP ignores that restriction.

Reference-contexts: The most important two differences from Otter are that EQP includes AC unification and it applies to equational problems only. Also, EQP is much simpler and easier to extend. An early version of EQP was used for several experiments with algorithms for distributed equational reasoning (see, for example, <ref> [2] </ref>). Similarities between Otter and EQP 1. Design philosophy and the C programming language. 2. The overall structure of the programs. 3. Unification and matching algorithms (excluding AC unification). 4. The term and literal indexing algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Winker's proofs are higher order in the sense that they use induction, so EQP's proofs are seen as the first equational proofs of the lemmas.

Reference-contexts: The (unfortunately named) "basic paramodulation" is one of the strategies we evaluate in this article. 6 This inference system has been in use at Argonne in various forms since about 1977.

Reference-contexts: most of the paramodula-tion strategies we considered, we ran experiments with ratios 1, 4, 8, and 1 (i.e., purely best-first). (We used a value of 4 for almost all of the experiments reported in [12].) 5.5.2 Associative-Commutative (AC) Operations EQP has AC unification (Stickel's AC algorithm [18], with Huet's algorithm <ref> [5] </ref> for finding basis solutions) and AC matching (our own algorithm). The AC unification algorithm is quite complicated, but our implementation is straightforward. AC terms are stored as binary terms in canonical form, and they are flattened into arrays during the unification process.

Reference-contexts: Blocked paramodulation does not allow a paramodulation inference if any term in the unifier can be rewritten with the current set of demodulators. The strategy was discussed by Lankford and proved complete in the context of completion by Kapur, Musser, and Narendran <ref> [6] </ref>. The justification is that an unblocked inference is composite and thus can be factored into prime inferences, and that only prime inferences are needed for completion.

Reference-contexts: EQP's AC matching code is separate from its AC unification code. Our implementation, which does not solve Diophantine equations, uses some ideas from RRL <ref> [7] </ref>. It is a backtracking algorithm that binds variables to all appropriate combinations of terms. The speed of AC matching is extremely important, because we 80 Chapter 5 find that in practice, most of the time is spent rewriting derived clauses. <p> to a potential unifier, then no supersets of S are considered; a value of 1 means to consider supersets of size jSj + 1, and so on. 9 The strategy is obviously incomplete, because it eliminates most-general AC unifiers. 9 A method similar to ac-superset-limit=0 has been used in RRL <ref> [7] </ref>. 33 Basic Test Problems: A Practical Evaluation of Some Paramodulation Strategies 83 Functional Subsumption. This strategy applies to non-AC and to AC experiments. Functional subsumption is a simple extension of ordinary subsumption.

Reference-contexts: AC terms are stored as binary terms in canonical form, and they are flattened into arrays during the unification process. Unifiers are generated incrementally on demand by a backtracking algorithm. We have not implemented Kapur and Zhang's check for symmetry among AC unifiers <ref> [8] </ref>, and we do not use any indexing for finding AC-unifiable terms. Experience continues to show us that the speed of AC unification is not particularly important, because in practice the percentage of time spent there is small, but elimination of unnecessary or undesirable AC unifiers is extremely important. <p> For the AC problems, blocked paramodulation had greater effects, both positive and negative, when compared with the starting strategy. These results were unexpected because Kapur and Zhang <ref> [8] </ref> report excellent results for blocked AC-paramodulation on ring problems. 5.8 Robbins Algebra In this section we present two results in Robbins algebra obtained with EQP's AC unification and matching, then present a small case study on the easier result and one experiment on the more difficult result.

Reference-contexts: The ordered-instance paramodulation restriction prevents paramodulation in such cases. Nearly all current theoretical work on paramodulation strategies uses ordered-instance paramodulation, but Otter, for example, does not. Early work in this area was in the context of completion <ref> [9] </ref>. Blocked Paramodulation. This strategy applies to non-AC and to AC experiments. Blocked paramodulation does not allow a paramodulation inference if any term in the unifier can be rewritten with the current set of demodulators.

Reference-contexts: The term and literal indexing algorithms. Both programs (excluding EQP with AC unification) use discrimination tree indexing for retrieval of demodulators and subsuming clauses, and both use FPA-Path indexing for retrieval of unifiable terms during paramodulation and instance terms during back demodulation <ref> [10] </ref>. 5. Input and output languages. 6. Noninteractive use of the programs. 7. Performance of the programs. Differences between Otter and EQP 1. Otter and EQP share very little code. 2. Otter uses extensive structure sharing, which decreases memory consumption but complicates the algorithms and code.

The theorems are in a narrow area: from the syntactic view, all are equational, in languages with small sets of symbols, and most have small sets of small equations; from the semantic view, most are about simple lattice-like algebras and simple group-like algebras. <p> However, we have not carefully analyzed for completeness the compatibility of the restrictions with our starting strategy or with each other. Our (extensive) use of the max-weight parameter obviously causes incompleteness. 5.4 EQP: The New Theorem Prover We have been working on Otter <ref> [11] </ref> since 1988. It is a mature and stable program, with perhaps forty serious users. However, it has become difficult to work on because of its size and its many kludges, patches, and extraneous features.

If max-weight is listed, it was used for all experiments; otherwise no limit was used in any experiment.
