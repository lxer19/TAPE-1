Abstract: When triangulating a belief network we aim to obtain a junction tree of minimum state space. According to (Rose, 1970), searching for the optimal triangulation can be cast as a search over all the permutations of the graph's vertices. Our approach is to embed the discrete set of permutations in a convex continuous domain D. By suitably extending the cost function over D and solving the continous nonlinear optimization task we hope to obtain a good triangulation with respect to the aformentioned cost. This paper presents two ways of embedding the triangulation problem into continuous domain and shows that they perform well compared to the best known heuristic.

Reference-contexts: The set of doubly stochastic matrices fi is a convex polytope of dimension (n 1) 2 whose extreme points are the permutation matrices <ref> (Balinski and Russakoff, 1974) </ref>. Thus, every doubly stochastic matrix can be represented as a convex combination of permutation matrices.

Reference-contexts: An optimization method based on simulated annealing which performs better than the heuristics on large graphs has been proposed in (Kjrulff, 1991) and recently a "divide and conquer" algorithm which bounds the maximum clique size of the triangulated graph has been published <ref> (Becker and Geiger, 1996) </ref>. All but the last algorithm are based on Rose's (Rose, 1970) elimination procedure: choose a node v of the graph, connect all its neighbors to form a clique, then eliminate v and all the edges incident to it and proceed recursively.

Reference-contexts: means that node v is the i-th node to be eliminated according to ordering #, by n (v) the set of neighbors of v 2 V in the triangulated graph and by C v = fvg [ fu 2 n (v) j #u &gt; #vg. 2 Then, a result in <ref> (Golumbic, 1980) </ref> allows us to express the total weight of the junction tree obtained with elimination ordering # as J fl X ismax (C v ) Y r u (1) where ismax (C v ) is a variable which is 1 when C v is a maximal clique and 0 otherwise.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this is a hard problem. No optimal triangulation algorithm is known to date. However, a number of heuristic algorithms like maximum cardinality search (Tarjan and Yannakakis, 1984), lexicographic search (Rose et al., 1976) and the minimum weight heuristic (MW) <ref> (Kjrulff, 1990) </ref> are known. An optimization method based on simulated annealing which performs better than the heuristics on large graphs has been proposed in (Kjrulff, 1991) and recently a "divide and conquer" algorithm which bounds the maximum clique size of the triangulated graph has been published (Becker and Geiger, 1996). <p> The results in the following section will confirm this. 4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS To assess the performance of our algorithms we compared their results with the results of the minimum weight heuristic (MW), the heuristic that scored best in empirical tests <ref> (Kjrulff, 1990) </ref>. The lowest junction tree weight obtained in 200 runs of MW was retained and denoted by J fl MW .

Reference-contexts: If a graph is not triangulated it is always possible to add new edges so that the resulting graph is triangulated. We shall call this procedure triangulation and the added edges the fill-in. In the final stage, the junction tree <ref> (Kjrulff, 1991) </ref> is constructed from the maximal cliques of the triangulated graph. <p> An optimization method based on simulated annealing which performs better than the heuristics on large graphs has been proposed in <ref> (Kjrulff, 1991) </ref> and recently a "divide and conquer" algorithm which bounds the maximum clique size of the triangulated graph has been published (Becker and Geiger, 1996).

Reference-contexts: But the former situation means that there will be only a small number of small size non-maximal cliques to contribute to the difference J J fl , and therefore that the agreement with J fl is usually closer than (3) implies. This conclusion is supported by simulations <ref> (Meila and Jordan, 1997) </ref>. 2 Both n (v) and C v depend on # but we chose not to emphasize this in the notation for the sake of readability. 3 THE CONTINUOUS OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM This section shows two ways of defining J over continuous domains.

Reference-contexts: It is therefore critical that the triangulation procedure produces a graph that is optimal or at least "good" in this respect. Unfortunately, this is a hard problem. No optimal triangulation algorithm is known to date. However, a number of heuristic algorithms like maximum cardinality search <ref> (Tarjan and Yannakakis, 1984) </ref>, lexicographic search (Rose et al., 1976) and the minimum weight heuristic (MW) (Kjrulff, 1990) are known.
