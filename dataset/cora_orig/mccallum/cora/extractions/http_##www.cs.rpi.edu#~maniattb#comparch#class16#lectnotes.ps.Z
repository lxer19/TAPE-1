Abstract: 4 Basic Cache Principles A cache is a small amount of fast memory used to store frequently accessed data. In this chapter we consider caches used to speed up main memory accesses, which means:

Consider the reference string <ref> [1] </ref>: ! = 1; 2; 3; 4; 1; 2; 5; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5 (2) Derive the number of replacements done when: * 3 frames are used * 4 frames are used Computer Architectures 75425 W.
