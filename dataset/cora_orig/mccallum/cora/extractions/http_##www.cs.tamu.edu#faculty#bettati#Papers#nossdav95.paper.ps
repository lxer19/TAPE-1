Abstract: There is considerable interest in the network community in supporting real-time multi-party applications, such as video conferencing. The Tenet Group at UC Berkeley and ICSI has designed and implemented protocols that provide quality of service (QoS) guarantees for real-time traffic on packet switching networks. Suite 2 of the Tenet protocols provides scalable, flexible and efficient network support for real-time multi-party connections. We outline our method of connection establishment and describe the design issues and alternatives, and our decisions. Preliminary measurements confirm the viability of our approach for real time multicast connection establishment.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The design goals and principles of multicast real-time channel establishment in the Tenet Suite 2 are described, along with the mechanisms that support the establishment procedure. The suite described in this paper is based on the Tenet Suite 1 <ref> [1] </ref>. Therefore, the approach taken in Suite 1 is described in Section 2. The changes made to that approach to adapt it to the multicast abstraction in Suite 2, and a step-by-step example of Suite 2 channel setup are give in Section 3. <p> In the Tenet Scheme 1, which is the set of algorithms and procedures on which the Tenet Suite 1 <ref> [1] </ref> is based, a channel is a simplex unicast connection with QoS guarantees [4]. <p> Considering that we do not cache TCP connections, these results are not too different from the connection establishment latencies measured for the unicast Suite 1 <ref> [1] </ref>. For the latter, the time for channel establishment was measured to be between 80 and 90 ms for unicast channels with six hops between Berkeley and San Diego, California.

Reference-contexts: Channel objects maintain channel state. Target set objects maintain information related to data receivers, and provide a rendezvous point between senders and receivers. A target set is similar to a host group in IP multicast <ref> [2] </ref>, except that a target set specifies performance requirements for each destination. When a destination joins (leaves) a target set, the target set requests the channel objects associated with it to add (remove) the destination to (from) their respective multicast trees. 3.2 Example of Channel Establishment Fig. 2.

Reference-contexts: The limitations of the sender-initiated scheme have been identified, and two extensions for receiver-initiated connection establishment have been proposed in the IBM ENC ST-II implementation <ref> [3] </ref>. The first extension ("Join Stream at Router") moves the join request in-band and allows routers that are part of the multicast tree to act as senders and to issue a connect request to the new receiver.

Reference-contexts: In the Tenet Scheme 1, which is the set of algorithms and procedures on which the Tenet Suite 1 [1] is based, a channel is a simplex unicast connection with QoS guarantees <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> Scalability: The procedure must work also in very large networks and in ternetworks [6].

Reference-contexts: The main design objectives of the Tenet channel establishment procedure since the beginning of our investigation in 1987 were: Speed: Many real-time clients cannot afford long waits for their transmis sions to start <ref> [5] </ref>. Scalability: The procedure must work also in very large networks and in ternetworks [6]. Mathematical provability of the guarantees: Real-time clients must be offered firm contractual commitments by the service provider [4, 11].

Reference-contexts: One or more resource partition (s) can be dedicated for channels that reserve resources in advance of their use. Admission control is somewhat more complicated for these "advance-booked channels"; <ref> [7] </ref> describes these admission control mechanisms. Several long-lived objects have been introduced to ease the creation and management of multi-party communication in Scheme 2. Channel objects maintain channel state. Target set objects maintain information related to data receivers, and provide a rendezvous point between senders and receivers. <p> Also, simulations show that the computational overhead associated with admission control does not increase appreciably with the addition of resource sharing [9] and advance reservations mechanisms <ref> [7] </ref>. As a final note, we performed the same experiment on a similar topology of DECstations and measured an average round-trip time of 100 ms. The average start-up cost (i.e., Step 2 through Step 7) was 3.5 ms with an average per-node cost of 4 ms at each signalling object.

Reference-contexts: However, worst-case does not necessarily mean deterministic: from the outset, the Tenet Scheme 1 included statistical bounds for delays and packet losses, which were based on statistical worst-case techniques. Mathematical provability was also responsible for the decision to allocate buffers statically to each channel in each node <ref> [8] </ref>. 3 Multi-Party Connection Establishment We first discuss our goals for multi-party communication and their implications for channel establishment.

Reference-contexts: However, two changes are required in the data forwarding system: to support multicast channels, packets must be copied at branching nodes, and, to support resource sharing, the packet scheduling mechanism must be modified <ref> [9] </ref>. Implementing multi-party communication with unicast channels would be cumbersome and inefficient in the use of network resources. <p> Admission control tests and packet scheduling mechanisms use the group traffic specification rather than the traffic specifications for the individual channels. More details on resource sharing and results of simulation experiments can be found in <ref> [9] </ref>. Those experiments indicate that resource sharing significantly improves the scalability of multi-party communication. In Scheme 2, the real-time channel is a multicast connection. Therefore, the channel establishment procedure attempts to produce a multicast connection from the source to all destinations. <p> Also, simulations show that the computational overhead associated with admission control does not increase appreciably with the addition of resource sharing <ref> [9] </ref> and advance reservations mechanisms [7]. As a final note, we performed the same experiment on a similar topology of DECstations and measured an average round-trip time of 100 ms.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, since the routing function is a part of, or interacts with, the respective setup protocol, resource availability is known at routing time. This allows for QoS guarantees to be given whenever a connection has successfully been established. Originally, connection establishment in ST-II was rigorously sender-oriented <ref> [10] </ref>. In order for receivers to join, they had to inform the sender out-of-band, prompting it to generate a connection request for the receiver wishing to join.
