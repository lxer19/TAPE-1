This way of collecting a dual solution was introduced by Agrawal, Klein and Ravi in <ref> [1] </ref>. Each of these greedy cuts around terminals is considered an active block of the partition defining a multicut in the dual solution. All the nodes of the graph not in an active block together form an inactive block in the multicut partition.

Reference-contexts: When m = 1, we have the classical Steiner tree problem where a single tree of minimum cost spanning all the terminals is required. The Steiner forest problem was introduced by Duin and Volgenant <ref> [4] </ref> motivated by the following application. A tree in the forest spanning a subset of the terminals represents establishing a service for the terminals in the tree. The cost of the tree may be taken to be the cost of providing the service.

Reference-contexts: The Steiner tree problem is one of the first few problems proved NP-complete by Karp in [10]. Since then, much work has gone towards finding exact and approximate solutions to the problem [7, 8, 9, 18, 19]. Several researchers <ref> [5, 14, 16, 17] </ref> have independently provided approximation algorithms for this problem with performance ratio 2 (1 1 k ) where k is the number of terminals specified to be connected in the problem.

Reference-contexts: However, Mehlhorn showed that this alternative graph can be computed using just one single-source shortest-path computation. This takes time O (n log n + m) using Fredman and Tarjan's implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm <ref> [6] </ref>. Running the MST algorithm in this alternative graph until at most q components result and converting this to a q-Steiner forest can be accomplished in this time as well.

Reference-contexts: Several researchers [5, 14, 16, 17] have independently provided approximation algorithms for this problem with performance ratio 2 (1 1 k ) where k is the number of terminals specified to be connected in the problem. There have been several efficient algorithms devised to provide such an approximation <ref> [11, 13, 20] </ref> and the best-known running time for such an algorithm is that of Mehlhorn [13]. Mehlhorn's algorithm runs in time O (n log n + m) where n and m are the number of nodes and edges in the input graph respectively.

Reference-contexts: This proves the running time in Theorem 1.1. 4 6 Remarks It is not hard to see that the algorithm reduces to a truncated version of Kruskal's algorithm for MSTs <ref> [12] </ref> in the case of q-spanning forests addressed in Theorem 1.2. At any step in Kruskal's algorithm when x edges have been added to the solution, these edges form a minimum-cost set of x edges that induce an acyclic subgraph.

Mehlhorn's algorithm runs in time O (n log n + m) where n and m are the number of nodes and edges in the input graph respectively. Zelikovsky [21] devised the first approximation algorithm with a better performance ratio. <p> This is because the uniform breadth-first growth of the active blocks would cause exactly the shortest-paths between distinct active blocks to be picked in the same order in which they would be picked by the MST algorithm. We can now use the algorithm of Mehlhorn <ref> [13] </ref> to compute an auxiliary graph that is equivalent to the one we described above in terms of running the MST algorithm. However, Mehlhorn showed that this alternative graph can be computed using just one single-source shortest-path computation.
