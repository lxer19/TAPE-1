Abstract: We present a very practical string-commitment scheme which is provably secure based solely on collision-free hashing. Our scheme enables a computationally bounded party to commit strings to an unbounded one, and is optimal (within a small constant factor) in terms of interaction, communication, and computation. Our result also proves that constant round statistical zero-knowledge arguments and constant-round computational zero-knowledge proofs for

Reference-contexts: Blum's scheme calls for one or two modular multiplications and a k-bit commitment string for every bit which is being committed to (where k is the size of the composite modulus). A similar construction with the same efficiency parameters was later described by Brassard and Crepeau <ref> [4] </ref>. A more efficient construction, which is also based on the hardness of factoring, was introduced by Goldwasser, Micali and Rivest [12].

Reference-contexts: Fig. 2. A simple commitment-scheme. h is a universal hash-function and M D is a message-digest function. The first scheme. The first scheme uses universal hashing as a tool for "adding randomness" to the message. Universal hashing was introduced by Carter and Wegman <ref> [7] </ref> and it plays a very important role in many areas of computer-science. Intuitively, a family of hash functions H = fh : A ! Bg is universal if picking a function at random from H "has the same effect" as picking a totaly random function from A to B. <p> See Figure 3 for an illustration of the modified scheme. 2 Preliminaries 2.1 Universal Hashing Universal hashing was introduced by Carter and Wegman <ref> [7] </ref> and it plays a very important role in many areas of computer-science. Let S and T be two sets, and let H be a family of functions from S to T .

In particular, it is not known whether universal one-way hash functions (in the sense of Naor and Yung <ref> [17] </ref>) are sufficient for commitment schemes in the unbounded receiver model. 6 Another open problem is to design efficient commitment schemes which have nice homomorphism properties.
