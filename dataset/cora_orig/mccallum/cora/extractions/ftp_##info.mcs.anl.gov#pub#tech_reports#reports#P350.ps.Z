Reference-contexts: Hence, Fortran M can be used as a general-purpose modular framework for building earth system models on parallel computers <ref> [2] </ref>. 4 Data Parallelism The basic paradigm underlying Fortran M is task parallelism: the parallel execution of (possibly dissimilar) tasks. However, Fortran M also provides some support for data-parallel computation. Programs can use data distribution statements to create distributed arrays. Semantically, distributed arrays are indistinguishable from nondistributed arrays.
