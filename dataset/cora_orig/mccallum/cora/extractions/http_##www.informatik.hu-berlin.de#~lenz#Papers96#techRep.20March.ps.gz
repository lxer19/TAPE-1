Reference-contexts: For CBR the same solutions might be desirable, i.e. finding a case because of its components some of which may have been mentioned in the query case (cf. the ideas of hooks attached to cases according to the case descriptions in <ref> (Aamodt, 1990, p.57) </ref>). This is true at least for those applications where similar cases have a similar description (whereas in analogical reasoning this approach is probably not sufficient due to the comparison of episodes stemming from completely different domains).

Reference-contexts: Hence a major problem to be solved for CBR systems is the retrieval 1 of relevant cases. While the retrieval phase in the Aamodt & Plaza model <ref> (Aamodt and Plaza, 1994) </ref> consists of (a) identifying features (b) searching for relevant cases (c) initially matching cases against the new problem and (d) selecting the best case from the case base we restrict the meaning of retrieval to mainly tasks (b) and (c).

Reference-contexts: This is closely related to the interpretation of case retrieval as case completion as discussed in Section 2.2. A good diagnosis tool should guide this process (as in MOLTKE <ref> (Althoff and We, 1991) </ref>). 4. Special facts in case descriptions (e.g. engine defect) may be considered in some contexts as part of a problem description, while they may serve as the solution in other contexts. 5.

Reference-contexts: In order to fulfill the above goals, we will combine ideas from the theory of Semantic Networks (Quillian, 1988), from spreading activation approaches <ref> (Anderson, 1988) </ref>, from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs, (Rumelhart et al., 1986)), and (of course) from Case Based Reasoning (CBR) (Kolodner, 1993; We, 1995). By combining techniques from these areas with new methods we 1 This chapter is an extended version of (Burkhard and Lenz, 1996). 8 2.2. <p> In this sense, it is related to the model discussed as content addressable memory at the rebirth of Artificial Neural Networks in (Rumelhart et al., 1986). From this origins, it is connected to predecessors in Semantic Networks (Quillian, 1988) and to the methods of Spreading Activation <ref> (Anderson, 1988) </ref>. It is also related to Dynamic Memory (Kolodner, 1993) and to discrimination networks (Kolodner, 1993) used in CBR, but both approaches are organized as trees and support merely a top-down search procedure. <p> similarity not in a separate thesaurus but as binary relations between predicates (or arcs in the net) | this already appears to be very similar to the initial ideas of Case Retrieval Nets. 9.3 Spreading Activation Theories 9.3.1 Act* Very briefly, the main points of the Act* learning theory by <ref> (Anderson, 1988) </ref> are twofold: Firstly, the architecture consists of three different memories: a declarative, a procedural, and the working memory.

Reference-contexts: of more traditional techniques and enables us to construct other CRN models which then can be proved to be equivalent in some sense to BCRNs. 4.2 Spreading Activation Nets In this section, an extension of BCRNs will be introduced which further explores the concept of spreading activation as introduced by <ref> (Anderson, 1989) </ref>. As with CCRNs, a major goal of this approach is to decrease the number of specified edges within the net of IEs, i.e. to avoid that the similarity function needs to be explicitly given for all pairs of IEs. <p> Secondly, the inference process heavily relys on a spreading activation (SA) process in the working memory, that is: ": : : memories can be brought back into working memory by a spreading activation process by which associated concepts retrieve : : : facts." <ref> (Anderson, 1989) </ref> In CRNs, too, we have the distinction between various types of knowledge: The nodes of the net containing IEs and cases (E [C) make up the declarative part, while the knowledge encoded in the similarity function describes how the inference process utilizes the net (procedural knowledge). 9.3.

Reference-contexts: POTENTIALS FOR HUGE CASE BASES: CRNS AND DATABASES 59 6.3 Potentials for huge case bases: CRNs and databases A major shortcoming of experiments with academic CBR systems up to now is that most often only fairly small case bases are considered. In <ref> (Auriol et al., 1994) </ref>, for example, the Travel Agency application of Section 7.1 was by far the largest. Other experiments included applications with at most a few hundred cases only.

Reference-contexts: Other lines are related to more complicated (long time) reasoning processes (where CBR may play a role for argumentation). This leads to the picture of cognitive skills at different levels as suggested by <ref> (Brooks, 1991) </ref> and (Minsky, 1986) (while the implementation and the background of extended CRNs is quite different). Parallel work on different layers at the same time is possible.

Reference-contexts: Basically, there are three major conditions to be met: efficiency, completeness, and flexibility (cf. also (We, 1995, pp.193) and <ref> (Brown, 1994a, p.5) </ref>): Efficiency concerns the effort required to access relevant cases. Access of these cases should avoid exhaustive search in memory. <p> Activating the nodes in memory corresponding to the query case (here: seed nodes) 2. Propagating activation through the network encoding domain (or world) knowledge (see below) 3. Propagating activation to nodes associated to stored cases Or, as <ref> (Brown, 1994a, p. 16) </ref> describes it: ": : : assume a certain knowledge item is associated with a case as one of its features. <p> Instead of Major shortcomings of Crash are probably that the employed world knowledge has to be acquired somehow, and that it may grow rapidly for real-world applications (this can already be observed in the figures describing quite simple episodes, e.g. <ref> (Brown, 1994a, p.34f.) </ref>). Hence the question of scalability arises | and the reported tests with case bases containing 8, 13, and 22 cases in a toy domain do not really support the claim of scalability. Compared to this, CRNs have been applied successfully to huge case bases (cf. Chapter 6).

Reference-contexts: In the formal framework, CRNs show some similarities to theories and models developed within the cognitive science community, such as * inference by spread of activation as described by (Anderson, 1983; Anderson, 1989; Anderson, 1988) or <ref> (Collins and F, 1988) </ref>; * knowledge representation using semantic networks based on (Quillian, 1988); * the parallel distributed processing (PDP) framework (Rumelhart et al., 1986; McClelland et al., 1986); * computation locally in nodes as in structured recurrent Neural Networks, cf. e.g. (Dyer et al., 1992; Harnad, 1992; Honavar, 1995; Hopfield,

Reference-contexts: Due to this restriction, BCRNs have basically the same drawbacks as Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) models (Rumelhart et al., 1986), namely that they can hardly represent sequential thought processes adequately (cf. <ref> (Davies, 1992) </ref> for a discussion). Ahigh level reasoning strategy may sometimes be desirable allowing, e.g., for the integration of rules expressing causal dependencies underlying the domain.

Reference-contexts: Search procedures themselves are related to problem solving attempts controlled by higher cognitive layers, which supervise the lower layer activities, e.g. for choosing a good alternative. Argumentation (instead of exhaustive search for further candidates) seems to be more typical in human problem solving (cf. <ref> (Enzinger et al., 1994) </ref>). The arguments are retrieved on lower levels (just like cases in CRNs), and may again compete for fitting the competition problem. <p> Section 4.2). The shortcuts may also have some drawbacks as far as other competing processes are pruned (because of their longer computation times). For humans, this is a source to be manipulated (politics are an example). Moreover, experts tend to fail when problems are represented in unusual terms <ref> (Enzinger et al., 1994) </ref>. This means for artificial CBR systems that humans should always criticize the output of the systems. The cognitive adequacy in CBR implies the adequacy to human cognitive errors, too. Advantages of CRNs for case retrieval have been listed in Section 2.6.

Morgan Kaufman. </publisher>
Reference-contexts: In particular, query processing strategies to increase efficiency heavily rely on this feature. In contrast to these database models some approaches have been developed to allow for expressing imprecise data and answering vague queries. A probabilistic framework, for example, has been introduced in <ref> (Fuhr, 1990) </ref>. In this approach, each query to a database system consists of a boolean part (as traditionally) and a vague part.

Reference-contexts: To find a similar situation in analogy, some structural relationships are searched for which can be observed in both, the current problem situation and a stored past situation <ref> (Gentner, 1983) </ref>. Very often this kind of analogy is applied across domains.

Reference-contexts: The investigation of SANs (4.2) shows the problems with spreading activation. The CRN model allows for further extensions e.g. by nodes for higher concepts (cf. Chapter 4). This permits further spreading activations following conceptual hierarchies (as used for structural analogy <ref> (Gentner, 1990) </ref>). Sub-symbolic reasoning by NNs can be integrated, too (since related formalisms are used). Thus, CRNs may be useful as a bridge between different approaches in AI, which makes them again interesting for cognitive modeling.

Reference-contexts: Here a much more sophisticated match procedure is usually applied than in (c). This distinction follows the Mac/Fac model of <ref> (Gentner and Forbus, 1991) </ref>. To support efficient retrieval of cases relevant in specific problem situations, the framework of Case Retrieval Nets is presented in this report. <p> Rather, the main task of this process is to present data stored in memory which is relevant to the current problem situation. The detailed assessment of these cases is then delegated to a later stage, as in the Mac/Fac model of <ref> (Gentner and Forbus, 1991) </ref>, or even to the (human) expert. Summarizing, we obtain the following interpretation of cases, the case base and case retrieval: A case base is an external memory while retrieving relevant cases corresponds to re membering past experiences.

Reference-contexts: This allows for a comparison with other methods, too, as some overview articles exist that investigate previously published approaches on the basis of a linear search, as e.g., <ref> (Goos, 1994) </ref>. Generally, data from the Travel Agency domain (Lenz, 1994a; Lenz, 1994b) and from some others contained in the UCI Repository of Machine Learning Databases (Murphy and Aha, 1992) have been selected to perform the tests. <p> Most notable, the speed-up of CRN-retrieval compared to linear retrieval is much higher than reported for other techniques (cf. <ref> (Goos, 1994) </ref>). <p> In the following we will briefly compare the ideas of CRNs to some of the major approaches to case retrieval. A more detailed comparison of these techniques, including analysis of complexity and performance benchmarks, can be found in <ref> (Goos, 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: However, it seems even more reasonable to adjust initially predefined weights (rules of thumb) instead of learning these from scratch. By doing so, the grounding problem of symbolic AI systems <ref> (Harnad, 1992) </ref> could (partially) be overcome, as it is the human user who initially gives meaning to the symbols and the system which adapts the meaning according to the observations in the domain: The systems only fine-tunes the net. 50 CHAPTER 4.

Reference-contexts: This contradicts Principle 1. Also, the notion of similarity (Principle 5) is not utilized. * Hierarchical memory structures, such as shared feature networks or discrimination networks <ref> (Kolodner, 1993) </ref>, come closest to the ideal retrieval procedure as expressed in the above principles. However, they limit the flexibility of information retrieval as they pre-determine the order in which the descriptions have to be entered. <p> C. * Distance functions can be computed in the same way (where the preferences correspond to decreasing distances). * Variations of the query activation ff query permit a finer tuning of queries. * Retrieval is performed bottom-up (other CBR techniques, e.g. those inspired be nearest neighbor approaches and discrimination networks <ref> (Kolodner, 1993) </ref>, use a top-down strat egy). * The complexity of retrieval may be extremely low if activations concern only a small number of nodes (if the net has not too many non-zero connections). <p> From this origins, it is connected to predecessors in Semantic Networks (Quillian, 1988) and to the methods of Spreading Activation (Anderson, 1988). It is also related to Dynamic Memory <ref> (Kolodner, 1993) </ref> and to discrimination networks (Kolodner, 1993) used in CBR, but both approaches are organized as trees and support merely a top-down search procedure. <p> From this origins, it is connected to predecessors in Semantic Networks (Quillian, 1988) and to the methods of Spreading Activation (Anderson, 1988).

Furthermore, these techniques can hardly be evaluated in terms of formal properties. 9.1.4 Hierarchical memory structures Hierarchical approaches, such as discrimination networks or shared feature networks <ref> (Kolodner, 1993, pp. 295) </ref> are used to reduce the search space compared to linear search by storing the case base in a tree-oriented memory structure.

Reference-contexts: This is realistic e.g. for translations from well-defined similarity functions. Case based systems with attribute vectors often use a similarity measure which is computed as the weighted sum of attribute similarities ("composite similarities"). Such similarities can be easily implemented by special BCRNs (cf. Chapter 5). As experiments show (cf. <ref> (Lenz, 1996a) </ref> and Chapter 6), the implementation of case retrieval using CRNs is efficient. Moreover, (B)CRNs offer possibilities of extensions in various ways (cf. Chapter 4). <p> The CPU time required for linear retrieval was defined to be 100%.

These do support a better presentation of multimedia information and can be enhanced with search utilities in the meaning of CaBaTa.

By combining techniques from these areas with new methods we 1 This chapter is an extended version of (Burkhard and Lenz, 1996). 8 2.2. <p> Due to this restriction, BCRNs have basically the same drawbacks as Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) models <ref> (Rumelhart et al., 1986) </ref>, namely that they can hardly represent sequential thought processes adequately (cf. (Davies, 1992) for a discussion). Ahigh level reasoning strategy may sometimes be desirable allowing, e.g., for the integration of rules expressing causal dependencies underlying the domain. <p> Section 4.4 will show how this can be integrated into the BCRN model. * Similarly to the hidden nodes in Artificial Neural Networks, microfeatures might be desirable which (in a distributed representation, cf. <ref> (Rumelhart et al., 1986) </ref>) encode properties of sets of IEs and thus allow for a memory-efficient computation of similarity between these. This idea will be considered in Section 4.5 about Microfeatures Case Retrieval Nets (MFCRNs). <p> This procedure is widely used in Hopfield nets (Hopfield, 1982). A similar approach, which however is more intuitive for our purposes, is the application of Harmony Theory, as introduced by Smolensky in <ref> (Rumelhart et al., 1986, Chapter 6) </ref>: The idea is to define a harmony function H which expresses to which degree the constraints expressed by knowledge about the domain and in the current input are satisfied: "Assembly of schemata : : : and inference : : : are both achieved by finding <p> H which expresses to which degree the constraints expressed by knowledge about the domain and in the current input are satisfied: "Assembly of schemata : : : and inference : : : are both achieved by finding maximally self-consistent states of the system that are also consistent with the input" <ref> (Rumelhart et al., 1986, p. 207) </ref>. The dynamic of the system is quite similar to the methods proposed by Hopfield: Using an asynchronous update, each node will take an activation value such that H is increased, or at least not decreased. 4.3. <p> This is a fairly simple extension of the formal model of MFRCNs. A more detailed description of this approach, including formal requirements, can be found in (Rumelhart and Zipser, 1990) and <ref> (Rumelhart et al., 1986, Chapter 5) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In the following we will give the English versions of one set of stories from <ref> (Thagard et al., 1990) </ref>: Base Story Karla, an old hawk, lived at the top of a tall oak tree. One afternoon, she saw a hunter on the ground with a bow and some crude arrows that had no feathers. The hunter took aim and shot at the hawk but missed. <p> As it capitulated the crippled government of Zerdia realized that the attacker's missiles had been guided by Zerdian supercomputers. As we do not really want to perform complex analogical reasoning processes, but rather retrieve the best case from this small case base, we limited the representation formalism compared to <ref> (Thagard et al., 1990) </ref> and considered each episode as a single case. The structure of these cases are shown in Figure 7.2. As a processing strategy an approach similar to the utilization of a Harmony function has been used (cf. <p> In fact, the net as shown in Figure 7.3 was not given to the system a priori. Similarly to the construction of an analogy network constructed by ARCS <ref> (Thagard et al., 1990) </ref>, the network was built up successively as a result of the retrieval process. <p> An interesting approach to analog retrieval, which also relies on a net structure representing the problem situations, has been described by <ref> (Thagard et al., 1990) </ref>: The Arcs system utilizes some background knowledge about similar relations to subsequently construct a net structure useful for accessing situations in memory which have several kinds of correspondences with the structure of the problem situation. <p> Both techniques, Arcs and CRNs, use a bottom-up approach to avoid search in the traditional AI sense in order to access relevant situations stored in memory | or , as <ref> (Thagard et al., 1990, p. 281) </ref> describe it: "It is important to be clear about what Arcs is not doing: It does not compare the probe with every structure in memory, but considers only those that have semantically 92 CHAPTER 9.

While the CR, just like the SMC, is also based on counting matching and different features, the application of it is not restricted to binary features only.

Reference-contexts: Basically, there are three major conditions to be met: efficiency, completeness, and flexibility (cf. also <ref> (We, 1995, pp.193) </ref> and (Brown, 1994a, p.5)): Efficiency concerns the effort required to access relevant cases. Access of these cases should avoid exhaustive search in memory. <p> In general, these conditions express contradictory goals: Most techniques for pre-structuring the case memory increase efficiency but limit the flexibility. Concerning the discrepancy between efficiency and completeness we will, following <ref> (We, 1995, p. 168) </ref>, use the following types of errors to characterize retrieval techniques: ff-error: Cases sufficiently similar to the query case are not retrieved, i.e. are being discarded during the selection of relevant cases. fi-error: Cases sufficiently dissimilar to the query case are retrieved. <p> Formally, in step /* ~ A */ of Listing 2.2 a threshold " &gt; 0 is inserted implying that only sufficiently similar IEs will be taken into account. This method has close relationships to relational retrieval as considered by <ref> (We, 1995, pp. 165) </ref>. <p> On the other hand, cases having 0.2 similarity concerning all attributes, i.e. having also a global similarity of only 0.2, are retrieved. This shows that the idea of placing a hypercube covering the hyper-ball is insufficient in the n-dimensional case. As explained in <ref> (We, 1995) </ref>, too, a discrepancy between the ff-error (discarding of sufficiently similar cases) and the fi-error (retrieval of dissimilar cases) can be observed: If the goal is to retrieve all cases within the white circle, the white square results in a high ff-error whereas retrieval of the grey area results in <p> Hence, they provide only limited flexibility (cf. also (Waltz, 1989; Thagard and Holyoak, 1989) for a discussion on the cognitive adequacy of indexing). 9.1.3 Relational retrieval In particular for the integration of CBR systems with databases, relational retrieval <ref> (We, 1995, pp. 165) </ref> has been designed. Given a query, a set of possible alternatives is computed and a suitable query is posed to the database system. Similarly to indexing approaches, the set of possible alternatives has to be specified a priori, i.e. before the query is known.

Reference-contexts: Major disadvantages of marker passing algorithms are that (a) the search in the network is rather undirected: in some empirical studies about 90% of all the investigated paths yield a dead end because the spreading activation process essentially performs a blind search (cf. <ref> (Wolverton, 1995) </ref> for a discussion); (b) the decision of whether to pass a marker is strictly yes or no: there is no means of expressing a certain degree of membership to a concept. <p> Based on the degree of usefulness determined by this mapping component, some ": : : search control module modifies the direction of subsequent spreads of activation into more promising areas of the knowledge base." <ref> (Wolverton, 1995) </ref> As expected, theoretical investigations as well as empirical tests proved that KDSA is superior to SA. As pointed out, however, KDSA has been designed mainly for cross-domain analogies where the goal is to retrieve ": : : semantically distant analogies".
