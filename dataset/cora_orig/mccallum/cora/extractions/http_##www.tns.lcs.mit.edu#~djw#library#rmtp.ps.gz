Abstract: This paper describes the design and implementation of a multi-cast transport protocol called RMTP. RMTP provides sequenced, lossless delivery of bulk data from one sender to a group of receivers. RMTP achieves reliability by using a packet based selective repeat retransmission scheme, in which each acknowledgment (ACK) packet carries a sequence number and a bitmap. ACK handling is based on a multi-level hierarchical approach, in which the receivers are grouped into a hierarchy of local regions, with a Designated Receiver (DR) in each local region. Receivers in each local region periodically send ACKs to their corresponding DR, DRs send ACKs to the higher-level DRs, until the DRs in the highest level send ACKs to the sender, thereby avoiding the ACK-implosion problem. DRs cache received data and respond to retransmission requests of the receivers in their corresponding local regions, thereby decreasing end-to-end latency and improving resource usage. This paper also provides the measurements of RMTP's performance with receivers located at various sites in the Internet.

The scheme used in RMTP for detecting congestion is described below. RMTP uses retransmission requests from receivers as an indication of possible network congestion [6, 5].

Reference-contexts: A protocol process uses a configuration file to learn about the location of the umrouted that handles its multicasting requests. When a protocol process wishes to join a multicast group, it sends an Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) <ref> [3] </ref> Host Membership Report packet via UDP to its umrouted. The Host Membership Report message requires an acknowledgment from the umrouted. Thus, a umrouted builds a list of protocol processes' host addresses that it handles.

The goal of this paper is to describe the design and implementation of a reliable multicast transport protocol for wide area networks. Called RMTP, the protocol provides sequenced, loss-less delivery of bulk data from a sender to a group of receivers.

The basic ideas of RMTP are derived from the Designated Status Protocol (DSP) described in <ref> [16] </ref>.

In order to avoid this situation, RMTP uses Designated Receivers (DRs) <ref> [16] </ref>. The DRs assist the sender in processing ACKs and in retransmitting data. The concept of using DRs is best illustrated by Figures 2 and 3. Figure 2 shows a multicast tree with 14 receivers and a sender.

Reference-contexts: We modified mrouted to incorporate the routing functions of a multicast kernel. (We refer to the modified mrouted as umrouted.) Communications among umrouteds are via User Datagram Protocol (UDP) <ref> [17] </ref>. Thus, multicast packets travel on UDP-tunnels among umrouteds. By executing umrouted, a host with unicast kernel becomes a user level multicast router. A user-level protocol process implements the RMTP protocol. Application-level receivers and senders use UDP to communicate with the RMTP protocol process.

Reference-contexts: For such applications, a separate TCP <ref> [19] </ref> connection can be established between the sender and each receiver, delivering every packet individually to each receiver. However, such a scheme is very inefficient because every packet needs to be duplicated as many times as the number of receivers.
