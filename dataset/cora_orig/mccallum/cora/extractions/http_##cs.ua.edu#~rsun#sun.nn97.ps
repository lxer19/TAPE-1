Reference-contexts: Moreover, different types of learning processes are involved in acquiring different types of knowledge <ref> (Anderson 1983, Keil 1989, Smolensky 1988, Stanley et al 1989) </ref>. Humans are able to learn procedural knowledge through trial and error (without a priori knowledge) in the aforementioned tasks.

Reference-contexts: This is true in both an ontological and an ontogenetic sense. Note that, though access consciousness has a clear causal role in behavior (as discussed earlier), phenomenal consciousness is less clear in this regard <ref> (Block 1994) </ref>. Functionalism. An important question concerning consciousness is whether there is a physical basis for consciousness and what it is. It is pretty much agreed upon among contemporary philosophers that there is indeed a physical basis but they disagree on what constitutes that physical basis.

Reference-contexts: In high-level skill acquisition, Gick and Holyoak (1980) found that good problem solvers could better state rules that described their actions in problem solving. This phenomenon may be related to the self-explanation effect <ref> (Chi et al 1989) </ref>: Subjects who explained the examples in textbooks more completely did better in solving new problems. In all these cases, it may well be the explication and the use of explicit knowledge that helped the performance.

Reference-contexts: There also has been some work in neural network and machine learning communities in developing modular systems, which are equally relevant. On the other hand, declarative knowledge can be captured by a symbolic or a "localist" representation <ref> (Clark and Karmiloff-Smith 1993) </ref>, in which each unit has a clear conceptual meaning or interpretation. This allows declarative knowledge to be highly accessible and inferences to be performed explicitly (Smolensky 1988, Sun 1994). Declarative knowledge can be learned in a variety of ways. <p> To facilitate correspondence with the bottom level and to encourage uniformity and integration <ref> (Clark and Karmiloff-Smith 1993) </ref>, we chose to use a localist network model for representing these rules. Basically, we connect the nodes representing conditions of a rule to the node representing the conclusion. However, we need to determine how we wire up a rule involving conjunctive conditions. <p> Keil (1989) pointed out that it was unlikely that "theories" developed independently, but rather they developed somehow from associative information that was already available. These findings further testify to the ubiquity of an implicit-to-explicit transition <ref> (Clark and Karmiloff-Smith 1993) </ref>. Clarion readily captures this kind of bottom-up process. The bottom level develops implicit, embodied skills on its own (section 2, Eq.2), while the top level extracts explicit rules using algorithm Rule-Extraction-Refinement (section 2). <p> This is in contrast with the notion of "thematic" consciousness, which involves a focused, mediated awareness of the object of consciousness (akin to the common notion of consciousness). Thematic consciousness is representational because it treats awareness itself as an object <ref> (see also Clark and Karmiloff-Smith 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: These models capture to varying extents experimental findings and pretheoretical intuitions about consciousness (see, e.g., Taylor 1994, Schacter 1990, Jackendoff 1987, Shallice 1988, Baars 1988, Dennett and Kinsbourne 1992, Penrose 1994). Unfortunately, however, some of these models <ref> (such as Dennett and Kinsbourne 1992, Shallice 1988, Jackendoff 1987) </ref> are aimed at a very high and gross level of explanation (e.g., overall architectures) and thus unable to provide more detailed predictions and explanations.

Reference-contexts: Human intuition. While the top level of Clarion captures conscious processes, the bottom level may capture intuition to some extent (as a form of skill): This level has the characteristics of being implicit, inaccessible, and holistic, which are also characteristics of human intuition <ref> (James 1890, Dreyfus and Dreyfus 1987) </ref>. According to Smolensky (1988), as mentioned before, intuition and skill are not expressible in linguistic forms and constitute a different kind of capacity, reflecting "subsymbolic" processing.

Reference-contexts: Everyday routine activities are mostly made up of non-deliberate "primordial" coping. For example, in normal perception, we are usually not having thematic experience of the world (or being actively aware of our perception), but are "drawn into" the spectacle of the world <ref> (Dreyfus 1992) </ref>. An agent's "openness onto the world" is fundamental and makes possible the secondary experience of deliberate looking or trying to see (Dreyfus 1992). Comportment is prior to any (explicit) belief, (explicit) knowledge, or (explicit) representation; it is a direct connection between an agent and its existential context. <p> perception, we are usually not having thematic experience of the world (or being actively aware of our perception), but are "drawn into" the spectacle of the world <ref> (Dreyfus 1992) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This coincides with the well-known modularity claim <ref> (Fodor 1983, Karmiloff-Smith 1986, Cosmides and Tooby 1994) </ref>, in that much processing in the human mind is done by limited, encapsulated (to some extent), specialized processors that are highly efficient. It is also similar to Shallice (1988)'s idea of a multitude of "action systems" competing with each other.

Reference-contexts: This approach is also interactionism in the sense that the interaction of internal and external systems (the agent and its world), on the basis of internal (developing) fine-grained functional organizations, is crucial in giving rise to conscious experience <ref> (Heidegger 1927) </ref>. 5 Comparisons The following comparisons will further explicate and accentuate the Clarion model in accounting for issues of consciousness. Clarion captures important features of existing models.

Reference-contexts: A pattern emerging from the human data is that, if the to-be-learned relationships are simple, usually explicit/conscious learning prevails, while when more complex relationships are involved, implicit/unconscious learning becomes more prominent. The implicit learning mechanism appears to be more structurally sophisticated and able to handle more difficult situations <ref> (Lewicki et al 1992) </ref>. It is important to note the inability of human subjects to articulate their implicitly learned knowledge, no matter how hard they tried (this is especially true in Lewicki 1992). The subjects were often not even aware of the fact that they were learning. <p> The implicit learning mechanism appears to be more structurally sophisticated and able to handle more difficult situations (Lewicki et al 1992).

This accords well with the Clarion model.

Reference-contexts: This learning process performs both structural credit assignment and temporal credit assignment. 3 In terms of both simplicity and performance, Q-learning is the best among similar reinforcement learning methods <ref> (Lin 1992, Sun et al 1995) </ref>. 4 The training of the backpropagation network is based on minimizing the following: err i = r + fle (y) Q (x; a) if a i = a 0 otherwise (4) where i is the index for an output node representing the action a i

Reference-contexts: One difference is that Clarion does not emphasize as much internal consistency <ref> (Marcel 1983) </ref>: it is believed to be limited as a phenomenon in consciousness and may have only limited roles in the emergence of consciousness. <p> role of reverberation (Damasio 1994, Taylor 1994) may be captured in Clarion through using recurrent connections within modules at the bottom level and through multiple top-down and bottom-up information flows across the two levels, which lead to the unity of consciousness that is the synthesis of all the information present <ref> (Marcel 1983, Baars 1988) </ref>. 6 CONCLUDING REMARKS 23 6 Concluding remarks This paper presented a hybrid neural network model for learning that incorporated the distinction of declarative and procedural knowledge, and succeeded to some extent in accounting for the distinction of the conscious and the unconscious (or the explicit and the

Reference-contexts: In this approach, a particular kind of phenomenal quality may be accounted for by a particular region of a total-state space (involving the totality of all the aforementioned aspects), or the "manifold" as termed by Van Gulick (1993), which gives rise to the sense of what something is like <ref> (Nagel 1974) </ref>. Clearly, such regions depend on particular functional organizations of modules and levels (Chalmers 1992) that support such a space of total-states. Qualia are thus (partially) the result of functional organizations (architectures) of cognitive apparatuses.

Reference-contexts: In another instance, subjects were to interact with a computer simulated "person" and to maintain the behavior of the "person" at "very friendly" by manipulating his/her own behavior. In artificial grammar learning <ref> (Reber 1989) </ref>, subjects were presented strings of letters that were generated in accordance with a simple grammar. Although subjects were unaware of the underlying grammars, they were asked to judge the grammaticality of novel strings. <p> Furthermore, in general, the bottom level is used to tackle more complex relations while the top level takes on simpler and crisper relations <ref> (cf. Reber 1989, Seger 1994) </ref>. This is because the top level does not lend itself easily to the learning of complex structures due to its crisp, individuated, and symbolic representation and rigorous learning process. <p> has the capability to capture the generalization exhibited in human implicit learning. (Explicit processes, as in the top level of Clarion, can also generalize, albeit in a different way as discussed in Sun et al 1995.) It has also been observed that implicit processes are more robust than explicit processes <ref> (Reber 1989) </ref> in the face of internal disorder and malfunctioning. For example, Hasher and Zacks (1979) found that encoding of frequency information (an implicit process) was correctly performed by clinically depressed patients, even though they could not perform explicit tasks consciously. <p> Intuition is the end product of this process of unconscious and bottom-up learning <ref> (Reber 1989) </ref>. Bowers et al (1990) also suggested that intuition is the outcome of a continuous implicit process (which later becomes explicit due to the emergence of a coherent pattern of activation) in the context of discovery.

Reference-contexts: the circumstances in which a high level of statistical structure is involved in sequences, the bottom level prevails. 3 PSYCHOLOGICAL DATA AND THE MODEL 12 Note that there has been other work that demonstrated the distinction and dissociation of the two types of knowledge and proposed models based on that <ref> (e.g., Schacter 1990, Shallice 1988) </ref>. However, some of the empirical work on which these models are based is concerned with abnormal subjects, most typically patients with brain damages.

Reference-contexts: Although the model was, I believe, on the right track, the support for it was not as strong as it could have been, because in brain damaged patients, it was possible that certain reconfiguration and reallocation might have taken place <ref> (Shallice 1988) </ref> and thus rendered the findings less applicable to normal human subjects.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, skills, intuition, and the like are not expressible in linguistic forms and do not conform to the three criteria prescribed. Hence, skills and intuition constitute a different kind of capacity, reflecting "subsymbolic" processing at the subconceptual level <ref> (see also Shiffrin and Schnei-der 1977) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, declarative knowledge can be captured by a symbolic or a "localist" representation (Clark and Karmiloff-Smith 1993), in which each unit has a clear conceptual meaning or interpretation. This allows declarative knowledge to be highly accessible and inferences to be performed explicitly <ref> (Smolensky 1988, Sun 1994) </ref>. Declarative knowledge can be learned in a variety of ways. <p> Specifically, the bottom level captures the implicit and routine activities and embodies "comportment". This is because the bottom level embodies skills resulting from and used for directly coping with the world and involves distributed representation, which hence is unable to present explicit traces of its processes <ref> (Smolensky 1988) </ref>. However, some events (e.g., certain implicit processes or explicit verbal inputs; Velmans 1983) may lead to activation of corresponding explicit representation and processes at the top level and therefore lead to (thematic) conscious awareness.

Reference-contexts: A specific example of this complexity difference is as follows. Implicit learning of sequences (e.g., artificial grammar sequences) is biased towards sequences with a high level of statistical structure with much correlation <ref> (Stadler 1992) </ref>. As has been demonstrated by Elman (1990) and by Cleeremans and McClelland (1991), recurrent backpropagation networks, as used in the bottom level of Clarion (in conjunction with Q-learning), can handle sequences with complex statistical structures, given proper training procedures.

Reference-contexts: Humans are able to learn procedural knowledge through trial and error (without a priori knowledge) in the aforementioned tasks. On top of low-level procedural skills, declarative knowledge can be acquired also through on-going experience in the world <ref> (see Stanley et al 1989) </ref>. Furthermore, it is important for declarative knowledge to be learned through the mediation of low-level skills (i.e., bottom-up learning; see Sun et al 1996a). Procedural knowledge (skills) can be captured by a "subsymbolic" distributed representation, such as that provided by a backpropagation network. <p> In this work, I only examine experimental findings from normal subjects and thus results obtained may be generalized to a wider range of settings. 3.2 Delayed explication of unconscious processes In the implicit learning literature, implicit performance typically improves earlier than explicit knowledge that can be verbalized by the subject <ref> (Stanley et al 1989) </ref>. For example, in dynamic decision tasks, although performance quickly rises to a high level, subjects' verbal knowledge improves far slower; the subjects cannot provide usable verbal knowledge until near the end of their training (Stanley et al 1989). <p> improves earlier than explicit knowledge that can be verbalized by the subject <ref> (Stanley et al 1989) </ref>. For example, in dynamic decision tasks, although performance quickly rises to a high level, subjects' verbal knowledge improves far slower; the subjects cannot provide usable verbal knowledge until near the end of their training (Stanley et al 1989). Bowers et al (1990) also showed delayed explication of implicit processes. When subjects were given patterns to complete, they showed implicit recognition of what a proper completion might be even though they did not have explicit recognition of a correct completion.

Reference-contexts: Because of the implicit nature of procedural skills, details of such skills are in general inaccessible to consciousness (Anderson 1982, Reber 1989). A distributed representation naturally captures this property with representational units that are capable of accomplishing tasks but are in general uninterpretable and subsymbolic <ref> (Sun 1994) </ref>. (A symbolic representation may be used, but then this would require an artificial assumption that these representations are not accessible, while other similar representations are accessible | such a distinction is arbitrary.) Procedural knowledge can be learned in a couple of different ways. <p> Explicit representations are "derived" from direct comportment with the world. Derived representation and thematic consciousness come into play, e.g., during breakdown in which established routines get disrupted and thus alternative ways are necessary <ref> (see also Sun 1994, chapter 8) </ref>. In the light of the above, the distinction between the two levels in Clarion can be corresponded roughly to the distinction between comportment and thematic consciousness. Specifically, the bottom level captures the implicit and routine activities and embodies "comportment". <p> This is because at the top level explicit/localist representation is used, which makes it possible to articulate the content that is present and trace the processes as they are occurring <ref> (Sun 1994, chapter 2) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We will also link computational models of consciousness to parts of (phenomenological) philosophy that are concerned with consciousness. As we will focus mainly on the learning aspect in consciousness, let us briefly describe the learning settings that we examined <ref> (from Sun et al 1995) </ref>. These settings are more complex than simple categorization/classification and though action-based, involve more than just simple stimulus-response pairing. Psychological experiments involving dynamic decision making or artificial grammars will be discussed. <p> Although subjects were unaware of the underlying grammars, they were asked to judge the grammaticality of novel strings. In addition, two navigation tasks were used for both psychological experiments and computational modeling in our lab <ref> (see Sun et al, 1995, 1996a, b) </ref>. One is maze running, in which from a starting location, a subject has to find a goal location, using only local sensory information.

Reference-contexts: In the case where correct input/output mappings are provided, straight backpropagation can be used on a neural network. Otherwise, reinforcement learning can be used <ref> (Sutton 1990, Watkins 1989) </ref>. This is preferred because there is often no uniquely correct action in the aforementioned tasks, although feedback is usually available. Using reinforcement learning in neural networks, we can measure the goodness of an action through a payoff/reinforcement signal.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, existing computational, especially neural network, models tend to rush directly into complex neural physiological thickets <ref> (Taylor 1994, Edelman 1989) </ref> and thus may lose sight of forests. In addition, most existing models do not deal adequately with one crucial aspect of human consciousness: learning. <p> The widely recognized role of reverberation <ref> (Damasio 1994, Taylor 1994) </ref> may be captured in Clarion through using recurrent connections within modules at the bottom level and through multiple top-down and bottom-up information flows across the two levels, which lead to the unity of consciousness that is the synthesis of all the information present (Marcel 1983, Baars 1988).

Reference-contexts: The aforementioned view is also consistent with voluminous data on the ever-present role of unconscious processes in all kinds of tasks: lexical priming, semantic processing, visual attention, unconscious perception and so on <ref> (as discussed in Velmans 1991, Marcel 1983) </ref>. Velmans (1991) summarized evidence for the existence of implicit (preconscious) analysis of input stimuli, implicit processing of semantic content of word pairs in "shadowing" experiments, and implicit processing of bilingual messages in similar experimental settings.

Reference-contexts: We can choose an action based on Q-values, e.g., by choosing the one that has the maximum Q-value in the current state or by choosing an action probabilistically based on Q-values. To acquire the Q-values, one option is to use the Q-learning algorithm <ref> (Watkins 1989) </ref>, a reinforcement learning algorithm. 2 In the algorithm, Q (x; a) estimates the maximum discounted cumulative reinforcement that the agent will receive from the current state x on: max ( i=0 2 Supervised learning methods can also be applied, when correct mappings of input and output are available. 2
