Reference-contexts: All of this work was done in order to render large bodies of water having no contact with the ground. A few papers had taken into account shoreline and cresting water models: Peachey [8] and Fournier <ref> [1] </ref> simultaneously created images of seashores in 1986 by modeling the movement of explicit waves over the surface of a fluid with additional fog and sea-foam elements.

Reference-contexts: Extending their algorithm will include adding a new variables to account for the changing inclinations of irregularly shaped surface. 4 Implementation 4.1 Path of the Water Droplet The core of the implementation comes from physical research by Janosi and Horvath <ref> [2] </ref> regarding the dynamics of dripping water.

Most recently O'Brien and Hodgins <ref> [3] </ref> presented a system designed to simulate the dynamics of splashing liquids using a deformable mesh of virtual pipes that adjust to the pressure at the water surface.

Reference-contexts: Modeling ocean and other bodies of water effectively began with Max in 1981 [7] with the ground-breaking animation "Carla's Island" for which he used several superimposed 1 sinusoidal waves of low amplitude. This approach was significantly developed by Masten [6] with the use of Fourier Synthesis. Kass and Miller <ref> [4] </ref> took the previous research and added the fluid dynamics component to model shallow water. Similarly, Watt [9] showed how water reflection above and below the surface can be modeled using backward beam tracing.

Reference-contexts: Still, the only research dedicated entirely to modeling dripping water has been presented in 1993 by Kaneda K., Kagawa T. and Yamashita H <ref> [5] </ref>. For the first time, a realistic rendering of a windowshield with transparent rain-drops has been achieved using physical modeling.
