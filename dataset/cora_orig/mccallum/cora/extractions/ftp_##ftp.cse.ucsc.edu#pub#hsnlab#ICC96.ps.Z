Title: Analysis of Source Policy in Rate-Controlled ATM Networks

Abstract: This paper provides an analysis of the source policy behavior in the rate-based congestion control framework being developed by the ATM Forum and derives approximate analytical closed-form expressions to describe the rate-increase process. These approximations are used to analyze the impact of the source algorithm on the TCP slow-start process operating over a rate-controlled ATM network where rate allocation is performed explicitly in the switches. The results show that the increase in TCP congestion window ramp-up time is noticeable when the round-trip delay is small. The results are verified by simulation.

Note that in this section we consider only networks with long-delay paths, where the entire window in every cycle is transmitted before cells from the same window start returning to the source. Later we will derive a sufficient condition for this assumption to hold. <p> Lemma 1: If r in D C and b 2:2=D then, for every cycle i, T (W i ) D. Proof: The proof is omitted due to lack of space. It can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. Note that the condition stated by Lemma 1 is sufficient but not necessary. That is, it is possible for a combination of maximum window size W , RTT delay and initial rate to violate the condition stated by the lemma, yet the method described to be applicable. <p> Therefore, for the case of D = 0 seconds, Eq. (3.2) can be used to provide a lower bound on TCP congestion window ramp up time. It can be found <ref> [8] </ref> that the time T W required to transmit the necessary data in order for the window to ramp up to its maximum size W (which is the time to transmit l = (W 1)C cells) will be T W = &gt; &lt; ln (r in + l b) ln (r
