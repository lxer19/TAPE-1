Reference-contexts: This file is not loaded automatically at start up; you should load it now, using the Load item on the File menu or the load command, to carry out the calculations in this section. As an example, Bates and Watts <ref> [1, A1.3] </ref> describe an experiment on the relation between the velocity of an enzymatic reaction, y, and the substrate concentration, x.

Reference-contexts: Other techniques that have been developed include brushing a scatterplot highlighting points in one plot and seeing where the corresponding points fall in other plots. A considerable amount of research has been done in this area, see for example the discussion in Becker and Cleveland <ref> [4] </ref> and the papers reproduced in Cleveland and McGill [8]. However most of the software developed to date has been developed on specialized hardware, such as the TTY 5620 terminal or Lisp machines.

Reference-contexts: Another approach to examining residuals for possible outliers is to use the Bayesian residual plot proposed by Chaloner and Brant <ref> [7] </ref>, which can be obtained using the message :plot-bayes-residuals. The expression (send bikes2 :plot-bayes-residuals) produces the plot in Figure 16. The bars represent mean 2SD of the posterior distribution of the actual realized errors, based on an improper uniform prior distribution on the regression coefficients.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm is based on the unconstrained minimization system described in Dennis and Schnabel [10]. As an example, Cox and Snell <ref> [9, Example T] </ref> describe data collected on times (in operating hours) between failures of air conditioning units on several aircraft. <p> Let's start with a simple example, a data set used to study the relation between survival time (in weeks) of leukemia patients and white blood cell count recorded for the patients at their entry into the study <ref> [9, Example U] </ref>. The data consists of two groups of patients classified as AG positive and AG negative.

Reference-contexts: This tutorial has borrowed several ideas from Gary Oehlert's MacAnova User's Guide [13]. Many of the on-line help entries have been adopted directly or with minor modifications from the Kyoto Common Lisp System. Most of the examples used in this tutorial have been taken from Devore and Peck <ref> [11] </ref>. Many of the functions added to XLISP-STAT were motivated by similar functions in the S statistical environment [2,3]. The present version of XLISP-STAT, Version 2.0, seems to run fairly comfortably on a Mac II or Mac Plus with 2MB of memory, but is a bit cramped with only 1MB. <p> Devore and Peck <ref> [11, Exercise 2.11] </ref> describe an experiment in which 22 consumers reported the number of times they had purchased a product during the previous 48 week period. <p> in, see what happens and try to explain any differences. 1. (mean (list 1 2 3)) 2. (+ (list 1 2 3) 4) 3. (* (list 1 2 3) (list 4 5 6)) 4. (+ (list 1 2 3) (list 4 5)) 3.2 Summary Statistics and Plots Devore and Peck <ref> [11, page 54, Table 10] </ref> give precipitation levels recorded during the month of March in the Minneapolis - St. Paul area over a 30 year period. <p> It will do so if it is given a list of lists as its argument instead of a single list. As an example, let's use this function to compare serum total cholesterol values for samples of rural and urban Guatemalans (Devore and Peck <ref> [11, page 19, Example 3] </ref>): 14 rural guatemalans. &gt; (def urban (list 184 196 217 284 184 236 189 206 179 170 205 190 204 330 217 242 222 242 249 241)) URBAN &gt; (def rural (list 166 146 144 204 158 143 158 180 223 194 194 175 171 155 <p> Exercises The following exercises involve examples and problems from Devore and Peck <ref> [11] </ref>. The data sets are in files in the folder Data on the XLISP-STAT distribution disk and can be read in using the Load item in the File menu or using the load function (see Section 5.4 below). <p> The file will be loaded and 15 some variables will be defined for you. Loading file car-prices.lsp will define the single variable car-prices. Loading file heating.lsp will define two variables, gas-heat and electric-heat. 6 1. Devore and Peck <ref> [11, page 18, Example 2] </ref> give advertised prices for a sample of 50 used Japanese subcompact cars. Obtain some plots and summary statistics for this data. Experiment with some transformations of the data as well. The data set is called car-prices in the file car-prices.lsp. <p> Experiment with some transformations of the data as well. The data set is called car-prices in the file car-prices.lsp. The prices are given in units of $1000; thus the price 2.39 represents $2390. The data have been sorted by their leading digit. 2. In Exercise 2.40 Devore and Peck <ref> [11] </ref> give heating costs for a sample of apartments heated by gas and a sample of apartments heated by electricity. Obtain plots and summary statistics for these samples separately and look at a parallel box plot for the two samples. <p> Scatterplots are of course particularly useful for examining the relationship between two numerical observations taken on the same subject. Devore and Peck <ref> [11, Exercise 2.33] </ref> give data for HC and CO emission recorded for 46 automobiles. <p> Draw a graph of the function f (x) = 2x + x 2 between -2 and 3. 2. Devore and Peck <ref> [11, Exercise 4.2] </ref> give the age and CPK concentration, a measure of metabolic activity, recorded for 18 cross country skiers during a relay race. These data are in the variables age and cpk in the file metabolism.lsp. <p> The spin-plot function allows you to construct a rotatable three dimensional plot. As an example let's look a some data collected to examine the relationship between a phosphate absorption index and the amount of extractable iron and aluminum in a sediment (Devore and Peck <ref> [11, page 509, Example 6] </ref>). <p> 48.0 25.6 10.0 16.0 16.8 20.7 38.8 16.9 27.0 16.0 24.9 7.3 12.8)) (def depth (list 8.9 36.6 36.8 6.1 6.9 6.9 7.3 8.4 6.5 8.0 4.5 9.9 2.9 2.0)) (def water (list 31.5 27.0 25.9 39.1 39.2 38.3 33.9 33.8 27.9 33.1 26.3 37.8 34.6 36.4)) (Devore and Peck <ref> [11, Problem 12.18] </ref>) the expression (spin-plot (list water depth strength) :variable-labels (list "Water" "Depth" "Strength")) produces a plot that can be rotated to produce the view in Figure 8. <p> These data concern samples of thawed permafrost soil. strength is the shear strength, and water is the percentage water content. depth is the depth at which the sample was taken. The plot shows that a linear model will not fit well. Devore and Peck <ref> [11] </ref> suggest fitting a model with quadratic terms to this data. 30 X Z Pitch Roll Yaw X Pitch Roll Yaw absorption in sediment samples.

In the plot in Figure 11 a long, thin brush has been used to highlight the points in the third variety. <p> Like spin-plot, the function scatterplot-matrix also accepts the optional keyword argument scale. Exercises 1. Devore and Peck <ref> [11, Exercise 13.62] </ref> describe an experiment to determine the effect of oxygen concentration on fermentation end products. Four oxygen concentrations and two types of sugar were used. <p> As an example, Devore and Peck <ref> [11, page 105, Example 2] </ref> describe a data set collected to examine the effect of bicycle lanes on drivers and bicyclists.

The initial guess can consist of a simplex, a list of n + 1 points for an n-dimensional problem, or it can be a single point, represented by a list or vector of n numbers.

These functions are listed in the appendix as well.

Reference-contexts: XLISP also contains some extensions to Lisp to support object-oriented programming. These facilities have been modified in XLISP-STAT to implement the screen menus, plots and regression models. Several excellent books on Common Lisp are available. One example is Winston and Horn <ref> [22] </ref>. A book on XLISP itself has recently been published. Unfortunately it is based on XLISP 1.7, which differs significantly from XLISP 2.0, the basis of XLISP-STAT 2.0. XLISP-STAT was originally developed for the Apple Macintosh.
