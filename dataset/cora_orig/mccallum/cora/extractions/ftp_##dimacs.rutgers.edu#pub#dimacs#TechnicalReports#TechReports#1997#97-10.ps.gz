Several constructions of masking quorum systems were given in [MR97] for a variety of failure models. For the model we consider here|i.e., any b servers may experience Byzan-tine failures|that work gave two constructions. The properties of these constructions are included in the preceding table for comparison with our results. <p> We are able to prove this behavior of F p using results from Percolation theory [Kes82, Gri89]. - 13 - Remark: The system we present here is based on a triangular lattice, with elements corresponding to vertices, as in <ref> [WB92, Baz96] </ref>. We have also constructed a second system which is based on the square lattice with elements corresponding to the edges, as in [NW94]. The properties of this second system are almost identical to those of M-Path, so we omit it. Proposition 7.1 Let b = (k 2 1)=2.

Reference-contexts: The resiliency f of a quorum system provides one measure of how many crash failures a - 5 - quorum system is guaranteed to survive, and indeed this measure has been used in the past to differentiate among quorum systems <ref> [BG86] </ref>. However, it is possible that an f-resilient quorum system, though vulnerable to a few failure configurations of f +1 failures, can survive many configurations of more than f failures.

Reference-contexts: We would like F p to be as small as possible. A desirable asymptotic behavior of F p is that F p ! 0 when n ! 1 for all p &lt; 1=2, and such an F p is called Condorcet (after the Condorcet Jury Theorem <ref> [Con] </ref>). 4 Building Blocks In this section, we prove several theorems which will be our basic tools in the sequel. First we prove lower bounds on the load and availability of b-masking quorum systems, against which we measure all our new constructions.

Reference-contexts: A boostFPP system is a composition of a finite projective plane (FPP) over a threshold system (Thresh). The first component of a boostFPP system is a finite projective plane of order q (a good reference on FPP's is <ref> [Hal86] </ref>). It is known that FPP's exist for q = p r when p is prime. Such an FPP has n F = q 2 + q + 1 elements, and quorums of size c (FPP) = q + 1.

Reference-contexts: However, when servers may suffer arbitrary (Byzantine) failures, the intersection property does not suffice for maintaining consistency; two quorums may intersect in a subset containing faulty servers only, who may deviate arbitrarily and undetectably from their assigned protocol. Malkhi and Reiter thus introduced masking quorums systems <ref> [MR97] </ref>, in which each pair of quorums intersects in sufficiently many servers to mask out the behavior of faulty servers. <p> In Section 4 we prove bounds on the load and crash failure probability for b-masking quorum systems and introduce quorum composition.

Lemma 3.6 Let Q be a quorum system. Then Q is b-masking if both the following conditions hold: 1. MT (Q) b + 1, - 4 - Proof: Assume that MT (Q) b + 1. <p> we prove the properties of a quorum composition technique, which we later use extensively. 4.1 The load and availability of masking quorum systems We begin by establishing a lower bound on the load of b-masking quorum systems, thus tightening the lower bound on general quorum systems [NW94] as presented in <ref> [MR97] </ref>. Theorem 4.1 Let Q be a b-masking quorum system. Then L (Q) maxf 2b+1 c (Q) n g: Proof: Let w be any strategy for the quorum system Q, and fix Q 1 2 Q such that jQ 1 j = c (Q). <p> Then L (Q) q n ; and equality holds if c (Q) = q Remark: Corollary 4.2 shows that the threshold construction of <ref> [MR97] </ref> in fact has optimal load when b = (n). E.g., when b n=4 the obtained load is 0:75, but for such systems we can only hope for a constant load of 1= p 2 = 0:707. <p> However the load of the threshold construction is always 1=2, which is far from optimal for smaller values of b. On the other hand, the grid-based construction of <ref> [MR97] </ref> does not have optimal load. It has quorums of size O (b p n) and load of roughly 2b= p n. In the sequel we show systems which significantly improve this: some of our new constructions have quorums of size O ( p and optimal load. <p> These systems significantly improve upon the original constructions of <ref> [MR97] </ref>, however both are still suboptimal in some parameter: M-Grid has optimal load but can mask only up to b = O ( p n) failures and has poor crash probability; and RT can mask up to b = O (n) failures and has near optimal crash probability, but has suboptimal <p> In the sequel, we often omit the depth parameter h when it has no effect on the discussion. The RT systems generalize the recursive majority constructions of [MP92], the HQS system of [Kum91] is an RT (3; 2) system, and in fact the threshold system of <ref> [MR97] </ref> can be viewed as a trivial RT (4b + 1; 3b + 1) system with depth h = 1. As an example throughout this section we will use the RT (4; 3) system, depicted in Figure 2.

Reference-contexts: Table 1: Constructions in this paper (n = number of servers). 2 Related work Our work borrows from prior work in benignly fault-tolerant quorum systems, which is extensive (e.g., <ref> [Gif79, Tho79, Mae85, GB85, Her86, BG87, ET89, AE91, CAA92, NW94, PW97b] </ref>).

The load of a quorum system was first defined and analyzed in <ref> [NW94] </ref>, which proved a lower bound of ( 1 p n ) on the load of any quorum system (and, a fortiori, any masking quorum system) over n servers. In proving load-optimality of our constructions, we generalize this lower bound to ( q b-masking quorum systems. <p> The technique of quorum composition, which we use in our RT and boostFPP constructions, has been studied in [MP92, NM92, Nei92] under various names such as "coterie join" and "recursive majority". Our M-Path construction generalizes the system of [WB92], coupled with the analysis of the Paths construction of <ref> [NW94] </ref>, and the recent system of [Baz96]. Several constructions of masking quorum systems were given in [MR97] for a variety of failure models. For the model we consider here|i.e., any b servers may experience Byzan-tine failures|that work gave two constructions. <p> Several measures will be of interest to us. 3.2.1 Load A measure of the inherent performance of a quorum system is its load. Naor and Wool define the load of a quorum system as the frequency of accessing the busiest server using the best possible strategy <ref> [NW94] </ref>. More precisely, given a quorum system Q, an access strategy w is a probability distribution on the elements of Q; i.e., P Q2Q w (Q) = 1. The value w (Q) 0 is the frequency of choosing quorum Q when the service is accessed. <p> Recall that c (Q) denotes the cardinality of the smallest quorum in Q. The following result will be useful to us in the sequel (recall Definition 3.2). Proposition 3.9 <ref> [NW94] </ref> Let Q be a fair quorum system. Then L (Q) = c (Q)=n. 3.2.2 Availability By definition a b-masking quorum system can mask up to b arbitrary (Byzantine) failures. However, such a system may be resilient to more benign failures. <p> Then we prove the properties of a quorum composition technique, which we later use extensively. 4.1 The load and availability of masking quorum systems We begin by establishing a lower bound on the load of b-masking quorum systems, thus tightening the lower bound on general quorum systems <ref> [NW94] </ref> as presented in [MR97]. Theorem 4.1 Let Q be a b-masking quorum system. Then L (Q) maxf 2b+1 c (Q) n g: Proof: Let w be any strategy for the quorum system Q, and fix Q 1 2 Q such that jQ 1 j = c (Q). <p> The minimal - 11 - transversals of an FPP are of size MT (FPP) = q + 1 (in fact the only transversals of this size are the quorums themselves). The load of FPP was analyzed in <ref> [NW94] </ref> and shown to be L (FPP) = q+1 p n F , which is optimal for regular quorum systems. The second component of a boostFPP is a Thresh system, with n T = 4b + 1 elements and a threshold of 3b + 1. <p> We have also constructed a second system which is based on the square lattice with elements corresponding to the edges, as in <ref> [NW94] </ref>. The properties of this second system are almost identical to those of M-Path, so we omit it. Proposition 7.1 Let b = (k 2 1)=2.

Hybrid failure models have been considered in other works (e.g., <ref> [LR93, LR94, RB94] </ref>). 3 Preliminaries We assume a universe U of servers, jU j = n, over which our quorum systems will be constructed. Servers that obey their specifications are correct. A faulty server, however, may deviate from its specification arbitrarily.
