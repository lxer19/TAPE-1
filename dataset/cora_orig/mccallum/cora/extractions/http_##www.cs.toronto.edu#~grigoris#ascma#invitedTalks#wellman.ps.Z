Abstract: For the past six years, my research group at the University of Michigan has been investigating, quasi-systematically, technical issues in the design of computational markets. Herein I sketch a map outlining the problem, and the directions of some of our explorations. 1 . WHERE IS MARKETSPACE? Computational markets comprise a subclass of multiagent systems where the primary mode of interaction is via markets. The design space for computational markets is defined by the cross product of the space of market mechanisms, and the space of market configurations. Focusing on marketspace entails a commitment to several characteristics of a multiagent system. The amount of money exchanged for a unit of resource is i ts price. A price system restricts exchanges to occur at fixed ratios defined by relative prices. The degree of this restriction depends on the scope of prices, that is, to what universe of agents and times the particular prices apply. For example, the scope of a price might be a single exchange, or it may govern all exchanges by all agents within a specified period. 2 . MARKET MECHANISMS Once we have established a price system for exchange of resources among self-interested agents, it remains to define a resource allocation mechanism to determine which exchanges take place, at what terms (prices). A mechanism in this context is that part of a protocol governing the behavior of system elements, which generally dictates or enforces rules over participating agents. As the mechanism designer generally does not have control over agent behavior, the mechanism cannot depend on private information held by agents. However, in predicting the result of a mechanism, we generally must model the possible behavior of agents, that is, our unit of analysis is the entire protocol. 2 . 1 Mediation and Auctions A mediator manages and perhaps enforces the rules of an allocation mechanism. Without mediators, arbitrary communication is possible, and so unmediated systems rely o n convention and cooperation to enforce mechanisms. In a market mechanism, the mediatorscalled auctionsspecify some process for determining prices as a function of messages from the participating agents. 2 . 2 Decentralized Protocols We say that a protocol is decentralized to the extent that i t respects the autonomy of participating agents. At a minimum, the mechanism must not presume access to agents private information. Protocols dictating by fiat that agents transmit their essential state to the mediator would therefore be extremely centralized. At the other extreme is a protocol that imposes no restrictions on participating agents.
