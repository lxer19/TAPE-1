Abstract: A score certificate for a tournament, T , is a collection of arcs of T which can be uniquely completed to a tournament with the same score-list as T 's, and the score certificate number of T is the least number of arcs in a score certificate of T . Upper bounds on the score certificate number of upset tournaments are derived. The upset tournaments on n vertices are in one-to-one correspondence with the ordered partitions of n3, and are "almost" transitive tournaments. For each upset tournament on n vertices a general construction of a score certificate with at most 2n 3 arcs is given. Also, for the upset tournament, T , corresponding to the ordered partition , a score certificate with at most n + 2k + 3 arcs is constructed, where k is the number of parts of of size at least 2. Lower bounds on the score certificate number of T in the case that each part is sufficiently large are derived. In particular, the score certificate number of the so-called nearly transitive tournament on n vertices is shown to be n + 3, for n 10.

The upset tournaments on n vertices possess special structural properties. <p> Thus, one can view the upset tournaments as a class of strongly connected tournaments that are "almost" transitive. Since equality holds in (1) for the transitive tournaments, it is natural to examine the score certificate number of upset tournaments. It follows from the results in <ref> [BL] </ref> that the upset tournaments have a special structure, which we now describe. An ordered partition of the positive integer ` is a tuple of positive integers whose sum is `. <p> It is easy to verify that T is an upset tournament. For example, the nearly transitive the electronic journal of combinatorics 5 (1998), #R24 4 tournament on n vertices is isomorphic to T (n3) . It follows from results in <ref> [BL] </ref> that the nonisomorphic upset tournaments of order n are precisely the T where runs over all ordered partitions of n 3. Hence, there are exactly 2 n4 non-isomorphic upset tournaments of order n.

Reference-contexts: A tournament, T , on V is a directed graph obtained by replacing each edge of the complete graph on V with a directed arc. Thus, a tournament represents a complete, asymmetric, irreflexive binary relation. Throughout we use the notation and terminology for tournaments in <ref> [M] </ref>. We denote the arc from vertex v i to vertex v j by the ordered pair (v i ; v j ). The score of a vertex v j 2 V is its outdegree. The score-list of T is the multiset of outdegrees of the vertices of T . <p> We conclude this introductory section with necessary preliminaries concerning upset tournaments. Clearly, a transitive tournament is not strongly connected and has no 3-cycles. It follows from results in <ref> [M] </ref> that each upset tournament on n vertices has exactly n 2 3-cycles, and this is the least among strongly connected tournaments on n vertices. Thus, one can view the upset tournaments as a class of strongly connected tournaments that are "almost" transitive. <p> Proposition 2.3 Let T be an upset tournament on n vertices. Then T contains a unique hamiltonian cycle. Proof. Without loss of generality we may assume that the vertices of T are labelled so that T is in standard form. Since T is strongly connected, it is well-known (see <ref> [M] </ref>) that T has a hamiltonian cycle. Let H denote a hamiltonian cycle in T . The upset path must be a subpath of H, since it is the unique path from v 1 to v n .
