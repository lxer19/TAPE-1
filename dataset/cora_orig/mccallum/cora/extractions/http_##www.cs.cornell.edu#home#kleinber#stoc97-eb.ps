Abstract: In this paper, we undertake the first study of statistical multiplexing from the perspective of approximation algorithms. The basic issue underlying statistical multiplexing is the following: in high-speed networks, individual connections (i.e. communication sessions) are very bursty, with transmission rates that vary greatly over time. As such, the problem of packing multiple connections together on a link becomes more subtle than in the case when each connection is assumed to have a fixed demand. We consider one of the most commonly studied models in this domain: that of two communicating nodes connected by a set of parallel edges, where the rate of each connection between them is a random variable. We consider three related problems: (1) stochastic load balancing, (2) stochastic bin-packing, and (3) stochastic knapsack. In the first problem the number of links is given and we want to minimize the expected value of the maximum load. In the other two problem the link capacity and an allowed overflow probability p are given, and the objective is to assign connections to links, so that the probability that the load exceeds the link capacity is at most p. For the stochastic load balancing problem we give an O(1)-approximation algorithm for arbitrary random variables. For the other two problems we have algorithms restricted to on-off sources (the most common special case studied in the statistical multiplexing literature), with a somewhat weaker range of performance guarantees. A standard approach that has emerged for dealing with probabilistic resource requirements is the notion of effective bandwidth | this is a means of associating a fixed demand with a bursty connection that "represents" its distribution as closely as possible. Our approximation algorithms make use of the standard definition of effective bandwidth and also a new one that we introduce; the performance guarantees are based on new results showing that a combination of these measures can be used to provide bounds on the optimal solution. fl Research for this paper was supported in part by NSF through grant DMS 9505155.

Reference-contexts: Let us define the value of a set of connections to be the sum of their expectations; we consider the problem of accepting a set of connections of maximum value. We run the on-line algorithm of Awerbuch, Azar, and Plotkin <ref> [2] </ref>, using E [X i ] as the demand for connection (s i ; t i ) and 1 4 c e as the capacity of edge e. The analysis of [2] can then be used to show the following. <p> We run the on-line algorithm of Awerbuch, Azar, and Plotkin <ref> [2] </ref>, using E [X i ] as the demand for connection (s i ; t i ) and 1 4 c e as the capacity of edge e. The analysis of [2] can then be used to show the following. <p> Lemma 4.5 shows that such a routing violates the link-based overflow constraint on edge e, and hence any path through the edge e violates the connection-based overflow constraint. It follows that our routing is within O (log jEj) of optimal. We note that the analysis of <ref> [2] </ref> also allows us to provide performance guarantees in terms of more general notions of "value."
