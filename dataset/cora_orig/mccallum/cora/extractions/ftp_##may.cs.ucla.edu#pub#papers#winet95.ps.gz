Reference-contexts: These factors range from having to support different patterns of node mobility to integrating the traffic generators, networking algorithms, and operating system capabilities. A few operating system kernels and languages have been designed to support wireless and mobile communication <ref> [1] </ref>, and a number of protocols have been devised to solve the numerous topology setup and maintenance, media access control, and trans mission problems in the mobile environment [10]. Commercial radios designed to be hooked up with laptops for wireless multimedia transmissions are available in the market. <p> In order to support implementation, the approach used in the x-kernel and Scout projects at the University of Arizona is to develop an operating system which can support the implementation of networking protocols <ref> [1] </ref>. Of the related work, few address the development of a simulation environment to model the various components used in mobile wireless network systems, and none of them support parallel simulation and a direct path between implementation and simulation for validation and experimentation. 6.

Reference-contexts: Lastly, the environment is modular and extensible, in the sense that different components of the mobile network can be modeled at different levels of detail. Thus, it can be useful to develop in a simulation which utilizes several different levels of detail <ref> [2] </ref>. The modeling environment is designed to allow the primary components of the wireless network system to be simulated at different levels of detail.

Reference-contexts: This paper describes a simulation environment for wireless networks that is built using the Maisie <ref> [3] </ref> simulation language. Maisie has been implemented on both sequential and parallel architectures. The paper describes the environment and presents experimental results using sequential execution of the models. The environment is currently being ported to a parallel architecture. <p> The simulation environment can be used to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of algorithms as a function of the application requirements, mobility patterns, and radio characteristics. The simulator is being built on top of an existing message-passing based parallel simula tion language called Maisie <ref> [3] </ref>. Maisie is a message-based discrete event simulation language that provides a rich set of modeling constructs to facilitate the design of concise network models.

Reference-contexts: The experiments reported in this study used only the sequential Maisie implementations. Parallel Maisie implementations have yielded significant performance improvements for a number of example studies <ref> [4] </ref>. We intend to explore the viability of the parallel implementation in improving the performance of simulation models for wireless networks such as those described in this paper.

This radio is currently able to operate at speeds from 7 to 32 Kbps depending on the desired spreading factor.

Many of the algorithms being designed for mobile wireless systems are built to support a particular device or manufacturer. Algorithms which are not designed for a specific radio face the problem of trying to predict their performance over a wide parameter space of available radio alternatives.

Reference-contexts: These transport protocols interact with the applications described in the previous section by using sockets to buffer the bit stream so packetization can take place. Additional services are also being developed to support multimedia over mobile hosts <ref> [13] </ref>. Although wireless communication is useful to support mobile communication, wired connections can support a much higher bandwidth and are less prone to errors then wireless radios. Therefore, wired connections should be utilized whenever possible.
