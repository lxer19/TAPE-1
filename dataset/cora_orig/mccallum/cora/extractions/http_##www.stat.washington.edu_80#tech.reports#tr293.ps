Abstract: We address the problem of estimating the support domain of a bounded spatial point process in the presence of background noise. This happens for example when detecting a minefield from aerial observations. The image returned by the electronic device contains putative mine locations and is corrupted by clutter. The problem is to find the boundaries of the minefield and to estimate the number of mines inside the minefield. The maximum likelihood solution is worked out in the case of a mixture of uniform random variables by use of a natural tesselation of the plane defined by the data themselves: the Vorono tesselation. The method is then tested for 1 and 2 dimensional simulated processes; it is shown that this estimator is robust when applied to more regular point processes.

Reference-contexts: In order to compare the relative performances of the two approaches, simulations have been performed for a mixture of a uniform random variable on A 0 = [0:25; 0:50] (probability p = 1=3) and a uniform random variable on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. 500 simulations have been carried out for various values of the number of data points n. <p> We will prove this result in the case where K = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and A 0 = [0; a 0 ]. Considering the more general interval [a 0 ; b 0 ] introduces nothing new under a theoretical standpoint, but merely makes the equations more complex. <p> K = <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; A 0 = [0; 0:25]; p = 1=3. y (0) = 0, and y (n) = 1. The restricted set of solutions for a that we are allowed to consider is the set of the y (k) 's. <p> The two estimators ^a and ~a are indicated. Paraphrasing the argument above, it is quite clear that ~a is also a consistent estimator. Actually, any estimator based on the maximization of ` 0 on some set dense in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> when n ! 1 would be consistent. More interesting is the rate at which this estimator converges. It turns out that the approximate MLE based on the fy (k) g has also an efficiency in the order of 1=n 2 for n large enough.
