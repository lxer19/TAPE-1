Abstract: In order to define the smoothness of a piecewise polynomial surface, the domains of adjacent pieces must be related to one another by connecting maps; such maps reparametrize the surface pieces by mapping the domains of adjacent pieces to a joint domain. We characterize the subclass of connecting maps that can be used to surround a point by three or more pieces. The characterization of connecting maps for second order continuity suggests a lower bound on the degree of any curvature continuous surface assembled from polynomial pieces. A popular approach to modeling smooth parametric surfaces is to assemble them from polynomial patches p k : k IR 2 7! IR 3 . To determine the smoothness of transition from one patch to its neighbor, the domains of adjacent patches must locally be mapped to a joint domain so that directions of differentiation are well defined. Thus connecting maps k : IR 2 7! k play a central role in the construction of smooth parametric surfaces, affecting for example the polynomial degree and the shape of the surfaces. Of particular interest for constructions is the subclass of connecting maps that can be used to smoothly surround a point by three or more patches. The paper characterizes this subclass. When three or more patches join smoothly at a common point, the pairwise continuity constraints between the patches form a circular system. Correspondingly, the composition of all n connecting maps must map any initial domain to itself and must agree with the identity map, id, at the preimage of the common point up to the given order of continuity (cf. [2, Theorem x1. Motivation

Reference-contexts: Let := 1 be the connecting map between p and q, := 1 be quadratic and choose the data such that symmetry implies D 2 [2] i 1. If d is the degree of fl then the left hand side of the G 1 constraints (cf. <ref> [1] </ref>) D 1 fl = D 2 p + D 2 q (G 1 ) is of degree d 1 + 2 and hence D 2 p and D 2 q are formally of degree d + 1.

Unless we have cancellation, D 2 2 p and D 2 must therefore be of degree d + 2 and, if none of the intermediate polynomials are degree-raised, p and q must be of degree d + 4.

Reference-contexts: To improve our chances of fitting a low degree surface we may decrease the combinatorial complexity of the input mesh by inserting a midpoint on every edge and connecting the midpoints of a cell to its centroid (see <ref> [3] </ref>). After this refinement every original vertex is surrounded by vertices of degree four and all cells are quadrilateral.
