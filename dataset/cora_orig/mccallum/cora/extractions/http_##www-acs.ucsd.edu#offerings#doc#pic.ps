Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction PIC is a language for drawing simple pictures. It operates as yet another TROFF <ref> [1] </ref> preprocessor, (in the same style as EQN [2], TBL [3] and REFER [4]), with pictures marked by .PS and .PE. PIC was inspired partly by Chris Van Wyk's early work on IDEAL [5]; it has somewhat the same capabilities, but quite a different flavor.

Theo Pavlidis contributed the basic spline algorithm. Charles Wetherell pointed out reference <ref> [2] </ref> to me, and made several valuable criticisms on an early draft of the language and manual. The exposition in this version has been greatly improved by suggestions from Jim Blinn.

In particular, PIC is much more procedurala picture is drawn by specifying (sometimes in painful detail) the motions that one goes through to draw it.

Reference-contexts: In particular, PIC is much more procedurala picture is drawn by specifying (sometimes in painful detail) the motions that one goes through to draw it. Other direct influences include the PICTURE language <ref> [6] </ref> and the V viewgraph language [7]. This paper is primarily a user's manual for PIC; a discussion of design issues and user experience may be found in [8]. The next section shows how to use PIC in the most simple way.

Reference-contexts: But if one has only standard terminals (at home, for instance), then a linear representation of a figure is better. Furthermore, it is possible to generate PIC input from a program: I have used AWK <ref> [9] </ref> to extract numbers from a report and generate the PIC commands to make histograms. This is hard to imagine with most of the interactive systems I know of.
