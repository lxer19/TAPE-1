Abstract: The Twenty-One project brings together environmental organisations, technology providers and research institutes from several European countries. The main objective of the project is to make documents on environmental issues - in particular, on the subject of sustainable development - available on CDROM and on the Internet. At present, these documents exist on different media (paper, electronic documents, audiovisual material), in different formats (HTML, word processor) and in different languages. This diversity impedes the distribution of documents through normal channels, and makes it hard to search for and retrieve targeted material on specified subjects. The project is developing search engines that can locate required information, and uses automatic translation tools to make foreign-language texts available. Authors and editors gain economic advantages by the increased distribution of their documents, and users find documents more readily available and easily accessible.

Reference-contexts: Therefore tools that can automate the acquisition of lexical resources are not only important for the domain specific vocabulary, but could also be of value for the generic part. The dictionaries envisaged for Twenty-One will merge these various lexical resources. For an overview of selected techniques and experiments, see <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. 3.3 The Twenty-One search kernel In order to assure maximal flexibility, the Twenty-One retrieval module supports several query-and search strategies. In this section, we briefly discuss the main characteristics of the search and retrieval components. In section 3.3.1, emphasis is put on the global functionality.

Reference-contexts: This LR grammar can be compiled into a deterministic parser by the use of YACC 3 . In the same manner, a chart parser [12, 13] can be produced by using NLYACC <ref> [4] </ref>. The deterministic version cannot handle ambiguous tokens. The nondeterministic version can handle lexical and structural ambiguity at the cost of some speed.

Reference-contexts: We have planned several internal activities for monitoring and evaluating the quality of the software modules. In addition, the project takes part in external bench marking activities, as is shown by our participation in the TREC 6 Special Track on Cross Language Information Retrieval <ref> [5] </ref>. 3.1.2 Global system characteristics The aforementioned design assumptions constitute the basics for the development of the Twenty-One Demonstrator, embracing disclosure as well as retrieval functionality. The global functionality of the modules can be summarised as follows: Multimedia handling.

Reference-contexts: The Twenty-One index is, unlike most ordinary retrieval systems, not limited to an inverted file index based on single words or lemmas. It combines phrase based indexing with a vector space model (VSM). Experiments with phrase-based indexing within Twenty-One have shown a considerable improvement in retrieval performance <ref> [see 6, 7, 8] </ref>. Using a phrase-based index, users are allowed to query the system by using complete phrases, extending the level of simple keywords, such as: effects of acid rain of forests in the Netherlands.

Reference-contexts: The challenge is to develop robust term translation techniques which can preserve the morpho-syntactic information of the NP structure. This structure is available because every document is processed by the monolingual NLP modules, as described in section 3.2.3. Identification and translation of multiword expressions is a well-known problem <ref> [11] </ref>, but, by combining corpus based approaches and bilingual dictionaries, this problem can be tackled up to a level that is adequate for the purposes of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR).
