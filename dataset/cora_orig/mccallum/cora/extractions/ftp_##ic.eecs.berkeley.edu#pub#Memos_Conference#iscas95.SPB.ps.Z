Title: Power-up Delay for Retiming Digital Circuits  
Author: Vigyan Singhal Carl Pixley Robert K. Brayton 
Abstract: Retiming is sometimes used to optimize gate-level sequential designs. This technique allows memory elements to be moved across combinational elements. Unfortunately, retiming may cause the environment of a design to wait for a few additional clock cycles after power-up to guarantee the same behavior as the original design. Leiserson and Saxe [1] presented a bound on this number of clock cycles; in this paper, we tighten this bound. A smaller bound allows the environment of a design to wait for fewer clock cycles.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Retiming, first formulated by Leiserson and Saxe <ref> [1] </ref> in the context of systolic systems, is a method for moving memory elements or registers (implemented by edge-triggered latches or flip-flops) across combinational logic to achieve a minimum clock period, a minimum area, or a combination of these cost functions. <p> In this paper, we identify the cause of the additional delay due to retiming as forward retiming moves across fanout junctions or multi-output gates for which some output vector cannot be generated by any input vector. 2.2 Leiserson-Saxe Retiming Model Leiserson and Saxe introduced retiming <ref> [1] </ref> through a graph-theoretic model. A design is modeled as a finite edge-weighted directed graph G = (V; E). Each vertex in V represents a gate in the design. <p> It is shown in [2] that if circuit D is replaced by circuit C, then no environment can detect the replacement by controlling and observing the inputs and outputs of the circuit. 2.5 Delayed Designs We need the notion of delayed designs (similar to sufficiently old configuration of <ref> [1] </ref>) to show the results in our paper. Given a design D, an n-cycle-delayed design (denoted by D n ) is a subset of states of D. <p> If there are forward retiming moves, retiming may change the behavior of a design. The following is a rephrasing of the result proved by Leiserson and Saxe <ref> [1] </ref>: Theorem 3.2 (the Retiming Lemma in [1]) If a design C is obtained from design D after a sequence of atomic retiming moves such for each element no more than k forward retiming moves are made, then C k D. <p> If there are forward retiming moves, retiming may change the behavior of a design. The following is a rephrasing of the result proved by Leiserson and Saxe <ref> [1] </ref>: Theorem 3.2 (the Retiming Lemma in [1]) If a design C is obtained from design D after a sequence of atomic retiming moves such for each element no more than k forward retiming moves are made, then C k D. The contribution of this paper is that we tighten the above result.

Reference-contexts: It has earlier been shown <ref> [2] </ref> that retiming can change the sequential behavior of a design. Given a sequential circuit with some registers, each register can non-deterministically initialize in any state, 0 or 1, after the circuit is powered up. <p> The problem is that if a single output of an element fans out to more than one element, the above graph-theoretic model does not determine where the registers are placed with respect to the fanout junction. This has been illustrated in <ref> [2] </ref>, where two retimed circuits are represented by the same retiming graph (the original circuit has a register just before a fanout junction, and this register is retimed across the junction in the retimed circuit). <p> It is shown in <ref> [2] </ref> that if circuit D is replaced by circuit C, then no environment can detect the replacement by controlling and observing the inputs and outputs of the circuit. 2.5 Delayed Designs We need the notion of delayed designs (similar to sufficiently old configuration of [1]) to show the results in our <p> Thus, the design D n will be design D minus some transient states of design D which can be seen only during the first n cycles after power-up. 3 Power-up Delay Caused by Retiming Moves First, we restate the result that earlier proved in <ref> [2] </ref>: Theorem 3.1 If C is obtained from D using an arbitrary sequence of retiming moves, none of which is a forward retiming move across a non-justifiable element, then C D. If there are forward retiming moves, retiming may change the behavior of a design.
