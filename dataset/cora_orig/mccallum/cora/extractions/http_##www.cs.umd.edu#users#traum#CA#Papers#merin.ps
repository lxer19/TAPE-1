Title: Communicative Action as Bargaining: Utility, Relevance, Elementary Social Acts  
Author: Arthur Merin 
Address: Azenbergstr. 12, 70174 Stuttgart, Germany.  
Affiliation: Institute of Language and Computation (IMS) University of Stuttgart  
Abstract: I outline an approach to communicative action (CA). Its bases are (i) a bargaining game approach to Elementary Social Acts (ESAs) and (ii) a Decision-Theoretic Semantics (DTS) in which utility and, as a special case, evidential relevance play a central role. The act analysis is extended to a variety of act types. Examples of various kinds of `conventional' and `conversational' implicature illustrate how act- and relevance-structure feed into one another. More specific issues addressed include: implications of modelling communication as a coordination game, empirical problems of act-imputation by discourse participants, and mining utterance structure for cues to ostensible utterer's intention.

Reference-contexts: Another usefully contrasting approach is the system of Traum and Allen (1994) in which the juridical notion of obligation (imposed by social convention) is introduced as a primitive to supplement lacunae in plan-and intention-based approaches <ref> (e.g. Cohen and Levesque 1990) </ref> to CA. Cp. Merin (1994b). Accordingly, the evidence for the choice of frame-work is primarily its performance in explaining non-peripheral linguistic data, i.e. robust, spontaneous native speaker intuitions on acceptability and paraphrase.

Reference-contexts: Problems akin to those of the first kind have prompted many to dismiss speech act type as a piece of super 1 Several technical reports are available online at http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/SFB340.html fluous baggage (Gazdar 1981). Similarly, the inadequacy of traditional speech act theory to deal with intonation <ref> (Cutler 1977) </ref> may warrant suspicions that its categorizations were inadequate not only to this purpose (Merin and Bartels 1997; cp. Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1990) but also to others.

Reference-contexts: The exposition aims to provide tools for addressing two specific problems raised explicitly or implicitly by participants to the symposium: * People can be shown to vary widely in assignment of speech act categories to utterances <ref> (Di Eugenio et al 1997) </ref>. * Many working systems analyzing and synthesizing aspects of CA very consciously opt for a `template' approach to utterance meaning (e.g. Thomason and Hobbs 1997).

Reference-contexts: questions: (a) the politico-juridical question | which, if any, of these pictures better characterizes the median of social interaction types, or a given social situation; (b) the linguistic question | whether a convention of interpretation predicated on unilateral authority relations or one predicated on bilateral influence, i.e. explicit or tacit <ref> (Harsanyi 1977) </ref> bargaining underlies interpretive strategies in the uptake of meaning. Theories of CA will have to attend to both questions and explore what, if any, degree of dependence there is between their answers in a given situation. <p> They have to decide whether a certain proposition , put forward by one of them, is to become a joint commitment (JC) constraining their beliefs (`epistemic') or conduct (`deon-tic'). I.e. a decision is to be made about adoption of a `jointly randomized strategy' <ref> (Harsanyi 1977) </ref>, where randomization for present purposes only admits of the `pure' cases. Suppose E proposes, i.e. claims (CLA E ). Then A has two options: (i) admit, i.e. concede (CON A ), whereupon becomes a JC; (ii) deny (DEN A ).

Reference-contexts: Outlook Further types of phenomena where DTS has proved useful include those of presupposition. Issue-based construal leads to a formal handle on such notions as `salience' and `active context' (Kripke n.d.) and to an explication of a passing observation that accomodables should be `uncontroversial' (ibid.). The explication <ref> (Merin 1997c) </ref> yields a purely decision-theoretic explanation why the narrow-scope-negation reading of The duke of Paris is not bald should be favoured (and the wide-scope one invariably sarcastic).

Reference-contexts: of assertion is, in fact, the analysis of a flat, disinterested and undeniable statement. 4 The coordination game embodied in Grice's Cooperative Principle presupposes a social relationship that cannot simply be assumed to govern dialogue on issues of vital interest. 5 A serious alternative contender here is the bargaining game <ref> (Nash 1953) </ref> where both common interests (e.g. getting a cake it takes two to reach) and opposed interests (deciding on the distribution) enter the picture. <p> Already here we are ready for an immediate explanatory payoff whose value will be an increasing function of the time one has spent pondering the underlying problem.
