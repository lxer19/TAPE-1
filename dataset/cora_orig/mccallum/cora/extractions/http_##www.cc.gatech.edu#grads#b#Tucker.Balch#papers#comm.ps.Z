Abstract: Multiple cooperating robots are able to complete many tasks more quickly and reliably than one robot alone. Communication between the robots can multiply their capabilities and effectiveness, but to what extent? In this research, the importance of communication in robotic societies is investigated through experiments on both simulated and real robots. Performance was measured for three different types of communication for three different tasks. The levels of communication are progressively more complex and potentially more expensive to implement. For some tasks, communication can significantly improve performance, but for others inter-agent communication is apparently unnecessary. In cases where communication helps, the lowest level of communication is almost as effective as the more complex type. The bulk of these results are derived from thousands of simulations run with randomly generated initial conditions. The simulation results help determine appropriate parameters for the reactive control system which was ported for tests on Denning mobile robots.

The work as reported in <ref> [1] </ref> is very preliminary. Werner and Dyer [52] have studied the evolution of communication in synthetic agents. They have demonstrated that directional mating signals can evolve in these systems given the presence of societal necessity.

Reference-contexts: At the Georgia Tech Mobile Robotics Laboratory, such a robot system design methodology has been developed and refined for both single and multia-gent robotic systems. These systems are implemented in both simulation and on mobile robots (e.g., <ref> [3] </ref>, [13]). The approach relies on two key points: 1) an objective metric of system perfor mance, and 2) an iterative cycle of simulation and instantiation on real systems. Through simulation, the designer can quickly discover which sensors, actuators, and control parameters are most critical. <p> Brooks' subsumption architecture is a well-known example of this control paradigm [15]. Other representative examples include <ref> [3] </ref>, [30], [46], [39], [49]. These various strategies differ in several significant ways including the organization and decomposition of behaviors and whether arbitration, action-selection, or concurrent processing is used. The interested reader is referred to [8] for a more complete review. <p> The interested reader is referred to [8] for a more complete review.

[7] In schema-based control, each of the active behaviors (motor schemas) computes its reaction to its perceptual stimuli using a method analogous to potential fields <ref> [3] </ref>. It must be noted that unlike traditional potential fields [33], [32], the entire field is never computed, only the robot's reaction to its current perception of the world at its present location. All of these independent computations are summed and normalized and then sent to the robot for execution. <p> Problems with local minima, maxima, and cyclic behavior which are endemic to many potential fields strategies are handled by several methods including: the injection of noise into the system <ref> [3] </ref>; resorting to high-level planning [6]; repulsion from previously visited locales [14]; continuous adaptation [17]; and other learning strategies [47], [48]. Schema-based robot control has been demonstrated to provide robust navigation in complex and dynamic worlds. <p> The simulator has been a useful tool for other research in the Mobile Robot Lab at Georgia Tech, 10 Balch and Arkin including [9], [17], [47], [37], [14] among others. Results generated in this simulation environment have routinely been demonstrated on actual mobile robots (e.g., <ref> [3] </ref>, [12], [13], [14]). Except for minor changes 3 , the present simulator is the same one used in these earlier projects. The simulator may be run in a visual mode, or in a text-only mode. The visual mode is used primarily for debugging and qualitative accessments.

Reference-contexts: All of these independent computations are summed and normalized and then sent to the robot for execution.

Reference-contexts: Drogoul and Ferber [20] report results of simulations of foraging robots demonstrating the spontaneous evolution of structure such as chains from extremely simple agents. A pressing question, and one which the research described in this article addresses, is the role of communication in multiagent robotic systems. Arkin <ref> [5] </ref> previously reported that successful task-achieving behavior can occur even in the absence of communication between agents. Al-tenburg and Pavicic created a multi-robot society consisting of a group of small robots conducting a search and retrieve task using either an infra-red or incandescent recruitment signal. <p> The interested reader is referred to [8] for a more complete review. Schema-based reactive control has been widely used with success in our laboratory for both simulation studies and real robot implementations 6 Balch and Arkin (e.g., [3], <ref> [5] </ref>, [12], [13], [14]). <p> The baseline data was computed by first selecting a reasonable set of control parameters, then running a statistically significant number of simulations. Values for these parameters are based on previous research <ref> [5] </ref>. In this section, the behaviors for executing the three tasks (F orage, Consume, and Graze) and their baseline parameters are described. At the highest level, the tasks themselves are assemblages which are represented as finite state acceptors (FSAs) consisting of several states. <p> The robots are able to discriminate internally three perceptual classes: other robots, attractors, and obstacles. None of this information, however, is communicated to other agents. Each robot must rely entirely upon its own perception of the world. Arkin has shown in previous work <ref> [5] </ref> that this basic information is enough to support cooperation in robot retrieval tasks (Forage). Cooperation in this context refers to the observed phenomena of recruitment, where multiple agents converge together to work on the same task.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [9] </ref>, this type of communication was shown to provide a distinct advantage over no communication for performance of the Forage task. Communication is often considered a deliberate act, but state communication is not necessarily "intentional" since information can be relayed by passive observation. <p> The test environment for this research is written in C using the X Windows graphics package.

Avoid-static-obstacle is also used for nonthreatening moving objects. Other schemas such as escape and dodge can be used for non-cooperative moving objects when appropriate. 3.

Reference-contexts: Since communication is important in many natural societies it is appropriate to look to them for inspiration. Our strategy for creating multiagent systems has been significantly influenced by biological and ethological studies. In <ref> [10] </ref>, we reported the dimensions by which communication can be described in these systems. A few specific examples of the role of communication in animal societies are reported below. One of the most commonly studied social biological systems is that of ants.

Reference-contexts: At the highest level, the tasks themselves are assemblages which are represented as finite state acceptors (FSAs) consisting of several states. FSAs provide an easy means for both expressing and reasoning about behavioral sets by providing formal semantics <ref> [11] </ref>. Each state corresponds to a separate assemblage in which a constituent set of motor schemas is instantiated if that particular state is active. P erceptual T riggers cause transitions between states.

Reference-contexts: The research in this article concentrates on relatively small group sizes, typically on the order of two to ten agents. Large scale swarm robotic systems (e.g., <ref> [27] </ref>) are not considered. Fukuda was among the first to study multia-gent robotic systems in the context of what he refers to as cellular robotics [24]. This pioneering work is mainly concerned with heterogeneous agents.

Reference-contexts: Consume, and Graze without communication. Note that speedup for all tasks is generally higher for larger numbers of attractors. Researchers in other branches of computer science have found that randomized search tasks are often completed in superlinear time on parallel systems <ref> [28] </ref>. Since the wander behavior used in all three tasks essentially solves a randomized search task, it is not surprising that performance is superlinear when this behavior is heavily utilized, as is the case when there are large numbers of attractors.

Reference-contexts: Two omnidirectional sensor systems have been evaluated for multiagent robot implementation at Georgia Tech: a conic mirror camera system, and a laser barcode reading system. The conic mirror camera system was originally developed by MacKenzie for the Georgia Tech Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Team <ref> [35] </ref>. It is intended for localization of an unmanned robotic helicopter. Bright lights located about the environment serve as reference points for triangulation. The chief advantage is speed; image processing demands are comparatively low. Conic vision can be readily adapted for mobile robot systems as follows.

Reference-contexts: Once appropriate waypoints for each group are selected, virtual attractors can be placed there. The behavior would emerge as each two element group successively moves from attractor to attractor. Other research in our laboratory is underway which investigates how complex behaviors may be specified as combinations of basic behaviors <ref> [36] </ref>. The research includes a language which allows individual robots, and societies of robots to be described formally. Formal operators allow basic, or primitive, behaviors to be grouped into more complex assemblages. These assemblages are further combined to form the overall behavior of the robot.

Reference-contexts: Figure 1c shows a simulation of two robots grazing over 95% of the environment. The robots leave dashed lines as they wander, and solid lines when they graze. Grazing robots might be used to mow, plow or seed fields, vacuum houses <ref> [37] </ref>, or remove scrub in a lumber producing forest. The size of the swath that a robot can graze, and the percentage of the area that the robot must graze over both affect how long it takes to complete the task. <p> The test environment for this research is written in C using the X Windows graphics package. The simulator has been a useful tool for other research in the Mobile Robot Lab at Georgia Tech, 10 Balch and Arkin including [9], [17], [47], <ref> [37] </ref>, [14] among others. Results generated in this simulation environment have routinely been demonstrated on actual mobile robots (e.g., [3], [12], [13], [14]). Except for minor changes 3 , the present simulator is the same one used in these earlier projects.

Reference-contexts: The work as reported in [1] is very preliminary. Werner and Dyer [52] have studied the evolution of communication in synthetic agents. They have demonstrated that directional mating signals can evolve in these systems given the presence of societal necessity. MacLennan <ref> [38] </ref> also has studied this problem and has concluded that communication can evolve in a society of simple robotic agents. In his studies, the societies which evolved communication were 84% fitter than those in which communication was suppressed. An order of magnitude better performance was observed when learning was introduced.

Reference-contexts: This pioneering work is mainly concerned with heterogeneous agents. The research reported in this article is for homogeneous societies, where all the agents are functionally equivalent.

In particular, learning methods have been evaluated (e.g., [45]). Applications of multiagent systems are also being investigated in military environments in both the United States and Europe [43], [34]. <p> Mataric introduced a similar metric of robot performance in <ref> [40] </ref>. Anywhere speedup is equal to 1.0, the performance is said to be linear. Superlinear performance is greater than 1.0, and sublinear is less than 1.0. Realize, however, that in some cases more robots will be faster for actual task completion time, but still offer sublinear speedup.

Three Tasks for Robotic Societies The task a robotic system is to perform dictates to some extent the sensors and actuators required. <p> Using a minimalist philosophy, the first type actually involves no direct communication between the agents. The second type allows for the transmission of state information between agents in a manner similar to that found in display behavior in animals <ref> [42] </ref>. The third type (goal communication) requires the transmitting agent to recognize and broadcast the location of an attractor when one is located within detectable range. Each of these forms of communication is described in more detail below. 5.1.
