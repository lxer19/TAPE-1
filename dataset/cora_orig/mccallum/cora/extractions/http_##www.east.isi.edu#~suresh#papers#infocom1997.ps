Abstract: Today it is evident that ATM technology will have its role in the future of Internetworking. Two major Internet backbone service providers, Sprint and MCI, have marketed their investments in ATM as a way to push more bandwidth into their Internet infrastructures. Regardless of whether ATM technology will thrive in the WAN or LAN, it is also evident that the Internet Protocol (IP), which has been the glue of the Internet allowing it to endure exponential growth, must be well supported over ATM. IP multicast (protocol extensions to IP that allow IP packets from one source to be distributed to multiple destinations) is an essential part of IP which has allowed multimedia applications, for example, to more efficiently use Internet resources. In this paper we describe an implementation of one model of supporting IP multicast over ATM, the Multicast over ATM model [1] developed by the IETF. We discuss empirical measurements gathered in a testbed with both a WAN and a LAN component that give insights into the behavior of this model. We detail some of the shortcomings of this model and discuss potential modifications to improve it. Ideas for other approaches to IP multicast over ATM are also described.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Multicast over ATM model described in "Support for Multicast over UNI 3.0/3.1 based ATM Networks" <ref> [1] </ref> (MC over ATM) is one model for supporting connectionless IP multicast over connection-oriented ATM networks. This model defines support for network layer multicasting over ATM using two different modes of operations. <p> The hosts registered with a MARS constitute a MARS cluster and can open direct VCCs to one another. Two such MARS clusters could be connected together through a multicast IP router (mrouter). An mrouter forwards multicast packets between different clusters. Refer to <ref> [1] </ref> for further details on MARS protocol entities. 5 Testing MC over ATM A configuration of the experimental testbed is shown in Figure 3. A requisite for testing IP multicast over ATM is to have a multicast capable host.

Reference-contexts: words "group address" or "multicast address" are used to mean network layer multicast group address. 2 Overview of MC over ATM There are three main entities in the MC over ATM model: * the Multicast Address Resolution Server (MARS), * the MARS client (a Classical IP over ATM en tity <ref> [2] </ref> running MARS client code), and * the Multicast Server (MCS). These entities communicate using a query-response style protocol. The MARS keeps a database that maps network layer multicast addresses to ATM layer addresses.

Reference-contexts: Benny includes many enhancements to VINCE and new code modules such as the MC over ATM implementation. Benny has been developed at USC/ISI and is freely available [4]. IP multicasting as defined in RFC 1112 <ref> [5] </ref> was designed as an extension to the normal IP layer found in a system kernel.

Reference-contexts: It would be interesting to place the MARS at Sprint in future experiments. An initial goal of this prototyping was to gauge the general performance of the MC over ATM model. The Benny code is instrumented with code that time stamps MARS and UNI signalling <ref> [8] </ref> messages in order to gather various latency measurements.

Reference-contexts: Distributed models, on the other hand, have a potential to offer a cleaner and more reliable solution at the expense of some extra complexity. One such model is the support for group addressing at the ATM layer. By using the ATM group addressing support defined in <ref> [11] </ref>, an ATM end system could do the IP to ATM group address translation by algorithmically mapping one from the other independent of any server. With this capability, a sender to a multicast group could specify an ATM group address as the destination of the data VCC.

Reference-contexts: With this capability, a sender to a multicast group could specify an ATM group address as the destination of the data VCC. It would be the job of PNNI <ref> [12] </ref> routing to create a VCC that reached all members of the multicast group. The PNNI routing protocol would need to be extended to do group address based routing.
