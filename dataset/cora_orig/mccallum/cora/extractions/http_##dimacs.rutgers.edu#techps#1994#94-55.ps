Reference-contexts: We shall use one of the basic results in the packing theory which says that, for any R &gt; 0; there are at most 2 3 R 2 + O (R) mutually non-overlaping disks of diameter 1 inside a disk of diameter R (e.g., see <ref> [FT 64] </ref>). The 1 2 -neighborhoods of points of P do not overlap. For each point a 2 P lying in the r-neighborhood of p; the 1 2 -neighborhood of a lies entirely in the (r + 1 2 )-neighborhood of p.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper is motivated by the investigations of so-called dense sets and by the following three results: Theorem 1 (Szemeredi-Trotter <ref> [ST 83] </ref>) Let P be a set of n points in the plane and let L be a family of m lines in the plane.

Reference-contexts: The size of P shall be denoted by n. A disk of radius r with center C shall be denoted by D (C; r): The paper is partially based on a part of the author's PhD. thesis <ref> [V 94] </ref>. 2 A crossing family of almost linear size In this section we give the proofs of the following two theorems which give slightly worse bounds than Theorems 8 and 9. <p> We do not expect that any approach based on the idea of Lemma 23 can give a substantially better bound in some of these two theorems. A tiny improvement upon the bound in Theorem 9 was shown in the author's PhD. thesis <ref> [V 94] </ref>. Theorem 27 ([V 94]) For every fixed ff &gt; 0; any ff-dense set of size n contains vertices of a crossing family of size ( n (log n) 3 log log log n+c ); where c = 3 log (1000ff 2 ) + 6: Theorem 27 relies on the <p> The improvement is very small in our case but we believe that the refinement might be more crucial with another method than our one. We do not prove Theorem 27 and Lemma 28 here. The reader can find the proofs in <ref> [V 94] </ref>. 4 Line-point incidences In this section we prove Theorem 7 and Corollary 10.
