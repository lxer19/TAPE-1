Abstract: Local optimization is used to set the free parameters in a triangular surface fitting scheme, resulting in surfaces with better shape. While some of the free parameters can be set to match curvature information, other free parameters are independent of this information. A large number of local parametric triangular surface schemes have been developed over the past fifteen years (see [8,9] for a survey of such schemes). These schemes are local in that changes to part of the data only affect portions of the surface near the changed data. Surprisingly, all of these schemes exhibit similar shape defects. On closer inspection, it is seen that these schemes all have a large number of free parameters that are set using simple heuristics. By manually adjusting these parameters, one can improve the shape of the surfaces [9]. In this paper, I will investigate using local optimization to set the free parameters in a local, triangular, split-domain, polynomial surface interpolation scheme. More precisely, given a triangle of data, this scheme constructs three triangular parametric polynomial patches, each of which interpolates two of the positions and normals at the three vertices. Further, the patches meet each other with G 1 continuity, and if used to fill a triangular polyhedron, the resulting surface will also be G 1 . Local optimization is used to set the remaining free parameters so as to minimize the error in interpolating second order data at the corners. Thus, our data is a set of three vertices with normals and second fundamental forms, (p i ; ^n i ; II i ), for i = P; Q; R. I will be working with a modified version of Shirman-Sequin's scheme [11,12]. Shirman and Sequin created a split domain scheme that fits three quartic patches to a triangle of data. These triangles meet each other G 1 , and if used x1. Introduction

Reference-contexts: If we construct boundary curves with quadratic precision, we could hope to achieve quadratic precision. However, using the Shirman-Sequin setting of the fis and cs does not have quadratic precision. Further, even if we use Jensen's generalization of the crossboundaries, we are unable to achieve quadratic precision <ref> [10] </ref>. Optimization in Surface Fitting 9 A second approach to setting the internal degrees of freedom would be to match more data contained in the second fundamental forms at the data points. In the previous section, we matched curvature at the ends of the exterior boundary curves. <p> We might also want additional equations to prevent the fis and cs from becoming too small or too large. However, the last is a moot point: as detailed in <ref> [10] </ref>, if we expand our curvature equations in terms of the control points and unknowns (the fis and the cs), then we find the equations are independent of all the fis and the cs.
