Abstract: Formal AI systems traditionally represent knowledge using logical formulas. We will show, however, that for certain kinds of information, a model-based representation is more compact and enables faster reasoning than the corresponding formula-based representation. The central idea behind our work is to represent a large set of models by a subset of characteristic models. More specifically, we examine model-based representations of Horn theories, and show that there are large Horn theories that can be exactly represented by an exponentially smaller set of characteristic models. In addition, we will show that deduction based on a set of characteristic models takes only linear time, thus matching the performance using Horn theories. More surprisingly, abduction can be performed in polynomial time using a set of characteristic models, whereas abduction using Horn theories is NP-complete. This papers appears in the Proceedings of the Eleventh National Conference on Artificial

However, the complexity of learning the characteristic models where the algorithm can only sample from the complete set of models is an interesting open problem.

Reference-contexts: More surprisingly, abduction can be performed in polynomial time using a set of characteristic models, whereas abduction using Horn theories is NP-complete [ Selman and Levesque, 1990 ] . This result is particularly interesting because very few other tractable classes of abduction problems are known <ref> [ Bylander et al., 1989; Selman, 1990 ] </ref> . 2 Horn Theories and Characteristic Models We assume a standard propositional language, and use a; b; c; d; p; and q to denote propositional variables.

Reference-contexts: For example, consider the closure M 0 0 of the 2 The proof in McKinsey is for first-order equational theories, and in fact led to the original definition of a Horn clause.

Obviously, it is as least as large as the set of characteristic models, and often much larger. 5 Furthermore, every Horn theory with K models over n variables can be represented using at most Kn 2 Horn clauses <ref> [ Dechter and Pearl, 1992 ] </ref> . Thus up to a small polynomial factor, the complete set of models is also always at least as large as the clausal representation. Neither of the other two representations strictly dominates the other. <p> This operation takes O (K 2 n) time, where K is the total number of models and n the number of variables. The clausal theory can be found using the algorithms described in <ref> [ Dechter and Pearl, 1992 ] </ref> and [ Kautz et al., to appear ] . 4 Deduction using Characteristic Models One of the most appealing features of Horn theories is that they allow for fast inference.

However, there is no apriori reason why a representation based on characteristic models would also enable fast inference. Nevertheless, in this section, we show that there is indeed a linear-time algorithm for deduction using characteristic models.

Reference-contexts: The size of S is O (2 n ). Moreover, one can show that there is no shorter clausal form for S, by using a proof very similar to the one in <ref> [ Kautz and Selman, 1992 ] </ref> , but the size of its set of characteristic models is polynomial in n. This can be seen as follows.

Reference-contexts: An example of the reaction against the traditional approach is the growing body of research and applications using case-based reasoning (CBR) <ref> [ Kolodner, 1991 ] </ref> . By identifying the notion of a case with that of a model, we can view the CBR enterprise as an attempt to bypass (or reduce) the use of logical formulas by storing and directly reasoning with a set of models.

Reference-contexts: This paper begins to provide a formal framework for understanding the success and limitations of some of the more empirical work in AI that use model-like representations. Earlier proposals to use models in formal inference, such as Levesque's proposal for vivid representations <ref> [ Levesque, 1986 ] </ref> , rely on using a single, database-like model, and thus have difficulty handling incomplete information. As we have seen, our approach is more general, because we represent a set of models.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Logical formulas are the traditional means of representing knowledge in formal AI systems <ref> [ McCarthy and Hayes, 1969 ] </ref> . The information implicit in a set of logical formulas can also be captured by expliciting recording the set of models (truth assignments) that satisfy the formulas. Indeed, standard databases are naturally viewed as representations of a single model.

Reference-contexts: Finally, using more sophisticated data structures we can bring the complexity down to truely linear time, O (jM j + jffj) [ Kautz et al., 1993 ] . 5 Abduction using Characteristic Models Another central reasoning task for intelligent systems is abduction, or inference to the best explanation <ref> [ Peirce, 1958 ] </ref> . In an abduction problem, one tries to explain an observation by selecting a set of assumptions that, together with other background knowledge, logically entail the observation. This kind of reasoning is central to many systems that perform diagnosis or interpretation, such as the ATMS.

Reference-contexts: Our approach is based on the idea of a Horn-strengthening, which we introduced in <ref> [ Selman and Kautz, 1991 ] </ref> . Definition: Horn-strengthening A Horn clause C H is a Horn-strengthening of a clause C iff C H is a Horn clause, C H subsumes C, and there is no other Horn clause that subsumes C and is subsumed by C H . <p> Further let C be any clause. Then S j= C iff there exists some Horn-strengthening C H of C such that C H evaluates to true in every model in M . Proof: Suppose S j= C. By Lemma 1 in <ref> [ Selman and Kautz, 1991 ] </ref> , S j= C H for some Horn-strengthening C H of C. So C evaluates to true in every model of S, and thus in every member of M . <p> None the less, it may be worthwhile to invest the effort to compile a useful Horn theory into 11 its set of characteristic models, just in case the latter representation does indeed turn out to be of reasonable size. This is an example of knowledge compilation <ref> [ Selman and Kautz, 1991 ] </ref> , where one is willing to invest a large amount of off-line effort in order to obtain fast run-time inference.
