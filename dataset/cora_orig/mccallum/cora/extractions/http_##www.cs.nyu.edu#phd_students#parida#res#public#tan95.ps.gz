Title: Common Tangents to Planar Parametric Curves: A Geometric Solution  
Author: Laxmi Parida S.P. Mudur

Abstract: The task of determining common tangent lines to a pair (or more) of parametric curves has important applications in draughting systems, enveloping polygon computation in bin-packing and compaction problems, and a host of other areas. In this paper, an efficient and robust algorithm to detect all common tangent lines between a pair of planar parametric curves has been presented. The algorithm uses a geometric search on the curves, and by quickly rejecting large portions that are not likely to have a common tangent, it rapidly zeroes-in to the solution. The algorithm has been implemented on an IBM PC compatible and works fast enough for real time interactive use.

Reference-contexts: Under isometric projection, cross-sections continue to be parametric curves and the silhouettes are straight lines tangential to these cross-sections. We have also encountered the use of common tangent lines to parametric curves in the high-level boundary evaluation of swept objects <ref> [1] </ref>, used as part of a font design system Vinyas [2,3], based on the brush trajectory approach [4]. In the high-level boundary evaluation method, the boundary is obtained by tracing the end points of the pen (i.e., the object being swept). <p> The reader may note that the two boundaries, corresponding to each end of the pen, are not necessarily translates of each other the pen may rotate as well as scale as it moves over the contour path (see Figure 3). <ref> [1] </ref> discusses in detail the sweep of an object over a contour and the subsequent evaluation of the boundary of such a region/volume description. We believe that methods for detection of common tangents to parametric curves have also other applications than the ones mentioned above.

Reference-contexts: Preprocessing The preprocessing can be divided into two steps: * partitioning of the curve, and * reparameterization of each partitioned piece. 3.1.1. Partitioning of the curve Definition 1: For a given bounded curve F (u); u 2 [u 0 ; u 1 ], F = <ref> [ 1 ; 2 ] </ref> is defined as the included tangent angle range, where 1 is the minimum (or maximum) of the slope angle of all tangents to the bounded curve F (u) and 2 is the maximum (or minimum) and 8 2 [ 1 ; 2 ], the curve has <p> 0 ; u 1 ], F = <ref> [ 1 ; 2 ] </ref> is defined as the included tangent angle range, where 1 is the minimum (or maximum) of the slope angle of all tangents to the bounded curve F (u) and 2 is the maximum (or minimum) and 8 2 [ 1 ; 2 ], the curve has at least one point with that tangent angle.

In the high-level boundary evaluation method, the boundary is obtained by tracing the end points of the pen (i.e., the object being swept). However, there is trouble when the two boundaries cross over as shown in Figure 2.

Reference-contexts: Notice that the inclusion of the common tangent line yields the correct boundary description. 3 Appeared in Computer-Aided Design, Vol 27, No. 1, pp. 41-47, January, 1995 tangent line computation for conics are cited in <ref> [6] </ref>. In this paper we present a robust and efficient algorithm for detecting the tangents to two planar curves defined in their parametric form. The algorithm uses a geometric search strategy and uses the divide and conquer paradigm. <p> The pair of equations could possibly give rise to (2n 1) 2 different solutions. For two cubic curves this is 25. But as has been seen in the case of common tangent lines to two circles <ref> [6] </ref>, many of them could possibly be complex or may lie outside the bounds of the given curve segments. The number of tangent lines will therefore depend on the actual shape characteristics of the two curves and their relative configuration.

Reference-contexts: It is at the core of a font design system, Vinyas, which uses a swept object model to implement the brush trajectory approach of defining strokes. The boundary is defined by a sequence of Bezier curves and linear segments. The typeface definition is produced in Type 3 Postscript format <ref> [7] </ref>. The implementation of the common tangent range detection, in the partitioning stage of the preprocessing step, needs a brief mention here. It may be noted that the tangent line with angle ff is coincident with the tangent line with angle + ff.

Reference-contexts: Each curve is partitioned into C-shaped pieces. This involves splitting the curve at the extremum points and inflection points of the curve <ref> [8] </ref>. All possible pairs of curves are then formed for searching for common tangent lines. It may be noted that for quadratic parametric curves, this step is not required. 2. Let F and G be the two curves in a pair of C-shaped curves resulting from step 1.
