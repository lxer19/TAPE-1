Abstract: Levin and Prince ( 1982 ) note that gapped sentences do not give rise to causal implicatures often associated with their nongapped counterparts. For instance, while (a) can have both a symmetric and asymmetric (causal) reading, the gapped version in (b) can only have the symmetric reading. We show that this fact falls out from a discourse processing architecture designed to account for VP-ellipsis data ( Kehler, 1993b ) . Evidence is given that VP-ellipsis requires a surface-syntactic antecedent in `parallel' constructions (e.g., symmetric `and') but only a suitable semantic antecedent in `non-parallel' constructions (e.g., asymmetric `and'). The architecture predicts that the syntactic gapping operation is unacceptable in those contexts where VP-ellipsis obtains semantic antecedents. This accords with the facts noticed by Levin and Prince as well as the lack of gapping in other non-parallel constructions.
