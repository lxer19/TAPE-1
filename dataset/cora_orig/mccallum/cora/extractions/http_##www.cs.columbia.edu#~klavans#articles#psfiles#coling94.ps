Abstract: This paper presents the results of an experiment using machine-readable dictionaries (MRDs) and corpora for building concatenative units for text to speech (TTS) systems. Theoretical questions concerning the nature of phonemic data in dictionaries are raised; phonemic dictionary data is viewed as a representative corpus over which to extract n- gram phonemic frequencies in the language. Dictionary data are compared to corpus data, and phoneme inventories are evaluated for coverage. A methodology is defined to compute phonemic n-grams for incorporation into a TTS system.

Reference-contexts: Thus, decisions on the use of MRD data depend on many factors, and can significantly impact efficiency and accuracy of a speech system. Since a dictionary entry consists of several fields of information, naturally, each will be useful for different applications <ref> [1] </ref>. Among the standard fields are pronunciation, etymology, subject field notes, definition fields, synonym and antonym cross references, semantic and syntactic comments, run-on forms, conjugational class and inflectional information where relevant, and translation for the bilingual dictionaries.

Reference-contexts: Since French liaison plays such an important role in the phonology of French, a look at phonetic data from a corpus must be given in order to achieve full coverage. A portion of the Hansard French corpus (over 2.3 million words) was used for this purpose. Grapheme-to-phoneme software <ref> [14] </ref> was utilized in order to convert French orthography into phonemes. For the sake of comparison, both the phonetic transcription from the corpus and the one from the MRD were converted into a unique set of phonemes. Typical output from the dictionary looks like: ABACA [abaka] n. m. <p> Thus, it could be argued that there is no need for the dictionary pronunciation, since with a complete and comprehensive grapheme-to-phoneme conversion system, a list which requires post-processing is simply inadequate and unnecessary. This is the approach taken, for example, by <ref> [14] </ref>, who makes use of small word lists (the main dictionary being 25K stored forms) and several affix tables to recognize graphemic forms, which are then transformed into phonemic representations; (b) only a small percentage of possible words are listed with pronunciations in a dictionary.

Reference-contexts: The most directly useful for TTS is the pronunciation field [4], [11]. Equally useful for TTS, but less directly acces sible, are data from run-on fields, conjugational class information, and part-of-speech. 1 To illustrate, the following partial entries from Webster's Seventh (W7) <ref> [15] </ref> illustrate typical pro nunciation, definition, and run-on fields: (1) ha.ven /qh.a-vn/ n 1: harbor, port 2 : a place of safety : asylum haven vt (2) bi.son /qb is-n, qb iz-/ n ... (3) ho.mo.ge.neous /-qje-ne-s, -nys/ ... (4) den.tic.u.late /den-qtik-y-lt/ or den.tic.u.lat.ed /-,lat-d/ adj The entry for "haven" contains

Reference-contexts: These forms can then be used as the input to the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion module in a Spanish TTS system. 2.3 Using Run-on's A run-on is defined as a morphological variant of a headword, included in the entry. Run-on's are problematic data in MRDs <ref> [16] </ref>, and they can be found nearly anywhere in the entry. In example (4), the run-on occurs at the beginning of the entry, and consists of a full form with suffix.

The phonemic string was split according to ten language-dependent segmentation principles.

Reference-contexts: In example (4), the run-on occurs at the beginning of the entry, and consists of a full form with suffix. More commonly, run-on's occur towards the end of the entry, and tend to consist of predictable suffixation, that is, class II or neutral suffixes <ref> [19] </ref> , such as -ness, -ly, or -er, as in: (7) sharp adj.... sharp.ly adv-sharp.ness n (8) suc.ces.sion n.... suc.ces.sion.al adj suc.ces.sion.al.ly adv In cases where stress is changed with class I non-neutral suffixes, a separate pronounciation is given as in: (9) gy.ro.scope /qj i-r-rskop/ n .... gy.ro.scop.ic /j i-r-qskap-ik/ adj
