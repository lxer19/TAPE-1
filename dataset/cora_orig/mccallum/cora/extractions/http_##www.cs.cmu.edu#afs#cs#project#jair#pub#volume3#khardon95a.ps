Abstract: Characteristic models are an alternative, model based, representation for Horn expressions. It has been shown that these two representations are incomparable and each has its advantages over the other. It is therefore natural to ask what is the cost of translating, back and forth, between these representations. Interestingly, the same translation questions arise in database theory, where it has applications to the design of relational databases. This paper studies the computational complexity of these problems. Our main result is that the two translation problems are equivalent under polynomial reductions, and that they are equivalent to the corresponding decision problem. Namely, translating is equivalent to deciding whether a given set of models is the set of characteristic models for a given Horn expression. We also relate these problems to the hypergraph transversal problem, a well known problem which is related to other applications in AI and for which no polynomial time algorithm is known. It is shown that in general our translation problems are at least as hard as the hypergraph transversal problem, and in a special case they are equivalent to it.

Reference-contexts: The function f 2 = x 1 x 2 : : : x m _ x 1 y 1 _ x 2 y 2 _ : : : _ x m y m <ref> (Aizenstein & Pitt, 1995) </ref> shows a gap between (1) and (2). (To observe that, notice the similarity between f 2 and the dual of the function from the previous sub-section.) Both functions are Horn (for f 2 by multiplying out we see that every clause for f is Horn, 4. <p> One caveat that we have to tackle is enumerating prime implicants after D is already equivalent to H. This can be done using "consensus" operations, which can generate all the prime implicants <ref> (Aizenstein & Pitt, 1995) </ref> 368 Horn Expressions and Characteristic Models although its Horn expression is large) and both have a small set of characteristic models. These examples show that enumeration of prime implicants may be an inefficient way for producing the characteristic models for some functions. 5.

Reference-contexts: As for (bd ! a), we would fail to find a proof and therefore conclude that it is not implied by W . This general approach is called theorem proving, and is efficient for Horn expressions <ref> (Dowling & Gallier, 1984) </ref>. An alternative approach is to check the implication relation by model checking. <p> In the first case we check whether H = H 0 (which can be done in polynomial time <ref> (Dowling & Gallier, 1984) </ref>) and answer accordingly. In the second case we know that the real Horn expression which corresponds to G is larger than H and therefore we answer No. 361 Khardon The proof of the next lemma draws on previous results in computational learning theory.

Reference-contexts: Examples in AI include computing abductive diagnoses (Re-iter, 1987), enumerating prime implicants in ATMS (Reiter & De Kleer, 1987), and Horn approximations (Kavvadias et al., 1993) which are closely related to characteristic models. Other areas include database theory (Mannila & Raiha, 1986), Boolean complexity, and distributed systems <ref> (Eiter & Gottlob, 1991) </ref>. A comprehensive study of these problems is presented by Eiter and Gottlob (1994). HTR is also equivalent to the problem of dual-ization of monotone Boolean expressions, which is the form in which we present it here. <p> Therefore, the algorithm presented by Fredman and Khachiyan (1994) can be used to solve CCM, and SID in time n O (log n) . This result can be alternatively derived from the results on functional dependencies in MAK form <ref> (Eiter & Gottlob, 1991) </ref>. We show however that our argument generalizes to the larger family of k-quasi Horn expressions. The second relaxation is the problem of computing all the prime implicants for a given Horn expression. <p> While no such reduction has been found, we show here that it holds in a special case. We show, however, that the solution obtained in this way may need exponential time in the general case. This result has already been obtained in the database domain <ref> (Eiter & Gottlob, 1991) </ref>, where restrictions of functional dependencies to be in MAK form is discussed.

Reference-contexts: The complexity of the HTR problem has been studied before (Fredman & Khachiyan, 1994; Eiter & Gottlob, 1994; Kavvadias et al., 1993) and is still an open question. On one hand a class of problems which are "HTR complete" has been defined and studied <ref> (Eiter & Gottlob, 1994) </ref>. This class includes many problems from various application areas which are equivalent to HTR (under polynomial reductions). On the other hand the problem is probably not NP-Complete. Recently, Fredman and Khachiyan (1994) have presented a sub-exponential n O (log n) time algorithm for the HTR problem. <p> Namely, how a decision procedure for satisfiability can be used to construct an algorithm that finds a satisfying assignment if one exists. Suppose 1. Other related notions which we do not use here are "enumeration with polynomial delay" and "enumeration with incremental polynomial delay" <ref> (Eiter & Gottlob, 1994) </ref>. These require that the algorithm will compute the elements of its output one at a time, and restrict the time delay between consecutive outputs. Incremental polynomial delay allows the delay to depend on the problem size and on the number of elements computed so far. <p> In each iteration we run CMIC on H; G to get a new characteristic model which we add to G. Once we find all the characteristic models CMIC will answer Yes. (In fact, if CMIC is polynomial in its input size then we get an "incremental polynomial algorithm" <ref> (Eiter & Gottlob, 1994) </ref> which is even stronger than "output polynomial" as required here.) 4. The Relation to Hypergraph Transversals In this section we establish the relation to the hypergraph transversal problem. We first show that our problems are at least as hard as HTR.

Reference-contexts: The second relaxation is the problem of computing all the prime implicants for a given Horn expression. This is a relaxation of CCM since using the prime implicants one can compute the characteristic models. Interestingly, the algorithm for HTR <ref> (Fredman & Khachiyan, 1994) </ref> can be adapted to this problem, resulting an algorithm with time complexity n O (log 2 n) . <p> We consider this problem here. Namely, we consider the problem of enumerating all the prime implicants of a Horn expression, and its application for the solution of CCM. While we have not found a general reduction from this problem to HTR, a simple adaption of the algorithm for HTR <ref> (Fredman & Khachiyan, 1994) </ref> yields an incremental n O (log 2 n) algorithm for this problem. However, as we discuss below, enumeration of prime implicants of a Horn expression is not sufficient for solving CCM. <p> The algorithm finds an assignment x which satisfies H and does not satisfy D. Using x it is easy to find a new prime implicant of H. The algorithm to find x uses the following combinatorial fact <ref> (Fredman & Khachiyan, 1994) </ref>: either there is a variable x i that appears in H ^ D with high frequency, or the expression H ^ D has "a lot" of satisfying assignments.

Reference-contexts: We note that for SID the output is not uniquely defined since there is no unique minimal representation for Horn functions. We define polynomial reductions with respect to an oracle (i.e. we use Turing reducibility <ref> (Garey & Johnson, 1979) </ref>). A problem P1 is polynomially reducible to a problem P2 if there is an output polynomial algorithm that solves P1 when given access to (1) an output polynomial subroutine for P2, and (2) a polynomial bound 2 on the running time of the subroutine. 3. <p> Lemma 1 The problem CMIC is polynomially reducible to the problem CMI. Before presenting the proof consider how a similar result is achieved for the satisfiability problem <ref> (Garey & Johnson, 1979) </ref>. Namely, how a decision procedure for satisfiability can be used to construct an algorithm that finds a satisfying assignment if one exists. Suppose 1. <p> Theorem 12 The decision problem EOC is co-NP-Complete. Proof: The problem is trivially in co-NP (guess an assignment x and say "No" if x 2 H n closure (G)). To show its hardness we reduce co-Monotone 3-SAT to EOC. Monotone 3-SAT <ref> (Garey & Johnson, 1979) </ref> is the problem of satisfiability of CNF formulas in which in every clause (has 3 literals and) either all the literals are positive (we call these clauses monotone) or all the literals are negated (we call such clauses anti-monotone).

Reference-contexts: This problem is shown to be co-NP-Complete. This serves to highlight some of the difficulty in finding the exact complexity of our problems. A variant of this result, has already appeared in the database literature <ref> (Gottlob & Libkin, 1990) </ref>. 352 Horn Expressions and Characteristic Models Our results are summarized in Figure 1, where a hierarchy of problems is depicted. The problem EOC is co-NP-Complete. The problem CMI is a special case of EOC, and is equivalent to SID and CCM.

Reference-contexts: The characteristic models of Horn formulas have been shown to be useful. There is a linear time deduction algorithm using this set, and abduction can be performed in polynomial time, while using formulas it is NP-Hard <ref> (Kautz et al., 1995) </ref>. Furthermore, an algorithm for default reasoning using characteristic models has been developed, for cases where formula based algorithms are not known (Khardon & Roth, 1995). <p> Model checking with this set is guaranteed to produce correct results for any ff which is a Horn expression, and using a slightly more complicated algorithm one can answer correctly for every ff <ref> (Kautz et al., 1995) </ref>. In our example, it is easy to check that (cd ! a) is evaluated to "truth" on all the assignments in char (W ) and that (bd ! a) is falsified by 0101. The utility of these representations, Horn expressions and characteristic models, is not comparable. <p> First, the size of these representations is incomparable. There are short Horn expressions for which the set of characteristic models is of exponential size, and vice versa, there are also exponential size Horn expressions for which the set of characteristic models is small <ref> (Kautz et al., 1995) </ref>. The representations also differ in the services which they support. On one hand, Horn expressions are more comprehensible. On the other hand characteristic models are advantageous in that they allow for efficient algorithms for abduction and default reasoning. <p> Therefore, it is appropriate to ask whether there are algorithms which can perform the above tasks in time which is polynomial in both the input size and the output size. These are called output polynomial algorithms. Before starting our investigation we note that it has been shown <ref> (Kautz et al., 1995) </ref> that using the set of characteristic models one can answer abduction queries related to H in polynomial time, while given the formula H it is NP-Hard to perform abduction (Selman & Levesque, 1990).

This section explores the relations between the monotone theory and characteristic models.

For example, they have unique minimal DNF and CNF representations. Another property is that the minimal assignment which corresponds to every term is indeed part of the set min b (f ). Claim 1 <ref> (Khardon & Roth, 1994) </ref> For any b-monotone function f , there is a 1-1 correspondence between the prime implicants of f and the set min b (f ). <p> Given f 2 F we say that g 2 G is a G-least upper bound of f if and only if f g and there is no f 0 2 G such that f f 0 g. 357 Khardon Theorem 4 <ref> (Khardon & Roth, 1994) </ref> Let f be any Boolean function and G a class of all Boolean functions with basis B. Then, f B lub defined as f B ^ M b (f ) is the G-least upper bound of f . <p> If the answer is No, for some i, we can proceed to the next stage, just as before (ignoring tests for other values of i).

Reference-contexts: The HTR problem has a lot of equivalent manifestations which appear in various branches of computer science. Examples in AI include computing abductive diagnoses (Re-iter, 1987), enumerating prime implicants in ATMS <ref> (Reiter & De Kleer, 1987) </ref>, and Horn approximations (Kavvadias et al., 1993) which are closely related to characteristic models. Other areas include database theory (Mannila & Raiha, 1986), Boolean complexity, and distributed systems (Eiter & Gottlob, 1991). A comprehensive study of these problems is presented by Eiter and Gottlob (1994).

Reference-contexts: We would also use the notion of a least upper bound of a Boolean function <ref> (Selman & Kautz, 1991) </ref>, which can sometimes be characterized by the monotone theory. Definition 3 (Least Upper-bound) Let F ; G be classes of Boolean functions.

Reference-contexts: Before starting our investigation we note that it has been shown (Kautz et al., 1995) that using the set of characteristic models one can answer abduction queries related to H in polynomial time, while given the formula H it is NP-Hard to perform abduction <ref> (Selman & Levesque, 1990) </ref>. This however does not imply that computing the set of characteristic models is NP-Hard since the construction in the proof yields a Horn formula whose set of characteristic models is of exponential size.
