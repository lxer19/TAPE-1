Title: Protein Folding in the Hydrophobic-Polar Model on the 3D Triangular Lattice  
Author: Scott E. Decatur Serafim Batzoglou 
Affiliation: MIT Laboratory for Computer Science  
Abstract: We consider the problem of determining the three-dimensional folding of a protein given its one-dimensional amino acid sequence. The model we use is based on the Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) model [1] on cubic lattices in which the goal is to find the fold with the maximum number of contacts between non-covalently linked hydrophobic amino acids. Hart and Istrail [3] give a 3/8 approximation algorithm for folding proteins on the cubic lattice. Since the cubic lattice exhibits the parity problem (described below), we instead consider folding proteins on a different lattice: the 3D triangular lattice. We show a simple linear time algorithm which achieves a 16/30 asymptotic approximation. We briefly sketch a more sophisticated (but still linear time) algorithm which achieves a 62/105 factor of optimal.

Reference-contexts: The goal is to find a fold of the protein which has the highest possible score. It is not known whether or not this problem is NP-hard. Hart and Istrail <ref> [3] </ref> give an algorithm for generating folds on a cubic lattice such that for any protein, the score of their fold is at least 3=8 of the optimal score for this protein on a cubic lattice.
