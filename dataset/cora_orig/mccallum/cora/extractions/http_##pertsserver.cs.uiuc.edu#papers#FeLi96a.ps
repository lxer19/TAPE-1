Abstract: B-ISDN provides communication services with different requirements. In particular, real-time communication services must meet certain timing requirements: end-to-end delay and delay jitter. When the network is congested, the end-to-end delay may exceed its maximum allowed value, and the delay jitter may be intolerable. Fortunately, many real-time services can trade service quality for information timeliness; this tradeoff is the basis for applying the imprecise-computation technique to real-time communication services. Keywords: multimedia networks, broadband & ATM networks, and imprecise computation.

Reference-contexts: Bursts of traffic can temporarily saturate a switching node, causing network congestion. Consequently, packets may fail to meet their timing requirements, and packets may be lost due to buffer overflow at an ATM switch. Chipalkatti et al. and Huang et al. <ref> [1, 2] </ref> allow the network designer to explicitly tradeoff real-time packet loss for non-real-time packet delay by applying queue-length thresholding (QLT) on the non-real-time queue. We present a congestion control scheme that couples the imprecise-computation technique with a version of QLT on the real-time queues.

Reference-contexts: To help ensure that non-real-time packets are not lost and that the average response time of the non-real-time packets is relatively low and has a small variance, a periodic server is used <ref> [3] </ref>. 2 Congestion Control With real-time communication services, an end user may prefer to sacrifice the quality of a result for timeliness. For instance, during a video transmission, displaying a few low-quality frames is better than not having a frame to display when it needs to be displayed. <p> Real-time packets are scheduled according to the earliest-deadline-first algorithm [4, 5]. Whenever the output link is free, the packet with the nearest absolute deadline is transmitted next. Non-real-time packets in the data subbuffer are transmitted on a first-come, first-serve basis. A periodic server <ref> [3] </ref> is used to ensure that at least a minimum number of non-real-time traffic packets are transmitted during each of its periods when there are packets in the data subbuffer. A periodic server is defined by its period and the percentage of bandwidth that it reserves for non-real-time packets.

Reference-contexts: Data packets are considered to be non-real-time, and thus their relative deadlines are theoretically infinite; but we want data packets to have short delays on the average. The scheduling policy for the output system is non-preemptive. Real-time packets are scheduled according to the earliest-deadline-first algorithm <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. Whenever the output link is free, the packet with the nearest absolute deadline is transmitted next. Non-real-time packets in the data subbuffer are transmitted on a first-come, first-serve basis.

Reference-contexts: A traffic load consists of a background load and a foreground load. Each experiment starts with a background load and then gradually adds connections as part of the foreground load, until the link reaches full utilization. As in <ref> [6] </ref>, our background load consists of 20 videotelephone connections, 1000 telephone connections, and 13 data connections, where the average data rate on each of these connections is 1.28 Mbps, 25.175 kbps, and 1 Mbps, respectively [7, 8]. The background load by itself results in a total link utilization of 37.4%. <p> The background load by itself results in a total link utilization of 37.4%. Our foreground load consists of either statistical H.261 video connections or actual MPEG video connections. When an actual MPEG video is required for the foreground load, the Late Show with David Letterman is used. Based on <ref> [6, 9] </ref>, we fix the remaining parameters as follows: The relative deadlines of video and voice packets are set at 1 and 2 ms, respectively. The imprecision ratio is the number of mandatory packets to optional packets. For videotelephone and telephone traffic, the ratio is set to 1:1.
