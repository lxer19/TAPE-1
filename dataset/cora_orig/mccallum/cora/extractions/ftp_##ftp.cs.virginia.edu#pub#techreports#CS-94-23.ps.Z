Reference-contexts: The ratio of parity bits to total bits is known as the degree of overcoding for the code. Forward error correction is often identified with transmission-media level error handling. In the language of coding theory <ref> [3] </ref>, an error is defined as a corrupted bit (or symbol) with an unknown value in an unknown location. An erasure is a corrupted bit (or symbol) with an unknown value in a known location.

Reference-contexts: The parameter k is variable. Packet loss in the network results from congestion. The increase in bandwidth due to FEC overcoding adds to network traffic and therefore increases congestion. Thus, the use of forward error correction causes additional packet losses in the network. In <ref> [4] </ref>, this trade-off between loss recovery and additional loss is studied using the Reed-Solomon burst erasure code just described. The network model is an ATM multiplexer with a set of 32 statistical sources. Sources are of two types, bulk sources representing bulk data transfers, or video sources representing video streams.

Reference-contexts: In addition to protocols specific to the delivery of continuous media data [43], emerging general-purpose transport protocols such as XTP [57] and TP++ <ref> [5] </ref> are experimenting with novel error control mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: Resynchronization points in the continuous media stream allow the jitter buffer to be maintained. A voice stream, for example, consists of an alternating series of speech activity periods, or talkspurts, and silence periods <ref> [6] </ref>. The natural resynchronization point in the stream is at each talkspurt boundary, and studies have shown that in general the adjustment of the playback of a talkspurt can be as much as 50% of the duration of the following silence period without affecting the quality of the playback [62]. <p> The tolerance of packet voice for playback adjustment assumes that talkspurts are generally isolated from each other by relatively long silence periods, a property reported in empirical studies <ref> [6, 8] </ref>. To ensure this isolation, voice protocols enforce a minimum intertalkspurt time, or hangover time, when marking talkspurt boundaries [24]. 1.1.4 Error Control In a packet-switched network end-to-end protocols may need to protect the client from the misordering, duplication, corruption, and loss of packets in the network. <p> Note, however, that the the control time cannot be arbitrarily large due to constraints on the end-to-end delay. Since voice data consists of an alternating series of talkspurts and silence periods and since talkspurts are 26 generally isolated from each other by relatively long silence periods <ref> [6, 8] </ref>, voice protocols typically impose the control time on the first packet of each talkspurt.

Reference-contexts: Integrated services networks, however, will use packet-based transport for digital voice and video services since packet-switching utilizes network resources more efficiently than circuit switching. The statistical multiplexing of packets exploits the fact that voice and video are inherently variable rate sources <ref> [7, 33] </ref>. The potential gain in efficiency is significant. Studies show 20-30% of the time in a voice conversation consists of silence [7], and the peak-to-mean ratio of variable-rate video is typically in the range of 1.5 to 4.5 [20]. <p> The statistical multiplexing of packets exploits the fact that voice and video are inherently variable rate sources [7, 33].

The packetization interval, T x , determines the duration of speech (in milliseconds) captured by each network packet.

Reference-contexts: An erasure is a corrupted bit (or symbol) with an unknown value in a known location. Most extant error correction schemes were designed to detect and/or correct random errors in a bit stream that exist in unknown locations, e.g. for noisy media such as satellite or wireless links <ref> [9, 32, 37] </ref>. Fiber-optic packet-switched computer networks require a different error model. While random errors are rare, losses occur on packet boundaries (burst erasures), and thus burst erasure correcting codes are the appropriate form of forward error correction for these environments.

Reference-contexts: In general, high-quality voice applications require less than 200 ms roundtrip delays, but delays of up to 600 ms have been shown to be acceptable [35]. Recent guidelines from CCITT suggest that even roundtrip delays of up to 800 ms have a limited impact on quality <ref> [10] </ref>. The requirement for bounded roundtrip delay is generally translated into a requirement for the network to bound the one-way end-to-end network delay. End-to-end delay guarantees are not generally available in current packet-based networks.

Reference-contexts: Of particular importance is the highly visible effort by the international telephony standards body, CCITT, to standardize a high-speed integrated services network architecture known as Broadband ISDN, with its underlying packet-switched transport, the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology <ref> [11] </ref>. Broadband ISDN will enable high-speed delivery of digital continuous media over wide-area networks. Conventional networks for continuous media are based on circuit-switched technology since circuit-switching allows for careful control of loss and delay. <p> In Example 4 we consider the effects of reducing the packetization interval and subsequently increasing the number of packets in a talkspurt. A motivation for Example 4 is the consideration of our retransmission scheme in 50 an ATM adaptation layer protocol <ref> [11] </ref>, instead of an upper layer protocol. 4.3.1 Example 1: Effects of the Control Time on Retransmission Recall that in our end-to-end model, we specify a single error period during the transmission of a talkspurt, but multiple consecutive packets can be lost during the error period.

Reference-contexts: One conclusion of the study is that the number of sources in a network using FEC may have to be limited in order for the effect to be significant. 2.2.2 Hybrid FEC/ARQ Many hybrid schemes in which forward error correction is combined with the use of retrans-missions have been studied <ref> [12, 32, 49] </ref>, though only in the context of channel efficiency, and not for delay-constrained communication. Under these schemes the receiver uses the parity bits in forward error correction to recover from losses, but when there are too many errors a retransmission is requested from the transmitter. <p> The retransmission may be the original message [32] or additional parity bits that will allow recovery of the original message <ref> [12] </ref>. 18 Hybrid schemes can be effective in reducing the bandwidth consumed through over--coding since larger losses can be recovered through retransmissions. Overall performance of the error recovery mechanisms as measured in terms of average throughput is generally superior to pure FEC or pure ARQ [32, 49].

Reference-contexts: In Section 3.3 we state our conclusions from this study. 3.1 Slack ARQ Experiments with the transmission of packetized digital speech across computer networks date to the earliest days of packet-switching, with a network voice protocol (NVP) for the 25 Internet having been specified in 1976 <ref> [13] </ref>. The feasibility of high-quality voice transmis-sion for large numbers of users has dramatically risen in the past five years with the advent of high-speed LANs and powerful desktop computers with audio hardware as a standard feature. Protocols and conferencing tools have become available for multiple-party connections.

Reference-contexts: Data in a higher layer packet is typically one or two orders of magnitude more than in the payload of an ATM cell, e.g., the current IP over ATM proposal has a maximum transmission unit (MTU) of 9000 bytes <ref> [14] </ref>, while the payload of an ATM cell is at most 48 bytes. The implication is that very low loss rates at the ATM level can translate into relatively high observed loss rates for applications. This conflict is fundamental to the design of ATM networks.

Reference-contexts: The service provides sequenced delivery with the full functionality of an XTP association, e.g., rate control, an out-of-band data channel, and multicast, but with error control disabled. In <ref> [15] </ref> a new XTP service for Partially Error-Controlled Connections (PECC) is proposed that generalizes the no-error mode service to allow for application-specific parameterization of the underlying XTP error control algorithm.

Reference-contexts: As 9 researchers in the Internet community have begun to experiment with emerging applications such as continuous media, remarks such as the following conclusion reached at the 1991 Joint SIGGRAPH/SIGCOMM Workshop on Graphics and Networking <ref> [16] </ref> are representative: TCP may not provide sufficient performance in some applications and does not support a rich enough set of quality of service.

Reference-contexts: Our data suggests that at least some increased delays are related to periodic router behavior, which would correlate with observations in <ref> [17, 44] </ref>, though this periodic behavior does not explain all the high delays observed. Packet losses are rare, but they do occur in the experiments. All losses that were observed are isolated single-packet losses.

Reference-contexts: Standards for digital representations are important for widespread acceptance. International standards for audio, images, and video have emerged in recent years, but standards continue to evolve as new techniques push the state-of-the-art in the coding and compression of audiovisual information <ref> [19] </ref>. At the present time (c. 1994) audio and video hardware is increasingly common in desktop computers, and the experience base for creating and using 1 Continuous media refers to the fact that audio and video are fundamentally analog data types.

Reference-contexts: The potential gain in efficiency is significant. Studies show 20-30% of the time in a voice conversation consists of silence [7], and the peak-to-mean ratio of variable-rate video is typically in the range of 1.5 to 4.5 <ref> [20] </ref>. Accommodation of continuous media streams in packet-switched networks represents a tremendous technical challenge. <p> Specifically, in networks such as ATM networks, the channel carrying the most significant components can be given higher priority in the network when congestion forces packet discard. In the context of ATM networks, a number of techniques have been proposed <ref> [20, 33, 55, 63] </ref> to split signals into separate channels and use priority channels in controlling quality degradation due to network loss. For example, one study on voice [58] has investigated a least significant bit LSB dropping scheme. <p> These results assume a packet size of 32 bytes, or 4 ms for PCM and 8 ms for ADPCM. In <ref> [20] </ref> a detailed investigation of a two-priority network model is presented using simulations with actual Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) encoded voice and video as input. <p> This functionality is not available in current LANs, and its implementation cost in high-speed cell switches is of unknown complexity at this time. The methods of <ref> [20] </ref> assume a time-out driven loss mechanism at the internal network queues, which requires sequential checking or sorting of the packets by a time-to-live field.

Reference-contexts: These variations are referred to as delay jitter. Delay jitter can lead to interruptions in the continuous playback at the receiver of the continuous media stream. Current packet-switched networks do not provide jitter control in the network, though 5 there are proposals in the literature to do so <ref> [21, 61] </ref>. Jitter control in the network would relieve end-to-end protocols of delay jitter concerns, simplifying buffering and synchronization. Jitter control, however, implies per-packet processing at internal network nodes that estimates the delay bounds of packets and artificially delays any packets that are progressing too quickly through the network. <p> In our work we assume no performance guarantees from the network. If performance guarantees from the network are available, however, they can simplify the construction of end-to-end protocol mechanisms that we propose. While it may be possible to engineer packet-switched networks to emulate the near-zero loss characteristic of circuit-switching <ref> [21] </ref>, the loss of efficiency in the network will likely be too costly. It follows that end-to-end error control will always have a place in the network architecture, even if QOS networks become ubiquitous.

Reference-contexts: Data stream events, e.g., a packet arriving out-of-order, trigger retransmission requests. For robustness the receiver uses an additional timer to detect very long burst losses during which no subsequent packets will arrive to enable loss detection. The analysis in <ref> [22] </ref> characterizes the AOEC protocol in terms of average end-to-end delay of a segment, maximum end-to-end delay of a segment, and average throughput for a stream.

Reference-contexts: A more complete description of PECC, its implementation, and experimental results are given in Appendix A of this thesis. 2.3.2 Application-Oriented Error Control The application-oriented error control (AOEC) presented in <ref> [23] </ref> has the objective of satisfying an application's error tolerance with minimum retransmission overhead. Like the PECC service, an application using the AOEC service interface gives a description of its maximum error tolerance that parametrizes retransmission decisions in the protocol.

Reference-contexts: The tolerance of packet voice for playback adjustment assumes that talkspurts are generally isolated from each other by relatively long silence periods, a property reported in empirical studies [6, 8]. To ensure this isolation, voice protocols enforce a minimum intertalkspurt time, or hangover time, when marking talkspurt boundaries <ref> [24] </ref>. 1.1.4 Error Control In a packet-switched network end-to-end protocols may need to protect the client from the misordering, duplication, corruption, and loss of packets in the network. Continuous media 6 streams require protection from misordering since the data stream carries time-ordered information. <p> Subsequent increases in the hangover time cause a more gradual increase in the duration of talkspurts and silence periods. We conclude that, to achieve silence periods of relatively long durations (i.e., 250-300 ms), a hangover time of approximately 100 ms is necessary, in line with <ref> [24] </ref>. voice stream leaving the traffic-generating workstation. In line with the analytical model, the figure shows that the packetization interval generally dominates protocol processing at the transmitter.

Reference-contexts: The frequency distribution for the number of packets in a talkspurt is given in Figure 5.9. the empirical data demonstrates a high variance in the number of packets, with many talkspurts containing less than ten packets. This behavior is corroborated in <ref> [25] </ref>. 71 This distribution improves the likelihood of continuous playback for a talkspurt since the probability of a jitter gap is reduced by having fewer packets in the talkspurt.

Reference-contexts: The trend toward low-bit-rate encodings implies an increased importance on reliable delivery, though many extant protocols for continuous media <ref> [26, 43, 50, 59] </ref> do not provide any form of end-to-end error control. It is important to recognize that error control in this context is fundamentally different from error control for data transfers. <p> Protocols and conferencing tools have become available for multiple-party connections. Examples of software from the research community include NVP, the vat protocol <ref> [26] </ref>, and the NEVOT audioconferencing tool [50]. In a local area network, delay and delay jitter is introduced by variable network access delay, operating system scheduling, and protocol processing at the endsystems as well as congested store-and-forward routers if the network has multiple segments.

Reference-contexts: The issues are encoding schemes, end-to-end network delays, network delay variations, and errors. 1.1.1 Encoding In recent years considerable progress has been made in the design of efficient techniques for digital encoding of analog audiovisual data <ref> [28] </ref>. When distributed across a network, the quality of the reconstructed signal at the receiving site depends on the encoding scheme and the distortions introduced by network imperfections. <p> In most applications this quality is ultimately judged by a human receiver and hence subjective metrics linked to human perception factors are used. Performance criteria for encoding schemes include efficiency, sampling rate, complexity, and processing time <ref> [28] </ref>. The digital encoding of an analog signal involves sampling the signal with a certain period, known as the sampling rate. Efficiency is measured as the number of bits used per sample to represent the signal. <p> Video sampling rates are often expressed in millions of pixels per second (Mp/s). One encoding for High Definition Television (HDTV) specifies resolution of 1280 pixels by 720 pixels with 60 frame/s to yield a sampling rate of 60 Mp/s <ref> [28] </ref>. <p> Uniform quantization at 8-24 bits/pixel yields enormous bandwidths and is therefore seldom used. In <ref> [28] </ref>, state-of-the-art signal processing and compression techniques are estimated to generate on average much less than one bit/pixel/s for good quality video. The sampling rate and efficiency of an encoding scheme determine the bandwidth required for network distribution.

Reference-contexts: An erasure is a corrupted bit (or symbol) with an unknown value in a known location. Most extant error correction schemes were designed to detect and/or correct random errors in a bit stream that exist in unknown locations, e.g. for noisy media such as satellite or wireless links <ref> [9, 32, 37] </ref>. Fiber-optic packet-switched computer networks require a different error model. While random errors are rare, losses occur on packet boundaries (burst erasures), and thus burst erasure correcting codes are the appropriate form of forward error correction for these environments. <p> One conclusion of the study is that the number of sources in a network using FEC may have to be limited in order for the effect to be significant. 2.2.2 Hybrid FEC/ARQ Many hybrid schemes in which forward error correction is combined with the use of retrans-missions have been studied <ref> [12, 32, 49] </ref>, though only in the context of channel efficiency, and not for delay-constrained communication. Under these schemes the receiver uses the parity bits in forward error correction to recover from losses, but when there are too many errors a retransmission is requested from the transmitter. <p> Under these schemes the receiver uses the parity bits in forward error correction to recover from losses, but when there are too many errors a retransmission is requested from the transmitter. The retransmission may be the original message <ref> [32] </ref> or additional parity bits that will allow recovery of the original message [12]. 18 Hybrid schemes can be effective in reducing the bandwidth consumed through over--coding since larger losses can be recovered through retransmissions. <p> Overall performance of the error recovery mechanisms as measured in terms of average throughput is generally superior to pure FEC or pure ARQ <ref> [32, 49] </ref>. The drawbacks of hybrid FEC/ARQ are the requirement for FEC hardware and the complexity of coordinating the retransmission scheme with the FEC hardware.

Reference-contexts: Integrated services networks, however, will use packet-based transport for digital voice and video services since packet-switching utilizes network resources more efficiently than circuit switching. The statistical multiplexing of packets exploits the fact that voice and video are inherently variable rate sources <ref> [7, 33] </ref>. The potential gain in efficiency is significant. Studies show 20-30% of the time in a voice conversation consists of silence [7], and the peak-to-mean ratio of variable-rate video is typically in the range of 1.5 to 4.5 [20]. <p> document is synonymous with packet loss control. 2.2 Open-Loop Error Control Much research has been focused on open-loop techniques that recover or limit the effects of packet losses during continuous media transfers without the roundtrip network delays associated with retransmission-based error control. 2.2.1 Forward Error Correction Forward error correction (FEC) <ref> [33, 47] </ref> provides robustness in the presence of packet losses by adding redundant information to the original data stream. If only a small number of packets is lost, the added redundancy enables a reconstruction of the original data at the receiver. There are two types of error correction codes [39]. <p> Channel coding techniques generally exploit the hierarchy of data importance created by embedded or layered encoding, which are techniques that produce successive approximations to a signal. Examples include sub-band, pyramid, and transform coding <ref> [30, 33] </ref>. Signal components that contribute relatively little are sent with low priority in the network 19 while important signal components are given preference in the network. <p> Specifically, in networks such as ATM networks, the channel carrying the most significant components can be given higher priority in the network when congestion forces packet discard. In the context of ATM networks, a number of techniques have been proposed <ref> [20, 33, 55, 63] </ref> to split signals into separate channels and use priority channels in controlling quality degradation due to network loss. For example, one study on voice [58] has investigated a least significant bit LSB dropping scheme.

In general, high-quality voice applications require less than 200 ms roundtrip delays, but delays of up to 600 ms have been shown to be acceptable <ref> [35] </ref>. Recent guidelines from CCITT suggest that even roundtrip delays of up to 800 ms have a limited impact on quality [10]. The requirement for bounded roundtrip delay is generally translated into a requirement for the network to bound the one-way end-to-end network delay.

Reference-contexts: If only a small number of packets is lost, the added redundancy enables a reconstruction of the original data at the receiver. There are two types of error correction codes <ref> [39] </ref>. A block code divides a message into coding blocks, containing both information and parities. These parities allow the receiver to reconstruct the information content of a block correctly, provided enough of the block gets 16 through uncorrupted.

Reference-contexts: These variations are referred to as delay jitter. Delay jitter can lead to interruptions in the continuous playback at the receiver of the continuous media stream. Current packet-switched networks do not provide jitter control in the network, though 5 there are proposals in the literature to do so <ref> [21, 61] </ref>. Jitter control in the network would relieve end-to-end protocols of delay jitter concerns, simplifying buffering and synchronization. Jitter control, however, implies per-packet processing at internal network nodes that estimates the delay bounds of packets and artificially delays any packets that are progressing too quickly through the network.

Reference-contexts: The natural resynchronization point in the stream is at each talkspurt boundary, and studies have shown that in general the adjustment of the playback of a talkspurt can be as much as 50% of the duration of the following silence period without affecting the quality of the playback <ref> [62] </ref>. The tolerance of packet voice for playback adjustment assumes that talkspurts are generally isolated from each other by relatively long silence periods, a property reported in empirical studies [6, 8].

Reference-contexts: Specifically, in networks such as ATM networks, the channel carrying the most significant components can be given higher priority in the network when congestion forces packet discard. In the context of ATM networks, a number of techniques have been proposed <ref> [20, 33, 55, 63] </ref> to split signals into separate channels and use priority channels in controlling quality degradation due to network loss. For example, one study on voice [58] has investigated a least significant bit LSB dropping scheme.

Reference-contexts: While deployment of first-generation QOS networks is imminent, the nature of supportable network performance guarantees is as yet uncertain. Many critical issues regarding quality of service networking are open research questions, and a variety of experimental techniques have been put forth, as surveyed in <ref> [36, 64] </ref>. Our work concerns the design of end-to-end error control. The demand for continuous media applications is developing much faster than the design and deployment of integrated service networks. There will thus continue to be considerable interest in the distribution of continuous media streams across conventional networking technologies.
