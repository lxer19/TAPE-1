Abstract: desired target state, an estimate is as follows. For a fixed ball around the origin, and sufficient smoothness, one can see that h = O(") provides the inequality in (10), as required for (12). Thus, the number of iterations N needed, using such a stepsize, is obtained from (11): (1 c") N &lt; " where c is a constant. Taking logarithms and using log(1 x) = x + o(x) there results the rough estimate N = O 1 alytic) if it is infinitely differentiable (respectively, real-analytic) as a function of t 2 [0; T ]. As before, we denote by (t; x; !) the solution of (1) at time t with initial condition x and control !. This is defined for all small t = t(x; !) &gt; 0; when we write (; x; !), we mean the solution as defined on the largest interval [0; t ) of existence. all t 2 [0; T 0 ], we may consider the linearization along @f for each t. A control ! will be said to be nonsingular for x if the linear time-varying system (23) is controllable on the interval [0; T 0 ], for some T 0 &gt; 0. When u is analytic, this property is independent of the particular T 0 chosen, and it is equivalent to a Kalman-like rank condition (see e.g. [6], Corollary 3.5.17). Nonsingularity is equivalent to a Frechet derivative of (T 0 ; x; ) having full rank at !. If ! is nonsingular for x 2 X , and T 0 is as above, then the rechability set in time T 0 from x has a nonempty interior. This is a trivial consequence of the Implicit Function Theorem (see for instance [6], Theorem 6). Thus, if for each state x there is some control which is nonsin-gular for x, then (1) is strongly accessible. The converse of this fact is also true, that is, if a system is strongly accessible then for each state x there is some control which is nonsingular for x. This converse fact was already known. The main purpose here is to point out that ! can be chosen independently of the particular x, and moreover, a generic ! has this property. We now give a precise statement of these facts. Theorem 2 If (1) is strongly accessible, the set of smooth universal nonsingular controls is generic in C 1 ([0; T ]; U ), for any T &gt; 0. The proof is given [7], and is heavily based on Suss-mann's universal input theorem, see [9]. This in turn generalized a weaker result in [5], which would have given only Theorem 1 for compact X ; see also this spe cial case in [10], Lemma 4.10).
