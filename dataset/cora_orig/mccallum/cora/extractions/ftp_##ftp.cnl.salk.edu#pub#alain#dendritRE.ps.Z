Reference-contexts: First, RE cells typically produce broad bursts which develop more slowly than in TC cells (Mulle et al., 1986; Steriade et al., 1986; Llinas and Geijo-Barrientos, 1988). This is corroborated by the slower activation and inactivation kinetics of the T-current in these neurons <ref> (Huguenard and Prince, 1992) </ref>. Second, relatively strong current pulses need to be injected to evoke bursts in RE cells compared to TC cells (Mulle et al., 1986; Bal and McCormick, 1993; Contreras et al., 1993), suggesting that I T s might be located in the dendrites. <p> The two equivalent cable models studied had either 80 or 230 compartments and gave identical results. In acutely dissociated cells, most of the dendritic arborizations were removed by the dissociation procedure <ref> (see Fig. 2 of Huguenard and Prince, 1992) </ref>. Simulations of acutely dissociated RE cells used a cable geometry obtained by truncating the dendrites of the original cell (Fig. 1B). <p> The model shown in Fig. 1B had only the soma and the most proximal parts of dendrites (8 compartments), with a total membrane area of 3639 m 2 . The input capacitance of this model was similar to, but slightly larger than, that measured from dissociated RE cells <ref> (Huguenard and Prince, 1992) </ref>. A procedure was developed, based on a simplex algorithm (Press et al., 1986), for fitting the simulations to experimental data to find optimal values for passive parameters. <p> The kinetics of activation and inactivation of I T s in RE cells, as well as the activation curves of I T s , obtained from voltage-clamp recordings in acutely dissociated RE cells <ref> (Huguenard and Prince, 1992) </ref>, were: I T s = g Ca m 2 h (V E Ca ) 1 (m m 1 (V )) (1) 1 (h h 1 (V )) where g Ca (in mS=cm 2 ) is the maximum value of the conductance of the Ca 2+ current, E <p> The expressions for steady-state activation and inactivation functions obtained were <ref> (Huguenard and Prince, 1992) </ref>: m 1 (V ) = 1 = (1 + exp [(V + 52)=7:4]) and the voltage-dependent time constants were: t m (V ) = 1 + 0:33 = (exp [(V + 27)=10] + exp [(V + 102)=15]) as obtained from fitting the time constants measured from the <p> We used these values as the basis for the passive properties of the RE cell in the models presented here. Localization of the T-current The kinetic parameters used for modeling I T s were obtained from voltage-clamp experiments on acutely dissociated RE cells <ref> (Huguenard and Prince, 1992) </ref>. They were best described by a Hodgkin-Huxley formalism with two activation gates and one inactivation gate, for which the voltage-dependent parameters were obtained by fitting exponential expressions to the values determined experimentally (see below). <p> Simulated steady-state inactivation of I T s is shown in Fig. 6B. Fig. 6 here The values for the activation (t m ) and inactivation (t h ) time constants of I T s are shown in Fig. 6C-D <ref> (see also Fig. 6C-D of Huguenard and Prince, 1992) </ref>. The best fit of these values assumed a voltage-dependence described by bi-exponential expressions (see Methods) and are shown in Fig. 6C-D (see also Destexhe et al., 1994). <p> However, the space clamp was almost perfect in the dissociated cell model (not shown), suggesting that in this preparation the estimates of the kinetics of the T-current were reliable <ref> (see Huguenard and Prince, 1992) </ref>. Fourth, presumed dendritic impalements of RE cells in vivo show a burst structure dominated by a broad spike with smaller-amplitude spikes (Fig. 11). <p> Alternatively, the T-channels might somehow be altered by the dissociation procedure, in which case the difference in amplitude would be artifactual. The higher amplitude of T-current in dissociated TC cells compared to dissociated RE cells <ref> (Huguenard and Prince, 1992) </ref> argues against this possibility. This difference also implies that there is less T-current in the dendrites of TC cells compared to RE cells. 2. <p> The long duration and the slow rise of the burst in RE cells can be explained by the same mechanism, in addition to the slower kinetics of I T s <ref> (Huguenard and Prince, 1992) </ref>. 4. The voltage trace in the dendrites of the model during the burst were consistent with the presumed dendritic recordings in RE cells (Fig. 11). These recordings show a broad spike with low-amplitude sodium spikes, which is atypical for RE cells.

Reference-contexts: The immediate consequence is that more hyperpolarizing current is needed to reach the level of deinactivation of I T s in the dendrites. Since some RE neurons are larger than the cell studied here <ref> (see Jones, 1985) </ref>, that this effect would be even more prominent in adult animals. 3. The accelerando-decelerando pattern of fast spikes within the burst is consistent with dendritic I T s . We could not replicate this characteristic pattern in the absence of dendrites (Fig. 14).

Reference-contexts: We used these recordings to estimate the passive parameters by fitting the model to the data (Fig. 2A). It has been shown that when the cable geometry of the cell is known, this procedure should lead to a unique set of parameter values if they are uniform <ref> (Rall et al., 1992) </ref>, which Destexhe et al., Journal of Neuroscience 16: 169-185, 1996 5 was the case here. A direct fit to current-clamp recording was not performed here, since the model included only a subset of the currents present in these cells. <p> The capacitance was measured by dividing the integrated charge by the voltage step. This resulted in a specific capacitance of about 0.5 F=cm 2 , which is low compared with the typical value of 1 F=cm 2 <ref> (see Rall et al., 1992) </ref>. The strong non-isopotentiality of the cell (estimated L &gt; 2:5) together with a high series resistance could explain this discrepancy. <p> The axial resistivity between 200 and 300 cm is high compared to the values around 70 cm measured in mammalian neurons (Barrett and Crill, 1974). However, the latter is probably an underestimate <ref> (see Rall et al., 1992) </ref> and our result is consistent with the 100-300 cm range for axial resistivity obtained by matching detailed models to experimental data in other cell types (Cauller and Connors, 1992; Stratford et al., 1992; Major et al., 1994; Rapp et al., 1994).
