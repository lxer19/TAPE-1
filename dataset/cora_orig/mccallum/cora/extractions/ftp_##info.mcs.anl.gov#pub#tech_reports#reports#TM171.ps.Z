Reference-contexts: The process coupled model couples this process with an ocean model. A complete description of Fortran M is provided in a separate document <ref> [1] </ref>. 3.2 Compatability Libraries A compatability library allows a program written in a foreign parallel programming language such as Fortran+NX, Fortran+PICL, C+p4, PCN, or HPF to be invoked as a process in a Fortran M program.
