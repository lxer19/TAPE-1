Reference-contexts: The tables are obtained at the time of calibration and are loaded when the machine starts up. sentation at video rate opens up a new class of applica-tions for 3D vision, such as real-time z keying <ref> (Kanade et al., 1995) </ref>. In visual media communication and display, it is often necessary to merge a video signal from a real camera and a synthetic video signal from computer graphics. A standard technique for merging video signals is chroma keying, which is used, for example, in TV weather reports.

Reference-contexts: Also, one should notice that the valley of the SSAD curve is sharper than SADs, meaning that we can localize the minimum position more precisely, thereby producing greater precision in depth measurement. The algorithm has been successfully tested with indoor and outdoor scenes under a variety of conditions <ref> (Okutomi et al., 1992, Nakahara and Kanade, 1992) </ref>. 3.2 Geometric Rectification and Correction of Images The calculation of absolute difference AD k in equation (2) assumes inputs of rectified images.

Reference-contexts: There are several advanced real-time stereo systems <ref> (Nishihara, 1990, Webb, 1993, Matthies, 1992, Faugeras et al., 1993) </ref>; yet none of them is able to provide complete video-rate output of range as dense as the input image with low latency. We have developed a video-rate stereo machine which has the throughput of 30 million pixel 2 /sec.

Reference-contexts: An example scene and its range image are shown in Figure 2. The stereo machine outputs a pair of intensity and depth images at 30 frames/sec. 3. THEORY FOR THE STEREO MACHINE 3.1 Multi-Baseline Stereo theory The stereo machine employs multi-baseline stereo theory <ref> (Okutomi and Kanade, 1993) </ref>. Assuming that stereo images have been rectified, the disparity d is related to the distance z to the scene point by: (1) where B and F are baseline and focal length, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Then the squared difference AD k (s,t,z) has the following expression. (4) Here I k and J k are functions of rectified coordinates (s,t) and z, while I 0 and J 0 are functions of only (s,t) (Figure 4). Either strong calibration methods <ref> (Tsai, 1987, Kimura et al., 1995) </ref> or weak calibration methods (Faugeras, 1992) enable us to obtain these functions. 3.3 Summary of the Algorithm for Hardware Implementation The algorithm implemented on the stereo machine con sists of three steps as shown in Figure 5.
