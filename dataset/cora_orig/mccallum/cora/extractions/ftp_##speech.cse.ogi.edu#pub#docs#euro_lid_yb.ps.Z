Abstract: An approach to Language Identification (LID) based on language-dependent phone recognition is presented. This LID system is designed to exploit varying phonotactic constraints of different languages. Based on the output of language-dependent phone recognizers, various LID features are extracted. Two methods are proposed to enhance the language modeling accuracy, (1) language models based on forward and backward bigrams, and (2) backpropagation based language model optimization. The system was evaluated on a standard 11-language task and a standard nine-language task. The results(correct rate) reached 87.6% for 45-second long utterances and 73.6% for 10-second long utterances for the 11-language task, and reached 87.8% and 74.0% respectively on the nine-language task. By adding channel normalization, the performance of our best systems was further improved to 90.8% and 77.1% for the 11-language task, and 91.1% and 77.5% on the nine-language task.

Reference-contexts: Our baseline LID system is composed of three parts: (1) language-dependent phone recognizers, (2) LID score generators, and (3) a final language classifier. The baseline system architecture is similar to that in [5,6]. In <ref> [2] </ref> we introduced a forward and backward bigram based language model and evaluated our system on a six-language task. Recently, our system has been generalized for an 11-language task; a novel language model optimization method based on error backpropagation is introduced in this paper. <p> How to incorporate acoustic features into our current LID system is under consideration. Comparative experiments between approaches to information integration using linear classifiers and neural-networks supports our previous conclusion on a smaller task <ref> [2] </ref>, which showed the necessity of non-linear combination of all the LID scores from different information sources for better system performance. The performance of the forward and backward bigram based language model proposed shows that this model is a good compromise between detailed modeling and data limitations.

Reference-contexts: Four enhanced systems are also listed in Table 1. The systems listed as BS NN, BS BK, and BS OP each contain one improvement with respect to the BS system. BS NN contains a feed-forward neural-network with conjugate gradient optimization <ref> [3] </ref> being used as the final classifier, in BS BK both the forward and backward bigram based language models are used, and BS OP includes optimization of the language models.
