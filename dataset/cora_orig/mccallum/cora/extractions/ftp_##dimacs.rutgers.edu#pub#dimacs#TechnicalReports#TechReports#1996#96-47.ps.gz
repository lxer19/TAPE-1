Reference-contexts: Let i (n; ffi) denote the maximum of the independent domination numbers over the graphs with n vertices and the minimum degree at least ffi. By a theorem of B. Bollobas and E. J. Cockayne in <ref> [1] </ref>, i (n; 1) n + 2 2 n.

Reference-contexts: Let i (n; ffi) denote the maximum of the independent domination numbers over the graphs with n vertices and the minimum degree at least ffi. By a theorem of B. Bollobas and E. J. Cockayne in [1], i (n; 1) n + 2 2 n. Favaron <ref> [2] </ref> proved the bound i (n; ffi) n + 3ffi 2 q conjectured that i (n; ffi) n + 2ffi 2 ffin: (1) This last bound (if true), for every fixed positive integer ffi, is attained on in finitely many graphs.

Reference-contexts: Favaron [2] proved the bound i (n; ffi) n + 3ffi 2 q conjectured that i (n; ffi) n + 2ffi 2 ffin: (1) This last bound (if true), for every fixed positive integer ffi, is attained on in finitely many graphs. Haviland <ref> [3] </ref> improved the bound of Favaron as follows: if 0 ffi (n 2)=7, then i (n; ffi) n + 3ffi minf1 + 2 q q and if (n 2)=7 ffi n=4, then i (n; ffi) 2 (n ffi)=3.
