Abstract: We describe the design of an User Interface for a ranked output Information Retrieval system that integrates querying, navigation and visualization in a seamless fashion. Highlights of the system include the following:

In all these cases, the user need not necessarily have a specific information need in mind and may not be able to formulate a query. Conversely, the user might want to browse through the documents as mentioned above while perusing the results of a previously constructed query.

Reference-contexts: Fidel [Fid91a, Fid91b, Fid91c] discusses the issue of user interaction by studying the process of search term selection and searching styles in online library access catalogs. Dal-rymple [Dal90] looks at the feedback process from a user-centered perspective. Bates <ref> [Bat90] </ref> describes a boolean retrieval system which integrates an online thesaurus. None of the above studies involve a ranked output system supporting free-form textual queries. All of the above systems deal with boolean systems only.

Reference-contexts: Along these lines, we believe that the system should support a rich set of browsing features to enable users with diverse information needs and searching strategies and to help the user through different stages of knowledge acquisition as highlighted by Belkin's notion of ASK <ref> [BOB82] </ref>. To this end, the interface facilitates browsing articles by authors and browsing the table of contents of journal issues and conference proceedings. <p> the query words play a dominant part in retrieving the results and the user has a better idea of what type of query modification is necessary during the next iteration. 4 Browsing The motivation to integrate browsing features in a querying system has been strongly influenced by [Bat89], [Hil89] and <ref> [BOB82] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Our interface is a step in that direction by integrating different pieces of information with a visualization scheme and simple interaction techniques. 6 Conclusion & Future work A prototype interface written in Tcl/Tk [Ous94] using a ranked output information retrieval system, INQUERY <ref> [CCH92] </ref> for a library catalog, Compendex containing about 300,000 documents has been implemented.

Reference-contexts: The interface we have developed integrates relevance feedback information from the user as well as feedback from the system illustrating the relationship between query results and query words. 10 11 12 A number of visualization schemes for information retrieval systems have also been proposed. The perspective wall <ref> [CRM91] </ref> describes a visualization scheme which supports browsing of documents. While such a system can not handle qualitative document classifications such as library subject catalogs, it is very useful for visualizing documents based on data which is linear in nature (like date of publication).

Reference-contexts: This could be done, for example, by pointing and 'picking' them on the screen and carrying them across another area of the screen. The user would not have to input them again." This is precisely what has been accomplished in our interface. In their retrieval system, Campbell <ref> [CS] </ref> uses a cut-and-paste mechanism for relevance feedback by letting the user add portions of retrieved documents back into the query window. This section dealt with the interaction technique to let the user provide relevance feedback information to the system.

Reference-contexts: Also, most of them do not support querying with relevance feedback and none of them support query expansion using a thesaurus. The visualization scheme in our interface can gracefully handle much higher number of query word dimensions. The TileBars work by Marti Heart <ref> [Hea95] </ref> visually shows the query term ditri-bution and overlap in retrieved documents. The term distribution in retrieved documents is shown right besides the title of the document. In a number of respects, the reasons and motivations for her work are similar to those of our visualization work [VNH95, VN95].

The interface also supports a visualization scheme which illustrates how the query results are related to the query words.
