Title: Probabilistic Coreference in Information Extraction  
Author: Andrew Kehler 
Keyword: FASTUS information extraction system.  
Address: 333 Ravenswood Avenue Menlo Park, CA 94025  
Affiliation: SRI International  
Abstract: Certain applications require that the output of an information extraction system be probabilistic, so that a downstream system can reliably fuse the output with possibly contradictory information from other sources. In this paper we consider the problem of assigning a probability distribution to alternative sets of coreference relationships among entity descriptions. We present the results of initial experiments with several approaches to estimating such distributions in an application using SRI's

Reference-contexts: Instead of viewing these distributions as constraints on the underlying probabilistic model, we view them as sources of evidence. The question is then how to take these sources into account, given that they may be partially contradictory. Dempster's Rule of Combination <ref> (Dempster, 1968) </ref> provides a mechanism for doing this.

Reference-contexts: To accomplish this, the fusion system must know the reliability of the information received from each source; in this way unreliable information from one source can be disregarded in favor of highly reliable information from another. system such as SRI's FASTUS system <ref> (Hobbs et al., 1996) </ref>. The IE system has two components. The first component consists of a series of phases that recognize domain-relevant patterns in the text and create templates representing event and entity descriptions from them.
