Abstract: A typical B-rep describes a solid in its full detail. Collision detection algorithms that locally analyze the B-rep of non-convex objects usually process the entire B-rep due to the lack of spatial ordering of its topological entities. For very complex objects, this global processing is time consuming. It is also unnecessary. One approach in avoiding the global processing is to use several B-reps of different levels of detail. However, this does not always help. For instance, when objects in close proximity need to be analyzed for contact, the need for a local increase in resolution forces a global increase in detail. Our solution is to unify the different levels of detail and provide the means to locally control them. We introduce a locally resolvable B-rep (LRB-rep) as a non-manifold B-rep data structure with locally varying levels-of-detail for representing complex objects. The LRB-rep locally hides the solid's details with several layers of faces. A subset of all the faces provides a global approximation of this solid. We call this the wrapper. The wrapper starts with the faces of the LRB-rep's outer-most layer and, controlled by some application, may change its shape. Local face refinements reveals more detail and eventually resolve the wrapper to the original object with the highest level of detail. A two-body collision detection algorithm can use the LRB-reps as follows. Instead of checking the complex boundaries of both solids, the wrapper of one solid can be checked against the wrapper of the other solid. The wrapper faces that interpenetrate can be refined and recursively checked. Faces that do not interpenetrate can be ignored in further checking and not refined. The motivations behind the LRB-rep design are 1) to check as few face pairs as possible when detecting collisions between two complex objects in close proximity; 2) to avoid fragmentation caused by the use of some hierarchical approaches such as the BSP and the MSP trees during classification and 3) to overcome various other limitations of hierarchical approaches, such as the octrees or the MSP trees. In this paper we introduce the LRB-rep, the wrapper and its operations, prove several properties, provide empirical results based on our implementation, and suggest its use for the n-body problem.

Reference-contexts: Modifying the BSP trees to yield a set-theoretic intersection which is necessary to analyze the contact <ref> [BV94] </ref>, would destroy its efficiency. Our method is based on face abstraction and cellular decomposition of space. Several adjacent faces can be abstracted to a smaller set of new faces which, together with the original set, enclose a region of space outside and adjacent to the object.

Reference-contexts: It follows, however, that with Equations (7) and the equivalent incremental form of i;i1 , Equation (4) yields the incremental wrapper. 6 Implementation and Empirical Results We have implemented the LRB-rep data structure in C++ as part of the Proxima/Isaac projects <ref> [CG94] </ref>. The LRB-rep extensions were added to a non-manifold B-rep data structure with a topological structure consisting of vertex, edge, directed-edge, face, and brep nodes. The data structure uses bridge-edges for multi-connected faces and it does not represent shells explicitly. <p> Then after each pass, say a collision test, the fragmented LRB-reps have to be returned to their canonical form. It is easy to verify that this modification unpholds the cover property. 8 Discussion This representation is motivated by our work in collision detection and virtual environments <ref> [CG94] </ref>. In virtual environments, objects bump, slide, and maintain prolonged contact as the norm, not the 14 exception. In general, most objects are in close proximity to other objects.

Reference-contexts: This convexification results in an O (n 2 ) complexity when n convex pieces result. For complex objects, n, can be prohibitively large. Recently, Cohen, Manocha, Lin, and Ponamgi addressed this problem by adding a hierarchy of convex bounding volumes <ref> [CML + 94] </ref>. Empirical results show that the quadratic cost is greatly reduced yielding reasonable performance.

Reference-contexts: Localizing the search to only the faces in the local vicinity of the contact is possible if the levels of detail are merged in a way that allows incremental testing of only some faces at each level. One approach was suggested by de Floriani with the Face-adjacency Multigraph <ref> [dF88] </ref> which is a hierarchical representation using B-reps. Protrusions and depressions are treated as separate solids that are related to the parent solid by their contact faces. One face on the parent is related to one face of the protrusion or the depression [dFF88, Ad88].

Reference-contexts: However, this class does not include all polyhedral objects, and it is not clear whether the method would benefit extremely complex objects. Representing an object at different levels of detail is also a common technique used in visualization systems (for example, walk throughs [FS93] and virtual reality <ref> [FP94] </ref>). The object is reconstructed at lower levels of detail based on the distance to the observer. This is based on the observation that much of the detail becomes invisible at a certain distance and therefore need not be rendered explicitly. <p> Usually, when complex objects are considered, auxiliary structures such as an octree [Sam89b, Sam89a], a BSP tree [Nay90], an MSP tree [Van91], 3 a sphere tree [Hub94], some hierarchical grid structure <ref> [FP94] </ref>, or some hierarchical bounding--volume structure possibly combined with varying levels-of-detail [AP94] are added to find which entities on the boundary are closest.

Reference-contexts: The process of abstracting faces is similar to filling in the depressions and cavities with material until a smooth simple object results. This idea has been studied in the area of feature recognition originally by Mark Henderson <ref> [Hen84] </ref>. We propose a new boundary-based representation called the Locally Resolvable B-rep (LRB-rep). This is a typical polyhedral and non-manifold B-rep which contains new faces, edges, and vertices added in the face-abstraction process in addition to the original entities.

Reference-contexts: There has been a lot of work done in the area of collision detection. Much of it has focused on the pair-wise collision test of convex objects. Most system that deal with multiple non-convex bodies suffer what Hubbard calls the pair-processing weakness <ref> [Hub93] </ref> in that once objects get very close many of the approaches have to test polygons against polygons to detect the contact or interpenetration.

Reference-contexts: In general, most objects are in close proximity to other objects. When the objects are complex, contact analysis and collision detection must take time proportional to the local complexity of the contact and not the global complexity of the objects. For convex objects, Lin and Canny's algorithm <ref> [LC91] </ref> provides a constant-time incremental algorithm that tracks their minimum distance. This algorithm, however, does not generalize well to non-convex and complex objects undergoing contact analysis. The algorithm does not provide contact region information once contact has been detected, and non-convex objects need to be convexified.

Reference-contexts: We first show that the wrapper of Definition 2 contains a set of faces that are consistently oriented <ref> [Man84] </ref>. Given a valid LRB-rep, we know that for a given face its support plane has a normal whose direction dictates a counter-clockwise orientation of the edges (also vertices) around 8 the face.

Although these work well for lower complexity objects, most fail with complex objects. <p> The open problem is avoiding this global search and still providing a fully incremental algorithm.

Reference-contexts: An approach that addresses this problem has been addressed for the Binary Space Partition trees by Naylor <ref> [Nay93] </ref>. Naylor shows that BSP trees for complex objects can be constructed which exhibit locally resolution of detail. The local resolution of detail is inherent in the tree structure; higher detail occurs lower in the tree. Controlling the depth thus controls the detail.

Reference-contexts: However, this partitioning should not break space into convex regions that are unrelated to the local geometry of the object or that do not maintain the proximity relationship. The idea of representing a polyhedral object at different levels of detail is not new. Pentland and Sclaroff <ref> [PS91] </ref> use deformable superquadric ellipsoids. Their surfaces are modulated by displacement maps with which collisions are easier to detect. This method is appropriate for the class of objects that can be represented by superquadrics.

Reference-contexts: Suppose at first, that all regions are dense everywhere and, therefore, none are cover regions. Then the union of any subset is, by definition, regular <ref> [Req80] </ref>. Since W (C i ) is the boundary of that subset, the volume must be regular. Now consider the presence of cover regions. Clearly, an arbitrary subset of all the regions (i.e., fR (c) j c 2 C (B)g assuming closed regions) need not be regular.
