Abstract: Distributed Artificial Intelligence systems, in which multiple agents interact to improve their individual performance and to enhance the systems overall utility, are becoming an increasingly pervasive means of conceptualising a diverse range of applications. As the discipline matures, researchers are beginning to strive for the underlying theories and principles which guide the central processes of coordination and cooperation. Here agent communities are modelled using a distributed goal search formalism and it is argued that commitments (pledges to undertake a specified course of action) and conventions (means of monitoring commitments in changing circumstances) are the foundation of coordination in multi-agent systems. An analysis of existing coordination models which use concepts akin to commitments and conventions is undertaken before a new unifying framework is presented. Finally a number of prominent coordination techniques which do not explicitly involve commitments or conventions are reformulated in these terms to demonstrate their compliance with the central hypothesis of this paper.

Reference-contexts: This review concentrates on agents which possess a range of identifiable problem solving capabilities, have their own aims and objectives, are relatively autonomous in deciding what actions to perform and can reason about the process of coordination. These characteristics debar some well known networks of cooperating entities including ACTORS <ref> (Agha, 1986) </ref>, BEINGS (Lenat, 1975) and neural networks (McClelland and Rumelhart, 1986). In all of these systems, cooperative behaviour stems from predefined interactions between tightly coupled, simple processing elements. Each individual has little knowledge of the systems overall objective or of general strategies for communication and coordination.

Reference-contexts: Like many other folk psychology concepts, the term intention has been given various interpretations, although most of them have the concept of commitment at their core. The notion of commitment is given such prominence because it is central to three aspects of an agents practical reasoning process <ref> (Bratman, 1984) </ref>. Firstly as agents are resource bounded, they cannot continually weigh their competing desires and their associated beliefs in deciding what to do next. At some point, the agent must just settle on one state of affairs for which to aim, thus creating a commitment to obtain that objective. <p> Other types of temporal relationship, such as BEFORE, DURING and OVERLAPS (Allen, 1984), can also be modelled in this manner. 10. Commitments provide a filter of admissability <ref> (Bratman, 1984) </ref>, agents should not commit themselves to something which will conict with or endanger their existing commitments without good cause. 11. A joint commitment involving one agent is equivalent to an individual commitment. 18 Agent 2 through its processing of G 2 m,2 .

Reference-contexts: For this reason, an agents commitments should, as far as it is aware, be both internally consistent and consistent with its beliefs <ref> (Bratman, 1990) </ref>. The former means that an individuals commitments should not conict with one another - for example an agent should not pledge to simultaneously perform two goals which both require the same non-shareable resource.

Reference-contexts: Analysis of this combinatorial implosion phenomena (Hewitt and Kornfield, 1980) has resulted in the postulation that cooperative search, when sufficiently large, can display universal characteristics which are independent of the nature of either the individual processes or the particular domain being tackled <ref> (Clearwater et al., 1991) </ref>.
