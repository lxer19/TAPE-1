Title: Commonsense Knowledge of Space: Learning from Experience

Abstract: The TOUR model is a computational model of human commonsense knowledge of large-scale space. It shows how observations are assimilated into a description, from multiple perspectives, of the spatial environment. In this paper we propose a representation for sensory events at a level suited to this investigation, and an inference strategy by which these sensory events are assimilated into descriptions of spatial structure. We also discuss the states of partial knowledge that occur during the learning process, and show that the representation exhibits graceful degradation of performance under resource limitations.

Reference-contexts: Knowledge of large-scale space (e.g. the "cognitive map" of a city (Lynch, 1960) is particularly accessible to study because the process of assimilating new information is constrained by the speed of physical travel, so states of partial knowledge are easily observable. The TOUR model <ref> (Kuipers, 1977,1978) </ref> is a computational model of the cognitive map, exhibiting a solution to the problem: How can local observations acquired during travel be assimilated into a structure that permits an swering route finding and relative position ques tions? The model consists of a number of different representations for spatial relationships, <p> Descriptions link representations of spa tial features at different levels of detail. The observational input to the TOUR model is simulated as a sequence of partially specified travel instructions containing only information that could be acquired from a local observation. All other information is supplied by the assimilation process <ref> (Kuipers, 1977, 1978) </ref>. While this permits subsequent acquisition of order and local geometry information (and thence the rest of the cognitive map), there remain easily observable phenomena for which no explanation can be stated in terms of this representation. 1.

Reference-contexts: I just know what to do." Interface With The TOUR Model A complete set of fully specified triples can be used to create the partially specified route instructions previously assumed as input to the TOUR model <ref> (Kuipers, 1978) </ref>. Thus, the previously described assimilation processes can operate with the new form of observations. The two procedural route descriptions are nonetheless necessary, since the Triples are stated in terms of sensory events, while the instructions are stated in terms of internal descriptions of places and paths.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Commonsense knowledge of space is a particularly interesting domain of human knowledge, because common-sense knowledge is a powerful and mysterious aspect of human thought, and because spatial knowledge is widely applied and distinctly different from linguistic knowledge. Knowledge of large-scale space (e.g. the "cognitive map" of a city <ref> (Lynch, 1960) </ref> is particularly accessible to study because the process of assimilating new information is constrained by the speed of physical travel, so states of partial knowledge are easily observable.
