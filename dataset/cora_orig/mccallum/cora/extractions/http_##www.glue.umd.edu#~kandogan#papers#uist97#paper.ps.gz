Abstract: The World-Wide Web is becoming an invaluable source for the information needs of many users. However, current browsers are still primitive, in that they do not support many of the navigation needs of users, as indicated by user studies. They do not provide an overview and a sense of location in the information structure being browsed. Also they do not facilitate organization and filtering of information nor aid users in accessing already visited pages without high cognitive demands. In this paper, a new browsing interface is proposed with multiple hierarchical windows and efficient multiple window operations. It provides a flexible environment where users can quickly organize, filter, and restructure the information on the screen as they reformulate their goals. Overviews can give the user a sense of location in the browsing history as well as provide fast access to a hierarchy of pages.

We believe that approaches should be evaluated thoroughly by user studies based on observations examining users' browsing tasks and navigational strategies. Among the web browsers, only a few are evaluated by user experiments <ref> [3] </ref>. We have conducted a user study comparing the Elastic Windows approach to the independent overlapping windows approach. Results indicated faster user performance for the Elastic Windows interface among expert users in the context of personal role management tasks [15].

Reference-contexts: Then, our browsing interface is presented with its design principles and examined based on its compliance with the results of these user studies. Technical information regarding the implementation of the Elastic Windows browser is also discussed with reference to a more detailed description. PROBLEM MOTIVATION Conklin <ref> [9] </ref> identified the problems with hypertext as: * Disorientation: The tendency to lose one's sense of loca tion and direction in a nonlinear document. * Cognitive overhead: The additional effort and concentra tion necessary to maintain several tasks or trails at once.

Reference-contexts: It is about how users seek a balance between the gains of added knowledge and the losses from increased distraction by following a link. Marchionini and Shneiderman [16] argue that in browsing, goals are not well defined and change dynamically as new information is encountered by the user. Cruz <ref> [10] </ref> observed that current web browsers give little flexibility to users both in filtering out unwanted information and in the specification of the spatial and temporal layout. This limits user's browsing and organization capabilities. The fundamental mechanism for organization is composition.

Reference-contexts: * Frequent visits only to very few pages: Personal and orga nization pages, search engines, etc. * Browse in small clusters of pages * Short sequences of repeated URL paths ELASTIC WINDOWS WEB BROWSER Hierarchical Page Organization The Elastic Windows browser is a multi-window browser, where pages are organized hierarchically <ref> [14, 15] </ref>. Hierarchical organization of pages allows the user to see the context, while exploring further details lower in the hierarchy. Although syntactic information structure on the WWW is an arbitrary graph, presenting the information in a hierarchy can help users in their information seeking activities. <p> Changes in the upper levels of the tree are propagated down the subtree to lower level nodes recursively, also avoiding unnecessary node traversals. More details on the window operations and layout dynamics are described in <ref> [14] </ref>. Scaling of page contents is done based on the window widths. Windows wider than a threshold value are reformatted keeping the same scaling factor. Galaxy libraries used in the implementation yielded sufficiently rapid graphics performance.
