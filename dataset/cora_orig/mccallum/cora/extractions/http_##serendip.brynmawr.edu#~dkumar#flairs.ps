Abstract: We describe an integrated belief-desire-intention (BDI) architecture that is capable of acting in service of inference and vice versa. The results are achieved by identifying the relationship between inference and acting, and making certain architectural and ontological commitments. A single module called a rational engine operates on a uniform representation of beliefs, acts, plans, and reasoning rules. The architecture is implemented in the SNePS semantic network processing system.

Reference-contexts: It is also the module responsible for the agent's acting and planning behavior. It employs an assumption-based truth maintenance (ATMS) system [7]. Thus, inferences, once drawn, are retained by the agent as long as their underlying support persists. The ATMS is also employed for implementing the extended STRIPS assumption <ref> [1] </ref> for acting [6].

A transformer is a propositional representation that subsumes various notions of inference and acting. <p> Thus, acting was performed in service of inference. We have also abstracted the main features of our architecture into a general object-oriented BDI architecture (called the OK BDI architecture) which we are in the process of developing <ref> [2] </ref>. The object-orientedness of the OK architecture is amenable to a concurrent implementation (our present architecture is also implemented using a quasi-concurrent computational paradigm).

Reference-contexts: During backward chaining, the mental acting executive forms the intention of believing the consequents of a rule if its antecedents are satisfied (i.e., preconditions are fulfilled). Similarly for forward chaining. McCarthy has also suggested that inference can be treated as a mental action <ref> [8] </ref>. Alternatively, plans can be viewed as rules for acting. Reasoning rules pass a truth or a belief status from antecedent to consequent, whereas acting rules pass an intention status from earlier acts to later acts.

Reference-contexts: Other quantifiers include the existential, and the numerical quantifiers (see <ref> [9] </ref>). Belief-Act Transformers: These are transformers where hffi is a set of belief (s) and hfii is a set of acts. Used during backward chaining, these can be propositions specifying preconditions of actions, i.e. hffi is a precondition of some act hfii.

Reference-contexts: We impose an additional requirement that the modeled agent be capable of interaction using natural language. The modeled agent's beliefs, plans, acts, and rules are represented in the SNePS semantic network formalism <ref> [10] </ref>. SNePS is an intentional, propositional semantic network system. Nodes in the semantic network represent conceptual entities|individuals, and structured individuals. Structured individuals can be propositions, which are used to represent beliefs, or acts and plans.
