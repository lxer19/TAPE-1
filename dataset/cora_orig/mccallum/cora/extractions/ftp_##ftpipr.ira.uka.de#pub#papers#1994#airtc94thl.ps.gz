Abstract: In a distributed robot system, asynchronous and synchronous communication between the system components is necessary to guarantee problem soliving capability in real-time. On that account, the distributed control architecure of the Karlsruhe Autonomous Mobile Robot KAMRO which is being developed at IPR has been extended by these communication kinds. The robot system consists of several subcomponents, like manipulators, two hand-eye-cameras, one overhead camera and a mobile platform. To get better problem solving capability than the former centralized control architecture, these components are able to work together in teams (asynchronous communication) or special agents (synchronous communication).

Reference-contexts: Decentralized Systems: Each executive component makes its own decisions and executes only these decisions (see Fig.2c). Controller Task Subtasks a) Channel Task Communication b) Task Task Task c) F i g . 2 : Execution view of multi-agent systems Centralized control architectures are often divided into functional-based <ref> (Albus, 1991) </ref> and behaviour-based (Brooks, 1986) systems. In both architectures, the number and complexity of the hierarchical system levels are responsible for reaction time and for task execution itself. The development of these architectures is very difficult because it's not easy to determine the suitability of this concept in advance.

Reference-contexts: In contrast to that, distributed or decentralized control architectures show their main advantages, when it's necessary to enhance the system, to integrate components, and to maintain the system. This new concept consists of local intelligence, local world representation, decentralized communication, dynamic teams and uses concepts of distributed artificial intelligence <ref> (Bond and Gasser, 1988) </ref>.
