Title: ALIASING IN THE AF-GDTFD AND THE DISCRETE SPECTROGRAM

Abstract: It has recently been claimed that many of the discrete time-frequency representations (TFRs), including the alias free generalize time-frequency distributions (AF-GDTFD), contain aliasing components. This paper shows that the class of AF-GDTFD does indeed displace both cross term and auto term energy in ways not characteristic of continuous TFRs, but this energy displacement does not satisfy our traditional definition of aliasing. Since the discrete time spectrogram is a member of the class of AF-GDTFD, it will displace energy in ways not characteristic of the continuous spectrogram. This paper creates a procedure by which this energy displacement can be properly understood. Since a discrete time TFR should be periodic in frequency, it is suggested that the displaced energy be interpreted as cross terms across the periodic boundary and not as aliasing.

Reference-contexts: Perfect interpolation is assumed for ease of analysis.) The analysis of the AF-GDTFD in the time-frequency plane proves to be very enlightening. Taking Fourier transforms in the lag direction of the modified TACF results in a discrete time Wigner distribution without any aliasing <ref> [1] </ref>. Similarly taking Fourier transforms in the lag direction of the modified kernel gives us a representation of the modified kernel in the time-frequency plane. The AF-GDTFD is then computed by performing a two-dimensional convolution of the discrete time, alias free Wigner distribution with the modified kernel.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION The Wigner distribution and other members of Cohen's class of distributions have proven to be very useful in many signal processing applications <ref> [2] </ref>. To actually implement these distributions on a computer one needs to discretize the time and frequency variables.

Reference-contexts: The most direct approach results in aliasing in the frequency direction and as a result there have been many different definitions of discrete time-frequency distributions in an attempt to overcome this problem (see <ref> [3] </ref> and references therein). Costa and Boudreaux-Bartels [3] have claimed that many of the discrete time-frequency representations, including the AF-GDTFD by Jeong and Williams [5], do contain aliasing. In particular they claimed that the AF-GDTFD can alias cross term components. <p> The most direct approach results in aliasing in the frequency direction and as a result there have been many different definitions of discrete time-frequency distributions in an attempt to overcome this problem (see <ref> [3] </ref> and references therein).

Reference-contexts: Since a discrete time TFR should be periodic in frequency, it is suggested that the displaced energy be interpreted as cross terms across the periodic repetition. It has been shown that the continuous spectrogram is a member of Cohen's class of distributions. Cunningham and Williams <ref> [4] </ref> have also shown that the discrete time spectrogram is a member of the class of AF-GDTFD. So the discrete spectrogram not only contains cross terms, but also displaces both cross term and auto term energy in ways not characteristic of the continuous spectrogram. 2. <p> The one-dimensional convolution, in time, of the hexagonally sampled TACF with a hexagonally sampled kernel results in a generalized TACF that is sampled on a rectangular grid. One then takes Fourier transforms in the lag direction to obtain a time-frequency distribution. It has been shown by Cunningham and Williams <ref> [4] </ref> that the kernel corresponding to a discrete spectrogram is the outer product of the window function with itself. 3. ENERGY DISPLACEMENT IN THE AF-GDTFD The analysis of the AF-GDTFD in the time-frequency plane is somewhat difficult due to the hexagonally sampled TACF and kernel.

Reference-contexts: The AF-GDTFD is then computed by performing a two-dimensional convolution of the discrete time, alias free Wigner distribution with the modified kernel. Three examples of modified kernels in the time-frequency plane for the AF-GDTFD are shown in constructed specifically for the class of AF-GDTFD, and has many interesting properties <ref> [6] </ref>. The second kernel is called a quasi-Wigner kernel and is "close" to the continuous time Wigner kernel (there is no true Wigner distribution in the class of AF-GDTFD). The third kernel corresponds to a discrete spectrogram using a Hanning window. Each kernel contains two distinct parts.
