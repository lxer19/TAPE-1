Abstract: In the absence of vision, grasping an object often relies on tactile feedback from the fingertips. As the finger pushes the object, the fingertip can feel the contact point move. If the object is known in advance, from this motion the finger may infer the location of the contact point on the object and thereby the object pose. This paper primarily investigates the problem of determining the pose (orientation and position) and motion (velocity and angular velocity) of a planar object with known geometry from such contact motion generated by pushing. A dynamic analysis of pushing yields a nonlinear system that relates through contact the object pose and motion to the finger motion. The contact motion on the fingertip thus encodes certain information about the object pose. Nonlinear observability theory is employed to show that such information is sufficient for the finger to "observe" not only the pose but also the motion of the object. Therefore a sensing strategy can be realized as an observer of the nonlinear dynamical system. Two observers are subsequently introduced. The first observer, based on the result of [15], has its "gain" determined by the solution of a Lyapunov-like equation; it can be activated at any time instant during a push. The second observer, based on Newton's method, solves for the initial (motionless) object pose from three intermediate contact points during a push.

Reference-contexts: Their work assumes known contact edge and does not quantitively estimate the object's motion due to the quasi-static nature. Also applying quasi-static analysis, Akella and Mason <ref> [1] </ref> described a complete open-loop planner that can orient and translate polygonal objects in the plane by pushing with a straight fence. <p> frictionless contact took 1012s. 18 The range of u in terms of the polar angle with respect to the disk center was set to be the interval [80; 100] (degrees); the range of s was determined from the contact edge; the ranges of ! and v T were set as <ref> [1; 1] </ref> (rad=s) and [0:4; 0:4] (cm=s 2 ), which were based on the velocity range of the Adept robot and on our simulation data of pushing. 19 The length of the period can be arbitrarily set but should be large enough.

Reference-contexts: Luenberger-like asymptotic observers, first constructed by Luenberger [34] for linear systems, remain likely the most commonly used observer forms for nonlinear systems today. Gauthier, Hammouri, and Othman <ref> [15] </ref> described an observer for affine-control nonlinear systems whose "gain" is determined via the solution of an appropriate Lyapunov-like equation.

Reference-contexts: Gaston and Lozano-Perez [14] showed how to identify and locate a polyhedron on a known plane using tactile information that includes contact points and the ranges of surface normals at these points. Grimson <ref> [20] </ref> advocated that model-based recognition and localization should be regarded as a constraint satisfaction problem that searches for a consistent matching between sensory data (e.g., 2D) and model (s) (e.g., 3D) under some geometric constraints.

Reference-contexts: Model-based recognition and localization traditionally solve a constraint satisfaction problem by searching for a consistent matching between sensory data and model (s). This is often conducted by pruning the search tree subject to pure geometric constraints.

Reference-contexts: A larger part of the motivation of our work was from parts orienting. Orienting mechanical parts was studied early on by Grossman and Blasgen <ref> [22] </ref>.

In our work, contact kinematics is derived directly from the absolute velocities of the finger and the object rather than from their relative velocity at the contact.

Reference-contexts: A result due to Crouch [9] shows that an analytic system is observable if and only if the observation space distinguishes points in the state space. Luenberger-like asymptotic observers, first constructed by Luenberger <ref> [34] </ref> for linear systems, remain likely the most commonly used observer forms for nonlinear systems today. Gauthier, Hammouri, and Othman [15] described an observer for affine-control nonlinear systems whose "gain" is determined via the solution of an appropriate Lyapunov-like equation. <p> An observer of a nonlinear system is a system whose state converges to the state of the original system. The input of the observer consists of the input as well as the output of the original system. Luenberger-like asymptotic observers <ref> [34] </ref> for nonlinear systems are often designed through linearization.

Reference-contexts: He constructed an algorithm with sub-cubic running time as a proof of sensorless parts orienting. Based on the limit surface model and quasi-static analysis, Lynch et al. <ref> [35] </ref> conducted active sensing of an object's center of mass during pushing from tactile feedback; and developed a control system that translates and orients objects. Their work assumes known contact edge and does not quantitively estimate the object's motion due to the quasi-static nature.

Reference-contexts: It also draws upon the part of nonlinear control theory that concerns nonlinear observability and observers. 1.1.1 Robotics Dynamics of sliding rigid bodies was treated by MacMillan <ref> [36] </ref> for non-uniform pressure distributions, and by Goyal et al. [19] using geometric methods based on the limit surface description of friction. Howe and Cutkosky [26] experimentally showed that the limit surface only approximates the force-motion relationship for sliding bodies and discussed other simplified practical models for sliding manipulation.

Reference-contexts: Howe and Cutkosky [26] experimentally showed that the limit surface only approximates the force-motion relationship for sliding bodies and discussed other simplified practical models for sliding manipulation. Mason <ref> [37] </ref> pioneered the study of the mechanics of pushing using quasi-static analysis, predicting the direction in which an object being pushed rotates and plotting out its instantaneous rotation center.

Reference-contexts: The problem of predicting the accelerations of multiple 3D objects in contact with Coulomb friction has a nonlinear complementarity formulation due to Pang and Trinkle [40]; the existence of solutions to models with sliding and rolling contacts has been established. Montana <ref> [38] </ref> derived a set of differential equations describing the motion of a contact point between two rigid bodies in response to a relative motion of these bodies, and employed these equations to sense the local curvature of an unknown object and to follow its surface while steering the contact point to <p> When the motion of B is pure translation (! = 0), the evaluation is easy: = (fi 0 fi)A ^ v: (16) 4 The term ff + fi is the 2-dimensional case of the relative curvature form introduced by Montana <ref> [38] </ref>. 5 Here fi is the curvature of the polygon edge in contact with ff.

Reference-contexts: For a general introduction to nonlinear control theory, we refer the reader to Isidori [27] and Nijmeijer and van der Schaft <ref> [39] </ref>. Hermann and Kerner [24] first studied observability using the notion of observation space. We will use their observability rank condition to show that the pose and motion of a polygonal object pushed by a disk is locally observable from the disk contact. <p> The equation dim dO (x 0 ) = n is called the observability rank condition. Proofs of the above theorem can be found in [24] and <ref> [39, pp. 95-96] </ref>. Basically, to distinguish between a state and any other state in its neighborhood, it is necessary to consider not only the output functions but also their derivatives along all possible system trajectories. <p> The disk-polygon system (26), however, cannot be linearized for we have L g N L f L g N L f u = r (r + h) (s 2 + 2 ) 3 ; violating one of Nijmeijer's necessary conditions <ref> [39, p. 156] </ref> on linearization. Another approach of observer design transforms the original system into a linear system modulo an output injection [32]. The necessary conditions for a nonlinear system to admit linear observer error dynamics are rather restrictive and hardly satisfied by the disk-polygon system, let alone system (7)-(10).

K. Peters, </editor> <booktitle> 1997. Proceedings of the 1996 Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics. </booktitle>
Reference-contexts: In our previous work [29], we introduced the methods of cone inscription and point sampling that compute the poses of known shapes from a continuum and a finite number of possibilities, respectively, using simple geometric constraints such as coincidence and containment. Paulos and Canny <ref> [41] </ref> studied the problem of finding optimal point probes for refining the pose of a polygonal part with known geometry from an approximate pose; they revealed that this problem is dual to the grasping problem of computing optimal finger placements and gave an efficient near-optimal solution.

Reference-contexts: This work requires an initial image of the object taken by a camera. Work related to caging includes parts feeder design <ref> [42] </ref> and fixture design [5]. In this paper, we are concerned with how to "feel" a known object using only one finger and how to infer its pose and motion information rather than how to constrain and grasp the object using multiple fingers.

Reference-contexts: Also we are concerned with a finger and object only in the plane not in 3D. Part of our motivation came from the blind grasping task at the beginning of the paper. The caging work by Rimon and Blake <ref> [43] </ref> is concerned with constructing the space of all configurations of a two-fingered hand controlled by one parameter that confine a given 2D object; these configurations can lead to immobilizing grasps by following continuous paths in the same space.

Reference-contexts: Subsequently, the tools which we will apply are from nonlinear control theory rather than from AI and computational geometry. One feasible implementation for contact detection is to employ a force or tactile sensor. The paper by Salisbury <ref> [44] </ref> proposed the concept of fingertip force sensing with an 5 approach for determining contact locations and orientations from force and moment mea-surements. Fearing and Binford [13] designed a cylindrical tactile sensor to determine the principal curvatures of an object through rolling contact.

Zimmer <ref> [46] </ref> presented a state estimator that conducts on-line minimization over some objective function. His observer, with provable convergence, iteratively uses Newton's method to modify its state estimate every fixed period of time.
