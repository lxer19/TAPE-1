Reference-contexts: In the latter case, d varies over a fixed spline space, but the regularization bears much more of the burden of maintaining a reasonable shape for the curve. We parameterize the drift profile as a function on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and rescale it onto the time interval of the experiment. It is also convenient to constrain d (t) to be orthogonal to constants (and thus the baseline) with respect to the empirical inner product, i.e., P T t=0 d (t) = 0. <p> This decay is typically longer than the corresponding rise [20] (on the order of 10 seconds), and more significantly, the signal often dips below the baseline for an extended period before returning [18]. This dip is typically dealt with by dropping data at the beginnings of task epochs. See <ref> [82, 1, 11] </ref> for more systematic approaches to incorporporating the dip. The importance of the dip is two-fold: (i) a large signal dip during one task epoch distorts the signal in adjacent epoch, complicating analysis; and (ii) the dip may serve as a sensitive discriminator for evaluating local activity. <p> Let S (D; K) denote the orthogonal complement to the constant (with respect to the empirical inner product) in the space of splines of degree D with K knots on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Let S (D; K; ) denote the subset of this space whose knots are fixed at positions 0 &lt; 1 &lt; &lt; K &lt; 1, and let S (D) denote the union of the S (D; K) for K = 0; : : : ; K max .

Reference-contexts: The posterior can be maximized separately over every such sub-model and the results suitably combined. One option is model selection, where a specific model is chosen using a criterion like BIC <ref> [2, 58] </ref>. Since the number of conditions is moderate (e.g., 2-7) in most fMRI experiments, this is generally a practical strategy. An alternative is to average the results across the different models. This makes sense because the parameters are all interpretable in every sub-model.

Reference-contexts: In Pac-Man, the player must attend to the locations of numerous threats and opportunities while planning a path through a maze. The brain has a set of general mechanisms, known as working memory <ref> [3] </ref>, for maintaining such information and intermediate results during processing. Working memory plays a vital role in essentially every cognitive task.

Reference-contexts: The most commonly used is the two sample t-test in which the MR signal values from images associated with any two experimental conditions are compared. Nonparameteric tests, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test <ref> [4, 51] </ref>, also appear frequently in the fMRI literature. A variant of the t-test that is sometimes used, called the split sample t-test [27], classifies a voxel as active only if t-tests carried out separately for data from the first and second halves of the experiment both indicate significance.

Reference-contexts: Another common test statistic is the correlation coefficient of the voxel time-series with a fixed reference curve designed to approximate the shape of the BOLD signal perturbation <ref> [5] </ref>. Whereas the t-test implicitly uses an ideal square wave as the pattern of signal change, the correlation allows a more realistic shape for this curve.

Reference-contexts: This Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) effect is detectable in the MR signal and makes it possible to localize neural activity via the MR phenomenon, albeit indirectly. Functional MRI developed from this observation <ref> [54, 6, 49] </ref> and is now the premier technique for studying brain function. <p> In sections 6 and 8, we will present an alternative that can, in some cases, yield inferences across subjects that do not suffer from these difficulties. 3. Current Methods and The Localization Paradigm 3.1. Development of the Paradigm The goal of the earliest fMRI studies <ref> [6, 49, 54] </ref> was to demonstrate that the BOLD effect could reliably detect and locate activation.

Reference-contexts: The main cost of this is computational, so we have thus far maintained the independent parameterization. Spatial Structure. A common statistical approach for spatial modeling is to put a Markov Ran dom Field (MRF) prior on the underlying structure <ref> [7, 31, 44, 32] </ref>. Besides efficiency of sampling, 53 an advantage of this approach is that the global relationships are specified only through local de-pendence.

Reference-contexts: Posterior Inferences The maximum posterior estimates and asymptotic uncertainties provide a good approximation to the posterior that can be used to address a variety of questions, including but not limited to localization. By using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation techiques <ref> [69, 61, 8, 30] </ref>, we can compute posterior probabilities more accurately and can account for more complex features in the model.

Reference-contexts: But there is more to the structure of working memory than a single limited resource. Current theories [12] also posit that working memory allocation is hierarchically arranged with different pools of resources specialized to particular types of computations. For instance, experiments in <ref> [59, 62, 9] </ref> suggest distinct working memory pools for symbolic and spatial information. Similarly, the model of [46, 13] posits several distinct resource pools for sentence comprehension [47] and others for mental rotation of objects [45].

Reference-contexts: Similar but more recent methods use a general linear model to capture temporal variation, possibly after spatial and temporal smoothing [29, 77]. Finally, if the experimental design alternates periodically between task and control, spectral methods (e.g., F-tests based on periodogram ordinates <ref> [10] </ref>) can be used to test for large power in any frequency band [75, 28]. 3.2. <p> Noise Model. Adding more general noise processes to the model poses no difficulty as long as the likelihood can be reasonably approximated. For example, with ARMA models, we can use a conditional likelihood or compute the likelihood in the spectral domain <ref> [10] </ref>. To incorporate physiological noise, we can add particular spectral components to the noise autocorrelation function whose intensities are included as parameters in the model. Response Variations.

Reference-contexts: As working memory is engaged in a sequence of increasingly difficult tasks, the individual must work harder, until the limit is reached, when there is a serious degradation in performance. But there is more to the structure of working memory than a single limited resource. Current theories <ref> [12] </ref> also posit that working memory allocation is hierarchically arranged with different pools of resources specialized to particular types of computations. For instance, experiments in [59, 62, 9] suggest distinct working memory pools for symbolic and spatial information.

Reference-contexts: These types of data help to clarify the nature and degree of working memory's impact on performance. 8 As an example, consider the "n-back" experiment of <ref> [14] </ref>: A sequence of letters is presented, one at a time, and the subject is instructed to read each aloud and push a button whenever the letter that appears also appeared exactly n letters previously. <p> For example, current cognitive theories explain the results of "n-back" experiments by attributing to each individual a limited supply of the working memory resource <ref> [14, 46] </ref>. The utilization of this resource by a cognitive task is considered a good measure of how "hard" that task is [46]. <p> Another generalization of the t-test is based on an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) model that blocks on time to account for uncontrolled changes over the course of the experiment <ref> [14, 15] </ref>. Here, F-statistics are used to test if specified contrasts among the conditions are non-zero. Similar but more recent methods use a general linear model to capture temporal variation, possibly after spatial and temporal smoothing [29, 77].

Reference-contexts: As part of a "quality control" effort, we examined the performance of the sampling scheme on a sample of voxel time series (from several experiments) with different types of structure. With graphical diagnostics, correlations among parameters, and various standard convergence diagnostics <ref> [16] </ref> based on parallel chains with different starting points, we evaluated the effectiveness of sampling with the configurations we use in practice. These results suggested that the chains are mixing quite well and also that the normal approximation is quite reasonable in most cases.

Reference-contexts: The procedure can accept arbitrarily defined distributions which are then interpolated to compute derivatives, but it is usually desirable for performance reasons to obtain derivatives analytically. Numerical difference approximations, when necessary, are computed by Richardson Extrapolation <ref> [17] </ref> to improve accuracy. We use the BFGS version of the variable metric optimization algorithm [57] while enforcing bounds on the parameters through an active set method. Upon arrival at the maximizer, the algorithm is restarted after a perturbation to the parameters to validate and refine the result.

Reference-contexts: A more effective choice is to take d from an appropriate spline space of some degree D. (Typically, we take D = 3.) A spline of degree D is determined by the number and position of its knots and coefficients in an associated basis of functions <ref> [19] </ref>. Let 0 K K max denote the number of knots and denote the vector of knot locations, where 0 &lt; 1 &lt; &lt; K &lt; 1. <p> The power basis is neither numerically well-conditioned nor structurally convenient, so we reparameterize. A common remedy for the problems of the power basis is to use a B-spline basis <ref> [19] </ref> because these functions provide a stable and localized representation. B-splines allow greater computational efficiency when the number of knots is large, but in the few knot case (see section 5), we use the basis functions generated by orthonormalizing the power basis with respect to the empirical inner product.

Reference-contexts: When the task ends, the signal remains elevated for a time then begins a slow decay back to baseline. This decay is typically longer than the corresponding rise <ref> [20] </ref> (on the order of 10 seconds), and more significantly, the signal often dips below the baseline for an extended period before returning [18]. This dip is typically dealt with by dropping data at the beginnings of task epochs.

Reference-contexts: Using the results of the maximization within each sub-model, we approximate the mixture weights by first approximating Bayes factors [48] using a Laplace approximation [70] (or optionally a localized form of Laplace's method <ref> [21] </ref>) and then combining the Bayes factors with the prior weights to derive posterior probabilities. The standard errors derived from the mixture distribution are larger than those under the individual models, more accurately reflecting the underlying uncertainties. These standard errors are then incorporated into the maps and probabilities described above. <p> When a number of sub-models are to be included in the analysis (e.g., various responsiveness parameters are allowed to take the value 0), the posterior (and likelihood) are maximized for each 46 such model at every voxel. We estimate Bayes Factors with a form of the Laplace approximation <ref> [21] </ref> or with the Schwarz criterion [58]. When parameters are pushed to their bounds and thus a smaller sub-model, the larger but equivalent model is penalized by the full difference in degrees of freedom. We are still assessing more detailed corrections to the Schwarz criterion as in [55].

Reference-contexts: The logic of localization is that the voxels whose MR signals show a response to the task of interest but not the control are involved in the process under study <ref> [22] </ref>. There are, however, several assumptions behind this logic that can complicate the interpretation of localization results; see [?]. Graded Responses. Many theoretical predictions revolve around how the system response changes as the input is varied along a single dimension.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the model for the shape of the hemodynamic response is quite simple and does not account for several important features of the system. See also <ref> [34, 23] </ref> for further discussion. 17 3.3. Failures of the Paradigm: Inferential Relevance A more critical failure is that the localization paradigm limits the range of scientific questions that can be addressed with fMRI data.

Reference-contexts: While it would be ideal if we could integrate these sources of variation into the model, that is not computationally feasible at this time. Instead, we use the FIASCO (Functional Image Analysis Software, Computational Olio) software package <ref> [24] </ref> to carry out all of these pre-processing steps and take the resulting spatio-temporal data as input to our procedures. The FIASCO processing stream involves five core steps: mean correction, baseline correction, 45 deghosting, image registration, and reconstruction.

Reference-contexts: While restraint systems have been devised, these can be quite uncomfortable and even disturbing for subjects. There is consequently a need for numerical techniques to register, or align, a sequence of images after acquisition (see in particular <ref> [25] </ref> but also [76]). These methods are demonstrably quite effective at adjusting for rigid movements within the slice plane, although full three-dimensional registration still needs development.

Reference-contexts: More recent efforts with the involvement of statisticians have attempted to deal with some of these problems. Forman et al. <ref> [26] </ref> developed an adjustment to voxelwise tests, called the cluster size threshold. Here, a voxel is classified active only if its test statistic is above threshold and if the voxel is contained in a contiguous cluster of at least a specified size whose voxelwise statistics are also above threshold.

Johnson et al. [42] generalize this "line process" to allow for more efficient estimation.

Reference-contexts: An equally serious problem is the lack of consensus in the fMRI community on how to choose significance thresholds for the tests. Because of unaccounted features of the noise, theoretical significance levels tend to be inappropriate for fMRI data. While systematic approaches have been proposed <ref> [35] </ref>, thresholds are usually set to arbitrary values, often "by eye". This practice raises the clear danger that the expectations of the investigator will influence the threshold choice, explicitly or implicitly, and thus distort the conclusions. <p> Beyond extending the model, this formulation has further application to the problem of assessing reliability for fMRI methods; see <ref> [35] </ref>. Dependence Between Shape and Responsiveness. Our parameterization of the shape of the hemodynamic response curve does not depend explicitly on the intensity of the response; rather, the shape is scaled appropriately by fl in the activation profile.

Reference-contexts: In section 6, we illustrate some of the possibilities in light of a specific data example. A full case-study using our approach is given in <ref> [36] </ref>. In section 7, we describe the computational techniques that we use to fit the model and implement our inferential procedures. Finally, in section 8, we discuss some more general extensions to the model and some directions for future research. 2. fMRI and Cognitive Neuroscience 2.1. <p> Here, we present an array of representative scientific issues that illustrate the questions neuroscientists face and point to the ways in which fMRI can shed light on the workings of the brain. The analyses presented in section 6 and <ref> [36] </ref> draw from experiments related to these questions. 2.2.1. <p> Genovese et al. <ref> [36] </ref> provides further examples from the study of eye movements. Assessing Monotonicity: Responsiveness. With respect to the responsiveness parameters, the monotonicity question centers on whether fl T 3 fl T 2 fl T 1 &gt; fl Tr for a given voxel. <p> The curves shown in the figure strongly suggest monotonicity. These plots allow scientists to compare the integrated response over the region across conditions or subjects. This technique is explored in more detail in <ref> [36] </ref>. Characterizing the Functional Form. Given monotonicity, the next step is to investigate the specific form of the relationship between response and task difficulty and to compare it with the predictions of cognitive theories. These theories make specific predictions about the functional form of this relationship for each individual. <p> For example, the anatomically specified regions of interest defined in section 6 provide reasonable functional units for comparison. The integrated response measures c (R) over such regions can then be plausibly compared across subjects; see <ref> [36] </ref>. More generally, let G be some functional on the parameter space that does not depend on the explicit coordinate system of the image for a given subject.

Reference-contexts: Prior Information The use of prior information is a critical aspect of inference, particularly in complex or high-dimensional problems, since it enforces substantive constraints and restricts the parameter space to a reasonable form. Note that this is not the exclusive domain of Bayesian statistics <ref> [37, 63] </ref>. In fMRI, there is considerable information regarding the various processes generating the data. Each component of our model has itself been the object of research in the MR literature, and our experience working with these data has yielded further insights.

Reference-contexts: The approximate covariance matrix from the posterior maximization is dilated 47 by a fixed factor and then decomposed into successive conditional distributions using the Cholesky factorization <ref> [38] </ref>. These variances are used to derive the initial jumping widths. The pre-scan phase consists of a brief sampling run during which the rejection rate and average length of moves is recorded in blocks of samples for all of the parameters that require a Metropolis chain. <p> Here, we take advantage of the viewpoint that the drift profile is the parameter, that is, the posterior is invariant under mappings that leave the profile unchanged. The orthogonalized splines work well for the adaptive handling of drift because (i) updates to the knots are computationally efficient <ref> [38] </ref> and (ii) orthogonality of the basis functions allows the components to be treated independently. Both the number K and positions of the knots are allowed to vary, although we enforce an upper bound on the number of knots.

Reference-contexts: Model Jumping For varying the structure of the model in discrete ways, we use the reversible jump framework developed in <ref> [39] </ref>. This allows a single Markov chain to travel among distinct model spaces while maintaining detailed balance; it consequently becomes feasible to work with posteriors that have support in all of these spaces. The resulting inferences can be expressed within a particular model or by averaging across models. <p> This move follows the template given in <ref> [39] </ref> and hence satisfies detailed balance. <p> See <ref> [39] </ref> for a further discussion of this point. When adding, removing, or moving a knot, the effected knot position is selected at random. The basis is then reformatted to make it easier to update that component. <p> We fix this problem by also updating the other components of the profile as part of the move. The dimension matching requirement of <ref> [39] </ref> is satisfied, mixing is improved, and detailed balance is maintained. 51 8. Discussion 8.1. Assessment Our model has several notable advantages over traditional methods for analyzing fMRI data.

Reference-contexts: We select the smoothing parameter in one of two ways. The first is to fix to yield a specified effective degrees of freedom. We define the degrees of freedom as the trace of the effective smoothing 31 matrix <ref> [40] </ref> because this form is the most efficient to compute. One distinction between using the smoothing spline as a general smoother and as a component in a model like this is that the relative size of and 2 determines the degree of smoothing. <p> The maximum posterior estimates are used as the starting point for the chain; if these were not computed, the parameters are initialized by several iterations of a backfitting algorithm <ref> [40] </ref> where each component is estimated in succession using the partial residuals with respect the other components. The pre-scan stage is intended to automate the initialization of the Metropolis candidate distributions. With many thousands of voxels, it is not convenient to monitor and tune the individual chains by hand.

Reference-contexts: For instance, experiments in [59, 62, 9] suggest distinct working memory pools for symbolic and spatial information.

Reference-contexts: For example, current cognitive theories explain the results of "n-back" experiments by attributing to each individual a limited supply of the working memory resource <ref> [14, 46] </ref>. The utilization of this resource by a cognitive task is considered a good measure of how "hard" that task is [46]. <p> For example, current cognitive theories explain the results of "n-back" experiments by attributing to each individual a limited supply of the working memory resource [14, 46]. The utilization of this resource by a cognitive task is considered a good measure of how "hard" that task is <ref> [46] </ref>. As working memory is engaged in a sequence of increasingly difficult tasks, the individual must work harder, until the limit is reached, when there is a serious degradation in performance. But there is more to the structure of working memory than a single limited resource. <p> Current theories [12] also posit that working memory allocation is hierarchically arranged with different pools of resources specialized to particular types of computations. For instance, experiments in [59, 62, 9] suggest distinct working memory pools for symbolic and spatial information.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, trends in the signal render the notion of overall significance less useful.

Nonparameteric tests, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test <ref> [4, 51] </ref>, also appear frequently in the fMRI literature. A variant of the t-test that is sometimes used, called the split sample t-test [27], classifies a voxel as active only if t-tests carried out separately for data from the first and second halves of the experiment both indicate significance.

We use a normal approximation to the joint posterior of fl (with some correction for parameters at the boundary <ref> [55] </ref>) to evaluate posterior probabilities that the response to one condition is greater than to another. For example, Figure 8d shows a map of domination probabilities Pf fl T 3 &gt; fl T r j Y g. <p> When parameters are pushed to their bounds and thus a smaller sub-model, the larger but equivalent model is penalized by the full difference in degrees of freedom.

The Bayes Factors are used to compute posterior probabilities over the sub-models, and results are averaged over the different models. All the parameters maintain a consistent interpretation across all the models, although the hemodynamic shape parameters play no useful role in the null (no response) sub-model. 7.3.

Reference-contexts: The posterior can be maximized separately over every such sub-model and the results suitably combined. One option is model selection, where a specific model is chosen using a criterion like BIC <ref> [2, 58] </ref>. Since the number of conditions is moderate (e.g., 2-7) in most fMRI experiments, this is generally a practical strategy. An alternative is to average the results across the different models.

Reference-contexts: The approach most commonly used to circumvent this difficulty in functional neuroimaging is to map subjects' brains onto a common coordinate system, the Talairach atlas <ref> [66] </ref>, 13 and then average over subjects. The Talairach atlas was generated from a detailed study of six hu-man brains, and the mapping for a given subject is computed using only a few gross measurements of that subject's brain.

Reference-contexts: There has been recent speculation, as yet unproved, that the signal dip appears using all of these techniques, suggesting that the dip reflects changes at the microvasculure level <ref> [67] </ref>. Further research on the source and meaning of the dip is currently underway. The activation profile, a (t) in equation (2), is the combined pattern of signal changes over the course of the experiment.

Acta, </journal> <volume> 714 </volume> <pages> 265-270, </pages> <year> 1982. </year>
Reference-contexts: Through a mechanism that is not fully understood, the metabolic increases cause the local blood vessels to dilate; an inflow of oxygenated blood into the area results. Since oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood have different magnetic properties <ref> [68] </ref>, the MR signal changes slightly as the balance of oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood in a region changes. This Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) effect is detectable in the MR signal and makes it possible to localize neural activity via the MR phenomenon, albeit indirectly.

Reference-contexts: Even if full posterior inferences are desired instead, the estimates from maximization provide a good starting point for MCMC simulations, and the approximate covariance matrix is useful for tuning Metropolis steps <ref> [53, 69] </ref>. Differences Between Conditions. The greatest interest typically centers on the responsiveness parameters (fl) as well as contrasts among them. For simple comparisons, the estimates and standard errors can be used directly to assess the strength of evidence for responsiveness in a 38 particular condition. <p> Posterior Inferences The maximum posterior estimates and asymptotic uncertainties provide a good approximation to the posterior that can be used to address a variety of questions, including but not limited to localization. By using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation techiques <ref> [69, 61, 8, 30] </ref>, we can compute posterior probabilities more accurately and can account for more complex features in the model.

Reference-contexts: Using the results of the maximization within each sub-model, we approximate the mixture weights by first approximating Bayes factors [48] using a Laplace approximation <ref> [70] </ref> (or optionally a localized form of Laplace's method [21]) and then combining the Bayes factors with the prior weights to derive posterior probabilities. The standard errors derived from the mixture distribution are larger than those under the individual models, more accurately reflecting the underlying uncertainties.

Reference-contexts: Functional MRI developed from this observation [54, 6, 49] and is now the premier technique for studying brain function. While other functional neuroimaging modalities, such as Positron Emmission Tomography (PET) <ref> [71] </ref>, were developed earlier, fMRI offers superb sensitivity and an unprecedented combination of good spatial and temporal resolution, without any of the limitations that result from exposing subjects to radioactivity.

Reference-contexts: However, this assumption needs to be tested. The above description specifies how the model captures an isolated response, but there is more to the story. Specifically, there is evidence <ref> [72] </ref> that the profiles from two responses closely spaced in time, combine sub-additively. This corresponds to a marginally decreasing response in the presence of substantial vasal dilation. Nonetheless, we do expect signal from two combined responses to be at least as large as either of the two alone. <p> Dependence Between Shape and Responsiveness. Our parameterization of the shape of the hemodynamic response curve does not depend explicitly on the intensity of the response; rather, the shape is scaled appropriately by fl in the activation profile. There is some recent evidence <ref> [72] </ref>, however, that the shape varies with amplitude in a non-additive way. For instance, large responses appear to exhibit a broader plateau and later decay. As such relationships are clarified by further research, we can adjust the model to include this dependence.

Reference-contexts: on K over f0; : : : ; K max g, let drift ( j K) be a diffuse prior on the appropriate simplex, and set drift ( j K; ) to a standard Sobolev prior over S (D; K; ); The first strategy corresponds to a modified smoothing spline <ref> [73] </ref>. The knots for a smoothing spline are usually placed at every data point, but sufficient flexibility is often gained with 1/2 to 1/4 as many depending on the length of the time series.

Reference-contexts: Hence, a natural approach is to compare the mean signal in the task and control conditions using a statistical hypothesis test, applied voxel by voxel. Although other classification procedures have been considered <ref> [74, 56] </ref>, this testing-based approach is the statistical analysis used by the majority of fMRI researchers. A variety of testing procedures has been employed in fMRI, and although most of these have 14 a statistical heritage, few if any were introduced to the field by statisticians.

Failures of the Paradigm: Model Assumptions While the various hypothesis tests often give reasonable results and can reliably detect large signal changes, there are several inherent complexities in fMRI that undermine the effectiveness of these procedures.

Reference-contexts: While restraint systems have been devised, these can be quite uncomfortable and even disturbing for subjects. There is consequently a need for numerical techniques to register, or align, a sequence of images after acquisition (see in particular [25] but also <ref> [76] </ref>). These methods are demonstrably quite effective at adjusting for rigid movements within the slice plane, although full three-dimensional registration still needs development.

Reference-contexts: Here, F-statistics are used to test if specified contrasts among the conditions are non-zero. Similar but more recent methods use a general linear model to capture temporal variation, possibly after spatial and temporal smoothing <ref> [29, 77] </ref>.
