Reference-contexts: By using B-splines a nicely shaped solution minimizing a certain fairness functional can be found easily using standard tools from linear algebra. 1. Regularity of Degenerated Patches Consider n 2 INnf1; 2g analytical surface segments over the unit square ! := <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 x j : ! 3 u := (u; v) 7! p;q=0 pq u p v q 2 IR 3 ; j = 1; : : : ; n (1:1) joining parametrically smooth according to x j (0; t) = x j+1 (t; 0) ; x j v (t; <p> : ! 3 u := (u; v) 7! p;q=0 pq u p v q 2 IR 3 ; j = 1; : : : ; n (1:1) joining parametrically smooth according to x j (0; t) = x j+1 (t; 0) ; x j v (t; 0) ; t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> : (1:2) Here and subsequently, the index j runs from 1 to n and has to be understood modulo n. <p> Now, in order to show injectivity of x, consider two points u 1 ; u 2 2 U " with x (u 1 ) = x (u 2 ). Define r := u 2 u 1 and s (t) := r x (u 1 + tr) ; t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ; (1:17) then s (0) = s (1). <p> := d b d (u) := [b 0 d (u)] : The Bezier patch x B corresponding to a (d+1)fi (d+1)-matrix B of Bezier points B pq 2 IR 3 is defined by x B (u; v) = b d (u) B b d (v) T ; (u; v) 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 : (2:2) The following Lemma provides necessary and sufficient criteria for Bezier patches matching Definition 1.1. Here and subsequently it is assumed that the singular point is located at (u; v) = (0; 0). <p> Here, the segments are assumed to be quadrilateral Bezier patches and so the domain is uniform in the sense that it consists of copies of only one set, namely the unit square ! := <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 , hence = ! fi I. According to Section 1, vertices of order 4 are called regular. Otherwise, they are called extraordinary. <p> fi (1 ! k and the kernel of ^ Q k is non-trivial if and only if k 2 f0; 1; n 1g, thus ^ P 2 = = ^ P n2 = 0 : (6:8) For k = 0 we obtain ^q 0 := ker ^ Q 0 = <ref> [1; 1; 1] </ref> T and ^ P 0 := ^q 0 [a 0 0 ; a 0 2 ].

Reference-contexts: The idea is to use exclusively parametrical smoothness conditions and to overcome the related well known difficulties by introducing surface patches which are degenerated in the sense that their partial derivatives vanish at extraordinary vertices. This method was proposed in [11,12] and <ref> [13] </ref> and verified strictly in [14] for polynomial patches. Here it is shown that the method can be generalized to degenerated patches based on arbitrary analytical basis functions thus extending the range of applicability to most spline models currently in use. <p> They are weaker than (1.2) but still guarantee smooth joints in the sense of differential geometry. The idea of accepting the trivial solution (1.6) can be found in <ref> [13] </ref> and [11,12], however, without being verified rigorously.
