Abstract: A fundamental goal of research in molecular biology is to understand protein structure. Protein crystallography is currently the most successful method for determining the three-dimensional (3D) conformation of a protein, yet it remains labor intensive and relies on an expert's ability to derive and evaluate a protein scene model. In this paper, the problem of protein structure determination is formulated as an exercise in scene analysis. A computational methodology is presented in which a 3D image of a protein is segmented into a graph of critical points. Bayesian and certainty factor approaches are described and used to analyze critical point graphs and identify meaningful substructures, such as ff-helices and fi-sheets. Results of applying the methodologies to protein images at low and medium resolution are reported. The research is related to approaches to representation, segmentation and classification in vision, as well as to top-down approaches to protein structure prediction.

Reference-contexts: Modifications to the current scoring function, to incorporate properties available in the electron density map and critical point graph representations, are being implemented in order to customize this approach to the information available from our topological analysis <ref> (Baxter, Steeg, Lathrop, Glasgow, & Fortier, 1996) </ref>. 7. Conclusions It was reported in this paper that a topological approach can effectively be applied to the segmentation of protein images into their meaningful parts at low- and medium-resolution.

Reference-contexts: A distinct advantage of molecular scene analysis, over many applications in machine vision, is the regularity of chemical structures and the availability of previously determined molecules in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) <ref> (Bernstein, Koetzle, Williams, & Jr., 1977) </ref>. <p> Computations were first performed on calculated maps reconstructed from available structural data in order to generate a procedure for the further analysis of experimental maps. Three protein structures: Phospholipase A2 (1BP2), Ribonu-clease T1 complex (1RNT) and Trypsin inhibitor (4PTI), retrieved from the PDB <ref> (Bernstein et al., 1977) </ref>, were considered. These structures are composed of 123, 104 and 53 amino acid residues, respectively, and were chosen because of the quality of the data sets.

Reference-contexts: Several models for the representation and segmentation of protein structures were considered. These included a generalized cylinder model <ref> (Binford, 1971) </ref>, and a skeletonization method (Greer, 1974; Hilditch, 1969). We choose a topological approach, which has been previously applied in both chemistry and machine vision.

Reference-contexts: This would be complementary to the bottom-up scene analysis provided by the topological approach described in this paper.

Reference-contexts: Two methods for determining confidence values for secondary structure assessment were studied and applied to the problem of secondary structure identification: 1) a Bayesian, or Minimum Message Length (MML) approach, similar to that previously used in protein substructure classification in <ref> (Dowe, Allison, Dix, Hunter, Wallace, & Edgoose, 1996) </ref>, and 2) an approach similar to that used in expert systems such as MYCIN (Shortliffe, 1976).

Considerable research has been carried out on extracting 3D information from one or more 2D images. A review of the application of stereo vision to sets of 2D images can be found in <ref> (Faugeras, 1993) </ref>. The principles of stereo vision have also been applied to moving images (Zhang & Faugeras, 1992). Range data provides explicit depth information about visible surfaces in the form of a 2D array (depth map).

Reference-contexts: In the case at hand, we have 11 dimensions instead of 2, and not all of the dimensions are best modeled by simple Gaussians. It is generally accepted that angular data should be modeled by one of the circular distributions such as the von Mises distribution <ref> (Fisher, 1993) </ref>. Two independence assumptions, crucial to computational efficiency and data efficiency, underlie this approach: 1. Within a given class, the attributes characterizing a segment are mutually indepen dent. 2. The separate datapoints, each corresponding to a segment, are mutually independent.

Reference-contexts: In conjunction with this earlier project, a topological approach to the representation and analysis 132 Analysis of Three-Dimensional Protein Images resolution of protein electron density maps was implemented in a program called ORCRIT <ref> (Johnson, 1977) </ref>. Recent studies suggest that this approach can also be applied to the segmentation of medium-resolution protein images (Leherte, Baxter, Glasgow, & Fortier, 1994a; Leherte, Fortier, Glasgow, & Allen, 1994b). <p> In chemistry, the approach has proven useful for characterizing the shape properties of the electron density distribution through the location and attributes of its critical points (points where the gradient of the electron density is equal to zero) <ref> (Johnson, 1977) </ref>. 5. <p> Within the framework of the molecular scene analysis project, the use of critical points is being extended for the analysis of medium and low-resolution maps of proteins. The topological approach to the segmentation of proteins was initially implemented by Johnson in the computer program ORCRIT <ref> (Johnson, 1977) </ref>. By first locating and then connecting the critical points, this program generates a representation that 135 Leherte, Glasgow, Baxter, Steeg, & Fortier function . captures the skeleton and the volumetric features of a protein image.

Reference-contexts: Considerable research has been carried out on extracting 3D information from one or more 2D images. A review of the application of stereo vision to sets of 2D images can be found in (Faugeras, 1993). The principles of stereo vision have also been applied to moving images <ref> (Zhang & Faugeras, 1992) </ref>. Range data provides explicit depth information about visible surfaces in the form of a 2D array (depth map). Depending on the application, both surface or/and volume fitting techniques are applied to these images.
