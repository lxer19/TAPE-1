Abstract: We propose temporal extent, a concept that can be used to produce summary or abstracted information about the values of temporal attributes in a database relation or class of objects. In its simplest form, the temporal extent is a one-dimensional interval representing the minimum and maximum time points of the instances in a class. More generally, a set of temporal intervals are used to capture the temporal coverage of a set of temporal objects or class. The summary provides information about the class in a compact form that can be used concurrently with statistical abstraction mechanisms for approximate query answering and for fast browsing.

Reference-contexts: A model for temporal support in database management systems (DBMS) for global change research has been previously proposed [11]. This model is based on a synthesis of previous work, including <ref> [1, 4, 14, 15, 16] </ref>. One distinction is that [11] specifically considered the requirements of global change studies [19]. As an extension to this work, we introduce the concept of temporal extent derived from the spatial bounding box, statistical scatter range, and histograms.

Reference-contexts: The presence of outliers, and the fact that range only reflects the extremes of data presents another disadvantage. 2.2 Multi-Interval Extent Some of the above problems can be alleviated by dividing the temporal extent into several intervals <ref> [2] </ref>. The problem then is to determine the size of each interval in the extent. Histograms have a similar interval conundrum. Three solutions were offered in [9]: equal width, equal height, and variable width. Unfortunately the histogram analogy is not an exact match with temporal extent. <p> Base Data represents a single interval in the Temporal Extent 50 Years 100 Years 1 Year 100 Years Gapsize Max.

Statistically abstracted data together with temporal extent are the basis for meta-data information attached to classes of temporal objects. Within Gaea, these meta-data are used as a basis for data abstraction generation and recall [7], approximate query answering and as a browsing aid: 1.

Reference-contexts: There are a number of disadvantages to using range to represent scatter characteristics <ref> [3] </ref>. For example, the size of the temporal extent tends to increase with the number of instances being summarized.

Reference-contexts: attributes is beyond the scope of this work, it would be reasonable to ask what kind of extent could be created for both space and time? The combination of a spatial bounding box and temporal interval would result in a spatio-temporal extent similar to the spatio-temporal bounding box proposed in <ref> [8] </ref>. Multi-interval spatio-temporal extents together with statistical abstractions techniques can be a powerful tool for efficient browsing and querying of very large scientific data sets. This is the subject of our future and on-going work.

Histograms organize frequency counts of a single variable into intervals organized by variable values. <p> Level ... Level 3 Level 2 Level 1 Decreasing Detail Increasing Performance Level 0 2.3 BUILD and UPDATE To manage and maintain a temporal extent we used two operators previously proposed to produce a statistical profile of a database <ref> [9] </ref>. Those operators are: BUILD used to create a temporal extent, and UPDATE used to modify a temporal extent. The BUILD operator can be quite expensive, as it must process all instances in the class. The UPDATE operator provides a low cost alternative to maintaining the extent. <p> If no values are found, the gapsize is enlarged, and the data rescanned. This process continues until a new extent is calculated. 2.4 Hierarchical Extent Many database systems treat statistical information as special metadata <ref> [9, 10, 12] </ref>. This is unfortunate because metadata are data. If metadata are treated and stored like ordinary database information, then the same abstractions that are performed on regular data can be performed on the metadata. <p> These measurements span over a century from 1853 to 1990. 3.1 Implementing Single Interval Extent Single Interval Temporal Extent was implemented for both BUILD and UPDATE operations which are discussed in <ref> [9] </ref>. As an example, consider a class asiaSmall with a temporal extent.

Temporal extent is considered to be part of the meta-data attached to the class definitions and is used in query processing and browsing. The Gaea prototype uses Postgres <ref> [17] </ref> as its backend DBMS. This design decision enabled us to concentrate on providing meta-data management capabilities, while allowing Postgres to handle data manipulation details. Additionally, the Postgres provides certain features that facilitated the implementation of a temporal ADT.
