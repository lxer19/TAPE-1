Title: INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATION OF MULTIDIMENSIONAL DATA  
Author: CHANDRAJIT L. BAJAJ 
Address: West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science, Purdue University,  
Abstract: Interactive data visualization concerns the real time manipulation of sampled and computed data for comprehensive display. The goal of the visualization is to bring to the user a deeper understanding of the data as well as the underlying physical laws and properties. In this survey paper I focus on two problem areas relating to interactive data visualization. The first is in data reduction and dealing with the computation of error-bounded reduced detail meshes with topological correctness. The second is in data reconstruction from scattered point scans and dealing with accurate spline models which support interactive querying and manipulation. For each of these problem areas I survey some of the related research and simultaneously present some of our own recent results.

Algebraic surface splines have many attractive qualities, from the closure properties with respect to important modeling operations such as intersection and blending, to a high design flexibility for a relatively low algebraic degree [6].

Reference-contexts: Much of the work for functional surfaces has been related to mesh reduction for dense geographical data. Lee <ref> [4] </ref> contains an overview and comparison of point insertion and point deletion methods for functional surfaces. In this context, the function is that of height, and the goal is to accurately model a terrain using the fewest number of elements possible.

Reference-contexts: Such methods are frequently used in real-time rendering systems such as a flight simulator, so that objects which are far away and appear small to the user may be rendered using a coarse resolution model <ref> [5] </ref>. As the object nears the user, the model can be smoothly blended to a more detailed resolution. Such methods would also be very useful in a navigable visualization environment. We describe a method to generate nested sets of models and interpolate between them.

Reference-contexts: The problem of computing a polyhedron of minimal surface area is the 3D version of the minimal perimeter polygon, and is conjectured to be NP-hard as well. Boissonnat <ref> [9] </ref> proposes two methods to build a triangulation having the given points as vertices. The first method is "local" and surface-based, whereas the second one is "global" and volume-based. Following his first approach, one starts with creating an edge between the two closest points.

Reference-contexts: The author suggests a heuristic to select which tetrahedron to remove. Choi et al. <ref> [10] </ref> propose a method to grow a triangulation, starting from an initial triangle, based on the assumption that there exists a point from which all the points of the surface are visible. After a triangulation is built, it is improved by edge swapping based on a smoothness criterion.

Reference-contexts: This data is an approximate sampling of the signed-distance function ffi (x; y; z).

Goshtasby <ref> [12] </ref> introduces a new representation for parametric curves and surfaces, using Gaussian bases in rational form, and shows applications to the recovery of shape from noisy image data.

Reference-contexts: The fl-graph is progressively constricted (i.e. tetrahedra having boundary faces are deleted) until the boundary of the fl-graph is a closed surface, passing through all the given points. Hoppe et al. <ref> [14] </ref> use an approach based on normal propagation to correctly orient the approximated manifold. Their method next constructs a regular subdivision of a parallelepiped containing the data points into cubes. <p> Then ffi (p) = 0 will recover the surface M .

Reference-contexts: Objects of genus greater than 0, or objects with a convoluted geometry, require multiple point of views to be completely scanned. Moore and Warren <ref> [17] </ref> describe a method for fitting algebraic surfaces to scattered dense data. Their method is adaptive and able in principle of dealing with complex geometry and topology. The fitting begins with a uniform mesh of tetrahedral elements that fill a region containing the data points. <p> Then ffi (p) = 0 will recover the surface M . When only discrete data on a surface is available, an approximate signed-distance can be defined in some appropriate way (see e.g. <ref> [17, 14, 8] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Terzopoulos et al. [23] use an elastically-deformable model with intrinsic forces that induce a preference for symmetric shapes, and apply them to the reconstruction of shapes from images. The 8 algorithm is also capable of inferring non-rigid motion of an object from time-varying images. Pentland and Sclaroff <ref> [19] </ref> adopt an approach based on the finite element method and parametric surfaces. They start with a simple solid model (like a sphere or cylinder) and attach virtual "springs" between each data point and a point on the surface. The equilibrium condition of this dynamic system is the reconstructed shape.

Reference-contexts: An early application of this method is described by Shmitt et al. <ref> [22] </ref>. The input points are assumed organized in a rectangular grid, and are adaptively fitted using Bernstein-Bezier parametric bicubic patches, joined to form a G 1 continuous surface. The approximation process begins with a rough approximating surface and uses subdivision to achieve the needed level of accuracy.

Reference-contexts: If error criteria are satisfied, the vertex is deleted and the resulting hole is retriangulated. There is no error propagation, and therefore no guarantee on the amount of accumulated error in the final representation. Hinker, et al <ref> [31] </ref> perform "geometric optimization" on triangular surface meshes be grouping faces into contiguous sets which are nearly co-planar, deleting points which are interior or along nearly linear edges, and retriangulating the resulting hole.

Reference-contexts: Point repulsion is adjusted based on estimated curvature of the surface, providing an adaptive triangulation which maintains geometric features.

Reference-contexts: In the case of arbitrary surface meshes (geometric mesh reduction), vertex deletion is the most natural approach. For functional surfaces, both insertion and deletion techniques have been considered. Schroeder, et al [38], compute reduced representations for dense triangular surface meshes such as those computed by Marching Cubes <ref> [33] </ref> or similar isosurfacing algorithms. Vertices in the dense mesh are examined and classified based on geometric features in the triangulation surrounding the vertex. If error criteria are satisfied, the vertex is deleted and the resulting hole is retriangulated.

Reference-contexts: Through the use of wavelet transforms <ref> [35, 28] </ref>, a hierarchical representation of functions can be obtained by repeatedly breaking the function into a coarser representation in addition to a set of perturbation coefficients which allow the full recovery of the original representation from the coarse representation.

Reference-contexts: During reconstruction from the wavelet representation, sufficiently small wavelet coefficients can be left out, resulting in a coarser approximation to the original data, with a known bound on the amount of error [34, 26, 39].

Reference-contexts: Muraki [36] applies wavelets in 3D to compute multiresolution models of 3D volume data. Isosurfaces and planar cross sections of the resulting data show little change in image quality with large reductions in the amount of data representing the volume. 2.4 Our Current Research In <ref> [37] </ref> we extend geometric reduction methods to arbitrary surfaces in 3D and to any number of data variables defined over the mesh by developing a algorithm for mapping from a surface mesh to a reduced representation and measuring the introduced error in both the geometry and the multivariate data.

Reference-contexts: In the case of arbitrary surface meshes (geometric mesh reduction), vertex deletion is the most natural approach. For functional surfaces, both insertion and deletion techniques have been considered. Schroeder, et al <ref> [38] </ref>, compute reduced representations for dense triangular surface meshes such as those computed by Marching Cubes [33] or similar isosurfacing algorithms. Vertices in the dense mesh are examined and classified based on geometric features in the triangulation surrounding the vertex.
