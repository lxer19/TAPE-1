Title: A General NP-Completeness Theorem  
Author: Nimrod Megiddo 
Date: (Revised)  
Abstract: A detailed model of a random access computation over an abstract domain is presented, and the existence of an NP-complete problem is proven under broad conditions which unify Cook's theorem and recent results in the real number model by Blum, Shub and Smale.

Reference-contexts: There are many equivalent models of computation. I have chosen to generalize the model of a RAM as described by Aho, Hopcroft and Ullman <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> , so I try to stay as close as possible to the notation used by those authors. A RAM has a memory and two tapes: a read-only input tape and a write-only output tape.
