Title: A Method for Identifying Splice Sites and Translational Start Sites in

Abstract: This paper describes a new method for determining the consensus sequences that signal the start of translation and the boundaries between exons and introns (donor and acceptor sites) in eukaryotic mRNA. The method takes into account the dependencies between adjacent bases, in contrast to the usual technique of considering each position independently. When coupled with a dynamic program to compute the most likely sequence, new consensus sequences emerge. The consensus sequence information is summarized in conditional probability matrices which, when used to locate signals in uncharacter-ized genomic DNA, have greater sensitivity and specificity than conventional matrices. Species-specific versions of these matrices are especially effective at distinguishing true and false sites.

Reference-contexts: These matrices form the basis of an algorithm for signal detection that is equivalent to a first-order Markov chain method. Many previous studies have attempted to characterize the sequences around the start, donor, and acceptor sites in eukaryotic organisms.

The consensus patterns from the CP matrices are nearly identical to Kozak's consensus sequence, (GCC)GCC (A/G)CCATGG <ref> [1] </ref> and to Senapathy et al.'s [3] reported donor and acceptor sequences. The only difference is in the (GCC) at position -9 in the start sequence, where the new CP matrix indicates ACA.

They collected a large set of genes, and carefully edited the set so as to remove sequences that were likely to contain erroneous annotation or to represent non-standard splicing mechanisms (e.g., alternative splicing or AT-AC splicing).
