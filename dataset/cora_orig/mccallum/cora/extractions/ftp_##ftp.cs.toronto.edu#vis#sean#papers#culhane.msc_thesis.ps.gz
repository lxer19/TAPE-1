Reference-contexts: The focus of this investigation will be on this particular attention scheme. Cognitive psychologists have been studying attentional behaviour in human subjects for many years [12, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]. Furthermore, many researchers have addressed the issue of neural processing related to attention <ref> [1, 10, 14, 23] </ref>. However, few attentional models for computer vision have been developed. Most computational vision research has implicitly assumed either a strictly serial or a strictly parallel paradigm. <p> The parallel nature of the model's structure may eventually lead to an implementation on supporting parallel hardware that has real-time 3 performance. Tsotsos' model incorporates ideas proposed by Koch and Ullman [19]. Previous implementations of visual attention mechanisms by Chapman [9], Anderson and van Essen <ref> [1] </ref>, Califano [8], Mozer [24, 25] and Sandon [30] all have some basic similarities to the prototype examined in this study, but each of these schemes exhibits significant shortcomings such that Tsotsos' model is preferable. The input to Tsotsos' prototype is not limited to visual stimuli. <p> object, as it is attended to from coarser to finer resolutions, which Tsotsos' model does and which seems to be in monkey visual cortex as observed by Moran and Desimone [23]. 2.2.3 Other Models Anderson and van Essen propose the idea of "shifter networks" to explain attentional effects in vision <ref> [1] </ref>. Their theory requires a two-phase process. First, a series of microshifts map the attention focus onto the nearest cortical module; then a series of macroshifts switches dynamically between pairs of modules at the next stage, continuing in this fashion until an attentional centre is reached.

Reference-contexts: Julesz has also shown in studies of texture discrimination that only a limited set of features, termed textons, can be detected in parallel <ref> [2, 17] </ref>. Among the features that may be detected in parallel are colour, orientation of line segments and certain shape parameters such as curvature [18, 32]. Duncan provides an alternate theory to explain the reaction time dependencies of visual search [12].

Reference-contexts: In the late 1950's, the attention theory received its most conspicuous and far-reaching boost by the work of Broadbent <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. Broadbent's theory of selective attention suggests a filter mechanism in which information from all channels is initially processed in parallel; at some point in the system, the information converges to a limited capacity channel.

Reference-contexts: A Laplacian pyramid is then constructed from the Gaussian pyramid. The difference between successive levels in the Gaussian pyramid becomes a level in the Laplacian pyramid. This configuration is a 16 complete image representation in that the levels may be "expanded" and summed to recover the original image exactly <ref> [5, 11] </ref>. A rudimentary fovea is formed within the Laplacian pyramid. At the lowest frequency level, the foveal region encompasses the whole image and represents the capability of peripheral vision to resolve low resolution patterns over the full field of view.

Reference-contexts: Multiresolution techniques are a practical and elegant means by which attention may be applied to guide bottom-up processing. Burt identifies the three key elements of all multiresolution models <ref> [6] </ref>. The first element is the high-resolution fovea area of the eye, which provides the detail necessary to achieve an accurate interpretation. The second is peripheral vision, which covers a broad field of view and generates coarse-resolution information utilized to direct the fovea.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the capability for multiple scale analysis is added to this basic structure, using multiple data paths and scale transformations. Input to each data path is from the appropriate layer of a Gaussian pyramid <ref> [7] </ref> which is computed by repeated smoothing and reducing of the intensity image.

Reference-contexts: The parallel nature of the model's structure may eventually lead to an implementation on supporting parallel hardware that has real-time 3 performance. Tsotsos' model incorporates ideas proposed by Koch and Ullman [19]. Previous implementations of visual attention mechanisms by Chapman [9], Anderson and van Essen [1], Califano <ref> [8] </ref>, Mozer [24, 25] and Sandon [30] all have some basic similarities to the prototype examined in this study, but each of these schemes exhibits significant shortcomings such that Tsotsos' model is preferable. The input to Tsotsos' prototype is not limited to visual stimuli. <p> Thus, full resolution is retained at the centre and resolution decreases towards the periphery. Califano, Kjeldsen and Bolle outline a multiresolution system in which the input is processed simultaneously at a coarse resolution throughout the image and at a finer resolution within a small "window" <ref> [8] </ref>. An attention control mechanism dynamically determines the "best" location for the next fixation. This is not a pyramidal approach to multiresolution processing, as the entire image is not processed at all resolutions. This approach integrates both data-driven and model-driven strategies for directing the fovea.

Both of these mechanisms are related to phenomena in perceptual grouping and "Gestalt effects", which occur as a function of object similarity and spatial proximity. Chapman <ref> [9] </ref> has recently implemented a system based on the idea of a pyramid model of attention introduced by Koch and Ullman. Chapman's model places a log-depth tree above a saliency map. Similar to the Tsotsos model, at each level nodes receive activation from nodes below.

Reference-contexts: Tsotsos has proposed such a mechanism [40, 41]. The focus of this investigation will be on this particular attention scheme. Cognitive psychologists have been studying attentional behaviour in human subjects for many years <ref> [12, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38] </ref>.

Duncan provides an alternate theory to explain the reaction time dependencies of visual search <ref> [12] </ref>. Setting aside the parallel versus serial distinction, Duncan claims that the search times depend only on two measures, the similarity between the target and the nontarget distractors (T-NT similarity), and the similarity of the 21 nontargets (NT-NT similarity).

Reference-contexts: In short, attention simplifies computation 1 and reduces the amount of processing. Computer vision models which incorporate parallel processing are prevalent in the literature. This strategy appears appropriate for the vast amounts of input data that must be processed at the low-level <ref> [13, 42] </ref>. However, complete parallelism is not possible because it requires too many processors and connections [26, 40]. Instead, a balance must be found between processor-intensive parallel techniques and time-intensive serial techniques.

Reference-contexts: The concept of attention can also be found in even the earliest writings on perception. Helmholtz believed that conscious or voluntary effort may focus attention on a particular spot in the visual field <ref> [15] </ref>, and this led to the "attentional spotlight" idea that is widespread in models of perception. In the late 1950's, the attention theory received its most conspicuous and far-reaching boost by the work of Broadbent [3, 4].

Reference-contexts: Input to each data path is from the appropriate layer of a Gaussian pyramid [7] which is computed by repeated smoothing and reducing of the intensity image. In the earlier models of Hinton <ref> [16] </ref> and Mozer [24], the input to the attention layer is the sum of activation of all primitive feature detectors at each location and a WTA mechanism inhibits all but the strongest activation.

Reference-contexts: The parallel nature of the model's structure may eventually lead to an implementation on supporting parallel hardware that has real-time 3 performance. Tsotsos' model incorporates ideas proposed by Koch and Ullman <ref> [19] </ref>. Previous implementations of visual attention mechanisms by Chapman [9], Anderson and van Essen [1], Califano [8], Mozer [24, 25] and Sandon [30] all have some basic similarities to the prototype examined in this study, but each of these schemes exhibits significant shortcomings such that Tsotsos' model is preferable. <p> Information is represented as a pattern of activation over the units in a module, whose values may accumulate and dissipate with time. Processing occurs by the propagation of signals from one module to another. In 1985, Koch and Ullman proposed a model for selective visual attention <ref> [19] </ref>. In their model, elementary features such as colour and orientation may be represented in parallel in different topographical maps, called the early representation. This approach has support from studies in psychophysics and physiology. <p> The pass zone permeates the winners at each level and the inhibit zone encompasses those elements at each level that competed in the WTA process. This algorithm is similar to the basic idea proposed by Koch and Ullman <ref> [19] </ref>. One important difference is that this scheme does not rely on a saliency map. Another distinction is that a modified WTA update rule is used which allows for multiple winners and does not attenuate the winning inputs 1 .

Reference-contexts: In addition, the time required for Chapman's model is logarithmic in the maximum number of elements, making it impractical for high-resolution images. Furthermore, the time required to process any item in a sensory field is dependent on its location, which is contrary to recent psychological evidence <ref> [20] </ref>. The Tsotsos model requires constant time irrespective of the locations of the sensory items. Mozer describes a model of attention based on iterative relaxation [24]. Attentional selection is performed by a network of simple computing units that constructs a variable-diameter "spotlight" on the retinotopic representation.

Reference-contexts: The following sections describe the more well-established theories. 2.2.1 Connectionist Models Connectionist models of visual attention are just beginning to appear in the literature. Thus far, most network models proposed only explain individual pieces of attention. As LaBerge <ref> [21] </ref> points out, connectionists should proceed somewhat cautiously in the incorporation of selection into their models.

Reference-contexts: Marr suggests the following selection criterion for RF sizes: choose a given size if receptive fields of slightly smaller size give an appreciably smaller response and receptive fields that are larger do not give appreciably larger responses <ref> [22] </ref>. Marr 45 A 256 fi 256 receptive field with average = 127.39. A weighting function should not favour this RF over a 1 fi 1 RF with an average of 255 (a bright single-element RF). notes, however, that more than one receptive field size may satisfy this require-ment.

Their theory requires a two-phase process. <p> For example, there are approximately thirty visual areas in which the average connectivity between neurons appears to be about 1000 for both fan-out and fan-in. [44]. Additionally, there is a hierarchical organization connecting these areas [43]. Desimone cites evidence for two different attentional mechanisms in two different neural loci <ref> [23, 45] </ref>. In the area of the visual cortex known as V4, the behaviour is that of a "local" attentional mechanism, in which stimuli within a limited, contiguous region compete for attention, whereas those from spatially distant locations do not interact.

The input to Tsotsos' prototype is not limited to visual stimuli. <p> The time can be quite large if there are similar regions of activity that are widely separated. For example, Mozer reports that his scheme took up to 100 iterations to settle on a 36 fi 6 image <ref> [25] </ref>. These schemes are clearly not suited to real-world high-resolution images. 2.2.2 Multiresolution Models Multiresolution processing is not only useful in limiting the computational time, as it has been widely recognized, but may be crucial to converting the entire vision problem into a tractable, stable one.

Reference-contexts: Computer vision models which incorporate parallel processing are prevalent in the literature. This strategy appears appropriate for the vast amounts of input data that must be processed at the low-level [13, 42]. However, complete parallelism is not possible because it requires too many processors and connections <ref> [26, 40] </ref>. Instead, a balance must be found between processor-intensive parallel techniques and time-intensive serial techniques.

Reference-contexts: The attention shifts discussed throughout this paper have been covert forms of attention in which different regions of the visual input have been attended. It is experimentally well established that these covert attention shifts occur in humans <ref> [27] </ref>. In a similar way, the human visual system has special fast mechanisms called saccades for moving the fovea to different spatial targets (overt attention).

Processing within the PDP framework is assumed to take place in a system of connected modules. Each module consists of an ensemble of elementary processing units.

Reference-contexts: Tsotsos' model incorporates ideas proposed by Koch and Ullman [19]. Previous implementations of visual attention mechanisms by Chapman [9], Anderson and van Essen [1], Califano [8], Mozer [24, 25] and Sandon <ref> [30] </ref> all have some basic similarities to the prototype examined in this study, but each of these schemes exhibits significant shortcomings such that Tsotsos' model is preferable. The input to Tsotsos' prototype is not limited to visual stimuli. This feature makes this system applicable to many different sensory modalities. <p> It is this "higher level of cognition" that directly controls the "conceptually-driven" guidance. Sandon describes a network model of visual attention which also uses an iterative rule but performs the computation at several spatial scales simultaneously <ref> [30] </ref>. Shape features and spatial location of objects are represented in separate arrays and these two sources of information are combined multiplicatively in order to recognize objects.

Reference-contexts: The focus of attention falls on the longest line first 1 .

The prototype parameters for these first set of edge experiments were: minRF = 10, maxRF = 175, ff = 10, fi = 1:03, and 5 hierarchy levels with resolution 32 fi 32, 80 fi 80, 144 fi 144, 208 fi 208 and 256 fi 256.

Reference-contexts: Julesz has also shown in studies of texture discrimination that only a limited set of features, termed textons, can be detected in parallel [2, 17]. Among the features that may be detected in parallel are colour, orientation of line segments and certain shape parameters such as curvature <ref> [18, 32] </ref>. Duncan provides an alternate theory to explain the reaction time dependencies of visual search [12].

Reference-contexts: Vision systems that have no task guidance, and must provide a description of everything in the scene at a high level of detail as opposed to searching and describing only a sub-image for a pre-specified item, have been shown to be computationally intractable <ref> [39] </ref>. Thus, task guidance, or attention, plays a critical role in a system that is hoped to function in real time. In short, attention simplifies computation 1 and reduces the amount of processing. Computer vision models which incorporate parallel processing are prevalent in the literature. <p> These types of operation appear in all levels of vision systems, from the earliest to the highest. Tsotsos <ref> [39] </ref> distinguishes "task-directed visual search", in which the target is explicitly known in advance, from "bottom-up visual search", in which it is not. <p> Formally, this is exactly one of the constraints Tsotsos proposes for visual search: given more than one match with approximately the same error, choose the largest one <ref> [39] </ref>. In the implementation of the attention model, this favouring of larger RFs of comparable value is accomplished by multiplying the weighted averages of all RFs by a normalizing factor that is a function of the size of the RF.

Reference-contexts: Computer vision models which incorporate parallel processing are prevalent in the literature. This strategy appears appropriate for the vast amounts of input data that must be processed at the low-level [13, 42]. However, complete parallelism is not possible because it requires too many processors and connections <ref> [26, 40] </ref>. Instead, a balance must be found between processor-intensive parallel techniques and time-intensive serial techniques. <p> Herein lies the role of attention: to tune the early visual input by selecting a small portion of the visual stimuli to process.

Cognitive psychologists have been studying attentional behaviour in human subjects for many years [12, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]. <p> As a result, many computer scientists use findings of biological vision research as a basis or justification for their proposals and models. 1.2 Background This study examines a new computational model for visual attention introduced by Tsotsos <ref> [40, 41] </ref> as it applies to early and intermediate levels of visual computation. The vast amount of computation required is fully integrated into the derivation of this model. <p> At the present time few, if any, attention mechanisms are known to be part of any functioning real-time vision system. The structure of Tsotsos' attention model is determined in part by several constraints derived from a computational complexity analysis of visual search <ref> [40] </ref>. This complexity analysis quantitatively confirms that selective attention is a important contributor in reducing the amount of computation in any vision system. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is loosely modelled after the increasing neurophysiology literature on single-cell recordings from the visual cortex of awake and active primates. <p> Furthermore, the proposed scheme is loosely modelled after the increasing neurophysiology literature on single-cell recordings from the visual cortex of awake and active primates. Moreover, the general architecture of this prototype is consistent with their neuroanatomy <ref> [40, 41] </ref>. 4 At the most basic level, the prototype is comprised of a hierarchical represen-tation of the input stimuli and an attention mechanism that guides selection of portions of the hierarchy from the highest, most abstract level through to the lowest level. <p> A beam is required that "points" to a set of units at the top. That particular beam shines throughout the processing hierarchy with an inhibit zone and a pass zone, 1 see Tsotsos 1990 <ref> [40] </ref> for this derivation 5 Several levels of the processing hierarchy are shown. The pass zone of the beam encompasses all winning inputs at each level of the hierarchy. The dark gray beams represent the actual inhibit zones rooted at each level of the hierarchy.

As a result, Tsotsos' scheme "scales up" extremely well with the size of the problem and in fact scales to human-size problems <ref> [41] </ref>. The simulations presented in this report confirm that this prototype is highly suited for real-world vision problems. Certain aspects of Tsotsos' model are not addressed in this investigation, such as the implementation of task guidance in the attention scheme. <p> Furthermore, the proposed scheme is loosely modelled after the increasing neurophysiology literature on single-cell recordings from the visual cortex of awake and active primates. Moreover, the general architecture of this prototype is consistent with their neuroanatomy <ref> [40, 41] </ref>. 4 At the most basic level, the prototype is comprised of a hierarchical represen-tation of the input stimuli and an attention mechanism that guides selection of portions of the hierarchy from the highest, most abstract level through to the lowest level. <p> At each level of the processing hierarchy, a winner-take-all process (WTA) is used to reduce the competing set and to determine the pass and inhibit zones <ref> [41] </ref>. 1.3 Thesis Outline This study investigates and evaluates Tsotsos' attention scheme. Such an investigation helps accomplish a better understanding of the model and uncovers any shortcomings of the prototype, possibly suggesting modifications. Implementing the model also experimentally establishes many of the parameters of this attention scheme. <p> On sufficiently parallel hardware, this reduces to a constant time. Tsotsos <ref> [41] </ref> has recently developed a more robust WTA update rule that converges even for multiple "winners". Two rules are implemented to influence the shifting of the processing focus. <p> For illustrative purposes, the attention scheme is shown with a one-dimensional representation and illustrated in Figure 3.2 (a) to (e); the extension to two di 1 The WTA updating function and a proof of convergence are described in Tsotsos 1991 <ref> [41] </ref> 25 mensions is straightforward. If a simple stimulus pattern is applied to the input layer, the remaining nodes of the hierarchy will compute their responses based on a weighted summation of their inputs, resulting in the configuration of Figure 3.2 (b). <p> Then, the second brightest item is selected. 30 The second selected item is inhibited and the hierarchy is recomputed again. Then, the final (third) item is selected. 31 3.2 Extensions to the Model Several factors are not considered in Tsotsos' description of the attention model <ref> [41] </ref>. The following discussion explores extensions and enhancements that have been made to the original model. 3.2.1 Receptive Fields The elements that compete in the WTA process are termed "receptive fields" (RF), after the physiological counterpart. <p> Unlike the example of Figure 3.5, there is no centre bias in this instance. The reason the 8 is selected over a 9 is that the 8 is surrounded on each side by elements whose values are 1. Tsotsos notes this phenomenon, referred to as the receptive field profile <ref> [41] </ref>, and suggests that a similar effect may be found in the primate visual cortex. A simple solution is to replace the elements in the hierarchy with the maximum of its inputs rather than the sum. This method is guaranteed to find the overall single-element maximum regardless of its "context".
