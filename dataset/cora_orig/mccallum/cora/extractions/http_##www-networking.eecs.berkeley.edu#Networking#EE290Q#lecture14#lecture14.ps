Reference-contexts: In this lecture we will review three such schemes, examine the performance of one of them, and discuss some outstanding issues. A fluid model, whose desciption was begun in the previous lecture, is used. The majority of today's results are found in <ref> [1] </ref>. 2 Model Consider a bufferless network resource of capacity C. Incoming calls arrive with Poisson distribution at rate -, with lengths exponentially distributed with mean 1. Let X i (t) represent the amount of fluid being emitted by the source of call i at time t. <p> The system is operated at a given value of y, and s (n) is chosen so as to maximize the expression. In this case, y is a Lagrangian parameter controlling the tradeoff, that is, the relative weights of utilization and loss. 4 Performance The authors of <ref> [1] </ref> found promising results for the decision-theoretic approach. When compared with an optimal scheme one which has pefect prior knowledge of p and all results were found 4 to be above 97% of optimal. For a given p, results were better for a small . <p> Another open question is whether using historical state information could improve performance. 6 Conclusions In this lecture we have examined simple threshhold-based call admission schemes as explored in <ref> [1] </ref>. The authors of that paper have shown that a decision-theoretic approach performs nearly as well as an optimal scheme for a simple model. Further, they claim that the scheme responds well to nonstationary sources and performs well with heterogeneous on-off sources.
