Reference-contexts: Therefore, the primary goal of an underlying Networked Multimedia System (NMS) for these applications is to provide Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees in end-to-end fashion <ref> [And93] </ref> (Figure 1). 1 In this paper, our focus is on timing quality guarantees such as end-to-end delay 1 and interme-diate jitter 2 guarantees. Timing quality guarantees imply that continuous and discrete media must be transmitted from sender (s) to receiver (s) within given time-bounds. <p> Page faults seriously affect the real-time performance. 3 5 Distributed Multimedia Protocols In a distributed environment, a setup mechanism that is integrated across all levels of the NMS is necessary to achieve guaranteed services in an end-to-end fashion <ref> [And93] </ref>. The setup mechanism integrates negotiation protocols, admission and translation services (to accommodate heterogeneity in quality representation at individual levels), media encoding of various multimedia devices, and schedulability of timing constraints. These services will be utilized by distributed brokers [NS95a] to make QoS contracts in an end-to-end fashion.

Reference-contexts: Access to these services must be supported with the development of an Application Programming Interface which integrates language constructs for timing constraints and other QoS specifications. 3 Generic protocols provide services for all types of traffic, e.g., best effort, and guaranteed traffic. An example is the XTP protocol <ref> [Che92] </ref>. 4 Special-purpose protocols provide guaranteed services tailored to a specific medium or application. An example is the audio protocol vat [JM92]. 5 Class-oriented protocols provide guaranteed services for a class of applications.

Reference-contexts: For example, the objective of a network provider is to provide maximal throughput, whereas networked audio-visual applications require that guaranteed services have the objective of offering time-bounds on jitter and end-to-end delays <ref> [Fer91] </ref>. This type of conflict needs to be resolved to ensure end-to-end timing guarantees are optimally implemented. 4 Application-Driven Integration At the application level, a variety of distributed multimedia applications employ a wide range of multimedia devices.

Reference-contexts: In general, a multimedia operating system should allow access to pinning mechanisms 6 , fine granularity timers, and various scheduling policies. Customized schedulers with proper admission control should become part of such multimedia operating systems <ref> [Nah95] </ref>. The consistency of scheduling policies for access to shared resources across level boundaries is crucial [NS94]. <p> The envisioned adaptive mechanisms will include update mechanisms for resource allocation in response to detection of system degradation. The challenge is to make monitoring, detection and adaptation mechanisms efficient and fast <ref> [Nah95] </ref>. 6 Conclusion Although there exist many challenges which must be overcome to provide end-to-end QoS guarantees in networked multimedia systems, research on these issues is feasible and exciting due to recent developments in complexity and scheduling theory, as well as in hardware and software for computing and communication of audio-visual

Reference-contexts: Customized schedulers with proper admission control should become part of such multimedia operating systems [Nah95]. The consistency of scheduling policies for access to shared resources across level boundaries is crucial <ref> [NS94] </ref>. This consistency is much harder to achieve than the consistency of scheduling policies within each level of a NMS because the service providers of the individual levels may have different objectives and not share important information.

These services will be utilized by distributed brokers <ref> [NS95a] </ref> to make QoS contracts in an end-to-end fashion. During the transmission phase, consistent scheduling policies along the transmission path, and reliable multicasting protocols at the network level, are required for end-to-end QoS guarantees.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the provision of end-to-end timing guarantees implies that the integration of different services, mechanisms and policies must occur along the transmission path . This integration presents many challenges across all levels of a NMS (i.e., the network, the system, and the application levels) <ref> [NS95b] </ref>.
