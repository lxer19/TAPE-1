Abstract: When a large earthquake shakes California, we will hear it from the news. What we do not hear are thousands smaller earthquakes happening every day around the world. The magnitude of an earthquake is usually measured by the Richter scale. While a more physical quantity is the seismic moment M 0 which is proportional to the energy released in the earthquake. The seismic moments range more than ten orders of magnitude from very small to very large earthquakes. With such a wide range of scales, the frequency-moment distribution has a remarkably simple form the Gutenberg-Richter law: N (M 0 ) M B 0 , where N(M 0 ) is the number of earthquakes with seismic moments larger than M 0 and the exponent B 2=3. This power-law distribution function implies that there is no typical scale for earthquakes. This is an example of the so-called scale-invariant fluctuations. It suggests that the physical mechanism for large earthquakes is the same as that for the small ones. In 1987, Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld [1] proposed the notion of Self-Organized Criticality (SOC) to account for such scale-invariant fluctuations in physical and other systems. The idea is best illustrated by thinking of a model sandpile. Imaging that we build a sandpile from scratch by adding grains of sand slowly and randomly. At the beginning, the pile is rather flat. The added grain usually nestles where it is sprinkled, or it may cause a small local rearrangement of sand grains. As the pile grows we sometimes see larger and larger local rearrangements or avalanches. Eventually the pile will reach a statistically stationary state where its slope has a "critical" value. If the slope of the pile is smaller than the critical value, addition of sand grains will increase the slope. On the other hand, if the slope of the pile is larger than the critical value, addition of sand grains will trigger large avalanches which will
