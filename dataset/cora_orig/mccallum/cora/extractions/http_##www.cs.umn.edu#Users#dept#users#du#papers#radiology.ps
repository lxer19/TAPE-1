Abstract: At the University of Minnesota we are building the infrastructure necessary to realize a distance learning environment that will translate into the provision of a better quality of medical education, at a lower cost, to participants located away from centers of learning. Based on ATM network capabilities, we are focusing on the development, implementation and study of an educational delivery system to provide an environment that will allow access to a media-rich curriculum from anywhere at any time. The first stage of this effort is a trial project for the continuing education of radiology residents located at metropolitan hospitals. In this project, interactive medical lectures including audio, video, and high resolution medical images are delivered to the residents place of work over a metropolitan area ATM network. We describe the goals and implementation of this trial project and describe our experiences and lessons learned from the trial. We go on to identify research issues that we are pursuing in order to provide the educational environment of the future.

Reference-contexts: Distance education was originally available through mail order courses. As technology progressed, mailed paper documents have been augmented first by audio and later by video tapes. In the more recent past, one-way video and two-way audio have been used to further enhance the interactivity of the educational environment <ref> [1] </ref>. Though these methods have their successes, there are also limitations in their use and the effectiveness may not meet that of the classroom experience.

Reference-contexts: This trial application of distance learning is based on ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) technology <ref> [2] </ref>. Three ATM switch vendors, Fujitsu, AT&T, and Siemens Stromberg-Carlson, are participating in the trial environment. After eight months of preparation, including defining the requirements and designing and building the network, the Department of Radiology began using the testbed for the delivery of lectures.

Reference-contexts: Seven major digital imaging modalities are: digitized plain film (X-rays), computed radiography (CR), storage plates, e.g., storage phosphor integrated with a laser for digital readout, computed tomography (CT), nuclear medicine (NM), ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital fluoroscopy (DF) <ref> [3] </ref>. These images range in size from tens of kilobytes to tens of megabytes for each image.

Reference-contexts: If the image quality of the original film is to be preserved, then the inherent quality of the imaging system, in terms of all of its components as well as the characteristics of the film itself, must be considered <ref> [7] </ref>. Typical chest and abdominal images of an adult are capable of maintaining a resolution of 5-7 line pairs per millimeter which translates to a 101 - 72 micron spot size for digitization of a standard 36cm x 43cm (14" x 17") film.

An environment for distance learning must provide the capability for the instructor to convey information to the students and for the students to actively participate in this process through a dialogue. This communication may be either synchronous (same time) or asynchronous (different times).
