Title: Algorithms for Computing and Integrating Physical Maps Using Unique Probes  
Author: Mudita Jain Eugene W. Myers 
Date: April 3, 1997  
Abstract: Current physical mapping projects based on STS-probes involve additional clues such as the fact that some probes are anchored to a known map and that others come from the ends of clones. Because of the disparate combinatorial contributions of these varied data items, it is difficult to design a "tailored" algorithm that incorporates them all. Moreover, it is inevitable that new experiments will provide new kinds of data, making obsolete any such algorithm. We show how to convert the physical mapping problem into a 0/1 linear programming (LP) problem. We further show how one can incorporate additional clues as additional constraints in the LP formulation. We give a simple relaxation of the 0/1 LP problem that solves problems of the same scale as previously reported tailored algorithms to equal or greater optimization levels. We also present a theorem proving that when the data is 100% accurate, then the relaxed and integer solutions coincide. The LP algorithm suffices to solve problems on the order of 80-100 probes | the typical size of the 2- or 3-connected contigs of Arratia et al. We give a heuristic algorithm which attempts to order and link the set of LP-solved contigs. Unlike previous work, this algorithm only links and orders contigs when the join is 90% or more likely to be correct. It is our view that there is no value in computing an optimal solution with respect to some criteria over very noisy data as this optimal solution rarely corresponds to the true solution. The paper involves extensive empirical trials over real and simulated data.

Reference-contexts: Partially supported by NLM grant LM-04960 1 estimated that false negatives occur at fixed rate * (typically 10-20%), false positives at rate ffi (typically 5-10%), and chimeras at rate (typically 1-5%). Alizadeh et al. <ref> [AKWZ95] </ref> showed that minimizing the objective function: C fc (D ) + P fp (D ) + N fn (D ) (1) maximizes the likelihood, Pr (T jD ), of T given D , where fc (D ) is the number of chimera corrections, fp (D ) is the number of <p> There can be errors in these maps. If anchored probes are mislocated at rate ff (typically 1%), then an easy extension of the analysis of <ref> [AKWZ95] </ref> reveals that it suffices to add the term M fa () to the objective (1) above, where fa () is the number of mislocated anchored probes with respect to , and the constant M is the log-likelihood ratio: M = ln ff 1ff . <p> We then proceed to translocate and/or invert blocks to other break point sites, accepting such a move if it reduces the cost of the objective function. This algorithm is essentially the 2-OPT local search algorithm used by Alizadeh et al. <ref> [AKWZ95] </ref>, except that our moves are non-random. In all of our trials, this swapping algorithm converged to a near-optimal solution after 5 to 10 moves. <p> But our LP-based algorithm for physical mapping is only viable for problems up to 100 probes. This is also the size range of the largest linear ordering problems (recall the similarity) solved by cutting plane methods and the size of problems reported in the work of Alizadeh et al. <ref> [AKWZ95] </ref>. 14 We therefore need to decompose a large problem into smaller, relatively independent subsets or clusters that can be ordered separately without significant loss of accuracy.

Reference-contexts: In the second part, we then give a heuristic algorithm that specifically takes advantage of these additional data items to create the best possible global ordering of the 2- or 3-connected contigs of Arratia et al. <ref> [ALTW91] </ref>. 2 An Integer Linear Programming Model Consider first the problem where one is given the m fi n hybridization matrix D = [d pc ] and the only phenomenon to be modeled are false positives and negatives. Two sets of 0/1 variables are required for the LP formulation.

Reference-contexts: The problem is to find an ordering of the probes such that the probes incident to each clone are consecutive in the order. Formally, one seeks a permutation of the probes/rows that gives the permuted matrix D the consecutive ones property <ref> [BL76] </ref>. If the information in D is perfect than the problem is solvable in linear time [BL76]. <p> Formally, one seeks a permutation of the probes/rows that gives the permuted matrix D the consecutive ones property <ref> [BL76] </ref>. If the information in D is perfect than the problem is solvable in linear time [BL76]. However, in practice, the measured data contains errors in the form of false positives (i.e. a 1 where there should be a 0), false negatives (i.e. a 0 where there should be a 1), and chimeras (i.e. two distinct intervals reported as one).

Reference-contexts: Both these costs are computed 16 incrementally, using extensions to the recurrences of <ref> [JM95] </ref> for handling end-probe and anchor information, as described in a bit later in this section. The algorithm explores the space of permutations by adding probes to the right-end of an initial prefix, i , of length i of a permutation. <p> To efficiently compute a lower bound in O (n + lgm) time, we consider the best extension in which the values in each column may be permuted independently of each other. These can easily be scored using the recurrences presented in <ref> [JM95] </ref> extended to accommodate the longest increasing sequence computation required for scoring anchors. Note that this B&B subprocedure is not a heuristic. It solves mapping problems with up to 60 clones optimally in less than an hour of compute time. <p> The overall minimum cost correction to the column is then min c (V m ; R c ) + (c 1)C. As in our paper <ref> [JM95] </ref>, we developed a set of intertwining dynamic programming recurrences which compute (V i ; Q) for all i and Q for each of the patterns 0 ? , 0 ? e (1 ? 0 ? ) c1 1 ? , 0 ? e (1 ? 0 ? ) c ,

In the case that these values are fractional, we appeal to the objective of the linear-ordering problem <ref> [Rei85] </ref>, to design a greedy heuristic that seeks a permutation of the probes maximizing P (j)&lt;(k) x (j)(k) . We build the order from left to right, picking the next probe in the ordering at each step.
