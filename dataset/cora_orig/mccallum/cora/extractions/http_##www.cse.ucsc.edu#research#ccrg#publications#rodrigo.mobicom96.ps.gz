Abstract: Collision avoidance and resolution multiple access (CARMA) protocols are presented and analyzed. These protocols use a floor acquisition multiple access strategy based on carrier sensing, together with collision resolution of floor requests (RTS) based on a tree-splitting algorithm. For analytical purposes, an upper bound is derived for the average costs of resolving collisions of floor requests using the tree-splitting algorithm. This bound is then applied to the computation of the average channel utilization in a fully connected network with a large number of stations. Under light-load conditions, CARMA protocols achieve the same average throughput as floor acquisition multiple access (FAMA) protocols. It is also shown that, as the arrival rate of RTSs increases, the throughput achieved by CARMA protocols is close to the maximum throughput that any FAMA protocol can achieve if propagation delays and the control packets used to acquire the floor are much smaller than the data packet trains sent by stations. Simulation results validate the simplifying approximations made in the analytical model. Our analysis results indicate that collision resolution makes floor acquisition multiple access much more effective.
