Title: A Model of the Human Capacity for Categorizing Spatial Relations  
Author: Terry Regier 
Address: Berkeley  
Affiliation: University of California at  
Note: Submitted to Cognitive Linguistics.  
Abstract: Languages vary dramatically in their structuring of space. Despite this wide variation, however, the search for universals in spatial semantics is well motivated by the fact that all linguistic spatial systems are based on human experience of space, which is in turn constrained by the nature of the human perceptual system. I present a connectionist model which contributes to the search for universals in this domain. Its design incorporates a number of structural devices motivated by neurobiological and psychophysical evidence concerning the human visual system; these provide a universal perceptual core which constrains the process of semantic acquisition. Using these structures, the model learns the perceptually grounded semantics for closed-class spatial terms from a range of languages | providing at least a preliminary model of the human capacity for categorizing spatial events and relations. The model gives rise to two predictions concerning the manner in which one can expect to find motion encoded in closed-class spatial terms in the world's languages.

Reference-contexts: In addition, while physical space is objectively measurable, human conceptualizations of space as manifested in language afford a good deal of subtlety in their semantic structure. In this respect space resembles the domain of color, another objectively measurable yet conceptually rich semantic domain <ref> (Berlin & Kay 1969) </ref>. Space is also attractive as a domain of semantic inquiry because there is considerable cross-linguistic variation in spatial systems. The notion of cross-linguistic variation in conceptual systems and modes of thought has long been a subject of fascination for linguists.

These feature maps are used in the detection of non-orientational spatial features such as contact and inclusion.

Reference-contexts: in Figures Figure 3 and Figure 4, the model learns a system of spatial terms in consort, so that a positive example of one spatial term can serve as weak implicit negative evidence for all others. 6 Results The model was trained using back-propagation (Rumelhart et al. 1986) and quickprop <ref> (Fahlman 1988) </ref>, a variant thereof. It has been tested on spatial terms from English, German, Bengali, Russian, and Mixtec. I present results from English, Russian, and Mixtec, to demonstrate that the model is capable of learning spatial terms from languages with widely varying spatial systems.

Reference-contexts: Thus, this can be viewed as a beginning-path-end representation, as it implicitly decomposes a trajectory into a beginning, an end, and the path from one to the other. Psychophysical motivation for this structure comes from the visual phenomenon of apparent motion <ref> (Kolers 1972) </ref>. Human subjects, when presented with an object displayed briefly at one position in the visual field, and then with another copy of the object displayed at another position, often perceive the object moving smoothly from the first point to the second.

Reference-contexts: This point is strengthened by the fact that space often serves as a source domain for metaphoric understandings of other parts of the conceptual system; its influence is therefore not localized to an isolated sphere of experience <ref> (Lakoff 1987) </ref>. In addition, while physical space is objectively measurable, human conceptualizations of space as manifested in language afford a good deal of subtlety in their semantic structure. In this respect space resembles the domain of color, another objectively measurable yet conceptually rich semantic domain (Berlin & Kay 1969).

Reference-contexts: The movie shown in Figure 2 was one of many used in training the system described here. Each movie contains a static object here referred to as the landmark, or LM <ref> (Langacker 1987) </ref>; this is the reference object with respect to which other objects are located. In this movie, it is the horizontally extended rectangle in the middle of the scene.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a positive example of in is taken as an implicit negative example of above, below, outside, through, etc. This is essentially the same as the "principle of mutual exclusivity", posited for the process of learning to name objects <ref> (Markman 1987) </ref>. Related ideas can also be found in the language learning literature (Johnston & Slobin 1979; Clark 1987; Pinker 1989; MacWhinney 1989; Sinha et al. 1993). There is a serious problem with this useful heuristic, however: it can easily give rise to false implicit negative evidence.

Reference-contexts: In the terms we are using here, given the beginning point and then the end point, the subjects perceptually infer the path. Thus, beginning point and end point serve as anchor-points of sorts, from which the path is computed. Recent connectionist research in modeling apparent motion <ref> (Olson 1989) </ref> has focused on the computation of explicit trajectories given beginning and end points.

Reference-contexts: These feature maps are used in the detection of non-orientational spatial features such as contact and inclusion. The interested reader may find further details regarding these structures in <ref> (Regier 1992) </ref>. 5.1 Motion Buffers: Tripartite Trajectory Representation While the evidence for orientation sensitive cells, topographic maps, and cells with circularly symmetric center-surround receptive fields comes from neurobiology, the motion buffers are motivated by psychophysical and linguistic evidence. <p> These predicted disadvantages are borne out by empirical testing, which has shown that the motion buffer approach outperforms simple recurrent networks when applied to the task of learning closed-class categorizations of spatial relations <ref> (Regier 1992) </ref>. <p> This problem of false implicit negatives then is the central flaw in mutual exclusivity. Mutual exclusivity can be salvaged however, by treating positive and negative instances differently during training. In particular, implicit negatives are viewed as supplying only weak negative evidence, while explicit positives supply strong positive evidence <ref> (Regier 1992) </ref>. This is the method adopted here in modeling the acquisition of spatial semantics.

Reference-contexts: As shown in the figure, the model is configured to learn a set of English spatial terms. The model is trained using the connectionist error back-propagation algorithm <ref> (Rumelhart et al. 1986) </ref>, while its architecture is informed by the design philosophy of adaptive structured connectionism (Regier & Feldman 1994). The fundamental idea behind this philosophy is the combination of elaborate motivated structure with the more traditional connectionist feature of adaptability to training data. <p> As we saw in Figures Figure 3 and Figure 4, the model learns a system of spatial terms in consort, so that a positive example of one spatial term can serve as weak implicit negative evidence for all others. 6 Results The model was trained using back-propagation <ref> (Rumelhart et al. 1986) </ref> and quickprop (Fahlman 1988), a variant thereof.

Reference-contexts: If the supporting surface is roughly horizontal, as in the scene on the left in Figure 1 (b), the preposition auf is used to describe the relation.
