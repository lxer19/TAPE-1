Reference-contexts: We can distinguish between the protocols and services quite strictly. The Internet community is extending its protocols to add stronger guarantees of service, but it is doing so in quite a subtle fashion: by adding an optional resource reservation protocol, RSVP <ref> [rsvp] </ref>, it is possible for applications that need guarantees to make statements of those needs to the network. However, those that do not need guarantees see no change in protocol.

Reference-contexts: Thus, for example, the IETF have advanced further in aiding implementation, by proposing specific admission tests for given schedules. (See for example <ref> [admit] </ref>). In fact, they go further and state that Weighted Fair Queuing with Priorities is a scheme that is sufficient enough to support all the range of classes in the hierarchy above if applied correctly. A highly flexible framework for implementing this was presented in [cbq].

Reference-contexts: This makes it a mater of some importance that we have a common understanding of integrated service networks, of whatever kind they may be. 3 Rationale The Integrated Services Working Group of the IETF has been working towards a service model for the future Internet <ref> [intserv] </ref>. Meanwhile, various standards groups have been working towards a service model for traffic management in ATM networks. The ITU and ATM Forum are both active here. [uni][uni4][garrett].

Reference-contexts: On a larger scale, one could imagine managing distributed information services in an integrated way if there is a way of mapping the application priorities into lower layer QoS or flow specifications. For example, all the traffic for given media types from world wide web servers <ref> [www] </ref> might have the same QoS parameters, but if some of it was emergency service related (e.g. earthquake warnings, air traffic control information etc.) it should be subject to different rules for replacements than regular traffic, as it traverses some future multi-provider network. 9 Ordering and Routing Dynamic routing is often

Reference-contexts: The IETF see the network as consisting of many routers, which in practice might each be subjected to a Bradner (ng) test <ref> [bradner] </ref>, to see the effect on timing reconstruction (or burst to jitter conversion) of various traffic mixes.

Reference-contexts: In fact, they go further and state that Weighted Fair Queuing with Priorities is a scheme that is sufficient enough to support all the range of classes in the hierarchy above if applied correctly. A highly flexible framework for implementing this was presented in <ref> [cbq] </ref>. An historical perspective of the difference in approach is that the Internet has typically been paid for by subscription or leasefees based on access speed, while the public data networks have been paid for on a usage basis.
