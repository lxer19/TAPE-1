Title: Case Retrieval Nets: Basic Ideas and Extensions  
Author: Hans-Dieter Burkhard and Mario Lenz 
Address: Berlin  
Affiliation: Dept. of Computer Science, Humboldt University  
Abstract: An efficient retrieval of a relatively small number of relevant cases from a huge case base is a crucial subtask of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). In this article, we present Case Retrieval Nets, a memory model that has recently been developed for this task. The main idea is to apply a spreading activation process to the case memory structured as a Case Retrieval Net in order to retrieve cases being sufficiently similar to a posed query case. This article summarizes the basic ideas of Case Retrieval Nets and suggests some useful extensions.

Reference-contexts: Before we go into the details about CRNs, we would like to outline what we consider as requirements for a case retrieval technique. Basically, there are three major conditions to be met: efficiency, completeness, and flexibility (cf. also [12, pp.193] and <ref> [1, p.5] </ref>): Efficiency concerns the effort required to access relevant cases. Access of these cases should avoid exhaustive search in memory.

Reference-contexts: Such similarities can be easily implemented by special BCRNs (cf. Section 4 and <ref> [2, 7] </ref>). As experiments show (cf. [5]), the implementation of case retrieval using CRNs is efficient. <p> Thus the propagation of activation to less similar IEs may be aborted if sufficiently similar cases have been accessed. Lazy Spreading Activation may be used e.g. for numerical attributes, where similarity is computed as some inverse of the difference (cf. <ref> [2, 7] </ref> for handling of such attributes in BCRN). The technique might fail w.r.t. completeness since the activities collected by the case nodes c may be incomplete for some IE nodes which are not in the scope of propagation.

Reference-contexts: This research has led to a number of sophisticated techniques for this subtask, as for example indexing techniques ([8]); kd-trees ([12, 13]); the heuristic Fish-and-Sink approach ([9]); the Crash memory model ([1]); and Knowledge-directed Spreading Activation (KDSA, <ref> [14] </ref>). In an earlier paper ([6]), we presented ABS, a summary of our initial ideas of how to structure the case memory in order to support efficient case retrieval.
