Abstract: We report our project aimed at the design and implementation of a mid-ware tool kit, called NetEx, that provides deadline-guaranteed and connection-oriented communication services at the application layer. NetEx comprises of a Host Traffic Manager (HTM) and a Network Traffic Manager (NTM). An HTM resides in each participating host while the NTM can be implemented either at a central host or in a distributed manner. The HTM performs traffic scheduling and enforces traffic regulation at individual hosts. The NTM is the decision maker on connection admission control. We argue that portability and efficiency are two fundamental issues one has to address in the design of such a middle-ware tool kit. We present strategies adopted by NetEx in order to support portability and efficiency. We report system performance based on several benchmarks.

Reference-contexts: i,j (I) = (I+d i,j ) G i,j (I +d i,j )/I (8) That is, we can express the output traffic, G i,j (I), in terms of the input traffic, G i,j (I) and the delay, d i,j . (8) follows directly from the delay property of maximum rate function <ref> [1] </ref>. Using (8), subsequent servers can be analyzed. Once all the delays at individual servers are obtained, we can substitute (7) into (1) to compute the delay for connection j.

Reference-contexts: To exploit this advantage, the delay analysis routine in NetEx is initialized by a configuration file that specifies the decomposed network (i.e., the basic servers and their linkage). Any change of the network only necessitates a revision of this configuration file. For the details of this specification file, see <ref> [19] </ref>. 2.3.3 Traffic Description These values are indeed offered by device manufacturer as part of device specifications. The overall efficiency of the system depends heavily on the tightness of the worst case delays that are derived by the delay analysis routine.

Reference-contexts: Approximation methods have been proposed to avoid these shortcomings <ref> [21] </ref>. In particular, the point approximation method is used to construct an approximate G (I) when traffic information at limited number of points are given. Our experiments have shown that a six-point approximation can characterize real traffic with good precision [32].

Reference-contexts: Due to the space limitation, in the rest of this paper, we will concentrate on the Run-Time Traffic Control Module because it performs critical operations of host traffic management. A discussion of other modules can be found in <ref> [23] </ref>. 3.2 RunTime Traffic Control Module 3.2.1 Traffic Control and NetEx Approaches Host traffic management is necessary for two reasons: 1) Packet transmission delay in the host has to be controlled.

Reference-contexts: The data furnished here are based on two popular benchmarks which have been widely used in studies of this nature. The data sets are MPEG-1 encoded VBR video traces. The first benchmark is from the movie Star Wars <ref> [24] </ref> and the second is from a video conferencing trace [25]. The user application presents one MPEG frame every 40ms in each connection. The host load is measured by the number of such connections supported.

Reference-contexts: A traffic description based on peak rate, on the other hand, can frequently lead to overestimating worst-case delay. While reasonably accurate in processor scheduling <ref> [26] </ref>, the periodic (C, P) model (where C packets are transmitted periodically every P seconds) cannot correctly reflect the traffic status in the network, often resulting in loose delay bounds [32]. To solve this problem, several research groups have conducted comprehensive theoretical and experimental investigation [3,11,14,32].

Reference-contexts: We describe these three in the subsequent subsections. 2.3.2 Network Decomposition We will illustrate network decomposition with the aid of an example. A network with an ATM backbone interconnecting hosts on FDDI rings is shown in Figure 3 <ref> [30] </ref>. Network decomposition makes it simple to analyze delays in a structure that appears formidable for delay analysis. This EPS image does not contain a screen preview. It will print correctly to a PostScript printer.
