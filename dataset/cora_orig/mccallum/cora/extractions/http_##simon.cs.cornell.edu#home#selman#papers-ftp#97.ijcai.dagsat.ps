Abstract: Stochastic search has recently been shown to be successful for solving large boolean satisfiability problems. However, systematic methods tend to be more effective in problem domains with a large number of dependent variables: that is, variables whose truth values are directly determined by a smaller set of independent variables. In systematic search, truth values can be efficiently propagated from the independent to the dependent variables by unit propagation. Such propagation is more expensive in traditional stochastic procedures. In this paper we propose a mechanism for effectively dealing with dependent variables in stochastic search. We also provide empirical data showing the procedure outperforms the best previous stochastic and systematic search procedures on large formulas with a high ratio of dependent to independent variables.

Reference-contexts: Now SAT algorithms are being applied to such problems as constraint-based planning (Blum and Furst 1995; Kautz and Selman 1996), problems in finite algebra (Fujita et al. 1993), verification of hardware and software, scheduling <ref> (Crawford and Baker 1994) </ref>, circuit synthesis and diagnosis (Larrabee 1992), and many other domains, including natural language processing and machine learning. In fact, one can argue that the value of research on propositional reasoning ultimately depends on our ability to find suitable SAT encodings of real-world problems.

Reference-contexts: Further improvements can be made through the use of even more sophisticated heuristics based on detecting and propagating definitions (Silva 1995). By contrast, it appears to be more difficult to establish that identification of defined variables improves stochastic search. Local search procedures for satisfiability <ref> (Sel-man et al. 1992, Gu 1992) </ref> take longer to propagate dependencies. A rough rule of thumb is that about O (n 2 ) steps are required for the values of the dependent variables to become aligned with independent variables.

Reference-contexts: The number of violated clauses is used as the cost (or energy) function guiding the stochastic search. The Walksat architecture seems to be uniformly superior to the earlier GSAT architecture which used the same cost function but flipped variables not occuring in violated clauses <ref> (Selman et al. 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Branching on defined variables can be avoided by using a variable-ordering heuristic that places the independent variables ahead of the dependent ones. Further improvements can be made through the use of even more sophisticated heuristics based on detecting and propagating definitions <ref> (Silva 1995) </ref>. By contrast, it appears to be more difficult to establish that identification of defined variables improves stochastic search. Local search procedures for satisfiability (Sel-man et al. 1992, Gu 1992) take longer to propagate dependencies.
