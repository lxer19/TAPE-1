Abstract: In nature the genotype of many organisms exhibits diploidy, i.e., it includes two copies of every gene. In this paper we describe the results of simulations comparing the behavior of haploid and diploid populations of ecological neural networks living in both fixed and changing environments. We show that diploid genotypes create more variability in fitness in the population than haploid genotypes and buffer better environmental change; as a consequence, if one wants to obtain good results for both average and peak fitness in a single population one should choose a diploid population with an appropriate mutation rate. Some results of our simulations parallel biological findings.

Reference-contexts: In most work applying genetic algorithms to populations of neural networks the genotype directly encodes the phenotypical properties of the networks, e.g., the network's connection weights, so that the genotype-to-phenotype mapping is one-to-one. More complex mappings from the genotype to the phenotypical network have been proposed (cf., e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>) but the variety of genotype-to-phenotype mappings that are found in real organisms is still largely to be explored and analyzed with simulations. In real organisms genotypes can be either haploid or diploid. A haploid genotype contains a single set of instructions for constructing the phenotype.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we report some work that compares the performance of haploid and diploid genotypes in populations of ecological neural networks, i.e., networks controlling the behavior of organisms living in a (simulated) physical environment <ref> [2] </ref>. We describe the results of simulations comparing the behavior of haploid and diploid populations in both fixed and changing environments. 2. Simulations The organism is a simulated mobile robot called Khepera [3,4].

Reference-contexts: Two output units encode the speed of the robot's two wheels and 2 bias units are connected to these output units. A genetic algorithm <ref> [5] </ref> was used to evolve the connection weights of a population of such organisms. An initial population of 100 neural networks was generated by assigning random weights to the 22 connections of each network.

Reference-contexts: The remaining 2 bits coded for the dominance/recessivity mechanism (dominance modifier genes; see fig. 1). Notice that in nature dominance can vary in degree, sometimes because of intervening modifiers genes that enhance (or decrease) the expression of another gene (or group of genes) involved in a trait's expression <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In their theoretical and experimental analysis of diploidy and dominance applied to a 0-1 knapsack problem, Goldberg and Smith <ref> [7] </ref> have shown that diploid genotypes perform in a temporally varying environment better than haploid ones because "diploidy embodies a form of temporal memory that is distributed across population".

Reference-contexts: Various studies have focused on the use of diploid genotypes and dominance operators in artificial genetic search (e.g., <ref> [8] </ref> and [9]) but, to our knowledge, the present work is the first one comparing haploid and diploid genotypes for the optimization of neural networks.

Reference-contexts: As a consequence, it is less obvious that different alleles may encode solutions suited for different environments. From a biological point of view, the experimental results of Paquin and Adams <ref> [10] </ref> on yeast populations are those more usefully comparable with our simulation results. In some simulations not reported here in which the environment shifts from A to B and back every other generation, diploid populations with 1% mutation rate show very little fluctuation in fitness value compared with haploids [11]. <p> In fact, they seem to have found a good solution for both environments. This last result supports the conclusions of Paquin and Adams <ref> [10] </ref> on the role of diploidy in short-term adaptation to new environments in asexual organisms. More generally, we think that a deeper theoretical analysis of our approach can provide useful insights on the significance and evolution of diploidy (cf. [11]).
