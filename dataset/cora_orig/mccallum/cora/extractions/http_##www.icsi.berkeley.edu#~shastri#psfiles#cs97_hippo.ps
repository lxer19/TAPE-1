Title: A Model of Rapid Memory Formation in the Hippocampal System

Abstract: Our ability to remember events and situations in our daily life demonstrates our ability to rapidly acquire new memories. There is a broad consensus that the hippocampal system (HS) plays a critical role in the formation and retrieval of such memories. A computational model is described that demonstrates how the HS may rapidly transform a transient pattern of activity representing an event or a situation into a persistent structural encoding via long-term potentiation and long-term depression.

Reference-contexts: When this happens, we say that the cell has become committed. The process of commitment can also be viewed as a neurally plausible realization of the notion of long-term recruitment <ref> (Feldman, 1982) </ref>. to the functional circuit A&B 1 . We assume that initially C is uncommitted and its synapses have low efficacy.

Reference-contexts: These inputs are believed to play an important regulatory role and may provide a global control signal that enables or disables learning <ref> (Hasselmo, 1997) </ref>. LTP and the Emergence of Committed Cells Long-term potentiation (LTP) involves long-term increase in synaptic strength resulting from the pairing of presynaptic activity with postsynaptic depolarization, and has emerged as the most promising cellular mechanism underlying activity dependent memory formation (Lynch & Granger, 1992).

LTP involves the unusual receptor NMDA which is activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate, but only if the post-synaptic membrane is already depolarized.

Reference-contexts: Several studies have shown that human patients with bilateral damage to the HS suffer from severe amnesia and are unable to remember events that occurred just a few minutes ago <ref> (e.g., Scoville & Milner, 1957) </ref>. Such patients, however, can still acquire procedural skills and demonstrate priming effects. Studies of animal models (e.g., O'Keefe & Nadel, 1978; Squire & Zola-Morgan, 1991) also provide support for the putative role of the HS.

Reference-contexts: Existing HS based memory models as well as purely computational models of rapid memorization proposed by Feldman (1982) and Valiant (1994) do not satisfy these representational requirements. A Model of Memory Formation in the HS The proposed model SMRITI 1 <ref> (Shastri, 1997) </ref> addresses the representational requirements discussed above and demonstrates how a system like the HS might rapidly transform a transient pattern of activity representing an event or a situation into a persistent encoding capable of supporting recognition and recall.
