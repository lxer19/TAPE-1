Title: A Parallel Numerical Model for Subsurface Contaminant Transport With Biodegradation Kinetics  
Author: Todd Arbogast and Mary F. Wheeler 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the formulation of a simulator for groundwater flow and transport with biodegradation kinetics that has been developed at Rice University for massively parallel, distributed memory, message passing machines. The numerical procedures employed are a mixed finite element method for flow and the characteristics-mixed method for transport. Kinetics are treated by time splitting. The linear solvers are based on domain decomposition. Application of this procedure to a bioremediation problem as well as numerical experiments on the INTEL i860 and INTEL Delta are discussed. Results indicate that the procedure is theoretically mass conservative over each grid cell and is approximately so in implementation. Preliminary tests indicate that the procedure is robust and applicable to realistic groundwater problems. Moreover, the numerical model scales almost linearly with the number of processors even for fairly coarse grids.

(This more general form of the mixed method is analyzed in greater detail in <ref> [2] </ref>.) It is well known that in a single time-step of the mixed method, C n is convergent to c n only to the first order in h, and that we can improve this order through various post-processing techniques.

Reference-contexts: For simplicity, we assume linear sorption and aerobic conditions. More general kinetics such as Michaelis-Menton can be treated with the numerical techniques described in this paper. In x3, we first describe the mixed finite element method for an elliptic flow equation [8,26]. We then formulate the characteristics-mixed method <ref> [3] </ref>. Theoretical convergence estimates are stated for the characteristics-mixed method. Finally, we briefly discuss the time-splitting scheme employed for treating advection-diffusion-reaction problems. In x4 we describe the parallel implementation of the procedure, and in x5 we present three dimensional, parallel, bioremediation simulation results. <p> Although this method allows one to use large time-step increments and to treat large Peclet numbers, the main drawback of the method is its nonconservative nature and the cost of tracing the characteristics from many points. The characteristics-mixed method introduced by the authors <ref> [3] </ref> retains all the advantages of MMOC-Galerkin in addition to being theoretically conservative. As in MMOC-Galerkin, a directional derivative is used to treat the hyperbolic part of (6a), but then a mixed finite element method is applied to treat the diffusion/dispersion. <p> Note that w = 1 gives material balance; in fact, mass is conserved cell by cell over the grid. The following convergence is attained by the scheme under reasonable hypotheses (see <ref> [3] </ref> for the proof).

Reference-contexts: There have been several interface problem solution techniques proposed [10,11]; however, the one used for the calculations reported in x5 is Balancing. This procedure was defined and analyzed by Cowsar, Mandel, and one of the authors <ref> [10] </ref> and implemented by Cowsar. There are three components to multi-domain balancing. The first involves the solution of the subdomain problems with Dirichlet data provided on internal interfaces. The second involves the solution of subdomain problems with Neumann data.
