Title: An Efficient Message Authentication Scheme for Link State Routing  
Author: Steven Cheung 
Address: Davis, CA 95616  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of California  
Abstract: We study methods for reducing the cost of secure link state routing. In secure link state routing, routers may need to verify the authenticity of many routing updates, and some routers such as border routers may need to sign many routing updates. Previous work such as public-key based schemes either is very expensive computationally or has certain limitations. This paper presents an efficient solution, based on a detection-diagnosis-recovery approach, for the link state routing update authentication problem. Our scheme is scalable to handle large networks, applicable to routing protocols that use multiple-valued cost metrics, and applicable even when link states change frequently.

Reference-contexts: We use a detection-diagnosis-recovery approach, which is intrusion detection (e.g., [2, 10, 13, 5]) augmented with system diagnosis and reconfiguration, inspired by work in fault tolerance. This approach is also used in Cheung's and Levitt's <ref> [1] </ref> paper on protecting routing infrastructures from routers that incorrectly drop packets and misroute packets. Our main goal is to minimize the cost of performing link state update authentication when the network components function normally, which occurs most of the time.

The need for multiple-valued link states arises when link costs depend on traffic load, and when a border router advertises (summarized) link costs for destinations that reside in other autonomous systems or in other areas within the same autonomous system.
