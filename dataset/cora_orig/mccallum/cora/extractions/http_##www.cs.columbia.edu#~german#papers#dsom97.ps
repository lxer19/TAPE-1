Title: Load Distribution for Scalable Web Servers: Summer Olympics 1996 A Case Study

Abstract: The 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games were the first to have an official Web site. This site had more than 60 Web server hosts, spread across 5 locations in 4 countries, and registered over 192 million hits during the 17 days of the games. This paper describes some of the challenges of building, operating and managing such a large distributed system. In particular, it outlines the use of novel TCP/IP technologies for sharing the load of HTTP requests across local and global servers. Using these technologies enabled us to build a scalable distributed Web server site that was able to comfortably support a huge demand. We also describe some of the management tools used for monitoring the system, logging HTTP requests, and providing secure access to system resources.

Reference-contexts: During the Olympic games, it reacted effectively to the bursty nature of the requests traffic, discovered and routed around server failures, and was very efficient in balancing the load among all the active servers. The two main strategies for improving performance using load distribution are load-balancing and load-sharing <ref> [1] </ref>. Load-balancing strives to equalize the workload among servers. Load-sharing attempts to smooth out transient peak overload periods on some nodes [3]. Load-balancing strategies typically require many more resources and are better suited for large batch jobs.

Reference-contexts: If the active WOMsprayer host failed, the filtering router ARP table would be updated so that new requests will arrive to the secondary WOMsprayer.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the service for this client has effectively been "moved" to the preferred site. 4 Local Load Sharing The purpose of load-sharing is to reduce the average response time by smoothing out transient peak overload on some of the nodes of a distributed system <ref> [4] </ref>. The WOMsprayer is a software TCP connection router, that serves as a load-sharing front-end to a collection of back-end servers. The WOMsprayer host offers a collection of Virtual IP Addresses (VIPA) to the outside world.

Reference-contexts: The WOMplex also delivered live audio from a local Atlanta radio station, and low bit-rate video and audio clips. Before the games, some people wondered whether the Internet would "survive" the Olympics [6].
