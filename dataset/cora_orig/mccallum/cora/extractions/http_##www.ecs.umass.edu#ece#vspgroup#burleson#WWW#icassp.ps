Abstract: We describe a 95 GHz radar for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The radar measures vertical profiles of the reflectivity and doppler velocity of clouds, which are then telemetered to the ground for storage. Telemetry bandwidth requires that substantial real-time data processing be done on the UAV in a low-power (less than 100 watts) and small size (less than 1 cubic foot) system. A prototype was developed in less than a year, thus a flexible programmable technology was required. Although typical remote sensing radars use DSP chips, it was determined that our power, size, performance and design-time requirements were best met using FPGA technology. Our system is based on the Giga-Ops Spectrum system which uses Xilinx FPGAs on a novel modular PCI board. Unlike numerous recent FPGA-based signal processors, this presents a new class of applications and embedded system requirements. Reconfigurable capabilities are currently being explored to support radar algorithms which can adapt to a changing environment.

Reference-contexts: The AD4092 is currently one of the lowest power 12-bit A/Ds at this speed. The output of the A/D is sent to the FPGA-based system. To comply with the constraints on power and size placed on the project, the Giga Ops Spectrum System <ref> [3] </ref> was investigated. The Spectrum System is a reconfigurable computing platform consisting of both hardware and software for use on a PCI-based Personal Computer. <p> In addition, as with DSPs, both the vendors and third party companies supply support hardware and software. The GigaOps Spectrum system attempts to make the design process using FPGAs as easy and transparent as possible. Using XLINK-OS <ref> [3] </ref>, there is a specific design procedure to take a design in many forms (Schematic, VHDL, Ver-ilog, etc.) and implement it on the Spectrum platform. Spectrum also provides a convenient interface to allow straightforward PCI communication with the FPGA co-processor from a C-program running on the host.

Reference-contexts: FPGA VS. DSP A traditional data acquisition system for a remote sensing radar consists of dedicated, floating point DSP processors working alone or in parallel <ref> [4] </ref>. DSPs are instruction-set processors that are specifically engineered for signal processing algorithms. Some DSP features include separate program and data busses, one-cycle multiply-accumulate commands, and program controlled memory systems. DSPs are generally considered to be complex instruction set computers that are specialized for digital filters and transforms.

Reference-contexts: One of the floating point DSP chips considered for this project was the Analog Devices SuperHarvard Architecture (SHARC) processor. It was estimated that the pulse pair algorithm, running at the desired speed, would require at least four SHARCs. Each SHARC processor is rated at 4 watts <ref> [5] </ref> running at constant speed, and thus this solution would consume 16 watts in just the DSP chips alone. Another commonly used DSP chip is the TMS320C40 from Texas Instruments [6]. As with the SHARC from Analog Devices, the pulse pair algorithm would require four C40s operating in parallel.

Reference-contexts: Because of these attractive features, the FPGA market is probably one of the most rapidly growing areas in the semiconductor industry. Prominent FPGA vendors include Xilinx, Altera, Actel and Atmel <ref> [7] </ref>. Like DSPs, FPGAs are purchased as commodity parts and then programmed by developers for different applications. This means the design costs and risks are substantially lower than that of custom ASIC hardware. There are two types of FPGA: 1) One time programmable and 2) SRAM-programmable. <p> At present, we are aware of a variety of FPGA-based DSP efforts in automatic target recognition [14], Viterbi decoding [15], image compression [14] and digital audio <ref> [7] </ref>. We are not aware of any other project to date which uses FPGA-based DSP for such demanding high-speed radar processing in such a small and low-power environment.

Reference-contexts: The first type of FPGA uses anti-fuse technology and acts much like a large PROM. The SRAM-programmable FPGAs can be reconfigured time and time again which allows in-system changes and also the emerging technique of dynamic reconfigurability <ref> [8] </ref>. Although our current application does not exploit dynamic reconfiguration, SRAM-programmability is still a virtue for system debugging, late design specification changes, and system tuning. Possible uses of dynamic reconfiguration for the UAV project are currently being explored.

Reference-contexts: It has been proposed that a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algo rithm can be realized. Also, work is being done to im-plement floating point arithmetic in FPGAs <ref> [12] </ref>. This could be an attractive option for future use, making it possible to gain a wider dynamic range without losing the necessary precision. 5.

Reference-contexts: They have also involved fairly complex design techniques and tools. Fortunately, the improvement in FPGA semiconductor technology and the emergence of software and hardware platforms such as that provided by Giga-Ops, Virtual Computer <ref> [13] </ref> and others, means that FPGA-based DSP can be embedded in a wide range of applications.
