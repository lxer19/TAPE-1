Reference-contexts: For example, A is a global action in Result (A; s), but a primitive action in In (A; g). To be sure, there are other proposals in the literature for extending the situation calculus to allow expressions for concurrent actions. Most introduce new operators on actions (cf. <ref> [4, 25] </ref>). For example, in [4] a new operator "+" is introduced, with the intuitive meaning that a + b is the action of executing a and b simultaneously.

Reference-contexts: For example, we can introduce RES (a; s 1 ; s 2 ) with the intuitive meaning that s 2 is one of the situations resulted from executing a, along with possibly some other actions, in s 1 . This is essentially the approach taken in <ref> [5, 21] </ref>, and others. The drawback of this approach is that it does not explicitly list the additional actions that cause the transition from s 1 to s 2 .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The histories of the frame problem [18], and of the particular Yale Shooting Problem (YSP) which has become its best known illustration <ref> [6] </ref>, have followed a disturbing pattern. The frame problem itself, although introduced in the context of formalizing common sense, was never formally defined, and was only illustrated through suggestive examples. This is an initial disturbing factor. <p> Thus if T is an epistemologically complete theory according to classical entailment j=, then we say that T is an epistemologically complete monotonic theory. In the following, we first re-examine the Yale Shooting Problem <ref> [6] </ref> as an extended example of the foregoing definitions. The YSP turns out to be a very special case of the class of theories we consider later. 5 The Yale shooting problem revisited In the YSP we consider three actions: Shoot, Load, and W ait. <p> It was implied in [17] that the frame axioms can be replaced by minimizing the following abnormality predicate ab with H allowed to vary: 8pas::ab (p; a; s) oe [H (p; s) j H (p; Result (a; s))]: (9) The main technical result of <ref> [6] </ref> is that this does not work. We mentioned in the introduction the slew of proposed solutions, all criticized on some grounds or others. Surprisingly, most of them are actually correct relative to the above monotonic theory.

Reference-contexts: Given these shaky foundations, it is not surprising that subsequent research on the topic became increasingly splintered and controversial. From the outset there were arguments that the YSP is not a problem at all [16]. Simultaneously there were several proposed solutions to it <ref> [26, 10, 8, 11, 7] </ref>.

We pick as an example chronological minimization [26], although other proposals, such as those in [10] and <ref> [8] </ref>, would work as well. 1 For the full definition of chronological minimization the reader is referred to [26]; we only remind the reader that in this framework the preferred models are those in which the minimized predicate is true as late as possible, rather than as infrequently as possible. <p> Then the results in section 6 can be applied. Our strategy for coping with the new action-oriented frame problem will be similar to the one we used for the traditional frame problem. Let us illustrate it using a version of Kautz's stolen car problem <ref> [8] </ref>. 10 The Stolen Car Problem revisited The scenario is as follows. Initially, the car is present, but after two waiting periods it is gone. When was it stolen? To formalize this problem, we first have to decide how the waiting periods are represented.

The frame problem itself, although introduced in the context of formalizing common sense, was never formally defined, and was only illustrated through suggestive examples. <p> The complications will arise from a more complex definition of epistemological completeness, resulting difficulty in determining whether a given theory is indeed epistemologically complete, and a nonmonotonic mechanism that is more complex than CWA. 3 Logical preliminaries We shall base our presentation on the situation calculus <ref> [18] </ref>, although we believe that a similar treatment is possible in other frameworks such as temporal logics. For now we shall adopt the standard situation calculus, which precludes the representation of certain notions such as concurrent actions.

Reference-contexts: Our formulation of Comp (T ) can be considered a generalization of that in <ref> [20] </ref> where domain constraints have to be hand-coded into the effect axioms.

Reference-contexts: The solution is, of course, to omit all the :F light (x; y) assertions, and infer :F light (A; B) 3 `by default' in the absence of F light (A; B). This is a simple application of the closed-world assumption (CWA) <ref> [22] </ref>, and the equivalent monotonic formulation can be regenerated from the abbreviated representation through database completion [3]. This concise representation is also epistemologically complete since it too entails either F light (A; B) or :F light (A; B) for all pairs of cities A and B, albeit nonmonotonically.

These types of reasoning are investigated in detail in <ref> [27] </ref>. 10.2 A nonmonotonic completion Although T 1 gives the right answers to the stolen car problem, it does so at the expense of explicit inheritance and frame axioms. We now provide an equivalent nonmonotonic theory that avoids them.

Reference-contexts: The idea is not startling. A similar idea is used in verifying negation-as-failure [3]. It seems that several researchers have entertained the idea of verifying a nonmonotonic theory of action against a monotonic one (for example, it is listed as future work in <ref> [28] </ref>), even if no one to date has actually followed this course. Central to our project is the definition of an epistemological completeness condition for deterministic actions, whose intuitive purpose is to determine whether sufficient axioms are included in a theory.
