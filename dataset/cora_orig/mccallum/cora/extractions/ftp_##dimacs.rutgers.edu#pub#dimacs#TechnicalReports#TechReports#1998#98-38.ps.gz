Reference-contexts: While there are numerous proofs of this fundamental homogeneous inequality, see e.g. Hardy, Littlewood, and Polya [5], Bullen, Mitrinovic, and Vasic [3], Mitrinovic, Pecaric, and Fink [18], and Alzer <ref> [1] </ref>; in the presence of a proper subspace not containing the center, the new minimization is a nontrivial problem. A more general version of the above problem is the minimization of the ratio of an arbitrary linear function to the geometric mean, over the positive points of an arbitrary subspace.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to show that this duality is equivalent to Gordan's theorem, see Kalantari [11]. Gordan's theorem (see Dantzig <ref> [2] </ref>, Schrijver [20]) is the following: given a real m fi n matrix B, either there exists x 0; x 6= 0, such that Bx = 0, or there exists y such that B T y &gt; 0; but not both.

Reference-contexts: The Path-Following algorithm not only results in the best-known iteration complexity for solving LP (see e.g. <ref> [4] </ref>), while being one of the simplest of such algorithms, but also is an algorithm that is capable of solving more general diagonal matrix scaling problems than that considered in [16], as well as having the capability of solving SP and HSP.

Reference-contexts: Our study of what we now call scaling dualities, and their algorithmic significance began in Kalantari <ref> [6] </ref>, and was continued in [7]-[11]. We emphasize that the goal of the present paper is to present these significant dualities for the very special problems considered, and via an elementary proof. Also, to introduce two conceptually simple, but very capable polynomial-time algorithms that are motivated by these dualities. <p> Remark 3. For i = 2 0 , Corollary 2.4 implies that either Karmarkar's canonical LP is solvable, or the potential function f (x) is unbounded from below; but not both. In fact Karmarkar's algorithm, [15], can be viewed as an algorithmic proof of this fact, see also Kalantari <ref> [6] </ref>, [9]. Another duality implied by this corollary is that either Karmarkar's canonical LP is solvable, or there there exists d 2 W " K ffi such that P e;d D e c &gt; 0, but not both.

Reference-contexts: This problem is in fact Karmarkar's canonical linear programming [15]. A more general, more interesting, and more important problem than Karmarkar's canonical LP problem is when the linear form is replaced with a positive semidefinite quadratic form, considered in Kalantari <ref> [7] </ref>. Indeed, as proved in [7], by removing the positive semidefiniteness assumption, the zero-finding problem becomes NP-complete. Linear programming is also equivalent to the problem of testing if the convex-hull of a given set of points in the Euclidean space contains the origin. <p> This problem is in fact Karmarkar's canonical linear programming [15].

Indeed, the latter problem is more general and more important than Karmarkar's canonical linear programming problem [15], which is the following problem: given c 2 &lt; n , determine if c T x = 0, for some x 2 W " K, x 6= 0.

Reference-contexts: This duality which implies Gordan's theorem gives rise to a simple variation of Karmarkar's algorithm (see Kalantari <ref> [10] </ref>), a polynomial-time algorithm that actually establishes this duality. 3. Proof of Theorem 2.1. Proof.

Reference-contexts: The corresponding proof however becomes more involved than the simple proofs presented in this paper. For the proof of some of the corresponding parts of Theorem 2.1, as derived for general 6 BAHMAN KALANTARI convex homogeneous functions, see Kalantari <ref> [11] </ref>. <p> It is easy to show that this duality is equivalent to Gordan's theorem, see Kalantari <ref> [11] </ref>. Gordan's theorem (see Dantzig [2], Schrijver [20]) is the following: given a real m fi n matrix B, either there exists x 0; x 6= 0, such that Bx = 0, or there exists y such that B T y &gt; 0; but not both. <p> When = e, this is the quasi doubly-stochastic scaling problem, a problem which has been of considerable interest for matrices of nonnegative entries, see e.g. Marshal and Olkin [17], Kalantari <ref> [11] </ref>. Another statement implied by this corollary is that &gt; 0 if and only if given any &gt; 0, there exists d &gt; 0, such that D QD e = e . In other words, there exists a diagonal scaling of Q such that e is a fixed-point.

Reference-contexts: The implementation of the above two algorithms for *-SP, *-HSP, and *-ASP requires the computation of a lower bounds on , assuming that it is positive. For the computation of such a lower bound for the case where Q has rational or algebraic entries, see <ref> [12] </ref>. These algorithms can also be applied to solve Karmarkar's canonical LP. All is needed is to replace the linear form c T x with (c T x) 2 . <p> In particular, taking = e, the Path-Following algorithm gives an O ( p nkuk * ) iteration complexity for solving *-approximate version of Karmarkar's problem. As usual, over the rational inputs * can be taken to be O (2 L ), where L is the size of LP (see <ref> [12] </ref> for different notions of size, over the rationals or the algebraic numbers).

Reference-contexts: The scaling dualities, the bounds, and the algorithms are special cases of a much more general theory on convex programming, developed by the author (see Kalantari <ref> [13] </ref>). For instance, via the scaling dualities semidefinite programming is a problem dual to a generalization of the classical trace-determinant ratio minimization over the positive definite points of a given subspace of the Hilbert space of symmetric matrices. <p> One of the major ingredient is the scaling dualities. Other ingredients are significant bounding theorems that will be stated without proof. The proof of these bounds is given in <ref> [13] </ref> and in much more generality. Another ingredient is a theorem that combines two fundamental but most basic properties from Nesterov and Nemirovskii's theory on self-concordance, [19]. <p> mention that linearly constrained convex quadratic programming can be formulated as the problem of computing a nontrivial root of the homogeneous function 1 2 x T Qx=e T x + c T x over W " K, for some positive semidefinite Q, and c 2 &lt; n , see Kalantari <ref> [13] </ref>. In fact, most of the scaling dualities implied by Theorem 2.1 can be stated in much more generality, where the underlying cone is an arbitrary closed convex pointed cone, and an arbitrary convex form defined over this cone (see x 5). <p> Also, to introduce two conceptually simple, but very capable polynomial-time algorithms that are motivated by these dualities. Indeed, the linear programming/matrix scaling algorithm of Khachiyan and Kalantari [16] is also based on a scaling duality, implied by Gordan's theorem (see <ref> [13] </ref>). Remark 1. When W = &lt; n , Corollary 2.2 implies that either there exists x 0; x 6= 0, such that Qx = 0, or there exists d &gt; 0 such that Qd &gt; 0; but not both. <p> The case of D e QD e e = e scaling was shown to be polynomially solvable in [16] via a simple analysis, see also <ref> [13] </ref>. But in fact all other cases considered in this paper, including matrix scaling over a given subspace, are polynomially solvable. However, the polynomial-time solvability of the subspace constrained case is considerably demanding, requiring several important and nontrivial auxiliary results (see x 5). <p> We will then state without proof the main ingredients, other than the scaling dualities already proved. Finally, we will justify how the main ingredients result in the stated complexity results. For the proof of the stated theorems and in much more generality, see Kalantari <ref> [13] </ref>. 10 BAHMAN KALANTARI Given * 2 (0; 1], *-HP, *-SP, *-HSP, and *-ASP are defined as follows. *-HP is to compute d 2 W "K "S such that (d) *, or proving that such point does not exist. <p> Consider the following Potential-Reduction algorithm: Potential-Reduction: Initialization. Let d = d 0 . Iterative Step. Replace d with d 0 = N EW ( ; d) and repeat. Theorem 5.1. (Potential-Reduction Complexity Theorem, Kalantari <ref> [13] </ref>) Assume that e. Let * be in (0; 1). Consider the Potential-Reduction algorithm, and let = exp [ 2 (d 0 ) 1 + ln R = supfexp ( 2 F (x)) : x 2 W " K ffi ; kxk = 1g. <p> Phase II. Replace d with d 0 = N EW (f (t) ; d) and repeat. Theorem 5.2. (Path-Following Complexity Theorem, Kalantari <ref> [13] </ref>) Assume e. Let * be in (0; 1). Consider the Path-Following algorithm. AG-Mean Inequality, LP Matrix Scaling, Gordan's Theorem 11 If = 0, the number of iterations to solve *-HP is O ( p kuk * + ln ln kQk). <p> Moreover, suppose that ffi t (d) 1=4, then ffi t 0 (d) 1=4, where t 0 = t exp ( c fl p ). Now we state some other significant results. Theorem 5.4. (Kalantari <ref> [13] </ref>, x 8) Assume that e. Suppose that d 2 W "K ffi satisfies ffi (d) &lt; ffi fl =2. Then, ffi (d) kP ;d r ;d (e )k = O kQk ffi (d) : Suppose that &gt; 0. <p> Then, kP ;d rf ;d (e )k = O kQkffi t (d)( 1 ) c fl : Theorem 5.5. (Kalantari <ref> [13] </ref>, x 9) Let the k-th iterate of the Potential-Reduction algorithm be denoted by d k . If ffi (d k ) ffi fl , then d k 2k~ fl Theorem 5.6. (Kalantari [13], x 9) Suppose that &gt; 0. <p> rf ;d (e )k = O kQkffi t (d)( 1 ) c fl : Theorem 5.5.

(Kalantari [13], x 9) Suppose that &gt; 0. Then, for all x 2 W " K ffi we have ln X (x) 2 : The following theorem is the final ingredient, a significant consequence of the scaling dualities: Theorem 5.7. (Kalantari [13], x 10) Let fl be a number in (0; 1]. <p> fl , then d k 2k~ fl Theorem 5.6. (Kalantari <ref> [13] </ref>, x 9) Suppose that &gt; 0. Then, for all x 2 W " K ffi we have ln X (x) 2 : The following theorem is the final ingredient, a significant consequence of the scaling dualities: Theorem 5.7. (Kalantari [13], x 10) Let fl be a number in (0; 1]. Given t 2 (0; 1], suppose that d 2 W " K ffi satisfies kP ;d rf (t) 2 fl. Let ^ d = td. <p> Hence the claimed complexity for solving *-ASP. From Theorem 5.3 it also follows that (see <ref> [13] </ref>) once we have obtained a point x k such that ffi (x k ) &lt; minfffi fl ; * 3 (1 !(ffi fl ))g, we have (x k ) fl This together with the bound in Theorem 5.6 gives the desired complexity for solving *-SP, or *-HSP. <p> The latter three problems are genuinely dual to the HP formulation of convex programming problems, i.e., HP is solvable if and only if the other three are not. Indeed, as shown in <ref> [13] </ref>, given an arbitrary closed convex pointed cone K in a finite dimensional space, a logarithmically homogeneous barrier F (x) for the interior of K, a subspace W , and a homogeneous function with homogeneous degree p &gt; 0, the scaling equation can be defined as P d r d (e
