Abstract: Preconditioning methods can accelerate the convergence of gradient-based iterative methods for tomographic image reconstruction and image restoration. Circulant preconditioners have been used extensively for shift-invariant problems. Diagonal preconditioners offer some improvement in convergence rate, but do not incorporate the structure of the Hessian matrices in imaging problems. For inverse problems that are approximately shift-invariant (i.e. approximately block-Toeplitz or block-circulant Hessians), circulant or Fourier-based precondi-tioners can provide remarkable acceleration. However, in applications with nonuniform noise variance (such as arises from Poisson statistics in emission tomography and in quantum-limited optical imaging), the Hessian of the (penalized) weighted least-squares objective function is quite shift-variant, and the Fourier precon-ditioner performs poorly. Additional shift-variance is caused by edge-preserving regularization methods based on nonquadratic penalty functions. This paper describes new preconditioners that more accurately approximate the Hessian matrices of shift-variant imaging problems. Compared to diagonal or Fourier preconditioning, the new preconditioners lead to significantly faster convergence rates for the unconstrained conjugate-gradient (CG) iteration. Applications to position emission tomography (PET) illustrate the method.

Reference-contexts: 1 For brevity, we have omitted several preconditioners from <ref> [14] </ref>, but have retained the matrix numberings for consistency. ICIP 97 3 Implementing M 5 appears to require 2 (p + 1) 2D FFT's per iteration. Although this is considerably less computation than required for M 3 , it remains impractical. <p> Then M 9 simplifies to: M F = 2 Q 0 1 ( 0 )Q; (17) which is essentially the standard Fourier preconditioner for shift-invariant problems, e.g. [7]. Implementing M 9 using FFTs required about 4-13% more computation time than the CG algorithm with no preconditioning <ref> [14, 15] </ref>, yet the improvement in conver gence rate was much greater, as the results below show.
