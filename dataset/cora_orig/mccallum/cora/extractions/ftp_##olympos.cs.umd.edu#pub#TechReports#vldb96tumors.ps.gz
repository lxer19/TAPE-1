Abstract: We examine the problem of finding similar tumor shapes. Starting from a natural similarity function (the so-called `max morphological distance'), we showed how to lower-bound it and how to search for nearest neighbors in large collections of tumor-like shapes. Specifically, we used state-of-the-art concepts from morphology, namely the `pattern spectrum' of a shape, to map each shape to a point in n-dimensional space. Following [19, 36], we organized the n-d points in an R-tree. We showed that the L 1 (= max) norm in the n-d space lower-bounds the actual distance. This guarantees no false dismissals for range queries. In addition, we developed a nearest-neighbor algorithm that also guarantees no false dismissals. Finally, we implemented the method, and we tested it against a testbed of realistic tumor shapes, using an established tumor-growth model of Murray Eden[15]. The experiments showed that our method is up to 27 times faster than straightforward sequential scanning. fl His work was partially supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants IRI-9205273 and IRI-8958546, with matching funds from Empress Software Inc. and Thinking Machines Inc.

Reference-contexts: The importance of the size distribution and the pattern spectrum is that they summarize important shape characteristics in the sense that they possess high discriminatory power, as reported in <ref> [2, 53] </ref>. 3.3 Distance functions Given two shapes X 1 and X 2 , a natural distance function involves penalizing the non-common areas. Formally, 9 circular disc pattern spectrum square pattern spectrum a square of side 10. <p> Given the success of the pattern spectrum as a means to capture shape information <ref> [2, 46, 45, 63] </ref>, we started with its coefficients as good features. More specifically, we use the coefficients y X of the size distribution (Eq. 7), which contains exactly the same information as the pattern spectrum. Thus, we `penalize' two shapes for differences at several scales.

Reference-contexts: We mainly focus on matching similar shapes. In section 6, we discuss how our approach can be naturally extended to handle more complicated queries. Some terminology is necessary. Following <ref> [19] </ref>, we distinguish between (a) range queries (e.g., find shapes that are within distance * from the desirable query shape) and (b) nearest neighbor queries (e.g., find the first k closest shapes to the query shape) An orthogonal axis of classification distinguishes between whole-matching and sub-pattern matching: In whole-matching queries, the <p> Section 5 gives the experiments. Section 6 discusses how to use the proposed algorithms for more general problems. Section 7 gives the conclusions. 2 Survey 2.1 Multimedia Indexing The state of the art in multimedia indexing is based on feature extraction <ref> [36, 19] </ref>. The idea is to extract n numerical features from the objects of interest, mapping them into points in n-dimensional space. Then, any multi-dimensional indexing method can be used to organize, cluster and efficiently search the resulting points. Such methods are traditionally called Spatial Access Methods (SAMs). <p> The major challenge is to find feature extraction functions that preserve the dis-similarity/distance between the objects as much as possible. In <ref> [1, 19] </ref> we showed that the F-index method can guarantee 3 that there will not be any false dismissals, if the actual distance is lower-bounded by the distance in feature space. <p> Then we have: Lemma 1 (Lower-Bounding) To guarantee no false dismissals for range queries, the feature extraction function F () should satisfy the following formula: D f eature (F (O 1 ); F (O 2 )) D object (O 1 ; O 2 ) (1) Proof: In <ref> [19] </ref>. Thus, the search for range queries involves two steps. For a query object Q with tolerance *, we 1. Discard quickly those objects whose feature vectors are too far away. That is, we retrieve the objects X such that D feature (F (Q); F (E)) &lt; *. 2. <p> Sub-pattern matching: The problem is to detect a similar s fi s shape within a collection of S fi S bitmaps (s S). The idea is to use sliding, overlapping windows, as we suggested in <ref> [19] </ref> for time sequences. <p> Thus, the problem is reduced to the whole-matching problem, which we have just solved. Algorithms to minimize the space requirements of the feature vectors, as well as to handle queries of arbitrary sizes, have been suggested in <ref> [19] </ref> for 1-d time sequences; all these techniques can be easily extended to 2-d images (and, in fact, arrays of arbitrary dimensionality). 2. Time-evolution: Currently, we considered static, 2-d images. <p> This distance function is based on modern signal processing methods, and specifically mathematical morphology. The distance is invariant to rotations and translations, and gives similar attention to all levels of detail (`scales'). From the database end, we used the `Feature index' (F-index) approach <ref> [1, 19] </ref>, which is the latest in multimedia indexing. The main contribution of this work is that it manages to couple the max-morphological distance with the F-index.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper proposes an algorithm which rapidly searches for "similar shapes". Such an algorithm would have broad applications in electronic commerce (e.g., `find shapes similar to a screw-driver'), photo-journalism <ref> [20] </ref>, etc., but would be particularly useful in medical imaging. During the past twenty years, the development of new modalities such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have substantially increased the number and complexity of images presented to radiologists and other physicians. <p> Following [1], we call the resulting index as the `F-index' (for `feature index').

The idea is to extract n numerical features from the objects of interest, mapping them into points in n-dimensional space. Then, any multi-dimensional indexing method can be used to organize, cluster and efficiently search the resulting points. Such methods are traditionally called Spatial Access Methods (SAMs).

One such function is founded on ideas from the field of Mathematical Morphology.

Reference-contexts: Thus, given two tumor-like shapes, we would like to examine differences at several scales before we pronounce the two shapes as `similar'. Even for general shapes, there exists substantial evidence that scale-space behavior is an important and highly discriminating shape "signature" <ref> [61, 42, 8] </ref>. 3 Introduction to Morphology Our goal is to choose a distance function between shapes which will be invariant to translation and rotation, and which will `give attention' to all levels of detail. One such function is founded on ideas from the field of Mathematical Morphology.

Reference-contexts: East/West ones, with p N S not necessarily equal to p EW . t = 1 t = 5 t = 10 t = 25 t = 50 t = 100 The Eden model is the simplest of a hierarchy of models: in increasing generality, we have the Williams-Bjerkness model <ref> [62] </ref>, the Contact Process [31], and the Interacting Particle Systems [13, 40].

Reference-contexts: In these cases, we typically use the (weighted) Euclidean distance of the vectors. * representation through a simpler shape, such as polygonalization [24, 50, 54, 60, 39] and Mathe matical Morphology <ref> [63, 47, 44, 11, 7] </ref>, which we shall examine in detail next. <p> Given the success of the pattern spectrum as a means to capture shape information <ref> [2, 46, 45, 63] </ref>, we started with its coefficients as good features. More specifically, we use the coefficients y X of the size distribution (Eq. 7), which contains exactly the same information as the pattern spectrum. Thus, we `penalize' two shapes for differences at several scales.
