Title: ACQUIRING EFFECTIVE KNOWLEDGE OF ENVIRONMENT GEOMETRY FOR MINIMUM-TIME CONTROL OF A MOBILE ROBOT

Abstract: Planning minimum time trajectories among obstacles would seem to require the availability of an accurate global representation of environment geometry. This poses several problems for path planning for autonomous mobile robots (AMR's) which are not provided with an a priori description of their environment. First, AMR's may need to travel along previously unseen routes. Second, even when the routes have been traversed previously, it can be difficult to acquire an accurate description of the geometry of the environment along the route. A path-planning approach is described whose initial trajectory along some route may be guaranteed safe on the basis of local information alone. On subsequent traversals of the same route, an approximation to a minimum-time trajectory is found without employing an accurate global representation of the environment.

Reference-contexts: Subsequent figures show the trajectories that result from repeated trials along the path and the positions of the frontiers. In figures 5 through 8, the initial control was derived from a map of the environment generated by the NX-SIM qualitative mapping system <ref> [6] </ref>. The locations of the nodes of the topological map generated by NX--SIM along the path from the start point to the goal were chosen as the initial intermediate path points.
