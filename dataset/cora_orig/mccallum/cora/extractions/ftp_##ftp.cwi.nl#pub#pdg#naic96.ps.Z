Abstract: We show that the theory of causation that makes use of causal networks is intimately related to nonmonotonic temporal reasoning. Applying the theory of causal networks in a logical context yields a new approach to nonmonotonic temporal reasoning that can be proven to be a generalization and/or correction of many existing ones, and that provides new insights on the old question on how, and whether at all, causation may be defined in logical terms.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the `logicist' tradition of AI Research, one wants to formalize common-sense reasoning using mathematical logic. In common-sense temporal reasoning, this leads to the so-called frame problem <ref> [1] </ref>: how can one properly model the common sense intuition that most facts about the world tend to stay the same over time, unless an action takes place that affects them? If one wants to formalize this notion of inertia or persistence in a logical theory, some nonmonotonic methods are needed.

Reference-contexts: However, the obvious way to formalize it using nonmonotonic logic does not work well, as was shown by Hanks and McDermott when they introduced the famous Yale Shooting Problem (YSP) <ref> [2] </ref>: even for a very simple reasoning task, the inferences one can make using the logic do not coincide with those of common-sense. The YSP has provoked lots of different solutions. <p> Time-points will be equated to the integers. The predicate Holds (g; t) will denote that generalized fluent g is the case at time t. As an example, suppose we have the following domain (the so-called Yale Shooting Domain <ref> [2] </ref>): there is a person (typically named Fred) that can be alive or not; there is a gun that can be loaded or not; there is an action `load' which loads the gun, an action `wait' which has no effects at all and an action `shoot', which, if performed when the <p> However, using the domain introduced above, Hanks and McDermott showed that the selection criterion we just gave does not work well at all! <ref> [2] </ref>. If one uses it on T YSP then not only does one get the intended model M 1 in which Fred dies (i.e. <p> Thus neither of the two models is preferred over the other. The YSP does not disappear if one realizes the same idea of minimizing all change using more advanced nonmonotonic and/or temporal logics <ref> [2, 7] </ref>. There are lots of solutions to the YSP, most of which have problems of their own. These are often instances of the ramification problem or the qualification problem [7].

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, in recent years there have been a number of papers on the use of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for the modeling of causal relations. The theory on these `causal networks' is by now well-developed. They are actually put to use, mainly in statistics <ref> [3] </ref> but also in many other contexts like for example belief revision/update [4] and analysis of counterfactual statements [5]. We will call the view on causation that is implied by these networks `Pearl's account of Causation', because it is mainly associated with J. <p> all unexplainable facts and the direct causes of a proposition P are known, the truth value of P becomes independent of information about all propositions in the causal network that are not descendants of P . (this is a version of the Markovian Property in the probabilistic literature on causation <ref> [3] </ref>). For example, in the YSP domain this implies that given (the truth values of) Load and Loaded at t 1, Loaded at time t becomes independent of Alive at t.

Reference-contexts: Due to length constraints to this paper, we cannot properly formalize all notions involved we hope the reader can get the general idea from our approximate formulations and examples. However, whenever in the following something is stated only `roughly', a precise formulation can be found in the technical report <ref> [11] </ref>. 2 Problems with persistence The basic idea in the kind of reasoning we are interested in is to formalize common-sense knowledge about some domain of interest as axioms of some logical theory T . <p> The theory we are about to present provides new insights on all of these issues <ref> [11] </ref>. 3 A solution using Pearl's account of causation Many felt that the YSP had something to do with causation: the change of Alive is caused by the Shoot-action, while there is no cause for the change of Loaded in the spurious model. <p> One can show <ref> [11] </ref> that in most existing causal approaches domain knowledge is formalized in essentially this way. Now from a Pearlian viewpoint, we can see that what is actually formalized by axioms like (5) are the sufficient causes for fluents to hold at some time. <p> This means that what S 0 really must do is to perform steps 2, 3, 4 and 5 of I 0 as step 1 has already been done by the person who formalized the domain knowledge and indeed, this is exactly the way S 0 is defined in <ref> [11] </ref>. 5 Validation of S 0 and I 0 two theorems In order to prove that two different approaches, say A and B, are really equivalent, one needs some way of effectively translating descriptions of reasoning domains of A into those of B and vice versa. <p> This enables us to prove the following: Correspondence theorem 1 (roughly stated) For all theories T NC for our approach and T B for Baker's approach with T NC ~ NC,B T B which are such that T B is in some precisely defined (in <ref> [11] </ref>) format, I 0 applied to T NC and Baker's reasoning method applied to T B both yield the same models in terms of what fluents hold at what time. <p> All the known problems with Baker's approach [8] can be seen to stem from either a) or b); the format in which T B must be in order for the theorem to hold, rules out domain descriptions where these problems may occur. Concerning S 0 , we proved <ref> [11] </ref> equivalences between restricted versions of S 0 and the approaches of McCain and Turner [14] and Baral and Gelfond's L 3 [10] 6 . It becomes clear at first glance that Lin's recent approach [13] is almost identical to S 0 . <p> For example, causal axiom (5) corresponds to noncausal axiom (1). Main theorem (roughly stated) For any two theories T C and T NC with T C ~ C,NC T NC we have that, for some precisely defined (in <ref> [11] </ref>) class of problem domains, any model M is selected by S 0 for T C iff it is also selected by I 0 for T NC .
