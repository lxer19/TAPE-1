Abstract: A very natural approach to categorization is similarity-based clustering. We propose a visual representation which can be used with such a mechanism for the acquisition of spatial relation categories. We also show how supervision can be helpful in cases where basic similarity is low by proposing a learning mechanism which operates both in the presence and in the absence of words. This acquisition process can be viewed as categorization of instances of various spatial configurations. And a very natural approach to categorization (especially unsupervised) is similarity : if two instances are sufficiently similar, they belong to the same category (Goldstone, 1994a, 1994b, Rosch and Mervis, 1975, Smith, 1992). In order to apply such a criterion in the case of spatial configurations, we have to specify representations for our instances and also a way in which their similarity can be judged. On the representation issue, we could start with a picture ; this is what humans get as raw input. The first step in recognizing a spatial relation in the picture, is definitely to find the objects that take part in it. Then, we need a way to represent the locations of these objects within the picture, since this information is what matters for defining a spatial relationship. Its interesting to observe that, for the kinds of spatial relation categories used in human languages, specific attributes of the participating objects are irrelevant ( a red elephant ABOVE a green mouse, is as good an instance of ABOVE as an angry sky ABOVE a calm sea). What is really essential to know is just which segments of the picture correspond to different objects. Also, if were just concerned with relations between two objects, which well call Trajector and Landmark (Langacker, 1987), the essential location information needed for specifying the spatial relationship, is position of the Trajector relative to the Landmark. The exact location of the Landmark in the picture is irrelevant (a book (Trajector) is ON the table (Landmark) no matter where the table is located in the visual field). We chose to incorporate the abstractions over object specificity and Landmark position in our input representation. We assume the existence of a first processing stage that takes a 2D visual bitmap and outputs a 2D map where a number is attached to every map bit, which signifies the object it belongs to (Mozer, Zemel and Behrmann, 1991). Theres a unique number for each object, and for the sake of simplicity, well assume that Trajector bits are marked with 1, Landmark bits with 2 and background bits with 0. These numbers tell us whether two bits belong to the same or different objects, but contain no information about the exact identities of the objects involved (a red elephant Trajector and an angry sky Trajector will just be two regions of 1-bits in the 2D map). The shape of the objects is retained in this representation. A second processing stage, which takes the previous 2D map as input, produces a representation with explicit
