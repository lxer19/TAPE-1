Title: A MATRIX SYNTHESIS APPROACH TO THERMAL PLACEMENT

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the thermal placement problem for gate arrays. We introduce a new combinatorial optimization problem MSP (Matrix Synthesis Problem) to model the thermal placement problem. Given a list of mn non-negative real numbers and an integer t, MSP constructs a m fi n matrix out of the given numbers such that the maximum sum among all tfit sub-matrices is minimized. We show that MSP is NP-complete and present several provably good approximation algorithms for the problem. We also demonstrate that our thermal placement strategy is flexible enough to allow simultaneous consideration of other objectives such as wiring.

Reference-contexts: However, since thermal placement of gates within a single chip was not of major concern in the past, existing placement algorithms [7] only focus on minimizing area and delay but do not consider heat dissipation. One exception is <ref> [1] </ref> but it only addresses thermal issues during IC floorplanning. In this paper, we consider the thermal placement problem for gate arrays.

Reference-contexts: QUESTION: Can X be partitioned into q multi-sets X 0 ; : : : ; X q1 such that for 0 r q 1, P B? Note that 3-PARTITION is NP-complete <ref> [3] </ref>. Theorem 1 For every fixed t 2, MSP is NP-complete. Proof outline: Let t be any fixed integer greater than or equal to 2. Given an instance of 3-PARTITION, we can reduce it to an instance of MSP with that particular value of t.

Reference-contexts: For examples, the two recent high-performance chips, Alpha 21164 and PowerPC 620, consume 50 W and 30 W, respectively, on 3 cm 2 dies. It can be extrapolated that a 10 cm 2 next-generation microprocessor, clocked at 500 MHz would consume 300 W <ref> [6] </ref>. Consumed power is converted directly into dissipated heat. In the past decade, heat produced by a chip has increased from 2.2 to 10 W/cm 2 due to the continuous increase of the clock frequency and the total number of transistors [8]. <p> A circuit with considerable power consumption requires extra expensive cost to remove heat at the packaging level, and therefore the reduction of power dissipation is required at the chip design stages. (See <ref> [6] </ref> for a survey of current research efforts in power minimization in IC design.) Even when the total power consumption of a chip is constrained, an unevenly distributed heat dissipation by the gates in the chip may produce hot spots which can lead to reliability problems.

Higher temperature not only affects circuit performance directly by slowing down the transistors on CMOS chips but also decreases their reliability.
