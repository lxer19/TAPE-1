Reference-contexts: In section 4, we discuss the problem of preserving multiple past states. Finally, in section 5, we make concluding remarks about our work. 2 Problems with previous work Of numerous time concepts proposed to date, we select some and highlight the confusion among them. Copeland and Maier <ref> [CM84] </ref> introduced two types of time, event time and transaction time. According to their description, the event time is the time an event, which gives rise to a change 3 to an object, happens in real world. <p> Basically, the logical time is the same as the event time in the sense that both are time of real world, i.e., the true time with which an object changes. However, the physical time is different from the transaction time of <ref> [CM84] </ref>, even though the two times have been treated identically as both are the recording time of data. The physical time was intended to be a reference time for the logical time to model retroactive and proactive updates. <p> What if the fact were recorded in Sep. or later instead of Aug.? Does that mean Smith received a retroactive promotion in Sep. or later? In addition, the validity dealt with in [LDE + 84] is in essence the same with the effective validity of <ref> [CM84] </ref>, provided that the event time and the logical time are for modeling of the same real-world validity. The difference is that in [LDE + 84] they used an additional time to capture the semantics of retroactive and proactive updates. We will discuss this problem further in section 4. <p> The transaction time in rollback databases is equivalent to the transaction time of <ref> [CM84] </ref> in that rollback databases are in fact temporal databases using the registration-based validity. In contrast, the transaction time in their temporal databases is the same with the physical time of [LDE + 84] in the sense that both times are used to model retroactive and proactive updates. <p> However, the valid and transaction times of [GY88] were in fact not those of [SA85], but the event and transaction times of <ref> [CM84] </ref>, respectively. To summarize, we identify several problems with the previous approaches. First, we think there has been a dichotomous classification of time concepts, i.e., reality vs. representation (or real-world database. 5 vs. database-world) [SA85]. <p> As shown in Figure 12, the event time of <ref> [CM84] </ref>, the logical, valid, and user-defined times are in essence the same time in the sense that they all represent an arbitrary single sort of validity; the sort of validity is determined by characteristic functions, or more practically, by users' needs. The transaction time of [CM84] and that of [SA85] used <p> 12, the event time of <ref> [CM84] </ref>, the logical, valid, and user-defined times are in essence the same time in the sense that they all represent an arbitrary single sort of validity; the sort of validity is determined by characteristic functions, or more practically, by users' needs. The transaction time of [CM84] and that of [SA85] used in rollback databases represent the 8 As mentioned before, we regard all the events as being the same kind, such as events of promotion. Especially, E l should not be misunderstood as an event of error-discovering. <p> Especially, E l should not be misunderstood as an event of error-discovering. Such an event, bearing a different semantics, should have occurred somewhere between time points, 10 and 15. 22 Reference Time concept Representing sort of validity <ref> [CM84] </ref> Event any sort of validity Transaction registration-based validity [LDE + 84] Logical any sort of validity Physical none (reference time for logical time) [SA85] Valid any sort of validity Transaction in rollback DB registration-based validity Transaction in temporal DB none (reference time for valid time) User-defined any sort of validity

Reference-contexts: Handling multidimensional times in temporal databases requires a systematic interpretation methodology. We have extended this work to two-dimensional representations of time which correspond to the combinations of valid and transaction times and valid and event times <ref> [Kim92] </ref>. The notion of valid period is extended to a valid pattern in the two-dimensional times. Currently, we are investigating the three-dimensional representation using all the three time concepts. 25

In our view, earlier attempts at clarifying various time concepts introduced for enriching the semantics of temporal databases have only added more confusion. <p> If we adopt the event time, Smith's associate professorship becomes valid from Aug. 1985. If we take the transaction time, as they actually did, it becomes valid from Sep. 1985. We will call, tentatively, the former validity effective validity and the latter registration-based validity. Lum and others <ref> [LDE + 84] </ref> proposed other kinds of time, logical time and physical time. Basically, the logical time is the same as the event time in the sense that both are time of real world, i.e., the true time with which an object changes. <p> We should be able to notice the problem with this approach. What if the fact were recorded in Sep. or later instead of Aug.? Does that mean Smith received a retroactive promotion in Sep. or later? In addition, the validity dealt with in <ref> [LDE + 84] </ref> is in essence the same with the effective validity of [CM84], provided that the event time and the logical time are for modeling of the same real-world validity.

They need to be separated. Lastly, unlike the previous view <ref> [LDE + 84, SA85] </ref>, combination of valid and transaction times cannot model retroactive and proactive updates. 3 Temporal validity In this section, we present the notions of temporal validity and sort of validity. With these notions, the validity problem partially discussed in the previous section can be clearly understood. <p> cannot record and retrieve all the past states, we will get to lose some past states, that is, the preservation of the past will be incomplete. [Sno87] is regarded as the first comprehensive treatment of the preservation of past states, although the aspect of retroactive update was mentioned earlier in <ref> [LDE + 84] </ref>. A common problem in their work is that they made use of the transaction time (the physical time) to deal with retroactive and proactive updates. <p> Especially, E l should not be misunderstood as an event of error-discovering. Such an event, bearing a different semantics, should have occurred somewhere between time points, 10 and 15. 22 Reference Time concept Representing sort of validity [CM84] Event any sort of validity Transaction registration-based validity <ref> [LDE + 84] </ref> Logical any sort of validity Physical none (reference time for logical time) [SA85] Valid any sort of validity Transaction in rollback DB registration-based validity Transaction in temporal DB none (reference time for valid time) User-defined any sort of validity registration-based validity discussed in section 2.

Reference-contexts: In our view, earlier attempts at clarifying various time concepts introduced for enriching the semantics of temporal databases have only added more confusion. Early on, Snodgrass and Ahn <ref> [SA85] </ref> proposed three time concepts, valid time, transaction time, and user-defined time, based on the classification of temporal databases into rollback databases, historical databases, and temporal databases. However, the confusion concerning time concepts still persists and leads to the following problems: 1. <p> The difference is that in [LDE + 84] they used an additional time to capture the semantics of retroactive and proactive updates. We will discuss this problem further in section 4. The valid time and transaction time proposed by Snodgrass and Ahn are also confusing <ref> [SA85] </ref>. They distinguished the two times based on the classification of temporal databases into rollback databases, historical databases, and temporal databases 1 . <p> In contrast, the transaction time in their temporal databases is the same with the physical time of [LDE + 84] in the sense that both times are used to model retroactive and proactive updates. Also, it is noticeable in <ref> [SA85] </ref> that the user-defined time was treated just as a data type requiring only input/output functions.

To summarize, we identify several problems with the previous approaches. First, we think there has been a dichotomous classification of time concepts, i.e., reality vs. representation (or real-world database. 5 vs. database-world) [SA85]. That dichotomy, together with the absence of a proper quantification of temporal validity, presumably misled us to the point that there are one genuine real-world validity and other possible database-world validities, if any, such as the registration-based validity. <p> Second, we can see that the problem of preserving multiple past states has been intermingled with the validity problem. They need to be separated. Lastly, unlike the previous view <ref> [LDE + 84, SA85] </ref>, combination of valid and transaction times cannot model retroactive and proactive updates. 3 Temporal validity In this section, we present the notions of temporal validity and sort of validity. With these notions, the validity problem partially discussed in the previous section can be clearly understood. <p> points, one in the valid time and the other in the transaction time are given, a single data value can be retrieved without losing past database states generated by error corrections and delayed updates. 4.3 Orthogonality of event time and transaction time It is interesting to see in previous work <ref> [SA85, Sno87] </ref> that the retroactive update and the delayed update have been treated in the same way; in other words, the two were not differentiated at all. In their work, the time a fact is generated and the time it is recorded are indistinguishable and represented by the transaction time. <p> The transaction time of [CM84] and that of <ref> [SA85] </ref> used in rollback databases represent the 8 As mentioned before, we regard all the events as being the same kind, such as events of promotion.

The definition of characteristic functions for that validity is perhaps the simplest. <p> If an application requires a multisort validity, that requirement can be easily fulfilled by providing multiple valid times in a temporal database system. On the other hand, the physical time and the transaction time of <ref> [SA85] </ref> used in their temporal databases do not represent a sort of validity by themselves. They act as a reference time for the valid (or logical) time to measure the time difference we discussed in this section.

If a temporal database system cannot record and retrieve all the past states, we will get to lose some past states, that is, the preservation of the past will be incomplete. <ref> [Sno87] </ref> is regarded as the first comprehensive treatment of the preservation of past states, although the aspect of retroactive update was mentioned earlier in [LDE + 84]. <p> points, one in the valid time and the other in the transaction time are given, a single data value can be retrieved without losing past database states generated by error corrections and delayed updates. 4.3 Orthogonality of event time and transaction time It is interesting to see in previous work <ref> [SA85, Sno87] </ref> that the retroactive update and the delayed update have been treated in the same way; in other words, the two were not differentiated at all. In their work, the time a fact is generated and the time it is recorded are indistinguishable and represented by the transaction time.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The temporal database which incorporates time concept into the conventional database has been investigated by many researchers over a decade <ref> [Soo91] </ref>. The most predominant direction of the previous research has been the extension of the relational data model to a temporal one and/or the extension of the relational query languages SQL and Quel to temporal versions. Work on this area includes [CT85, Ari86, Sno87, Gad88, NA89, Sar90, SS91].

In our view, earlier attempts at clarifying various time concepts introduced for enriching the semantics of temporal databases have only added more confusion.
