Reference-contexts: A more geometric point of view 4 is taken by Fulton [32]. Furthermore we mention Moreno [70]. These books are suffi-cient to understand the papers concerning the decoding of algebraic-geometric codes. A standard reference of algebraic geometry for mathematicians is Hartshorne [40]. Ab-hyankar <ref> [2] </ref> is written for engineers. For a deeper understanding of modular curves and their codes we mention the book of Tsfasman and Vladut [107]. For computational algebra, that is to say for Grobner bases and algorithms for computing them, we refer to Buchberger [10] and Cox, Little and O'Shea [14]. <p> errors, that is to say the set of zeros of the function (s) will contain the error positions. 3 Algebraic-geometric codes For this section we refer to the work of Goppa [33, 34, 35, 36, 37], the survey papers on AG codes in this special issue and many other references <ref> [2, 12, 32, 62, 63, 64, 70, 102, 107] </ref>. By a curve over a field F q we mean an affine or projective variety of dimension one, which is absolutely irreducible and non-singular and whose defining equations are (homogeneous) polynomials with coefficients in F q .

Reference-contexts: This algorithm corrects b (ffi 1)=4c errors. At the end of the eighties Justesen, Larsen, Elbrond Jensen, Havemose and Hoholdt [41, 48] found for algebraic-geometric codes on plane curves a generalization of the decoding algorithm of Arimoto <ref> [3] </ref> and Peterson [78] for RS codes. This algorithm finds an error-locator polynomial in two variables which has the error positions among its zeros. This was generalized to arbitrary curves by Skorobogatov and Vladut [100]. <p> We will discuss in the following the basic and modified algorithm for the code C (D; G) as presented in [48, 56, 100] and which are generalizations of the decoding algorithm of Arimoto-Peterson <ref> [3, 78] </ref> for RS codes. Under certain assumptions both algorithms find, for a received word y, a rational function f which is zero at all error positions. Such functions are called error-locator functions. <p> The total number of discrepancies is equal to the rank of the matrix of syndromes. Furthermore this matrix can be written as a triple product of matrices with the diagonal matrix in the middle and the entries of the error-vector e on the diagonal. See <ref> [3, 78] </ref>. Therefore the total number of discrepancies is at most equal to wt (e), the number of errors. Let y be a received word with error vector e which has at most (n r 1)=2 errors with respect to the code C r . <p> A classical example is the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry. In the history of the decoding of linear codes one sees this phenomenon already in the decoding of RS codes by Arimoto <ref> [3] </ref> and Peterson [78], and later by the decoding of algebraic-geometric codes by Justesen et al. [48], Krachkovskii [56] and Porter [79], and finally the algorithms of Ehrhard [22] and Feng-Rao [23].

Reference-contexts: This problem is NP hard. See [6] and also <ref> [4] </ref>. McEliece cryptosystem [68] is based on this fact. The problem as posed above has two parts. Firstly the preprocessing part done at a laboratory and a factory where for an appropriate code C a decoder A C is built and this is allowed to be time consuming. <p> All decoding algorithms for algebraic-geometric codes, which we will treat below, decode up to half the designed minimum distance and have complexity O (n 3 ) or less for n ! 1. Whether this is the case for all linear codes we pose as the following problem from <ref> [4] </ref> on decoding up to half the minimum distance (with preprocessing): Problem 2.3 Is there an algorithm A which has as input (C; y), where C is a linear code and y a word of the same length as C and as output a word A (C; y) in C fl

Reference-contexts: Another contribution by Feng, Wei, Rao and Tzeng [24, 25, 29], which resulted from decoding by majority voting, is that both the construction and the determination of the parameters of the codes can be done in an elementary way. The Berlekamp-Massey algorithm <ref> [5, 67] </ref> on linear recurring relations in one vari 3 able was generalized by Sakata [85, 86] to several variables, and will be called the algorithm of BMS. <p> This is called majority coset decoding. Problem 8.21 What is the relation between Ehrhard's decoding algorithm and majority voting ? Problem 8.22 Does majority voting correct more than b (ffi FR 1)=2c errors ? 41 9 Linear recurring relations in several variables The Berlekamp-Massey algorithm <ref> [5, 67] </ref> on linear recurring relations in one variable was generalized to two and several variables, respectively, by Sakata [85, 86], and will be called the algorithm of BMS. <p> See [50, 107]. For both problems not much is known. 11 Error-locator ideals and Grobner bases The solution of the key equation for cyclic and RS codes can be done by Euclid's algorithm [104] or by the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm <ref> [5, 67] </ref> for polynomials in one variable. The first algorithm has as output the greatest common divisor of two polynomials f and g, that is to say, a generator of the ideal generated by f and g. <p> Remark 12.10 It is not true that every linear code of minimum distance d has a b (d 1)=2c-error-correcting pair. An <ref> [n; n 4; 5] </ref> code has a 2-error-correcting pair if and only if it is an Extended Generalized RS code or, what is the same, an algebraic-geometric code on a curve of genus zero. See [76].

Reference-contexts: The third condition can now be rephrased by saying that there exists no polynomial g 2 V ALP OL (u) such that Deg (g) 2 . This set is called the delta set or the footprint <ref> [7] </ref> of F . It is seen from this that the word "minimal" in the term "minimal polynomial set" refers to the Degree's of the polynomials in the set F . <p> These can be easily calculated. It was mentioned in Section 2 that the error vector is determined when all syndromes are known. The following variation of the Discrete Fourier Transform method <ref> [7] </ref> gives an explicit formula. Proposition 10.2 Assume that that all coordinates of the points P l are non-zero.

Reference-contexts: Although the parameters of AG codes, for instance the Hermitian codes, are superior to those of RS codes, the decoding algorithms for the latter are much faster than the present algorithms for the former codes. We think that it is safe to wager with R. Blahut <ref> [8] </ref> on the second prediction which says that algebraic-geometric codes will be used in practice within 20 years. Acknowledgement We hope that all those who have contributed to the decoding of algebraic-geometric codes recognize their fair share in this survey.

Reference-contexts: Seconly the actual operating of the many copies of the decoder for consumers which should work very fast. So one considers the problem of minimum distance decoding with preprocessing. This problem also turns out to be hard. See <ref> [9] </ref>. Thus the decoding algorithms which we will treat below have a twofold application: error-correction and cryptology.

Reference-contexts: At the beginning of the eighties, Ihara [44], Tsfasman, Vladut and Zink [107, 108] proved the existence of curves over finite fields with many rational points, giving asymptotically good codes. A first attempt to decode algebraic-geometric codes was made by Driencourt <ref> [15] </ref> for codes on elliptic curves. This algorithm corrects b (ffi 1)=4c errors. At the end of the eighties Justesen, Larsen, Elbrond Jensen, Havemose and Hoholdt [41, 48] found for algebraic-geometric codes on plane curves a generalization of the decoding algorithm of Arimoto [3] and Peterson [78] for RS codes.

Reference-contexts: The basic algorithm A (F ) depends on a suitable divisor F and corrects b (ffi 1 fl)=2c errors. The modified algorithm of Skorobogatov and Vladut [100] depends on an increasing sequence of divisors F 1 F s , was extended by Duursma <ref> [16, 18] </ref> and corrects (ffi 1)=2 oe errors, where oe is the Clifford defect. Only in very special cases is oe equal to zero and for plane curves oe is roughly equal to fl=4. <p> It was shown that the modified algorithm does not always correct up to half the minimum distance, but the number of error patterns where the algorithm does not decode the error is relatively small <ref> [16, 47, 74] </ref>. 2 It was shown by Pellikaan [72] that a number of basic algorithms in parallel decodes (ffi 1)=2 errors when a technical condition involving the Jacobian of the curve is ful-filed. <p> This curve has been studied most often in papers on AG codes and their decoding <ref> [16, 18, 25, 38, 43, 63, 81, 98] </ref>. In these papers however one considers codes of the form C (D; G), where D = P 1 + +P 21 and G = m (R 1 + R 2 + R 3 ). <p> Notice that the assumption deg (G F ) &gt; 2fl 2 + t implies that (G F Q) = 0 for every divisor Q of t error positions. The following lemma gives a weakening of the assumptions for the basic algorithm. See <ref> [16, 18, 21] </ref>. Lemma 4.5 Let H be a parity check matrix of the code C (D; G). Let y be a received word. <p> The modified algorithm was extended in <ref> [16, 18] </ref> by means of the following definition. Definition 4.12 The Clifford defect oe (E) of a divisor E such that 0 deg (E) 2fl 2 is defined by oe (E) = 2 Remark 4.13 It follows from Clifford's Theorem that oe (E) is not negative. <p> In this way the following theorem is obtained. See <ref> [16, 18] </ref>. Theorem 4.14 The extended modified algorithm corrects (ffi 1)=2 oe i (E) errors, where i = 0 when the Goppa designed minimum distance is odd and i = 1 otherwise. The complexity of the algorithm is at most O (n 3 ). <p> Remark 4.15 Only curves of genus 0 and (hyper)elliptic curves have the property that there exists a divisor H such that oe (H) = 0 or oe (E) = 0. The Clifford defect is computed for several curves <ref> [16, 52] </ref> and is about fl=4 for plane curves. <p> is an element of C L (Q; 11P ) we have that e fl C L (Q; 11P ) " C (12P; Q) 6= 0, which means that the kernel K (e; 11P ) contains functions which are not error locators by Proposition 4.7. 25 Example 4.19 We refer to <ref> [16, 18] </ref> for a worked out example of a Hermitian code where the number of decoding failures of the modified algoritithm is computed. <p> Problem 4.20 What is the number of correctable error patterns when the basic and modified algorithm is used ? A start has been made to investigate this question <ref> [16, 18, 47, 74] </ref>, but a thorough investigation is still lacking. 5 Decoding and the Jacobian of a curve We give an upper bound for the number s of divisors F 1 ; : : : ; F s which are needed in order that for each received word y, with <p> Furthermore s = O (n) and the complexity of the algorithm is O (n 4 ) for n ! 1.

Reference-contexts: An elegant solution of the decoding problem for algebraic-geometric codes by a majority vote for unknown syndromes was proposed by Feng and Rao [23]. They showed in collaboration with Duursma <ref> [17, 18] </ref> that the algorithm corrects (ffi 1)=2 errors. The origin of these methods stems from the decoding of cyclic codes beyond the BCH error-correcting capacity by Feng and Tzeng [28]. <p> It looks like a difficult (possibly hopeless) problem in general, which is, moreover, obsolete from the decoding point of view, given the solutions of the decoding problem <ref> [17, 22, 23] </ref> which we will discuss in Sections 7 and 8. Example 5.7 The zeta function of the Klein quartic over F 8 is equal to (1 + 5T + 8T 2 ) 3 so its Jacobian has 14 3 elements. <p> This is done in such a way that the unknown syndromes s i (e) = h i e T i &gt; n k can be obtained recursively from known syndromes s i (e) = s i (y); 1 i n k by a majority vote. See <ref> [23, 17, 18] </ref> and also [53, 75]. This procedure has its predecessor in what is called threshold, majority logic [66] or sequential code reduction decoding [82] and the decoding of cyclic codes beyond the BCH error-correcting capacity [28]. <p> In this way all unknown syndromes can be found by induction and from this the error vector is obtained, as was remarked in Section 2. Thus the proof of the following theorem from <ref> [17, 18, 23] </ref> has been sketched. See also [53, 75]. Theorem 8.10 Majority voting for unknown syndromes corrects b (ffi F R 1)=2c errors with complexity O (n 3 ). <p> Coset decoding is applied to Hermitian codes in [112]. A different but equivalent point of view with respect to majority voting for syndromes is taken in <ref> [17, 18] </ref>, where the computation of y 0 is done by a majority vote. This is called majority coset decoding.

A start has been made to investigate this question <ref> [16, 18, 47, 74] </ref>, but a thorough investigation is still lacking. 5 Decoding and the Jacobian of a curve We give an upper bound for the number s of divisors F 1 ; : : : ; F s which are needed in order that for each received word y, with <p> Remark 7.1 It is shown in [20, 21] that K (F ) = K 0 (F ) when F has support disjoint from the support of D and deg (F ) &gt; maxfdeg (G 0 ); deg (G D)g. It was noted in <ref> [18] </ref> that one can always work with K (F ) instead of K 0 (F ), see also Remark 4:4. We denote the dimension of K (F ) by k (F ). <p> Output: ? 6. e := res D ((f j y )=f ) for some non-zero f 2 K (F j ) 7. Output: y e An alternative of the above algorithm is to apply the basic algorithm A (F j ) at line 6. See <ref> [18] </ref>. We quote the following proposition from [22]. 32 Theorem 7.6 Let X be a curve of genus fl, and C = C (D; G) an algebraic-geometric code of Goppa designed minimum distance ffi 6fl. <p> Then B (F ) is a decoder for C which corrects t errors with complexity O (n 3 ). Remark 7.7 Using Clifford's Theorem one can show that the assumption "ffi 6fl" can be replaced by the weaker condition "ffi 4fl". See <ref> [18] </ref>. Remark 7.8 If one applies both the algorithms B (F ) and B (G F ) for a divisor F such that deg (F ) = fl + t, then it is enough to assume that ffi 4fl 2o , where o is the gonality of the curve. See [18]. <p> <ref> [18] </ref>. Remark 7.8 If one applies both the algorithms B (F ) and B (G F ) for a divisor F such that deg (F ) = fl + t, then it is enough to assume that ffi 4fl 2o , where o is the gonality of the curve. See [18]. Moreover it is shown in an example that this cannot be improved. <p> This is done in such a way that the unknown syndromes s i (e) = h i e T i &gt; n k can be obtained recursively from known syndromes s i (e) = s i (y); 1 i n k by a majority vote. See <ref> [23, 17, 18] </ref> and also [53, 75]. This procedure has its predecessor in what is called threshold, majority logic [66] or sequential code reduction decoding [82] and the decoding of cyclic codes beyond the BCH error-correcting capacity [28]. <p> In this way all unknown syndromes can be found by induction and from this the error vector is obtained, as was remarked in Section 2. Thus the proof of the following theorem from <ref> [17, 18, 23] </ref> has been sketched. See also [53, 75]. Theorem 8.10 Majority voting for unknown syndromes corrects b (ffi F R 1)=2c errors with complexity O (n 3 ). <p> Thus in the next steps the voting is unanimous. Remark 8.15 In order to give an example where the modified algorithms fails and the majority voting succeeds and is not unanimous we need to look at codes on a curve of higher genus such as the Hermitian curve <ref> [23, 18, 57] </ref>. Remark 8.16 The Fundamental Iterative Algorithm [27] and the Modified Fundamental Iterative Algorithm [23] are generalizations of Gaussian elimination for a partial matrix to get the unknown syndromes. <p> Coset decoding is applied to Hermitian codes in [112]. A different but equivalent point of view with respect to majority voting for syndromes is taken in <ref> [17, 18] </ref>, where the computation of y 0 is done by a majority vote. This is called majority coset decoding.

Another contribution by Feng, Wei, Rao and Tzeng <ref> [24, 25, 29] </ref>, which resulted from decoding by majority voting, is that both the construction and the determination of the parameters of the codes can be done in an elementary way. <p> Using the block-Hankel structure of codes on plane curves, Feng, Wei, Rao and Tzeng <ref> [29] </ref> could lower the complexity of the majority voting scheme too. The error-locator ideal was determined by Saints and Heegard [83, 84] and Leonard [60] with the algorithm of BMS. <p> A more efficient stop criterion is treated in [105]. Remark 8.18 We have seen that the decoding by majority voting gave a new bound for geometric Goppa codes and this is the basis of an elementary treatment of these codes in <ref> [24, 25, 29] </ref>. Remark 8.19 The majority voting scheme is also incorporated in Porter's algorithm [97]. See also the treatment of an example with an Hermitian code. Remark 8.20 Suppose that C 0 is a subcode of C and that we have a decoding algorithm for C 0 . <p> If one uses the special structure of the syndrome matrix, the complexity of the decoding can be improved. This is done in <ref> [29] </ref>, using the block-Hankel structure. The algorithm of BMS is used to get fast implementations of, the modified algorithm in [49] and [45, 46], Porter's algorithm in [96], and the majority voting scheme in [49, 65, 89, 90, 91].

Reference-contexts: The ring K 1 (P ) is not a Euclidean ring whenever the genus is not zero. The sequence of solutions in the Euclidean algorithm is replaced by an algorithm giving the so called subresultant sequence. See <ref> [30, 79, 94, 96] </ref>. <p> The complexity of Buchberger's algorithm is not polynomial. The algorithm of BMS gives as output a minimal polynomial set, and in the intermediate steps the sets are Grobner bases of the ideals they generate, but these ideals vary. The algorithm of BMS has polynomial complexity. Remark 11.4 In <ref> [30] </ref> another method for solving the same problem as the algorithm of BMS is developed. It is a variation of the Grobner basis algorithm and has therefore in general higher complexity.

Reference-contexts: We will not survey these papers and only mention that as a result one now has soft-decision decoding algorithms for AG codes, by combining these extensions with the generalized minimum distance algorithm of Forney <ref> [31] </ref>. Some specific examples on the Klein curve are examined in detail. These examples are primarily chosen from a didactical point of view and not because the codes are good. We want to illustrate the concepts and properties, and compare the distinct algorithms in these examples.

Under certain assumptions both algorithms find, for a received word y, a rational function f which is zero at all error positions. Such functions are called error-locator functions. <p> The error values can be computed by solving a linear system of n k equations in at most ffi 1 unknowns. Thus we have sketched the proof of the following proposition. See <ref> [48, 56, 100] </ref>. Theorem 4.2 The basic algorithm corrects b (ffi 1 fl)=2c errors.

Remark 4.3 The Goppa designed minimum distance is negative for functional codes C L (D; G) with deg (G) &gt; deg (D) = n. <p> The complexity of the algorithm is at most O (n 3 ). Remark 4.11 The number s (H) is about fl=4 for plane curves. In the original decoding algorithm <ref> [48] </ref> the codes were defined on affine plane curves and were of the form C (D; jH), where H is the intersection divisor of the curve with the line at infinity. <p> See [42, 43]. 6 The key equation Around the same time that the paper <ref> [48] </ref> on the decoding algorithm for plane curves was published, Porter [79] found another decoding algorithm which was a generalization of solving the key equation of classical Goppa codes by Euclid's algorithm in the 28 ring of polynomials in one variable [104]. <p> A classical example is the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry. In the history of the decoding of linear codes one sees this phenomenon already in the decoding of RS codes by Arimoto [3] and Peterson [78], and later by the decoding of algebraic-geometric codes by Justesen et al. <ref> [48] </ref>, Krachkovskii [56] and Porter [79], and finally the algorithms of Ehrhard [22] and Feng-Rao [23].

In this section an outline of the algorithm is given. <p> This algorithm was subsequently used to get fast implementations of the modified algorithm in [49] and [45, 46], of Porter's algorithm in [96] and the majority voting scheme in <ref> [49, 65, 89, 90, 91] </ref>. In this section an outline of the algorithm is given. The algorithm takes as input an N -dimensional array of elements of a field F and produces as output a so-called minimal set of polynomials corresponding to linear recurring relations satisfied by the array. <p> If one uses the special structure of the syndrome matrix, the complexity of the decoding can be improved. This is done in [29], using the block-Hankel structure. The algorithm of BMS is used to get fast implementations of, the modified algorithm in <ref> [49] </ref> and [45, 46], Porter's algorithm in [96], and the majority voting scheme in [49, 65, 89, 90, 91].

Reference-contexts: As a result of the majority voting it was noticed that sometimes one can even correct beyond half the Goppa designed minimum distance [24]. This was formalized by Kirfel and Pellikaan <ref> [53] </ref> who introduced the Feng-Rao designed minimum distance ffi F R for one point codes C (D; mP ), which is determined by the semigroup of non-gaps of the point P . Shen and Tzeng [97] applied the majority voting scheme to Porter's algorithm. <p> See [23, 17, 18] and also <ref> [53, 75] </ref>. This procedure has its predecessor in what is called threshold, majority logic [66] or sequential code reduction decoding [82] and the decoding of cyclic codes beyond the BCH error-correcting capacity [28]. <p> See <ref> [53, 75] </ref>. Remark 8.3 One has that ffi F R ffi and equality holds if r &gt; 3fl 2. Note that the definition of ffi F R depends only on the semigroup of non-gaps of P . <p> Note that the definition of ffi F R depends only on the semigroup of non-gaps of P . It has been computed for semigroups with two generators and more generally for telescopic semigroups <ref> [53] </ref>. In many examples ffi F R is strictly greater than ffi for small r. Example 8.4 The non-gap sequence at the point P of the Suzuki curve of Example 3:8 is generated by 8; 10; 12 and 13. <p> In this way all unknown syndromes can be found by induction and from this the error vector is obtained, as was remarked in Section 2. Thus the proof of the following theorem from [17, 18, 23] has been sketched. See also <ref> [53, 75] </ref>. Theorem 8.10 Majority voting for unknown syndromes corrects b (ffi F R 1)=2c errors with complexity O (n 3 ). <p> See [76]. Remark 12.11 Error-correcting pairs have been found for many cyclic codes to decode beyond the BCH error-correcting capacity [19]. Majority voting for unkown syndromes has been generalized for arbitrary linear codes as well, with the notion of an error-correcting array. See <ref> [53, 75] </ref>. The most general scheme for getting bounds on the minimum distance and decoding up to half this bound is found in the notion of the shift bound. See [77, 98, 99].

Reference-contexts: The basic algorithm can be phrased in terms of arbitrary linear codes by the notion of an error-correcting pair of Pellikaan [71, 74, 76], later independently found by Kotter <ref> [54] </ref>. This has been applied to decode cyclic codes beyond their BCH error-correcting capacity by Duursma and Kotter [19]. <p> The same kind of reasoning was published in <ref> [54] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: With the basic algorithm Skorobogatov and Vladut gave an algorithm to correct errors-and-erasures up to ffi fl. Several authors <ref> [26, 55, 88, 99] </ref> have papers in preparation which deal with the extension of the various decoding algorithms to error-and-erasure correction.

Reference-contexts: This algorithm finds an error-locator polynomial in two variables which has the error positions among its zeros. This was generalized to arbitrary curves by Skorobogatov and Vladut [100]. Independently Krachkovskii proved the same result, but his work was only published as a conference paper in Russian <ref> [56] </ref>. In this way one gets the basic and modified decoding algorithm [100, 107]. The basic algorithm A (F ) depends on a suitable divisor F and corrects b (ffi 1 fl)=2c errors. <p> We will discuss in the following the basic and modified algorithm for the code C (D; G) as presented in <ref> [48, 56, 100] </ref> and which are generalizations of the decoding algorithm of Arimoto-Peterson [3, 78] for RS codes. Under certain assumptions both algorithms find, for a received word y, a rational function f which is zero at all error positions. Such functions are called error-locator functions. <p> The error values can be computed by solving a linear system of n k equations in at most ffi 1 unknowns. Thus we have sketched the proof of the following proposition. See <ref> [48, 56, 100] </ref>. Theorem 4.2 The basic algorithm corrects b (ffi 1 fl)=2c errors. The complexity of the algorithm is at most O (n 3 ). Remark 4.3 The Goppa designed minimum distance is negative for functional codes C L (D; G) with deg (G) &gt; deg (D) = n. <p> A classical example is the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry. In the history of the decoding of linear codes one sees this phenomenon already in the decoding of RS codes by Arimoto [3] and Peterson [78], and later by the decoding of algebraic-geometric codes by Justesen et al. [48], Krachkovskii <ref> [56] </ref> and Porter [79], and finally the algorithms of Ehrhard [22] and Feng-Rao [23].

Reference-contexts: Thus in the next steps the voting is unanimous. Remark 8.15 In order to give an example where the modified algorithms fails and the majority voting succeeds and is not unanimous we need to look at codes on a curve of higher genus such as the Hermitian curve <ref> [23, 18, 57] </ref>. Remark 8.16 The Fundamental Iterative Algorithm [27] and the Modified Fundamental Iterative Algorithm [23] are generalizations of Gaussian elimination for a partial matrix to get the unknown syndromes.

Reference-contexts: Using the block-Hankel structure of codes on plane curves, Feng, Wei, Rao and Tzeng [29] could lower the complexity of the majority voting scheme too. The error-locator ideal was determined by Saints and Heegard [83, 84] and Leonard <ref> [60] </ref> with the algorithm of BMS. The former authors enlarged the notion of algebraic-geometric codes in such a way that it gives a unified treatment of (multi)cyclic, Hyperbolic Cascaded Reed Solomon, Reed-Muller and AG codes. <p> In these papers however one considers codes of the form C (D; G), where D = P 1 + +P 21 and G = m (R 1 + R 2 + R 3 ). In <ref> [60, 61] </ref> and the following decoding algorithms the codes C (m) are used as an example. <p> Alternatively, it is possible to use the algorithm of BMS (with majority voting) to get a Grobner basis for the ideal of error-locators. From this it is then possible to find the error positions and then the error-magnitudes. This approach was used in <ref> [60, 83, 84] </ref>, see Section 11. <p> The paper also relates the calculation of the ideal of error locators to general Grobner basis techniques, since in the decoding situation the algorithm of BMS indeed gives a Grobner basis. In <ref> [60, 61] </ref> Grobner basis theory is also applied to give a basis for the ideal of error locators with respect to a (weighted) total degree lexicographic order.

Reference-contexts: The former authors enlarged the notion of algebraic-geometric codes in such a way that it gives a unified treatment of (multi)cyclic, Hyperbolic Cascaded Reed Solomon, Reed-Muller and AG codes. The latter author <ref> [61] </ref> used a change of an admissible order on the monomials to get a generalization of Forney's algorithm for the error values. <p> In these papers however one considers codes of the form C (D; G), where D = P 1 + +P 21 and G = m (R 1 + R 2 + R 3 ). In <ref> [60, 61] </ref> and the following decoding algorithms the codes C (m) are used as an example. <p> 2 g 5 = g 2 2 ; g 3j2 = g j 2 and g 3j = g 3 g j1 From the affine equation of the Klein quartic follows g 4 and there is another equation which is more difficult to find g 3 5 = 0: See <ref> [61] </ref>. <p> If we consider the 3-error pattern from <ref> [61] </ref> where Q 1 = (1; ), Q 2 = ( 2 ; 1) and Q 3 = (; 1), and the corresponding error values are 1, 3 and , then it turns out that K (y; 3P ) = K (y; 5P ) = 0 but K (y; 6P ) <p> Thus the proof of the following theorem from [17, 18, 23] has been sketched. See also [53, 75]. Theorem 8.10 Majority voting for unknown syndromes corrects b (ffi F R 1)=2c errors with complexity O (n 3 ). Example 8.11 Consider the following error pattern from <ref> [61] </ref> for the code C (11) on the Klein quartic with error positions Q 1 = (1; ), Q 2 = ( 2 ; 1) and Q 3 = (; 1) and error values e 1 = 1, e 2 = 3 and e 3 = . <p> The corresponding functions are y, xy and x 2 y; and these will be denoted by the variables Z 1 , Z 2 and Z 3 , respectively. For the code C (11) we consider the 3-error pattern from <ref> [61] </ref> where Q 1 = (1; ), Q 2 = ( 2 ; 1) and Q 3 = (; 1) and the corresponding error values are 1, 3 and , respectively. <p> The paper also relates the calculation of the ideal of error locators to general Grobner basis techniques, since in the decoding situation the algorithm of BMS indeed gives a Grobner basis. In <ref> [60, 61] </ref> Grobner basis theory is also applied to give a basis for the ideal of error locators with respect to a (weighted) total degree lexicographic order. <p> In [60, 61] Grobner basis theory is also applied to give a basis for the ideal of error locators with respect to a (weighted) total degree lexicographic order. Moreover <ref> [61] </ref> produces a second Grobner basis with respect to a lexicographic order and this is subsequently used to give a generalized Forney formula for the error values. An analysis of the complexity of this formula and a comparison with the Discrete Fourier Transform method remains to be done.

Reference-contexts: Another contribution by Feng, Wei, Rao and Tzeng [24, 25, 29], which resulted from decoding by majority voting, is that both the construction and the determination of the parameters of the codes can be done in an elementary way.

Reference-contexts: It was shown that the modified algorithm does not always correct up to half the minimum distance, but the number of error patterns where the algorithm does not decode the error is relatively small [16, 47, 74]. 2 It was shown by Pellikaan <ref> [72] </ref> that a number of basic algorithms in parallel decodes (ffi 1)=2 errors when a technical condition involving the Jacobian of the curve is ful-filed. <p> Remark 4.8 If we take for the basic algorithm a special divisor F and assume l (F ) &gt; t, instead of deg (F ) t + fl, and moreover deg (G F ) &gt; 2fl 2 + t, then t (ffi 1)=3. See <ref> [72] </ref>. Another way to improve the basic algorithm is to apply it with a sequence of divisors F 1 ; : : : ; F s . <p> See <ref> [72, 109] </ref>. We consider the decoding of codes of the form C (D; G). Assume deg (G) &gt; 2fl 2. Let t = b (ffi 1)=2c. Suppose that ffi is odd for simplicity. <p> Thus there exists an i such that (G F i Q) = 0, and therefore A (F i ) corrects the errors of y. We have sketched the proof from <ref> [72] </ref> of the following proposition. Proposition 5.1 Let (F 1 ; : : : ; F s ) be an s-tuple of effective divisors of degree t+fl such that s t+fl (F 1 ; : : : ; F s ) is not in the image of s fl1 . <p> The number of elements of J (X ) is equal to P (1). With the help of these properties of the zeta function it was shown that 2fl is not surjective for all maximal curves <ref> [72] </ref>, for all curves when q 37, and for all curves of genus fl fl 0 (q) when q 16 [109]. <p> Furthermore s = O (n) and the complexity of the algorithm is O (n 4 ) for n ! 1. Remark 5.3 In [16, 21] it was shown that the condition deg (G) 4fl 2 in <ref> [72] </ref> could be replaced by deg (G) &gt; 2fl 2.

Reference-contexts: This algorithm corrects b (ffi 1)=4c errors. At the end of the eighties Justesen, Larsen, Elbrond Jensen, Havemose and Hoholdt [41, 48] found for algebraic-geometric codes on plane curves a generalization of the decoding algorithm of Arimoto [3] and Peterson <ref> [78] </ref> for RS codes. This algorithm finds an error-locator polynomial in two variables which has the error positions among its zeros. This was generalized to arbitrary curves by Skorobogatov and Vladut [100]. <p> We will discuss in the following the basic and modified algorithm for the code C (D; G) as presented in [48, 56, 100] and which are generalizations of the decoding algorithm of Arimoto-Peterson <ref> [3, 78] </ref> for RS codes. Under certain assumptions both algorithms find, for a received word y, a rational function f which is zero at all error positions. Such functions are called error-locator functions. <p> The total number of discrepancies is equal to the rank of the matrix of syndromes. Furthermore this matrix can be written as a triple product of matrices with the diagonal matrix in the middle and the entries of the error-vector e on the diagonal. See <ref> [3, 78] </ref>. Therefore the total number of discrepancies is at most equal to wt (e), the number of errors. Let y be a received word with error vector e which has at most (n r 1)=2 errors with respect to the code C r . <p> A classical example is the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry. In the history of the decoding of linear codes one sees this phenomenon already in the decoding of RS codes by Arimoto [3] and Peterson <ref> [78] </ref>, and later by the decoding of algebraic-geometric codes by Justesen et al. [48], Krachkovskii [56] and Porter [79], and finally the algorithms of Ehrhard [22] and Feng-Rao [23].

Under certain assumptions both algorithms find, for a received word y, a rational function f which is zero at all error positions. Such functions are called error-locator functions. <p> The error values can be computed by solving a linear system of n k equations in at most ffi 1 unknowns. Thus we have sketched the proof of the following proposition. See <ref> [48, 56, 100] </ref>. Theorem 4.2 The basic algorithm corrects b (ffi 1 fl)=2c errors.

In the modified algorithm <ref> [100] </ref> consider a sequence of divisors F 1 F s G and take a non-zero function of K (y; F i ) for the smallest value of i such that the corresponding kernel is not zero, and continue as in the basic algorithm for F i . <p> Definition 4.9 Let m be the degree of H.

Reference-contexts: As a reference on coding theory we use MacWilliams and Sloane [69]. There are some introductory works on the algebraic-geometric codes. See [37, 62, 63, 64]. For a self-contained treatment on algebraic curves over finite fields we recommend the books of Chevalley [12] and Stichtenoth <ref> [102] </ref> which treat curves from the algebraic point of view, that is to say by function fields of one variable. A more geometric point of view 4 is taken by Fulton [32]. Furthermore we mention Moreno [70]. <p> errors, that is to say the set of zeros of the function (s) will contain the error positions. 3 Algebraic-geometric codes For this section we refer to the work of Goppa [33, 34, 35, 36, 37], the survey papers on AG codes in this special issue and many other references <ref> [2, 12, 32, 62, 63, 64, 70, 102, 107] </ref>. By a curve over a field F q we mean an affine or projective variety of dimension one, which is absolutely irreducible and non-singular and whose defining equations are (homogeneous) polynomials with coefficients in F q .

Reference-contexts: Remark 10.10 The general problem of solving linear equations can be done faster than Gaussian elimination. Its complexity can be reduced from O (n 3 ) to O (n 2:38 ), where n is the number of variables. See <ref> [92, 103] </ref> for survey papers on this topic.

Reference-contexts: In his thesis Porter [79] gave another decoding algorithm generalizing the solution of the key equation with Euclid's algorithm by Sugiyama, Kasahara, Hirasawa and Namekawa <ref> [104] </ref>. The correctness of the algorithm and the fact that it decodes (ffi 1)=2 oe errors was shown in a paper of Porter, Shen and Pellikaan [79, 80] and by Ehrhard [20, 21]. The latter proved moreover that the modified algorithm and Porter's algorithm are equivalent. <p> key equation Around the same time that the paper [48] on the decoding algorithm for plane curves was published, Porter [79] found another decoding algorithm which was a generalization of solving the key equation of classical Goppa codes by Euclid's algorithm in the 28 ring of polynomials in one variable <ref> [104] </ref>. The correctness of the proposed algorithm was proved in [20, 21, 80, 94, 95, 96]. One can view the ring of polynomials in one variable as the ring of rational functions on the projective line with only poles at the point at infinity. <p> See [51]. As a start one needs to know the weight enumerator of the code. See [50, 107]. For both problems not much is known. 11 Error-locator ideals and Grobner bases The solution of the key equation for cyclic and RS codes can be done by Euclid's algorithm <ref> [104] </ref> or by the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm [5, 67] for polynomials in one variable. The first algorithm has as output the greatest common divisor of two polynomials f and g, that is to say, a generator of the ideal generated by f and g.

Reference-contexts: A more efficient stop criterion is treated in <ref> [105] </ref>. Remark 8.18 We have seen that the decoding by majority voting gave a new bound for geometric Goppa codes and this is the basis of an elementary treatment of these codes in [24, 25, 29]. Remark 8.19 The majority voting scheme is also incorporated in Porter's algorithm [97].

Reference-contexts: If the genus is zero, the curve is just the projective line, the functional codes are extended Reed-Solomon codes, and the differential codes classical Goppa codes. At the beginning of the eighties, Ihara [44], Tsfasman, Vladut and Zink <ref> [107, 108] </ref> proved the existence of curves over finite fields with many rational points, giving asymptotically good codes. A first attempt to decode algebraic-geometric codes was made by Driencourt [15] for codes on elliptic curves. This algorithm corrects b (ffi 1)=4c errors. <p> This was generalized to arbitrary curves by Skorobogatov and Vladut [100]. Independently Krachkovskii proved the same result, but his work was only published as a conference paper in Russian [56]. In this way one gets the basic and modified decoding algorithm <ref> [100, 107] </ref>. The basic algorithm A (F ) depends on a suitable divisor F and corrects b (ffi 1 fl)=2c errors. <p> These books are suffi-cient to understand the papers concerning the decoding of algebraic-geometric codes. A standard reference of algebraic geometry for mathematicians is Hartshorne [40]. Ab-hyankar [2] is written for engineers. For a deeper understanding of modular curves and their codes we mention the book of Tsfasman and Vladut <ref> [107] </ref>. For computational algebra, that is to say for Grobner bases and algorithms for computing them, we refer to Buchberger [10] and Cox, Little and O'Shea [14]. Notation F denotes a field, F q denotes the finite field with q elements. <p> errors, that is to say the set of zeros of the function (s) will contain the error positions. 3 Algebraic-geometric codes For this section we refer to the work of Goppa [33, 34, 35, 36, 37], the survey papers on AG codes in this special issue and many other references <ref> [2, 12, 32, 62, 63, 64, 70, 102, 107] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The existence of a sequence of divisors F 1 ; : : : ; F s on a maximal curve is proved such that at least one of the basic algorithms A (F i ) corrects a received word. The argument was generalized by Vladut <ref> [109] </ref> for almost all curves. The smallest value for s was studied by Carbonne, Henocq, Rotillon and Thiong-Ly [11, 42, 43]. <p> See <ref> [72, 109] </ref>. We consider the decoding of codes of the form C (D; G). Assume deg (G) &gt; 2fl 2. Let t = b (ffi 1)=2c. Suppose that ffi is odd for simplicity. <p> With the help of these properties of the zeta function it was shown that 2fl is not surjective for all maximal curves [72], for all curves when q 37, and for all curves of genus fl fl 0 (q) when q 16 <ref> [109] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The curve in affine 3-space over F q , q = r 2 , defined by the Kummer extensions: Y r+1 = X r + X; has (q 1) 2 rational points and genus r 3 + r 2 3. See <ref> [110] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It was considered quite an esoteric subject, nice for research but of no practical importance. This has dramatically changed after the development of chip technology and fast decoding algorithms, the application to the compact disc player and the error-correction in deep space information transmission. See <ref> [111] </ref>. One might hope that the attitude towards algebraic-geometric codes, which 55 is considered to be a difficult and remote topic nowadays, will change too for the better in the future. At the moment there are two conflicting predictions concerning the practical use of algebraic-geometric codes.

Reference-contexts: Hermitian codes are codes of the form C L (P 1 + + P n ; mP ). See <ref> [41, 48, 64, 65, 95, 96, 101, 106, 112] </ref>. <p> A coset decoding algorithm has as input a received word y with error vector e with respect to C and gives as output a word y 0 which has the same coset as e with respect to C 0 . Coset decoding is applied to Hermitian codes in <ref> [112] </ref>. A different but equivalent point of view with respect to majority voting for syndromes is taken in [17, 18], where the computation of y 0 is done by a majority vote. This is called majority coset decoding.
