Abstract: One of the main objectives of the OSISIM project (Open Systems Integrated Simulator) is to define a methodology that allows to model, in a generic way, mechanisms, services and protocols related to communication systems. Indeed, this paper describes a methodology based on the concept of function, as defined in the OSI RM, for simulation modeling of transfer protocols. This methodology has two main advantages : tailoring a protocol entity to provide a required service and improving the productivity during the modeling phase. Each function is structured as a module and stored in a library of functions. It is related to the other functions by means of two graph types, precedence graphs and presence of functions in a protocol is captured. In the last section of this paper, the methodology is applied to model Xpress Transfer Protocol.

Reference-contexts: Each function can be separately developed, verified, implemented and maintained. Our approach is based on functional decomposition, also pursued in many other projects, specially to design the new generation of high speed transport protocols for high speed communication systems <ref> [3, 4, 5, 6] </ref>. Generally, this approach is used to take into account the intrinsic parallelism inside protocols in order to implement high speed transport protocols in VLSI chips and/or in parallel computers. <p> These two equivalent concepts are used in our methodology. Actually, a protocol entity model can be built from functions stored in a Library called LoF, for Library of Functions. Functions are classified in different ways. For Clark and Tennenhouse in <ref> [3 ] </ref> , a distinction which seems to have great relevance is the separation of data transfer functions into two groups: those which actually read or modify the data, and are called data manipulation and those functions that regulate the transfer, and are called transfer control.

The integration of functions into one layer is proposed in HOPS (Horizontally Oriented Protocol Structure) model of Hass <ref> [4 ] </ref> . HOPS features a single protocol that provides all functions at and above the transport level. Flexibility is achieved by selective functionality: the modeler can select from a predefined set of options, the functions required on a per-session basis.

The pipeline category contains the synchronous data-dependent functions, e.g., routing and segmenting in the network layer. Segmenting can only be performed if the routing decision is finished.

Performance is enhanced because the functions are horizontally composed, rather than vertically. In <ref> [6] </ref>, Zitterbart introduces the concept of protocol machine pool, which is the same concept of protocol with menu introduced by Hass. These two equivalent concepts are used in our methodology. Actually, a protocol entity model can be built from functions stored in a Library called LoF, for Library of Functions.

Reference-contexts: The term service is heavily overloaded in communications and carries different meanings in different contexts. In our context, a service is considered as a set of functions <ref> [7 ] </ref> . These functions have to be included in a protocol entity pattern in order to provide the required service. Furthermore, the modeler may pre-define a certain number of services. Each predefined service is associated with a subset of functions, where each function is chosen with one algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the modeler may pre-define a certain number of services. Each predefined service is associated with a subset of functions, where each function is chosen with one algorithm. A Pattern Protocol Determination Process (PPDP) <ref> [8 ] </ref> is used to construct a pattern of a protocol entity from LoF. PPDP uses, on one side, the precedence graphs and the - graph defined for the available functions into LoF, and on the other side, a set of selected functions and/or a pre defined service.

Reference-contexts: It may happen that more than one pattern can provide the required service because functions may have more than one algorithm. At the opposite, it may happen that no pattern can be determined, which is able to fulfill all the requirements. 7. Application to XTP XTP <ref> [9 ] </ref> is one of the most promising full-featured lightweight transfer protocol provides the functionalities of Network Layer and Transport Layer. XTP can provide a full range of services needed to support distributed systems. The features of XTP includes rate control, selective retransmission, no-error mode, etc.
