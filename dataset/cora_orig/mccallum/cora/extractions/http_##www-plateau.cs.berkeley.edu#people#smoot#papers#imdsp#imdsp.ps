However, this can be replaced by modeling the distribution for each coefficient and making a simple model-based calculation. This results in an up to 25% speedup in the RD-OPT code from <ref> [4] </ref>. Because using the model reduces the accuracy of the predictions, it is best employed for rapid exploration of the data. 5. CONCLUSIONS A simple model for the distribution of AC DCT terms can result in efficiency increases in both dequantization and optimal quantization matrix generation.
