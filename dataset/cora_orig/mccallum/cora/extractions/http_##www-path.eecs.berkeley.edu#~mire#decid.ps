Theorem 1 Let T be a timed automaton with n clocks. There exists a finite automaton U which is a bisimulation for T . Finally, we define a class of initialized timed automata called PN (positive/negative) timed automata.

Reference-contexts: The main result for the outer reach set approximation is that under certain conditions, as * goes to zero, the outer reach set approximation will approach the original reach set. The necessary conditions and result are summarized in the following theorem, whose proof can be found in <ref> [14] </ref>. Theorem 9 Assume that the enabling regions are closed, the initial region X 0 is compact, and there are at most a finite number of steps over a finite time interval.
