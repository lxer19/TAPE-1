Abstract: is approximately the same may suggest that except for the overall brightness, the scrambled images of certain image classes 2 look visually similar and, in particular, the lowpass images of those scrambled images can be used interchangeably. Therefore, unlike in the previous scheme in which the lowpass image is sent together with channel coefficients, in this scheme, only the overall brightness of the input image is put together with channel coefficients. At the receiver end, the channel coefficients of each received packet go through their corresponding synthesis channels. The output of the synthesis bank is then added to a pre-set lowpass image, scaled by the overall brightness of the input image. Our pre-set lowpass image is generated from Lena. Lastly, the image is "unscrambled" by the unscrambler to give the final output image. We performed experiments on 9 images (see Footnote 2). Figure 1 shows results obtained for the Barbara image of size 512fi512. Our filter bank has 64 subbands which are divided into 8 packets (thus each packet is of size 32KB). We experimented with 12:5%, 37:5% and 50% packet loss, respectively. However, due to space constraints we show only 12:5% and 50% packet loss for both schemes (more results will be available in the full paper). The first observation 2 We experimented with 9 images: 5 of them are natural images, 2 are cartoons, 1 is a computer-generated checker-board image and the last one is a text image. The average channel energies and standard deviations of channel energies of each image are calculated. It was found that for natural, computer-generated and cartoon images, the std of channel energies are all below 6% of the average channel energies. However, for the text image used, the std of channel energies is 138:8%. is that for 12:5% loss, scheme 1 gives a much better result, but with a price of a much higher redundancy. For 50% packet loss, the artifacts are quite different (blurriness in scheme 1 versus shot noise in scheme 2) in the two schemes and it is the matter of taste which one looks better (again with the trade-off in redundancy). Our conclusion is that the schemes presented offer an attractive solution to the problem of sending raw images over lossy or heterogeneous network connections with fair quality and very little overhead. This work is still in progress and we are trying to solve the same problem for compressed images.
