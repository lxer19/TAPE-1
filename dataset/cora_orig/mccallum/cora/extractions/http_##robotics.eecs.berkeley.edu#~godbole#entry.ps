Abstract: In this report, we present design of entry and exit maneuvers for vehicles entering and exiting from Automated Highway Systems (AHS). We assume, the traffic on AHS is organized according to the IVHS (Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems) architecture of [1]. We propose alternative highway configurations for merging and leaving the AHS lanes, either via the transition lane or via dedicated ramps. Communication protocols for coordinating entry and exit maneuvers & lateral and longitudinal control laws to execute these maneuvers are also presented in detail.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The work presented here was carried out with the particular IVHS (Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems) structure of <ref> [1, 2] </ref> in mind. The goal of this IVHS architecture is to design a system that can significantly increase safety and highway capacity without having to built new roads, by adding intelligence to both the vehicles and the roadside. <p> Theoretical studies indicate that capacity increase, if this scheme is implemented successfully, will be substantial (as high as four times the current capacity; See <ref> [1] </ref> for details). This estimate depends on properly designed entrances and exits that can meet the demands of increased highway capacity. AHS entrances are the narrow veins that feed the wide arteries of the automated lanes. <p> In Section 5, we will briefly describe simulations of entry/exit maneuvers in SmartPath. 2 AHS Control Architecture In the IVHS design of <ref> [1] </ref>, "platooning" is used as the basic element of automation. It is assumed that traffic on the highway is organized in groups of tightly spaced vehicles, which are given the name platoons. <p> It is assumed that traffic on the highway is organized in groups of tightly spaced vehicles, which are given the name platoons. Intuition suggests that doing this should lead to an increase in the capacity and throughput of the highway; indeed theoretical studies support the intuition (See <ref> [1] </ref> for details). Moreover this will be done without a negative impact on passenger safety. <p> Clearly implementation of such a scheme would require the vehicles to be automatically controlled, as human drivers are not fast and reliable enough to be able to form platoons. The design of such a large scale control system pauses a formidable problem. In the architecture outlined in <ref> [1] </ref> the system is organized in five layers. The top layer, called the network layer, is responsible for the flow of traffic on the entire highway system 1 . <p> Note that about 2-3 Km 3 An automated lane with platooning can carry up to 7,200 vehicles/hour if the intra-platoon separation is one meter, inter-platoon gap is three seconds and maximum platoon size of 10. (see <ref> [1] </ref> for details) But this figure does not take into account capacity used by lateral flow due to lane changes. Therefore, we use the figure of 6,000 vehicles/lane/hour. 5 of transition lane is needed per entry/exit. Parts of TL can potentially be used for manual traffic between two entrances.

Reference-contexts: Because the link layer bases its control actions on large numbers of vehicles, it inevitably has to use some form of aggregate information. The current design of link layer <ref> [3] </ref> is based on a fluid flow model. Thus the link layer controller treats the vehicles in a section statistically rather than by considering the state of individual vehicles or platoons.

Reference-contexts: The current design <ref> [4] </ref> uses protocols, in the form of finite state machines, to organize the maneuvers in a systematic way. They receive the commands of the link layer and aggregated sensor information from the individual vehicles (of the form "there is a vehicle in the adjacent lane"). <p> Depending on the available space, 9 the vehicle decides on how many vehicles can enter along with it, and if more than one, initi-ates a pre-platooning maneuver (similar to the merge maneuver in <ref> [4] </ref>); otherwise, it remains a free agent. At this point, the coordination layer issues the command, accelerate-to-enter, to its regulation layer, and waits till the regulation layer controller completes its acceleration and reaches the turn marker at the gate. The leader-id is needed for communication purposes between the vehicles. <p> In this case, vehicles on TL will not form platoons. Once on the surface section of TL, the vehicles find themselves adjacent to an automated lane. At this point, they will execute `lane change' maneuver according to <ref> [4, 8, 10] </ref> to change lane to AL. The automated vehicles on AL that want to exit, will similarly change lane (after becoming a free agent) onto TL. The TL section ends into an exit ramp. <p> After the completion of the maneuver, the vehicle again will switch from transition lane to the automated behavior, which is completely described in <ref> [4] </ref>. 20 car has received an acknowledgement to its entry-request and has formed the pre-platoon. automated lane. The simulation of exit maneuver follows the exit protocol described in section 4.1.

This requires a longitudinal sensor to determine distance to the stop sign. Similar to the lead control law of <ref> [8] </ref>, we define safe following distance on TL to be: d safe = v _x i + p ; where v = 1sec; p = 1m The free agents will follow each other with one second separation. Distance between two stopped vehicles will be 1m. <p> All the lead vehicle longitudinal control laws designed so far (See <ref> [8] </ref>) use on-board vehicle sensors (longitudinal and lateral distance and velocity sensors). This control law creates a unique problem for the sensors. There is no sensor on board the vehicle that can measure the velocity _x tgt or the distance x tgt of target platoon. <p> Lead Control law on TL: The aim of this controller is to follow the vehicle ahead with a safe inter-platoon separation. We use the lead control law of <ref> [8] </ref> for this purpose. As the vehicles on AL are also following the same control law, the post platoons on TL always remains in the `shadow' of the parent platoon on AL. 5. <p> We make use of the lead control of <ref> [8] </ref>. Recall that the lead controller of [8] can be used for `split' maneuver as well (although it would take much longer than the "split" control law used in [8]).

Reference-contexts: The barriers thus confine the location of these gates, permitting tight coordination between vehicles on the AL and TL. The last two assumptions are based on safety considerations, which are discussed in detail in <ref> [9] </ref>.

We now present control laws used for entry/exit under Arrangements 1, 3 and 4. 4.2.1 Entrance onto AL 1. Stop sign regulation Law: This longitudinal control law is used on TL before the stop sign, along with the `lane keep' lateral control law of [6]. <p> We assume that the target vehicle uses its radio transmitter to send its velocity and distance information to the preplatoon leader, at regular intervals. 3. Lane Change onto AL: We use control law presented in <ref> [10] </ref> to execute the lane change maneuver. The design of [10] is similar to the design of `accelerate to enter' control law presented above. In particular, a desired trajectory for the lateral position of the car is calculated and then feedback is used to asymptotically track this trajectory. <p> We assume that the target vehicle uses its radio transmitter to send its velocity and distance information to the preplatoon leader, at regular intervals. 3. Lane Change onto AL: We use control law presented in <ref> [10] </ref> to execute the lane change maneuver. The design of [10] is similar to the design of `accelerate to enter' control law presented above. In particular, a desired trajectory for the lateral position of the car is calculated and then feedback is used to asymptotically track this trajectory. The desired trajectory in this case is sinusoidal. <p> The following constraints on lateral acceleration and jerk are used in calculating the trajectory: a max = 0:05m=s 2 and j max = 0:1m=s 3 . In this case we want the entire preplatoon to change lane onto AL. We use the control law of <ref> [10] </ref> individually for each vehicle of the preplatoon to get the desired result. Note that the followers of the preplatoon can not start executing the lane change control law until they have reached the gate. The `accelerate to enter' control law is used for longitudinal dynamics during this time. 4. <p> By now, both vehicles are in the same lane. We use the control law of equation 1 with p = 1m and v = 0. 4.2.2 Exit from AL 1. Lane Change onto TL: We use the control law of <ref> [10] </ref> to execute lane change of a vehicle from AL onto TL. As only one vehicle changes lane through a gate at a given time, we can use the control law of [10] without any modifications. 2. <p> Lane Change onto TL: We use the control law of <ref> [10] </ref> to execute lane change of a vehicle from AL onto TL.

Close Up on AL: This is the same control law as in the entry maneuver discussed above. 3. <p> In this case, vehicles on TL will not form platoons. Once on the surface section of TL, the vehicles find themselves adjacent to an automated lane. At this point, they will execute `lane change' maneuver according to <ref> [4, 8, 10] </ref> to change lane to AL. The automated vehicles on AL that want to exit, will similarly change lane (after becoming a free agent) onto TL. The TL section ends into an exit ramp.

Reference-contexts: We will compare them from the point of view of complexity of control laws and effect on TL structure. In turn, this will also provide justification for choosing the strategies described above. Some of these alternatives were originally introduced in <ref> [11] </ref>. The basic assumption, and the main difference between entry/exit to AHS and manual highway, is that the traffic on AL does not directly assist (e.g. by decelerating, changing lane) the vehicles on TL in entry/exit.

Reference-contexts: We consider two alternative configurations for exit. Our basic assumption is that only one vehicle per platoon can exit through one gate. This ensures safety of the exited vehicles on TL from the `brakes on' failure of the previous vehicle. (See <ref> [12] </ref> for details). Different vehicles from an AL platoon will exit through different gates. In between two exit gates, AL platoon closes the gap created by the departed vehicle. The `close up' requires approximately 5 seconds. This requires the distance between two consecutive exit gates to be at least 150m.
