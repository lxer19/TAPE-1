Reference-contexts: In our case, the domain level system, containing the domain expertise, is an assumption based belief revision system with a problem solver and an assumption based truth maintenance system (ATMS) <ref> [ de Kleer, 1986 ] </ref> . The problem solver is a data driven production rule based system which works in tight connection with the ATMS. The functionality related to cooperation is represented as a distinct layer, the cooperation layer.

Reference-contexts: The approach we use for modelling belief is based on justifications, also referred as foundations theory of belief. According to this theory, belief revision consists, first, in giving up all beliefs that no longer have a satisfactory justification and, second, in adding new beliefs that have become justified <ref> [ Gardenfors, 1992 ] </ref> . An agent with belief revision skills which becomes aware of the existence of counterparts with whom to exchange beliefs relevant to the undergoing activity is said to perform distributed belief revision.

Reference-contexts: The accelerator operation and the maintenance of the underlying computing control system are complex tasks, difficult to survey, and where the necessary knowledge and the control system are naturally distributed. Because these facts suggested the application of DAI methods, CERN joined the ARCHON project <ref> [ Jennings and Wittig, 1992 ] </ref> , [ Wittig, 1992 ] as an application partner providing a large accelerator control system and two expert systems as a test-bed for the development and evaluation of the methodologies and software produced within this project.

Reference-contexts: Problems, insights and experiences gained whilst deploying ARCHON technology in real applications are described in [ Jennings , 1996 ] . These investigations <ref> [ Jennings , 1993 ] </ref> were among the first experiences in creating operational DAI systems by transforming existing intelligent systems of a real world application into members of a multi-agent community.

Reference-contexts: Several possibilities for cooperation were detected at CERN including the cooperation between accelerator setup and diagnosis, as well as the cooperation between the different aspects of timing diagnosis <ref> [ Skarek and Varga, 1996a ] </ref> . In this paper we will use a new cooperation scenario centered around an expert system developed at CERN using database technology [ Lewis , 1995 ] , [ Skarek and Varga, 1996b ] and mentioned in this paper later as BCD Checker.

This scenario is particularly well suited for the investigation of conflict resolution because conflicts and conflict resolution are inherent and necessary for the everyday operation of the accelerators.
