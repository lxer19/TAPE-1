Title: A New Look at Tree Models for Multiple Sequence Alignment  
Author: Dannie Durand 
Date: September 9, 1997  
Abstract: Evolutionary trees are frequently used as the underlying model in the design of algorithms, optimization criteria and software packages for multiple sequence alignment (MSA). In this paper, we reexamine the suitability of trees as a universal model for MSA in light of the broad range of biological questions that MSA's are used to address. A tree model consists of a tree topology and a model of accepted mutations along the branches. After surveying the major applications of MSA, examples from the molecular biology literature are used to illustrate situations in which this tree model fails. This occurs when the relationship between residues in a column cannot be described by a tree; for example, in some structural and functional applications of MSA. It also occurs in situations, such as lateral gene transfer, where an entire gene cannot be modeled by a unique tree. In cases of nonparsimonous data or convergent evolution, it may be difficult to find a consistent mutational model. We hope that this survey will promote dialogue between biologists and computer scientists, leading to more biologically realistic research on MSA.

Reference-contexts: Today there are two common approaches to structural alignment. First, one may associate a secondary structure type (ff-helix, fi-sheet or random coil) with each residue and then impose the additional constraint that only residues associated with the same type of secondary structure may be aligned (for example, <ref> [1, 62] </ref>). Second, structural alignments may be performed by minimizing the root mean square distance between the ff-carbon molecules in the backbone (see [84, 81], for an example). Structural information has also been used to set gap penalties.

Multiple sequence alignment is an extension of pairwise alignment to more than two sequences.

A major issue in multiple sequence alignment algorithms is the ability to handle gaps; that is, sequences of one or more contiguous indels.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is important in functional, structural and evolutionary studies of sequence data. Much research has focussed on the formal study of MSA as an optimization problem and several optimization criteria have been discussed at length in the literature <ref> [8, 34, 42, 44, 58, 65, 75, 85] </ref>. <p> Approximation algorithms for both SP and TA have been presented. Gusfield [34] presented a (22=k)-approximation algorithm for SP alignment, while Pevsner [58] reduced the approximation factor to (23=k). Subsequently, Bafna et al. <ref> [8] </ref> presented a (2l=k)-approximation algorithm, for any fixed constant l. For tree alignment, Gusfield [34] showed that the cost of the minimum spanning tree of the sequences is at most twice the optimal cost, yielding a 2-approximation.

Statistical characterizations of sequence and structural motifs include Helix-Turn-Helix [49], the calcium-binding EF-hand [47] and libraries of motifs such as <ref> [9, 39, 70] </ref>. Statistical representations of patterns in nucleic acids have been used to characterize and search for regulatory regions in DNA (see, for example, [17, 26, 28, 72]).

Reference-contexts: In general, end gap penalties are inappropriate for local alignments, when the sequence lengths differ substantially or when the sequences may not be related [32]. Lesk et al. [52] and Barton and Sternberg <ref> [10] </ref> have suggested that the gap cost should be much higher in regions of known structural importance. Unfortunately, this approach can only be used if structural information is available. Biological Metrics for MSA The methods described above use only primary sequence information to align sequences. <p> Second, structural alignments may be performed by minimizing the root mean square distance between the ff-carbon molecules in the backbone (see [84, 81], for an example). Structural information has also been used to set gap penalties. In separate studies, Lesk et al. [52] and Barton and Sternberg <ref> [10] </ref> observed that, due to selection constraints, indels seldom occur in structurally important regions. If structural information is available for at least one sequence in the alignment, gap penalties can be increased in regions encoding helices and strands of fi sheets. <p> For all four data sets, supporting evidence for the motifs from structural or mutational studies was available. Barton and Sternberg <ref> [10] </ref> have also used structural alignments to validate sequence-based alignments. The use of structural information to guide or validate alignments is only possible for data sets where structural information is available. Another consideration is whether a structural approach to MSA is useful in all cases.

Reference-contexts: Residues with different evolutionary histories within a single gene can also occur due to horizontal gene transfer, the transfer of genetic material between species. For example, sequences similar to the Fn3 module in fibronectin have been found in bacterial proteins <ref> [11] </ref>. Fibronectin is a protein found in animals. Since Fn3 is found in both bacterial and animal proteins, one would expect to find Fn3 modules throughout the tree of life.

However, Fn3 sequences have not been found in simpler eukaryotes, plants or fungi [11], suggesting a direct transfer of genetic material between bacteria and animals.

Reference-contexts: Variable length regions connecting ff-helices and fi-sheets, referred to as random coils, are much less constrained. Combinations of several secondary structures that are found in many, unrelated proteins are referred to as motifs (see <ref> [12] </ref> for an example).

Residues that are involved the biochemical function of the protein are also highly conserved.

Reference-contexts: In addition, many software tools for constructing MSA's are available, mostly based on heuristics although some use exact or branch-and-bound techniques (see <ref> [16, 54] </ref> for surveys.)

Reference-contexts: For proteins, substitution matrices are used. Substitution matrices can be based on observed substitution frequencies in sequences known to be related or on the chemical properties of the amino acid residues. The most widely used substitution matrices are the PAM matrices and their log-odds counterpart MDM 78 <ref> [19, 68] </ref>. PAM matrices were constructed using observed amino acid substitutions in homologous sequences and are parameterized according to the degree of evolutionary divergence. One PAM (or accepted point mutation) corresponds to an average of one point mutation per 100 amino acid residues. <p> A profile can be computed by multiplying a substitution matrix with the position weight matrix for the desired pattern: P r;p = i=1 where S i;j is a substitution matrix such as the Dayhoff <ref> [19, 68] </ref> or Blossom [39] matrices. In addition to a row for each residue, profiles generally have two rows for gaps, one for gap initiation and one for gap extension. This allows the fact that some columns may have many gaps to be reflected in the profile.

Reference-contexts: One situation where this occurs is exon shu*ing. Most vertebrate genes consist of coding regions (exons) separated by DNA segments that are not translated into proteins (introns). The discovery of this intron/exon structure lead to the theory of exon shu*ing, first proposed by Gilbert in 1978 <ref> [29] </ref>. This theory posits that exons represent functionally and/or structurally important subunits of proteins, that introns occur at the boundaries of these modules and that proteins share and reuse the modules that exons encode.

Reference-contexts: Another consideration is whether a structural approach to MSA is useful in all cases.

Reference-contexts: From that alignment, an initial estimate of the structure of the new protein is obtained from the structure of the known protein. This estimate is refined by perturbing the structure to accommodate the physical properties of the substituted amino acid in the new protein (see <ref> [31] </ref> for an example). Secondary structure prediction methods have generally been statistical or learning-based approaches. Using a data base of known structures, these methods associate similar structures with patterns found in the primary sequence. In recent years, these methods have been substantially enhanced by the use of multiple sequence alignments.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is important in functional, structural and evolutionary studies of sequence data. Much research has focussed on the formal study of MSA as an optimization problem and several optimization criteria have been discussed at length in the literature <ref> [8, 34, 42, 44, 58, 65, 75, 85] </ref>. <p> This implies that all sequences share a common ancestor. Restricting the topology makes this approach much more tractable and it has been used as an underlying structure in many algorithms and analyses (e.g., <ref> [5, 34] </ref>). Altschul and Lipman [5] have shown that SP, TA and SA costs for the same column can be very different. The SP, TA and SA alignment costs for the column (AAAACC) are shown in Figure 1. <p> Algorithms that reduce the time to find an exact solution by pruning the search space using an upper bound on the cost of the alignment have been presented by Carillo and Lipman [13] and Kececioglu [44]. Approximation algorithms for both SP and TA have been presented. Gusfield <ref> [34] </ref> presented a (22=k)-approximation algorithm for SP alignment, while Pevsner [58] reduced the approximation factor to (23=k). Subsequently, Bafna et al.

Reference-contexts: The simplest such cost is the affine gap function where the cost of a gap of length x, is g + lx, where g is the gap creation penalty and l is the gap extension penalty. More complex parameterized gap functions have been considered as well <ref> [35, 83] </ref>. In addition, gaps at either end of either sequence may or may not be penalized, depending on the application. In general, end gap penalties are inappropriate for local alignments, when the sequence lengths differ substantially or when the sequences may not be related [32].

Reference-contexts: In RNA, these secondary structures include helical regions resulting from Watson-Crick base pairing (that is, the same bonding that unites the double helix of DNA molecules) and a variety of loops and bulges. A detailed survey of RNA structure is given in <ref> [36] </ref>. In order to maintain the structure of the RNA molecule, distant residues that bind to form a structural interaction are constrained to mutate together. Thus covariance in a multiple sequence alignment of related RNA molecules is a major source of predictive information. <p> Tetraloops in rRNA provide another example of convergent evolution <ref> [36, 87] </ref>. Tetraloops are strings of six bases that form loops at the end of helices in rRNA structures. The two end bases bond, allowing the internal four bases to form a loop. Although there are 256 possible inner loop sequences, only a small number actually occur in nature.

Reference-contexts: The BLOSSUM matrices, also based on observed substitution frequencies, were computed more recently from a larger set of homologous sequences <ref> [39] </ref>. It has been argued that when the objective of alignment is to obtain structural rather than evolutionary information, matrices based on biochemical properties such as hydrophobicity will give better alignments [6, 25, 48, 60]. <p> A profile can be computed by multiplying a substitution matrix with the position weight matrix for the desired pattern: P r;p = i=1 where S i;j is a substitution matrix such as the Dayhoff [19, 68] or Blossom <ref> [39] </ref> matrices. In addition to a row for each residue, profiles generally have two rows for gaps, one for gap initiation and one for gap extension. This allows the fact that some columns may have many gaps to be reflected in the profile. <p> Some examples of the use of these representations in searching protein data bases include [33, 79, 80].

Statistical representations of patterns in nucleic acids have been used to characterize and search for regulatory regions in DNA (see, for example, [17, 26, 28, 72]).

Reference-contexts: Early sequence alignments placed the malaria parasite DHFR residue Phe 223 downstream of structurally conserved regions of the protein (within the linker region which joins DHFR to thymidy-late synthase, forming a bifunctional protein in protozoa and plants) <ref> [41, 78] </ref>. This result was puzzling because mutational studies had suggested that Phe 223 plays an important role in drug sensitivity. Realignment using sequences from the related parasite Toxoplasma gondii indicated that Phe 223 is more likely homologous to a portion of the fi-sheet which comprises the enzyme backbone [62].

Much research has focussed on the formal study of MSA as an optimization problem and several optimization criteria have been discussed at length in the literature <ref> [8, 34, 42, 44, 58, 65, 75, 85] </ref>. <p> Wang and Jiang [85] has shown that SP alignment is NP-complete and Sweedyk and Warnow [75] showed that general TA is NP-complete. TA for a fixed binary tree topology is also NP-complete [85] and a polynomial time approximation scheme has been presented <ref> [42] </ref>. However, when the fixed topology is a star, TA is max-SNP hard [85]. This means that no polynomial time approximation scheme can deliver an arbitrarily good approximation. <p> For tree alignment, Gusfield [34] showed that the cost of the minimum spanning tree of the sequences is at most twice the optimal cost, yielding a 2-approximation. A polynomial time approximation scheme, yielding a (1+*)-approximation for arbitrarily small * has been presented by Jiang et al. <ref> [42] </ref> for a fixed topology. The number of heuristics for multiple sequence alignment is too numerous to mention them all here. Most multiple sequence alignments fall into a few common approaches. Many heuristics compute pairwise alignments for all k sequence pairs and then progressively merge the pairwise alignments.

Reference-contexts: Biological Metrics for MSA The methods described above use only primary sequence information to align sequences.

Reference-contexts: In addition, gaps at either end of either sequence may or may not be penalized, depending on the application. In general, end gap penalties are inappropriate for local alignments, when the sequence lengths differ substantially or when the sequences may not be related [32]. Lesk et al. <ref> [52] </ref> and Barton and Sternberg [10] have suggested that the gap cost should be much higher in regions of known structural importance. Unfortunately, this approach can only be used if structural information is available. Biological Metrics for MSA The methods described above use only primary sequence information to align sequences. <p> Second, structural alignments may be performed by minimizing the root mean square distance between the ff-carbon molecules in the backbone (see [84, 81], for an example). Structural information has also been used to set gap penalties. In separate studies, Lesk et al. <ref> [52] </ref> and Barton and Sternberg [10] observed that, due to selection constraints, indels seldom occur in structurally important regions. If structural information is available for at least one sequence in the alignment, gap penalties can be increased in regions encoding helices and strands of fi sheets.

Reference-contexts: In addition, many software tools for constructing MSA's are available, mostly based on heuristics although some use exact or branch-and-bound techniques (see <ref> [16, 54] </ref> for surveys.) The concept of an evolutionary tree is a widely used model for MSA, where the tree encodes the historical relationships between the modern sequences in the alignment. Tree models have been used to construct column scoring functions for optimization criteria. <p> This is not a comprehensive survey of multiple sequence alignment algorithms. Surveys of multiple sequence alignment algorithms can be found in [16] and in the introduction to [58]. An experimental comparison of multiple sequence algorithms is described in <ref> [54] </ref>. Multiple sequence alignment involves lining up a group of sequences to reveal similarities shared across the group. A sequence is a string of symbols chosen from an alphabet, , where = fA; C; G; T g for nucleic acid sequences and contains the twenty amino acids for protein sequences. <p> Both groups showed that this approach led to substantially better alignments. 5 Structural and functional information has been used to validate multiple sequence alignments. In a comprehensive study of twelve different multiple alignment programs, McClure et al. <ref> [54] </ref> measured algorithm performance by computing a numerical score based on the ability to find known motifs in four different data sets. For all four data sets, supporting evidence for the motifs from structural or mutational studies was available. <p> The methods differ in the strategies they use for merging, which include the clustering and consensus approaches and merging according to a tree. The resulting multiple alignment will depend on the order in which the pairwise alignments were merged. McClure et al. <ref> [54] </ref> also report that methods are sensitive to the size and composition of the data set. A second common heuristic is the use of consensus patterns.

Reference-contexts: This is another example of the observation, also made by McClure et al. [54],that MSA's are very sensitive to sequence choice. Phe 223 is thought to play an indirect role in enzyme activity, interacting with His 34 , within the active site <ref> [59] </ref>. The residue that plays this stabilizing role may have changed over time: a residue in a different position may provide this stabilizing effect in certain taxa (e.g. kinetoplastid parasites such as Leishmania and Trypanosoma) [61].

Reference-contexts: It has been argued that when the objective of alignment is to obtain structural rather than evolutionary information, matrices based on biochemical properties such as hydrophobicity will give better alignments <ref> [6, 25, 48, 60] </ref>. A major issue in multiple sequence alignment algorithms is the ability to handle gaps; that is, sequences of one or more contiguous indels. The simplest model of insertions/deletions is to assign a fixed penalty to every indel.

In this scenario, a random mutation allows a previously inactive residue to take on the functional role played by Phe 223 .

Reference-contexts: Today there are two common approaches to structural alignment. First, one may associate a secondary structure type (ff-helix, fi-sheet or random coil) with each residue and then impose the additional constraint that only residues associated with the same type of secondary structure may be aligned (for example, <ref> [1, 62] </ref>). Second, structural alignments may be performed by minimizing the root mean square distance between the ff-carbon molecules in the backbone (see [84, 81], for an example). Structural information has also been used to set gap penalties. <p> In their studies on protozoan parasites, Roos and colleagues have sought to design drugs that inhibit a metabolic protein in the parasite without affecting the infected host <ref> [62, 20, 21] </ref>. This requires identifying regions of structural or functional importance that differ substantially between protozoan and human versions of the DHFR protein. <p> This result was puzzling because mutational studies had suggested that Phe 223 plays an important role in drug sensitivity. Realignment using sequences from the related parasite Toxoplasma gondii indicated that Phe 223 is more likely homologous to a portion of the fi-sheet which comprises the enzyme backbone <ref> [62] </ref>. The T. gondii sequence thus provided additional information that suggested an alternative alignment. Other protozoan sequences in the alignment have substantial, and different, nucleotide biases 1 . The T. gondii gene, which has relatively equal nucleotide distribution links the other protozoan sequences, facilitating alignment.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is important in functional, structural and evolutionary studies of sequence data. Much research has focussed on the formal study of MSA as an optimization problem and several optimization criteria have been discussed at length in the literature <ref> [8, 34, 42, 44, 58, 65, 75, 85] </ref>. <p> This definition is mathematically natural but not biologically intuitive. Tree alignment <ref> [65, 66] </ref> is based on the assumption that the residues in the columns of the multiple sequence alignment share an evolutionary history and that this history can be expressed as a tree. Under this model, a column is scored by computing the cost of the underlying tree. <p> An optimal alignment of k species can be obtained using dynamic programming in O (2 k N k ) evaluations of the cost function d using O (N k ) space. An exact TA algorithm for a given tree topology has been presented by Sankoff <ref> [65] </ref>. This requires O (M (2N ) k ) steps where M is the number of internal nodes, k is the number sequences and N is the maximum length over all sequences.

Reference-contexts: For proteins, substitution matrices are used. Substitution matrices can be based on observed substitution frequencies in sequences known to be related or on the chemical properties of the amino acid residues. The most widely used substitution matrices are the PAM matrices and their log-odds counterpart MDM 78 <ref> [19, 68] </ref>. PAM matrices were constructed using observed amino acid substitutions in homologous sequences and are parameterized according to the degree of evolutionary divergence. One PAM (or accepted point mutation) corresponds to an average of one point mutation per 100 amino acid residues. <p> A profile can be computed by multiplying a substitution matrix with the position weight matrix for the desired pattern: P r;p = i=1 where S i;j is a substitution matrix such as the Dayhoff <ref> [19, 68] </ref> or Blossom [39] matrices. In addition to a row for each residue, profiles generally have two rows for gaps, one for gap initiation and one for gap extension. This allows the fact that some columns may have many gaps to be reflected in the profile.

Reference-contexts: Residues that are similar under selective pressure because they perform the same function can appear to be closely related. An example of this occurs in cows and colobine monkeys, species that independently evolved foregut fermentation <ref> [71] </ref>. In order to maximize the nutritional benefits of foregut fermentation, the enzyme lysozyme had to evolve in these species to function in the acidic, pepsin-rich environment of the stomach. In other species, lysozyme is only needed in the intestines.

Reference-contexts: The simplest such cost is the affine gap function where the cost of a gap of length x, is g + lx, where g is the gap creation penalty and l is the gap extension penalty.

In addition, gaps at either end of either sequence may or may not be penalized, depending on the application. In general, end gap penalties are inappropriate for local alignments, when the sequence lengths differ substantially or when the sequences may not be related [32].
