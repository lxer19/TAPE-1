Abstract: We discuss the treatment of ellipsis in a spoken language route planning enquiry service which uses the Core Language Engine (CLE) as its linguistic processor. We show how use of the CLE allows us to separate the interpretation of ellipsis in a dialogue context from the more general issue of dialogue management in a dialogue context and, especially, to factor out the linguistic influences on such interpretation and place them where they belong in the linguistic processor. The route planning application was developed with a Wizard of Oz corpus to help guide it and we discuss the application of the CLE to some particularly interesting and potentially troublesome data from that corpus.

Reference-contexts: We briefly discuss below two systems that represent two very different points in the range of possibilities. The early GUS system <ref> [3] </ref> marks an almost minimalist position with respect to fragmentary input. Each question that the system can ask is associated with a sentence frame and fragmentary inputs are interpreted by simply plugging the fragments into the frames and testing whether the result is parsable.

Reference-contexts: The CLE is a wide-coverage general purpose natural language processing system with facilities for reasoning and understanding in context. The application was developed with a Wizard of Oz (WOZ) corpus <ref> [10, 4] </ref> to help guide it and ellipsis proved to be a prominent feature within that corpus. In section 2, we briefly describe the phenomenon of ellipsis, its importance for current dialogue systems and some extant proposals for handling it.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, the method even allows a fragmentary answer of `from Cambridge' to be interpreted as `The user wants to go from Cambridge' even though the original question was naturally interpreted as seeking the destination. The approach to ellipsis in the CLE is discussed fully in <ref> [5] </ref>. The method is a powerful one in that it appeals only to the structure of the meaning representations for a general purpose English grammar. Resolution is a linguistic matter and inherently domain-independent. The linguistic emphasis resembles that of GUS.

Reference-contexts: The task of ellipsis resolution is to find a suitable property to instantiate the variable P and, in general, this is done by inspection of the meanings of earlier utterances (though one can also invoke `contextually salient properties' or inference if necessary). The method resembles that of <ref> [6] </ref>. For example, suppose `Cambridge' answers `Where do you want to go'. The (unscoped) question meaning is want (9 Y ; user ; (go (9 Z ; user ) & to (Z; Wh X )), where Y and Z are event variables and Wh X is a wh-binding operator.

Reference-contexts: A fragmentary answer such as `Tuesday' can be plugged into the frame yielding the complete sentence `I want to return on Tuesday. The parentheses surrounding `on' simply indicate that `on' is optionally part of the frame. In contrast to this purely linguistic approach, the recent Sundial system <ref> [7] </ref> has a `belief module' which constructs a context model from its inputs. The context model is a semantic network. It may be the result of interpreting several earlier utterances. Interpreting a fragment means integrating its representation into the current network.

Reference-contexts: They caught the train', `they' needs to refer to a complex entity which is not explicitly referred to earlier. The solu-tion is to use a rule of inference that allows one to construct plural entities like `John-and-Mary' from their components. These entities may then serve as antecedents. (cf. <ref> [8] </ref>). Our analysis of the fragment `both', though not yet fully implemented, is to represent it by P (both hthem i), in which a pronominal construct triggers the inference rule used above for explicit plural pronouns.

In the Autoroute planning scenario <ref> [10] </ref> , the Wizard has to ascertain the values of various journey parameters. The parameters concern the origin, destination and time of the journey and whether the user requires the quickest journey by time or the shortest journey by distance.

Reference-contexts: That is, speakers frequently provide phrases which are not complete sentences themselves but whose complete sense can be recovered easily from the context of utterance, at least by humans. Indeed <ref> [11] </ref> has even suggested that increasing ellipticity can be used as a criterion for dividing dialogues into constituent units. Ellipsis is particularly prominent in current dialogue systems which are generally information-providers and retain the initiative in dialogues by themselves asking the questions.

Reference-contexts: This method therefore helps enforce a very useful constraint on dialogue systems. This is that the sort of material that the CLE asks of the user should be material that the CLE can analyze itself. Given the observed feature of dialogue convergence <ref> [12] </ref>, this is no bad constraint. In comparison with the SUNDIAL architecture, the CLE does not treat ellipsis resolution at the level of dialogue management that is with reference to semantic networks representing an understanding of possibly many distinct utterances constituting the dialogue so far.
