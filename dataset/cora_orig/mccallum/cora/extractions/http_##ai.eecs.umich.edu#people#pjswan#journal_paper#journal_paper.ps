Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate that a passive vibration strategy can bring a 1 degree of freedom ball to a specified periodic trajectory from all initial configurations. We draw motivation from the problem of parts feeding in sensorless assembly. We provide simulation results suggesting the relevance of our analytical results to the parts feeding problem.

Reference-contexts: The simulation uses a standard 3 degree of freedom Newtonian flight model when the part is not in contact with the table, and employs an impact model developed by Wang and Mason <ref> [30] </ref> as soon as a contact is made. As mentioned above, each part is integrated in isolation from all the others: part-part interactions are not modeled. Each part was modeled as a 1 fi 2 fi 4 cm block of aluminum. <p> The simulation labeled "Chaotic" was capable of reorienting parts back and forth between the 0 ffi and 90 ffi stable states. Analysis of why some vibrations are more effective than others is difficult for the following reasons. The impact model <ref> [30] </ref> has 5 dynamically distinct contact modes whose selection depends not only on the 4 by horizontal lines on the table. Part-part interactions are not modeled. In the top scene, 91 initial conditions of a part are shown in parallel laminar plates.

Reference-contexts: The rejected parts are then recirculated, and repeat the process indefinitely. Rejection-based feeders include vibratory bowls, centrifugal disks, and various conveyor-based approaches. Custom tooling for these feeders often makes them expensive and inflexible. Through research into the probability distribution of stable random part orientations <ref> [31] </ref>, it is clear that for a typical part only 20% or less of the parts will randomly assume the correct orientation. For this reason, rejection based methods are very inefficient [6].
