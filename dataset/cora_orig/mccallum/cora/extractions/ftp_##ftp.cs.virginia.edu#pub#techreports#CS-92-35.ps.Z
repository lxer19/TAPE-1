Reference-contexts: Each chain contributes at most 1 to the overall density, and once a maximal chain is detected, it is "removed" from the net and the process is iterated over the remaining terminals, until the net is covered. According to Dilworth's theorem from lattice theory <ref> [7] </ref>, every partially ordered set of size n must contain a chain (or an anti chain) of size at least p n, and such maximal chains can be computed efficiently in O (n log n) time. We call this algorithm PEEL (Figure 7). <p> Assume that the algorithm stops when we have peeled off k chains and/or antichains, i.e., a k = 0. We want to show that k 2 p n. According to Dilworth's Theorem <ref> [7] </ref>, the size of the (i + 1)- th chain/antichain is at least p a i . Thus, a i+1 a i p a i . Moreover, it is easy to verify that p p p 2 .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper, we address a new problem formulation for spanning and Steiner tree constructions in the Manhattan plane. Our objective is to minimize the density of such interconnection trees, where density reflects a concept that is closely related to the stabbing number studied in computational geometry <ref> [8] </ref>. The motivation for our work lies in the area minimization requirement that is implicit in the global routing phase of VLSI layout; global routing entails building (spanning or Steiner) interconnection trees over given signal nets which correspond to point sets in the Manhattan plane.
