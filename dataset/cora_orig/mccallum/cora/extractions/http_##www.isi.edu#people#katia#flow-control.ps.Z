Abstract: Most existing feedback control mechanisms based on probabilistic suppression address the feedback implosion problem by suppressing feedback using timers based on round-trip time (RTT) information. This approach requires that all receivers compute RTT to the data source. We present an algorithm whose major benefit derives from the fact that it does not need to compute RTT from receivers to the source, and does not require knowledge of group membership or network topology. We use a small set of representative receivers and probabilistic suppression to limit feedback. We believe that our approach will perform well in real networks. Simulations using randomly-generated network topologies of varying sizes with pessimistic network loss rates show that representatives considerably reduce the amount of feedback compared to a purely suppression-based scheme. For various multicast group sizes, a few representatives can keep the amount of feedback low while not degrading feedback timeliness. Keywords: Multicast, feedback, suppression, representatives

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction While many existing multicast transport protocols such as SRM <ref> [5] </ref>, and RTP [11], target delay sensitive, real-time applications, little has been done to address multipoint bulk data transfer services, such as multicast FTP. The feedback suppression algorithm we present is part of our efforts to build a scalable flow controlled multicast transport mechanism suitable for bulk data transfer applications. <p> Our solution addresses the problem of feedback implosion [3], while providing the frequent and timely feedback required by a flow control algorithm. Our solution does not require knowledge of the multi-cast group membership or network support. Several existing reliable multicast transport protocols, such as SRM <ref> [5] </ref>, use RTT-based probabilistic suppression to avoid feedback implosion at the source. In RTT-based suppression, each receiver measures RTT to the source and sets a feedback timer based on its distance from the source. <p> Receivers in the SRM protocol <ref> [5] </ref>, which was designed to support the WB distributed whiteboard application, delay their retransmission requests for a random interval, uniformly distributed between the current time and the one-way trip time to the source. <p> based on the assumption that a representative that has not sent a NACK is having the fewest number of congestion problems. 4.5 Timers Since we cannot compute RTT between the receivers and the source, we cannot use the "precise" RTT to set up the suppression timers as done in SRM <ref> [5] </ref>. So we are forced to resort to cruder measures. We can partially compensate for using loose timers by using representatives to provide fast feedback. Since representatives provide immediate feedback on behalf of the subtrees they cover, we need "backup" timers for those losses not covered by representatives.

Reference-contexts: However, receiver-based protocols also suffer from the feedback implosion problem, especially when losses occur higher up in the multicast tree in larger groups over lossy networks. In this section we focus on proposed solutions to the feedback implosion problem in the context of reliable multicast transport protocols. In <ref> [6] </ref>, solutions to the feedback implosion problem are classified as structure-based or timer-based. <p> The goal is that group members closer to the source send their feedback sooner suppressing feedback from farther away members. A site uses periodic session messages to measure its distance (based on the resulting RTT) to the other group members. The Deterministic Timeouts for Reliable Multicast (DTRM) <ref> [6] </ref> algorithm also uses RTT between receivers and the sender to compute the receivers' suppression timeouts. The feedback control mechanism proposed in [9] does not fall into either the structure-based or the timer-based categories.

Reference-contexts: While such networks were easy to generate and provided useful preliminary information on the feedback suppression mechanism, it was necessary to test the feedback suppression mechanism on more realistic networks. To generate more realistic topologies we use Steve Hotz's Network Topology Generator <ref> [7] </ref>. The networks generated were three level networks with low delay links at the first and second levels and large delay links at the third level. <p> This is intended to be a loose approximation of a real internetwork topology with a high speed backbone, slower regional networks and finally slow final links. The loss rates were randomly chosen over the interval 0-5%. See <ref> [7] </ref> for more details on the generation of the networks. The receivers are all at the third level and hence will tend to be leaves, but still have different distances to the source.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, in the receiver-initiated approach to reliability, receivers detect packet losses and request its retransmission by generating a NACK. Placing the responsibility of recovering from packet losses on the receiver helps alleviate the ACK implosion problem. The performance comparison study presented in <ref> [10] </ref> confirms that receiver-initiated multicast transport protocols have better scalability propoerties than their sender-initiated counterparts. For this reason, most reliable multipoint transport protocols are either pure receiver-initiated or use a hybrid approach by combining receiver- and sender-initiated reliability.
