Title: A Telerobotics Construction Set with Integrated Performance Analysis  
Author: Marjorie Skubic George V. Kondraske James D. Wise George J. Khoury Richard A. Volz Scott Askew 
Abstract: The Universities Space Automation and Robotics Consortium (USARC) was established to promote research into robotics and telerobotics for remote applications. An important part of the work of the Consortium has been the design and implementation of the Telerobotic Construction Set (TCS), which enables the building of modular telerobotic networks. On-line and off-line performance analyses are integrated into TCS using quantitative analytical models. This provides the capabilities of measuring and predicting performance and system workloads quantitatively under different conditions, such as different levels of remote autonomy or different operator interfaces. This paper presents the methodology used in the performance/workload analysis and describes recent experiments, measuring teleoperation performance under time delay.

Data object vocabulary. The unit of communication between modules is the TelRIP Data Object. A data object is similar to an object oriented programming object in that it contains a self identifying data record. TelRIP data objects lack an explicit class hierarchy and embedded method code.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The term telerobotics has been used to represent human control of remote subsystems, including supervisory control of autonomous components <ref> [3] </ref>. Despite thirty years of research, few systems exist which enable the research, development and evaluation of telerobotic systems at both the systems level and the component level. An open research question still exists concerning the prediction of performance of teler-obotic systems, given component characteristics and task information.

Reference-contexts: It also does not provide information which could be used to predict the performance in a different task. Other studies have been done which measure the effect of changing one component. For instance, manual control modes have been compared to test the effect of force reflection <ref> [4, 14] </ref>. Manual and shared control modes have been compared [7]. These studies were task-oriented and did not provide a mechanism for characterizing the component or predicting the performance of a system under different tasks. A few researchers have used strategies that provide performance prediction.

Reference-contexts: The TCS can be used to build telerobotics systems operating over a wide-area network, for research in tele-control over large distances (i.e., different cities). The TCS provides for the connection and configuration of a variety of resources, including robotic devices, manual controllers, cameras, computers, and force sensors <ref> [13, 5] </ref>. remote robot work site, and a monitoring site. 1 It consists of a number of clearly defined functional modules communicating via streams of data packets using a few well-defined formats. In such a diagram, the modules themselves and the data they produce and consume define the system.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, measures of neuromotor workload associated with manual controller operation are ob tained using an information theory based model that allows derivation of the amount of channel capacity utilized during an operation <ref> [9] </ref>. These are combined with measures of neuromotor channel capacity availability based on Fitts' Law type tests. In the case of the latter, the human system is removed totally from the telerobotic system context and test tasks are performed that maximally stress neuromotor channel capacities. <p> The USARC TCS was used for both experiments, which involved distributed telerobotics between universities. Network delays due to internet connections varied over a wide range, from 50 ms to 7 seconds. The average time delay was 100 to 200 ms.

The component of interest was a multiple degree-of-freedom manual controller.

Reference-contexts: GSPT was motivated by performance measurement issues in human performance, but evolved to address general problems of quantifying system performance. We also use GPST to help understand the contribution of multiple subsystems to a system's ability to accomplish tasks.

First, within the domain of interest, a system is identified along with its function (i.e., purpose). Note that any hierarchical level of abstraction may be selected. This discussion applies to total systems or system components.
