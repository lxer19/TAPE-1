Abstract: We tend to think of what we really know as what we can talk about, and disparage knowledge that we can't verbalize. [Dowling 1989, p. 252]

Reference-contexts: One of the ways to represent nonverbal knowledge is through examples. 2 Exemplar-based model The exemplar-based model is based on the idea that objects are categorized by their similarity to one or set of stored examples. There is much evidence from psychological studies to support exemplar-based categorization by humans <ref> [Brooks, 1978; Hintzman, 1986; Medin and Schaffer, 1978; Reed, 1972] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In fact, the nearest neighbor algorithm is one of the simplest learning methods known, and yet no other algorithm has been shown to outperform it consistently <ref> [Cost and Salzberg, 1993, p. 76] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, reliable pattern recognition has been performed by computers using examples [Aha, et al., 1991; Cost and Salzberg, 1993; Fujinaga, et al., 1989]. 3 Nearest-neighbor classifier The exemplar-based model can be implemented by nearest-neighbor (NN) algorithm <ref> [Cover and Hart, 1967] </ref>, which is a classification scheme to determine the class of a given sample by its feature vector. Distances between feature vectors of an unclassified sample and previously classified samples are calculated. The class represented by the closest neighbor is then assigned to the unclassified sample.

Reference-contexts: The current implementation of NN classifier for optical music recognition by the author includes the use of genetic algorithms <ref> [Holland, 1975] </ref> to find the optimal set of feature weights and thus further improving the recognition capabilities. 4 Conclusion The exemplar-based model offers a promising and alternative approach for structural music understanding and may be applied to other types of categorization and learning tasks.
