Abstract: When we work with information from multiple sources, the formats of the knowledge bases may not be uniform. It would be desirable to be able to combine a knowledge base of default rules with one containing autoepistemic formulas. Previous works on relating default logic and autoepistemic logic mostly impose some constraints on autoepistemic logic, and thus are not suitable for combining the two logics. We first present a fixed point formulation of autoepistemic logic analogous to that of default logic. Then we introduce a possible world framework with a partition structure, which corresponds to our intuitive notion of accessibility as linking alternate "possible" worlds. We show that both default logic and autoepistemic logic can be characterized using this common framework, which is important for developing a semantics applicable to the two logics, both separately and combined. We show one way of integrating the two logics to produce hybrid extensions, and provide both a syntactic fixed point and a semantic possible partition sequence characterization for this approach.

Reference-contexts: However, most of these efforts impose additional constraints on autoepistemic logic, such as requiring stronger grounded-ness or using different base modal systems. Thus, although default logic can be translated into some variants of autoepistemic logic, the two logics cannot be easily combined using these translation schemes. Gottlob <ref> [Got93] </ref> gave a translation for embedding default logic into unrestricted autoepistemic logic, which could be used for such purposes. We address the syntactic and semantic relationship between default logic and autoepis-temic logic from slightly different angles. <p> The translation schemes used in [Kon88, MT90, Tru91a] all fall into this category. This suggests that the specific syntactic form of the translation is not crucial, since we can choose from a whole family of translations as long as they adhere to the simple schema outlined above. Gottlob <ref> [Got93] </ref> proposed a schema for translating default logic into standard autoepis-temic logic by adding a "grounding formula" to a default theory. This can serve as a starting point for combining the two logics.

Reference-contexts: Our approach is similar to that of Lin and Shoham's logic of GK <ref> [LS90] </ref>, in that we provide a common framework in which both default logic and autoepistemic logic can be expressed. GK employs two independent modal operators, K and A, and thus there are two accessibility relations.

Given the similarity between the fixed point formulations of default logic and autoepistemic logic, we can also specify a possible model for an autoepistemic theory using the possible order framework. <p> Note that the last element W l of the autoepistemic possible model is the same as the complete S5 structure in Moore's formulation of possible world semantics <ref> [Moo84] </ref>. Although our formulation using the possible model is not simpler, it provides a more procedural characterization. Example 16 A = fLp ! p; :Lp ! qg. The premise set A has two stable expansions, T 1 with the kernel fpg, and T 2 with the kernel fqg.
