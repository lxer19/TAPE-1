Reference-contexts: While providing a nice justification to the concept of differential quotients in a similar way as nonstandard analysis <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, it puts the methods of forward automatic differentiation in a more philosophical and less technical light and even allows the computation of derivatives in cases where conventional automatic differentiation fails [3].

Reference-contexts: While providing a nice justification to the concept of differential quotients in a similar way as nonstandard analysis [1, 2], it puts the methods of forward automatic differentiation in a more philosophical and less technical light and even allows the computation of derivatives in cases where conventional automatic differentiation fails <ref> [3] </ref>. On the practical side, the methods can be applied for the study of weakly nonlinear systems in which the equations of motions as well as their flows can be represented by very quickly converging Taylor series.

Reference-contexts: In the field of optics, one of the subfields of this area, these coefficients have been traditionally known as aberrations and, until the advent of automatic differentiation methods, in particular in the connection with differential algebraic methods, have been next to impossible to compute for higher orders <ref> [4] </ref>. In the case of repetitive structures studied in accelerator physics, the coefficients manifest themselves in the form of tune shifts and resonances and potentially limit the stability of the motion.

Reference-contexts: In the case of repetitive structures studied in accelerator physics, the coefficients manifest themselves in the form of tune shifts and resonances and potentially limit the stability of the motion. Using methods of normal form theory that allow a rigorous analysis of the repetitive properties of weakly nonlinear systems <ref> [5] </ref>, many important questions regarding the long-term behavior can be analyzed in a very clean way. The methods are applied 1 for the actual design for new accelerators, including the Superconducting SuperCollider in Texas.
