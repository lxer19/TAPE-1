Reference-contexts: Using primitives somewhat reminiscent of those in On Binding (Chomsky 1980), this theory derives Specified Subject Conditions (SSCs) from competition along two dimensions: Locality and (inflectional) Prominence <ref> (based on Burzio 1992) </ref>. Categories compete, not for the semantic role of antecedent, but for membership in an abstract (syntactic, autonomous) dependency, the main privilege of which is the ability to control deletion of another categorys phi-features under referential identity ( anaphorization ).

Reference-contexts: A related but potentially more general approach to Relativized Minimality effects 20 aimed specifically at cases usually handled with the Binding Theory is developed in Wilson 1995.

Reference-contexts: A grammatical framework for formalizing such comparative principles is provided by Optimality Theory (OT; Prince & Smolensky 1991, 1993), and our goal in this work is to explore the explanatory power of general comparative constraints in syntax like Shortest Link <ref> (e.g., Chomsky 1992) </ref> when they are formalized within OT.

Reference-contexts: interaction of violable constraints on foci, topics, economy of movement, and scope. 25 Kikuyu (SVO) offers the added complication of optionality: the in situ vs. fronting alternation in wh questions is essentially the same as in Lango, except that nonsubjects can optionally be fronted as well as appear in situ <ref> (Clements, Mailing, and Zaenen, 1983) </ref>.

Our basic constraint, then, is simply: R EF : Chains are referential.

Reference-contexts: Extraction out of all kinds of islands ( wh - islands, adjunct clauses, sentential subjects, and relative clauses) is grammatical in Palauan (VOS), both in its fronting and its in situ wh strategies <ref> (Georgopoulos 1985, 1991) </ref>. <p> indexing or LF Legendre, Smolensky, & Wilson Faithfulness and Minimal Links in wh-Chains We thank Peter Cole for clarification on Quechua. 23 29 interpretation for Ancash Quechua in situ wh questions (Cole and Hermon, 1994) as opposed to LF wh movement in Chinese, and base-generation of wh fronting in Palauan <ref> (Georgopoulos, 1985, 1991) </ref> as opposed to s-structure movement in English.

Reference-contexts: Faithfulness to the Index is inviolable in such an MP approach <ref> (as in OT approaches like that of Grimshaw 1993) </ref>; for us, such faithfulness is crucially violable. <p> equally important part of the Index: the structure which determines which derivations compete.) 6 For studying s-structures, an attractive hypothesis is that the Index consists of a pair [d-structure, LF-structure]; that is, two s-structures compete if and only if they derive from the same d-structure and yield the same LF <ref> (Grimshaw, 1993) </ref>. The interpretive information of d-structure and LF are fixed among competitors; syntax determines the s-structure realization of this interpretive information. 7 This attractive approach brings us to our first problem, that of Language-Particular Ineffability .

Reference-contexts: indicate the coverage provided by this this ranking (6.2), and finally encapsulate the ranking (Prince & Smolensky 1993:8.4) to give better insight into its predictions. 6.1 Deducing the Ranking For starters, we have: (11) Undominated constraints: S ELECT ; G OV (t) G OV (t) is relevant to intermediate traces <ref> (responsible for CED-like effects, Huang 1982) </ref>, and to the traces at the foot of topicalization chains.

Reference-contexts: If P ARSE S COPE is subordinated to F ILL , extractions from wh islands cannot involve a resumptive element, while extractions from [wh] complements can. Such a pattern is found in the (SVO) Kru language Vata <ref> (Koopman and Sportiche, 1986) </ref>: subjects can be extracted from a [wh] complement if the gap is filled with a resumptive pronoun but they cannot be extracted out of a wh island, with or without a resumptive pronoun. Objects can be extracted out of both contexts but forbid the resumptive pronoun.

Reference-contexts: Language Study I: Chinese We have used the constraints above to analyze in detail the extraction patterns of Chinese, English and Bulgarian. Here, we present a portion of the Chinese analysis; in Section 7 we very briefly summarize the English analysis; space does not permit discussion of Bulgarian <ref> (but see Legendre, et al. 1995, Legendre & Smolensky in progress) </ref>. <p> Language Study II: English Space constraints demand that we discuss only a few points from our extended analysis of English wh extractions <ref> (see Legendre et al. 1995, Legendre & Smolensky in progress) </ref>. <p> the two languages; in both languages extractability is sensitive to referentiality, though what counts as referential elements differs in the two languages: in Chinese, these include arguments and some adjuncts (corresponding to when, where , instrumental how and purpose why; Tsai, 1994), while in Bulgarian they include D (iscourse)-linked arguments. <ref> (See further discussion in Legendre et al, 1995) </ref>. Our ranking for Bulgarian is the same as for Chinese, stated over the encapsulated constraints. But the necessary encapsulation is slightly different: (21) a. <p> Bulgarian: *LM / [ B AR &gt;&gt; B AR ] *SM / [B AR &gt;&gt; B AR &gt;&gt; B AR ] 5 4 3 2 1 Because clausal complements are CPs in Bulgarian (obligatory complementizer) and IPs in Chinese <ref> (see Legendre et al. 1995 for evidence) </ref>, superficially comparable chains differ by one barrier across the two languages. A second piece of evidence is provided by Iraqi Arabic (SVO).

Reference-contexts: AR is possible in Tagalog, in long extractions, where 2 competitors fare worse, i.e. violate B AR or violate B AR more than once. 3 2 Another language in which subordination of G OV (t) is proposed is Hindi: Hindi lacks that -t effects despite the presence of a complementizer <ref> (Mahajan, 1990) </ref>. In our terms, this shows that G OV (t) is ranked lower than P ARSE (wh). 8.3.

Reference-contexts: And in fact it is, in a very interesting way: extraction of an embedded subject requires the embedded verb and the matrix verb to carry AT and TT morphology respectively, while extraction of an embedded object requires TT morphology on both matrix and embedded verbs <ref> (based on data from Nakamura, 1994) </ref>. The verbal morphology reveals the successive cyclic character of the extraction (via the topic position), with matrix TT morphology corresponding to the topicalization of the entire embedded clause (bringing it closer to the landing site of the wh phrase).

Our basic constraint, then, is simply: R EF : Chains are referential. Cross-linguistically, the interaction between R EF and M IN L INK has a general character nicely illustrated by Chinese: a. Non-referential chains are good, if short b. Long chains are good, if referential c.

Reference-contexts: high degree of independence is thus predicted between these two aspects of wh chains. (But not complete independence, however; e.g., G OV (t)s effects on extractability depend on whether there are traces at the foot of wh chains: the fronting/in situ/resumptive strategy.) One piece of evidence is provided by Bulgarian <ref> (Rudin, 1985, 1988) </ref>, whose wh strategy is exactly opposite of Chineses: Bulgarian (SVO) fronts all wh phrases.

Universal constraint sub-hierarchies like M IN L INK were developed in Prince & Smolensky 1993; their importance for UG was argued on the basis of the roles of the sonority hierarchy in syllabification and Coronal unmarkedness in segmental phonology <ref> (the latter argument was extended in Smolensky 1993) </ref>.
