Abstract: In this paper we present algorithms for flow admission control at an EDF link scheduler when the flows are characterized by peak rate, average rate and burst size. We show that the algorithms have very low computational complexity and are easily applicable in practice. The complexity can be further decreased by introducing the notion of discrete admission control. We evaluate the penalty in efficiency incurred by the discretization of the EDF admission control. We find that this efficiency degradation can be made arbitrarily small and is acceptable even for a small number of discretization points. fl This material is based upon work supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant NCR-95-08274 and CDA-95-02639.

Reference-contexts: Several flow setup protocols that convey end-to-end user delay requirements to the links have been proposed and are in the process of standardization; these include RSVP [2] for the Internet, and ATM signaling <ref> [1] </ref> for ATM networks. The problem of providing delay guarantees at a network link is the focus of much current research. Much of this work focuses on the issue of packet scheduling determining the order in which queued packets are forwarded over outgoing links at switches and routers. <p> We take advantage of the particular flow characterization (peak rate, mean rate and 2 burst size) proposed in the emerging standards of Internet Integrated Services [14] and ATM signaling <ref> [1] </ref>. We find that our algorithms have low complexity (O (N )) where N is the number of admitted flows at the EDF scheduler at the moment of the algorithm's invocation. <p> Consider a source that wishes to establish a flow f to a destination using ATM signaling. It sends a SETUP message to the destination, including information such as the flow's traffic characteristics (maximum cell rate, sustained cell rate, maximum burst size <ref> [1] </ref>), and the maximum allowable end-to-end delay, d fm . At each link l along the path from source to destination, the minimum delay that link l can guarantee to f , d fl is computed, and added to d fc , the cumulative delay included in the SETUP message. <p> the flow setup protocols described earlier. 3 EDF Admission Control for (C; ; ) Token Bucket Flows 3.1 Analysis of EDF Schedulability Conditions Let us consider flows that are characterized by the following type of envelope, referred to as (C; ; ) envelope, used in both IP [14] and ATM <ref> [1] </ref> networks: A fl 8 &gt; &gt; : C i t 0 t &lt; a i (3) where * C i is the peak rate of the flow (bits/second); * i 0 is the maximum burst size at time 0 (bits); 5 * i &gt; 0 is the average rate of <p> The characteristics of the flows to be serviced at this link are generated randomly and are intended to cover a wide range of traffic patterns. In our simulations we take = 10 p Kb=s where p is uniformly distributed in <ref> [1; 3] </ref>, that makes cover the range [10Kb=s; 1M b=s]. From multiple video and audio traces we have observed that both C and are correlated with . In our simulations we take C = q fl Kb=s, where q is uniformly distributed in [2; 5].

Reference-contexts: Also, Rate-Controlled EDF [15] was proven to outperform GPS in providing end-to-end delay guarantees in a network <ref> [7] </ref>. In the present work we adopt the Rate-Controlled model where the EDF scheduler of each link has an independent contribution to the end-to-end delay guarantee of a flow. The end-to-end admission control is thus reduced to EDF schedulability verifications at each link.

Recently, a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for flow schedulability has been put forward by <ref> [11, 6] </ref>, using a general characterization of flows. The fact that EDF is an optimal scheduling policy and that there exist necessary and sufficient conditions for schedulability makes EDF an attractive choice for providing delay guarantees for real-time flows. <p> This issue has been successfully addressed in [10], where the search time is brought to constant (O (1)) time by discretizing the range of packet deadline values. The second issue is that, although the EDF schedulability conditions in <ref> [11] </ref> can be expressed simply, the algorithms to perform these schedulability tests can be computationally complex, or, in the general case, require an unbounded number of values that must be checked. <p> In the following we examine how to provide these capabilities in the case of EDF scheduling. <ref> [11, 6] </ref> have given flow schedulability conditions at EDF schedulers for flows characterized by envelopes, or rate-controlling functions. <p> Note that, in order to provide a better intuition, in this paper we measure the traffic in number of data units (bits) rather than transmission time (seconds), the latter being used in <ref> [11] </ref>. Let N = f1; 2; ::N g be a set of flows, where flow i 2 N is characterized by the envelope A fl i . The stability condition for a work-conserving scheduler (thus including the EDF scheduler) is ([11], eq. (5)): lim P i (t) &lt; 1 (1) where <p> EDF scheduler) is (<ref> [11] </ref>, eq. (5)): lim P i (t) &lt; 1 (1) where c is the constant rate of the link (bits/second). Assuming a preemptive EDF scheduler or negligible packet sizes (as in the case of ATM cells) we give the following variant of the schedulability condition proposed in [11] for the set N of flows: Theorem 1 (Liebeherr,Wrege,Ferrari 1994) Let N be a set of flows, stable by (1), where flow i 2 N is characterized by the envelope A fl i and has a maximum packet delay of d i . <p> The set N is EDF-schedulable if and only if: ct i2N i (t d i ); 8t 0 (2) It is easy to show, following the proof in <ref> [11] </ref>, that the above Theorem (having eq. (2) 8t 0) is equivalent to Theorem 1 of [11] (having eq. (2) 8 0 t B 1 , where B 1 is the maximum length of a busy period). <p> The set N is EDF-schedulable if and only if: ct i2N i (t d i ); 8t 0 (2) It is easy to show, following the proof in <ref> [11] </ref>, that the above Theorem (having eq. (2) 8t 0) is equivalent to Theorem 1 of [11] (having eq. (2) 8 0 t B 1 , where B 1 is the maximum length of a busy period). We say that the set (A fl i ; d i ) i2N is schedulable if (1) and (2) are satisfied. [11] provides schedulability conditions, but does not provide algorithms <p> 8t 0) is equivalent to Theorem 1 of <ref> [11] </ref> (having eq.

[11] provides schedulability conditions, but does not provide algorithms for schedulability testing. In the following we show that EDF schedulers have the capability to support the flow setup protocols described earlier. <p> We applied the admission control conditions put forward by <ref> [11] </ref> to flows characterized by peak rate, mean rate and burst size. We developed a first set of algorithms with a computation complexity of O (N ), where N is the number of flows admitted in the EDF scheduler at the time of algorithm invocation.
