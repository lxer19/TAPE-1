Abstract: In this paper we study a fluid flow model of an ATM traffic shaper. In particular, we are interested in the relation between the buffer capacity of the shaper, the shaper rate, the cell arrival process and the cell loss probability. The main conclusion of the paper is that cell loss probabilities are very sensitive to several traffic characteristics of the arrival process, like e.g. the squared coefficient of variation of the durations of on-periods in an on-off arrival process.

Reference-contexts: Different approaches for modelling ATM systems are used in the literature (see Roberts [6]), in particular discrete-time queueing models (see e.g. Gravey, Louvion and Boyer [2]) and fluid flow models (see e.g. Anick, Mitra and Sondhi <ref> [1] </ref>). In this paper we have chosen to use a fluid flow approach. This approach enables us to derive expressions for the cell loss probability in the case that the arrival process is given by an N-state Markov process. <p> and C L for the total expected cycle time and total expected loss in a cycle, the loss fraction ff is obtained from ff D C T i i 4 2.3 Related literature In the context of communication systems, the fluid flow model was introduced by Anick, Mitra and Sondhi <ref> [1] </ref>. They considered a system with an infinite buffer in which the arrival process consists of a superposition of identical on-off sources with exponential on-times and off-times. Later on, Kosten [4] extended the arrival process to a general Markov-driven source.

Reference-contexts: For a more precise description of an MMBP and the analysis of an MMBP/D/1/K queue, we refer to Guillemin, Boyer and Dupuis <ref> [3] </ref>. mean length phase 1 = 10, mean length phase 2 = 30. For three different cases the results of the comparison are shown in Figure 6.

Later on, Kosten <ref> [4] </ref> extended the arrival process to a general Markov-driven source. In the work of Mitra [5], the model of Anick, Mitra and Sondhi is extended in the way that also the service process can be in different states (and hence you can have different service rates).

Furthermore, both the finite and the infinite buffer case are considered. <p> In practical applications the length of the on-period corresponds to the number of cells in a packet. From Figure 2 we conclude that the cell loss decreases exponentially when the buffer size increases (cf. Mitra <ref> [5] </ref>). Furthermore we conclude that the squared coefficient of variation of the on-periods has a large impact on the cell loss.

Reference-contexts: Obviously, to minimize costs, the VPC bandwidth should be chosen as low as possible under the condition that the resulting cell loss probability is smaller than a certain predefined value and the cell delay is acceptable. Different approaches for modelling ATM systems are used in the literature (see Roberts <ref> [6] </ref>), in particular discrete-time queueing models (see e.g. Gravey, Louvion and Boyer [2]) and fluid flow models (see e.g. Anick, Mitra and Sondhi [1]). In this paper we have chosen to use a fluid flow approach.

Reference-contexts: Finally, when c 2 &gt; 1 we choose a hyper-exponential distribution with balanced means for the duration of the on-periods (see e.g. page 399 of Tijms <ref> [7] </ref>). Once again, the arrival process consists of three states. The arrival rates satisfy 1 D 0 and 2 D 3 D 1. The transition rates 23 and 32 are equal to 0.

The state of the system is a pair .i; x/ with i the state of the arrival process and x the buffer content. In order to obtain the overflow (loss) fraction we look at the overflow in a renewal cycle.
