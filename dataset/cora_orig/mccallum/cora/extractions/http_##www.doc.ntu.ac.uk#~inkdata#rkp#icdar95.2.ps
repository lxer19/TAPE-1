Title: Abstract  
Abstract: This paper concentrates on combination of results of multiple recognizers at the word level. Two approaches are presented: word list merging and linear combination. Word list merging requires no knowledge about the individual recognizers. The linear combination is an attempt to exploit the information about characteristics of individual recognizers. This appears more complex than in the case of combination of results at the character level. Recognition of words is inuenced by more factors, which can independently affect the recognition process. Characterisation of recognizers, used for word level combination, is more complex and requires more than a simple consideration of recognition success and failure. The concept of handwriting data characterisation is defined. A number of handwriting characteristics are extracted and used to guide the combination process. The choice of characteristics is made in the context of recognition methods used. No attempt at general characterisation of handwriting is made. Relationship between handwriting characteristics and recognition results is observed and used to obtain characteristics of individual recognizers. Results of the two combination methods are reported and compared with another frequently used method for results combination, the Borda count. Keywords: results combination, handwriting characterisation, recognizer characterisation, linear combination, word list merging, online cursive script recognition

Moreover, there are many more factors inuencing the recognition of entire words. Therefore, it is believed to be more beneficial to identify factors inuencing the recognition process of individual recognizers and characterise the recognizers in terms of these identified factors as presented in this paper.
