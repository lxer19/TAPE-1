Abstract: Manipulators with large numbers of degrees of freedom, from the human hand to the trunk of an elephant, are common in the biological world. These freedoms allow highly flexible and robust performance of complex tasks. However, progress in developing and controlling artificial high-degree-of freedom manipulators has been slow. The main problem is that traditional robotics has focussed on the solution of systems of kinematic equations where there is a unique solution. Such approaches tend not to generalize well to situations with a high-dimensional solution space, and controlling redundant systems has acquired a reputation as a hard problem. However, this need not be the case. In this paper, we describe a behavioral method for using extra degrees of freedom to simplify rather than complicate manipulation problems, while at the same time obtaining more flexibility than would be available with a simpler system. The method is developed in the context of a high DOF robot hand, but it has the potential to generalize to other sorts of manipulators. The basic idea is based on the observation that, for a particular task, using a custom-designed fitting can greatly simplify the control problem. Using a wrench sized for a particular nut is an extreme example. We use the extra degrees of freedom to dynamically configure or "tailor" the manipulator to match the particular object and task at hand. This creates a virtual tool. The tailoring is accomplished by imposing low-level, task-specific constraints on the degrees of freedom. These constraints are selected dynamically from a large set of potential constraints in response to the demands of the current task. The process of smoothly transitioning from one virtual tool to another in the course of task execution is referred to as morphing. We apply the technique to the control of a 16-DOF Utah/MIT hand, and perform fine manipulations on a range of objects using virtual tools that are dynamically instantiated on the basis of sensory information.

Reference-contexts: The idea of a virtual tool is a generalization of some techniques that have been described previously for dealing with more specific situations. A good example is the notion of virtual fingers introduced by Arbib et al. <ref> [Arbib et al., 1985] </ref>. A grasp involves the use of virtual fingers, which are composed of one or more real fingers working together to perform a task.

Reference-contexts: There has been a certain amount of work on the control of particular redundant manipulators, principally robot hands and snake-like devices. The redundant nature of hands has been addressed by Iberall et al. [Iberall et al., 1988; Iberall, 1987], Bekey et al. <ref> [Bekey et al., 1993] </ref>,[Caselli et al., 1993], and Stansfield [Stansfield, 1991], all of whom have used heuristics derived from human grasping to choose among several possible grasps. <p> A number of approaches are essentially based on heuristics derived from observation of human hands. Lyons [Lyons, 1985] defined heuristic measures of firmness and precision and matched them to the specification of a task. Bekey et al. <ref> [Bekey et al., 1993] </ref> developed a knowledge-based grasp planner for the University of Belgrade/USC robotic hand. This system is an advance over previous ones in that it chooses grasp parameters as well as grasp types, and thus is not limited to a small set of pre-stored positions.

Reference-contexts: In behavioral robotics <ref> [Maes, 1992; Brooks, 1986; Brooks, 1991] </ref>, the robotic system is viewed as always being engaged in some particular task or behavior. <p> The symbolic modules encode heuristic knowledge along with simple geometric reasoning, and the neural networks modules establish the more complex relationships between the geometric attributes of the object and the hand kinematics. There have also been a number of behavior-based approaches inspired by Brooks' sub-sumption architecture <ref> [Brooks, 1986] </ref>. Murphy et al. [Murphy et al., 1993] presented a simple behavior-based approach to grasping using a three-fingered manipulator. Matsui et al. [Matsui et al., 1992] have used a subsumption architecture for the control of the Hyuma robotic hand.

Reference-contexts: It was also difficult to determine the limits of uncertainty. From the theoretical standpoint, it was shown that the general problem of motion planning with uncertainty is NEXP-Hard <ref> [Canny, 1987] </ref>. Thus, any algorithm for motion planning that guarantees an optimal solution must be hopelessly slow or assume a complete and correct model. The compliance inherent in some dextrous manipulators allows the use of sparser models [Pook and Ballard, 1992].

Reference-contexts: Joint motions can then be determined so that subtasks with lower priority can be performed utilizing redundancy freedoms of subtasks with higher priority [Nakamura et al., 1987; Yoshikawa, 1990].

Reference-contexts: A novel approach to the problem of the complexity of the optimization techniques typically used for redundancy resolution was described by Davidor, who proposed using genetic algorithms. <ref> [Davidor, 1991] </ref>. This paper noted that, in the interests of efficiency, most other approaches deal only with instantaneous positions and yield suboptimal results over whole trajectories. The standard techniques also have trouble with local minima and non-differentiable objective functions. Genetic algorithms offer a potential solution.

Reference-contexts: Some work has been done in robotic manipulation using machine learning techniques. In general, these approaches have dealt with simple tasks such as grasping with parallel jaw grippers and simple manipulation strategies not involving complex manipulators. Dunn and Segen <ref> [Dunn and Segen, 1988] </ref> presented a robotic system that learns how to grasp 9 objects under visual control by trial and error. Working grasps are saved along with the object's shape. The system generalizes to different positions and orientations but not to sizes.

Reference-contexts: These studies make almost exclusive use of classical deterministic techniques of statics, kinematics, dynamics and control theory. It is generally assumed that complete models of the geometry of the hand and the grasped object are available. Early work by Hanfusa and Asada <ref> [Hanafusa and Asada, 1982] </ref> showed that an elastic grasp was stable when the total energy stored in the elastic fingers was (locally) minimal with respect to small translations and rotations of the grasped object. <p> Assuming correctness of the model, the predictions can be 8 proven to be correct and complete [Mason, 1984]. Latombe gives a good overview of this method as well as some of its subsequent modifications [Latombe, 1989]. These theoretical works were, with the exception of <ref> [Hanafusa and Asada, 1982] </ref>, not accompanied by experimental results to test the validity of the assumptions they made. It is therefore, hard to tell whether they have any practical applicability.

Hirose <ref> [Hirose, 1993] </ref> mentions the idea of using the additional degrees of freedom in a snake to allow the same mechanism to work as a gripper, manipulator or locomotor.

Reference-contexts: Another approach is to maximize the distance between the manipulator and various obstacles while still satisfying the goal conditions [Maciejewski and Klein, 1985; Yoshikawa, 1990]. An optimization method based on joint torques is described by Holler-bach and Suh <ref> [Hollerbach and Suh, 1985] </ref>. A few authors have discussed other aspects of redundant manipulators. Maciejewski [Maciejewski, 1990] discusses the design of redundant manipulators that can tolerate certain joint failures (e.g. a frozen joint).

In their system, one or two fingers guide the movement of the object while the others keep the grasping force within a safety range.

Reference-contexts: There have also been a number of behavior-based approaches inspired by Brooks' sub-sumption architecture [Brooks, 1986].

Reference-contexts: One idea is to divide a task into subtasks according to priorities. Joint motions can then be determined so that subtasks with lower priority can be performed utilizing redundancy freedoms of subtasks with higher priority <ref> [Nakamura et al., 1987; Yoshikawa, 1990] </ref>. Other authors have discussed combining multiple criteria by linear means [Cleary, 1990; Pamanes and Zeghloul, 1991], and probabilistically [McGhee et al., 1994]. There has been a certain amount of work on the control of particular redundant manipulators, principally robot hands and snake-like devices.

Reference-contexts: Motion primitives can be added, subtracted, reversed and scaled. Although the combination rules are not mathematically correct, the compliance of the hand compensated for the inaccurate trajectories, and experimental results using the Utah/MIT hand showed this approach to work reasonably well. Nelson <ref> [Nelson] </ref> extended Speeter's approach by storing separate motor primitives for large and small objects and computing the appropriate primitives at run time by detecting the size of the object being manipulated and linearly interpolating the stored primitives. 4 Virtual Tools for the Utah/MIT Hand In this section we describe the use

Reference-contexts: Although, due to non-zero finger size and other affects, the assumption of fixed contact points is not strictly correct, our experimental results show that the compliance of the Utah/MIT hand compensates for the errors introduced by the use of this assumption. Somewhat similar approaches have been suggested in <ref> [Okada, 1982] </ref> and [Salisbury et al., 1989]. In more detail, the formulation is as follows.

Reference-contexts: Rus [Rus, 1993] presented a linear time algorithm for rotating a polygon in the frictionless limit by sliding one finger along the edge of the polygon, and Omata <ref> [Omata, 1994] </ref> presented an algorithm for two dimensional object reorientation using a sequence of regrasps. Some approaches that deal with uncertainty in manipulation tasks have also been proposed. One of the first was published by Lozano-Perez, Mason and Taylor in 1984 [Lozano-Perez et al., 1984].

Other authors have discussed combining multiple criteria by linear means <ref> [Cleary, 1990; Pamanes and Zeghloul, 1991] </ref>, and probabilistically [McGhee et al., 1994].

Reference-contexts: Thus, any algorithm for motion planning that guarantees an optimal solution must be hopelessly slow or assume a complete and correct model. The compliance inherent in some dextrous manipulators allows the use of sparser models <ref> [Pook and Ballard, 1992] </ref>. By using such models, some of the problems associated with obtaining and utilizing complete models can be avoided. Such models have only recently become popular but their use is increasing, as they seem to work for the control of real devices.

Reference-contexts: This allowed him to express and analyze the complex behavior of a machine with six legs in relatively simple terms. Raibert <ref> [Raibert, 1986] </ref> used the virtual leg concept to derive two and four legged gaits from algorithms originally designed for a one-legged hoping robot. He observed that in biped gaits at any given time only one leg is providing support while the other is elevated and out of the way.

Reference-contexts: Similar observations have been made before. 3 Dextrous Manipulation as a Testbed In the past few years dextrous robot hands, such as the 9DOF Salisbury hand <ref> [Salisbury, 1982] </ref>, and the 16DOF Utah/MIT hand [Jacobsen, 1984; Jacobsen et al., 1986], have become increasingly available in research environments. This has sparked a considerable amount of research on grasping and dextrous manipulation. <p> Salisbury investigated grasping models with and without friction using several types of contact between a finger and an object <ref> [Salisbury, 1982] </ref>. Later, Trinkle, Abel and Paul [Trinkle et al., 1988] studied the mathematics of frictionless grasping. They presented a method for grasping a polygonal object with a two-dimensional hand composed of a palm and two hinged fingers.

Reference-contexts: Also, their compliance and redundancy aid in overcoming uncertainties and errors 7 in the modeling. These same properties, however, make programming dextrous hands to perform useful tasks a challenging task. Manipulation with multiple cooperating fingers requires more sophisticated sensing, feedback, and planning than are found in conventional robot controllers <ref> [Salisbury et al., 1989] </ref>. When an object is manipulated with a parallel jaw gripper, the inflexibility of manipulator generally forces the programmer to provide accurate models of the objects to be grasped or manipulated. <p> Somewhat similar approaches have been suggested in [Okada, 1982] and <ref> [Salisbury et al., 1989] </ref>. In more detail, the formulation is as follows.

Reference-contexts: This decoupling of the degrees of freedom greatly reduces the dimensionality of the parameter space of the hand for the task. Another approach, pioneered by Speeter <ref> [Speeter, 1991] </ref>, uses motor primitives, which are sequences of joint position changes encoding small functional motions of the hand. Motion primitives can be added, subtracted, reversed and scaled.

Reference-contexts: The redundant nature of hands has been addressed by Iberall et al. [Iberall et al., 1988; Iberall, 1987], Bekey et al. [Bekey et al., 1993],[Caselli et al., 1993], and Stansfield <ref> [Stansfield, 1991] </ref>, all of whom have used heuristics derived from human grasping to choose among several possible grasps.

Reference-contexts: Iberall [Iberall, 1987] shows how the hand can be used as essentially three different grippers by changing the mapping of virtual fingers to real fingers. Sutherland and Ullner <ref> [Sutherland and Ullner, 1984] </ref> introduced the concept of virtual 4 legs for a six-legged walking robot. He observed that when two-legs act in unison, they can be thought of as a functionally equivalent virtual leg.

Reference-contexts: Salisbury investigated grasping models with and without friction using several types of contact between a finger and an object [Salisbury, 1982].

Reference-contexts: An early formulation of the inverse kinematics of a redundant manipulator as an optimization problem was given by Liegeois [Liegeois, 1977]. The basic criterion was to keep the joint variables far from their physical limits. A somewhat different quality measure was described by Yoshikawa <ref> [Yoshikawa, 1990] </ref>, who proposed the square root of the determinant of JJ T , where J is the Jacobian matrix, as a quantitative measure of the "manipulability" of a manipulator (redundant or not) in a given configuration. <p> Another approach is to maximize the distance between the manipulator and various obstacles while still satisfying the goal conditions <ref> [Maciejewski and Klein, 1985; Yoshikawa, 1990] </ref>. An optimization method based on joint torques is described by Holler-bach and Suh [Hollerbach and Suh, 1985]. A few authors have discussed other aspects of redundant manipulators. <p> One idea is to divide a task into subtasks according to priorities. Joint motions can then be determined so that subtasks with lower priority can be performed utilizing redundancy freedoms of subtasks with higher priority <ref> [Nakamura et al., 1987; Yoshikawa, 1990] </ref>.
