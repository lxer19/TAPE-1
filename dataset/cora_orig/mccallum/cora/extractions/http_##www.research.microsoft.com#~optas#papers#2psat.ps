Abstract: Rigorous Results for Random (2 + p)-SAT Abstract Consider random k-SAT instances with rn clauses over n variables, where each clause is chosen uniformly and independently from the set of all clauses of length k. It is widely believed that for all k 2 there exists r k such that random instances are almost surely satisfiable for r &lt; r k and almost surely unsatisfiable for r &gt; r k . For k = 2 this was proven to be true in [6, 13, 9] and moreover it was shown that r 2 = 1. For k &gt; 2, only lower and upper bounds are known for almost sure (un)satisfiability. Experimental evidence suggests that the value of r 3 is around 4:2. As an attempt to "interpolate" between k = 2 and k = 3 the (2 + p)-SAT model was proposed in [22]. In this model, as in random k-SAT, there are rn clauses over n variables, but now prn clauses have length 3 and (1 p)rn have length 2, where p 2 [0; 1]. In this paper we prove the first rigorous results for (2 + p)-SAT. Our results provide a tight "envelope" for the heuristic results of [22]. Among others, we show that if p 2=5 then a random instance of (2 + p)-SAT is almost surely (un)satisfiable if r is smaller (greater) than 1=(1 p), i.e., for p 2=5 the clauses of length 3 are "irrelevant".

Although the step is quite intuitive, the justification of the fact that the chain a.s. stays "close" to its mean path, and hence the solutions of the differential equations provide a good approximation, is highly nontrivial. <p> The unique solution of differential equations/boundary conditions (5),(6) of lemma 4 is c 3 (x) = rp (1 x) 3 ; Combining (7),(8) and lemma 5 we get that for a random instance of (2 + p)-SAT with rn clauses, uc succeeds with positive probability if for all x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, 1=2r (3px 2p + 2)(1 x) &lt; 1 : (9) For p 2=5, the left hand side of (9) is non-increasing with x and hence (9) holds iff r &lt; 1 p For p &gt; 2=5, the left hand side of (9) is unimodal for x 2 [0; 1], <p> 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, 1=2r (3px 2p + 2)(1 x) &lt; 1 : (9) For p 2=5, the left hand side of (9) is non-increasing with x and hence (9) holds iff r &lt; 1 p For p &gt; 2=5, the left hand side of (9) is unimodal for x 2 [0; 1], the unique maximum occurring for x = (5p 2)=6. Substituting this value of x in (9) we get r &lt; (p + 2) 2 : This completes the proof of theorem 1.

Reference-contexts: Chao and Franco <ref> [4] </ref> analyzed the Unit Clause (uc) algorithm for 3-SAT, with and without a "majority" rule, and showed that for r &lt; 2:9 and r &lt; 8=3, respectively, it finds a satisfying truth assignment (succeeds) with positive probability. <p> Hence, the values of <ref> [4] </ref> are in fact lower bounds for r 3 , though slightly superseded by the value provided in [12]. 1.1 Replica theory and motivation Our previous discussion pertains to mathematical (rigorous) results. <p> To establish the latter, we will in fact show how to find a satisfying truth assignment, in polynomial time, with probability * &gt; 0. We will use the Unit Clause (uc) algorithm which was introduced and analyzed for random 3-SAT by Chao and Franco <ref> [4] </ref>. Solely for the sake of self-containment, we present the algorithm below. The algorithm makes n iterations, setting permanently one variable in each one. In the following, "at time t" will mean after t such iterations have been performed (i.e., after t variables have been set). <p> On the other hand, if this never happens, i.e., C 0 (n) = ;, then uc finds a satisfying truth assignment, in which case we say that it succeeds. Let C i (t) = jC i (t)j. Lemmata 2,3, below, were proven in <ref> [4] </ref> and regard the behavior of uc while processing a random instance of 3-SAT. We will provide the intuition behind the proof for both of them, making it easy to see that they generalize to (2 + p)-SAT. 6 Lemma 2 [4] Let V (t) denote the set of unset variables <p> Lemmata 2,3, below, were proven in <ref> [4] </ref> and regard the behavior of uc while processing a random instance of 3-SAT.

The following lemma follows directly from the main theorem of [25], lemmata 2,3 and observation 1. A similar, but less precise, statement for 3-SAT (p = 1) appears in <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> Lemma 5 <ref> [4] </ref> Let U (t) be the random variable defined as the number of clauses that shrink to unit length, during step t.

Reference-contexts: They also show, in statistical mechanics terminology, that for k = 2 the phase transition from a.s. satisfiability to a.s. unsatisfiability is of "second order", but for k &gt; 2 it is of "first order". In a subsequent paper by Monasson et al. <ref> [22] </ref>, in view of this last statement, it is conjectured that the fact that k-SAT is in P for k = 2 and NP-complete for k &gt; 2, is "no accident". <p> Thus, p = 0 corresponds to random 2-SAT, while p = 1 corresponds to random 3-SAT. In <ref> [22] </ref> the replica method was used to derive predictions for the critical value, r p , at which the transition from a.s. satisfiability to a.s. unsatisfiability takes place. <p> Since for a random instance of (2 + p)-SAT to be satisfiable its 2-SAT subformula must be satisfiable and r 2 = 1, we have r p &lt; 1=(1 p). Rather remarkably, it is predicted in <ref> [22] </ref> that for p &lt; 0:413:::, 1=(1 p) is also a lower bound for r p and hence r p = 1=(1 p). In other words, for p 2 [0; 0:413::), (2 + p)-SAT "behaves like 2-SAT". In this paper we prove this assertion for p 0:4. <p> In this paper we prove this assertion for p 0:4. We show that for p 2 [0; 2=5], r p is indeed 1=(1 p), the threshold for the 2-SAT subformula to be satisfiable. For p &gt; 0:413:: the predicted value <ref> [22] </ref> of r p is less than 1=(1 p) and the phase transition changes from second order to first order, i.e., (2 + p)-SAT "behaves like 3-SAT" for p 2 (0:413:::; 1].
