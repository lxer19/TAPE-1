Abstract: A human diver in the air is an example of a nonholo-nomic system with drift. In this paper, we present a dynamic model of the diver performing planar dives and examine a simple learning approach to the control problem. Finally, we present a proposal for a general, hierarchical, learning controller for systems with many degrees of freedom.

Reference-contexts: No continuous trajectories need to be stored. In order to adapt to external forces, though, the system needs another schema in parallel with the pulse generator, which would learn the relationship between the state of the system and the external joint torques (see [15]; <ref> [1] </ref>). For the diving problem, this will be essential for dealing with the centripetal forces on the legs and arms while somersaulting. To stabilize the system with respect to disturbances, some feedback is also required.

In the real world, however, systems with drift are common. For example, bodies in free-fall with some initial angular momentum have drift. One instance of this kind of system is a human diver.

Reference-contexts: This method of steering with si-nusoids has also been used for other nonholonomic systems such as cars with trailers and firetrucks <ref> [4] </ref>. These systems were all drift-free, however; the drift in the diver system complicated this approach considerably. Methods that have been developed for steering left-invariant control systems cannot be applied, since the diver system is not left-invariant.

Reference-contexts: He can also convert some of his somersaulting motion into twisting about the body's long axis by performing a "throwing" maneuver with his arms which shifts the body's angular velocity vector so that it is no longer aligned with the angular momentum. Frohlich <ref> [5] </ref> has done an extensive analysis of the physics of various diving and trampoline maneuvers. A similar problem, though one without drift, is that of the falling cat; the cat must use internal motions to reorient itself before it reaches the ground (see [11]).

Reference-contexts: These networks produce periodic bursting patterns which can be modulated by signals descending from higher levels in the control hierarchy. (For a review, see [7].) Recently, several investigators have found evidence for low-level controllers in fast, goal-directed movements (see, for example, <ref> [6] </ref>). Such a controller would produce a stereotypical fast movement, identifiable by its torque, velocity, and double-or triple-burst EMG profile. Again, the movement could be tuned by descending commands, but the system would only use control signals from a restricted class. <p> Again, the movement could be tuned by descending commands, but the system would only use control signals from a restricted class. In our scenario (which is based on that proposed in <ref> [6] </ref>), the low-level controller for each joint is a pulse generator which produces square activation pulses. The pulses are then filtered, in analogy with the action of the motoneuron pool, to produce A C the learning algorithm. <p> D. 1 with these controls (solid) and with the controls set to zero (dashed). the control torque. The resulting torque is reminiscent both of the double- or triple-burst EMG pattern common in fast movements and of bang-bang control. In the model in <ref> [6] </ref>, the width and height of the pulses are changed in response to changing task requirements. Here, we suggest that the pulse generator is a motor schema in the sense of Schmidt [13].

Reference-contexts: Since the diver is falling while executing the maneuver, there is a pre-determined length of time in which the controls can act. Hodgins has developed finite-state-machine controllers for various systems with constraints of this kind, including acrobatic robots <ref> [8] </ref> and simulations of human diving [18]. This approach combines a detailed planning strategy with rudimentary PD controllers. In this paper, we discuss a simplified, two-dimensional diver model and a learning approach to the associated control problem.

Reference-contexts: In the model in [6], the width and height of the pulses are changed in response to changing task requirements. Here, we suggest that the pulse generator is a motor schema in the sense of Schmidt <ref> [13] </ref>. In this sense, a schema is a learned relationship between the input and required output vectors of the controller.

Reference-contexts: In order to organize the complexity of coordinating the motion of several degrees of freedom, such a controller should be hierarchical. It should be able to generalize from known tasks to new tasks (see, for example, <ref> [15] </ref>). It should also have a compact representation of the learned controls, for efficient storage as well as communication between hierarchical levels. 5.1 Single Joint Controller Our proposed controller, shown schematically in Figure 4, is based on the idea of biological pattern generators. <p> No continuous trajectories need to be stored. In order to adapt to external forces, though, the system needs another schema in parallel with the pulse generator, which would learn the relationship between the state of the system and the external joint torques (see <ref> [15] </ref>; [1]). For the diving problem, this will be essential for dealing with the centripetal forces on the legs and arms while somersaulting. To stabilize the system with respect to disturbances, some feedback is also required.

Reference-contexts: Our initial attempts to control the diver proved unsatisfactory. These included using the dual, Pfaf-fian exterior differential system approach to generate sinusoidal controls. The diver model is an asymmetric version of the planar skater discussed in <ref> [17] </ref>, which (when drift-free) can reorient itself arbitrarily by moving its two arms sinusoidally and out of phase with each other. This method of steering with si-nusoids has also been used for other nonholonomic systems such as cars with trailers and firetrucks [4].
