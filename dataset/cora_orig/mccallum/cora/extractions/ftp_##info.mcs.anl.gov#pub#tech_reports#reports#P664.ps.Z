Abstract: We present a structured interior-point method for the efficient solution of the optimal control problem in model predictive control (MPC). The cost of this approach is linear in the horizon length, compared with cubic growth for a naive approach. We use a discrete Riccati recursion to solve the linear equations efficiently at each iteration of the interior-point method, and show that we can expect this recursion to be numerically stable although it was motivated originally by structural rather than numerical considerations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by solving three process control problems.

Reference-contexts: This observation has been made by numerous authors, in the context of both active set and interior point methods. Glad and Jonson [8] and Arnold et al. <ref> [1] </ref> demonstrate that the factorization of a structured Lagrangian in an optimal control problem with a Bolza objective for an active set framework yields a Riccati recursion. Wright [23, 24], Steinbach [21], and Lim et al. [11] investigate the Bolza control problem in an interior-point framework. <p> We first compute the maximum step length ff aff that can be taken along the affine-scaling direction, as follows: ff aff = arg max fff 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> j (; t) + ff ( aff ; t aff ) 0g: The duality gap aff attained from this full step to the boundary is aff = ( + ff aff ) T (t + t aff )=m: Finally, we set oe = aff 3 The search direction is <p> The distance we move along the direction (26) is defined in terms of the maximum step ff max that can be taken without violating the condition (21b): ff max = arg max fff 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> j (; t) + ff (; t) 0g: The actual steplength ff is chosen to be flff max , where fl is a parameter in the range (0; 1) chosen to ensure that the pairwise products i t i do not become too unbalanced and the improvement in duality <p> The second comment is that we can extend the structured method to nonlinear MPC by applying the approach of this paper to the linear-quadratic subproblems generated by sequential quadratic programming. Wright [23], Arnold et al. <ref> [1] </ref>, and Steinbach [21] all apply this technique to discrete-time optimal control problems. While some theory for nonlinear MPC is available, the questions of robust implementation and suitable formulation of nonlinear MPC have not been resolved. See Mayne [12] for a discussion of the some of the issues.

Reference-contexts: The essential idea in dynamic programming is to work backwards stagewise through the problem. By tackling the optimization problem in stages, one can redice the optimization problem to a series of simpler subproblems. See Berksekas <ref> [2] </ref> for further details concerning dynamic programming. In an analogous manner to dynamic programming, block factorization also exploits the multi-staged nature of the optimization problem.

Reference-contexts: When input and state constraints are not present, MPC with an infinite horizon is simply the well-known linear quadratic regulator problem. Even when constraints are present, the infinite-horizon MPC problem reduces to a linear quadratic regulator after a certain number of stages (see <ref> [3, 18, 22] </ref>) and can therefore be recast as a finite-dimensional quadratic program. Since this quadratic program can be large, however, it is important that algorithms be efficient even for long horizons. Unconstrained linear optimal control problems can be solved by using a discrete Riccati equation. <p> In the second formulation, discussed by Sznaier and Damborg [22], Chmielewski and Manousiouthakis <ref> [3] </ref>, and Scokaert and Rawlings [18], the input after stage N is parameterized with the classical linear quadratic gain K obtained from the solution of the steady-state Riccati equation. <p> A more complete discussion of handling constraints on the infinite horizon is given by Meadows et al. [13]. For a compact, convex set of states, an alternative approach that circumvents having to check for constraint violations is given by Chmielewski and Manousiouthakis <ref> [3] </ref>. By examining the extremal points on the feasible region, they calculate a conservative upper bound on the N required to guarantee that the solution is feasible on the infinite horizon.

Reference-contexts: The approximation for X tends to be conservative, however, since the algorithm is motivated by norm-bounding arguments. A more practical method, given by Gilbert and Tan <ref> [6] </ref>, is to construct an output maximal set. This set provides a priori an upper bound l on number of feasible stages k 2 [N; N + l] necessary to guarantee that all of the subsequent stages k l + N are feasible.

Reference-contexts: We refer to this formulation hereafter as the standard method. Unfortunately, the constraint and Hessian matrices in the reduced problem are generally dense, so the computational cost of solving the problem is proportional to N 3 . Efficient commercial solvers for dense quadratic programs (such as QPSOL <ref> [7] </ref>) can then be applied to the reduced problem. The O (N 3 ) cost of the standard method is unacceptable because the "unconstrained" version of (18) is known to be solvable in O (N ) time by using a Riccati equation or dynamic programming. <p> The reduction in dimension is accompanied by filling in of the constraint matrices and the Hessian of the objective. The resulting problem is solved with the widely used code QPSOL <ref> [7] </ref>, which implements an active set method by using dense linear algebra calculations. We compared these two approaches on three common applications of the model predictive control methodology. 19 -0.1 0 0.1 u U (1) U (2) U (3) U (4) U (5) Example 1: Copolymerization Reactor.
