Title: Polynomial algorithms for finding paths and cycles in quasi-transitive digraphs  
Author: G. Gutin 
Date: March 14, 1997  
Abstract: A digraph D is called quasi-transitive if for any triple x; y; z of distinct vertices of D such that (x; y) and (y; z) are arcs of D there is at least one arc from x to z or from z to x. A minimum path factor of a digraph D is a collection of the minimum number of pairwise vertex disjoint paths covering the vertices of D. J. Bang-Jensen and J. Huang conjectured that there exist polynomial algorithms for the Hamiltonian path and cycle problems for quasi-transitive digraphs. We solve this conjecture by describing polynomial algorithms for finding a minimum path factor and a Hamiltonian cycle (if it exists) in a quasi-transitive digraph.

Reference-contexts: use a decomposition theorem that characterizes quasi-transitive digraphs in a recursive sense [1], characterizations of semicomplete multipartite digraphs containing Hamil-tonian paths [6] and ordinary semicomplete multipartite digraphs having Hamiltonian cycles [7], network flow algorithms [4], and some other results. 2 Terminology and notation The terminology is rather standard, generally following <ref> [3] </ref>. Digraphs are finite, have no loops or multiple arcs. If multiple arcs are allowed we use the term directed multigraph. V (D) and A (D) denote the vertex set and the arc set of a digraph D.
