Reference-contexts: To minimize this risk, both the filter and monitor are placed in a controlled access machine room and the monitor is configured for secure network access. The filter is similarly programmed only to respond to secure filter update requests, which are not routeable. Filter (drawbridge) Chapman <ref> [1] </ref> presented an interesting analysis of the limitations of current filter implementations at the Third UNIX Security Symposium. <p> Note, however, that figure 3 describes just a typical setup; a router is not a necessary component of a drawbridge configuration. Comparison to Other Filtering Methods Chapman <ref> [1] </ref> is an excellent source of information about packet filtering issues. He discusses the concepts behind packet filtering and some of the problems associated with it. He also discusses the problems with current implementations of packet filtering found in some current routing products. <p> as source port or direction Filtering Router Internet Link More Accessible Host Inaccessible Hosts Less Accessible Hosts Rather than repeat that material, it will be assumed that the reader is familiar with packet filtering and a discussion of how drawbridge tries to address some of these problems mentioned by Chap-man <ref> [1] </ref> will be presented. One of the first problems with current packet filtering implementations is that they are difficult to configure. They use a simple syntax that is designed for efficient implementation, not for effective configuration by an administrator.

Reference-contexts: Filter (drawbridge) Design Drawbridge is different from any of the current standard firewall configurations. Using the categorization of firewalls developed by Ranum <ref> [2] </ref>, drawbridge compares best to a filtering router firewall configuration --WARN-- [acc012w] Login ID sundiag has uid == 0. The listed login ID has a user ID of zero (0) and is not the 'root' account. This should be checked to see if it is legitimate.
