Abstract: Trees are a natural representation for countable ordinals. In particular, finite trees provide a convenient notation for the predicative ones. Processes that transform trees or terms can often be proved terminating by viewing the tree or the tree representation of the term as an ordinal.

Reference-contexts: This is analogous to tree ordinals as defined in <ref> [ Dennis-Jones and Wainer, 1983 ] </ref> : 0 is a tree ordinal; if ff is then so is ff + 1; if ff n (n 2 N) are, then the !-sequence ff 0 ; ff 1 ; : : : (representing their limit) also is.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, replacing a subtree with any finite number of smaller trees results in a smaller tree. Ordered this way, finite trees give all ordinals up to * 0 . (See <ref> [ Dershowitz and Manna, 1979 ] </ref> for well-founded orderings of multisets.) One can, alternatively, consider ordered trees and use the same interpretation, except for substituting noncommutative addition.

Then we extend the mapping of trees to ordinals by making s greater than t if the root of s is greater than the root of t and s is greater than the subtrees of t.
