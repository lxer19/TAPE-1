Abstract: Multicast network traffic is information with one source node, but many destination nodes. Rather than setting up individual connections between the source node and each destination node, or broadcasting the information to the entire network, multicasting efficiently exploits link capacity by allowing the source node to transmit a small number of copies of the information to mutually-exclusive groups of destination nodes. Multicasting is an important topic in the fields of networking (video and audio conferencing, video on demand, local-area network interconnection) and computer architecture (cache coherency, multiprocessor message passing). In this paper, we derive approximate expressions for the minimum cost (in terms of link utilization) of shortest-path multicast traffic in arbitrary tree networks. Our results provide a theoretical best-case scenario for link utilization of multicast distribution in tree topologies overlaid onto arbitrary graphs. In real networks such as the Internet MBONE, multicast distribution paths are often tree-like, but contain some cycles for purposes of fault tolerance. We find that even for richly-connected graphs such as the shu*enet and the hypercube, our expression provides a good prediction of the cost (in terms of link utilization) of multicast communication. Thus, this theoretical result has two applications; (1) a lower bound on the link capacity required for multicasting in random tree topologies, and (2) an approximation of the cost of multicasting in regular LAN and MAN topologies. fl An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Fifth International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks. keywords: multicast traffic, lower bound, shortest-path, regular graphs, expected cost.

Reference-contexts: Shortest-path routing is a very popular scheme that chooses the fewest number of intermediate nodes between the source and destination. It has been deployed in many wide-area networks in the form of the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) <ref> [1] </ref>, which is based on the Ford-Fulkerson max-flow-min-cut algorithm [2]. Limiting our scope to this class of graphs greatly reduces the complexity of the analysis and, as shown in Section 5, does not reduce the applicability of our results.

Reference-contexts: However, the analytical expression is a close approximation of the empirical performance of the routing algorithm. In Figure 7 we compare the analytical expression with the average multicast cost in a 64-node (2; 4)-Shu*enet. For the shu*enet, the recently developed multicasting algorithm presented in <ref> [5] </ref> 17 was simulated. Again, we find that the analytical results follow the same trends as the simulation results, although the difference is a bit larger than was observed in the hypercube case.

Our analytical approach is similar to that of the derivation of the Moore bound, which is the lower bound on the number of links necessary for point-to-point communication in regular graphs. <p> In Figure 6, we compare the analytical multicasting cost for various m in a 64-node, d = 6 heap (upper curve) with the simulated multicasting cost in a binary hypercube with d = 6 and N = 64 nodes (lower curve). The multicasting algorithm presented in <ref> [6] </ref> was used in the simulations. The figure shows that the analytical expression is no longer a lower bound. This is because the hypercube has multiple paths between the source and each member in the destination set. The multiple paths, as discussed above, lead to lower multicasting costs. <p> Broadcasting is a trivial 2 Note that the curves shown in this figure are very similar to the figures developed in <ref> [6] </ref> where a heuristic 18 traffic, for a network with K = 5 and d = 2 (N K = 63). solution; the cost does not change with m.
