Abstract: We present some algorithms which construct a triangular graph given a set of points, where each face of the graph complies with the Delaunay criteria. Then we develop an linear time algorithm to construct the contour of such a triangular graph, where each face is coloured either black or white. Our techniques avoid expensive trigonometric computations. We intoduce our algorithms for the 2-dimensional case and show how to extend them to the d-dimensional case in a straightforward manner.

Reference-contexts: The remaining graph is made up of what we call the black components of G. The computation of the black components can be done using standard algorithms for connected components which are based on depth-first-search or breadth-first search (see e.g. <ref> [AHU 83] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The problem of finding simple cycles is one of the most basic and natural algorithmic graph problems (see [Le 90]) and was considered by many researchers e.g. [Mo 85], <ref> [AYZ 95] </ref>, [DW 97a], [DW 97b]. However, in the present paper we search for a special set of cycles namely the external contour.

Reference-contexts: From a triangulated structure representing a surface, we can compute slope, aspect, visibility, isolines, light reflectance from the surface, volume above or below the surface with respect to a given datum. For our algorithms, we use the Delaunay triangulation, having some nice properties <ref> [Au 91] </ref>. Definition 1 Let P = fp 1 ; :::; p n g IR d be a set of d-dimensional points.

Reference-contexts: The Delaunay triangulation of a Voronoi diagram is unique: The cells which circumscribe the simplices do not contain any point of P in their interior. This property gives us the simple algorithm SimpleDelaunay (P) with a worst-case complexity of O (n dn=2e+1 ) <ref> [Bo 81] </ref>. SimpleDelaunay (P) Input: A set P = fp 1 ; :::; p n g IR d of points. Output: The Delaunay triangulation of P. 1. Let s 1 := (p 1 ; :::; p d+1 ) be the first simplex. 2.

Reference-contexts: However, in the present paper we search for a special set of cycles namely the external contour. An (external) contour C (introduced in <ref> [DL 95] </ref>) of a colored triangular embedding T consists of those cycles of S, which are not enclosed by another cycle of S. The task of computing the external contour of T can now be formalized to produce the set C.

Reference-contexts: The task of computing the external contour of T can now be formalized to produce the set C. The following well known lemma (see e.g. [Ha 69] <ref> [Ev 79] </ref>) is helpful, because for planar graphs it implies that an O (jV j + jEj) algorithm is really an O (jV j) algorithm. Lemma 2 If G = (V; E) is any planar graph with jV j 3. Then G has at most 3jV j 6 edges.

Reference-contexts: In fact, S is a collection of edge-disjoint simple cycles (the points of the cycles being evident by context) of T , which are separating white and black regions. The problem of finding simple cycles is one of the most basic and natural algorithmic graph problems (see <ref> [Le 90] </ref>) and was considered by many researchers e.g. [Mo 85], [AYZ 95], [DW 97a], [DW 97b].
