Reference-contexts: The systematic relation between complementary senses has been investigated by a number of researchers. The following section discusses some early contributions by [ Weinreich, 1964 ] , [ Weinreich, 196x ] and <ref> [ Apresjan, 1973 ] </ref> . Weinreich makes a number of interesting observations about the nature of polysemy and some of the systematicity behind it, but falls short of giving particular examples, apart for illustration. <p> the first two of which are more AI inspired (conceptual graphs and abduction) whereas the second and third are more linguistically oriented (lexical rules and lexical representations). 2.2 Early observations Our discussion of previous work in this field starts with [ Weinreich, 1964 ] , [ Weinreich, 196x ] and <ref> [ Apresjan, 1973 ] </ref> , neglecting much of the work that preceded them, including for instance [ Stern, 1931 ] and other research on linguistic semantics that predates current approaches to linguistic theory and was still largely grounded in etymological studies. <p> Only when such discrepancies become frequent and systematic will an adjustment in the common significatum take place: this is the adult's way of keeping up with semantic change.' 2.2.2 Apresjan <ref> [ Apresjan, 1973 ] </ref> 1 agrees with previous researchers like Weinreich `that the usual explanatory dictionaries greatly exaggerate the measure of discreteness of meanings and are inclined to set clear-cut borders where a closer examination of the actually existing variety of texts reveals only a vague intermediate area of overlapping meanings.' <p> Lexical Implication Rules An interesting collection of lexical rules is introduced in [ Ostler and Atkins, 1993 ] . It comprises of a database of about 130 `types of systematic meaning shift' that are called Lexical Implication Rules (LIR's). It draws on previous work in Fillmore, <ref> [ Apresjan, 1973 ] </ref> , Leech, Levin, Miller, Clark and Clark, Aronoff, Lehrer, Talmy, Levi and [ Pustejovsky, 1991a ] .

Reference-contexts: The term is used here in the informal sense of [ Cruse, 1986 ] . Entailment in qualia structure could however be given a default logic interpretation by adopting the idea of common sense entailment <ref> [ Asher and Morreau, 1990 ] </ref> . For instance, the word book by default entails at least the two events of reading and writing it, besides the knowledge that it consists of several parts: the cover, pages, etc. This should not be confused with the connotation of a word.

Reference-contexts: Systematically polysemous nouns, on the other hand, will occur with different, but related interpretations, throughout a coherent discourse. The noun `school', for instance, can refer in the same discourse to a group of people, a 4 learning process, an institution and a building 1 <ref> [ Bierwisch, 1982 ] </ref> . This noun will thus be underspec--ified for any one of these related senses, unless in a local part of the discourse (a coherent discourse segment, a sentence, or even part of a sentence a collocation) one sense is more prominent than any of the others. <p> There has been some discussion in the literature about what the nature of this relation exactly is: semantic [ Puste 16 jovsky, 1991a ] , conceptual <ref> [ Bierwisch, 1982 ] </ref> or pragmatic [ Nunberg, 1979 ] [ Ruhl, 1989 ] [ Mercer, 1993 ] [ Lascarides and Copestake, 1995 ] . <p> Nevertheless, such a conceptual level inbetween semantics and pragmatics could help to `liberate' lexical semantics from a formal semantic harness, that stresses in particular compositionality and looses sight of the wider associations that most lexical items have. 17 For instance, examples (5a) through (5d) illustrate the systematic polysemy of school <ref> [ Bierwisch, 1982 ] </ref> . (5a) a group of people: The school went for an outing. (5b) a learning process: School starts at 8.30 (5c) an institution: The school was founded in 1910. (5d) a building: The school has a new roof.

Reference-contexts: Such an approach has in fact been taken by a number of researchers, see for instance the collections of papers in [ Zernik, 1991 ] and <ref> [ Boguraev and Pustejovsky, 1996 ] </ref> . Much of this research however is devoted to the extraction of lexical semantic structure for verbs, rather than nouns, which is the topic of this thesis.

Reference-contexts: This example shows that the analysis of such problems not only employ the lexical semantic structure of the functor (to want), but also that of the (head of the) argument (a beer). As such, the analysis goes 2 For instance the bridging problem in discourse analysis <ref> [ Bos et al., 1995 ] </ref> . 42 beyond traditional composition in semantic analysis and is therefore referred to as co-compositonality (see [ Pustejovsky, 1991a ] , [ Buitelaar and Mineur, 1994 ] , [ Pustejovsky, 1995 ] , [ Mineur and Buitelaar, 1996 ] ).

Reference-contexts: Purely statistical, connectionist research in lexical knowledge acquisition is knowledge poor (for instance [ Brown et al., 1992 ] [ Schutze, 1992 ] [ Schutze, 1994 ] ), whereas research that relies more on linguistic structure tends to be richer in knowledge (for instance [ Hindle, 1990 ] <ref> [ Brent, 1993 ] </ref> [ Pustejovsky et al., 1993 ] [ Pereira et al., 1993 ] ). The approach I take here assumes the following sources of a priori knowledge: part of speech tags; morphological stems; some syntactic structure; sets of semantic classes and semantic roles.

Reference-contexts: All other word-internal punctuation like hyphens (`-' , ` '), symbols (`$' , `%'), and others are preserved also. Part-of-speech tagging The tokenized version of a text is part-of-speech tagged with an off-the-shelf tagger <ref> [ Brill, 1992 ] </ref> . The tagger is not trained for a specific document, or set of documents. I assume throughout the research that the default training of the Brill tagger on the brown corpus is general enough to handle most kinds of text.

Reference-contexts: Knowledge acquisition methods like classification can range from knowledge poor methods, assuming few or none a priori knowledge sources, to knowledge rich ones. Purely statistical, connectionist research in lexical knowledge acquisition is knowledge poor (for instance <ref> [ Brown et al., 1992 ] </ref> [ Schutze, 1992 ] [ Schutze, 1994 ] ), whereas research that relies more on linguistic structure tends to be richer in knowledge (for instance [ Hindle, 1990 ] [ Brent, 1993 ] [ Pustejovsky et al., 1993 ] [ Pereira et al., 1993 ]

Reference-contexts: However, also non-content or function words can be said to be sytematically polysemous. Studies have been done for instance on prepositions <ref> [ Brugman, 1981 ] </ref> . Even function words with hardly any conceptual content, like con-nectives have predictable polysemous behaviors.

Reference-contexts: Agentive nominals are nouns that refer to both human objects with certain occupations and artifact objects that came to fullfil those same activities. Examples are printer, computer, trainer, washer (see <ref> [ Busa, 1997 ] </ref> for an analysis of this group of nouns). It has to be noted that most of these nouns will not easily occur in discourse with their two related interpretations being expressed at the same time, which warrants a representation using the `open' dotted type.

Reference-contexts: An argument that is typed to be of some polymorphic type can assume different `forms' (hence poly-morphism) depending on which particular functor has been applied to it. Coercion is taking things from the perspective of the functor, that `coerces' its argument (s) to take on a particular `form' <ref> [ Cardelli and Wegner, 1985 ] </ref> . Most of the applications of type shifting as proposed in the literature are semantically motivated approaches to syntactic problems. Consider for instance the following sentence: (17) John and every (other) student went to her party.

Reference-contexts: Instead, I propose a form of semantic tagging that will preserve polysemous knowledge through underspecification of the lexical semantic knowledge involved. Other researchers have pointed out the same problem. For instance, <ref> [ Charniak, 1993 ] </ref> (quoting [ Schutze, 1992 ] ) gives the following example from The New York Times: 1 Compare recent, corpus-based research on definite descriptions [ Poesio and Vieira, 1998 ] , in which it is observed that in many cases human annotators cannot decide between interpretations for certain

Reference-contexts: Mutual Information The influence of frequency (sparseness of data) is smoothed out somehow by using mutual information (MI) scores rather than raw frequencies <ref> [ Church and Hanks, 1990 ] </ref> . Computing MI scores is by now a standard procedure for measuring the co-occurrence between objects relative to their overall occurrence.

Reference-contexts: Lexical Operations <ref> [ Copestake and Briscoe, 1993 ] </ref> propose socalled lexical operations in the context of unification-based grammars. A lexical operation is a feature structure that takes a feature structure as input and outputs another feature structure 4 . <p> spoon, fork, hand, fist belly,... (other items that can be viewed as containers) The implementation of a LIR is not discussed in much detail in [ Ostler and Atkins, 1993 ] , but there seems to be no reason against treating them in similar ways as the lexical operations in <ref> [ Copestake and Briscoe, 1993 ] </ref> or the lexical rules in [ Viegas et al., 1996 ] . Metaphor Extension The lexical rules that were mentioned before are all based on metonymic relations between lexical meanings. <p> A representation in DATR takes the form of a set of path equations which are basically attribute-value pairs as in constraint-based approaches [ Shieber, 1992 ] . In this respect lexical entries in DATR are similar to the ones in <ref> [ Copestake and Briscoe, 1993 ] </ref> . These could in fact be expressed in DATR because it is not restricted to any particular theory. It is a representation language for lexical knowledge with the possibility of defining (multiple) inheritance and defaults. <p> Some researchers working with GL have made suggestions for a 1 For more on underspecification see for instance the collection of papers in [ van Deemter and Peters, 1996 ] 32 revised qualia structure [ Calzolari, 1991 ] <ref> [ Copestake and Briscoe, 1993 ] </ref> , which includes not only these four roles, but any kind of (lexical) knowledge.

To deal with the semi-productivity of lexical rules they introduce a probabilistic constraint 6 on the application order of the rules. <p> According to <ref> [ Copestake and Briscoe, 1995 ] </ref> the interpretation of rabbit as rabbit meat in (7a) is `neutral', whereas the interpretations in (7b) and (7c) are more on the periphery. (7a) John prefers rabbit. (7b) John wants three rabbits. (7c) The diners ordered three rabbits.

Reference-contexts: This could be represented explicitly also, which is the approach taken in diderot <ref> [ Cowie et al., 1993 ] </ref> , an information extraction system that employs lexical semantic representations based on GL. Figure 3.3 is an example lexical entry in this system for the noun agreement. The cospec feature gives a number of collocational patterns in which this noun participates.

Reference-contexts: I take qualia structure to consist of a set of lexical entailments, which is not to be seen strictly as logical entailment. The term is used here in the informal sense of <ref> [ Cruse, 1986 ] </ref> . Entailment in qualia structure could however be given a default logic interpretation by adopting the idea of common sense entailment [ Asher and Morreau, 1990 ] .

Reference-contexts: segment, but this has not been implemented. 113 Identifying Interpretations within Dotted Types The research reported in this section is similar to, but should not be compared directly with work on word sense disambiguation (WSD), as for instance reported in [ Yarowsky, 1992 ] [ Wilks and Stevenson, 1996 ] <ref> [ Dagan et al., 1997 ] </ref> . First, because most of the WSD research is concerned with homonyms, where discrete senses are more easily discerned. Results are therefore hardly comparable with the task put forward here, that is, to distinguish word sense differences on a much more fine-grained level.

Reference-contexts: Next to the abduction approach there are other and more direct implementations of Nunberg's program as reported in <ref> [ Dolling, 1994 ] </ref> and [ Verschuur, 1993 ] , both of which use higher order logics ( calculus). 2.4.3 Lexical Rules Opposite to the ideas of general knowledge representation schemes (conceptual graphs) or general inference schemes (abduction) is the approach of stipulating a number of lexical rules, that can be <p> Experiments along these lines have been reported in <ref> [ Dolling, 1994 ] </ref> and [ Verschuur, 1993 ] . This thesis by itself is not concerned primarily with issues of formal interpretation and considers coercion merely as a `selection' operation that picks out appropriate knowledge as stored in the qualia structure on request.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, abductive reasoning and lexical semantic representations are in no way mutually exclusive and their combination would be quite fruitful. One option for specifying lexical (semantic) representations is DATR <ref> [ Evans and Gazdar, 1996 ] </ref> . A representation in DATR takes the form of a set of path equations which are basically attribute-value pairs as in constraint-based approaches [ Shieber, 1992 ] . <p> The representation in Figure 2.6 illustrates the systematic polysemy of fruits like cherry, mango, etc. This class of lexical items is systematically polysemous between a fruit, the tree that grows the fruit and the wood produced by the tree (from <ref> [ Evans and Gazdar, 1996 ] </ref> , after a proposal in [ Kilgarriff, 1995 ] ).

Reference-contexts: Apparently, human subjects tend to associate among words mainly within the same syntactic category. `[N]oun probes elicited nouns responses 79% of the time, adjectives elicited adjectives 65% of the time, and verbs elicited verbs 43% of the time' [ Miller et al., 1990 ] (quoting from <ref> [ Fillenbaum and Jones, 1965 ] </ref> ). The inherent redundancy of this approach, with lexical items showing up in more than one database, is taken for granted because of its psychological realism. Each database is organized in a different way.

Reference-contexts: 79 I discuss some of the details of both thematic role assignment and of the analysis of part-whole relationships and modification. 5.3.1 Thematic Roles The assignment of semantic roles to syntactic phrases has some tradition in linguistic theory, but originates primarily with [ Tesniere, 1959 ] and was extended by <ref> [ Fillmore, 1968 ] </ref> . The basic idea is to assign an additional (`semantic') structure to a sentence, or sentential clause that overlays the syntactic one.

Reference-contexts: Systematic polysemy can be distinguished from homonymy by looking at the behavior of lexical meaning in discourse. Homonys, like `bank' will be referred to in a coherent discourse in only one of their (unrelated) senses. This, in fact, has been established empirically <ref> [ Gale et al., 1992 ] </ref> . Systematically polysemous nouns, on the other hand, will occur with different, but related interpretations, throughout a coherent discourse.

Reference-contexts: The classification algorithm is centered around the computation of a similarity score (Jaccard <ref> [ Grefenstette, 1994 ] </ref> ) that compares objects (nouns and classes of nouns) in terms of the attributes they share. Here, attributes are linguistic patterns (functional relations) as they appear in the acquired underspecified representations. <p> At the core of the algorithm is the computation of a similarity score between each noun and each (CoreLex) class. For this purpose I use the Jaccard measure that compares objects relative to the attributes they share <ref> [ Grefenstette, 1994 ] </ref> . Here, attributes are the different (thematic) roles of a noun: agent, theme, nom mod, adj mod, etc.

Reference-contexts: The approach taken here specifically assumes a set of predefined semantic classes as defined in the CoreLex ontology. In this I follow previous work by a number of researchers in semantic classification, word sense tagging and disambiguation [ Yarowsky, 1992 ] , [ Resnik, 1992 ] , <ref> [ Grefenstette, 1996 ] </ref> , who point out the need for an a priori classification scheme, like the roget thesaurus, as a gold standard to compare classification results with. 6.4.1 Classification Algorithm For the purposes of this thesis, semantic classification is based on similarities in linguistic context between nouns (or lexical

Reference-contexts: We can use this definition to derive an estimate of the connectedness between words, in terms of collocations [ Smadja, 1993 ] , but also in terms of phrases and grammatical relations <ref> [ Hindle, 1990 ] </ref> . <p> Purely statistical, connectionist research in lexical knowledge acquisition is knowledge poor (for instance [ Brown et al., 1992 ] [ Schutze, 1992 ] [ Schutze, 1994 ] ), whereas research that relies more on linguistic structure tends to be richer in knowledge (for instance <ref> [ Hindle, 1990 ] </ref> [ Brent, 1993 ] [ Pustejovsky et al., 1993 ] [ Pereira et al., 1993 ] ).

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, if researchers address the issue of automatic lexical knowledge extraction for (proper) nouns, then often this is done in the context of information extraction, a field of study that tries to obtain very specific information in large bodies of text (see e.g.: <ref> [ Hobbs et al., 1997 ] </ref> ). The objective here is somewhat different. Information extraction systems mostly deal with a rather limited set of database relations that need to be `populated' by examining texts for relevant occurrences.

Reference-contexts: These numbers suggest a stronger emphasis in research on systematic polysemy and less on homonyms, an approach that is advocated here (see also <ref> [ Kilgarriff, 1992 ] </ref> ). In CoreLex, homonyms are simply assigned two or more underspecified semantic types, that need to be disambiguated in a traditional way. There is however an added value also here because each disambiguated type is underspecified by itself, generating a number of related interpretations.

Reference-contexts: First, because most of the WSD research is concerned with homonyms, where discrete senses are more easily discerned. Results are therefore hardly comparable with the task put forward here, that is, to distinguish word sense differences on a much more fine-grained level. As observed in <ref> [ Kilgarriff, 1997a ] </ref> quoting Yorick Wilks (personal communication): "The state of the art is such that WSD with coarse-grained senses, or homographs, is attainable at well over 90%, whereas for fine-grained WSD even human inter-annotator agreement is very low."

Reference-contexts: WordNet seems primarily to be designed as a computational account of the human capacity of linguistic categorization <ref> [ Miller et al., 1990 ] </ref> . It therefore covers a rather extensive set of lexico-semantic categories, or synsets as they are commonly referred to 2 . Synsets are collections of synonyms, that are used to group together lexical items according to similar meanings. <p> Apparently, human subjects tend to associate among words mainly within the same syntactic category. `[N]oun probes elicited nouns responses 79% of the time, adjectives elicited adjectives 65% of the time, and verbs elicited verbs 43% of the time' <ref> [ Miller et al., 1990 ] </ref> (quoting from [ Fillenbaum and Jones, 1965 ] ). The inherent redundancy of this approach, with lexical items showing up in more than one database, is taken for granted because of its psychological realism. Each database is organized in a different way. <p> In addition, such a partitioning `also has practical advantages: it reduces the size of the files that the lexicographers must work with, and makes it possible to assign the writing and editing of different files to different lexicographers.'

Compositionality in this model is typically viewed as a functor taking any number of typed arguments. Application of the functor to the argument (s) can only be successful if the arguments are of the `right' type as requested by the functor.

Reference-contexts: A clear example of this are nouns like book that refer to both a physical object () entity) and its content () abstraction). There are a number of underspecified semantic types describing such nouns as displayed in Figure 4.12. 9 Compare recent, corpus-based research on definite descriptions <ref> [ Poesio and Vieira, 1998 ] </ref> , in which it is observed that in many cases human annotators cannot decide between interpretations for certain discourse referents. 58 This hierarchy gives the structure of the following underspecified semantic types: caa, cea, com and cae. <p> Other researchers have pointed out the same problem.

The idea for CoreLex itself originates out of an NSF-ARPA funded research project on the Core Lexical Engine, a joint research project of Brandeis University and Apple Computers Inc. [ Pustejovsky et al., 1995 ] . <p> It comprises of a database of about 130 `types of systematic meaning shift' that are called Lexical Implication Rules (LIR's). It draws on previous work in Fillmore, [ Apresjan, 1973 ] , Leech, Levin, Miller, Clark and Clark, Aronoff, Lehrer, Talmy, Levi and <ref> [ Pustejovsky, 1991a ] </ref> . Each LIR is documented with `separate lists (as complete as possible) of the sets of words which participate in each type, and those which might be expected to, but do not'. <p> It can be `decomposed' into several components that are closely related but not fully dependent on each other. The following is an overview of the theory as it emerges from existing literature (see <ref> [ Pustejovsky, 1991a ] </ref> , [ Pustejovsky et al., 1993 ] , [ Pustejovsky and Boguraev, 1993 ] , [ Pustejovsky, 1994a ] , [ Pustejovsky, 1994b ] , [ Pustejovsky and Busa, 1995 ] , [ Pustejovsky, 1995 ] and [ Pustejovsky, 1996 ] ). 29 Representation Event Structure : <p> polysemy Qualia Roles : Representation language for Qualia Structure Dotted Types : Type system for Qualia Roles Co-Specification : Representation of syntax-semantics mapping Interpretation Projective Inheritance : Extended type driven interpretation Co-Compositionality : Bi-directional compositional constraints Coercion : Type error handling 3.2 Representation 3.2.1 Event, Argument and Qualia Structure In <ref> [ Pustejovsky, 1991a ] </ref> and more elaborate in [ Pustejovsky, 1995 ] the semantics of a lexical item is defined by the following tuple: ff = hA; E ; Q; Ii `...where A is the argument structure, E is the specification of the event structure, Q provides the binding of these <p> Qualia structure on the other hand should be viewed as an underspecified representation of the denotation of a lexical item 1 . 3.2.2 Qualia Roles In <ref> [ Pustejovsky, 1991a ] </ref> four qualia roles are introduced, each addressing a different semantic aspect: formal : inheritance (hyponymy) constitutive : modification (including meronymy) telic : purpose agentive : causality These four roles are described as `a necessary component' of semantic representation, but they are nowhere assumed to be exclusive. <p> J. Liebling, 1960) 3.2.4 Co-Specification An important aspect of the representation of lexical semantic structure in GL is the mapping onto syntactic structure. In <ref> [ Pustejovsky, 1991a ] </ref> and repeated in [ Pustejovsky, 1995 ] an implicit representation of this mapping is proposed by co-specifying the verbs that a noun co-occurs with in the telic and/or agentive qualia roles. Consider for instance the representation for cake in Figure 3.2. <p> This includes the use of polymorphic types [ Partee, 1987 ] [ Moortgat, 1988 ] [ Leiss, 1990 ] [ Shieber, 1992 ] [ Morrill, 1992 ] and coercion [ Moens and Steedman, 1987 ] <ref> [ Pustejovsky, 1991a ] </ref> [ Hobbs et al., 1993 ] [ Pollard and Sag, 1994 ] . Polymorphism and coercion are really two sides of the same coin. <p> As such, the analysis goes 2 For instance the bridging problem in discourse analysis [ Bos et al., 1995 ] . 42 beyond traditional composition in semantic analysis and is therefore referred to as co-compositonality (see <ref> [ Pustejovsky, 1991a ] </ref> , [ Buitelaar and Mineur, 1994 ] , [ Pustejovsky, 1995 ] , [ Mineur and Buitelaar, 1996 ] ).

Reference-contexts: Some of these classes have been discussed widely in the literature, while others may not have been observed before. The semantic types that describe these classes in an intensional way are underspecified representations based on qualia structure as developed within generative lexicon theory <ref> [ Pustejovsky, 1995 ] </ref> . <p> This approach further employs a theoretical underpinning for these lexical semantic studies (generative lexicon theory <ref> [ Pustejovsky, 1995 ] </ref> ) and ties this in with an empirical approach to semantic tagging, using various corpora to derive relevant underspecified lexical semantic representations. At the core of the thesis are the ideas of systematic polysemy and underspecification. <p> they are just different facets of an integrated approach to lexical semantic analysis in language understanding. 1.3 The CoreLex pro ject 1.3.1 About CoreLex Some history Many of the ideas described in this thesis are based on previous research within the framework of generative lexicon theory [ Pustejovsky, 1991a ] <ref> [ Pustejovsky, 1995 ] </ref> .

Although all four of the substructures are meant to apply to all parts of speech in <ref> [ Pustejovsky, 1995 ] </ref> , qualia structure was originally designed to deal specifically with nouns [ Pustejovsky, 1989 ] . Event and argument structure are longer standing lexical semantic representations that traditionally deal specifically with verbs (and nominalizations). <p> The problem of acquiring and representing this knowledge has been addressed by most current linguistic theories. All of them seem to agree on a tight coupling between neccesary arguments on the semantic level and realized syntactic constituents. The nature of this mapping, however, leaves some room for discussion. In <ref> [ Pustejovsky, 1995 ] </ref> a further distinction is made between types of arguments, specifically for verbs, that extends argument structure to include not only necessary but also optional arguments. <p> J. Liebling, 1960) 3.2.4 Co-Specification An important aspect of the representation of lexical semantic structure in GL is the mapping onto syntactic structure. In [ Pustejovsky, 1991a ] and repeated in <ref> [ Pustejovsky, 1995 ] </ref> an implicit representation of this mapping is proposed by co-specifying the verbs that a noun co-occurs with in the telic and/or agentive qualia roles. Consider for instance the representation for cake in Figure 3.2. <p> and atb 6= ?g [[*t ]] = f&lt; a; b &gt; j a * and b * t and aRb and &lt; a; b &gt; is a complex object g [[ffit ]] = f&lt; a; b &gt; j a * and b * t and aRbg An Example: artifact*tool In <ref> [ Pustejovsky, 1995 ] </ref> an example of unified types is given that can be reconstructed in terms of the definition just given. <p> As such, the analysis goes 2 For instance the bridging problem in discourse analysis [ Bos et al., 1995 ] . 42 beyond traditional composition in semantic analysis and is therefore referred to as co-compositonality (see [ Pustejovsky, 1991a ] , [ Buitelaar and Mineur, 1994 ] , <ref> [ Pustejovsky, 1995 ] </ref> , [ Mineur and Buitelaar, 1996 ] ). <p> Coercion as defined in <ref> [ Pustejovsky, 1995 ] </ref> , but also in [ Hobbs et al., 1993 ] although with rather different theoretical assumptions is more concerned with the knowledge that is involved in the analysis of such problems than with the formal limits of its application. <p> enough type theory that includes sortal restrictions on types, reflecting conceptual categories like artifact, human,..., one could perhaps give a formal definition of coercion along the lines of Montagovian type theory that covers examples brought up already by [ Nunberg, 1979 ] and extended by [ Puste-jovsky, 1991a ] , <ref> [ Pustejovsky, 1995 ] </ref> and [ Hobbs et al., 1993 ] . Experiments along these lines have been reported in [ Dolling, 1994 ] and [ Verschuur, 1993 ] . <p> Although this approach to qualia structure is somewhat different from the one discussed in <ref> [ Pustejovsky, 1995 ] </ref> , elsewhere a similar approach has been advocated [ Pustejovsky et al., 1993 ] , emphasizing also the dependence of qualia structure acquisition on the nature of particular corpora [ Johnston et al., 1995 ] . Here, qualia structure includes three roles: formal, constitutive, agentive telic. <p> example of the verb `to open': "Does `open an eye' have the same meaning of `open' as `open a box' ? What about `open one's mouth' ? Is there any reason to make a sharp distinction between them?" 96 A number of researchers have answered this question negatively (see eg: <ref> [ Pustejovsky, 1995 ] </ref> [ Kilgar- riff, 1992 ] ).

In this I follow previous work by a number of researchers in semantic classification, word sense tagging and disambiguation [ Yarowsky, 1992 ] , <ref> [ Resnik, 1992 ] </ref> , [ Grefenstette, 1996 ] , who point out the need for an a priori classification scheme, like the roget thesaurus, as a gold standard to compare classification results with. 6.4.1 Classification Algorithm For the purposes of this thesis, semantic classification is based on similarities in linguistic

Reference-contexts: There has been some discussion in the literature about what the nature of this relation exactly is: semantic [ Puste 16 jovsky, 1991a ] , conceptual [ Bierwisch, 1982 ] or pragmatic [ Nunberg, 1979 ] <ref> [ Ruhl, 1989 ] </ref> [ Mercer, 1993 ] [ Lascarides and Copestake, 1995 ] . Bierwisch' conceptual relation can be summarized as `semantic structure plus (linguistic) context' and I therefore group it together with the semantic relation, at least for the purposes of this thesis 2 .

Reference-contexts: Instead, I propose a form of semantic tagging that will preserve polysemous knowledge through underspecification of the lexical semantic knowledge involved. Other researchers have pointed out the same problem. For instance, [ Charniak, 1993 ] (quoting <ref> [ Schutze, 1992 ] </ref> ) gives the following example from The New York Times: 1 Compare recent, corpus-based research on definite descriptions [ Poesio and Vieira, 1998 ] , in which it is observed that in many cases human annotators cannot decide between interpretations for certain discourse referents. 95 (39) In <p> Knowledge acquisition methods like classification can range from knowledge poor methods, assuming few or none a priori knowledge sources, to knowledge rich ones. Purely statistical, connectionist research in lexical knowledge acquisition is knowledge poor (for instance [ Brown et al., 1992 ] <ref> [ Schutze, 1992 ] </ref> [ Schutze, 1994 ] ), whereas research that relies more on linguistic structure tends to be richer in knowledge (for instance [ Hindle, 1990 ] [ Brent, 1993 ] [ Pustejovsky et al., 1993 ] [ Pereira et al., 1993 ] ).

Reference-contexts: Knowledge acquisition methods like classification can range from knowledge poor methods, assuming few or none a priori knowledge sources, to knowledge rich ones. Purely statistical, connectionist research in lexical knowledge acquisition is knowledge poor (for instance [ Brown et al., 1992 ] [ Schutze, 1992 ] <ref> [ Schutze, 1994 ] </ref> ), whereas research that relies more on linguistic structure tends to be richer in knowledge (for instance [ Hindle, 1990 ] [ Brent, 1993 ] [ Pustejovsky et al., 1993 ] [ Pereira et al., 1993 ] ). <p> The approach I take here assumes the following sources of a priori knowledge: part of speech tags; morphological stems; some syntactic structure; sets of semantic classes and semantic roles. As pointed out in <ref> [ Schutze, 1994 ] </ref> , such a priori knowledge sources are symbolic (discrete, knowledge based) representations of linguistic competence, while subsymbolic (continuous, statistical) representations give an account of performance. Schutze then goes on to argue that for the study of performance subsymbolic representations are superior.

Reference-contexts: One option for specifying lexical (semantic) representations is DATR [ Evans and Gazdar, 1996 ] . A representation in DATR takes the form of a set of path equations which are basically attribute-value pairs as in constraint-based approaches <ref> [ Shieber, 1992 ] </ref> . In this respect lexical entries in DATR are similar to the ones in [ Copestake and Briscoe, 1993 ] . These could in fact be expressed in DATR because it is not restricted to any particular theory. <p> It is a representation language for lexical knowledge with the possibility of defining (multiple) inheritance and defaults. The representation of systematic polysemy which concerns us here most can be handled in DATR by using re-entrance (see e.g.: <ref> [ Shieber, 1992 ] </ref> ). The representation in Figure 2.6 illustrates the systematic polysemy of fruits like cherry, mango, etc. <p> Even function words with hardly any conceptual content, like con-nectives have predictable polysemous behaviors. This has been studied mostly in a formal semantic framework, in which the term polymorphic, rather than polysemous is used [ Leiss, 1990 ] [ Morrill, 1992 ] <ref> [ Shieber, 1992 ] </ref> . 28 Chapter 3 Generative Lexicon Theory 3.1 Introduction The previous chapter presented a number of approaches for dealing with systematic polysemy and adjacent phenomena (metonymy, metaphor, sense extension, coercion, etc.) Here I present an integrative theory of lexical semantics that addresses all of these issues by <p> More flexible approaches allow arguments to `shift' their type according to some rule or general principle. This includes the use of polymorphic types [ Partee, 1987 ] [ Moortgat, 1988 ] [ Leiss, 1990 ] <ref> [ Shieber, 1992 ] </ref> [ Morrill, 1992 ] and coercion [ Moens and Steedman, 1987 ] [ Pustejovsky, 1991a ] [ Hobbs et al., 1993 ] [ Pollard and Sag, 1994 ] . Polymorphism and coercion are really two sides of the same coin.

Reference-contexts: Computing MI scores is by now a standard procedure for measuring the co-occurrence between objects relative to their overall occurrence. We can use this definition to derive an estimate of the connectedness between words, in terms of collocations <ref> [ Smadja, 1993 ] </ref> , but also in terms of phrases and grammatical relations [ Hindle, 1990 ] .

Reference-contexts: According to a pragmatic analysis the entry would be down to basics and the inferences would be made on the basis of global principles or `conventions' [ Nunberg, 1979 ] . 18 2.4 Computational approaches 2.4.1 Conceptual Graphs <ref> [ Sowa, 1993 ] </ref> cites an example from [ Kayser, 1988 ] to illustrate how metonymies can be handled by conceptual graphs, a graphical knowledge representation language based on semantic networks. <p> Institution The Prix Goncourt perverts the literary life. With the conceptual graph in Figure 2.2 as background knowledge, each metonym of Prix Goncourt can be determined by following a path in the graph. Three sample inferences are (from <ref> [ Sowa, 1993 ] </ref> ): * Prize: The verb awarded in the input maps to the concept [AWARD]. The corresponding concept in the background graph is linked to [PRIZE] by the relation (PTNT). <p> From such a point of view qualia structure starts to resemble something like conceptual graphs [ Sowa, 1984 ] <ref> [ Sowa, 1993 ] </ref> , the (sub)world concepts in [ Nirenburg and Raskin, 1987 ] or any other semantic network oriented approach. This may in fact be a fruitful way of using qualia structure and it will be viewed in such a way in the context of this thesis.

Such an approach to lexical semantics is no longer very common and the emphasis switched to a synchronic study of meaning and meaning change.

Reference-contexts: In the following 79 I discuss some of the details of both thematic role assignment and of the analysis of part-whole relationships and modification. 5.3.1 Thematic Roles The assignment of semantic roles to syntactic phrases has some tradition in linguistic theory, but originates primarily with <ref> [ Tesniere, 1959 ] </ref> and was extended by [ Fillmore, 1968 ] . The basic idea is to assign an additional (`semantic') structure to a sentence, or sentential clause that overlays the syntactic one.

Many of the systems that have been developed within the AI community have a basic architecture that is based on inheritance as the primary inference engine between knowledge structures in the system.

Reference-contexts: In sequence, these include tokenizing, part-of-speech tagging and stemming the text: Tokenization The tokenizer used in this research was constructed at Brandeis as a general tool in natural language analysis, not specifically tuned to one or more specific document forms <ref> [ Verhagen, 1996 ] </ref> . It splits texts into sentences, one per line, using punctuation marks (`.', `?' , `!') as split-off points. Abbreviations, numbers and other usage of dots (`.') are preserved however, that is, they are not treated as split-off points. <p> Here I use a stemmer that was developed at Brandeis <ref> [ Verhagen, 1996 ] </ref> by enhancing a stemming algorithm widely used in informa tion retrieval [ Porter, 1980 ] , with the Celex 2 database on English morphology.

Reference-contexts: Next to the abduction approach there are other and more direct implementations of Nunberg's program as reported in [ Dolling, 1994 ] and <ref> [ Verschuur, 1993 ] </ref> , both of which use higher order logics ( calculus). 2.4.3 Lexical Rules Opposite to the ideas of general knowledge representation schemes (conceptual graphs) or general inference schemes (abduction) is the approach of stipulating a number of lexical rules, that can be applied to specific classes of <p> Experiments along these lines have been reported in [ Dolling, 1994 ] and <ref> [ Verschuur, 1993 ] </ref> . This thesis by itself is not concerned primarily with issues of formal interpretation and considers coercion merely as a `selection' operation that picks out appropriate knowledge as stored in the qualia structure on request.

Reference-contexts: This kind of knowledge is however highly domain dependent taking the form of corpus specific collocations (see Section 3.2.4) and 43 is further constrained by discourse structure [ Lascarides and Copestake, 1995 ] <ref> [ Verspoor, 1996 ] </ref> . The use of qualia structure in semantic interpretation is illustrated maybe even clearer in examples that involve systematic polysemy as in sentence (43a): (21) BMW announced a new model.

(7a) John prefers rabbit. (7b) John wants three rabbits. (7c) The diners ordered three rabbits.

Metaphor Extension The lexical rules that were mentioned before are all based on metonymic relations between lexical meanings. As Apresjan observed already, it is mostly metonymy that leads to systematic (or `regular') polysemy. Sometimes however, metaphor will also.
