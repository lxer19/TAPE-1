Title: THE AUTOMATED HIGHWAY SYSTEM: A TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY  
Author: M. Broucke and P. Varaiya

Abstract: The current vehicle-highway system has reached a plateau in its ability to meet the demand for moving goods and people. We sketch an architecture for an automated highway system or AHS. The architecture can be realized by several designs that differ in terms of performance and sophistication. We describe one design that could triple capacity and reduce travel time; guarantee collision-free operation in the absence of malfunctions; limit performance degradation in the case of faults; and reduce emissions by half. We summarize evidence suggesting that the design can be implemented. We indicate how the design can be adapted to different urban and rural scenarios and how a standard land use model can show the impact of AHS on urban density. We conclude with a critique of AHS.

Reference-contexts: The network layer assigns a path to the vehicle consisting of a sequence of nodes which the vehicle must pass through. The algorithm for obtaining the the short travel time is based on the Bellman-Ford algorithm (see, e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>). The network layer requires the travel time in each link. This information is provided by the link layer. Link layer. The link layer controller, developed by Rao and Varaiya [2], sends commands to each patch in a link.

Reference-contexts: The approach for lateral control is based on magnetic markers placed 1-2 meters apart in the center of the au-tomated lane. Hall effect magnetometers on the front of the vehicle sense the magnetic field from the markers. Lateral displacement is determined based on the magnetic field measurements <ref> [8] </ref>. Both frequency-shaped linear quadratic and fuzzy controllers have been used in simulation and experiments to achieve lateral control.

Reference-contexts: Static capacity predictions are not reliable as capacity will be affected by entry and exit activities, roadway design, and typical O-D patterns. Two alternatives are available for more accurate capacity predictions. One approach uses SmartPath <ref> [10] </ref> to run micro-simulations with typical traffic scenarios. In one study, the effect of entry and exit on capacity was investigated [11] where it was shown that high on-ramp flows (1800 vehicles/hr) could be supported without appreciably affecting capacity. However, the exit is a major bottleneck.

Reference-contexts: However, the exit is a major bottleneck. The disturbance from vehicles exiting using the platoon split maneuver could reduce the capacity 25 percent, or 5500 vehicles/hr. A second approach to obtain capacity estimates uses an AHS macro-simulator SmartCap <ref> [12] </ref>. In this approach the flow is differentiated by O-D pair and by the activities vehicles are performing. Activities are vehicle maneuvers such as cruising, platooning, lane change, entry, or exit.

Reference-contexts: The calculation here is conceptually straightforward: how do drivers determine which routes to take when faced with the changes in travel time induced by the AHS? In principle one can evaluate this impact using available theories and numerical models of route selection <ref> [17] </ref>. The transportation impact will work itself out in a short time as soon as travelers become familiar with the new choice available to them.

Reference-contexts: This can be done with the help of simple analytical general equilibrium models, in which one varies the transportation cost structure and determines the directions of change in the land use equilibrium. For example, a simple version of the standard model (see, e.g., <ref> [20] </ref>) implies that the rent difference between two locations is proportional to the difference in the transport cost from those two locations. The implantation of an AHS will alter the transport costs from those locations from which trips will make use of the AHS.
