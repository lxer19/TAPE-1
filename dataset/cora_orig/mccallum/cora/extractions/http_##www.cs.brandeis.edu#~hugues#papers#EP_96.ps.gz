Abstract: We recently solved the two spirals problem, a difficult neural network benchmark classification problem, using the genetic programming primitives set up by [Koza, 1992]. Instead of using absolute fitness, we use a relative fitness based on a competition for coverage of the data set. This is a form of co-evolutionary search because the fitness function changes with the population. Because niches are opened by proportionate reproduction, rather than crowded out, and because of the crossover operator, we find solutions which have a nice modular structure. Our experiments used our Massively Parallel Genetic Programming (MPGP) system running on a SIMD machine of

Reference-contexts: In this paper, only a tournament style of competitive evolution has been used and compared to canonical GP. A more general presentation of the different strategies that have been implemented can be found in <ref> [Juille & Pollack, 1995] </ref>. 3 The Spiral Problem and the Competi tive Evolution Paradigm Experiments were conducted to compare canonical GP evolution to competitive evolution for the intertwined spiral problem. This learning problem consists in classifying points into two classes according to two intertwined spirals. <p> Once individual fitness is evaluated, selection and recombination are performed according to a fitness proportionate rule. Details of the implementation of selection and recombination procedures for MPGP can be found in <ref> [Juille & Pollack, 1995] </ref>.
