Abstract: We present a randomized approach to path planning for articulated robots that have closed kinematic chains. The approach extends the probabilistic roadmap technique which has previously been applied to rigid and elastic objects, and articulated robots without closed chains. Our work provides a framework for path planning problems that must satisfy closure constraints in addition to standard collision constraints. This expands the power of the probabilistic roadmap technique to include a variety of problems such as manipulation planning using two open-chain manipulators that cooperatively grasp an object, forming a system with a closed chain, and planning for reconfigurable robots where the robot links may be rearranged in a loop to ease manipulation or locomotion. We generate the vertices in our probabilistic roadmap by sampling random configurations that ignore kinematic closure, and by performing randomized gradient descent to force satisfaction of the closure constraints. We generate edges in the roadmap by executing a randomized traversal of the constraint surface between two vertices. In this paper, we focus our presentation on the problem of planning the motions for a collection of attached links in a two-dimensional environment with obstacles. The approach has been implemented and successfully demonstrated on several examples.

Reference-contexts: Our approach provides an efficient way to compute the motion of the closed chain. Our approach may shed new light to manipulation planning and seed new research in that area. For example, manipulation planning algorithms consider all possible combinations of grasp positions <ref> [1] </ref>, which can be very large, or first plan for the object and then use inverse kinematics to plan for the robots. <p> Let q init 2 C sat and q goal 2 C sat be the initial configuration and goal configuration, respectively. The task is to find a continuous path t : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! C sat such that t (0) = q init and t (1) = q goal .

Reference-contexts: When closed kinematic chains exist, such luxuries disappear because path planning must be performed on a variety.

Reference-contexts: RANDOM NHBR may have to guess many nearby configurations to produce one that is collision-free. Rather than compute a complicated gradient of e (q), any random configuration that is better than q is kept. This was observed in <ref> [4] </ref> to be much faster than computing an analytical gradient for high-degree-of-freedom problems.

Reference-contexts: These robots support multiple modalities of locomotion and manipulation. Closed chains are often present in locomotion gaits [24], or arise during the reconfiguration task. There is also is a growing interest in computational chemistry to develop tools that efficiently search the configuration space of flexible molecules <ref> [11] </ref>. The atoms and bonds can be modeled as joints and links, and the cyclic chains that commonly arise in molecules, impose closure constraints on the kinematics that describe atom positions for given configurations.
