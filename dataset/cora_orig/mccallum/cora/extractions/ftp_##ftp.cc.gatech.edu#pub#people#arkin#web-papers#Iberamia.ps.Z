Reference-contexts: Sensorimotor neural schemas in ASL/NSL generate output to the motor schemas executing in MissionLab, either in the simulated or real world. 3 Computational Neuroethology Neuroethology, the study of the nervous system and animal behavior, has inspired a number of computational models, such as Rana Computatrix, the computational frog <ref> [1] </ref>, the computational cockroach [7], and the computational hoverfly [13]. Such computational models involve a rich number of neural based behaviors, such as the Chantlitaxia, searching from a proper habitat, taken from the Praying Mantis behavior [11], as described in the ethogram in Figure 9.

Reference-contexts: A number of schema-based architectures have been developed for different application domains, e.g. VISIONS [18], in vision ; RS (Robot Schemas) [22] and MissionLab <ref> [3] </ref>, in robotics. Based on these domain specific architectures, a unified schema computational model, ASL (Abstract Schema Language) [25], was designed with the ability to integrate with neural networks processing across different domains as well. <p> Two implementations of the system currently exist: NSLC in C++ and NSLJ in Java. 2.3 Schema-based control for autonomous robots In robotics, schemas have been used to provide the underlying software control mechanisms for a number of systems, e.g. MissionLab <ref> [3] </ref> and RS [22]. In particular, in the control of autonomous robots, such as with MissionLab, motor schemas have been encoded as a variant of the potential field methodology [21]. In this context, schemas have the following characteristics: 1.

Reference-contexts: In this context, schemas have the following characteristics: 1. Each is an independent asynchronous computational agent executing in parallel with other schemas. 2. Sensing is directly tied to motor control following the action-oriented perception paradigm, where information is obtained via sensing on a need-to-know basis <ref> [4] </ref>. 3. Each active schema produces a vector that encodes the behavioral response for a given stimulus. 4. Coordination of schemas is typically conducted via behavioral fusion: vector summation and normalization of the individual schemas outputs. 5.

As a language ASL corresponds more to a specification language rather than to an explicit programming language.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction To enable the development and execution of complex behaviors in autonomous robots involving adaptation and learning, sophisticated software architectures are required. The neural schema architecture provides such a system, supporting the development and execution of complex behaviors, or schemas [3][2], in a hierarchical and layered fashion <ref> [9] </ref> integrating with neural network processing. In general, schema theory helps define brain functionality in terms of concurrent activity of interacting behavioral units called schemas.

Reference-contexts: Different models are currently being developed under the ASL/NSL/ MissionLab neural schema architecture. Besides the Chantlitlaxia behavior [6], we have prototyped the adaptive toad's prey acquisition behavior due to a static barrier <ref> [14] </ref>, and developing a prey acquisition and predator avoidance behavior modulated by learning processes in neural networks [20]. 3.1 Prey Acquisition with Detour Behavior As an example of a model developed under the neural based schema architecture we describe the toad's detour behavior due to stationary objects on its way to <p> a prey acquisition and predator avoidance behavior modulated by learning processes in neural networks [20]. 3.1 Prey Acquisition with Detour Behavior As an example of a model developed under the neural based schema architecture we describe the toad's detour behavior due to stationary objects on its way to a prey <ref> [14] </ref>. The experiment being modeled consists of a barrier placed between a prey and a toad, as shown in Figure 10. Two different barrier sizes were tried, 10 and 20 cm. <p> This inhibition is important to avoid activating antagonist motor schemas simultaneously. A tactile modulation component provides adaptation to the model by increasing the inhibition repetitively, every time the robot hits the barrier. (The detailed model description can be found in <ref> [14] </ref>.) Autonomous Robots The complete autonomous robotic agent is built by integrating the perceptual and sensorimotor schemas in ASL/NSL with the motor schemas in MissionLab, as shown in Figure 14. <p> This process continues until the edge of the barrier is perceived, generating a direct path to the prey, as shown in Figure 17, right. This specific trajectory was generated due to the model reorientation specifics. Other simulated results, and more detailed results, can be found in <ref> [14] </ref>. 5 Conclusions and Future Work This paper has shown the fundamentals of the ASL/NSL/ MissionLab neural schema architecture for autonomous robots. A previous architecture is described in [19].
