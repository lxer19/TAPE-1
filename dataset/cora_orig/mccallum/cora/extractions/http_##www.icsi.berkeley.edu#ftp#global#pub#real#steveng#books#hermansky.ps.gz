Reference-contexts: The sequences of short term, quasi-stationary acoustic vectors are clearly correlated over time which violates the assumption of current HMM recognition formalism. It appears that the short-term memory of the auditory periphery in mammals (exhibited, e.g., by forward masking (see, e.g., [62]), the firing rate adaptation constant (see, e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>), and the buildup of loudness (see, e.g., [59])) is of the order of about 200 ms. This means that the peripheral human auditory system can effectively integrate rather large (about syllable sized) time-spans of the audio signal.

Reference-contexts: In the current main-stream ASR the entire feature vector is used as one entity and even a single corrupted spectral element can severely degrade the performance of the recog-nizer. 4.1. The human way Early Fletcher's work [23] on Articulatory Index (see <ref> [3] </ref> for a review) suggests that human auditory perception works differently than the current ASR. Specifically, Fletcher suggests that the linguistic message gets decoded independently in different frequency sub-bands and the final decoding decision is based on merging the decisions from the sub-bands.

Reference-contexts: A matched filter for such a signal would have a time constant of 250 ms. Perception of speech with modified spectral envelopes Recent experiments of Drullman [18, 19] indicate relative dominance of the modulation frequencies around 4-6 Hz for speech communication. Inspired by Drullman's experiments, Arai et al. <ref> [4] </ref> have initiated series of similar experiments using slightly different signal processing paradigm which are based on the residual-excited LPC vocoder and aiming for band-pass processing of trajectories of spectral envelopes [4]. Their results, shown in Fig. 3, confirm and extend Drullman's. <p> Inspired by Drullman's experiments, Arai et al. <ref> [4] </ref> have initiated series of similar experiments using slightly different signal processing paradigm which are based on the residual-excited LPC vocoder and aiming for band-pass processing of trajectories of spectral envelopes [4].

It indeed appears that the modulation frequencies between DC and 1 Hz, as well as the frequencies above 15 Hz, play only secondary role in speech communications. 16 [Hz]. The data points show the average over 124 trials.

Reference-contexts: One of data-based techniques is a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) which is a stochastic technique which attempts to optimize a linear discriminability between classes in presence of undesirable within-class variability (see e.g. [43] for examples of use of LDA in ASR). Avendano et al <ref> [5] </ref> have used LDA on a subsets of phoneme-labeled TIMIT database, down-sampled from its original 16 kHz down to 8 kHz, together with NTIMIT database (NTIMIT was derived from the high-quality TIMIT database by transmitting TIMIT through a conventional wire-line public switched telephone network) and NTIMIT database transmitted through a cellular <p> The frequency response of the original RASTA filter is shown by the dashed line. Filters at other critical-band frequencies are quite similar. The similarity of magnitude frequency characteristics of such derived filters and the original ad hoc designed RASTA filter is striking. Additionally, <ref> [5] </ref> also describes and gives result of quite different data-driven filter design technique which yields very similar frequency characteristics as the LDA technique described above. So it appears that the filter shape is indeed reflecting underlying properties of the signal rather than artifacts of the design method. 4.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the bandwidths of the PLP model preserve information about spread of the underlying formant clusters, thus alleviating a fundamental objection <ref> [24, 6] </ref> to the F2' concept (see [31] for evidence and discussion). * Hermansky and Broad [37, 11] speculate that one of reasons for intelligibility of child speech might be ability of human speech perception to simplify particular formant structure and to focus on global and less speaker-dependent spectral properties which

Reference-contexts: Some researchers in auditory modeling began to explicitly model temporal properties of human hearing [13, 58]. The main emphasis in these models seemed to be on relatively short-term temporal phenomena. More recently, techniques such as Multi-Vector Input [51] combined either with MLP <ref> [7, 46, 60] </ref> or with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) [44], [12],[27], Dynamic (Delta) Features [25], RASTA Processing [35], short-term cepstral mean removal [57], Dynamic Cepstrum [2], or Probabilistic Optimum Filtering [53], are emerging as a post-processing techniques which operate on a sequences of the short-term feature vectors.
