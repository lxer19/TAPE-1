Abstract: Current approaches for detecting periodic motion assume a stationary camera and place limits on an object's motion. These approaches rely on the assumption that a periodic motion projects to a set of periodic image curves, an assumption that fails in general. Using affine-invariance, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for an image sequence to be the projection of a periodic motion. No restrictions are placed on either the motion of the camera or the object. Our algorithm is shown to be provably-correct for noise-free data and is easily extended to be robust with respect to occlusions and noise. The extended algorithm is evaluated with real and synthetic image sequences.

Reference-contexts: The key observation is that effects due to both (1) and (2) can be modeled by affine transformations so we can make use of recent results in affine-invariance <ref> [1] </ref>. The support of the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos. IRI-9022608 and IRI-9220782 is gratefully acknowledged. Periodicity is remarkable in that it can be detected without taking into account the structure of objects in a scene. <p> The observation follows directly from the definitions of Section 3. Now consider the projection of an affinely-periodic motion. Clearly, corresponding frames from different cycles will be projections of affine transformations of the same object. Here we can use the result, due to Tomasi and Kanade <ref> [1] </ref>, that the matrix formed by the registered concatenation of affinely corresponding frames has rank at most 3. <p> measurement matrix of frame F i and period p as M i = fi fi fi fi F i . . . fi fi fi fi fi The measurement matrix can be registered to eliminate effects due to translation by subtracting each row's centroid from each element in the row <ref> [1] </ref>.

Denote the registered version of M p p Match Criterion and [1], ^ M p i can be expressed as ^ M i = RS (4) where R is 2k by 3 and S is 3 by n. Since ^ M p product of two rank 3 (or less) matrices, ^ M p i is itself of rank at most 3. <p> Therefore, an affinely-periodic motion produces registered measurement matrices of rank at most 3. Conversely, any registered measurement matrix of rank 3 or less can be decomposed as in Eq. (4) using singular value decomposition <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Periodicity is remarkable in that it can be detected without taking into account the structure of objects in a scene. Therefore periodicity information can be detected at an early stage and used by higher level processes of a motion-analysis system. A problem in current motion recognition systems <ref> [2, 3] </ref> is temporal alignment; it is difficult to match two motions that are out of phase or have different periods. The latter difficulty is resolved by detecting the period at an early stage in the visual analysis process. <p> To model the human torso, we used nine parallelepipeds connected by revolute joints. The periodic motion consisted of a sequence of joint angles extrapolated from real motion data of a human running, provided by Goddard <ref> [2] </ref>. We found the algorithm to be robust to both feature noise and perspective effects; the period with the highest confidence was always a multiple of the correct period. The most visible effect of noise and perspective was a gradual degradation of confidence values (see Fig. 1).

One might hope to replace Step 3 with a Fourier transform and deduce the fundamental frequency (and hence the period) as in <ref> [5] </ref>. However, this modification is theoretically unjustified due to the fact that M (i) 6= M (i + p) in general, with the true period p and ideal data.
