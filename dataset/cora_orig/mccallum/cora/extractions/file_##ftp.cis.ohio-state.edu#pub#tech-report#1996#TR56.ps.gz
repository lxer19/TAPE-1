Title: Distributed Dynamic Carrier Allocation in Mobile Cellular Networks: Search vs. Update

Abstract: There are two approaches for distributed dynamic carrier allocation algorithms: update and search. This paper investigates the fundamental differences between the two approaches. We present two simple, representative schemes, namely the basic update scheme and the basic search scheme. We will argue that for two reasons the update approach is more appropriate for mobile cellular networks that support real-time communications. First, it is hard to support carrier reallocations with the search approach. Second, the search approach usually incurs longer delay during carrier acquisitions than the update approach. We then propose a new update scheme that is more efficient than the basic update scheme in terms of message complexity and carrier acquisition delay. Our simulation results show that, compared to the basic update scheme, the new update scheme not only cuts the average carrier acquisition delay by 60% to 95%, but also reduces the average number of messages required per carrier acquisition by almost 50%.

Reference-contexts: This model is the same as that adopted by the GSM pan-European mobile radio network [11], the Nanda-Goodman DCA strategy [12], and the Geometric DCA strategy <ref> [1] </ref>. A carrier is available for a cell if its use in the cell will cause no co-channel interference. When a cell needs a carrier, it acquires one from the set of all available carriers. It involves three tasks: 1. <p> As distributed systems provide better reliability and scalability, distributed DCA algorithms are preferable to centralized algorithms. DCA strategies (task 2) have been extensively studied <ref> [1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 14, 17] </ref>. By contrast, tasks 1 and 3 have only recently attracted researchers' interest, mainly because earlier cellular networks employed centralized DCA algorithms, in which tasks 1 and 3 are trivial. <p> We then propose a more efficient update scheme which takes advantage of resource planning required by many DCA strategies, such as various channel borrowing strategies [5, 7, 17], the Geometric static-priority DCA strategy <ref> [1] </ref>, the Column-Wise static-priority DCA strategy [8], and the Column-Wise hybrid-priority DCA strategy [8]. The new update scheme, as will be seen, is similar to the basic search scheme in terms of message complexity. We implement the basic update scheme as well as our new update scheme. <p> For instance, in the channel borrowing strategies [5, 7, 17], each cell is allocated a set of nominal carriers beforehand; in the Geometric DCA strategy <ref> [1] </ref>, each cell must know its first-choice carriers prior to any carrier acquisition. We call the process of assigning special status to carriers resource planning. Resource Planning 1.

Reference-contexts: When all the channels in a carrier are free, the carrier may be released so that other cells in its interference neighborhood can acquire the carrier. 2.3 Intra-cell Handoff There are two operations which have been shown to be important in achieving better overall carrier reuse <ref> [2, 4] </ref>: channel switch and carrier switch. In a channel switch operation, an MH releases its current channel and is assigned a new channel. With channel switch operations, each cell can support MHs with a minimum number of carriers.

We simulate the behavior of the two schemes under both uniform and non-uniform traffic distributions, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Due to the distributed nature of the two basic schemes, an MSS communicates with other MSSs in its interference neighborhood via message passing. We assume that communications between MSSs are First-In-First-Out (FIFO) and communication delay is arbitrary but finite. We use Lamport's logical clock scheme <ref> [9] </ref> to assign timestamps to events so that events occurred at different MSSs can be totally ordered by their timestamps. 3.1 The Basic Update Scheme In the basic update scheme (Fig. 2), three types of messages exchanged among MSSs: request messages, response messages and inform messages.

Reference-contexts: In the search approach, cells do not maintain the set of available carriers. When a cell needs a carrier, it searches all neighboring cells to compute the set of currently available carriers, and then acquires one according to the underlying DCA strategy. The distributed DCA algorithm <ref> [13] </ref> takes the search approach. We first investigate the pros and cons of the two approaches. We present a simple, representative scheme for each approach, namely the basic update scheme and the basic search scheme.

Reference-contexts: A carrier allocation algorithm is a procedure that carries out all of the three tasks. One may regard a carrier allocation algorithm as an implementation of a (carrier allocation) strategy. Carrier allocation strategies can be classified into three categories: fixed strategies, flexible strategies, and dynamic strategies <ref> [16] </ref>. (Carrier allocation is usually referred to as channel allocation when each carrier contains only one channel.) It is well known that dynamic carrier allocation (DCA) strategies in general can achieve lower blocking rate than fixed or flexible strategies.
