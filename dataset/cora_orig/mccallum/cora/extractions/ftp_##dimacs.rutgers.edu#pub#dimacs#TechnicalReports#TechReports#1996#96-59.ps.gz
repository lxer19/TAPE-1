Reference-contexts: Remark 1 An optimal Steiner tree can be found exactly in O (n k ) time.

It is known that STP in the rectilinear metric (a sub-case of 4-sparse STP) is N P -complete but the question whether it is MAX SNP-hard or not is still open. <p> In an *-dense instance of STP (for some * &lt; 1) any terminal has at least *n neighbors outside S. Note that for * &gt; 1 2 , *-dense STP is a sub-case of Network STP with distances 1 and 2 which is still MAX SNP-complete <ref> [4] </ref>. The Rayward-Smith heuristic [8] was proposed for the latter problem in [4]. It achieves a better approximation guarantee ( 4 3 ) then MSTH which has the tight bound 2 as for the general case. MSTH also does not differ the dense and general case of STP. <p> Note that for * &gt; 1 2 , *-dense STP is a sub-case of Network STP with distances 1 and 2 which is still MAX SNP-complete <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The Set Cover Problem (SCP) asks for a minimum size sub-family M of P such that X [fpjp 2 M g. The greedy heuristic gives 1 + lnk approximation for SCP <ref> [5] </ref>. Moreover, SCP cannot be approximated to within less than ln k-factor unless N P DT IME [n loglogn ] [6]. The B-sparse SCP has a constant upper bound B &gt; 1 on the number of sets in P which cover the same element of X.

The B-sparse SCP has a constant upper bound B &gt; 1 on the number of sets in P which cover the same element of X. The Vertex Cover Problem is a well-known representative of B-sparse SCP (B=2). There is a simple B-approximation algorithm for this problem.

Reference-contexts: The Steiner Tree Problem (STP) asks for a minimum size tree within G which spans all terminals from S. Further, d (F ) denotes the length of a graph F , jSj = k and jV j = n. A well-known minimum spanning tree heuristic (MSTH) <ref> [9] </ref> finds a minimum spanning tree M of a weighted complete graph G 0 = (S; E 0 ; c), where the weight of any edge equals to the length of the shortest path between its ends in G. <p> Using MSTH we can find an optimal Steiner tree if we add all Steiner points to the terminal set. Remark 1 An optimal Steiner tree can be found exactly in O (n k ) time. MSTH gives 2-approximation for STP <ref> [9] </ref> and the best up-today polynomial-time approximation guarantee is about 1.644 [7]. From the other side, STP is known to be MAX SNP complete [4]. - 3 - In the B-sparse STP the degree of any vertex is bounded by a constant B.

Reference-contexts: If the number of terminals is small enough, i.e. k 1 * , then we can find an exact solution in polynomial time. Otherwise, we apply to the dense STP the following variant of Rayward-Smith heuristic (or the greedy algorithm <ref> [10] </ref>).
