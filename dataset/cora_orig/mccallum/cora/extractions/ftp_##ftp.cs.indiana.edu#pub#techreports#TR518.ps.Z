Reference-contexts: The formulation of the quaternion form of the differential equations for frame evolution was introduced as early as the 1890's by Tait [41]. 5 f are intended to be straight. For basic information on orientation spaces and their relationship to quaternions, see, e.g., <ref> [1, 33, 25] </ref>. Our own conventions are summarized in the appendix. The task of visualizing quaternions is also important, and we will describe our own approach below; for an interesting alternative, see Hart, Francis, and Kauffman [21]. <p> This is no surprise, since SO (2) and its double covering spin group are subgroups of the corresponding 3D rotation groups, and complex numbers are a subset of the quaternions. 3D Quaternion Frames We next outline the basic features of quaternion frames; see, e.g., <ref> [1] </ref> for a nice textbook treatment of quaternions and their properties. A quaternion frame is a four-vector q = (q 0 ; q 1 ; q 2 ; q 3 ) = (q 0 ; ~q) with the following features: * Unit Norm.

Reference-contexts: 3D, the spline path need not pass through the constraint lines. (c) In this paper, our sample points are generally close enough together that we apply the constraints to piecewise linear splines analogous to those shown here. question of optimal freely moving frames treated by the minimal-tangential-acceleration methods (see, e.g., <ref> [2, 34, 11] </ref>); we are instead concerned with closely-spaced points on curves and surfaces where one direction of the frame is already fixed, and the chosen functional minimization in quaternion space must obey the additional constraint imposed by the fixed family of directions. <p> The choice of minimal area for surface frames is more heuristic, basically a plausibility argument that the generalization of minimal length is minimal area; no doubt this could be made more rigorous. By imposing other criteria such as endpoint derivative values and minimal bending energy (see Barr et al. <ref> [2, 34] </ref>), the short straight line segments and polygons that result from the simplest minimization could be smoothed to become generalized splines passing through the required constraint rings; since, in practice, our curve and surface samplings are arbitrarily dense, this was not pursued in the current investigation. <p> On a surface, the resulting paths are essentially geodesics, but, as noted in Figure 2, there is no obvious analog of a global parallel transport approach to surface framing. * Minimal Acceleration. Barr, Currin, Gabriel, and Hughes <ref> [2] </ref> proposed a direct generalization of the no-acceleration criterion of cubic Euclidean splines for quaternion curves constrained to the three-sphere; the basic concept was to globally minimize the squared tangential acceleration experienced by a curve of unit quaternions. <p> This degree of freedom corresponds to a relatively common sliding ring constraint that occurs frequently in minimization problems. General packages for solving constraints are mentioned in Barr, et al. <ref> [2] </ref>, who chose MINOS [30]. For our own experiments, we have chosen Brakke's Surface Evolver package [6], which has a very simple interface for handling parametric constraints as boundary conditions, and can be used for a wide variety of general optimization problems. <p> the other hand, if we want special conditions for certain parameter values, it is easy to fix any number of particular orientations at other points on the curve, just as we fixed the starting points above; derivative values and smoothness constraints leading to generalized splines can be similarly specified (see <ref> [2] </ref>). Surface Patch Framings. A classic simple example of a surface patch framing problem was presented in the discussion of Figures 2 and 22. <p> For ordinary camera control interpolation, one could constrain any direction of the camera frame to be fixed by calculating its appropriate constraint ring in the quaternion Gauss map, and then extend a method like that of Barr et al. <ref> [2, 34] </ref>) to smoothly compute intermediate frames subject to the constraints.

Reference-contexts: Mathematically speaking, the space of possible frames is the circular Hopf fiber lying above the point in S 2 corresponding to each specific curve tangent or surface normal (see, e.g., <ref> [39, 3] </ref>). For space curves, specifying a frame assignment as a quaternion path leads at once to tubular surfaces that provide a thickened representation of the curve that interacts well with lighting and rendering models. <p> the Gauss map are nontrivial quadratic forms constructed from all the quaternion components; however, a projection to a subspace of the quaternion space based on the bilinear action of quaternions on pure vectors may be constructed by imitating the projection of the Hopf fibration of S 3 (see, e.g., Shoemake <ref> [39, 3] </ref>). In Figure 15, we show two such cases, an ellipsoid with orthonormal polar coordinates singular at the poles and a torus with global, nonsingular, coordinates, using our now-standard projections of the quaternion Gauss map to 3D.

Reference-contexts: In general, one can imagine wanting to minimize the total twisting, the aggregate angular acceleration, etc., subject to a variety of boundary conditions. A bewildering variety of energy functions to minimize can be found in the literature (see, e.g., <ref> [6] </ref>). We summarize a selection of such criteria for choosing a space of frames below, with the caveat that one certainly may think of others! * Minimal Length and Area. The most obvious criterion is to minimize the total turning angle experienced by the curve frames. <p> This degree of freedom corresponds to a relatively common sliding ring constraint that occurs frequently in minimization problems.

Reference-contexts: The more mathematical approach requires that interesting surfaces be defined as a collection of patches <ref> [13, 7] </ref>, and the spaces of frames for each patch must be matched up and sewn together by assigning a transition function along the boundaries. <p> There are a variety of ways one can approach the problem of taking a manifold and associating fiber bundles with it; the most relevant fiber bundle for the context of the current problem is the space of moving frames of the space R 3 in which the surface is embedded <ref> [7, 40] </ref>. We in fact move as usual from the space of frames to the space of associated quaternions.

Reference-contexts: This phenomenon is a practical consequence of the fact that the two-sphere does not admit a global vector field: according to classical manifold theory (see, e.g., Milnor or Grimm and Hughes <ref> [29, 13] </ref>), one needs at least two separate patches, one for the North pole and one for the South pole, to place a complete set of coordinates (or equivalently, for our problem, a set of frames) on a sphere. <p> The more mathematical approach requires that interesting surfaces be defined as a collection of patches <ref> [13, 7] </ref>, and the spaces of frames for each patch must be matched up and sewn together by assigning a transition function along the boundaries. <p> Although the locally optimal patches cannot be globally joined to one another, we conjecture that some applications might benefit from the next best thing: matching boundary frames of neighboring patches using transitional rotations (see, e.g., <ref> [29, 13] </ref>). We have carried this out explicitly for simple cases, but omit it here for brevity. Extensions to Other Domains.

Reference-contexts: remaining 3 parameters by considering transformation by right multiplication to be an independent operation, resulting in a similar matrix but with the signs in the lower right-hand off-diagonal 3 fi 3 section reversed. (This corresponds to the well-known decomposition of the 4D rotation group into two 3D rotations; see, e.g., <ref> [14] </ref>.) If two quaternions a and b are transformed by multiplying them by the same quaternion p, their inner product a b transforms as (p fl a) (p fl b) = (a b)(p p) (57) and so is invariant if p is a unit quaternion frame representing a rotation.

Reference-contexts: Among these are extrusion methods and generalized cones in geometric modeling, the imposition of constraints on a camera-frame axis in key-frame animation, and the selection of a 2D array of camera-frame axis choices as a condition on a constrained-navigation environment (see, e.g., Hanson and Wernert <ref> [20] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Additional references of interest, especially regarding the treatment of surfaces, include <ref> [22, 32] </ref>. our constrained problem: a typical spline minimizes the bending energy specified by the chosen anchor points; requiring intermediate points to slide on constrained paths during the minimization modifies the problem.

Another possible application could be the determination of optimal configurations for long-chain molecules and similar 1D and 2D structures.

Reference-contexts: Methodology. We focus on unit quaternion representations of coordinate frames because of the well-known natural structure of unit quaternions as points on the three-sphere S 3 , which admits a natural distance measure for defining optimization problems, and supports in addition a variety of regular frame-interpolation methods (see, e.g., <ref> [37, 35, 31, 23] </ref>). <p> If for some reason one must pass through or near certain specified frames with possible derivative constraints, then a direct spline construction in the quaternion space may actually be preferred; see, e.g., <ref> [37, 35, 31, 39, 23] </ref>. Most splines can 41 be viewed in some sense as solving an optimization problem with various constraints and conditions, and so the keyframe problem essentially reverts again to an optimization. General Remarks.

While the classical frames have many funda-mentally appealing mathematical properties, we are not in fact restricted to use any one of them. Keeping the tangent vector field intact, we may modify the angle of rotation about the tangent vector at will to produce an application-dependent frame assignment.

Special simplifications do occur for the 4D case, however, allowing a treatment in terms of pairs of unit quaternions (see, e.g., [15]); this case must in fact be investigated to produce a more rigorous formulation of the 4D surface tubings proposed in [17].

A careful mathematical treatment by Bishop [4] presents its differential properties in a form that can be easily compared with the standard features of the Frenet frame.

Reference-contexts: This phenomenon is a practical consequence of the fact that the two-sphere does not admit a global vector field: according to classical manifold theory (see, e.g., Milnor or Grimm and Hughes <ref> [29, 13] </ref>), one needs at least two separate patches, one for the North pole and one for the South pole, to place a complete set of coordinates (or equivalently, for our problem, a set of frames) on a sphere. <p> Although the locally optimal patches cannot be globally joined to one another, we conjecture that some applications might benefit from the next best thing: matching boundary frames of neighboring patches using transitional rotations (see, e.g., <ref> [29, 13] </ref>). We have carried this out explicitly for simple cases, but omit it here for brevity. Extensions to Other Domains.

General packages for solving constraints are mentioned in Barr, et al. [2], who chose MINOS <ref> [30] </ref>. For our own experiments, we have chosen Brakke's Surface Evolver package [6], which has a very simple interface for handling parametric constraints as boundary conditions, and can be used for a wide variety of general optimization problems.

Reference-contexts: 3D, the spline path need not pass through the constraint lines. (c) In this paper, our sample points are generally close enough together that we apply the constraints to piecewise linear splines analogous to those shown here. question of optimal freely moving frames treated by the minimal-tangential-acceleration methods (see, e.g., <ref> [2, 34, 11] </ref>); we are instead concerned with closely-spaced points on curves and surfaces where one direction of the frame is already fixed, and the chosen functional minimization in quaternion space must obey the additional constraint imposed by the fixed family of directions. <p> The choice of minimal area for surface frames is more heuristic, basically a plausibility argument that the generalization of minimal length is minimal area; no doubt this could be made more rigorous. By imposing other criteria such as endpoint derivative values and minimal bending energy (see Barr et al. <ref> [2, 34] </ref>), the short straight line segments and polygons that result from the simplest minimization could be smoothed to become generalized splines passing through the required constraint rings; since, in practice, our curve and surface samplings are arbitrarily dense, this was not pursued in the current investigation. <p> For ordinary camera control interpolation, one could constrain any direction of the camera frame to be fixed by calculating its appropriate constraint ring in the quaternion Gauss map, and then extend a method like that of Barr et al. <ref> [2, 34] </ref>) to smoothly compute intermediate frames subject to the constraints.

Reference-contexts: While it would be possible in many applications to ignore this mismatch, it has been the subject of a wide variety of previous papers (see, e.g., <ref> [24, 36, 5] </ref>), and must obviously be repaired for many other applications such as those requiring textured periodic tubes. corners of the patch are always well-defined (a), one finds two different frames for the bottom corner depending upon whether one parallel transports the initial frame around the left-hand path (b) or <p> Background.

Reference-contexts: Mathematically speaking, the space of possible frames is the circular Hopf fiber lying above the point in S 2 corresponding to each specific curve tangent or surface normal (see, e.g., <ref> [39, 3] </ref>). For space curves, specifying a frame assignment as a quaternion path leads at once to tubular surfaces that provide a thickened representation of the curve that interacts well with lighting and rendering models. <p> the Gauss map are nontrivial quadratic forms constructed from all the quaternion components; however, a projection to a subspace of the quaternion space based on the bilinear action of quaternions on pure vectors may be constructed by imitating the projection of the Hopf fibration of S 3 (see, e.g., Shoemake <ref> [39, 3] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: There are a variety of ways one can approach the problem of taking a manifold and associating fiber bundles with it; the most relevant fiber bundle for the context of the current problem is the space of moving frames of the space R 3 in which the surface is embedded <ref> [7, 40] </ref>.
