Abstract: The construction of quadratic C 1 surfaces from B-spline control points is generalized to a wider class of control meshes capable of outlining arbitrary free-form surfaces in space. Irregular meshes with non quadrilateral cells and more or fewer than four cells meeting at a point are allowed so that arbitrary free-form surfaces with or without boundary can be modeled in the same conceptual frame work as tensor-product B-splines. That is, the mesh points serve as control points of a smooth piecewise polynomial surface representation that is local, evaluates by averaging and obeys the convex hull property. For a regular region of the input mesh, the representation reduces to the standard quadratic spline. In general, any surface spline can be represented by Bernstein-Bezier patches of degree two and three. According to the user's choice, these patches can be polynomial or rational, three-sided, four-sided or a combination thereof.

Reference-contexts: In summary, one would like a representation that departs as little as possible from the widely used non uniform rational B-spline standard and combines the intuitive cutting paradigm (see e.g. <ref> [4] </ref>) with a low degree parametrization. The representation described in this paper generalizes the quadratic C 1 spline paradigm for both tensor-product B-splines and four-direction box splines: the input mesh serves as control mesh and blend or cut ratios act like knot spacings.

(For details on the Bernstein-Bezier form and box spline form see [3], [12] and <ref> [5] </ref>. The three-sided and mixed surface spline developed in this paper satisfy all the above properties. <p> By Theorem 3.3, the surface is C 1 and the connecting map the identity. Therefore the patches join parametrically C 1 and are the quadratic four direction box spline corresponding to the subcell centers C i (cf. <ref> [5] </ref>). Next, we analyse the four-sided patch construction of Steps 4R-6R.

Reference-contexts: This not only makes it tricky to establish elementary properties like tangent plane continuity of the limit surface, but is also a major obstacle for integrating the techniques with other numerical and computer aided design representations. The work on reparametrization and geometric smoothness by numerous researchers (see <ref> [14] </ref> for a survey) is an essential tool for deriving surface splines. Algorithms like [29], [31], [16] have constructed smooth surfaces from meshes of data, the latter even with kth order continuity.
