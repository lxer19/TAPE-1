Title: Database Security Issues for Real-Time Electronic Commerce Systems  
Author: Sang H. Son

Abstract: Data management and transaction processing are essential in supporting advanced time-critical applications. In many of these applications, security is another important requirement. Security is especially critical in electronic commerce applications where databases often maintain and provide sensitive information. In electronic commerce, service providers are sensitive to the needs of the clients, including the implicit (or explicit) timing constraints. If providing full security to each activity causes the system to become less timely, the service providers would be reluctant in providing necessary security guarantees. Therefore, it is important to consider multiple security service levels for applications such as electronic commerce. In this paper we address issues that the system designers should consider for supporting both requirements of timeliness and security. We discuss the issues for transaction and data modeling, and present the notion of partial security. We also discuss a specification language that allows the designer to specify important properties of the database at an appropriate level to support partial security.

Reference-contexts: For example, a priori knowledge of the attributes of a transaction is sometimes available for some soft real-time transactions and should be utilized to improve the system performance. Much work has been already done for Class III transactions <ref> [Abbo92, Lam97, Lee96] </ref>. To support security and timeliness requirements in database systems for electronic commerce, it will be useful to classify different types of transactions based on their security requirements, and develop processing schemes for each type of transactions.

Reference-contexts: While discretionary access control has been used in several systems, it may not be adequate for preventing unauthorized disclosure of the information [Woo83]. The most well-known model for multilevel security is the Bell-LaPadula model <ref> [Bell76] </ref>. In the Bell-LaPadula model, security policies are stated in terms of subjects and objects. A subject is an active entity that can access objects. Every object is assigned a classification, and every subject a clearance.

Reference-contexts: Several different types of transactions may need to be executed on the databases. For example, in stock trading application, the database should keep track of several hundreds of thousands of financial instruments world-wide. The stream of update requests can be up to 500 updates/second during peek time <ref> [Coch94] </ref>. Many of them could be periodic while some others could be triggered to compute indices or other composite values on request. At the same time, clients of the system may submit transactions to check the price and perform trading on specific stocks.

Reference-contexts: To improve the timeliness in secure and time-critical applications such as electronic commerce, several issues need to be carefully considered. The research in this area has been focused on identifying architectural and transaction processing issues <ref> [Geo97, Muk97, Park97, Son93, Son95, Son97, Son98] </ref>. It was suggested that a more rigorous model to capture the characteristics and semantics of transactions and data is necessary. This will enable efficient processing to improve the timeliness of the system.

Reference-contexts: A database is a critical infrastructure that is essential in electronic commerce to support complex and flexible services to manage requests in the context of highly dynamic workload with diverged requirements <ref> [Ghosh98] </ref>. Security is critical in electronic commerce applications where the system often manages sensitive information (such as credit card numbers and account passwords). Building blocks of such an application should ensure security and timeliness to provide mechanisms for searching, negotiating, ordering, billing, payment, distribution, contracting, and other client-specific services.

Reference-contexts: A timing channel arises when a resource or object in the database is shared between subjects with different access classes. One way to eliminate covert channels is to design a system that meets the requirements of non-interference <ref> [Gog84] </ref>. From our earlier study, it became clear that security requirements are not compatible with real-time requirements [Son93, Son95]. Frequently, priority inversion is necessary to avoid covert channels.

Reference-contexts: Various security-assurance techniques can be used, ranging from user authentication using encrypted passwords for the database to encrypted storage of highly sensitive data in the database. We have developed a model for data and transactions for both soft and critical real-time systems <ref> [Kim96] </ref>. The model provides a strong basis not only for performance study of real-time transactions but also characteristics and requirements of real-time database systems to support different classes of transactions. In that model, a real-time database consists of a set of data objects representing the state of an external world.

Reference-contexts: The Bell-LaPadula model prevents direct flow of information from a higher access class to a lower access class, but the conditions are not sufficient to ensure that security is not violated indirectly through what is known as covert channels <ref> [Lamp73] </ref>. A covert channel allows indirect transfer of information from a subject at a higher access class to a subject at a lower access class. An important class of covert channels that are usually associated with concurrency control mechanisms are timing channels.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction A real-time system is one whose basic specification and design correctness arguments must include its ability to meet its timing constraints. This implies that its correctness depends not only on the logical correctness, but also on the timeliness of its actions <ref> [Shin94] </ref>. To function correctly, it must produce a correct result within a specified time, called deadline.
