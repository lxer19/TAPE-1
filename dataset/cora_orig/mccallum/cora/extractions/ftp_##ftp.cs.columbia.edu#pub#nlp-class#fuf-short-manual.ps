Abstract: This document is the user manual for FUF version 5.2, a natural language generator program that uses the technique of unification grammars. The program is composed of two main modules: a unifier and a linearizer. The unifier takes as input a semantic description of the text to be generated and a unification grammar, and produces as output a rich syntactic description of the text. The linearizer interprets this syntactic description and produces an English sentence. This manual includes a detailed presentation of the technique of unification grammars and a reference manual for the current implementation (FUF 5.2). Version 5.2 includes novel techniques in the unification allowing the specification of types and the expression of complete information. It also allows for procedural unification and supports sophisticated forms of control.
