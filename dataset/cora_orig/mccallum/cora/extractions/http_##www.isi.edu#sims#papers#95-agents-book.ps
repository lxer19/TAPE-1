Abstract: With the vast number of information resources available today, a critical problem is how to locate, retrieve and process information. It is impractical to build a single unified system that combines all of these information resources. A more modular approach is to build specialized information agents where each agent provides access to a subset of these resources and can serve as an information source to other agents. In this paper we present the architecture of the individual information agents and describe how this architecture supports a network of cooperating information agents. We describe how these information agents represent their knowledge, communicate with other agents, dynamically construct information retrieval plans, and learn about other agents to improve their accuracy and efficiency. We have already built a small network of agents that have these capabilities and provide access to information for logistics planning. With the growing number of information sources available, the problem of how to combine distributed, heterogeneous information sources becomes more and more critical. The available information sources include traditional databases, flat files, knowledge bases, programs, etc. Traditional approaches to building distributed or federated systems do not scale well to the large, diverse, and growing number of information sources. Recent Internet systems such as World Wide Web browsers allow users to search through large numbers of information sources, but provide very limited capabilities for locating, combining, processing, and organizing information. A promising approach to this problem is to provide access to the large number of information sources by organizing them into a network of information agents [ Papazoglou et al., 1992 ] . The goal of each agent is to provide information and expertise on a specific topic by drawing on relevant information from other information agents. To build such a network, we need an architecture for a single agent that can be instantiated to provide multiple agents. We will base our design on our previous work on SIMS [ Arens et al., 1993, Knoblock et al., 1994, Arens et al., 1995 ] , an information mediator that provides access to heterogeneous data and knowledge bases. This chapter focuses on the design of an individual (SIMS) agent and discusses the issues that arise in using this design to build a network of information gathering agents. In Section 1.2, we present an approach to organizing a group of information agents.
