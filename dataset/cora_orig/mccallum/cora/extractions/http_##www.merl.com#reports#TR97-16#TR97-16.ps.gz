Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, the winning drawing, shown in Figure 2, is an excellent visualization of the graph data. It was produced by Vladimir Batagelj and Andrej Mrvar ([Vladimir.Batagelj, Andrej.Mrvar]@uni-lj.si) from the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, using the "Pajek" system (see http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek/). They used Ward's hierarchical clustering technique to compute vertex clusters <ref> [1] </ref>, which were then rearranged automatically to minimize edge crossings. A final refinement of vertex locations was performed manually. 2.3 Graph C This graph contains 452 nodes and 768 edges. It was extracted from a large telephone-call database. Graphs like this are used in fraud investigations.

Reference-contexts: The embedding was augmented by hand, and then edges were drawn using Tamassia's bend-minimization algorithm [8]. In contrast, Kaufmann used a spring embedder [6] and direct manipulation to unfold the original graph and uncover symmetries. He then used the MERL-TR-97-16 October 1997 2 "Kandinsky" approach <ref> [5] </ref>, augmented with some ideas from [8], to draw the edges with a minimum number of bends. 2.2 Graph B This graph contains 47 nodes and 264 edges. It represents a collection of WWW pages in which pages of similar content have been linked automatically.

Reference-contexts: For example, Ziegler and Mutzel based their drawing on a planar embedding of a maximal subgraph [7]. The embedding was augmented by hand, and then edges were drawn using Tamassia's bend-minimization algorithm [8].
