Abstract: This paper presents a partial solution to a component of the problem of lexical choice: choosing the synonym most typical, or expected, in context. We apply a new statistical approach to representing the context of a word through lexical co-occurrence networks. The implementation was trained and evaluated on a large corpus, and results show that the inclusion of second-order co-occurrence relations improves the performance of our implemented lexical choice program.

Reference-contexts: Knowledge-based approaches to representing the potentially subtle differences between synonyms have suffered from a serious lexical acquisition bottleneck (Di-Marco, Hirst, and Stede, 1993; Hirst, 1995). Statistical approaches, which have sought to explicitly represent differences between pairs of synonyms with respect to their occurrence with other specific words <ref> (Church et al., 1994) </ref>, are inefficient in time and space. This paper presents a new statistical approach to modeling context that provides a preliminary solution to an important sub-problem, that of determining the near-synonym that is most typical, or expected, if any, in a given context. <p> We use the intersection of two well-known measures of significance, mutual information scores and t-scores <ref> (Church et al., 1994) </ref>, to determine if a (first-order) co-occurrence relation should be included in the network; however, we use just the t-scores in computing significance scores for all the relations.
