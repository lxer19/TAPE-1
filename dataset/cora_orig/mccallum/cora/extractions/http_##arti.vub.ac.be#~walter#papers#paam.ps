Title: Mediation Agents in Multi-Party Decision Making: An Experiment  
Author: Walter Van de Velde 
Address: Pleinlaan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium  
Affiliation: Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Vrije Universiteit Brussel  
Abstract: This paper 1 describes an experiment that has been implemented on WWW in the context of a feasibility study for mediation support in geographical planning and decision making processes. The paper outlines the main goals of the follow-up project, GEOMED, in preparation of which this study was performed. It describes the concrete goals of the experiment, the architectural and technical elements used, and an extensive example scenario. A conclusion summarizes the implications of the feasibility study.

Reference-contexts: In environmental matters this is particularly evident in procedures where public consultation, deliberate delay periods, counter-expertise and room for negotiations are provided for. For a similar argument from the legal domain, see <ref> [Alexy, 1989] </ref>. Compu- tational dialectics, from which the conceptual foundations of the GEOMED approach to mediation are also derived, is described in [Gordon, 1995]. A second feature of our approach is the use of different classes of software agents ([Wooldridge and Jennings, 1994]) for realizing agent-based interaction (e.g. [Wood, 1994]).

Reference-contexts: This life-cycle is, of course, not a straightforward and predictable sequence of steps, at least not in interesting cases. In comparison to software engineering (e.g., <ref> [Boehm, 1988] </ref>), it is much closer to a spiral model, an interest driven one, than to a waterfall model. One can compare it to a risk-driven spiral model where the risk is that a certain interest will not be satisfied.

Reference-contexts: The notion of document (in the sense of a structured and dedicated view on a heterogeneous collection of data) was not very much present in the above experiments. It is through the discussions in the GEOMED-F feasibility project <ref> [Consortium, 1995] </ref> that its central role has been clarified. In our view now, we view the document and the mediation processes as two sides of the same coin. The mediation process is the life-cycle of a document. <p> The above evaluation is mainly a technical one. The actual usability of the system by a real- world group of end-users has not been extensively investigated. A preliminary analysis of the user-requirements for this kind of applications is also described in <ref> [Consortium, 1995] </ref>. It is quite clear from the illustrations in this paper that the interface requires some work to make this usable. It is currently a direct 'window on the architecture' and definitely not end-user oriented. <p> This experiment was performed within the GEOMED-F feasibility project (GMD, TNO, LIFIA, VUB AI-Lab) funded by the EEC Telematics Program, In- formation Engineering (IE 174). This article is largely based on an excerpt from this project's final report <ref> [Consortium, 1995] </ref>. The concepts, views and techniques presented in this paper are this authors interpretation and not necessarily those officially adhered to by the GEOMED project, the full follow-up project of GEOMED-F.

Reference-contexts: We call these page fragments. The actual document is then described in terms of these higher level constructs, that are composed into page types. For page fragments and page types a higher level page description language is being developed <ref> [Geldof, 1996] </ref>. Another problem with the scripting language arises from the fact that the HTTP protocol is state-less. This is one of the reasons why the server must maintain state itself, by building up a local database. <p> The solution of using Unix DBM files was one of convenience, but it is clear that a full blown relational or object oriented data store would be a better solution. In our current experiments (e.g. <ref> [Geldof, 1996] </ref>) we use the public domain relational data base MSQL. Related to the previous point, note that the current implementation uses similar storage 22 for the information that is required for the implementation, and for the information that is domain specific and typically viewed in the documents. <p> There is currently no notion of traveling agents. An agent resides on a one server, and it does not move to others. A variety of these issues have since been attacked. For example, [Schrooten, 1996] elaborates on the notions of locations and personal agents, while in <ref> [Geldof, 1996] </ref> the generation of documents from a high level page description language is being investigated. The above evaluation is mainly a technical one. The actual usability of the system by a real- world group of end-users has not been extensively investigated.

Reference-contexts: The idea of a personal agent is that it acts as an electronic representative, and accumulates information about its authority (owner of the agent). Such an agent can facilitate navigation, help to fill out forms, directly communicate with other agents and so on <ref> [Schrooten, 1996] </ref>. The idea of a mediation agent has been studied in an experiment on cooperative administration on environmental matters 4 . In this experiment complex administrative procedures have been supported by administration agents. <p> Control tasks and document interaction tasks should be separated. 3. There is currently no notion of traveling agents. An agent resides on a one server, and it does not move to others. A variety of these issues have since been attacked. For example, <ref> [Schrooten, 1996] </ref> elaborates on the notions of locations and personal agents, while in [Geldof, 1996] the generation of documents from a high level page description language is being investigated.

Reference-contexts: These issue-based information systems would feed back into the collective memory of the community, becoming part of its hyperspace. The idea of applying hypermedia to negotiation problems is not new (see e.g., <ref> [Schuler, 1988] </ref>). Two features highlight the GEOMED appraoch. First, we advocate an explicit representation of the mediation process.

First our notion of personal agent corresponds to an electronic representative of a particular interest of a person or group involved in a planning or decision process. Second, the GEOMED mediation agents are the operational documentation of the mediation processes.
