Abstract: References [1, 5] introduce a transport protocol that offers partially ordered service for multimedia applications. This paper investigates how much the selection of a linear extension affects system performance in a partially ordered service. We first show how to identify better linear extensions of a partial order, and then determine the performance gains by using such linear extensions at the time of transmission. To quantify linear extensions of a partial order, we propose a new metric (pBuf -metric) that is derived from buffering probabilities. Since pBuf -metric is complex to calculate, a simplified version called ff-metric is also investigated. An OPNET simulation shows that for certain partial orders, a linear extension optimized according to these metrics provides some delay, and significant buffer utilization improvements over a non-optimal linear extension. Thus, prudent transmission order selection in a partially ordered service does improve system performance. Results also show that, in general, ff-metric is as effective as pBuf -metric in identifying better linear extensions of a partial order.

At a network layer delay of 4, the sender buffer size will be about half the pipesize.

Reference-contexts: Since partially ordered service does not insist on delivering all objects in sequence, it can provide lower delays and buffer utilization than ordered service, while, at the same time, guaranteeing a multimedia application's partial order requirements. Analytic results from <ref> [8] </ref> show that, under particular network conditions, a partially ordered service provides delay, buffer utilization, and buffering time improvements over an ordered service. <p> This is clearly impractical. Thus, we first investigate how to identify near-optimal linear extensions in a practical way. For this, we propose a new metric (pBuf -metric) as a means of quantifying a linear extension's goodness. This metric is based on buffering probabilities and is derived from analytic results <ref> [8] </ref>. Since pBuf -metric has a complex expression, we also propose another metric (ff-metric) which is a simplified version of pBuf -metric and easier to compute. <p> Results from <ref> [8] </ref> show that the choice of which linear extension (LE) is used by the sender can have significant impact on expected performance. In general, as the distance between dependent objects increases, expected performance improves. <p> Partially reliable transport service provides a middle ground between these two in which the loss tolerance of each object can be specified individually. References [1, 3, 4] consider partial order and partial reliability in juxtaposition, while <ref> [8] </ref> and this paper focus solely on partial order. 4 explained as follows: given objects a and b such that a b in partial order P O, by increasing the separation of a from b, the expected time that b will be buffered due to the network's loss of a will <p> Thus, these predictors will be extremely useful by the transport sender in selecting a better transmission order. Both of these metrics are based on buffering probabilities and derived from analytic results <ref> [8] </ref>. Through these metrics, we hope to identify the LE of a P O that results in improved, if not optimal, system performance. These metrics consider the effects of different system parameters (e.g., loss rate, buffer sizes) while quantifying 5 the goodness of a linear extension as a transmission order. <p> Let pBuf a (P O; LE) be the buffering probability for object a. Then, pBuf a (P O; LE) can be approximated as follows <ref> [8] </ref>: pBuf a (P O; LE) ' X pBuf i;a (LE) (1) where pBuf i;a (LE) is the probability that object i is received after object a. <p> LE) N The pBuf -metric approximates the average of the buffering probabilities when b Dist a;b (LE), the distance between objects a and b in linear extension LE, is defined as "seq (b)- seq (a)" where seq (x) returns the assigned sequence number for object x in linear extension LE <ref> [8] </ref>. 6 the linear extension LE of P O is used as transmission order. Because of this char-acteristic of pBuf -metric, it can be used to discover the LE (or the set of LEs) of a P O that achieves low buffering probabilities in the system. <p> ffmetric (P O; LE) = 1 fl ab in P O ff Dist a;b (LE) (5) where 0 ff 0:5. ff-metric is derived from pBuf -metric as follows: When Buf S = 2, expression (3) reduces to pBuf a;b (LE) = 1 1+p fl pfl (1q) Dist a;b (LE) (see <ref> [8] </ref> for computational details). Let ff = pfl (1q) 1+pfl (1q) . Notice that since the network loss rate will always be between 0 and 1, 0 ff 0:5. <p> In the simulation study of Section 4, we determine how effective ff-metric is in finding good linear extensions of a partial order. We will carry out this study by comparing the performance of ff-Best LE with that of pBuf -Best LE. 4 Simulation Study From analytic study <ref> [8] </ref>, we expect under certain circumstances, using partially ordered service over ordered service can provide valuable performance improvements. Additionally, under these circumstances, using an optimal LE as the transmission order can maximize the expected improvements. <p> To quantify linear extensions, we propose a new metric (pBuf -metric) that is based on buffering probabilities and derived from analytic results <ref> [8] </ref>. Since pBuf - metric has a complex expression, we propose a simplified version of it, called ff-metric, as an alternative metric.

Reference-contexts: The proof of this theorem can be found in <ref> [9] </ref>. In general, the more linear extensions a partial order has, the more difficult it is to find pBuf -Best LE of that P O. The number of linear extensions of a P O increases, in general, exponentially with the size of P O. <p> Figures 3 and 4 present all of the chain-singleton and parallel-streams P Os used in the simulation experiments. Each P O is characterized by its m (P O) value and density (denoted as "Dens (PO)" in the figures). Density and m (P O) are two met-rics previously proposed <ref> [1, 9] </ref> as complexity measures of different partially ordered services. Let e (P O) be the number of linear extensions of P O. m (P O) is then defined [1] as log e (P O) log N! . <p> Similarly, a P O with larger m (P O) value can be expected to result in better performance than the one with lower m (P O) value. Reference <ref> [9] </ref> shows that these two metrics are almost equally effective in quantifying partially ordered services. Thus, in the simulation study of Section 4.3, we investigate the performance improvements using optimal LEs of P Os with different densities. 1. <p> Multimedia applications that contain independent 10 streams in parallel can be represented by this class of partial orders. In addition to chain-singleton and parallel-streams P Os, reference <ref> [9] </ref> introduces two more classes of partial orders that are motivated by multimedia applications: (1) chain-of-antichain and (2) antichain-chain P Os. It turns out that all LEs of a chain-of-antichain or antichain-chain partial order result in identical system performance. <p> The simulation model was verified by (i) detailed code-inspection and debugging, (ii) comparing the results against those of the analytic model (whenever possible), and (iii) designing a set of 22 experiments, hypothesizing their expected results, running the experiments, and verifying the results as expected <ref> [9] </ref>. In the simulation model's verification phase, results for , R Buff , and T end were generally within 1% of the analytic model results when each experiment was repeated three times with 30; 000 objects. <p> and receiver are generally used, we can conclude that for most practical purposes, one can use ff-metric instead of the complex pBuf -metric in evaluating LEs. 5 Summary and Future Work Previous work demonstrates that under certain network conditions, a partially ordered service provides better performance than an ordered service <ref> [9] </ref>. Given a partially ordered service, this paper investigates whether or not the careful selection of a linear extension can further improve system performance, and if so, how much the performance is improved.
