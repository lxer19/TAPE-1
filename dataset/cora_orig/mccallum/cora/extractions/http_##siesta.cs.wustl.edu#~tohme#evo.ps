Title: A Mathematical Representation of Economical Evolution  
Author: Fernando Tohmey Silvia London 
Address: del Sur, Argentina  
Affiliation: Departamento de Economa, Universidad Nacional  yWashington University in St.Louis, Department of Computer Science  
Abstract: This paper analyzes a possible formalization of economic evolution, by means of discrete dynamical systems. An evolutionary process is seen as a sequence of states of the structural parameters of the economy. Environmental pressures or internal conflicts may force structural changes. The source of changes can be found in the conflicts among structures, which can be traced back to conflicts between the agents' models of the economy and the actual structures. As usual in evolutionary processes, there exist a variety of possibilities, but, as changes respond to unfulfilled requirements, an ordering can be defined on trajectories. The maximal ones will be called progress-efficient.

In turn, an trajectory in OP 0 determines a path in the fi fi X fi fi R for the economy *.

Reference-contexts: Any particular state of the economy is, therefore, only a metaestable state of a complex evolutionary process. The whole system can be called self-organized because, given an external "shock" it goes from a metastable state to another one due to its internal dynamics <ref> [Haken 88] </ref>. This dynamics is in itself a system of rules that can be modified, through a higher level of rules, leading to a potential infinite regress: rules for changing rules for changing rules...etc.

Reference-contexts: Finally in section 5 we briefly discuss the conclusions to this work. 2 Representation of an Economy It is commonplace to represent an economy, in abstract terms, as a game-form. The idea underlying this approach is straightforward: an economy is constituted fixed for every run. 2 See <ref> [Hodgson 93, Nelson 95] </ref> for recent surveys of the history and current literature of the field. 3 by self-interested agents in interaction and game theory is the best analytical tool available for that kind of situations.

Reference-contexts: The idea is that given a social choice function, an economy, in order to provide as an outcome the social choice, should be represented as a game in which it is supported by (hopefully) an unique Nash equilibrium <ref> [Moore 92] </ref>. This approach is both very interesting and very powerful, but we feel that it fails to address certain relevant aspects in the description of an economy. Interactions among agents are only a part of the whole characterization of an economy.

Reference-contexts: Even so, it has several lines of research to be continued. One possibility is to give more specific characterization of economies, in order to simulate evolutionary processes. We are currently examining the possibility of doing this, using methods taken from the increasingly important field of Artificial Life <ref> [SFI 97] </ref>, and we hope to get useful insights from these experiments.

Reference-contexts: This characterization is abstract, but reflects clearly the following properties: * Agents are bounded rational. Their choices are based on the model they have of the economy <ref> [Sargent 93] </ref>. * The productive structure produces their own inputs. * The socio-political structure represents the institutional setting of the economy.
