Title: Statistical Multiplexing of Multiple Time-Scale Markov Streams 1  
Author: David N.C. Tse Robert G. Gallager and John N. Tsitsiklis 
Abstract: We study the problem of statistical multiplexing of cell streams which have correlations at multiple time-scales. Each stream is modeled by a singularly perturbed Markov-modulated process with some state transitions occurring much more infrequently than others. One motivation of this model comes from variable-rate compressed video, where the fast time-scale dynamics may correspond to correlations between adjacent frames while the slow time-scale dynamics may correspond to correlations within the same scene of a video sequence. Another motivation is to use the model to study situations when dynamics of different traffic streams occur at different time-scales. We develop a set of large deviations results to estimate the buffer overflow probabilities in various asymptotic regimes in the buffer size, rare transition probabilities and the number of streams. Using these results, we characterize the multiplexing gain in both the channel capacity and the buffering requirements, and highlight the impact of the slow time-scale of the streams. It is also shown that while a recently proposed effective bandwidth concept generalizes naturally to multiple time-scale streams in some parameter regimes, in regimes where there are many statistically simliar sources, it becomes overly conservative and has to be replaced by better estimates.

Reference-contexts: Thus, for small ff &gt; 0, the source would typically spend a long time in a sub-chain, and then occasionally jump to a different sub-chain through a transition in R. This multiple time-scale model is similar to the singular-perturbed or *-decomposable Markov models (see for example <ref> [Cou77] </ref>), although here there is no restriction that the rare transition probabilities must be integral powers of ff. We introduce the asymptotic structure on the rare transition probabilities to model the fact that the process remains in each sub-chain for a long time before switching to another sub-chain.

Reference-contexts: By the Perron-Frobenius theorem, the matrix A (r) has a largest positive simple eigenvalue (r) (the spectral radius of A (r)) with a strictly positive right eigenvector r , unique up to scaling: A (r) r = (r) r (2.1) It can be shown (see for example <ref> [DZ92] </ref>) that the log spectral radius function fl (r) log (r) is convex and differentiable for all r 2 &lt;, and that fl (0) = 0 and fl 0 (0) = E (X 1 ). <p> The main result we need from large deviations theory is the Gartner-Ellis Theorem. Here is a special case which suffices for our purposes. For a proof of the general result, see <ref> [DZ92] </ref>. 8 This assumption is not necessary, and in general all our asymptotic results can instead be expressed in terms of the limiting conditional probabilities (as ff ! 0). <p> It can be shown that in this case, the asymptotic log moment generating function is in fact equal to the log spectral radius function <ref> [DZ92] </ref>: lim 1 log E [exp (r t=1 where (r) is the spectral radius function for the process fX t g. The following is the first major result of the section.

Reference-contexts: Because these networks will carry traffic from very different classes of services, this is expected to be a common phenomenon. Third, traffic management based on a separation between cell level and burst level congestion has been proposed for ATM networks (see <ref> [JR92] </ref>). This approach can be viewed as a specific example of a multiple time-scale decomposition of the traffic process, and our general results here provides a better understanding of when such a separation is valid. Recently, the single-link statistical multiplexing problem has received a lot of attention.

Reference-contexts: Here, we will use martingale techniques to shed some insight on this issue. Let us first consider the simplest case where the time-slotted arrival stream fX t g is an i.i.d. process. Using a reasonably standard reduction by means of renewal theory (see for example <ref> [PW89] </ref>), the cell loss probability in this case can be well approximated by the probability that, starting from an empty buffer, the buffer becomes full before emptying it out again.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the above result implies a clean separation of time-scales in the typical way of overflowing the buffer. Such separation of time-scale phenomenon needs not hold in all large deviations rare events associated with multiple time-scale processes. See <ref> [Tse94] </ref> for an example in which there is a tight coupling between the slow and fast time-scale dynamics in the typical way leading to the rare event.
