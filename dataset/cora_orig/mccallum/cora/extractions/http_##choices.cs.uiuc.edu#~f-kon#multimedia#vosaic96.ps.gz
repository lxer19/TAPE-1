Abstract: Systems for the real-time transmission of video and audio on low-bandwidth lines must account for the limited bandwidth available, the bandwidth variance, packet loss rates, as well as CPU load. Vosaic, short for Video Mosaic, integrates real-time continuous media within standard Web pages, and handles the issues of transmitting continuous media with the Video Datagram Protocol (VDP). VDP dynamically adapts the media stream to the available network and CPU bandwidth, thus improving video performance. Built as an object-oriented framework, Vosaic permits the easy addition and customization of the basic VDP protocol for different media types. This family of protocols currently support two different standard video formats, as well as four audio formats.

Reference-contexts: We reimplemented the core modules in Vosaic in an object-oriented manner using lessons learnt in the building of the Choices and Choices <ref> [1, 2] </ref> object-oriented operating systems. The object-oriented framework permits the easy addition and the incremental customization of protocols and decoders. We expanded the number of video and audio formats we support.

Reference-contexts: These systems concentrated on transmitting high quality, and consequently high bandwidth, video and audio over the Internet, or over specialized high bandwidth networks. Even later multimedia tools, such as the "low-bandwidth" NV and VAT for the MBONE <ref> [3, 7] </ref>, required at least ISDN rates for proper functioning. Providers of real-time video and audio have only recently appeared in commercial form on the Internet.

Reference-contexts: Systems such as Cen, Pu, Staehli, Cowan and Walpole's Distributed MPEG Player <ref> [4] </ref> adapt when the display frame rate falls below some level. In contrast, we perform adaptation at the tail of the buffer queue instead of measuring display rate. This allows us to respond to changing conditions before these effects propagate to the head of the queue.

Reference-contexts: Audio is never dropped. Dropping audio would cause undesirable glitches in the playback of the media stream. In contrast, human visual perception does not find a decrease in playback frame rate excessively annoying. 4.2 Smoothing and Loss As described in <ref> [5] </ref>, VDP maintains a buffer of size fi RTT, where RT T is the round trip time between the server and the client, and 1. The buffer smoothes network jitter and allows the retransmission of key frames which are lost. Packets are time stamped and have sequence numbers.

Reference-contexts: The browser we built incorporates real time video and audio into standard hypertext pages and which are displayed in place. Video and audio transfers occur in real time; there is no file retrieval latency. The video and audio result in compelling Web pages. However, we recognized that TCP <ref> [10] </ref> is unsuitable for transmitting real-time audio and video. The reasons are: * TCP imposes its own flow control and windowing schemes on the data stream. These mechanisms effectively destroy the temporal relations shared between video frames and audio packets.

Reference-contexts: The system also permits random access and easy reuse of all or parts of any movie and sound segment. A popular approach to video over POTS lines is the use of proprietary video compression algorithms, eg., wavelets <ref> [11] </ref>. These algorithms are competitive with Fourier transforms and may provide very high 1 compression ratios. In contrast, we developed our system to transmit the most widely available compres-sion formats. For example, we implement support for the standard compression formats MPEG [6] and H.263 [13].
