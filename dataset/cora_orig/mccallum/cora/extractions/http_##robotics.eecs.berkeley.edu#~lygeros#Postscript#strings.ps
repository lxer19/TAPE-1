Abstract: Motivated by our work on Automated Highway Systems (AHS), we consider a physical system, the string of vehicles and construct a natural model for it in the Hybrid Input/Output Automaton formalism. We describe a special maneuver that may have to be executed by the system, the emergency deceleration maneuver, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the system parameters under which this maneuver can be executed in safety. We conclude by giving a brief discussion of the implications of our results for the design of an AHS that allows the formation of platoons of vehicles.

Reference-contexts: We try to establish conditions under which a string of vehicles will be safe while executing a particular maneuver. We start by developing a detailed model for the system in the Hybrid In- put/Output Automaton modeling framework (Section 2). Modest extensions of the original framework of <ref> [1] </ref> are needed to capture all the phenomena of interest for this problem. Then, in Section 3 we introduce the emergency deceleration ?

Variables are typed; for each v 2 V A let type (v) denote the type of v. <p> A set D A V A fi A fi V A of discrete transitions. A set W A of trajectories over V A . Some technical axioms are imposed on the above sets to guarantee that the definitions are consistent. The axioms introduced in <ref> [1] </ref> are too restrictive for the application considered here; fortunately the extensions needed are fairly straightforward. <p> To ensure that the model is realistic we impose the following assumption: Assumption 2 For all i, M i &gt; 0 and ff i (v) 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for all v &gt; 0. Note that in general vehicles may end up going backwards as a result of collisions if, for example, a light vehicle elastically hits a slowly moving heavy vehicle (i.e. M i t M i1 , ff i 1 and v i1 0). <p> P 1 (x 1 ; v 0 ; v 1 ) = P 1 (0; v 0 ; v 1 ) 0. Hence, by the restitution equation (3), (v 0 0 v 0 1 (v 0 v 1 ) 2 v 2 ff 1 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> by Assumption 2. Therefore, P 1 (x 0 1 ; v 0 1 ) = P 1 (0; v 0 1 ) 0 and (P 1 0) _ (v 1 0) is again true after Collision 1 .

Reference-contexts: The last property shows that vehicles are declared as touching by the model only when they are physically touching. We are interested in defining the system performance in terms of the severity of the collisions experienced by the vehicles. Following <ref> [2] </ref>, we assume that a collision is safe if the relative velocity at impact is below a certain threshold, v A . A commonly cited threshold is v A = 3ms 1 [2]. Definition 1 A string is safe if V N1 variant property. <p> Following <ref> [2] </ref>, we assume that a collision is safe if the relative velocity at impact is below a certain threshold, v A . A commonly cited threshold is v A = 3ms 1 [2]. Definition 1 A string is safe if V N1 variant property. The main limitation of our model is that is does not account for the lateral motion of the vehicles. We assume that all vehicles effectively move along a straight line.

We are also trying to investigate the effect of different deceleration strategies.

A platoon is a string of very tightly spaced vehicles. Typically intra-platoon spacings are of the order of 1-2 meters. The safety of the intra-platoon controllers <ref> [6] </ref> relies on the assumption that the behavior of the first vehicle is in some sense "reasonable". This means that the controller C 0 takes into account the limitations of the rest of the vehicles in the string when calculating u 0 . <p> Note also that the calculation saturates after the first few vehicles; a similar observation was made in <ref> [6] </ref> about the increase in deceleration effort required along a platoon for "string stability". Overall, The above calculations indicate that the safety of the platooning system under emergency braking can only be guaranteed under rather limited conditions, in particular for small platoons consisting of vehicles of similar deceleration capabilities.

Reference-contexts: This requirement is clearly violated in the case of the emergency deceleration maneuver. It is conjectured however that the platoon is going to be safe even in this case <ref> [8] </ref>. The justification is that collisions are going to take place in rapid succession, because the vehicles are all close to one another. Therefore, if the speeds of all vehicles are initially the same, the relative velocity at the time of collision is going to be small.

Reference-contexts: Overall, The above calculations indicate that the safety of the platooning system under emergency braking can only be guaranteed under rather limited conditions, in particular for small platoons consisting of vehicles of similar deceleration capabilities. This observation is in agreement with the numerical study of <ref> [9] </ref>. One can improve the situation by modifying the system parameters, by arranging the vehicles in a platoon in a particular order (e.g. in the order of increasing deceleration capability) and by designing better deceleration controllers.
