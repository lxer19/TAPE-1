Reference-contexts: We have determined by experimentation that the sampling error of the laser rangefinder is Gaussian distributed and that a linear relationship exists between the average sampling error (average of the absolute values) and the object distance <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> . In most experiments conducted for this research, data acquisition was performed with the rangefinder at a distance of around 40 centimeters from the object, sometimes more depending on the size and shape of the object. <p> The other parameters affecting search performance are related to the evaluation of the cost function. These were determined experimentally as follows (see Section 3.2 and <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> ): (i) control point sample interval (=5) (ii) overlap factor (=30%) (iii) distance threshold (=5 millimeters) The experiments were done with different objects in order to obtain a representative idea of parameter sensitivity. The second set of parameters controls the VFSR algorithm. <p> However, the ones cited are the primary parameters for controlling the annealing process. It was determined through extensive and well controlled experiments that setting T 0 , T RS and T AS to 1.0, 0.001 and 10000, respectively, yielded excellent registration results <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> . Search convergence using these parameters was relatively insensitive to the type of range views being registered . The experiments were performed for two very different objects (the owl and metal pipe) and the same settings were found to be optimum in both cases. fl Dr.

Reference-contexts: There are other methods which are partially related to the registration problem. For example, the one proposed by Shah and Jain [ 12 ] solved the correspondence problem in 2D by matching corners across image frames. Chen <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> has devised a technique for determining the pose of an object in a scene based on a known model. The sensory data were lines and the reference model was in the form of planes.

Reference-contexts: The disadvantage of this approach is the excessive amount of computing time. The approaches presented above all compare surface information between views in order to 8 register them. Other methods make use of features extracted from the range surfaces to guide the registration. For example, Cheng and Don <ref> [ 3 ] </ref> invoked the principle of invariance of distance measures under rigid body motion. They chose a triangle of points 4P 1 P 2 P 3 from the first view and then found the best matching triangle in the other.

Reference-contexts: Correspondence across views was established by a ray-casting procedure. The matching algorithm minimized these differences over all of the control points, thereby maximizing shape similarity. Cheng and Medioni <ref> [ 4 ] </ref> employed an iterative method to register two range images. An initial estimate of the transformation was assumed to be available. Range views were registered by minimizing the distance from control points in one view to planes in the other. <p> The distance measure was defined as the Euclidean distance between the control point in view 1 and the corresponding tangent plane in view 2. Our method is similar to that of Cheng and Medioni's <ref> [ 4 ] </ref> . The main difference is their use of a line-surface intersection search algorithm to determine point correspondence between range views. In our approach, correspondence is established directly through an inverse calibration function. <p> The method discussed in this paper has the advantages of the surface matching algorithms of Potmesil [ 6 ] or Cheng and Medioni <ref> [ 4 ] </ref> , in the sense that no feature extraction step is necessary. However, the point correspondence problem required by these techniques is eliminated by using inverse camera equations to directly compute the position of corresponding points across range views. 3.

Reference-contexts: A conventional gradient descent approach would be inadequate. Thus Very Fast Simulated Annealing (VFSR), a stochastic optimization method, was used to minimize the cost function <ref> [ 5 ] </ref> . Section 4.2 discusses the search parameters used for VFSR and the values of these parameters yielding optimum performance for registration. Section 4.3 presents various dual-view registration experiments. Each consists of the registration of two range views obtained by sampling an object from two different viewing positions. <p> Lester Ingber fl and was adapted to the registration task discussed in this paper <ref> [ 5 ] </ref> . In this computer program, more parameters are provided to control search than the ones actually mentioned above. However, the ones cited are the primary parameters for controlling the annealing process.

Reference-contexts: This comparison is performed over the entire surface or over a set of control points on the surface. The second consists of methods which register range views by matching features from one view with those from the other. The approach taken by Potmesil <ref> [ 6 ] </ref> is to compare surface differences between range views and to find the rigid 3D transformation which minimizes those differences. The different views of the object were acquired so as to guarantee partial overlap. <p> A line-surface intersection algorithm was used to determine the point in the second view which was intersected by a line originating from a control point in the first view and in the direction of the normal at that point. This is similar to the way Potmesil <ref> [ 6 ] </ref> established correspondences across range views. Once the intersection point was found, the equation of the plane, tangent to the surface at that point, was determined. <p> Finally, the reader might wish to consult Sabata and Aggarwal [ 9 ] for a review of the problem of estimating motion from a pair of range images. The method discussed in this paper has the advantages of the surface matching algorithms of Potmesil <ref> [ 6 ] </ref> or Cheng and Medioni [ 4 ] , in the sense that no feature extraction step is necessary. However, the point correspondence problem required by these techniques is eliminated by using inverse camera equations to directly compute the position of corresponding points across range views. 3.

Reference-contexts: A pattern was drawn on the base plane which permitted the inter-frame transformation to be deduced by observing the orientation of this pattern in the intensity image. Similar to Sakaguchi et al., Potmesil <ref> [ 7 ] </ref> has used an octree representation for creating 3D models from intensity images. But instead of combining range views, conic volumes, generated from silhouettes of the object, were merged.

Reference-contexts: Srivasta and Ahuja [ 14 ] have employed a similar method and tested their algorithm with artificial 3D data, for which they could directly derive the views from any desired position. Again employing artificial data, Roth-Tabak and Jain <ref> [ 8 ] </ref> simulated a system in which a sensor was moved around its environment in order to build an internal representation of its surrounding world.

Reference-contexts: So here again features are matched in order to determine a motion transformation. However, the problem with these techniques is that they rely on accurate feature extraction prior to registration and this process is very prone to error. Finally, the reader might wish to consult Sabata and Aggarwal <ref> [ 9 ] </ref> for a review of the problem of estimating motion from a pair of range images.

Reference-contexts: These methods are presented in Section 2.2. 2.1 Open Loop Registration Techniques As indicated above, many researchers have circumvented the problem of searching for the appropriate motion transformation to register two range images by simply relying on accurate and precise hardware. For example, Sakaguchi et al. <ref> [ 10, 11 ] </ref> have utilized this technique to generate octree models of 3D objects. Both a precision turntable and an eye-in-hand system were used for data acquisition. The authors do not discuss how the registration of views obtained with the movable eye-in-hand system were performed.

Reference-contexts: The method would only work well with very smooth and regular surfaces. This is not the case for the majority of objects in the world, most of which contain edges and many of which have textured surfaces. The registration method described by Soucy <ref> [ 13 ] </ref> compares surface structures across range views to determine the best registration transformation. The latter may be nonrigid, meaning that the surfaces are allowed to deform in order to be properly registered. <p> Each of the selected patches was then fit to the surface of the second view. The basis of Soucy's approach is the minimization of a functional that measures the difference between a local neighborhood in one image and a corresponding one in an adjacent image <ref> [ 13 ] </ref> . Soucy demonstrated qualitatively that the functional became convex after a sufficient number of iterations of the curvature consistency algorithm. Then, assuming unimodality of the functional, a simple gradient descent algorithm was used to find the best motion parameters for each patch.

Reference-contexts: But instead of combining range views, conic volumes, generated from silhouettes of the object, were merged. To merge the different conic volumes, Potmesil used a camera calibration technique to find the position of the sensor with respect to a fixed frame of reference. Srivasta and Ahuja <ref> [ 14 ] </ref> have employed a similar method and tested their algorithm with artificial 3D data, for which they could directly derive the views from any desired position.

Reference-contexts: This results in an extremely fast metric for the evaluation of inter-surface distance. This metric is then the basis for a cost 7 function which is optimized in order to register range views. Szeliski <ref> [ 15 ] </ref> has proposed a registration method which does not require a transformation estimate or knowledge of correspondences between the two views. A motion estimate is obtained by finding the geometric transformation which makes it most likely (in a Bayesian sense) that the points come from the same surface.

Reference-contexts: However, similar to the views acquired with the turntable, it is very likely that they employed the positional estimate of the robot arm in order to determine the transformation between range views. Vemuri and Aggarwal <ref> [ 16 ] </ref> also relied on a calibrated system to obtain inter-frame transformations. They made use of a turntable (base plane) on which the object to be modeled was placed.

Reference-contexts: Future improvements of the algorithm could involve the following: 1. The data acquisition process could be automated by computing the next viewing position directly from the range data according to some attentional criterion (see Whaite <ref> [ 17, 18 ] </ref> ). 2. Instead of the normal annealing schedule of VFSR, a better termination condition should be found for the registration.
