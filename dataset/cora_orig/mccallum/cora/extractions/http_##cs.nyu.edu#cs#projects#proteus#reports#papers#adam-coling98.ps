Abstract: This paper describes how NOMLEX, a dictionary of nominalizations, can be used in Information Extraction (IE). This paper details a procedure which maps syntactic and semantic information designed for writing an IE pattern for an active clause (IBM appointed Alice Smith as vice president) into a set of patterns for nominaliza-tions (e.g., IBM's appointment of Alice Smith as vice president and Alice Smith's appointment as vice president).

Reference-contexts: For further discussion, see Section 5. this information, one can compare the situation with that of English verbal complements, which have been extensively studied and recorded. In English, verbal complements are relatively fixed in composition and order. As a result, the common practice (adopted, for example, in OALD <ref> (Hornby, 1980) </ref>, LDOCE (Proctor, 1978), and COMLEX Syntax (Macleod et al., forthcoming) is to enumerate and name the possible subcat-egorizations, where in general each subcategorization represents a fixed sequence of syntactic elements. 4 For example, in COMLEX (Wolff et al., 1994), NP-PP consists of a Noun Phrase followed by a Prepositional
