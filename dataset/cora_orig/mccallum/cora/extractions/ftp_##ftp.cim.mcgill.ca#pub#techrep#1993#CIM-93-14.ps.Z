Abstract: A key problem in the recovery of scene descriptions from multiple views is the fusion of information from different vantage points. The contribution of this paper is a set of algorithms for reconstructing surfaces obtained from overlapping range images in a common frame of reference. Surfaces are assumed to be piecewise-smooth but not necessarily rigid. Motion parameters, rotations and translations that describe correspondence between views, are recovered locally under the assumption that the curvature structure at a point on a surface varies slowly under transformation. The recovery problem can thus be posed as finding the set of motion parameters that preserves curvature across two views. We show that an appropriate similarity functional can be devised that is convex in the vicinity of the true motion parameters. This leads to an efficient local algorithm that recovers motion parameters in gradient descent fashion. Fusion of information from different viewpoints is accomplished by applying local motion estimates to map data points between frames. However, because these estimates are determined locally, they are subject to the usual effects of noise and quantization error. To increase the robustness of this reconstruction procedure the additional constraint of motion consistency is introduced, that variations in the velocities of adjacent regions are also piecewise-smooth. This is cast as a second local minimization problem which seeks to find the set of motion parameters that minimizes differences in the relative positions and orientations at adjacent points. The resulting algorithm serves to smooth out local perturbations and blend adjacent surface patches. In contrast to global rigid body motion approaches, our procedure for reconstructing surfaces from different viewpoints is tolerant of local errors in correspondence and can accommodate objects that are articulated.

Reference-contexts: The problem of recovering orientation and curvature has been investigated by a number of authors. A common approach is to locally approximate S and estimate the components of D (x) from the parameters of the approximation <ref> [3, 10, 20, 22] </ref>. Various techniques can be used to optimize estimation in the presence of noise, but they largely fall short when it comes to estimating directions [38]. <p> This is done by fitting a quadric patch to the neighbourhood of each discrete sample point and then computing the components of D (x) and D (x 0 ) from the quadric parameters. The approach is essentially that described by <ref> [3] </ref>. 2. The curvature consistency algorithm [38, 18] is then applied to these initial estimates. The algorithm is implemented as an iterative filter which can be explained with the aid of Figure 10. Two frames are shown, D P at point P and D Q at a neighbouring point Q.

Reference-contexts: This result is not surprising considering that motion estimates are based on regions with limited support. Clearly some further interpretation is required. One approach would be to apply a second stage of reconstruction to the composite surface in order to smooth out perturbations due to errors in motion parameters <ref> [4, 21] </ref>. The problem 1 This is done for computational expediency. 3 The same surface after first applying the motion consistency algorithm to the local motion estimates. here is that such errors tend to introduce structural changes which are difficult to separate out, e.g. the introduction of surface discontinuities.

Reference-contexts: These are respectively the rotation matrix and translation vector which map x to x 0 . In particular we show that by exploiting some well-known forms from differential geometry <ref> [9] </ref>, a D T can be devised that is convex in the vicinity of the true motion parameters. This leads to an efficient local algorithm that recovers motion parameters and T in gradient descent fashion. <p> The requirement of determining local motion parameters further suggests that this flow should be expressed in terms of the differential structure of the surface. A convenient representation in this regard is what Sander [38] refers to as an augmented Darboux frame <ref> [9] </ref>. To each point x 2 I (i; j; t) an augmented Darboux frame, D (x), is associated which describes the orientation and curvature of the local neighbourhood of x. <p> (x) and D (x 0 ): - D (x) and D (x 0 ) are constrained to lie on S and S 0 respectively, limiting the space of motion parameters that must be searched. - D (x) and D (x 0 ) are continuous functions of S and S 0 <ref> [9] </ref>. 7 Initial estimates of and T, ^ and ^ T, can often be determined through operational constraints, e.g. motion parameters provided by the manipulator system used to position the sensor, or specific knowledge about how the sensor or object can move in relation to each other. <p> In effect D P ff is an extrapolation of the surface at Q to P according to the transport model defined by S. Formally, this mechanism is referred to as parallel transport <ref> [9] </ref>. We use this transport model to enforce the constraint of locally constant curvature [34].

Reference-contexts: However, this approach does not work because surface recovery is confounded by motion, i.e. the motion parameters that produce the smoothest surface in terms of temporal curvature variation do not necessarily produce the correct one. Thus our strategy is instead to first apply the curvature consistency algorithm <ref> [38, 18] </ref> independently to I (t) and I (t + 1) to obtain stable surface representations. <p> With successive iterations, however, the minimum becomes increasingly more distinct and better localized to the point where a simple gradient descent approach suffices. We will not go into the details of the curvature consistency algorithm here, but will summarize the basic ideas for completeness. The reader is referred to <ref> [38, 21, 18] </ref> for specific details. The overall procedure consists of two stages: 12 1 iteration (c) 3 iterations (d) 5 iterations. 1. Initial estimates of D (x) and D (x 0 ) are computed for each x and x 0 respectively. <p> This is done by fitting a quadric patch to the neighbourhood of each discrete sample point and then computing the components of D (x) and D (x 0 ) from the quadric parameters. The approach is essentially that described by [3]. 2. The curvature consistency algorithm <ref> [38, 18] </ref> is then applied to these initial estimates. The algorithm is implemented as an iterative filter which can be explained with the aid of Figure 10. Two frames are shown, D P at point P and D Q at a neighbouring point Q.

Reference-contexts: Selection is made on the basis of the attributes associated with the frame D (x) corresponding to each point. For example, frames corresponding to local maxima and minima of curvature are good candidates for matching because they are easy to localize <ref> [19] </ref>. On the other hand, frames associated with low magnitudes of M and M or umbilic points where M = M are bad candidates as the surface has few distinguishing characteristics within their vicinity.

Reference-contexts: This filter is obtained by minimizing a functional form that represents local differences in D (x) under the assumption of locally constant curvature. The principle is often referred to as curvature consistency <ref> [34] </ref>. With estimates of D (x) 8x 2 I (i; j; t) and D (x 0 ) 8x 0 2 I (i; j; t + 1) computed, a similar minimization strategy can be applied to solve for the local motion parameters. <p> In effect D P ff is an extrapolation of the surface at Q to P according to the transport model defined by S. Formally, this mechanism is referred to as parallel transport [9]. We use this transport model to enforce the constraint of locally constant curvature <ref> [34] </ref>. <p> In curvature consistency the frames D i (x) and D i (x 0 ) were iteratively filtered such that curvature variation was minimized according to the assumption of locally constant curvature <ref> [34, 38, 21] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The requirement of determining local motion parameters further suggests that this flow should be expressed in terms of the differential structure of the surface. A convenient representation in this regard is what Sander <ref> [38] </ref> refers to as an augmented Darboux frame [9]. To each point x 2 I (i; j; t) an augmented Darboux frame, D (x), is associated which describes the orientation and curvature of the local neighbourhood of x. <p> However, correctly and efficiently recovering local motion parameters also depends on being able to accurately recover D (x). Such methods have been investigated in <ref> [38, 21, 14, 16, 17, 15, 26] </ref>, and form the basis of our current work. Briefly, the idea is to first use local approximation techniques to build initial estimates of D (x). <p> However, this approach does not work because surface recovery is confounded by motion, i.e. the motion parameters that produce the smoothest surface in terms of temporal curvature variation do not necessarily produce the correct one. Thus our strategy is instead to first apply the curvature consistency algorithm <ref> [38, 18] </ref> independently to I (t) and I (t + 1) to obtain stable surface representations. <p> In curvature consistency the augmented Darboux frame serves as a basis for comparison between two local neighbourhoods and provides the analytical form on which an appropriate minimization functional is devised <ref> [38, 21] </ref>. Motion consistency relies on a similar analog to represent motion parameters, namely the rotation matrix . By expressing rotations as their equivalent quaternions [40, 39], and following a similar line of analysis, one obtains a set of updating functions that forms the basis of an iterative filter. <p> This analysis is quite complex because of the forms involved, particularly those involving mappings from local tangent plane coordinates to the embedding frame of h (u; v). For a discussion of this analysis in the context of surface interpolation, see <ref> [38] </ref>. Instead, our approach is to investigate the behaviour of (7) by means of numerical simulation. <p> A common approach is to locally approximate S and estimate the components of D (x) from the parameters of the approximation [3, 10, 20, 22]. Various techniques can be used to optimize estimation in the presence of noise, but they largely fall short when it comes to estimating directions <ref> [38] </ref>. For this reason we apply the curvature consistency algorithm [38, 21] to precisely recover D (x) and D (x 0 ) for each discrete sample in I (i; j; t) and I (i; j; t + 1) respectively. <p> Various techniques can be used to optimize estimation in the presence of noise, but they largely fall short when it comes to estimating directions [38].

We will not go into the details of the curvature consistency algorithm here, but will summarize the basic ideas for completeness. The reader is referred to <ref> [38, 21, 18] </ref> for specific details. The overall procedure consists of two stages: 12 1 iteration (c) 3 iterations (d) 5 iterations. 1. Initial estimates of D (x) and D (x 0 ) are computed for each x and x 0 respectively. <p> This is done by fitting a quadric patch to the neighbourhood of each discrete sample point and then computing the components of D (x) and D (x 0 ) from the quadric parameters. The approach is essentially that described by [3]. 2. The curvature consistency algorithm <ref> [38, 18] </ref> is then applied to these initial estimates. The algorithm is implemented as an iterative filter which can be explained with the aid of Figure 10. Two frames are shown, D P at point P and D Q at a neighbouring point Q. <p> Technical details regarding the updating functions for D P in terms of D P ff along with the transport model are described in <ref> [38] </ref> and [21]. At each iteration a residual error is computed and summed for each frame on S. <p> In curvature consistency the frames D i (x) and D i (x 0 ) were iteratively filtered such that curvature variation was minimized according to the assumption of locally constant curvature <ref> [34, 38, 21] </ref>.
