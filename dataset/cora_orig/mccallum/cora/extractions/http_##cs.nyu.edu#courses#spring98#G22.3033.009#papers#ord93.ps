Abstract: We consider a communication network shared by several selfish users. Each user seeks to optimize its own performance by controlling the routing of its given flow demand, giving rise to a non-cooperative game. We investigate the Nash equilibrium of such systems. For a two-node multiple-links system, uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium is proved under reasonable convexity conditions. It is shown that this Nash equilibrium point possesses interesting monotonicity properties. For general networks, these convexity conditions are not sufficient for guaranteeing uniqueness, and a counter example is presented. Nonetheless, uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium for general topologies is established under various assumptions.

Reference-contexts: For example, many advanced network routing protocols attempt to optimize average network delay. In modern networking, a single administration is no longer a valid assumption. In-ternetworking, for example <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, is a coalition of networks each belonging to a different administration sharing gateways and sometimes internal network resources. Another example is a set of different companies in the same neighborhood using wireless local area networks and sharing the same portion of the spectrum. <p> Each J i l satisfies: G2 J i l : <ref> [0; 1) I ! [0; 1] </ref>, a continuous function. G3 J i l is convex in f i l . G4 Wherever finite, J i l is continuously differentiable in f i l . <p> Each J i l satisfies: G2 J i l : [0; 1) I ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, a continuous function. G3 J i l is convex in f i l . G4 Wherever finite, J i l is continuously differentiable in f i l . <p> Thus, it is of interest to consider cost functions of the following form (see also [11, 16]): B1 J i l ; f l ) = f i B2 T l : <ref> [0; 1) !

Reference-contexts: In another paper Shenker [15] discusses at some length game theoretical issues related to networking problems. The routing standpoint has been scarcely considered in the literature. Lee and Cohen <ref> [16] </ref> consider a set of parallel M/M/c queues (which, in our context, could represent parallel links connecting two nodes). The users control the amount of flow through each queue (making this a routing problem) and consider a linear combination of the average queue length and customer delay as performance criteria. <p> This leads us to exploit the specific structure of our problem in order to prove uniqueness. We analyze the routing problem in two phases. First we consider a case of two nodes connected by a set of parallel links, similar to the setting considered by Lee and Cohen <ref> [16] </ref>, except that ours allows more general functions and not just those resulting from a queuing framework. This model is presented in Section 2. Existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium is established under fairly weak convexity properties, which are satisfied by standard network cost functions. <p> Nonetheless, we prove uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in several cases. First, sufficient conditions for uniqueness are derived based on [19], and their applicability is discussed. A second result establishes uniqueness for the case of symmetric users. Finally, we obtain a result similar to that of <ref> [16] </ref>, but for the general network environment. <p> Thus, it is of interest to consider cost functions of the following form (see also <ref> [11, 16] </ref>): B1 J i l ; f l ) = f i B2 T l : [0; 1) ! (0; 1]. B3 T l (f l ) is positive, strictly increasing and convex. B4 T l (f l ) is continuously differentiable. <p> Note that this all-positive assumption makes sense only when all users have the same source and destination nodes, which will be assumed in this sub-section. A similar result has been established in <ref> [16] </ref>, for the special case of the two-node parallel lines network. Theorem 3.3 Assume type-B cost functions.

Reference-contexts: This uniqueness problem is completely resolved in the present work. Another game theoretic treatment of a routing problem was considered in <ref> [17] </ref>, where existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium was shown for the special case of two exponential servers working in parallel, and two users, each employing a different cost function (namely, average delay and blocking probability).

Reference-contexts: Noncooperative games in the context of routing were studied also in the area of transportation networks. A fundamental result due to Dafermos and Sparrow <ref> [18] </ref> shows that the game problem can be solved via a standard network optimization problem, by a simple transform of the cost function.

Reference-contexts: In general, uniqueness (or even existence) of the Nash equilibrium is not guaranteed. A result due to Rosen <ref> [19] </ref> defines conditions for existence, uniqueness, and stability of Nash equilibria in convex games. This result is the basis of several subsequent works, such as that of Bovopoulos and Lazar [10]. <p> When the objective function is convex but not common to all users the setting becomes that of a convex game. As mentioned above and shown in the sequel, uniqueness of the Nash point cannot be derived directly from available results of convex game theory (such as <ref> [19] </ref>). This leads us to exploit the specific structure of our problem in order to prove uniqueness. We analyze the routing problem in two phases. <p> We show through an example that the above weak convexity conditions are not enough in order to guarantee the uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium. Nonetheless, we prove uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in several cases. First, sufficient conditions for uniqueness are derived based on <ref> [19] </ref>, and their applicability is discussed. A second result establishes uniqueness for the case of symmetric users. Finally, we obtain a result similar to that of [16], but for the general network environment. <p> Assumption G5 is then equivalent to the sum of link capacities being greater than the sum of the users' demands. Under the above assumptions, the routing game is equivalent to a convex game in the sense of <ref> [19] </ref>, and thus the existence of an NEP is guaranteed (Theorem 1 in [19]). Since some semantic differences do exist, we briefly outline the proof. <p> Under the above assumptions, the routing game is equivalent to a convex game in the sense of <ref> [19] </ref>, and thus the existence of an NEP is guaranteed (Theorem 1 in [19]).

In the present sub-section this result is applied to the network flow game. We first introduce the DSC conditions for our problem. <p> Some examples will be presented to illustrate the applicability of these results; these examples indicate that the derived conditions are quite useful for lightly loaded networks, but may fail to hold otherwise. Following <ref> [19] </ref>, the following notation will be used. <p> does not affect the NEPs.) The function (; ) : F ! &lt; is called diagonally strictly convex (DSC) if for every f ; ^ f 2 F holds ( ^ f f ) (g ( ^ f; ) g (f ; )) &gt; 0 : (16) Theorem 3.1 (Rosen <ref> [19] </ref>): If (f ; ) is DSC for some &gt; 0, then the NEP system flow configuration is unique. Note that constraints F on the flows of each user are independent of the others' flows, as required in Theorem 2 of [19]. <p> ; )) &gt; 0 : (16) Theorem 3.1 (Rosen <ref> [19] </ref>): If (f ; ) is DSC for some &gt; 0, then the NEP system flow configuration is unique. Note that constraints F on the flows of each user are independent of the others' flows, as required in Theorem 2 of [19]. We also note that allowing infinite values for the cost functions causes no problem, since by our Assumption G5 the costs are finite at each NEP, and the uniqueness proof of [19] goes through without modification. <p> on the flows of each user are independent of the others' flows, as required in Theorem 2 of <ref> [19] </ref>. We also note that allowing infinite values for the cost functions causes no problem, since by our Assumption G5 the costs are finite at each NEP, and the uniqueness proof of [19] goes through without modification. We proceed to formulate sufficient conditions for DSC which may be verified for each link separately. <p> Corollary 3.1 Assume that for some positive 2 &lt; I , the matrix G l (f l ; ) is positive definite for every f l 2 F l and l 2 L. Then the NEP is unique. Proof : As shown in <ref> [19, Theorem 6] </ref>, a sufficient condition for (f ; ) to be DSC over F is that G (f ; ) &gt; 0 for every f 2 F, where G (f ; ) is the (LI ) fi (LI ) Jacobian matrix of g (f ; ) with respect to f
