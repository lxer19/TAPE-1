Abstract: Human episodic memory provides a seemingly unlimited storage for everyday experiences, and a retrieval system that allows us to access the experiences with partial activation of their components. This paper presents a neural network model of episodic memory inspired by Dama-sio's idea of Convergence Zones. The model consists of a layer of perceptual feature maps and a binding layer. A perceptual feature pattern is coarse coded in the binding layer, and stored on the weights between layers. A partial activation of the stored features activates the binding pattern which in turn reactivates the entire stored pattern. A worst-case analysis shows that with realistic-size layers, the memory capacity of the model is several times larger than the number of units in the model, and could account for the large capacity of human episodic memory.

Reference-contexts: This means that storing and retrieving, for example, 10 8 memories would require in the order of 10 10 nodes and 10 20 connections. Given that the human brain is estimated to have about 10 11 neurons and 10 15 synapses <ref> (Jessell 1991) </ref>, this is clearly unrealistic. Despite vast amount of research in human memory, no clear understanding has yet emerged on exactly where and how the memory traces are represented in the brain. There is evidence for both localized encoding and for distributed encoding (Squire 1987).

Reference-contexts: small constant fi, a lower bound for successful retrieval is obtained: p success &gt; 1 (3j 1 + 3f (F j))fi: (15) For example, assuming each unit in the model corresponds to a vertical column in the cortex, it is reasonable to assume feature maps with 10 6 computational units <ref> (Sejnowski & Churchland 1989) </ref>. We can further assume that the system has 15 feature maps, 10 of which is used to cue the memory, and the binding layer consists of 10 5 units, with 150 used for each binding pattern.

Reference-contexts: Episodic memory is characterized by an extremely high capacity. New memories are formed every few seconds, and many of those persist in the memory for years, even decades <ref> (Squire 1987) </ref>. Another significant characteristic of human memory is content-addressability. Most of the memories can be retrieved simply by activating a partial representation of the experience, such as a sound, a smell, or a visual image. <p> Despite vast amount of research in human memory, no clear understanding has yet emerged on exactly where and how the memory traces are represented in the brain. There is evidence for both localized encoding and for distributed encoding <ref> (Squire 1987) </ref>. Damasio (1989b, 1989a) proposed a general framework, based on observations of typical patterns of injury-related memory deficits, that can potentially account for much of the data.
