Abstract: Technical Summary Report # 97-03 October 1996 ABSTRACT Given finite subset J IR n , and a point 2 IR n , we study in this paper the possible convergence, as h ! 0, of the coefficients in least-squares approximation to f ( + h) from the space spanned by (f ( + hj) j2J . We invoke the `least solution of the polynomial interpolation problem' to show that the coefficient do converge for a generic J and , provided that the underlying function f is sufficiently smooth. Moreover, in certain cases (e.g., in the case J [ for a rectangular mesh), the limit of the least-squares coefficients are shown to be independent of f , and are characterized by their polynomial accuracy. Finally, we employ a different argument to show that convergence of the least squares coefficients occurs also for a certain class of functions which are not "sufficiently smooth".

Reference-contexts: The paper is laid out as follows. In Section 2, we review relevant facts concerning the least solution of the polynomial interpolation problem <ref> (de Boor, Ron, 1990) </ref>. That least solution turns out to be the main tool in our study of Problem A for "sufficiently smooth" functions f that is carried out in Section 4. In that section, Theorem 1 is proved, together with some more general results. <p> As stated before, the limit coefficients are identified as the Lagrange functions of certain interpolation problems that involve radial basis functions (Buhmann, 1993, Dyn, 1989, Micchelli, 1986). 2. The least solution of the polynomial interpolation problem We briefly discuss here the least solution of the polynomial interpolation problem of <ref> (de Boor, Ron, 1990) </ref>, a tool that we require in our analysis in Section 4, and to a lesser extent in our analysis of Section 3. <p> For each J, there are of course many polynomial spaces P that interpolate correctly on J. In <ref> (de Boor, Ron, 1990, 1992a, 1992b) </ref> a correct polynomial space J , the least solution, of least possible degree and various other desired properties was constructed. <p> Our previous argument thus yields for that case that c j (; h) = o (1), and the proof is now complete. We recall the definition of general position from Section 2, and remind the reader that this is the generic situation: it is proved in <ref> (de Boor, Ron, 1990) </ref> that for any integer `, the sets J IR n with cardinality ` that are in general position form an open and dense subset (in IR `n ). <p> This observation holds for every smooth f ; here, "smooth" means lying in W ff 2 (IR 2 ), for some ff &gt; 1. Suppose now that J is not in general position. First, whether or not J is in general position, it follows from <ref> (de Boor, Ron, 1990) </ref> that one can always find j 2 J such that d (J nj; j) = M (J). On the other hand, for a generic , the value of d (Jnj; ) will be the smallest possible, i.e., m (Jnj) + 1. <p> For every ff m, and every f 2 L 2 (IR n ), the L 2 (IR n ) error in E h f j2J is O (h ff ), with ff the maximal integer for which D ff f 2 L 2 (IR n ). We note that <ref> (de Boor, Ron, 1990) </ref>, if a set J lies entirely on a line directed in the direction, then J = spanft 7! ( t) ` j 0 ` jJj 1g. In particular, for a colinear set J, M (J) = jJj 1. Proof of Theorem 4.

Reference-contexts: For our particular problem, the close relation between the decay of the error with h ! 0 and the smoothness class of f is even more basic: the mere definition of "smoothness" via the moduli of smoothness notion <ref> (cf., e.g., DeVore, Lorentz, 1993, p. 44) </ref> shows that smoothness can be defined, hence interpreted, as the ability to approximate a function well by close-by translates of it.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we conduct a study of certain extremal problems that are closely related to optimal finite difference schemes for finding numerical solutions of such problems. For relevant general information on difference methods connected with the Cauchy problem cf., e.g., <ref> (Iserles and Strang, 1983) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The above inner product is well-defined for all f; g 2 H, where H := f 2 S 0 j IR n Here, S 0 is the space of distributions dual to the Schwartz space of rapidly decreasing smooth test functions on IR n , cf., e.g., Jones <ref> (1982) </ref>. The above assumptions on the points we make from now on. We also find it convenient for the statement of the next theorem to define the space J := d = (d j ) j2J 2 IR J j j2J o 18 Our last result now is as follows.
