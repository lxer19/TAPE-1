Abstract: We present the architecture for data collection for the NSFNET backbone and difficulties with using the collected statistics for long-term network forecasting of certain traffic aspects. We describe relevant aspects of the NSFNET backbone architecture and the instrumentation for statistics collection. We then present long-term NSFNET data to elucidate long-term trends in both the reachability of Internet components via the NSFNET as well as the growing cross-section of traffic. We focus on the difficulties of forecasting and planning in an infrastructure whose protocol architecture and instrumentation for data collection was not designed to support such objectives.

Reference-contexts: III. NSFNET statistics collection mechanisms There are three classes of network statistics gathered from NSFNET information sources: interface statistics; packet categorization; and internodal delays. Interface statistics are produced from programs using the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) [5]. Specialized software packages perform packet categorization: the T1 backbone used NNStat <ref> [3] </ref> for collection; the T3 backbone uses ARTS (ANSnet Router Traffic Statistics) [1], a package with similar functionality. <p> The statistics gathering processor examined the header of every packet traversing the intra-NSS processor intercommunication facility and used a modified version of the NNStat package <ref> [3] </ref> to build statistical objects from the collected information. Because all packets traveled across the interconnection facility on their way through the node, the collection processor passively collected data without affecting switching throughput.

Several Internet resource discovery services (e.g., WAIS, WWW, gopher, prospero, mosaic <ref> [9] </ref>) have experienced tremendous growth in volume since their deployment. Other applications have also gained a greater proportion of network bandwidth: e.g., MUD (Multi-User Domain), a distributed electronic role playing environment; X-windows, for remote graphical displays across the network; and more recently real-time applications like packet video and audio.

Reference-contexts: But the number of silent networks has increased since announcement of the addressing guidelines outlined above. When service providers receive large blocks of Class C addresses in anticipation of and aligned with CIDR <ref> [10] </ref> requirements, they immediately configure the addresses in the policy routing database before assigning them to customers. This increases the number of silent networks in the NSFNET backbone configuration database.

Reference-contexts: Originally, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), at ISI (Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California), on behalf of DARPA, administered a space of 1 to 255 as the group of port numbers assigned to specific applications. For example, telnet received port assignment 23 <ref> [13] </ref>. <p> For example, they used port 513 for rlogin. Eventually network users started to use numbers above 1024 to specify more services, extending the lack of community coordination. In July 1992 <ref> [13] </ref>, the IANA extended the range of port assignments they manage to 0-1023. At this time, they also began to track a selected set of registered ports within the 1024-65535 range. <p> At this time, they also began to track a selected set of registered ports within the 1024-65535 range. IANA does not attempt to control the assignments of these ports; they only register port usage as a convenience to the community <ref> [13] </ref>. Figure 9 presents a schematic of the port number categories discussed. These port numbers are the only mechanism through which the NSFNET can monitor statistics on the aggregated distribution of applications on the backbone.

Besides sheer traffic volume, another growth metric is the number of connected networks as seen through traffic reaching the NSFNET backbone. backbone <ref> [17] </ref>. These NSFNET numbers are the only destinations to which the NSFNET backbone will route packets; every network client must have an assigned IP network number to receive traffic. The figure shows dramatic growth over the last few years, including substantial increases in the international area. <p> Merit/ANS categorizes packets into these ports if either the source or destination port in a given packet matches one of these numbers. However, even within this range, not all ports have a known assignment. So packets using undefined ports go into the unknown port category <ref> [17] </ref>.
