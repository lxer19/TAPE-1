Abstract: We propose a new approach to game tree search. We train up an evaluation function which returns, rather than a single number estimating the `value' of a position, a probability distribution P L (x). P L (x) is the probability that if we expanded leaf L to some depth, the backed up value of leaf L would then be found to be x. We describe how to propagate these distributions efficiently up the tree so that at any node n we compute without approximation the probability node n's negamax value is x given that a value is assigned to each leaf from its distribution. After we are done expanding the tree, the best move is the child of the root whose distribution has highest mean. Note that we take means at the child of the root after propagating, whereas the normal (Shannon) approach takes the mean at the leaves before propagating, which throws away information. Now we model the expansion of a leaf as selection of one value from its distribution. The total utility of all possible expansion is then by definition the ensemble sum over those possible leaf configurations for which the current favorite move is inferior to some alternate move, weighted by the probability of the leaf configuration and the amount the current favorite move is inferior. We propose as the natural measure of the expansion importance of leaf L, the expected absolute change in this utility when we expand leaf L. We support this proposal with several arguments including an approximation theorem valid in the limit that one expands until the remaining utility of expansion becomes small. In summary, we gather distributions at the leaves, propagate exactly all this information to the root, and incrementally grow a tree expanding approximately the most interesting leaf at each step. Under reasonable conditions, we accomplish all of this in time O(N ), where N is the number of leaves in the tree when we are done expanding. That is, we pay only a small constant factor overhead for all of our bookkeeping.
