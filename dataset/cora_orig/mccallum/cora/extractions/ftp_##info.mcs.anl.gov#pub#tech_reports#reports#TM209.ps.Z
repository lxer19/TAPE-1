Reference-contexts: Section 5 describes heuristics to derive constrained columns that preserve a common property despite independent mutations. Section 6 briefly describes other applications of the tool. The last section concludes the paper. 2 Background and Definitions In this section, some basic terminology is defined for genome analysis <ref> [1, 7] </ref> and Prolog [8], the target language for the development of analysis tools.

Reference-contexts: Further application of the framework, when combined with heuristic biochemical knowledge <ref> [2] </ref>, will facilitate understanding of the structure-function relationship of genome sequences. The rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2 discusses some background necessary for computer scientists to understand standard biological terminology, and introduces definitions used to explain our concept.

Reference-contexts: Majority rule is used to identify the value of the parent for the given values of children, 2. Probability of mutation is equal for every child. These two principles ensure minimum cumulative mutation count and have been cited in literature <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. This paper describes a two-pass algorithm for labeling. The first phase generates a set of all possible labels in a bottom-up manner by using majority rule at every internal node.
