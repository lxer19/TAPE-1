Title: Parallel Adaptive Mesh Refinement for Electronic Structure Calculations  
Author: Scott Kohn John Weare Elizabeth Ong Scott Baden 
Abstract: We have applied structured adaptive mesh refinement techniques to the solution of the LDA equations for electronic structure calculations. Local spatial refinement concentrates memory resources and numerical effort where it is most needed, near the atomic centers and in regions of rapidly varying charge density. The structured grid representation enables us to employ efficient iterative solver techniques such as conjugate gradients with multigrid preconditioning. We have parallelized our solver using an object-oriented adaptive mesh refinement framework.

Reference-contexts: The most common and successful techniques in use today include Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) methods that expand the LDA equations using a planewave basis set [17] and LCAO (Local Combination of Atomic Orbitals) methods that use a Gaussian basis set <ref> [1] </ref>. Other computational techniques include finite difference methods on uniform grids [6, 4], wavelets [7], finite elements with p-refinement (but not spatial refinement) [19], and adaptive coordinate methods [9, 10]. We are primarily interested in studying systems that exhibit multiple length scales and therefore require local spatial refinement [5].

Reference-contexts: All grids at the same level of the hierarchy have the same mesh spacing, but successive levels have finer spacing than the ones preceding it, providing a more accurate representation of the solution (see Figure 1). Structured adaptive mesh techniques were originally developed for computational fluid dynamics <ref> [2] </ref>. Although the data representations are similar, our eigenvalue problem has very different mathematical properties and requires different discretization techniques and solver algorithms. 3 Fig. 1.

Reference-contexts: A naive iterative method such as steepest descent would require too many iterations to converge for the adaptive approach. Therefore, we use an eigenvalue solver technique developed by Longsine and McCormick called Simultaneous Rayleigh Quotient Minimization with Subspace Diagonalization <ref> [15] </ref>. The basic idea behind this approach is to take iterative steps that minimize the Rayleigh Quotient: RQ ( ) = H where H is the Hamiltonian (2) of the Kohn-Sham equations. The algorithm begins by freezing the nonlinear terms in the Hamiltonian.

Higher order methods should have the additional benefit of reducing the number of levels of refinement and thus improving the condition number of our discretized problems. Another potential approach employs nonuniform Fast Fourier Transforms over the adaptive grid hierarchy.
