Abstract: We present algorithms for 3-D manipulation and conformational analysis of molecular chains, when bond length, bond angles and related dihedral angles remain fixed. These algorithms are useful for local deformations of linear molecules, exact ring closure in cyclic molecules and molecular embedding for short chains. Other possible applications include structure prediction, protein folding, conformation energy analysis and 3D molecular matching and docking. The algorithms are applicable to all serial molecular chains and make no asssumptions about their geometry. We make use of results on direct and inverse kinematics from robotics and mechanics literature and show the correspondence between kinematics and conformational analysis of molecules. In particular, we pose these problems algebraically and compute all the solutions making use of the structure of these equations and matrix computations. The algorithms have been implemented and perform well in practice. In particular, they take tens of milliseconds on current workstations for local deformations and chain closures on molecular chains consisting of six or fewer rotatable dihedral angles.

It is a variant on the usual distance geometry methods and makes use of the metric matrix as opposed to distance matrix. However, the application to ring structures has been limited to molecular chains, where all bond lengths and bond angles are equal. <p> In these cases it is assumed that the molecule is under no great strain, so that all bond lengths and bond angles are known from standard values taken from X-ray crystallographic studies on small molecules <ref> [Cri89] </ref>. These constraints are referred to as holonomic constraints. The goal of the embedding algorithms is to find all conformations which satisfy these constraints. In this section, we show the equivalence between the embedding problems and inverse kinematics. <p> Given the experimental and holonomic constraints, the algorithm finds upper and lower bounds for all distances (which satisfy the constraints) and using some random values in this range it computes the closest corresponding three-dimensional metric matrix. Crippen has extended the algorithm using linearized embedding and taking chirality into account <ref> [Cri89] </ref>. The overall process is iterative and may take considerable running time on some cases. Furthermore, even for small chains it is not guaranteed to compute all the configurations. 8 We show the equivalence between molecular embedding and inverse kinematics for small chains.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we only consider the inverse kinematics problem for serial chains with revolute joints. Initially, we consider chains with six rotatable joints (denoted as 6R) and later on extend the results to arbitrary chains. We use the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) formalism, <ref> [DH55] </ref>, to model a serial chain with n revolute joints. Each bond is represented by the line along its joint axis and the common normal to the next joint axis. In the case of parallel joints, any of the common normals can be chosen.

Reference-contexts: The resulting problem corresponds to solving three equations in three unknowns. Each equation has degree 6, however the highest degree term corresponds to x 2 3 x 2 5 . Such equations are solved using Dixon's formulation of resultant <ref> [Dix08] </ref> and reducing the problem to eigendecomposition of a 48 fi 48 matrix, followed by back substitution. 5 Extension to All Molecular Chains In the previous section we had considered molecular chains with six dihedral chains and reduced the problem to an eigendecomposition problem.

Reference-contexts: Given a particular geometry, we substitute the corresponding parameters. The parameters for the polypeptide geometry are highlighted in Section 5. 12 It is possible that for some special geometries Q is rank deficient. As a result, we perform the rank computation after substitution using the singular-value decompositions (SVD) <ref> [GL89] </ref>. If the rank, r, is less than 8 we only use r equations to eliminate the power products on the left hand side of (4) and thereby obtain (14 r) equations. Thus, the order of S in (5) is (14 r) fi 9.

Reference-contexts: These problems have been extensively studied in biochemistry and molecular modeling literature. Molecular chains are modeled using bond lengths, bond angles and dihedral angles. In the literature on conformational energy calculations, bond lengths and bond angles have been treated in two different ways, as variables or as fixed parameters <ref> [GoS70] </ref>. However, modeling the bond-length and bond-angle as variables significantly add to the complexity and even for small chains consisting of six or seven bonds, minimal energy computation becomes a non-trivial problem. <p> In their classic paper, Go and Scheraga highlight that the minimal energy conformations computed by fixing these parameters is a good guess to the actual minima and can be used along with a perturbation treatment for the energy minimization <ref> [GoS70] </ref>. Therefore, in this paper, we assume that the bond lengths and bond angles are fixed and compute the conformation of the molecular chains by changing the dihedral angles only. <p> Given the assumptions of fixed bond-lengths and bond-angles, two fundamental problems arise in conformational energy calculations: ring closure and local conformational deformations <ref> [GoS70] </ref>. The problem of ring closure arises when we deal with cyclic molecules, i.e. the calculation of dihedral angles which corresponds to exact ring closure. In conformational energy minimization procedures, one selects a starting conformation and alters it step by step such that the corresponding conformational energy decreases monotonically. <p> It is therefore, desired to have a cooperative variation of angles which confines the conformational changes to a local section of the chain. As a result we are interested in calculation of changes in dihedral angles, which cause local deformations of conformations in long polymer chains <ref> [GoS70, BA82, CMR89, BK85] </ref>. In this paper, We also address the molecular embedding problem, that is, to find atom positions that satisfies a set of geometric constraints. It is an important problem in interpreting data from NMR experiment [Cri89]. <p> For cyclic molecules having rotatable bonds in the rings, six degrees of freedom are lost due to the closure constraint. Go and Scheraga have proposed solutions to computing the ring conformations <ref> [GoS70, GoS73] </ref>. The algorithm in [GoS70] is restricted to molecular chains where the rotation can take place about all backbone bonds and the methods in [GoS73] are for symmetric chains only. They reduce the problem to computing roots of a univariate polynomial. <p> For cyclic molecules having rotatable bonds in the rings, six degrees of freedom are lost due to the closure constraint. Go and Scheraga have proposed solutions to computing the ring conformations [GoS70, GoS73]. The algorithm in <ref> [GoS70] </ref> is restricted to molecular chains where the rotation can take place about all backbone bonds and the methods in [GoS73] are for symmetric chains only. They reduce the problem to computing roots of a univariate polynomial. <p> n corresponds to the number of rotatable in the selected chain. 2.3 Cases of Rotation about All Backbone Bonds Go and Scheraga have considered a restricted version of the inverse kinematics problem, when the rotation can take place about all backbone bonds (as opposed to a few selected dihedral angles) <ref> [GoS70] </ref>. This turns out to be a special case of the inverse kinematics problem as well. In particular, the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters of such a chain correspond exactly to: a i = 0, d i = bond length and ff i = bond angle.

Since we are only concerned with main chain conformation, the bond lengths and bond angles of C-H are irrelevant to our analysis. It was proved in <ref> [GoS73] </ref> that cyclohexane has infinite geometrically possible conformation due to its structural symmetry. In the following example, we slightly increase the length of the last bond. Since the symmetry no longer holds, we obtain a finite set of solutions.

Reference-contexts: There is a considerable amount of literature on exhaustive methods. A recent survey of different methods is given in <ref> [HK88] </ref>. The complexity of the search methods is an exponential function of the number of rotatable joints and therefore limited to chains with low n. For cyclic molecules having rotatable bonds in the rings, six degrees of freedom are lost due to the closure constraint.

We make use of the algebraic reduction of the problem to a univariate system presented by Raghavan and Roth <ref> [RR89] </ref>. However the symbolic derivation highlighted by Raghavan and Roth does not take care of all the geometries (e.g. the polypeptide configurations). As opposed to reducing the problem to finding roots of a univariate polynomial, we formulate it as an eigenvalue problem. <p> The relationship expressed in (4) helps us in eliminating four of the five variables.

M (x 3 ) is a 12 fi 12 matrix polynomial of degree 2.

Reference-contexts: However, the application to ring structures has been limited to molecular chains, where all bond lengths and bond angles are equal. Other approaches for molecular conformations are based on stochastic optimization and Monte Carlo analysis <ref> [GoS78, Sau89, BK85] </ref>. These can be slow in practice and are not guaranteed to find all the solutions.

Reference-contexts: Algorithms based on distance geometry to study the ring systems are proposed in [We83, PD92]. They use a distance matrix to generate a set of cartesian coordinates that satisfies the original set of distances as much as possible. A similar approach based on successive infinitesimal rotations is presented by <ref> [SLP86] </ref>. Although these approaches make no assumption about the geometry of molecules, they are relatively slow in practice, may fail to converge and cannot be used for analytic computation of the conformation space for even small chains.

Reference-contexts: These can be slow in practice and are not guaranteed to find all the solutions. In this paper, we reduce the problem of pose-computation to a system of algebraic equations and show how they relate to the problems of direct and inverse kinematics in mechanics and robotics <ref> [Cra89, SV89] </ref>. In particular, we show the correspondence between molecular conforma-tional analysis and inverse kinematics of serial manipulators. We also show how inverse kinematics can be used to solve the molecular embedding problem for short chains. <p> Given the pose of the end effector (the position and orientation), the problem corresponds to computing the joint displacements for that pose <ref> [SV89] </ref>. A robot manipulator may consist of prismatic, revolute or spherical joints. A molecular chain with fixed bond lengths and bond angles corresponds to a serial manipulator with revolute joints. Therefore, we only consider the inverse kinematics problem for serial chains with revolute joints.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, We also address the molecular embedding problem, that is, to find atom positions that satisfies a set of geometric constraints. It is an important problem in interpreting data from NMR experiment [Cri89]. Many interactive systems for molecular modeling such as Sybyl <ref> [Tri88] </ref> and Insight [Bio91] provide capabilities for building and changing molecular models by rotating the dihedral angles.

Reference-contexts: The matrix polynomial M (x 3 ) is regular if its symbolic determinant is non-zero. Otherwise it is a singular matrix polynomial. We are interested in computing the zeros of its determinant. For singular matrix polynomials it corresponds to computing the eigenvalues of the matrix polynomial <ref> [VDD83] </ref>. The following theorem shows how this problem of zero computation can be linearized, and the problem of inverse kinematics is reduced to computing appropriate zeros of a matrix pencil of the form, A xB [MC92, VDD83]. <p> For singular matrix polynomials it corresponds to computing the eigenvalues of the matrix polynomial [VDD83].

Reference-contexts: The main advantages of the matrix formulation are efficiency and accuracy. The reduction to a univariate polynomial involves expanding a symbolic determinant, which is relatively expensive.

Reference-contexts: Given a 6R manipulator with a pose of the end-effector, the maximum number of solutions (assuming a finite number of solutions) is 16 as shown in [Pri86, LL88, RR89].

In this section, we consider the problem of inverse kinematics for a molecular chain with six revolute joints. Chains with more than six joints or fewer than six joints are considered in next section.
