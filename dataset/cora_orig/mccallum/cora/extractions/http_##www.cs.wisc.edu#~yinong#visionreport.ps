Title: A Spherical Image Mosaicing System  
Author: Todd M. Bezenek Yinong Wei 
Date: December 18, 1995  
Abstract: The paper describes an image mosaicing system that is different from those see by the authors in that the mosaic is built on a sphere rather than on some other geometric object. The system uses a sphere building program to map overlapping images onto a sphere. The images are required to have been rendered in a system with a fixed center of projection but different projection directions. The fact that the destination is a sphere allows the images to represent the entire possible viewing area. The resulting sphere is saved to a file and later can be used to create views in any direction by using a viewing program.

Reference-contexts: The sphere can be broken up into alternating pentagonal and hexagonal areas. Then, each area could be tessellated in to evenly distributed pixels. This may produce distortion across the area boundaries, so it was discarded. The method that we use defines pixels on the sphere via using spherical coordinates <ref> [Swokowski, 1979] </ref>. The set of possible azimuth and elevation values are broken into equal size intervals. The intervals are used as the pixels (see figure 2). 3.3 Projecting to the sphere To project to point D on the image, we simply apply equations 1-7 and apply interpolation as discussed above.
