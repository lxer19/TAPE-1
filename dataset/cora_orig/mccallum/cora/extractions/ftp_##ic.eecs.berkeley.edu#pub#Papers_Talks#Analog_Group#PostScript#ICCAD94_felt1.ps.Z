Abstract: This paper presents a new methodology for measuring MOS transistor current mismatch and a new transistor current mismatch model. The new methodology is based on extracting the mismatch information from a fully functional circuit rather than on probing individual devices; this extraction leads to more efficient and more accurate mismatch measurement. The new model characterizes the total mismatch as a sum of two components, one systematic and the other random. For our process, we attribute nearly half of the mismatch to the systematic component, which we model as a linear gradient across the die. Furthermore, we present a new model for the random component of the mismatch which is 60% more accurate, on average, than existing models.

Reference-contexts: The remainder of the mismatch, in which no apparent trend is observed, falls under the category of random mismatch. Some of the causes of transistor current mismatch, as described in <ref> [1] </ref>, are edge effects, implantation and surface state charges, oxide effects and mobility effects. The presence of process gradients causes systematic mismatch in the parameter value of the device. <p> Section 4 presents our conclusions. 2 Previous Work In most of the previous work, either the systematic mismatch is not considered at all [3], [4] or its effect is modeled as a stochastic process with a long correlation distance <ref> [1] </ref>, [5]. In the Fourier domain this effect is modeled as a fixed low frequency contribution with a spatial frequency inversely proportional to the wafer diameter. Normal distribution is considered a reasonable approximation for this [1]. <p> [4] or its effect is modeled as a stochastic process with a long correlation distance <ref> [1] </ref>, [5]. In the Fourier domain this effect is modeled as a fixed low frequency contribution with a spatial frequency inversely proportional to the wafer diameter. Normal distribution is considered a reasonable approximation for this [1]. The drain current through a transistor operating in the saturation region is given by I = 2 2 where I is the drain current, K is the conductance constant, V T is the threshold voltage, and V GS is the drain-to-source voltage. <p> Pelgrom et. al. also propose a similar model by doing analysis in the frequency domain <ref> [1] </ref>. They show that if the random variations in a parameter, P , are caused by a process which can be modeled as spatial white noise, then the variance of that parameter is inversely proportional to the device area. <p> The nominal current for a transistor is taken to be the average current over all the transistors in the linear array. The mismatch is defined as mismatch [i] = actual current [i] nominal current (8) Notice that L [65] L <ref> [1] </ref>, L [66] L [2], : : : , L [127] L [63], all represent the value of current carried by the transistor that switches first in the linear array. By taking the average of all these values, we significantly reduce the noise from our measurements. <p> As an example, consider once again DAC46. L <ref> [1] </ref> L [0] represents the value of the current for the the smallest current element. <p> 2 (V GS V T ) where K and V T is given by 2 K 2 = Area (18) 2 (V GS V T ) k 2 Area (V GS V T ) 2 + (V GS V T ) The above model differs from the model proposed in <ref> [1] </ref> in two ways. First, we do not have any distance-dependent term because we have already accounted for the systematic mismatch. <p> In Table 5 we present the actual values of I =I vs. the values predicted by our model, along with the percentage errors. The average error from the actual values is approximately 12%. A comparison of our model with that in <ref> [1] </ref> and [4] is presented in Table 6.

Reference-contexts: The presence of process gradients causes systematic mismatch in the parameter value of the device. Some of the sources of systematic mismatch, as described in <ref> [2] </ref>, are variations in gate dimensions, gate-oxide thickness gradients, variations in channel doping, and source/drain asymmetry, such as introduced by the tilt angle of ion implants. Most prior studies have been confined to the modeling of random mismatch. <p> Finally, Gregor <ref> [2] </ref> has reported some work on systematic mismatch, but it is concerned primarily with the causes of mismatch rather than with its modeling. 3 Approach In this section we first give a description of the mismatch extraction methodology used to obtain the mismatch information for this study. <p> The nominal current for a transistor is taken to be the average current over all the transistors in the linear array. The mismatch is defined as mismatch [i] = actual current [i] nominal current (8) Notice that L [65] L [1], L [66] L <ref> [2] </ref>, : : : , L [127] L [63], all represent the value of current carried by the transistor that switches first in the linear array. By taking the average of all these values, we significantly reduce the noise from our measurements. <p> As an example, consider once again DAC46. L [1] L [0] represents the value of the current for the the smallest current element. L <ref> [2] </ref> L [0] represents the the value when the transistor corresponding to the next significant bit is ON, which actually represents the summed current output of two transistors that are connected in parallel as described in Section 3.1.

Reference-contexts: This requirement is satisfied by using a behavioral simulator for the system which accurately models mismatch, such as the data converter behavioral model described in <ref> [6] </ref>. Note that the reverse mapping is particularly straightforward for current-source D/A converters, such as the ones used in this research, as illustrated in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2. Three different 10-bit DAC architectures were available for this study.
