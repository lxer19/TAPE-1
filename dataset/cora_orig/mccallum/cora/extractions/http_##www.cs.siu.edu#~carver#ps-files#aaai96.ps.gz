Abstract: The functionally-accurate, cooperative (FA/C) distributed problem-solving paradigm is one approach for organizing distributed problem solving among homogeneous, cooperating agents. A key assumption of the FA/C model has been that the agents' local solutions can substitute for the raw data in determining the global solutions. This is not the case in general, however. Does this mean that researchers' intuitions have been wrong and/or that FA/C problem solving is not likely to be effective? We suggest that some domains have a characteristic that can account for the success of exchanging mainly local solutions. We call such problems nearly monotonic. This concept is discussed in the context of FA/C-based distributed sensor interpretation.

Reference-contexts: From our experience, it appears that for SI problems both hypothesis belief and hypothesis type are important factors. Another possibility is the "quantity" of data supporting the hypothesis or the fraction of the overall data that has been processed. The RESUN SI framework <ref> (Carver & Lesser 1991) </ref> also provides detailed information about the reasons for uncertainty in beliefs, and such information may be necessary to identify hypotheses that are reliable enough to be assumed for global solutions.

Reference-contexts: One possible definition of best is the most probable explanation (MPE) (Pearl 1988) given the available data. The problem with this definition is that for many SI problems it is impractical to compute the MPE or exact belief ratings (conditional probabilities). <ref> (Carver & Lesser 1994) </ref> contains an explanation of this issue. 1 We will simply assume here that even centralized SI systems usually must use approximate, satisficing approaches to construct solutions (so solutions are only approximations of the MPE). 2 In a centralized SI system, all of the data is available to

Reference-contexts: DRESUN <ref> (Carver & Lesser 1995a) </ref> allows hypotheses to be "external evidence" for hypotheses of the same type. this is clearly more efficient, in general beliefs for com-bination hypotheses cannot be precisely computed in this way (i.e., without access to the supporting data).

Reference-contexts: The developers of the FA/C paradigm certainly believed that local solutions (and other abstract hypotheses, or "results") could substitute for the raw data in determining global solutions. <ref> (Lesser & Corkill 1981) </ref> refered to "consistency checking" of the tentative local solutions with results received from other nodes as "an important part of the FA/C approach." When there were inter-agent subproblem interactions, agents would transmit their local solutions and check the consistency of the related components of these solutions.

Reference-contexts: An interpretation of a data set is an explanation of what caused all of the data. Typically it will be a composite of a set of hypotheses whose types are from a specified subset of the abstraction types (the explanation corpus <ref> (Pearl 1988) </ref>), each of which explains some subset of the data, and which together explain all of the data. In general, there will be multiple possible interpretations of a data set. <p> In general, there will be multiple possible interpretations of a data set.
