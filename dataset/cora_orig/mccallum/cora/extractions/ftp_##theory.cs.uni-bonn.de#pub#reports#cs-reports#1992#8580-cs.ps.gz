Abstract: We investigate the impact of randomization on the complexity of deciding membership in a (semi-)algebraic subset X ae R m . Examples are exhibited where allowing for a certain error probability * in the answer of the algorithms the complexity of decision problems decreases. A randomized ( k ; f=; g)-decision tree (k R a subfield) over m will be defined as a pair (T; ) where a probability measure on some R n and T is a ( k ; f=; g)-decision tree over m + n. We prove a general lower bound on the average decision complexity for testing membership in an irreducible algebraic subset X ae R m and apply it to k-generic complete intersection of polynomials of the same degree, extending results in [4, 6]. We also give applications to nongeneric cases, such as graphs of elementary symmetric functions, SL(m; R), and determinant varieties, extending results in [Li 90].

Reference-contexts: We will use some real algebraic geometry, and the reader is assumed to be familiar with its basic concepts. For this theory we refer to the book by Bochnak, Coste and Roy <ref> [BCR 86] </ref>; see also Knebusch and Scheiderer [KS 89, chapt. III]. As far as complexity theory is concerned the reader is assumed to be familiar with [BL 91, sections 1-4]. For some overview on lower bounds on decision complexity see e.g. the introduction of [BL 91]. <p> Our analysis will show that in several cases not much more decreasing is possible. In the sequel we will apply some real algebraic geometry (cf. <ref> [BCR 86] </ref>). Let ff = (p; ff ) 2 Spec r R [x 1 ; : : : ; x m ] be given. <p> x has to be interpreted in A m . 6 Finally let us recall that for an irreducible algebraic subset V R m the central points 2 CentV := RegV are characterized by dim V = dimV where dim V is the (local) dimension of V in the point (cf. <ref> [BCR 86, 7.6.1] </ref>). 3 A general lower bound Before stating our main result we need to recall a definition from [Li 90]. Let X ae Y R m be irreducible algebraic subsets. <p> If X ae Y R m are irreducible algebraic subsets then we call I (X) 2 SpecP (Y ) central if one of the following equivalent conditions are satisfied (cf. <ref> [BCR 86, 7.6.2, 10.2.4] </ref>): (C1) I (X) is the center in P (Y ) of a real place of K (Y ) which is finite over P (Y ), (C2) 9ff 2 Spec r K (X) 9fi 2 Spec r K (Y ) : fi generalization of ff in Spec r <p> If Y ae R 3 is the Cartan umbrella (see <ref> [BCR 86, 3.1.2 d), p. 53] </ref>) then it is not satisfied for X = SingY ; it is satisfied in the case of [BCR 86, 3.1.2 e), p. 53].) 8 Corollary 3.3 If X ae Y R m are irreducible algebraic subsets, I (X) 2 SpecP (Y ) central, then for <p> If Y ae R 3 is the Cartan umbrella (see [BCR 86, 3.1.2 d), p. 53]) then it is not satisfied for X = SingY ; it is satisfied in the case of <ref> [BCR 86, 3.1.2 e), p. 53] </ref>.) 8 Corollary 3.3 If X ae Y R m are irreducible algebraic subsets, I (X) 2 SpecP (Y ) central, then for algebraic probability measures : B (R n ) !

Then by <ref> [BCR 86, 7.5.8] </ref> there is an ff 2 ~ W with dimff = dimS. <p> Obviously, we have S n W int V U . By the way of contradiction we assume that dimW = dimS. Then by [BCR 86, 7.5.8] there is an ff 2 ~ W with dimff = dimS. As ff 2 ~ V n ~ U we conclude by <ref> [BCR 86, 7.1.20] </ref> that there is a generalization fi of ff in ~ V n ~ U , contradicting (a). (b) ) (a): Assume S n W int V U for some W ae S with dimW &lt; dimS. <p> If ff 2 ~ S, dimff = dimS then by <ref> [BCR 86, 7.5.8] </ref> ff 2 ~ S n ~ W int ~ V ~ U . <p> If ff 2 ~ S, dimff = dimS then by [BCR 86, 7.5.8] ff 2 ~ S n ~ W int ~ V ~ U . As open constructible sets are stable under generalization (cf. <ref> [BCR 86, 7.1.21] </ref>) every generalization fi 2 ~ V of ff lies also in ~ U . 2 Lemma 3.5 Let X Y R m be irreducible algebraic subsets, c : k ! N a cost function. <p> (c; X fi V; Y fi V ) is of transfer type: factor the above morphism as O X;Y ! (O X;Y R P (V )) d ! O XfiV;Y fiV where d 2 O X;Y R P (V ) is a suitably chosen denominator, and use the Artin-Lang Theorem <ref> [BCR 86, 4.1.2] </ref> to construct a retraction of the first morphism mapping the coordinate ring P (V ) of V into R. 2 Lemma 3.6 Let T be an ( k ; P )-decision tree over m, X R m be an irreducible algebraic subset and let X 0 X be <p> ExT . (b) If X 00 X 0 is an arbitrary but dense subset of X 0 then X 00 ExT ) ~ X 0 " Spec r K (X) ExT: Proof. (a): X 0 " ExT is a semi-algebraic subset of X 0 ; so the statement follows from <ref> [BCR 86, 7.5.8] </ref> applied to its complement in X 0 . (b): Let ff 2 ~ X 0 " Spec r K (X) and consider the locally closed Cell (T; ff) := ffi : T fi = T ff g Spec r R [x 1 ; : : : ; x <p> [x] d ; x) satisfying one of the following four alternatives: f 1 (ff) f 2 (ff) and f 1 (fi) &gt; f 2 (fi); f 1 (ff) = f 2 (ff) and f 1 (fi) 6= f 2 (fi); By assumption fi is a generalization of ff, so by <ref> [BCR 86, 7.1.18] </ref> the second and fourth one are impossible, and in the remaining cases (f 1 f 2 )(ff) = 0; (f 1 f 2 )(fi) 6= 0 and we are done.

The second inequality follows analogously, using <ref> [Bu 92, Thm. 2.5, Prop. 4.3, Lemma 4.7] </ref>. 2 We are going to design a randomized ( k ; P )-decision tree (T; ) over some s + m for some fig fi X ae fig fi R m (ae R s fi R m ).

Reference-contexts: Example 2. Let X := f (; i) : i = oe ()g ae R 2m denote the graph of the mapping given by all elementary symmetric functions oe 1 ; : : : ; oe m . By Strassen <ref> [St 83] </ref> (over C ) and the extension by Monta~na-Pardo-Recio [MRR 90] of Ben-Or [Be 83] the number of multiplications, divisions and comparisons necessary to test membership in X (deterministically) is at least of order of magnitude m log m.

Reference-contexts: These lower bounds remain even true for the 3 membership problems of the respective sets of rational points, and extend results in Lickteig [Li 90]. (For decision complexity and rational points see also <ref> [Be 83, Hi 91, Ya 89] </ref>.) As in [Bu 92, BL 91] we follow the approach inititated in [Li 90] to prove lower bounds on decision complexity. We will use some real algebraic geometry, and the reader is assumed to be familiar with its basic concepts.
