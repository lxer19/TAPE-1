Reference-contexts: Our aim is to construct a real structure on k 1 . By the real structure we mean an embedding k 1 ae k 2 ( p where k 2 is a real ordered field, see <ref> [1] </ref>. Compute the discriminant 0 6= = Res Z ('; ' 0 Find consequently z 1 ; : : : ; z l 2 Q such that (z 1 ; : : : ; z i ; t i+1 ; : : : ; t n ) 6= 0. <p> R 1 ; I 1 2 Q [Z] with deg Z R 1 ; deg Z I 1 &lt; deg Z , such that for a chosen not real root j of ' we have j = R 1 () + p 1 I 1 () in the field Q <ref> [ ; 1 ] </ref>. p 1 + 1) be a separable Q-algebra, where j 1 = Z mod (' 1 ; Z 2 p 1 + 1): Let v 1 = 1 2 1 (jj 1 ); v 1 ; v 2 2 A. <p> Factor = Q j j into the product of ireducible polynomials j 2 Q [Z], lc Z j = 1. Set Q <ref> [ j ; 1 ] </ref> = Q [Z; Z 1 ]=( j ; Z 2 1 +1), where j = Z mod ( j ; Z 2 1 +1), 1 = 1 + 1). <p> Then we have j = j (1) + p 1 j (2) . The element ~j = j (1) 1 j (2) is a root of the polynomial ' 1 = '=(Z j) 2 Q [j][Z] ae Q <ref> [ ; 1 ] </ref>[[u 1 ; : : : ; u l ]][Z], since ' 2 Q [t 1 ; : : : ; t l ; Z]. Set = j (1) +cj (2) where c is the same as for v = v 1 +cv 2 , see above. <p> Let A = B <ref> [j; j 1 ; 1 ] </ref> = B [j][Z; Z 1 ]=(' 1 ; Z 2 where j 1 = Z mod (' 1 ; Z 2 1 + 1), 1 = Z 1 mod (' 1 ; Z 2 1 + 1). <p> So there exists a unique index i 1 such that i 1 () = 0. This equality can be considered as an equality in the ring Q <ref> [ ; 1 ] </ref>[[u 1 ; : : : ; u l ]]. Therefore, i 1 (z 1 ; : : : ; z l ; ) = 0 and i 0 = i 1 , = i 1 , since is separable. <p> PROOF. Follows directly from the description of Q ~ (t 1 ; : : : ; t l ) as a field of multiple fraction-power series over real closure ~ Q of Q, see e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>. 2 Solving an auxiliary system over the field of real numbers In this section by the proof of Lemma 5 we follow [10]. The proof of the analogue of Lemma 5 in [10] is based in its turn on the idea from [9]. <p> This gives the required independnt of ff bijection. The corollary is proved. LEMMA 7. The assertion (b) of Lemma 6 when one consider classic topology can be expressed in the language L ( ~ Q) of the first order of the real closed field ~ Q, see <ref> [1] </ref>. PROOF. Let the bound for the degree d be fixed and f i = P X 1 : : : X j n n where f i;j 1 ; ::: ;j n 2 Rfor all i; j 1 ; : : : ; j n . <p> PROOF. Consider at first the topology of a really closed field. Then by Lemma 7, by the assertion (b) of Lemma 6 and the transfer principle, see <ref> [1] </ref>, the first statement of the Lemma is satisfied but when the closure U (R) is considered in the topology of the really closed field R. 11 The Zariski topology in (A 1 fi A n )(R) is weaker than the topology of the really closed field. <p> (" 1 ; " 2 ) of K (" 1 ; " 2 ) we have the embedding of real ordered fields ~ K (" 1 ; " 2 ) ae 1 ; 2 2 N 1 = 1 1 = 2 herewith the last field is really closed, see <ref> [1] </ref>. (15) Now our aim is to find the points form (U 1 " f" = 0g) which are solutions of (10).

Reference-contexts: The working time of the algorithm is polynomial in the size of input and d n . The problem of the computation of the dimension has attracted the attention of specialists for approximately ten years. In <ref> [3] </ref> an algorithm is suggested for decomposing an algebraic variety into the irreducible components with the complexity polynomial in d n 2 . This algorithm has the best known bound for the complexity of the computation of the dimension in the case of arbitrary characteristic. <p> These results afford to compute all the components of a given dimension fl Research supported by the Volkswagen-Stiftung, Program on Computational Complexity, University of Bonn 1 c of the variety in time polynomial in d (c+1)(nc) and the size of input which proves the hypothesis from <ref> [3] </ref>. We are going to present these algorithms in next papers. By constructing the algorithm in this work the technics of the real algebraic geometry is essentially used. Here the result from [10] is crucial which in its turn is based on the result of [9], see below section 2. <p> REMARK. The working time of the algorithm from the theorem is essentialy the same as by solving system of polynomial equations with a finite set of solutions in projective space. So it can be formulated also in the case when l is not fixed, see <ref> [3] </ref>. 1 Constructing a real structure on the constant field In this section l is not fixed. <p> But this general fact can be obtained by the localization of the rings of regular functions C [W " fZ ff 6= 0; " 0 6= 0g] = A ff , 0 ff n, relatively to the multiplicatively closed set S = C ["]nf0g, c.f. <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> Denote for brevity L (s) j = L j , s + 1 j n. Using the algorithm from <ref> [3] </ref>, see also [8], find all the points fx j g 1jN of the set V s . <p> Remind that in output of the algorithm from <ref> [3] </ref> for every j we have an isomorphism of fields over k k x j;0 ; : : : ; x j;ff where ' j (o j ) = 0, ' j 2 k [Z] is an irreducible polynomial, x j;ff 6= 0. <p> The proof is without changes. The assertion (b) is satisfied if one changes C for K 1 or K 1 . The proof also is the same. System (12) has a finite number of solutions in P 2n+2 (K 1 (")). We solve system (12) using the algorithm from <ref> [3] </ref> and find all the irreducible and defined over K 1 (") components v ff of W 1 . <p> Note that V 0 1 ae U 1 and 1 " f" = 0g = U 1 " f" = 0g.
