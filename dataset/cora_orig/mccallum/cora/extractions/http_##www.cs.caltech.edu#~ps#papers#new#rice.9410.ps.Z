Title: Adaptive Wave Propagation Modeling  
Author: Raymond O. Wells, Jr.

Affiliation: Department of Mathematics, Rice University  
Abstract: This paper discusses several current attempts to use acoustic and electromagnetic wave propagation for modeling physical phenomena and the role that wavelet analysis is playing in these efforts. The first problem involves recent application of wavelets to computational fluid dynamics. The second problem involves geophysical modeling of the ocean floor, using acoustic waves, and wavelets have recently been shown to play an important role here already. The third problem involves modeling of SAR radar images in the context of automatic target recognition efforts. The fourth problem is global illumination in computer graphics, i.e., simulation of reflected and absorbed light for everyday environments. The role of wavelets is more embryonic in these latter two areas, but there are some common principles in all of these modeling efforts, and the methodology of wavelets seems well suited to certain aspects of these problems.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW In 1988 Daubechies published her seminal paper on compactly supported wavelets <ref> [8] </ref>. Since that time there have been major developments in the applications of wavelets to many fields of science and engineering. In this paper we want to discuss certain problems concerning wave propagation modeling in which wavelets are playing (or in some cases seem likely to play) a significant role. <p> The fundamental theorem of Daubechies and Lawton is that ' 0 j is a tight frame for L 2 (R) for any wavelet matrix a (see <ref> [8] </ref>, [20]), i.e., any f 2 L 2 (R) has an L 2 expansion of the form f = f k ' 0 X j j where f k = f (x)' 0 j Z j For a generic wavelet matrix, (2.5) is an orthonormal system, and (2.6) is the usual

Reference-contexts: In Daubechies' paper she denoted these functions by N '(x); N (x), where N = g. We call ' Dg the Daubechies scaling function of genus g, and Dg the Daubechies wavelet function of genus g, for g 2 N (the positive integers). Daubechies' recent book <ref> [9] </ref> contains a thorough discussion of all of these issues. In particular, the Daubechies wavelets have specific differentiability properties, namely, ' 2 C ff (g) , where ff is affine linear, and for g 3, ' 2 C 1 .

Reference-contexts: Moreover, it has become clear that the tools of computational fluid mechanics in particular have serious applications to EM wave propagation problems (see for instance [33], where an example of this is carried out quite explicitly). In the paper <ref> [10] </ref>, we find specific examples of such fluid flow type calculations applied to wave propagation problems. The goal of such a study is to obtain a detailed description of the reflected signal according to the nature of the geometry and physical characteristics of the illuminated area (radar footprint). <p> In principle, this will require solving Maxwells's equations with appropriate boundary conditions and convenient absorbing boundary conditions to reduce the size of the computational domain. Recently there have been solutions developed <ref> [10] </ref> for two-dimensional scattering problems of large wave number (i.e., D= 1, where D is a characteristic length, the diameter of the reflector, for example, and is the wavelength of the carrier EM wave). The new methodology combines variational approximation and least squares based iterative methods. <p> The new methodology combines variational approximation and least squares based iterative methods. It is very well suited to domain decomposition and fictitious domain base solutions methods. This implies in turn that the finite-element methods which have been employed in <ref> [10] </ref> (see also [24]) can be improved by a wavelet-Galerkin adapation in the spirit of the research described in Section 3. A review of direct time integration methods for Maxwell's equations is given in [33]. The two-dimensional calcuation carried out in [10] is quite demanding (280,000 triangles, 140,000 grid points). <p> that the finite-element methods which have been employed in <ref> [10] </ref> (see also [24]) can be improved by a wavelet-Galerkin adapation in the spirit of the research described in Section 3.

Three-dimensional calculations will definitely require the use of massively parallel machines, since practical problems may include 10 6 to 10 9 grid points.

Reference-contexts: In another direction, there have been both single-scale and multiscale algorithms for solving elliptic boundary-value problems using wavelets a the fundamental representational tool. In [38] one finds a review of single-scale developments in this direction, and the review article <ref> [11] </ref> emphasizes the role of wavelets in computational fluid dynamics. More recently, there have been some developments of algorithms which utilize the multiscale nature of wavelets. In this direction we note the paper by Rieder [28], which develops multigrid algorithms for boundary value problems in the one-dimensional case.

Reference-contexts: The second problem mentioned above concerns an attempt to fashion a multigrid algorithm for an elliptic boundary-value problem with a very general boundary. The papers [40], [39], <ref> [13] </ref> give a systematic development of single-scale wavelet solutions for model elliptic boundary-value problems for very general boundaries (including both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions).

Reference-contexts: A recent development in this direction is the viscoelastic type of model developed in [32,31]. In this model the ocean basement is modeled by a fractal boundary <ref> [14] </ref>, and a finite-difference scheme is used for the solution of the viscoelastic equations in a region with absorbing boundary conditions simulating long-range asymptotic conditions in the ocean.

Reference-contexts: The usual finite-element bases consist of elementary spline functions of low order (piecewise linear, piecewise quadratic, etc.) In a recent paper <ref> [15] </ref> it has been shown how the wavelet solution of an integral equation of the type (6.15) can be carried out in a manner similar to the finite-element approach described, but using wavelets of specific coefficient length (corresponding to a certain degree of smoothness).

By choosing a 1 2g1k ; we see that the orthogonality conditions in (2.2) and (2.3) are satisfied if they are satisfied for the first row. <p> (2.1), we can find compactly supported scaling functions and wavelet functions which are in L 2 (R) and which satisfy '(x) = k=0 k '(2x k); 2g1 X a 1 More generally we can choose an m fi mg wavelet matrix satisfying conditions similar to (2.1) and (2.2) above (see <ref> [18] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: This was preceded by earlier work on Burgers' equation (see, e.g., <ref> [19] </ref>). The overlapping nature of the wavelet representation as well as the longer-length wavelet-type filters which enter into these papers in a computational manner seem to help control the stability of the shock waves and vortex flows which arise in the Burgers and Euler flow settings.

A recent development in this direction is the viscoelastic type of model developed in [32,31].

Reference-contexts: A natural alternative is to use wavelet-based approximations (using a wavelet-Galerkin scheme, exploiting the orthogonality of the wavelet basis). It would yield the following advantages in principle: * The orthogonality of the wavelets will allow the implementation of an explicit time-stepping in an efficient manner (see <ref> [30] </ref>). * The scalable structure of the wavelet basis allows for easy implementation of multigrid to speed up the computations; this uses the multiscale structure of wavelets (see [12,29]). * High-order Daubechies wavelets induce implicitly high-order finite-difference operators in an automatic fash ion in the wavelet-Galerkin setting (see [2,23]). * Wavelets <p> In particular, in <ref> [30] </ref>, one finds an optimization of the wavelet-Galerkin coding used in inverse scattering problems which has a far superior efficiency compared to earlier codes optimizing over all finite-difference type schemes (which leads in principle to unconditioned stiffness matrices). <p> A very interesting first step for a special case of a wavelet solution of the general viscoelastic problem described above is presented in a recent preprint <ref> [30] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The formulas relating these two representations are given by ([22], see also <ref> [40] </ref>): if we assume an expansion of the form f j (x) = k2Z j;0 j (where f fl;0 fl denotes coefficients of ', and f fl1 fl denotes coefficients of ), f j (x) = k2Z 0;0 j1 X X f k ik (x) 2 V 0 W 0 + <p> The second problem mentioned above concerns an attempt to fashion a multigrid algorithm for an elliptic boundary-value problem with a very general boundary. The papers <ref> [40] </ref>, [39], [13] give a systematic development of single-scale wavelet solutions for model elliptic boundary-value problems for very general boundaries (including both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions).

Reference-contexts: In particular, all energy from light which is emitted in an enclosure is tracked in some manner as it reflects off the various surfaces in the environment, until it dissipates into heat. The paper <ref> [41] </ref> gives a brief review of this model and develops higher-order finite-element solutions of the fundamental integral equation which has the form: B (s; t) = E (s; t) + K (s; t; u; v)B (u; v)dudv; (6:15) where B is a vector-valued function of two variables, where each component of
