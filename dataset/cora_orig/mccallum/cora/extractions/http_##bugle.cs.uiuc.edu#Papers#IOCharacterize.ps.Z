Abstract: Rapid increases in computing and communication performance are exacerbating the long-standing problem of performance-limited input/output. Indeed, for many otherwise scalable parallel applications, input/output is emerging as a major performance bottleneck. The design of scalable input/output systems depends critically on the input/output requirements and access patterns for this emerging class of large-scale parallel applications. However, hard data on the behavior of such applications is just beginning to emerge. In this paper, we describe the input/output requirements of three scalable parallel applications (electron scattering, terrain rendering, and quantum chemistry) on the Intel Paragon XP/S. As part of an ongoing parallel input/output characterization effort, we used instrumented versions of the application codes to capture and analyze input/output volume, request size distributions, and temporal request structure. Because complete traces of individual application input/output requests were captured, in-depth, off-line analyses were possible. In addition, we conducted informal interviews of the application developers to understand the relation between the codes' current and desired input/output structure. The results of our studies show a wide variety of temporal and spatial access patterns, including highly read-intensive and write-intensive phases, extremely large and extremely small request sizes, and both sequential and highly irregular access patterns. We conclude with a discussion of the broad spectrum of access patterns and their profound implications for parallel file caching and prefetching schemes.

Reference-contexts: This data indicates that parallel input/output systems must deliver high performance across broad diversity in application access patterns. Our preliminary experiences with parallel file systems <ref> [6, 7] </ref> suggests that supporting robust performance requires tuning file system policies to specific access patterns. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In x2-3, we summarize our approach to input/output performance characterization and its relation to the new Scalable I/O Initiative. <p> Finally, because the input/output in this application is dominated by small writes, read prefetching would benefit little. In contrast, write request aggregation and write behind could dramatically reduce the output cost. To quantify these effects, we ported the ESCAT code to PPFS, our portable parallel file system <ref> [6] </ref>, and configured the file system with write behind and global request aggregation policies. This combination of policies effectively eliminated the behavior seen in Figure 4. <p> The latter approach is promising, and demonstrations of the effectiveness such approaches are appearing <ref> [6] </ref>. Even for our set of only three application codes, no simple characterization of input/output request sizes or access patterns is viable. Further, studies show that the detailed spatial and temporal characteristics of the input/output critically affect input/output performance. <p> Aggregation is feasible; as an example, the ESCAT code employs multiple writers into disjoint locations in a shared file. Individually, these requests would utilize a disk poorly, however they can be combined, significantly increasing disk efficiency <ref> [6] </ref>. This experience suggests that in some cases, two level buffering at compute nodes and input/output nodes can be beneficial. Characterization studies are by their nature inductive, covering only a small sample of the possibilities and attempting to extract more general patterns. <p> PIOUS [15] is a portable input/output system designed for use with PVM. PASSION [2] supports out-of-core algorithms in a user-level library, but focuses on a high-level array oriented interface. PPFS <ref> [6] </ref> provides user control of file cache sizes and policies, as well as data placement. Similarly, IBM's Vesta parallel file system [3] allows applications to define logical partitions, data distributions, and some access information. <p> Inherent in such an adaptive approach is the need to identify access patterns and choose policies based on access pattern characteristics. As we continue to expand our input/output characterization to a larger suite of codes, we are developing a portable parallel file system <ref> [6] </ref> that allows users to advertize expected file access patterns and to choose file distribution, caching, and prefetch policies. To lessen the cognitive burden of access specification, we have begun developing general, adaptive prefetching methods that can learn to hide input/output latency by automatically classifying and predicting access patterns.

Together these techniques achieve several frames per second on gigabyte data sets, approaching the ten frames per second needed for real-time animation.

Reference-contexts: These applications represent a snapshot of current input/output practice on scalable parallel machines and reflect the developers' input/output design choices based on perceived and actual limitations of available input/output systems. These initial codes are but a small part of the nascent Scalable Input/Output Initiative's (SIO) code suite <ref> [20] </ref>, and our initial characterization is a first step in a continuing input/output characterization effort. <p> These span a broad range of disciplines, including biology, chemistry, earth sciences, engineering, graphics, and physics <ref> [20] </ref>. Despite large differences in their underlying algorithms, the codes share two features. First, each code runs on one or more scalable parallel systems, permitting cross-machine comparisons of input/output performance. Second, all codes have both high input/output and computational requirements. In short, they typify large-scale scientific and engineering computing.
