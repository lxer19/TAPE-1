Abstract: Several architectures have recently been developed which integrate planning, reacting, and knowledge compilation learning, in order to improve system reactivity while retaining system flexibility. This paper assesses strengths and weaknesses of such Plan-Then-Compile architectures, by analyzing one such architecture, Theo-Agent [Mitchell 90]. We describe capabilities and limitations of the Theo-Agent, and use these to try to understand the generic capabilities and limits of Plan Then-Compile architectures more generally.
