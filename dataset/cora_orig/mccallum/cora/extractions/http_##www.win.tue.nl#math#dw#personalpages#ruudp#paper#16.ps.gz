Reference-contexts: Xing (see [12] ) by assuming n &gt; 6g 4 only. However the converse of 1.2 is not always true. For instance, in the same paper [3] a counterexample with g = 1 and n = 4 = 2g + 2 is found. Moreover, as shown in <ref> [8] </ref>, it is possible to get a similar example over F q where q is an even power of 2, with a code arising from an hyperelliptic curve of genus g = 1 2 q 1, and of lenght n = 2g + 2. <p> Furthemore, the converse of Theorem 1.2 is not true for so-called decomposable codes, which we study in the next section. In section 3 we prove the converse of (1.2). Both sections, 2 and 3, are based on the paper <ref> [8] </ref> by C. Munuera and R. Pellikaan.
