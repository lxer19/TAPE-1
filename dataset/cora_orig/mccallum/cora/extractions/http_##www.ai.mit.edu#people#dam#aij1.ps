Abstract: We have argued elsewhere that first order inference can be made more efficient by using non-standard syntax for first order logic. In this paper we define a syntax for first order logic based on the structure of natural language under Montague semantics. We show that, for a certain fairly expressive fragment of this language, satisfiability is polynomial time decidable. The polynomial time decision procedure can be used as a subroutine in general purpose inference systems and seems to be more powerful than analogous procedures based on either classical or taxonomic syntax.

Reference-contexts: The inference procedure presented here is based on a new nonstandard syntax for first order logic which we call a Montagovian syntax. This syntax is based on aspects of natural language syntax under compositional semantics <ref> [1] </ref>, [15], [18], [19], [10], [2]. In particular, our Montagovian syntax is centered around class expressions, i.e., expressions that denote sets. In the earlier taxonomic syntax we allowed for class symbols, such as the symbol a-person, and class expressions such as (brother-of a-person).

Reference-contexts: Nonstandard syntax is essential to both the specification and to the implementation of these procedures. The procedure given in [16] uses a syntax based on taxonomic relations between expressions that denote sets. This procedure can be viewed as an extension of earlier work on knowledge representation languages, e.g., <ref> [3] </ref>, [11], [4], [5]. Knowledge representation languages have traditionally been organized around taxonomic relationships between classes. AI researchers often express the intuition that such taxonomic representations facilitate inference. The technical results in [16] support this intuition.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper presents a new polynomial time procedure for automated inference. Although no polynomial time procedure can be complete for first order logic, polynomial time inference procedures can often be used as powerful subroutines in general purpose reasoning systems <ref> [7] </ref>, [21], [17]. The procedure presented here is a significant strengthening of the procedure presented in [16], which is in turn a significant strengthening of the well known procedure for congruence closure [14], [9].

This paper is intended to provide technical support for the following two somewhat informal claims. 1. The efficiency of inference is sensitive to the syntax used to express statements. 2.
