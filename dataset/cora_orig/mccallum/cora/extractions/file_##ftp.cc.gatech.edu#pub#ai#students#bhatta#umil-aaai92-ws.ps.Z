Abstract: The power of the case-based method comes from the ability to retrieve the "right" case when a new problem is specified. This implies that learning the "right" indices to a case before storing it for potential reuse is crucial for the success of the method. A hierarchical organization of the case memory raises two distinct but related issues in index learning: learning the indexing vocabulary, and learning the right level of generalization. In this paper we show how the use of structure-behavior-function (SBF) models constrains index learning in the context of experience-based design of physical devices. The SBF model of a design provides the functional and causal explanation of how the structure of the design delivers its function. We describe how the SBF model of a design, together with a specification of the task for which the design case might be reused, provides the vocabulary for indexing the design case in memory. We also discuss how the prior design experiences stored in case-memory help to determine the level of index generalization. The KRITIK2 system implements and evaluates the model-based method for learning indices to design cases.

Reference-contexts: Our work is also related to research in explanation-based approach such as explanation-based generalization (EBG) [Mitchell et al., 1986], explanation-based learning (EBL) [DeJong and Mooney, 1986], and explanation-based indexing (EBI) <ref> [Barletta and Mark, 1988] </ref>. Since the SBF models provide an explanation of the functioning of a device, like EBG, EBL and EBI, our approach also uses explanations for solving various tasks. However, our model-based approach differs from the other approaches in the kind of explanations it uses.

Reference-contexts: Then it verifies new design by qualitative simulation of the new SBF model. Finally, KRITIK2 learns indices for the new design case as described in this paper and stores the design for potential reuse. 3 Structure-Behavior-Function Models KRITIK2's SBF models are based on a component-substance ontology <ref> [Bylander and Chandrasekaran, 1985] </ref>. In this ontology, the structure of a device is viewed as constituted of components and substances. Components form the structural topology of the device. Substances are what flow between components with a corresponding rate. Substances have locations in reference to the components in the device. <p> KRI-TIK2's component-substance ontology, structure-behavior-function models, behavioral representation language all are borrowed from KRITIK. The SBF models are based on the component-substance ontology <ref> [Bylander and Chandrasekaran, 1985] </ref> and so is the BRL on the functional representation scheme [Sembugamoorthy and Chandrasekaran, 1986].

Reference-contexts: Further, this design will not be retrieved for those problems where irrelevant properties match, for example, temperature. 6 Related Research Our work on KRITIK2 evolves from our earlier work on KRITIK <ref> [Goel, 1991a; 1991b] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, the output state specifies the properties and the corresponding parameters of the substance at location p4. In addition, the slot by-behavior acts as an index into the causal behavior that achieves the function of cooling sulphuric acid <ref> [Sembugamoorthy and Chandrasekaran, 1986] </ref>. Behavior: The internal causal behaviors of a device are viewed as sequences of state transitions between behavioral states.
