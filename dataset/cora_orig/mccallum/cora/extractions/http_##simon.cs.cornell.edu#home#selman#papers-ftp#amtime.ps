Title: Integrating Metric and Qualitative Temporal Reasoning

Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate how metric and Allen-style constraint networks can be integrated in a constraint-based reasoning system. The highlights of the work include a simple but powerful logical language for expressing both quantitative and qualitative information; translation algorithms between the metric and Allen sublanguages that entail minimal loss of information; and a constraint-propagation procedure for problems expressed in a combination of metric and Allen constraints.

Reference-contexts: So we can treat i L and i R as "variables" in the CSP formulation. (2) Formulas in L M include strict (&lt;) as well as non-strict () inequalities. DMP proved that an all-pairs shortest-path algorithm <ref> [ Aho et al., 1976, page 198 ] </ref> can compute the minimal network representation of a STCSP. One can modify the algorithm to handle the two kinds of inequalities as follows.

Reference-contexts: Such disjointedness constraints form the basis for constraint-based approaches to planning <ref> [ Allen, 1991 ] </ref> . In this paper we demonstrate how metric and qualitative knowledge can be integrated in a constraint-based reasoning system.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm runs in O (n 3 ) time, where n is the number of intervals. Proof: By theorem 2 of <ref> [ Dechter et al., 1989 ] </ref> , any consistent and minimal simple metric network is decomposable. This means that any assignment of values to a set of terms that satisfies the subnet containing those terms can be extended to a satisfying assignment for the entire net.

Reference-contexts: The original presentation of the Allen calculus described the predicates by a set of transitivity axioms such as 8i; j; k : i (M )j ^ j (D)k i (D + S + O)k All of these formulas are theorems of L, rather than axioms <ref> [ Kautz and Ladkin, 1991 ] </ref> . Since L is just first-order logic, we could solve problems that involve both metric and Allen assertions by employing a complete and general inference method, such as resolution. This is almost certain to be imprac-tically slow. <p> In fact, this is its lower bound, as well: we have discovered a class of temporal reasoning problems that shows that the maximum number of iterations does indeed grow with the size of the constraint set <ref> [ Kautz and Ladkin, 1991 ] </ref> . Theorem 4 The algorithm combined-metric-Allen is sound: M [ Aj= L combined-metric-Allen (M; A). <p> So far in our experience with the implemented system the algorithm tends to converge quickly. In fact, if the Allen network is pointisable [ Ladkin and Mad-dux, 1988 ] , we can prove that the algorithm interates no more than two times <ref> [ Kautz and Ladkin, 1991 ] </ref> . The question of whether combined-metric-Allen is a complete inference procedure for the language L M [ L A remains open.

Reference-contexts: In order to develop an inference procedure for this language, let us examine the inference procedures that are known for L M and L A individually. Constraint Networks L M and L A can each express certain binary constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) <ref> [ Montanari, 74 ] </ref> . A binary CSP is simply a set (also called a network) of quantifier-free assertions in some language, each containing two variables.
