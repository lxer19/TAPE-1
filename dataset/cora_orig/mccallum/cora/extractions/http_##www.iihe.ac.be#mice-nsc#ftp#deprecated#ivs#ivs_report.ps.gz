Reference-contexts: Note that the DCT introduces no loss to the source image samples; it merely transforms them to a domain in which they can be more efficiently encoded. Several Fast Cosine Transform algorithms have been described in the literature to compute the series (1) and (2) [13], <ref> [1] </ref>, [5]. In IVS, we use the algorithm presented in [1]. <p> Several Fast Cosine Transform algorithms have been described in the literature to compute the series (1) and (2) [13], <ref> [1] </ref>, [5].

Reference-contexts: UDP is a connectionless transport protocol. It allows users to send messages without connection establishment and without any guarantee of delivery or sequencing. Neither TCP nor UDP is ideal for IVS. UDP lacks reliability guarantees, while TCP has too many. Tests transmitting output data over a standard TCP connection <ref> [6] </ref> allowed us to transmit data over the Internet without concern of the lost packets because of TCP reliability. However, delays generated by retransmission packets and multicast emission led us to use UDP and construct additional reliability services as necessary.

Reference-contexts: The transformation that is usually used is a linear transformation such the Hadamar, Haar, Fourier, Cosine or Wavelet transformation. The optimum is the Karhunen Loeve Transform. The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) approaches the optimum performance for video bandwith compression <ref> [13] </ref>. Transform coding usually works on small blocks of pixels, such as (8 fl 8) or (16 fl 16). * Predictive coding: Here, the next sample is predicted and only the difference between the predicted value and the actual value is quantized. <p> Note that the DCT introduces no loss to the source image samples; it merely transforms them to a domain in which they can be more efficiently encoded.

Reference-contexts: However, delays generated by retransmission packets and multicast emission led us to use UDP and construct additional reliability services as necessary. Request for comments (RFC) 1054 specifies an extension of the Internet Protocol to support multicasting <ref> [15] </ref> which is proposed as standard for IP multicasting in the Internet. IP multicasting consists of transmitting IP datagrams to a host group identified by a single IP destination address.

Reference-contexts: This optimum match is based on the minimization of the distortion between the two blocks <ref> [18] </ref>. The codebook must be processed from the encoder using training pictures, which is the most important processing part of this technique. Then a copy of this codebook must be transmitted to the decoding process.
