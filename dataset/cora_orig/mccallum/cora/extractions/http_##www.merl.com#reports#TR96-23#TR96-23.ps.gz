Abstract: In spite of great advances in the automatic drawing of medium and large graphs, the tools available for drawing small graphs exquisitely (that is, with the aesthetics commonly found in professional publications and presentations) are still very primitive. Commercial tools, e.g., Claris Draw, provide minimal support for aesthetic graph layout. At the other extreme, research prototypes based on constraint methods are overly general for graph drawing. Our system improves on general constraint-based approaches to drawing and layout by supporting only a small set of "macro" constraints that are specifically suited to graph drawing. These constraints are enforced by a generalized spring algorithm. The result is a usable and useful tool for drawing small graphs easily This work may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part for any commercial purpose.

Reference-contexts: In our drawing tool, VOFs can be applied and removed interactively. Furthermore, the tool enforces syntactic constraints, such as preventing nodes overlapping other nodes and edges. The VOF and syntactic constraints are enforced by a generalized spring algorithm, an improved version of the one described by Dengler et al. <ref> [1] </ref>. We describe below how our tool can be used to replicate the drawing in Figure 9 [3].

Reference-contexts: Our system is based on constraints, but ones that are designed specifically for drawing graphs, not general graphics. These "macro" constraints, or Visual Organization Features (VOFs) <ref> [2] </ref>, are listed in Figure 1; the application of each VOF is illustrated by "before" and "after" layouts. In our drawing tool, VOFs can be applied and removed interactively. Furthermore, the tool enforces syntactic constraints, such as preventing nodes overlapping other nodes and edges.
