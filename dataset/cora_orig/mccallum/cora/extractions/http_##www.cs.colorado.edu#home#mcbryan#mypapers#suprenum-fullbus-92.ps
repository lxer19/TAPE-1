Reference-contexts: Those measurements utilized the original 4-ring interconnection topology. We describe here only the changes in performance which have been measured since that time and which are due primarily to the recent rewiring of the SUPRENUM busses to provide both double matrix <ref> (January 1992) </ref> and fully interconnected topologies (also called diagonal topology) (June 1992). <p> We describe here only the changes in performance which have been measured since that time and which are due primarily to the recent rewiring of the SUPRENUM busses to provide both double matrix (January 1992) and fully interconnected topologies (also called diagonal topology) <ref> (June 1992) </ref>.
