Abstract: Colin de Verdiere introduced an interesting linear algebraic invariant (G) of graphs. He proved that (G) 2 if and only if G is outerplanar, and (G) 3 if and only if G is planar. We prove that if the complement of a graph G on n nodes is outerplanar, then (G) n 4, and if it is planar, then (G) n 5. We give a full characterization of maximal planar graphs with (G) = n 5. In the opposite direction we show that if G does not have "twin" nodes, then (G) n 3 implies that the complement of G is outerplanar, and (G) n 4 implies that the complement of G is planar. Our main tools are a geometric formulation of the invariant, and constructing representations of graphs by spheres, related to the classical result of Koebe about representing planar graphs by touching disks. In particular we show that such sphere representations characterize outerplanar and planar graphs.

Reference-contexts: Colin de Verdiere restricted the definition of to connected graphs, but it has been folklore that the definition is meaningful for disconnected graphs as well (see <ref> [7] </ref>), and moreover, the value can be expressed in terms of the connected components: if G is a graph with at least one edge, and C 1 ; : : : ; C r are its connected components, then (G) = maxf (C i ) : 1 i rg: This fact

Reference-contexts: Analogous labellings, with "orthogonal" replaced by "touching", are the subject of a classical result of Koebe <ref> [8] </ref>: Theorem 1.8 The graph G is planar iff its nodes can be labelled by openly disjoint circular disks in the plane, so that two nodes are labelled by touching circles if and only if they are adjacent.

Reference-contexts: Cauchy's theorem implies that it also satisfies (U2). 2 Corollary 8.13 Let H be a 3-connected planar graph with an edge-transitive automorphism group, different from K 4 and K 2;2;2 . Then -(H) = 3. Proof. By a theorem of Mani <ref> [9] </ref>, H can be represented as the 1-skeleton of a convex polytope P , so that the group of congruences acts edge-transitively. We may assume that the center of gravity of P is 0. Let u i denote the vertex of P corresponding to a node i.

Reference-contexts: This rather simple theorem for a connected G takes some work in the general case, cf. section 3. This result links Colin de Verdiere's number with a considerable amount of work done on geometric representations of graphs, cf. <ref> [10, 12, 13] </ref>. Such vector labellings, in turn, will be shown to correspond to labellings of the nodes of graphs by spheres so that adjacent nodes are labelled by orthogonal spheres, and non-adjacent 4 nodes by "less-than-orthogonal" spheres.

Reference-contexts: Then (a) (G) 1 iff G is a path. (b) (G) 2 iff G is outerplanar. (c) (G) 3 iff G is planar. Robertson, Seymour and Thomas, having characterized linkless embeddable graphs by the family of forbidden minors -Y -equivalent to K 6 <ref> [11] </ref>, pointed out that if (G) 4 then G is embeddable in 3-space without linked cycles; recently it has been proved by Lovasz and Schrijver that the converse also holds.
