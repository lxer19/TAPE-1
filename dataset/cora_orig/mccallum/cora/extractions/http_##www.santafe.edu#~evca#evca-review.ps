Abstract: We review recent work done by our group on applying genetic algorithms (GAs) to the design of cellular automata (CAs) that can perform computations requiring global coordination. A GA was used to evolve CAs for two computational tasks: density classification and synchronization. In both cases, the GA discovered rules that gave rise to sophisticated emergent computational strategies. These strategies can be analyzed using a "computational mechanics" framework in which "particles" carry information and interactions between particles effects information processing. This framework can also be used to explain the process by which the strategies were designed by the GA. The work described here is a first step in employing GAs to engineer useful emergent computation in decentralized multi-processor systems. It is also a first step in understanding how an evolutionary process can produce complex systems with sophisticated collective computational abilities.

Reference-contexts: Our selection scheme, in which the top 20% of the rules in the population are copied without modification to the next generation and the bottom 80% are replaced, is similar to the ( + ) selection method used in some evolution strategies <ref> (see Back, Hoffmeister, and Schwefel 1991) </ref>. Selecting parents by relative fitness rank rather than in proportion to absolute fitness helps to prevent initially stronger individuals from too quickly dominating the population and driving the genetic diversity down early.

Reference-contexts: Crutchfield and Hanson have developed a general method for reconstructing the "intrinsic" computation embedded in space-time behavior in terms of "regular domains," "particles," and "particle interactions" (Hanson and Crutchfield, 1992; Crutchfield and Hanson 1993). This method is part of their "computational mechanics" framework for understanding computation in physical systems <ref> (Crutchfield, 1994) </ref>. A detailed discussion of computational mechanics and particle-based computation is beyond the scope of this paper. Very briefly, regular domains are regions of space-time consisting of words in the same regular language|in other words, they are regions that are computationally homogeneous and simple to describe.

Reference-contexts: For example, we have already learned how the GA's breaking of symmetries can lead to suboptimal computational strategies <ref> (Mitchell, Crutchfield, and Hraber 1993) </ref>; eventually we may be able to use such models to test ways in which such symmetry breaking might occur in natural evolution.

Reference-contexts: Our work builds on that of Packard (1988). In preliminary work, we have used a form of the GA to evolve one-dimensional, binary-state r = 3 CAs to perform a density-classification task (Crutchfield and Mitchell 1995; Das, Mitchell, and Crutchfield 1994) and a synchronization task <ref> (Das, Crutchfield, Mitchell, and Hanson 1995) </ref>. For the density classification task, the goal was to find a CA that decides whether or not the IC contains a majority of 1s (i.e., has high density). More precisely, we call this task the " c = 1=2" task.

Reference-contexts: This type of phenomenon, in which a trait starts out being adaptively neutral but is later shaped by evolution to have adaptive value, is known as "exaptation," and is hypothesized by some evolutionary biologists to be an important component of evolution <ref> (e.g., see Gould and Vrba, 1982) </ref>. In generations 13-18 (figure 6c-f),the par strategy described above is approached with increasingly better approximations. For example, in generation 16, the particle forming the 10 most fit CA in each population.

Reference-contexts: We are currently exploring a "coevolution" scheme, in which the IC sample is itself subject to selection and variation by the GA <ref> (cf. Hillis, 1990) </ref>, in order to improve the GA's performance on this problem.

Reference-contexts: This is analogous to the difficulty biologists have in understanding the products of natural evolution. In many cases, particularly in automatic-programming applications <ref> (e.g., genetic programming, Koza 1992) </ref>, it is difficult to understand exactly how an evolved high-fitness individual works.

Reference-contexts: Cellular automata have been studied extensively as mathematical objects, as models of natural systems, and as architectures for fast, reliable parallel computation <ref> (e.g., see Wolfram 1986 for an overview of these various roles) </ref>. One-dimensional binary-state cellular automata 2 are perhaps the simplest examples of decentralized, spatially extended systems in which emergent computation can be studied.
