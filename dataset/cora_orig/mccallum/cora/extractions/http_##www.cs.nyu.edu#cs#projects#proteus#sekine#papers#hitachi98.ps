Reference-contexts: The goal here is to avoid engaging the user at the lower levels of the system, and to keep the interaction as high-level as possible. One example is the system developed at University of Massachusetts at Amherst <ref> (Soderland et al. 95) </ref>, which uses supervised training methods: the system learns patterns from the MUC training 3 Out tool also provides such editing tools. 4 We recognize that in some tasks, filling the template slots will require the implementation of specialized code, which needs to be added to the system,

Reference-contexts: reducing this cost by allowing users who are domain experts to tailor the IE system to new extraction tasks, without the assistance of computational linguists. 6 Acknowledgments This paper is based on a paper previously published in International Workshop on Lexically Driven Information Extraction by Roman Yangar-ber and Ralph Grishman <ref> (Roman and Grishman 97) </ref>. The Japanese Information Extraction system and the Japanese Proteus Extraction Tool is developed based on English systems. The English Pro-teus Information Extraction system was developed by Professor Ralph Grishman, and The English Proteus Extraction Tool was developed by Roman Yangarber.
