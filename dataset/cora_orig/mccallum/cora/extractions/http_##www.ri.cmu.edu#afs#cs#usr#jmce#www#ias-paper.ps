Abstract: This paper describes a scanning laser rangefinder developed for integration with the Carnegie Mellon University autonomous helicopter. The combination of an unmanned, autonomous helicopter with a 3-D scanning laser rangefinder has many potential applications; such as terrain modeling or structure inspection. To achieve high accuracy (10 cm) in each 3-D measurement, careful attention must be paid to minimizing errors, in particular, errors in measuring the direction of the lasers beam. This paper discusses our approach to minimize these errors. Results are presented from early test ights. This paper describes a scanning laser rangefinder developed for integration with the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) autonomous helicopter. The combination of an autonomous, unmanned helicopter with a highly-accurate 3-D perception system has the potential for use in a variety of applications, and provides a platform for further research and development. Much previous work has been done with active sensing of 3-D structure from both aerial and ground vehicles. Lockheed Martin is developing an airplane based mapping system which uses synthetic aperture radar to build digital elevation maps of very large regions. [1] Optech Inc. has own scanning laser rangefinders aboard manned helicopters to map the ocean oor. [2] Many ground vehicles also have utilized laser scanners to scan the regions in front of the vehicle. The systems using aerial vehicles have historically concentrated on generating coarse maps of very large areas. For example, the Lockheed Martin DTEMS is attempting to map the entire U.S. with 3m spacing. In contrast, the ground vehicles can provide highly dense and highly accurate maps, but only of the limited areas which they can access. Additionally, ground vehicles usually must use much more complicated 2-DOF scanning mechanisms which allow an entire area to be imaged. Our interest is in utilizing the advantages of the autonomous helicopter of being precisely controllable and its ability to safely y within close proximity to objects of interest while generating highly dense and highly accurate 3-D models of these objects in possibly remote locations. The CMU autonomous helicopter is a mid-sized, unmanned helicopter capable of fully autonomous takeoff, ight path tracking, accurate (&lt; 20 cm) stationary hover, and landing. [3] These basic capabilities allow the autonomous helicopter to be used as a highly maneuverable sensing platform; allowing access to remote and confined locations without putting human pilots at risk. To realize these capabilities and experiment with their possibilities, we have developed a

Reference-contexts: This reduces the error for this single measurement. This process is repeated until the average error over all of the measurements is no longer reduced by subsequent iterations. This iterative refinement is similar to gradient descent <ref> [5] </ref> in that each measurement applies only a small correction, but after many iterations, the matrix adjusts to a compromised value which typically minimizes the error over all of the measurements.
