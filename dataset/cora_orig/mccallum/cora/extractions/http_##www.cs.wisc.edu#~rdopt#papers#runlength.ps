Abstract: Runlength encoding is used in image and video compression methods to efficiently store quantized DCT coefficients. These coefficients are scanned in a zig-zag fashion, and runs of zeros are entropy coded. We experimented with several images and found that the bit-rate of such a scheme is quite close to the coefficient-wise sum of entropies. In this paper we present a comparison of the two encoding schemes. We also develop an analytical model to characterize the bit-rates.

Reference-contexts: If there is an index n such that C (i) = 0 for all i n, then the symbol eob is produced. This gives a string of symbols from the set possibly followed by the end-of-block symbol eob. This string is then Huffman-coded <ref> [2] </ref> to produce the final code. The code lengths for the symbols (r; v), and the symbol eob, are determined by their frequency of occurrence over all the blocks.
