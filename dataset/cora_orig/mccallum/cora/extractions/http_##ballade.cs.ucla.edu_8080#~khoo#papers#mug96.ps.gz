Reference-contexts: As the driving force weakens along the downstream interconnect structure, it is critical not to overload the driver and narrower wirewidths should be used. In fact, Cong and Leung <ref> [1] </ref> and Sapatnekar [2] have shown that there exists an optimal wiresizing solution (for performance) which is monotone under the Elmore delay model. Despite the above-mentioned advantages, it can be quite difficult to produce a layout according to the complex variable-wirewidth specifications generated by the optimal wiresizing algorithms. <p> wiresizing tool that can deal with the oversizing problem effectively by optimizing both the performance as well as the reliability of the wire segments automatically. 2 Wiresizing Tool 2.1 Performance Optimization The optimal wiresizing solution has, in addition to the monotone property, two other important properties: separability and dominance property <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Since the effect of electromigration increases with temperature, the electromigration current rule must also be adjusted for temperature. The current specification I at the new temperature T can be found from the current I 0 specified at the temperature T 0 by the following <ref> [3, pp. 458] </ref> to ensure a comparable failure rate: I = I 0 e nk ( 1 T 0 ) where n is the current density exponent, a constant value for a given process, E a is the electromigration activation energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and the temperatures T and T
