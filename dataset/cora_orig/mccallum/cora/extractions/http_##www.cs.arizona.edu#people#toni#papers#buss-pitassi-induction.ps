Reference-contexts: Therefore, our lower bound actually shows that Horn-clause resolution as well as bounded-clause-size resolution cannot be simulated by constant degree Nullstellensatz proofs. Other degree lower bounds for Nullstellensatz were known prior to our result, but the hard examples did not separate resolution from Nullstellensatz. For example, in <ref> [1] </ref> it was shown that the pigeonhole principle from m pigeons to n holes requires degree p n Nullstel-lensatz refutations, and in [5], it was shown that the mod p counting principle requires degree n (1) Null-stellensatz refutations over GF q (p; q distinct primes).

Using the same method, one can give Nullstellensatz refutations of any unsatisfi-able Boolean formula (in conjunctive normal form, say), see <ref> [2, 5] </ref>. The size of a Nullstellensatz refutation can be measured in several ways; most notably, by the total number of terms in the refutation or by maximum degree of the polynomials Q j in the refutation. <p> the Nullstellensatz proof system was originally defined as a means to obtaining lower bounds for bounded-depth Frege proofs with parity gates (AC 0 <ref> [2] </ref>-proofs.) It is not too hard to see that small degree Nullstellensatz proofs as well as small degree Grobner proofs can be efficiently simulated by AC 0 [2] proofs. Thus, superpolynomial lower bounds for for AC 0 [2] proofs imply good lower bounds for small degree Grobner proofs. <p> to obtaining lower bounds for bounded-depth Frege proofs with parity gates (AC 0 <ref> [2] </ref>-proofs.)

Reference-contexts: The property (fi) is valid since the choices for l I V satisfy the property of Lemma 10. 2 7 Conclusion The above lower bound shows that resolution proofs cannot be translated into constant degree Nullstellen-satz refutations. Recently, <ref> [7] </ref> have shown that the separation between resolution and Nullstellensatz is even worse. They give another principle, based on strong induction, and prove that it has efficient resolu-tion proofs, but requires linear degree Nullstellensatz refutations. <p> intermediate polynomials of degree at most d, and iteratively obtain the constant 1 by using these intermediate polynomials. (The only difference between Grobner proofs and Nullstellensatz proofs is the degree; any degree d Grobner proof is a Nullstel-lensatz proof, but the degree of the Nullstellensatz proof may be large.) In <ref> [7] </ref>, the Grobner system is introduced, and a deterministic, polynomial-time procedure is given to find small degree Grobner proofs; moreover this algorithm is used to show that tree-like resolution proofs can be efficiently simulated by small-degree Grobner proofs.
