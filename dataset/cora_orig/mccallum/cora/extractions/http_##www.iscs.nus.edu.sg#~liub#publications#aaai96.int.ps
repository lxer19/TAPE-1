Abstract: Rule induction research implicitly assumes that after producing the rules from a dataset, these rules will be used directly by an expert system or a human user. In real-life applications, the situation may not be as simple as that, particularly, when the user of the rules is a human being. The human user almost always has some previous concepts or knowledge about the domain represented by the dataset. Naturally, he/she wishes to know how the new rules compare with his/her existing knowledge. In dynamic domains where the rules may change over time, it is important to know what the changes are. These aspects of research have largely been ignored in the past. With the increasing use of machine learning techniques in practical applications such as data mining, this issue of post analysis of rules warrants greater emphasis and attention. In this paper, we propose a technique to deal with this problem. A system has been implemented to perform the post analysis of classification rules generated by systems such as C4.5. The proposed technique is general and highly interactive. It will be particularly useful in data mining and data analysis. Past research on inductive learning has mostly been focused on techniques for generating concepts or rules from datasets (e.g., Quinlan 1992; Clark & Niblett 1989; Michalski 1980). Limited research has been done on what happens after a set of rules has been induced. It is assumed that these rules will be used directly by an expert system or some human user to infer solutions for specific problems within a given domain. We argue that having obtained a set of rules is not the end of the story. As machine learning techniques are increasingly being used to solve real-life problems, post-analysis of rules will become increasing important. The motivation for performing post-analysis of the rules comes from realizing the fact that using a learning technique on a dataset does not mean that the user knows nothing at all about the domain and the dataset. This is particularly true if the user is a human being. Typically, the human user does have some preconceived notions or knowledge about the learning domain. Hence, when a set of rules is generated from a dataset, naturally he/she would like to know the following: Do the rules represent what I know? If not, which part of my previous knowledge is correct and which part is not? In what ways are the new rules different from my previous knowledge? Past research has assumed that it is the users responsibility to analyze the rules to answer these questions. However, when the number of rules is large, it is very hard for the user to analyze them manually. Besides enabling a user to determine how well the new rules confirm/deny his/her existing concepts and to determine whether the rules have changed over time, post-analysis of rules also helps to deal with a major problem in data mining, i.e., the interestingness problem (Piatesky-Shapiro & Matheus 1994; Piatesky-Shapiro et al 1994). This problem is typically described as follows: In data mining, it is all too easy to generate a huge number of patterns in a database, and most of these patterns (or rules) are actually useless or uninteresting to the user. But due to the huge number of patterns, it is difficult for the user to comprehend them and to identify those patterns that are interesting to him/her. Thus, some techniques are needed to perform this identification task. This paper proposes a fuzzy matching technique to perform the post-analysis of rules. In this technique, existing rules (from previous knowledge) are regarded as fuzzy rules and are represented using fuzzy set theory (Zimmermann 1991). The newly generated rules are matched against the existing fuzzy rules using the fuzzy matching technique. Different algorithms are presented to perform matching according to different criteria. The matched results will then enable us to answer some of the concerns raised above. In this paper, we focus on performing post-analysis of classification rules generated by induction systems, such as C4.5 (Quinlan 1992). This is because classification rule induction is perhaps the most successful machine learning technique used in practice. However, our proposed technique is not bound to classification rules, it is also applicable to other types of

In addition, our approach allows the user to specify his/her beliefs in fuzzy terms which are more natural than complex probabilities that the user has to assign in (Silberschatz & Tuzhilin 1995). 8. Conclusion This paper tries to bridge the gap between the user and the rules produced by an induction system. A fuzzy matching technique is proposed for rule comparison in the context of classification rules.
