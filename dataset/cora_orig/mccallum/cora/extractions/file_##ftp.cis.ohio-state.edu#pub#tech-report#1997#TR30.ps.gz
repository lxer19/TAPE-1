Abstract: Multimedia applications in broadband ISDN present various types and classes of traffic streams, i.e., connections such as audio, video, and file transfers. Output multiplexers at an ATM switching node are responsible for scheduling cells belonging to these traffic connections. A cell loss in a traffic stream due to a cell missing its deadline results in the loss the entire packet that should have been delivered to the destination node. Multicasting is an important application in broadband networks. A cell loss of a multicast stream at an ATM multiplexer not only affects one node, but also it affects a group of nodes in the multicasting group. This packet loss leads to inconsistency in the information received among different members of the multi-cast group. Moreover, if the lost packet can be retransmitted by the root node of the multicast tree, the retransmission will result in an excessive load to the network. In this paper we address the problem of scheduling connections that contain real-time multicasting/non-multicasting and non-real-time traffic. Traffic on real-time connections has a deadline. Each cell has a deadline associated with it (in terms of cell transmission time slots) which the cell has to be scheduled at the multiplexer before it expires. We propose a new scheduling technique that makes use of the information available at multicast connection setup time to give appropriate priority to multicast traffic. In particular we use the multicast tree size (number of nodes) and the multicast subtree sizes at each multiplexer. We show how this information coupled with cell arrival time, can be used to proportionally weigh the actual cell deadline of multicast cells to give them priority over other classes of real-time non-multicast and non-real-time cells. We assume an On-Off traffic source model for real-time connections containing two types of deadlines, tight and relaxed. We compare, through extensive simulation, our technique with two well known real-time scheduling techniques. We show how the new technique outperforms the other techniques by improving cell loss for multicast connections while attempting to maintain the same cell loss or better for non-multicasting connections over a wide range of parameter values. We also show that the new technique does not increase the delay of non-real-time connections compared to the other scheduling techniques. Finally, we discuss how the new technique can be incorporated into an ATM switching node.

Reference-contexts: A non real-time connection has an infinite deadline. 2. Real-Time NonMulticast Connection: Each arriving cell in the stream has a n associated deadline and is routed to exactly one output multiplexer. The cell stream is assumed to follow a classical On-Off traffic source <ref> [1, 19] </ref> as shown in Figure 2. The cell stream for the connection consists of arrivals at fixed intervals T during an active period having a mean a 1 . The number of cells in an active period is geometrically distributed with a mean of (aT ) 1 .

Throughput based 2. Delay based 1.Throughput based: In this category, the capacity of the output link of a multiplexer is partitioned among different types of traffic. Each incoming traffic type (connection) to a multiplexer declares its bandwidth requirements at connection setup time. <p> Local delay: Scheduling of cells at a multiplexer is based on local delay information that is used to give priorities to different traffic classes [14]. Examples of such policies are FCFS, Earliest Due Date First (EDD), and FIFO+ <ref> [6] </ref>. FCFS is the simplest policy since cells are serviced in the order of their arrival regardless of their class. It has the advantages of giving the same low delay to all traffic classes and it efficiently uses the buffer space. <p> End-to-end delay: Scheduling decision made at the multiplexer to service the next cell takes into account some of the end-to-end requirements of each traffic class. Examples of such a category are Transit Priority (TP) and Hop Laxity (HL) <ref> [6] </ref>. In TP, cells that originate at the current multiplexer give way to those cells passing through (called transient) the multiplexing point. The policy tries to increase the probability 4 of aged cells in the network get to their final destination as opossed to those cells just entering the network.

Two such scheduling policies are Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ) [10] and Stop-and-Go queueing <ref> [8] </ref>. WFQ can be viewed as the realization of round robin service policy. Each connection has a dedicated queue and cells are serviced from each queue in cyclic order. The service is modulated by applying weights to determine the rate at which the connection can be served during the cycle.

Reference-contexts: Basically, it is an enhancement to the EDD policy which has readily been implemented <ref> [16] </ref>. The addition of the cell attribute field to the internal cell header in the switch is easy since it is another piece of information similar to the deadline value and cell arrival time. <p> The cell attribute then becomes the addition of this weighted deadline integer value to the current value of the clock at the cell arrival. The implementation of clocks in ATM switches has been discussed in the literature <ref> [16, 4] </ref>. With the above implementation approach, we believe that the MC-EDD technique can be easily and efficiently implemented. 6 Conclusions We presented a new scheduling technique in an ATM multiplexer which considers real-time multicast, real-time non-multicast, and non-real-time traffic.
