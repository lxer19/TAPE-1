Abstract: The sensorimotor integration system can be viewed as an observer attempting to estimate its own state and the state of the environment by integrating multiple sources of information. We describe a computational framework capturing this notion, and some specific models of integration and adaptation that result from it. Psychophysical results from two sensorimotor systems, subserving the integration and adaptation of visuo-auditory maps, and estimation of the state of the hand during arm movements, are presented and analyzed within this framework. These results suggest that: (1) Spatial information from visual and auditory systems is integrated so as to reduce the variance in localization. (2) The effects of a remapping in the relation between visual and auditory space can be predicted from a simple learning rule. (3) The temporal propagation of errors in estimating the hand's state is captured by a linear dynamic observer, providing evidence for the existence of an internal model which simulates the dynamic behavior of the arm.

Reference-contexts: Recently, it has been found that adaptation of the auditory map in the optic tectum can be attributed to changes in one of its inputs, the inferior colliculus <ref> (Brainard & Knudsen 1993) </ref>. Further research needs to be done to determine the signal driving adaptation in the inferior colliculus (cf. the model proposed by Pouget, Deffayet & Sejnowski 1995).

Reference-contexts: It is easy to show that both the WDR and VWDR maintain the minimum variance estimate invariant over time, and converge with the mean estimate given by each modality equal to the minimum variance estimator <ref> (Ghahramani 1995) </ref>. In the case of two modalities, the only difference between the WDR and the VWDR is that the normalization constant in the weights in the WDR has been absorbed into the learning rate of the VWDR. <p> Using a psychophysical paradigm in humans, we have tested some of these predictions for the system involved in localizing visual and auditory targets <ref> (Ghahramani 1995, Ghahramani et al. 1995) </ref>. The basic experimental procedure consisted of measuring the biases (constant errors) and variances in localization of visual (V), auditory (A), and visuo-auditory (VA) stimuli. <p> These results support the variance-weighted delta rule, in which each modality adapts in proportion to its variance, in favor of the other two learning rules. Some asymmetry in adaptation is also observed, which is perhaps related to asymmetries resulting from pointing responses being made using only the right hand <ref> (Ghahramani 1995) </ref>. While these results are suggestive, further experiments are needed to further elucidate the processes of visuo-auditory integration and adaptation. So far, our results strongly argue against models in which senses are integrated stochastically.

Reference-contexts: We view the perceptuomotor system from the point of view of an observer attempting to estimate some relevant attribute of the environment such as the location of a target <ref> (Gibson 1961, Richards 1988, Bennett et al. 1989) </ref>. We test the hypothesis that the observer is integrating multiple information sources so as to minimize the uncertainty in this estimate. There are several ways in which this cost can be defined, which we will explore in section 2.

Reference-contexts: The optimality of Kalman filters can also be stated in several ways. If the noise is Gaussian, the filter provides the maximum likelihood estimator in the sense previously described. However, if the noise is not Gaussian, the Kalman filter still provides the minimum variance linear estimator for the state <ref> (Goodwin & Sin 1984) </ref>. From the point of view of neuroscience, an interesting aspect of the Kalman filter is that it incorporates an internal model of the dynamics of the system being modeled. <p> The Kalman filter makes use of a forward model in order to predict the state of the arm. This motor prediction is then combined with sensory inputs according to the minimum variance integration principle <ref> (Goodwin & Sin 1984) </ref>. To examine the possibility that an internal model is indeed used in sensorimotor integration, we carried out an experiment in which subjects made arm movements in the dark (Wolpert et al. 1995b).

Reference-contexts: two varieties of internal models|"forward models," which mimic the Ghahramani, Wolpert & Jordan Sensorimotor Integration 20 causal flow of a process by predicting its next state given the current state and the motor command, and "inverse models," which are anti-causal, estimating the motor command that causes a particular state transition <ref> (Jordan 1995) </ref>. The Kalman filter makes use of a forward model in order to predict the state of the arm. This motor prediction is then combined with sensory inputs according to the minimum variance integration principle (Goodwin & Sin 1984).

Reference-contexts: We now focus on an extension of the MVE that is particularly relevant to sensorimotor integration. 2.2.1 The Kalman filter. A particularly useful and general form of estimator resulting from the minimum variance integration principle is the Kalman filter <ref> (Kalman & Bucy 1961) </ref>. This extends the framework we have described in two ways.

Reference-contexts: Their results have shown that prismatically perturbing visual inputs, while barely modifying visual localization, induced significant adaptation of auditory localization (Knudsen & Knudsen 1989a, Knudsen & Knudsen 1989b). Furthermore, blind-reared owls developed highly abnormal maps of auditory space in the optic tectum <ref> (Knudsen et al. 1991) </ref>. Our findings are consistent with these results, again suggesting that the registration of visual and auditory maps is largely determined by visual experience.

Reference-contexts: Knudsen and colleagues have extensively studied adaptation to visuo-motor and visuo-auditory displacements and their effects on the neural representations of space in the optic tectum of the barn owl. Their results have shown that prismatically perturbing visual inputs, while barely modifying visual localization, induced significant adaptation of auditory localization <ref> (Knudsen & Knudsen 1989a, Knudsen & Knudsen 1989b) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For example, the specific predictions of the sensorimotor integration model can be tested in both patients with sensory neuropathies, who lack proprioceptive reafference, and in patients with damage to the cerebellum, a proposed site for a forward model <ref> (Miall et al. 1993) </ref>. Here again, the computational model will hopefully provide a reference point for interpreting new behavioral and neurological results.

Reference-contexts: The first observation to note is that visual localization is much less variable than auditory localization (Figure 2a). For both vision and audition, localization is best straight-ahead and increases in variability towards the periphery|a finding that is consistent with the existing literature <ref> (Mills 1958, Middlebrooks & Green 1991) </ref>. The relative variances of visual and auditory localization suggest that vision provides Ghahramani, Wolpert & Jordan Sensorimotor Integration 14 a) b) Optotrak infrared marker mounted on their right index finger, which was used to record the pointing responses.

Reference-contexts: Given a particular cost for integration, one can derive a learning rule for adaptation consistent with that cost. We expand on this in section 2.3 and report on some experiments in section 3. The observer approach has been often used in the study of purely perceptual systems <ref> (e.g. Nakayama & Shimojo 1992) </ref>. One difference between perceptual and sensorimotor systems is that, in the latter, the observer may also need to dynamically integrate reafferent sensory signals and copies of motor efference that arise during movement (Wolpert, Ghahramani & Jordan 1995b).

Reference-contexts: Recently, it has been found that adaptation of the auditory map in the optic tectum can be attributed to changes in one of its inputs, the inferior colliculus (Brainard & Knudsen 1993). Further research needs to be done to determine the signal driving adaptation in the inferior colliculus <ref> (cf. the model proposed by Pouget, Deffayet & Sejnowski 1995) </ref>. Our computational models and experimental results suggest that sensory inputs in an area such as SC may be weighted by a measure of their reliability.

Reference-contexts: The idea of extracting common information from different sensory modalities can be phrased succinctly in the language of information theory. Information is defined as the capacity for a signal to reduce a system's uncertainty (Cover & Thomas 1991). The information content of a source X is defined as <ref> (Shannon 1948) </ref>: H (X) = j=1 where P (X = x j ) is the probability of receiving input x j . (For contin Ghahramani, Wolpert & Jordan Sensorimotor Integration 6 uous signals, a limiting argument is used to convert this sum into an integral.) The information common to two transformed

Reference-contexts: This setting is consistent with independent data that subjects tend to under-reach in pointing tasks, suggesting an overestimation of distance traveled <ref> (Soechting & Flanders 1989) </ref>. All other components of the internal model were set to their veridical values. Simulations of the Kalman filter demonstrated the two distinct phases of bias propagation observed (Figure 6).

Reference-contexts: Under this hypothesis, there are two explanations for the finding that animals often orient to a locus in between visual and auditory stimuli presented simultaneously at different locations <ref> (Stein et al. 1989) </ref>. First, the two distinct loci of activity may merge into one intermediate locus within the collicular map. Second, the actual integration of signals may occur at a later motor stage, whose units have large receptive fields in the collicular map.

Reference-contexts: The superior collicu-lus, and its non-mammalian homologue, the optic tectum, is a layered midbrain structure in which the superficial layers receive visual inputs both directly from the retina and from visual cortex, and the deep layers receive visual, somatosensory, auditory and motor-related inputs <ref> (Wickelgren 1971, Harris et al. 1980, Stein & Meredith 1993) </ref>.

Three experimental conditions were studied, involving the use of null, assis-tive and resistive force fields. Subjects gripped a planar two degree-of-freedom torque-motor-driven manipulandum (Faye 1986), while viewing virtual visual feedback projected into the plane of movement.
