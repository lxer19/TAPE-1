Title: Robotics and the Common Sense Informatic Situation  
Author: Murray Shanahan 
Abstract: This paper proposes a logic-based framework in which a robot constructs a model of the world through an abductive process whereby sensor data is explained by hypothesising the existence, locations, and shapes of objects. Symbols appearing in the resulting explanations acquire meaning through the theory, and yet are grounded by the robots interaction with the world. The proposed framework draws on existing logic-based formalisms for representing action, continuous change, space, and shape.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the set of all explanations of the suggested form for a given stream of sensor data is hard to reason about, and computing a useful representation of such a set is infeasible. This problem is tackled in the full paper by adopting a boundary-based representation of shape (see <ref> [Davis, 1990, Chapter 6] </ref>). Space limitations preclude further discussion of this topic here. CONCLUDING REMARKS A great deal of further work has already been completed, including a treatment of noise via non-determinism and a consistency-based form of abduction [Shanahan, 1996b].

Reference-contexts: Further details of this solution are to be found in [Shanahan, 1996a]. The key to the solution is to put EC outside the scope of the circumscriptions, thus ensuring that the Hanks-McDermott problem is avoided <ref> [Hanks & McDermott, 1987] </ref>. In most cases, the two circumscriptions will yield predicate completions, making the overall formula manageable and intuitive. 3 DOMAIN CONSTRAINTS AND CONTINUOUS CHANGE Two additional features of the calculus are important: the ability to represent domain constraints, and the ability to represent continuous change.

Reference-contexts: Note that the symbol A in (5.7) (or rather its computational counterpart in the actual robot), when generated through the abductive assimilation of sensor data, is grounded in Harnads sense of the term <ref> [Harnad, 1990] </ref>, at the same time as acquiring meaning through the theory.

The formula Releases (a,f,t) says that action a exempts fluent f from the common sense law of inertia. This non - inertial status is revoked as soon as the fluent is initiated or terminated once more.

Reference-contexts: The use of cameras gives rise to a whole set of issues which are beyond the scope of this paper. The central idea of this paper is the assimilation of sensor data through abduction. This is in accordance with the principle, prediction is deduction but explanation is abduction <ref> [Shanahan, 1989] </ref>. To begin with, well be looking at the predictive capabilities of the framework described.

Reference-contexts: r2 In the event calculus, domain constraints are used to determine values for fluents that havent been initiated or terminated by actions or events (non-inertial fluents) given the values of other fluents that have. (Domain constraints that attempt to constrain the relationship between inertial fluents can lead to inconsistency.) Following <ref> [Shanahan, 1990] </ref>, continuous change is represented through the introduction of a new predicate and the addition of an extra axiom. The formula Trajectory (f1,t,f2,d) represents that, if the fluent f1 is initiated at time t, then after a period of time d the fluent f2 holds.

Space is considered a real-valued coordinate system. For present purposes we can take space to be the plane ~ ~ , reflecting the fact that the robot we will consider will move only in two dimensions. A region is a subset of ~ ~. <p> The Displace function is primarily used to describe motion: if an object moves, the region it occupies is displaced. x1,y1 Displace (g,x2,y2) x1x2,y1y2 g (Sp7) The final component of the framework is a means of default reasoning about spatial occupancy <ref> [Shanahan, 1995a] </ref>. Shortly, a theory of continuous motion will be described. This theory insists that, in order for an object to follow a trajectory in space, that trajectory must be clear.

Reference-contexts: It also enables the formal evaluation of algorithms for low-level motor-perception tasks by supplying a formalism in which these tasks can be precisely specified. 2 REPRESENTING ACTION The formalism used in this paper to represent action and change, including continuous change, is adapted from the circumscriptive event calculus presented in <ref> [Shanahan, 1995b] </ref> However, it employs a novel solution to the frame problem, inspired by the work of Kartha and Lifschitz [1995]. The result is a considerable simplification of the formalism in [Shanahan, 1995b]. <p> this paper to represent action and change, including continuous change, is adapted from the circumscriptive event calculus presented in <ref> [Shanahan, 1995b] </ref> However, it employs a novel solution to the frame problem, inspired by the work of Kartha and Lifschitz [1995]. The result is a considerable simplification of the formalism in [Shanahan, 1995b]. Throughout the paper, the language of many-sorted first-order predicate calculus with equality will be used, augmented with circumscription. Variables in formulae begin with lowercase letters and are universally quantified with maximum scope unless indicated otherwise.

Reference-contexts: The present paper assumes perfect motors and perfect sensors. The issue of noise is dealt with in <ref> [Shanahan, 1996b] </ref>. The robot used as an example throughout the rest of the paper is one of the simplest and cheapest commercially available mobile robotic platforms at the time of writing, namely the Rug Warrior described by Jones and Flynn [1993] (Figure 1). <p> Space limitations preclude further discussion of this topic here. CONCLUDING REMARKS A great deal of further work has already been completed, including a treatment of noise via non-determinism and a consistency-based form of abduction <ref> [Shanahan, 1996b] </ref>. This has led to the design of a provably correct algorithm for sensor data assimilation, which forms the basis of a C implementation which has been used in a number of experiments with the robot.
