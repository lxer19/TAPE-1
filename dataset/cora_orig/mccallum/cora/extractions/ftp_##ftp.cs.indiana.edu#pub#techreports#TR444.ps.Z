Title: On the Foundations of Corecursion  
Author: Lawrence S. Moss Norman Danner 
Abstract: We consider foundational questions related to the definition of functions by corecursion. This method is especially suited to functions into the greatest fixed point of some monotone operator, and it is most applicable in the context of non-wellfounded sets. We review the work on the Special Final Coalgebra Theorem of Aczel [NWF] and the Corecursion Theorem of Barwise and Moss [VC]. We prove some results relating the two approaches, and we present a framework from which one can derive the results of both.

Reference-contexts: This is an extension of the more standard universe of wellfounded sets, obtained by adopting the Anti-Foundation Axiom (AFA) in place of the Foundation Axiom. The observation that AFA could give a foundation for corecursions is due to Aczel (see <ref> [NWF] </ref>). Indeed, his work on AFA originated in a study of models of calculi for concurrency where one wants corecursion. <p> This last statement implies (C) and is therefore more abstract. Now what we have in mind for corecursion are statements like (B) and especially (C). In the category-theoretic direction, there are connections of finality with corecursion from <ref> [NWF] </ref> that we review in Section 2.1. Closer to (C), the work of [VC] brings in a conceptual apparatus that also justifies many corecursions. We cover this in Section 2.4. <p> Although the paper can be 2 read without consulting [VC], we have generally omitted the longer proofs which do appear there. Also, those not familiar with non-wellfounded sets would probably need to consult either <ref> [NWF] </ref> or [VC]. Section 3 presents a blend of the two approaches explored earlier in the paper. But is it recursion? When dealing with corecursion, an immediate concern is the extent to which it can be reduced to ordinary recursion. <p> We discuss this in Section 4. However, it is an open question whether such a reduction is possible in every case. 2 Previous work on corecursion In this section, we survey work on corecursion from <ref> [NWF] </ref> and [VC]. Our goals are not to give all the proofs but rather to motivate the whole technical machinery that has been introduced. <p> The assertion about least fixed points is a well-known consequence of definition by recursion on the ordinals. The greatest fixed point result is due to Aczel <ref> [NWF] </ref>. Indeed, there is a nice representation for the class fl : fl = fb j b is a set and b (b)g: (4) Aczel [NWF] also proved basic results relating these fixed points to initial algebras and final coalgebras for certain endofunctors. <p> The greatest fixed point result is due to Aczel <ref> [NWF] </ref>. Indeed, there is a nice representation for the class fl : fl = fb j b is a set and b (b)g: (4) Aczel [NWF] also proved basic results relating these fixed points to initial algebras and final coalgebras for certain endofunctors. To state these, let Class be the category of classes whose morphisms are the set-based operations. <p> We get an algebra for , also denoted fl , by considering ( fl ; i ( fl ; fl )). Similarly, the greatest fixed point fl may be regarded as an algebra or a coalgebra for . Theorem 2.2 (Aczel <ref> [NWF] </ref>) Let be a standard endofunctor on Class. The algebra fl is initial in the category of algebras for . A closely related result appears below in Theorem 3.1. <p> We also want to have "urelements" (called "atoms" in <ref> [NWF] </ref> and elsewhere) in the universe. These are objects which are not sets because they have no elements, but they can belong to sets. <p> As required, c maps into V afa [X]. For any f : A ! A 0 , f (hb; ii) = hb; f ii = [f ffi den]c (hb; ii) This is exactly what we want. Theorem 2.3 (Special Final Coalgebra Theorem <ref> [NWF] </ref>) Assume that is standard and also uniform on maps. The coalgebra fl is final in the category of coalgebras for . We might mention that Aczel calls this result the Special Final Coalgebra Theorem in order to differentiate it from a more general result (see Aczel [NWF] and also Aczel <p> Final Coalgebra Theorem <ref> [NWF] </ref>) Assume that is standard and also uniform on maps. The coalgebra fl is final in the category of coalgebras for . We might mention that Aczel calls this result the Special Final Coalgebra Theorem in order to differentiate it from a more general result (see Aczel [NWF] and also Aczel and Mendler [AM]) on final coalgebras for endofunctors on Class. The general result is stronger since it does not use AFA in its hypotheses, but consequently it does not give a connection to greatest fixed points. <p> This is not a critical point, so we will largely ignore it. We feel that the condition of uniformity on maps in <ref> [NWF] </ref> has an intuitive motivation and at the same time permits one to prove the Special Final Coalgebra Theorem. We prefer to revise the condition to be even more natural, and then later in this paper we will prove a Final Coalgebra Theorem for the new definition.

Our goals are not to give all the proofs but rather to motivate the whole technical machinery that has been introduced. <p> So each state is exactly the transition relation it determines; no isomorphism is needed. For this reason, the states are called canonical. The connection of AFA to the general matter of canonical objects is discussed in <ref> [VC] </ref>. 2.3 Corecursion via the Special Final Coalgebra Theorem We can now return to the discussion of final coalgebras for endofunctors on Class. As we saw above, a result relating greatest fixed points to final coalgebras must involve some condition on the functor. <p> seems to be slightly weaker (we do not know for sure), the latter condition is motivated the same way, holds for all the known examples, and also satisfies a finality theorem for greatest fixed points. 2.4 Corecursion via smooth operators In this section, we review the work on corecursion from <ref> [VC] </ref>. This work differs from the last section in that we forget about categories and work with directly with monotone operators on sets. However, we also need to make assumptions about the operators involved. To grasp the definitions to come, let's return to the corecursion theorem of the previous section. <p> Then for all a 2 A, [s]a = a. For all c 2 b and a 2 A, [s]ha; ci = [s]ffag; fa; cgg = f [s]fag; [s]fa; cgg = ffag; fa; [s]cgg = ha; [s]ci 1 The terminology of very new comes from <ref> [VC] </ref>, where there is also a condition called new for an operator. This weaker notion is obtained by dropping condition (2) from the definition of very newness. <p> A map ' : C ! fl satisfies -corecursion for f relative to den if for all c 2 C, X ffi f (6) Theorem 2.9 (Corecursion Theorem for smooth operators, <ref> [VC] </ref>) Let be a smooth operator, and let f : C ! (C). There is a unique map ' : C ! fl such that ' satisfies -corecursion for f relative to some -notation scheme with range C. <p> There is a unique map ' : C ! fl such that ' satisfies -corecursion for f relative to some -notation scheme with range C. Furthermore, ' satisfies -corecursion for f relative to any -notation scheme with range C. It is argued in <ref> [VC] </ref> that this principle justifies most of the known instances of corecur-sion. There are also extensions of the result to corecursion in parameters and to simultaneous corecursion. We will not detail these here, but we will give an example of how the theorem is used. <p> The method extends to P &lt;! (A [ a), but it is not known how to extend it further to operators like P (A [ a). Their method is based on ordered algebras. In contrast, <ref> [VC] </ref> has a chapter on modal logic, and one can derive an approximation method from that work. In a nutshell, one takes P to be the complete poset of all sentences of infinitary modal logic with A as the set of atomic propositions, ordered by (semantic) implication.

Reference-contexts: It is harder to get an approximation result for operators like a = P (A [ a) or even a = P &lt;! (A [ a). There are two ways to do this. First, <ref> [MMO] </ref> build a dcpo for approximating the hereditarily finite non-wellfounded sets; these are the elements of the greatest fixed point of P &lt;! (a). The method extends to P &lt;! (A [ a), but it is not known how to extend it further to operators like P (A [ a).
