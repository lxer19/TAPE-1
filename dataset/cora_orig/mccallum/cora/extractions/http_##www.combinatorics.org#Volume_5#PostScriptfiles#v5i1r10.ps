Abstract: Using the WZ method, a binomial coefficient identity is proved. This identity is noteworthy since its truth is known to imply a conjecture of Beukers.

Reference-contexts: Theorem. If n is a positive integer, then n X k n 2 k 1 + i=1 i nk X 1 2 i=1 i = 0: Remark. This identity is easily verified using the WZ method, in a generalized form <ref> [Z] </ref> that applies when the summand is a hypergeometric term times a WZ potential function. It holds for all positive n, since it holds for n=1,2,3 (check!), and since the sequence defined by the sum satisfies a certain (homog.) third order linear recurrence equation.
