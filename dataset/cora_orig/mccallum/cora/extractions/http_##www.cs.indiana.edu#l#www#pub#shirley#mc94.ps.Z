Reference-contexts: This implies that: f (~) = 1 if 0 ~ 1 0 otherwise The space over which ~ is defined is simply the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The probability that ~ takes on a value in a certain interval [a; b] is: P rob (a &lt; ~ &lt; b) = a As a two dimensional example, a random variable ff is a uniformly distributed random variable on the disk of radius R. <p> To do this, first choose a random point on the luminaire surface, and then choose a random direction based on the surface normal at that point. Arvo's method can be extended to a radiosity [13] method by letting the Lambertian zones interreflect light <ref> [29, 1, 2, 38] </ref>. This is really just a ray tracing variant of the progressive refinement radiosity method [7]. <p> This approach is almost certainly correct, but its justification and implications have yet to be explained. For example, when evaluating a one dimensional integral on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> we could use a set of N uniformly random sample points (x 1 ; x 2 ; ; x N ) on [0; 1] to get an approximation: Z 1 f (x)dx N i=1 Interestingly, we can replace the points (x 1 ; x 2 ; ; x N <p> This approach is almost certainly correct, but its justification and implications have yet to be explained. For example, when evaluating a one dimensional integral on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> we could use a set of N uniformly random sample points (x 1 ; x 2 ; ; x N ) on [0; 1] to get an approximation: Z 1 f (x)dx N i=1 Interestingly, we can replace the points (x 1 ; x 2 ; ; x N ) with a set of non-random points (y 1 ; y 2 ; ; y N ), and the approximation will still work. <p> More specifics on this can be found in Appendix A. As an example in two dimensions, suppose we want to integrate some function f on the origin centered square <ref> [1; 1] </ref> 2 . <p> Once a w is chosen for filtering, implementation is straightforward provided that w is strictly positive (as it must be if negative pixel colors are disallowed). But how do we choose non-uniform random points? As discussed in Appendix A, sample points can be chosen uniformly from <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 and then a warping transformation can be applied to distribute the points according to w [44, 39, 27]. <p> For several practical and theoretical reasons [37] we have chosen the width 2 weighting function that is non-zero on (x; y) 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref> 2 : w (x; y) = 1 jxj 1 jyj (11) We generate random points with density equal to w by applying a transformation to a uniform random pair (r 1 ; r 2 ) 2 [0; 1] 2 . <p> the width 2 weighting function that is non-zero on (x; y) 2 [1; 1] 2 : w (x; y) = 1 jxj 1 jyj (11) We generate random points with density equal to w by applying a transformation to a uniform random pair (r 1 ; r 2 ) 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 . <p> ) This makes it easy to figure out the color of the ground in the midwest: it's the weighted average of the color of the sky times the reflectance of the ground! 4.4 Multidimensional Quasi-Monte Carlo Integration Suppose we want to numerically estimate the value of an integral I on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 : I = 0 0 f (x; y)dxdy For pure Monte Carlo we might use a set of uniform random points (x i ; y i ) 2 [0; 1] 2 and estimate I to be the average of f (x i ; y i ). <p> ground! 4.4 Multidimensional Quasi-Monte Carlo Integration Suppose we want to numerically estimate the value of an integral I on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 : I = 0 0 f (x; y)dxdy For pure Monte Carlo we might use a set of uniform random points (x i ; y i ) 2 [0; 1] 2 and estimate I to be the average of f (x i ; y i ). <p> Advanced Radiosity 19 If the density is a one dimensional f (x) defined over the interval x 2 [x min ; x max ], then we can generate random numbers ff i that have density f from a set of uniform random numbers ~ i , where ~ i 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. <p> If P is not analytically invertible then numerical methods will suffice because an inverse exists for all valid probability distribution functions. For example, to choose random points x i that have the density p (x) = 3x 2 =2 on <ref> [1; 1] </ref>, we see that P (x) = (x 3 + 1)=2, and P 1 (x) = 3 p 2x 1, so we can warp a set of canonical random numbers (~ 1 ; ; ~ N ) to the properly distributed numbers (x 1 ; ; x N ) =

Reference-contexts: If photons are retained as an aspect of the model, then an obvious analog process is one where photons whose wavelengths are outside of the region of spectral sensitivity of the film do not exist. Several researchers (e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>) have used Monte Carlo simulation of a simple analog of optics, where only Lambertian and specular surfaces are used. A lambertian surface is one with several simple properties. First, its radiance at any wavelength does not vary with viewing angle. <p> Note that d is the reflectance, not the BRDF, of the surface. The BRDF is the reflectance divided by . As an example of an analog process, the illumination ray tracing of Arvo <ref> [3] </ref> assumed photons traveled as bundles with a spectral distribution. He further assumed that these bundles were attenuated when reflecting from a specular surface.

Reference-contexts: The reflectivity term is simply: R (x; ) = incoming 0 bd (x; ; 0 ) cos d! For an ideal specular surface, the ~ will always be the ideal reflection direction. For a dielectric, ~ can be chosen randomly between reflected and transmitted directions <ref> [4] </ref>, or it can be split into two integrals as is done in a Whitted-style ray tracer [55]. For a diffuse surface, ~ will follow a cosine distribution: p ( 0 ) = cos =. When Equation 13 is used, the sampling takes place over all surfaces in the environment. <p> A good example of this combined strategy is Ward's Radiance program described in the conference procedings [53]. When designing new Monte Carlo methods, we usually think in terms of variance reduction. Work by Arvo and Kirk <ref> [4, 23] </ref> has detailed that this can be a non-trivial and sometimes counter intuitive process. To add to the confusion, we usually use quasi-random sampling, so the variance calculations are only an approximation.

This is really just a ray tracing variant of the progressive refinement radiosity method <ref> [7] </ref>. In this method, reflectance ( d;i ) and emitted power (F e;i ) of the ith zone are known, and the reflected power (F r;i ) (F r;i = d F incoming;i ) is unknown. <p> Earlier versions of this document said that absorb and reemit was asymptotically equivalent to the photon tracking model. 8 Hybrid Radiosity/Monte Carlo Methods iteration (each ray carries approximately the same amount of power).

Reference-contexts: Once the total power of each patch is found, it can be converted to radiance using Equation 4. These radiance values can then be interpolated to form a smooth appearance <ref> [8] </ref>. We first set our estimate of F i to be F e;i for all i. For each surface i that has non-zero F e;i , we can shoot a set of n i energy packets each carrying a power of F e i =n i .

Reference-contexts: In method 3, a zonal solution is carried out on a low-resolution version of the scene, and this is used as sources for gather phases at each pixel [34, 33, 26]. This in some sense is a generalization of the patch and elements approach <ref> [9] </ref>. The application of this technique and brute-force path tracing [22] is shown in Figure 11. The Rushmeier method ran eight times faster because it did not have to recursively fire rays. On complex scenes this advantage will only grow. Currently I am using method 3 exclusively.

Reference-contexts: from stratified sampling because the variance in each subcell will usually be smaller than the variance of the entire domain. 4.1 Quasi-Monte Carlo Integration Although distribution ray tracing is usually phrased as an application of Equation 6, many researchers replace the ~ i with more evenly distributed (quasi-random) samples (e.g. <ref> [10, 30] </ref>). This approach can be shown to be sound by analyzing decreasing error in terms of some discrepancy measure [58, 56, 30, 39] rather than in terms of variance. <p> When Equation 13 is used, the sampling takes place over all surfaces in the environment. In practice, only the direct lighting is calculated, so the integration space becomes all luminaire surfaces. This can be split into one integral for each surface <ref> [10] </ref>, or can be viewed as a single sampling space [27, 43]. To simplify this discussion, we will assume only one luminaire, so the sampling space is just a single surface.

Reference-contexts: is taken in each S i (with density p i ), and in this case the variance of the estimate is: var N X g (x i ) ! N X var g (x i ) The most common example of stratified sampling in graphics is jittering for pixel sampling <ref> [11] </ref>. <p> In practice, this isn't practical because the geometry term g and the BRDF bd can be very difficult to characterize. Instead, many researchers <ref> [11, 22] </ref> sample uniformly within the solid angle subtended by the luminaire, which yields: p (x 0 ) = C 0 cos 0 Even this must only be approximated for polygonal luminaires [52], but can be exactly applied for spherical luminaires [24, 52].

Reference-contexts: An natural choice for tracking the power is to use ray tracing. However, it is not so obvious how many rays to send, or where to send them. This question has been examined in a fairly sophisticated way in <ref> [17] </ref>, but even for a simple implementation the answer is non-obvious. The number of rays that must be sent is enough. This depends on how much noise is acceptable in an image, and how small the zones are.

This approach can be shown to be sound by analyzing decreasing error in terms of some discrepancy measure [58, 56, 30, 39] rather than in terms of variance. <p> This approach can be shown to be sound by analyzing decreasing error in terms of some discrepancy measure <ref> [58, 56, 30, 39] </ref> rather than in terms of variance.

Even if radiosity is used, it can often be used only for the indirect component and the direct component can be done using the machinery of this section.

A more detailed discussion of the implementation of Monte Carlo radiosity can be found in <ref> [40] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The number of rays that must be sent is enough. This depends on how much noise is acceptable in an image, and how small the zones are. In <ref> [41] </ref> it is argued that the number of rays should be linearly proportional to the number of zones, so doubling the number of zones implies that the number of rays should also be doubled. <p> The other is that, unlike in [7], the zone with the most power is not searched for, or the time complexity of the method will increase from O (N log N ) to O (N 2 ), where N is the number of zones <ref> [41] </ref>.
