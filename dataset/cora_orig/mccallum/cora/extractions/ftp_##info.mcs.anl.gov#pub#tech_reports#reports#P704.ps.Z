Reference-contexts: Suppose too that we disallow short selling (which is the practice of selling a stock that you don't currently hold, in the hope of buying it some time later at a lower price). Under these assumptions, the value of w i must lie in the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, with P n i=1 w i = 1. <p> We may also want to include transaction costs in the objective function, or to impose a minimum balance on any securities that are included in the final portfolio. Some of these requirements increase the complexity of the problem considerably (see Bienstock <ref> [1] </ref>) and, in particular, may necessitate the use of integer programming algorithms. 30 stocks as possible investments|all except Philip Morris|and set the bond interest rate to 5.0% and the risk tolerance parameter to 15. The optimal portfolio is quite conservative; it suggests 43% of assets in bonds.

Reference-contexts: Any optimization problem with a linear objective and linear constraints (linear inequality constraints, linear equality constraints, bounds) can be reformulated equivalently as a standard-form problem by a series of simple algebraic manipulations, including the insertion of "slack" and "surplus" variables. Texts on linear programming abound; see, for example, Chvatal <ref> [2] </ref>. NEOS GUIDE CASE STUDIES 3 In the diet problem, the variable x i represents the number of servings of food i to be eaten in a single day. The corresponding cost vector component c i represents the cost per serving of food i. <p> The main window illustrates current values of the basis components, basis matrix, multipliers, reduced costs, and so on; see Figure 2. For information about the simplex algorithm, follow the pointers from the Simplex Applet web page, or consult one of the many texts in the area (for example, Chvatal <ref> [2] </ref>). 3. The Portfolio Optimization Problem. <p> In fact, it is an integer linear program: All components of the solution are required to be integers. An excellent description of the problem and its history is given by Chvatal <ref> [2, Chapter 13] </ref>; we present just a brief summary here. <p> In other words, we look for the mix of slicing patterns, and the number of times each pattern is applied, that minimizes the total number of raws used. We describe the problem by studying the following specific example from <ref> [2] </ref>. Suppose that the raws are 110 inches wide and that four orders for finals of different widths have been received. The quantities of each width are shown in Table 1. <p> We respond by adding this column z to the matrix A (thereby increasing the dimension of the of the reduced problem by 1), and then repeat the process of solving (15) followed by (17). The knapsack problem (17) can be solved by a specialized branch-and-bound procedure; see Chvatal <ref> [2] </ref> for details. The final step in the process is to add the integrality constraints (13b) to the solution of the the continuous problem (13a) that arises from the column generation procedure.

Reference-contexts: In some cases, we display the formulation explicitly in terms of AMPL, a mathematical modeling language specifically tailored to optimization problems which can serve as an interface to many different software packages (see Fourer, Gay, and Kernighan <ref> [5] </ref>). Next, there is a menu or table that allows the users to interact with the case study, for example, by indicating the foods they are prepared to eat (in the case of the diet problem) or by defining their risk tolerance (in the case of portfolio optimization).

Reference-contexts: It seems wasteful, then, to go to the trouble of actually figuring out all the different patterns, since such a small proportion of them have any impact on the solution. In fact, it is not necessary to do so. The column generation approach, due to Gilmore and Gomory <ref> [6, 7] </ref>, does a good job of identifying the "useful" patterns|the ones most likely to contribute to the solution|while verifying that all the patterns not explicitly calculated are not relevant to the solution. We include a brief description of column generation in the subsection that follows.

Reference-contexts: They were first formulated quantitatively in 1952 by Markowitz <ref> [8] </ref>, also known to computational mathematicians as the inventor of the Markowitz pivot criterion for sparse matrix factorization.

Reference-contexts: Classification by problem area makes it easier for users to find the codes with just the right combination of capabilities that they need. (The material in the Software Guide was originally drawn from the 1993 book of More and Wright <ref> [11] </ref>, but has been augmented and enhanced.) Another NEOS Guide feature, the Optimization Tree, contains thumbnail sketches of different areas of optimization.

Reference-contexts: By definition, the matrix Q in (10) is positive semidefinite and the feasible region is bounded, so the problem certainly has a solution, though not necessarily a uniquely defined one. For additional information on portfolio optimization, see the books by Markowitz [9, 10] and the article by Perold <ref> [12] </ref>. A number of enhancements to the basic problem (10) have been proposed by various researchers and practitioners. For one thing, constraints on the allocation vector may be desirable; we may want to limit our exposure to technology stocks to 25% of our portfolio, for example.
