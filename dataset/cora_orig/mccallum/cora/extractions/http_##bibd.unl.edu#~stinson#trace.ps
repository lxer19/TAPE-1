Reference-contexts: In this paper, we investigate traceability schemes in which the personal keys can be assigned before the authorized users are determined. We will call these schemes key preassigned schemes. Key preassigned schemes (for broadcast encryption) have been discussed by several researchers. The first scheme was introduced by Berkovits in <ref> [1] </ref>. Several recent papers have studied broadcast encryption schemes (see [2, 3, 6, 9, 11, 12], for example). Broadcast schemes enable a TA to broadcast a message to the users in a network so that a certain specified subset of authorized users can decrypt it. <p> K P can be computed by any member of P , but K P cannot be computed by any forbidden subset F disjoint from P (where jF j f ). 5 3 Traceability of previous broadcast schemes Since key preassigned broadcast encryption schemes were proposed in <ref> [1] </ref>, several constructions have been given. A summary of these results can be found in Stinson [11]. In [11], the KIO construction is described, and which is further discussed in [12].

Reference-contexts: 82 blocks, where the calculations are in Z 41 , for i = 0; 1; 2; ; 40: A i = f1 + i; 10 + i; 18 + i; 16 + i; 37 + ig The set system (X; A) is a (41; 5; 1)-balanced incomplete block design (see <ref> [4] </ref>). This set system has the property that each pair of points appears in exactly one block, and every point appears in exactly 10 blocks. It is in fact a (2; 5)-TSS (see Theorem 5.3). The block A i is associated with user i. <p> Some constructions for these types of set systems were given in [13]; they are based on certain types of combinatorial designs. (A comprehensive source for information on combinatorial designs is Colbourn and Dinitz <ref> [4] </ref>.) We present a useful lemma for constructing TSS, and mention some applications of it. 10 Lemma 5.1 Suppose there exists a set system (X; A) satisfying the following conditions: 1. jAj = k c 2 + 1 for any A 2 A; Then the set system is a (c; k)-TSS. <p> Any two blocks of a t-(v; k; 1) design intersect in at most t 1 points. Apply Lemma 5.1 with = t 1. There are many results on t-(v; k; 1) designs for small values of t, i.e., for 2 t 6. See <ref> [4] </ref> for a summary of known results. We can construct interesting TSS using designs with t = 2. For example, it is known that there is a 2-(v; 5; 1) design for all v 5, v 1; 5 mod 20.

Reference-contexts: Some unauthorized users might obtain some decryption keys from a group of one or more authorized users (called traitors). Then the unauthorized users can decrypt data that they are not entitled to. To prevent this, Chor, Fiat and Naor <ref> [5] </ref> devised a traitor tracing scheme, called a traceability scheme, which will reveal at least one traitor on the confiscation of a pirate decoder. This scheme was then generalized by Stinson and Wei in [13]. There are some other recent papers discussing this topic (see [7, 8, 9]). <p> In all the traceability schemes discussed in <ref> [5, 13, 7, 8] </ref> it is assumed that every user can decrypt the enabling block. This means that the data supplier should assign the keys after he or she has determined who the authorized users are. <p> Thus the OR protocol has no traceability if we consider the traceability under Definition 2.1, where we allow a pirate decoder to have fewer keys than a personal key. The traceability schemes in <ref> [5, 13] </ref> have the desirable property that any possible decoder must consist of the keys from the base key set, otherwise they will be useless for decoding. In some other proposed schemes, an enabling block can be decrypted using keys not in 6 the base set. <p> The con structions are similar to those found in [12, 13]. 6 Some remarks We make a couple of final observations in this section. * The (c; f )-KPTS scheme discussed in this paper is a generalization of the traceability schemes in <ref> [5, 13] </ref>. The schemes in [5, 13] are in fact the case of f = 0 of our main construction. <p> The con structions are similar to those found in [12, 13]. 6 Some remarks We make a couple of final observations in this section. * The (c; f )-KPTS scheme discussed in this paper is a generalization of the traceability schemes in <ref> [5, 13] </ref>. The schemes in [5, 13] are in fact the case of f = 0 of our main construction. When f = 0, there is no protection against an unauthorized user decrypting the enabling block. * Most broadcast schemes and traceability schemes in the literature are described as unconditionally secure schemes.

However, most of these broadcast schemes have not considered the question of traceability. <p> For the case f = 1, we denote the scheme as a c-KPTS. Remark. The difference between Definition 2.1 and the one in <ref> [9] </ref> is that the size of the pirate decoder is not specified here. For example, the pirate decoder might be smaller or larger than a legitimate decoder. The only requirement is that a pirate decoder should be able to decode some enabling blocks. <p> Thus the trivial scheme in [11] has b-traceability.) Staddon first discussed the traceability of key preassigned broadcast schemes in her PhD thesis <ref> [9] </ref>. She constructed some schemes called "OR protocols" that have higher traceability. We briefly review the OR protocols now. In OR protocols, the size of a forbidden subset is f and the size of the privileged subset is w = b f . These values are fixed ahead of time. <p> It is shown in <ref> [9] </ref> that the OR protocol construction has fi ( p n)-traceability for n &gt; 2 and b sufficiently large relative to n and f .

As in a traceability scheme, there is a trusted authority (TA) and a set of users U = f1; 2; ; bg, and the TA generates a set of v base keys and assigns a subset of the base keys to each user as his or her personal key. <p> share is an element of F q and the secret is also an element of F q , for any prime power q b + 1. 2.4 Key predistribution schemes Fiat-Naor key predistribution schemes (or KPS) (see [6]) are used in the KIO construction for broadcast encryption schemes given in <ref> [11] </ref>. Let f b be an integer. The forbidden subsets consist of all subsets of size at most f . In a Fiat-Naor scheme, the TA chooses a secret value x F for each possible forbidden subset F , and gives that value to each user in U nF . <p> A summary of these results can be found in Stinson <ref> [11] </ref>.
