Abstract: The empirical study described in this paper addresses the issue of communication among members of a software development organization. The independent variables are various attributes of organizational structure. The dependent variable is the effort spent on sharing information which is required by the software development process in use. The research questions upon which the study is based ask whether or not these attributes of organizational structure have an effect on the amount of communication effort expended. In addition, there are a number of blocking variables which have been identified. These are used to account for factors other than organizational structure which may have an effect on communication effort. The study uses both quantitative and qualitative methods for data collection and analysis. These methods include participant observation, structured interviews, and graphical data presentation. The results of this study indicate that several attributes of organizational structure do affect communication effort, but not in a simple, straightforward way. In particular, the distances between communicators in the reporting structure of the organization, as well as in the physical layout of offices, affects how quickly they can share needed information, especially during meetings. These results provide a better understanding of how organizational structure helps or hinders Software development managers strive to control all of the factors that might impact the success of their projects. However, the state of the art is such that not all of these factors have been identified, much less understood well enough to be controlled, predicted, or manipulated. One factor that has been identified [Curtis88] but is still not well understood is information flow. It is clear that information flow impacts productivity (because developers spend time communicating) as well as quality (because developers need information from each other in order to carry out their tasks well). The study described in this paper addresses the productivity aspects of communication by empirically studying the organizational and process characteristics which influence the amount of effort software developers spend in communication activities. This is a first step towards providing management support for control of communication effort. This research also arises out of an interest in the organizational structure of software enterprises and how it affects the way software is developed. Development processes affect, and are affected by, the organizational structure in which they are executed. communication in software development.

Reference-contexts: The types of relationships upon which these measures are based are, respectively, official relationships, physical proximity, and past and present working relationships. The study combines quantitative and qualitative research methods. Qualitative methods are designed to make sense of data represented as words and pictures, not numbers <ref> [Gilgun92] </ref>. Qualitative methods are especially useful when no well-grounded theories or hypotheses have previously been put forth in an area of study. Quantitative methods are generally targeted towards numerical results, and are often used to confirm or test previously formulated hypotheses. <p> An interaction begins when some party requests information (or when a party begins preparation of unrequested information) and ends after the information has been received and understood sufficiently for it to be used (e.g. read). qualitative data - data represented as words and pictures, not numbers <ref> [Gilgun92] </ref>. Qualitative analysis consists of methods designed to make sense of qualitative data. quantitative data - data represented as numbers or discrete categories which can be directly mapped onto a numeric scale.

Data collection and analysis methods have come directly from the literature in empirical methods <ref> [Lincoln85, Taylor84] </ref>. Despite the considerable support in the literature, there are several significant issues which are not addressed there. Probably the most important is that of intervening, or blocking, variables. <p> Examples of this practice are found in [Sandelowski92, Schilit82, Schneider85]. 6 The data collection procedures used in this study are participant observation [Taylor84] and structured interviews <ref> [Lincoln85] </ref>.

As described later, the data gathered from these different sources overlaps, thus providing a way of triangulating [Lincoln85], or cross-checking the accuracy of the data. After the data was collected, it was coded in such a way that the result is a set of data points, each of which has a set of values corresponding to a set of quantitative research variables. <p> The data collection procedures included gathering of official documents, participant observation [Taylor84], and structured interviews <ref> [Lincoln85] </ref>. The observations and interviews were guided by a number of forms, or instruments. All of these procedures and instruments are discussed in the following sections. <p> Documents The official documents of an organization are valuable sources of information because they are relatively available, stable, rich, and nonreactive, at least in comparison to human data sources <ref> [Lincoln85] </ref>. The model of the DB2 environment (described in section 3.3) relied initially on two confidential IBM documents, a review process document and the official organization chart. Other documents which provided data later were copies of the Review Summary Forms for each review that was observed. <p> Finally, a small amount of time in each review was spent in administrative tasks (A), for example connecting with remote Reviewers via phone. Totals for these various categories of time were recorded on the observation checklist. 3.4.3. Interviews In <ref> [Lincoln85] </ref>, a structured, or "focused", interview is described as one in which "the questions are in the hands of the interviewer and the response rests with the interviewee", as opposed to an unstructured interview in which the interviewee is the source of both questions and answers. <p> As well, no reliability techniques were employed, such as audio or videotaping the reviews, or having a second observer. This would have ensured better accuracy of the data. Also related to data accuracy, there were some variables that had no triangulation <ref> [Lincoln85] </ref> source. That is, there was only one data source for these variables. It would be better, and should be possible, to have at least two sources for each piece of information collected.

Reference-contexts: Observations Participant observation, as defined in [Taylor84], refers to "research that involves social interaction between the researcher and informants in the milieu of the latter, during which data are systematically and unobtrusively collected." Examples of studies based on participant observation are found in <ref> [Barley90, Perry94, Sandelowski92, Sullivan85] </ref>. In these examples, observations were conducted in the subjects' workplaces, homes, and therapists' offices. The idea, in all these cases, was to capture firsthand behaviors and interactions that might not be noticed otherwise.

Data collection and analysis methods have come directly from the literature in empirical methods <ref> [Lincoln85, Taylor84] </ref>. Despite the considerable support in the literature, there are several significant issues which are not addressed there. Probably the most important is that of intervening, or blocking, variables. <p> Examples of this practice are found in [Sandelowski92, Schilit82, Schneider85]. 6 The data collection procedures used in this study are participant observation <ref> [Taylor84] </ref> and structured interviews [Lincoln85]. Development documents from the environments under study also provide some of the data [Lincoln85]. As described later, the data gathered from these different sources overlaps, thus providing a way of triangulating [Lincoln85], or cross-checking the accuracy of the data. <p> Data Collection The data for this study were collected during an initial visit to IBM in Toronto in June 1994, two follow-up visits in November 1994 and April 1995, and several email communications in between the visits. The data collection procedures included gathering of official documents, participant observation <ref> [Taylor84] </ref>, and structured interviews [Lincoln85]. The observations and interviews were guided by a number of forms, or instruments. All of these procedures and instruments are discussed in the following sections. <p> Most of the information on these forms had already been collected during the observations of the reviews, so the forms served as a validation (triangulation) instrument. 3.4.2. Observations Participant observation, as defined in <ref> [Taylor84] </ref>, refers to "research that involves social interaction between the researcher and informants in the milieu of the latter, during which data are systematically and unobtrusively collected." Examples of studies based on participant observation are found in [Barley90, Perry94, Sandelowski92, Sullivan85]. <p> The interviews also served to clarify some interactions that went on during the meeting, and to triangulate data that had been collected during the meeting. Before each interview, the interviewer constructed an interview form, or guide <ref> [Taylor84] </ref>, which included questions meant to elicit the information sought in that interview. These forms were not shown to the interviewee, but were used as a guide and for recording answers and comments. Figure 5 shows an example of such a guide.
