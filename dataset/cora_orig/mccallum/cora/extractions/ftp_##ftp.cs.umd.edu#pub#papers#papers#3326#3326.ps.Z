Abstract: Navigation can be studied in a graph-structured framework in which the navigating agent (which we shall assume to be a point robot) moves from node to node of a "graph space". The robot can locate itself by the presence of distinctively labeled "landmark" nodes in the graph space. For a robot navigating in Euclidean space, visual detection of a distinctive landmark provides information about the direction to the landmark, and allows the robot to determine its position by triangulation. On a graph, however, there is neither the concept of direction nor that of visibility. Instead, we shall assume that a robot navigating on a graph can sense the distances to a set of landmarks. Evidently, if the robot knows its distances to a sufficiently large set of landmarks, its position on the graph is uniquely determined. This suggests the following problem: given a graph, what are the fewest number of landmarks needed, and where should they be located, so that the distances to the landmarks uniquely determine the robot's position on the graph? This is actually a classical problem about metric spaces. A minimum set of landmarks which uniquely determine the robot's position is called a "metric basis", and the minimum number of landmarks is called the "metric dimension" of the graph. In this paper we present some results about this problem. Our main new result is that the metric dimension can be approximated in polynomial time within a factor of O(log n); we also establish some properties of graphs with metric dimension 2.

Reference-contexts: We then consider graphs having small metric dimension, and show that a graph has metric dimension 1 iff it is a path. Garey and Johnson (unpublished result, cited in <ref> [1] </ref>) proved that the problem of finding the metric dimension of a general graph is NP-complete by a reduction from 3-dimensional matching. For completeness, we provide in the appendix a reduction from 3-SAT. <p> Thanks also to Christine Piatko for faxing me a copy of [2], and to David Johnson for faxing us the NP-completeness proof cited in <ref> [1] </ref>.

Related Work: The problem of finding the metric dimension of a graph was first studied by Harary and Melter <ref> [2] </ref>.

We now prove that the metric dimension of T , fi (T ), is exactly X ` v 1: The characterization obtained by Harary and Melter <ref> [2] </ref> is essentially the same, with a different proof. We first obtain a lower bound on fi (T ). Lemma 2.1 Let T = (V; E) be a tree which is not a path.
