Abstract: The task of Quality-of-Service (QoS) routing is to find a path in the network that satisfies certain constraints on metrics such as bandwidth, delay, delay jitter and cost. Most previous work on routing does not support guaranteed quality of service, which makes this area relatively new. All recently-published QoS routing algorithms consider one or two specific metrics and most of them require the maintenance of a global network state at each node. We propose a family of distributed routing algorithms which require every node to maintain only its local state. The algorithms use a distributed computation to collectively utilize the most up-to-date local information at each node to find a path. The found path is guaranteed to be loop-free. All the algorithms are uniformized into the same framework. A generic algorithm is proposed as the common basis for developing concrete routing algorithms on specific metrics.

Reference-contexts: We study the average overhead of our DRAs by simulation. The program was written in MODSIM III, a programming language that supports concurrent-event simulation. Two network topologies, NET-1 (Figure 3) and NET-2 (Figure 4), were used in the simulation. NET-1 is based on the major circuits in ANSNET <ref> [4] </ref> and NET-2 increases the connectivity of NET-1 by additional links. Each link is full duplex with a bandwidth capacity of 155Mbps (OC3).

Reference-contexts: The Tenet's dynamic resource management scheme [13] provides source routing by using a modified version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, which finds a delay-bounded path with the least hops. The delay-constrained least-cost (DCLC) routing problem, i.e., finding a delay-bounded path with the minimum cost, is NP-complete <ref> [5] </ref>. A centralized algorithm was reported by Widyono [19] which solves the DCLC problem with an exponential time complexity. Salama et al [15] proposed a distributed algorithm as a heuristic solution to the DCLC problem. Sun and Langendorfer [16] improved the worst-case performance of the Salama's algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Too small periods lead to high overhead and too large periods result in outdated state information. Plotkin [14] presented a competitive strategy that unifies routing and admission control for general-topology networks. Their distributed implementation approach <ref> [6] </ref> does not require every node to periodically update the global state. However, only bandwidth is considered in their model. All existing algorithms consider one or two specific metrics and none of them provides a general routing framework so that new metrics can be easily added into the framework.

Reference-contexts: A difficult problem is how to keep the global state up-to-date.

While the two algorithms work well in non-Qos networks, they have some disadvantages for QoS 2 networks, especially those whose traffic volume and pattern change rapidly.

Reference-contexts: Different metrics may change at different rates. For examples, the topology changes less frequently than the available bandwidth of each communication link. Too small periods lead to high overhead and too large periods result in outdated state information.

Multiple-metric-constrained routing is studied. The problem of finding a path subject to constraints on two or more additive metrics (e.g. delay and delay jitter) is NP-complete <ref> [17] </ref>. We propose a heuristic algorithm for this problem. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The computation model is given in Section 2. A 3 family of distributed routing algorithms are proposed in Section 3. Experiment results are shown in Section 4. <p> The purpose of routing is to find a path P which satisfies 8i 2 [1::n]; m i (P ) R M i where R is &lt;; ; &gt; or .
