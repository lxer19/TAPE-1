Title: Towards An Adaptive Framework for Information Retrieval  
Author: Scott A. Weiss Simon Kasif Eric Brill fweiss, kasif, 
Date: October 31, 1995  
Affiliation: Dept. of Computer Science The Johns Hopkins University  
Abstract: We report on our investigation into techniques for adaptive information retrieval. We describe our domain of USENET newsgroups, and discuss some of our inital experiments. We illustrate the weakness of naive approaches, give evidence based on human subjects to show there is room for improvement, and present some simple ideas that give better performance.

Reference-contexts: 1 A Domain for Adaptive IR As the heralded "information superhighway" continues to expand, the need for useful methods of navigating it becomes greater. There are already a number of applications that aid the user. These include the Web-Watcher at CMU [4], the LIRA system at Stanford <ref> [1] </ref>, and the Webhunter and Letizia projects at the MIT Media Lab [6]. The Softbot project at UW [2] and the FAQ Finder at the University of Chicago [3] both make use of Internet resources to answer natural-language user queries.

Reference-contexts: Newsgroups have been studied in other projects. Mostly there has been work done in filtering. The SIFT project at Stamford [9] has users submit profiles for their interest. It then uses new documents as queries on the profiles. At CMU, the Newsweeder project <ref> [5] </ref> has users rate new documents in terms of relevance, and attempts to learn these ratings for classifying future documents. There are other interesting applications in this domain. The inverse of filtering is classification: given a document to be posted, determine the most appropriate group for it.

Reference-contexts: The large amounts of new data that appear daily on the Internet bring a number of challenges. This data cannot be easily processed by humans. Hence, relevance judgments, such as those provided in the Tipster collection <ref> [7] </ref>, will not be readily available. More data means more documents, which means more words and terms to analyze. We will need some way to pick out the terms and phrases that carry meaning. Also there is a large amount of data that is essentially meaningless.

Reference-contexts: Hence, a user interested in one document from a group would want to retrieve others from that group. We wanted to see how well current systems (that do not try to learn) will perform on this kind of task. Our system of choice was SMART, developed by Salton <ref> [8] </ref>. 1 We created collections of documents drawn from var-ious subsets of the USENET hierarchy (minus their headers). SMART converts each of these documents into a vector whose features are the terms in the posting (removing stopwords like "the", and stemming).

Reference-contexts: These may share none of the same terms, but they are all "about" AI. Newsgroups have been studied in other projects. Mostly there has been work done in filtering.
