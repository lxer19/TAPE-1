Abstract: We describe a rule-based approach to semantic specification that can be used to dynamically establish semantic relevance between consumers' queries posed on the fly and producers' data sources available online. The semantic specification of user queries is independent of the content and capabilities of the data sources (query-to-source independence). The semantic specification of the content and capability of a data source is independent of the content and capability descriptions of other sources (source-to-source independence). Query processing techniques use these specifications along with the query modification and transformation routines to perform relevance reasoning and to guarantee semantically correct query answers. This work also examines the effect of changing metadata semantics, such as changes in the content and capabilitiy descriptions of data sources or the user query profile specifications. Methods are described for detecting these changes and for determining if the information sources can continue to supply meaningful data to answering consumers' queries. These methods and transformation routines are necessary for determining logical connectivity between information producers and information consumers and for establishing dynamic interconnection between a growing collection of data sources and a consumer's query.

Reference-contexts: If new sources are available online, the metadata manager will extend the reevaluation process to perform the two levels of relevance pruning over these new sources. 5 Conclusion Several approaches have been proposed for querying multiple heterogeneous information sources using mediator-based architecture, such as TSIMMIS [4], Information Manifold [7], DISCO <ref> [3] </ref>, and the context interchange project [13]. The key aspect distinguishing DIOM from other systems is its strive for logical independence (e.g., query independence and source independence).

Reference-contexts: In [11], McCarthy presents a metadata representation language. It allows the inclusion of a wide range of metadata accessible through a set of operators specially defined for metadata manipulation. <ref> [5] </ref> uses knowledge-based representation for metadata. However, neither of these methods discuss the practical means for defining comparable concepts and relating concepts at schema level and data level to facilitate the processing of queries over heterogeneous data sources. We intend to use metadata to address the following questions: 3 1.

Reference-contexts: In DIOM, the semantic relevance reasoning is mainly conducted in the query routing stage, the first step in the DIOM dynamic query processing framework. The detailed routing strategies and algorithms are beyond the subject of this paper. Readers who are interested in further details may refer to <ref> [8] </ref>. For level-one relevance reasoning, we compare the scope specification of a user query Q with the content and category specificaton of the set of available data sources, say S 1 ; :::; S n .

Reference-contexts: Then we discuss the methods that use these metadata profiles to identify and locate the data sources that contain semantically correct answers. We call this functionality query routing in DIOM, a mediator-wrapper based system <ref> [9] </ref> for querying heterogeneous information sources. Query routing is the first optimization step that constrains the search space for a query in open environments, in preparation for query execution planning.

Reference-contexts: We may ask query Q: get the title, price, the supplier, and the reviews of books about cancer that were published in 1996. We may enter the query using a SQL-like on-line form (e.g., The DIOM Interface Query Language: IQL <ref> [10] </ref>) as follows: SELECT B.title, B.price, R.review, B.supplier FROM Book B, Review R WHERE B.description CONTAINS `cancer' .AND. B.year = 1996 .AND. <p> Note that all the input arguments in a query need to be satisfied and thus their binding options are mandatory, but sometimes we may allow certain outputs to be absent <ref> [10] </ref> in the answer by indicating their Bopt to be optional. In our initial implementation, the user query profiles are created using an interactive dialog interface program. A dialog screen will be pop up whenever the user poses a query on the fly.
