Abstract: This paper presents an AI-planning-based framework to support the activities of a human operator in a supervisory control system. The framework uses an AI planning and learning substrate architecture and is designed for integration within a general third-party real time software. Our goal is to build a test-bed architecture for research in AI planning applications, such as electrical and industrial processes. AI planning techniques, as opposed to the more traditionally used rule-based systems, can be useful in the automation of the supervision of process systems, as they provide rich planning representations and algorithms. We present our work developing an AI planning system for a boiler power plant domain. We develop a set of planning operators from an extended multilevel flow modeling (MFM) of the plant. Our planner reasons about goals and its subgoals, generates plans for different scenarios, including the sequence for start-up the plant. We show our approach to acquire the domain knowledge, which is a well-known difficult enterprise for real-world applications. We demonstrate that our modeling approach built upon MFM is successful in mapping the supervisory system knowledge into a planning representation.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, many AI and control engineering researchers pursue the investigation of this potentially powerful combination of AI and real systems ([1], <ref> [2] </ref>, [3], [4]). In this paper, we report on our work on flexibly representing a functional model of a supervisory control system, such as a power plant in an AI planning system. We build upon the multilevel flow model (MFM) and its initial proposed application to planning. <p> These activities were ordered according to the sequence required to enable and establish the MFM functions. Chemical process domain To show the flexibility of our approach we have developed an MFM-based planning domain to generate operating procedures of a chemical process <ref> [2] </ref> . The power plant domain has been modified to support the specific activities of purge operations. In this domain, we address the problem of mixing constraints which commonly arise in chemical process planning problems. 6.

In this paper, we report on our work on flexibly representing a functional model of a supervisory control system, such as a power plant in an AI planning system. We build upon the multilevel flow model (MFM) and its initial proposed application to planning. <p> They should be interpreted as more general functional concepts. A comprehensive understanding of these differences requires more experience and more studies. Acquiring the MFM models is beyond the scope of our work. Others, including [8] and <ref> [3] </ref>, have studied methods for building a model based on MFM. of a tank that stores some material and the inlet valve (valve-A) and the outlet valve (valve-D). The tank has two level sensors, namely a high-level (HL) and a low-level sensor (LL), to signal full and empty tank, respectively. <p> The storage Stg1 function represents the tank, the transport Tr1 the function of the input valve, valve-A, and the transport Tr2 the function of the discharge valve, valve-D. So1 represents the source of material and Si1 the system that consumes the material. Deriving planning knowledge from MFM In <ref> [3] </ref>, Larsen applied the MFM methodology to acquire specific knowledge for generating a sequence of actions to start up a boiler power plant. <p> However, we show our approach to decompose the functions toward a lower level of abstraction in order to provide more details in the solution. We show one refinement in the feed water system to illustrate how our approach explores the MFM whole-part decomposition. In <ref> [3] </ref>, Larsen built an MFM model of a boiler power plant. The complete model that is composed of three MFM structures will not be shown here; however, Figure 6 shows the MFM model of the steam and the feed water system that will be used to illustrate our approach.

Reference-contexts: We build upon the multilevel flow model (MFM) and its initial proposed application to planning. Our planning mechanism is based on the Prodigy architecture, a domain independent planning and learning system <ref> [5] </ref>. The article is organized as follows: Section 2 overviews the proposed supervisory system. Section 3 describes briefly the MFM concepts and we present our planning knowledge acquisition approach through a simple industrial process. Section 4 introduces the general framework to acquire the planning model.

Reference-contexts: The nonlinear character of the planner stems from its dynamic goal selection which enables the planner to fully interleave plans, exploiting common subgoals and addressing issues of resource contention. User Prodigy Interface: We are currently developing extensions to the user interface provided by Prodigy <ref> [6] </ref> in order to provide a friendly communication to the human operator. Basically, this extensions will allow the human operator to set a problem and to receive a solution.

Reference-contexts: The most sophisticated systems support a complete application development environment for building and deploying intelligent applications, such as G2. However, in general, they are based on generic rules and procedures to represent the expert knowledge. 3. Multilevel Flow Modeling In <ref> [7] </ref>, Lind describes a multilevel flow model (MFM) for engineering systems. This model constitutes a significant advance in abstracting the high-level functional description of a system from the low-level technical implementation details. MFM introduces goals as necessary concepts to capture the purposes of an engineering system.

The modeling system provides an intermediate step to acquire the planning knowledge. However, we assume that the model exists already. This means that someone have identified the function and goals according to the method presented in <ref> [8] </ref>. We have defined a model representation for planning purposes based on the conditions required to enable and establish the MFM functions.
