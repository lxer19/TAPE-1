Title: On the Semantics of Belief Revision Systems  
Author: Gosta Grahne Alberto O. Mendelzon and Ray Reiter 
Abstract: We consider belief revision operators that satisfy the Alchourron-Gardenfors-Makinson postulates, and present an epistemic logic in which, for any such revision operator, the result of a revision can be described by a sentence in the logic. In our logic, the fact that the agent's set of beliefs is is represented by the sentence O, where O is Levesque's `only know' operator. Intuitively, O is read as ` is all that is believed.' The fact that the agent believes is represented by the sentence B , read in the usual way as ` is believed'. The connective represents update as defined by Katsuno and Mendelzon. The revised beliefs are represented by the sentence O B . We show that for every revision operator that satisfies the AGM postulates, there is a model for our epistemic logic such that the beliefs implied by the sentence O B in this model correspond exactly to the sentences implied by the theory that results from revising by . This means that reasoning about changes in the agent's beliefs reduces to model checking of certain epistemic sentences. The negative result in the paper is that this type of formal account of revision cannot be extended to the situation where the agent is able to reason about its beliefs. A fully introspective agent cannot use our construction to reason about the results of its own revisions, on pain of triviality.

An interesting extension would be to include multiple agents and a notion of `common knowledge', as in Fagin, Halpern, Moses and Vardi <ref> [4] </ref>, since a formal analysis of their `muddy children puzzle' requires the concept of belief revision to describe how the children's beliefs change as a consequence of the father's statements.

Note that a revision in the agent's universe of discourse is translated into an update at the meta level. Intuitively, the reason is that update, and not revision, is the operator that serves to accommodate changes in the world.
