Reference-contexts: Proof. (Sketch) The proof is based on the following three simple statements (stated infor mally first) which we will not prove.

Let H be the graph consisting of this regular pair with the edges inside the two clusters put back.

Most people believed that in Theorem 3.3 the upper bound n 2 =8 can be improved to o (n 2 ). <p> Here we formulate the following result of Ajtai, Komlos and Szemeredi.

Reference-contexts: In fact, it allows "k 2 pairs to be irregular. For a long time it was not known if there must be irregular pairs at all. It turned out that there must be at least ck irregular pairs. Alon, Duke, Leffman, Rodl and Yuster <ref> [3] </ref> write: "In [121] the author raises the question if the assertion of the lemma holds when we do not allow any irregular pairs in the definition of a regular partition. This, however, is not true, as observed by several researchers, including L. Lovasz, P. Seymour, T. Trotter and ourselves. <p> statements (stated infor mally first) which we will not prove. [1] If ff (G) &lt; t (G) then K 3 G (This is trivial.)

If more than k 2 =4 edges in R are present, then, by Turan's theorem, R has a triangle. We can use <ref> [3] </ref> (with fi = ") to show that K 4 G 00 . Case II. X 1i&lt;jk Hence, if at most k 2 =4 of these densities are non-zero, then their average is greater than d = 1=2 + 4". <p> For their beautiful conjecture (that even ff = 0 works) see Section 6. 4.2 Large subgraphs with bounded degrees The following theorem is implicit in Chvatal-Rodl-Szemeredi-Trotter 1983 [27] (according to Alon, Duke, Leffman, Rodl and Yuster <ref> [3] </ref>). Theorem 4.2. For any ; fi &gt; 0 there is a c &gt; 0 such that if e (G n ) &gt; fin 2 , then G n contains as subgraphs all bipartite graphs H with jV (H)j cn and (H) . Proof. <p> This can be done naturally by using the Regularity Lemma to select a regular pair (and throw away a few vertices to get all degrees large). This was the way the following more general result was proved. Theorem 7.10. (Alon-Duke-Leffman-Rodl-Yuster 1993 <ref> [3] </ref>) For each c &gt; 0 there is a c 0 &gt; 0 such that e (G n ) &gt; cn 2 and e (H) &lt; c 0 n imply that H is a topological subgraph of G n . <p> A cylinder is "-regular if in G all the pairs (W i ; W j ) are "-regular. The following theorem is from the paper of Alon, Duke, Leffman, Rodl and Yuster <ref> [3] </ref>. Theorem 7.15. (Lemma 5.1 in [3]) For every " &gt; 0 there exists a K such that if G (A 1 ; A 2 ; : : : ; A r ), jA 1 j = : : : = jA r j, is an r-partite graph, then, for some <p> A cylinder is "-regular if in G all the pairs (W i ; W j ) are "-regular. The following theorem is from the paper of Alon, Duke, Leffman, Rodl and Yuster <ref> [3] </ref>. Theorem 7.15. (Lemma 5.1 in [3]) For every " &gt; 0 there exists a K such that if G (A 1 ; A 2 ; : : : ; A r ), jA 1 j = : : : = jA r j, is an r-partite graph, then, for some k K, one can partition the <p> Furthermore, K &lt; 4 ( r 2 ) =" 5 As it is remarked in <ref> [3] </ref>, a similar lemma was proved by Eaton and Rodl [35]. 8 Strengthening the Regularity Lemma 8.1 Sparse-graph versions of the Regularity Lemma It would be very important to find extensions of the Regularity Lemma for sparse graphs, e.g., for graphs where we assume only that e (G n ) &gt; <p> Thus by turning the lemma from an existence-theorem into an algorithm one can transform many of the earlier existence results into relatively efficient algorithms. The first step in this direction was made by Alon, Duke, Leffman, Rodl and Yuster <ref> [3] </ref>. In the second type of use, one takes advantage of the fact that the regularity lemma provides a random-like substructure of any dense graph. We know that many algorithms fail on ran-domlike objects. So one can use the Regularity Lemma to prove lower bounds in complexity theory, see e.g. <p> The answer due to Alon, Duke, Lefmann Rodl and Yuster <ref> [3] </ref> is surprising, at least at first: Given a graph G, we can find regular partitions in polynomially many steps, however, if we describe this partition to someone else, he cannot verify in polynomial time that our partition is really "-regular: he has better produce his own regular partition.

Reference-contexts: The particular case when G 0 n has maximum degree 2 was separately conjectured by Sauer and Spencer in 1978 [109] (disjoint union of cycles) and was recently solved for large n by Noga Alon and Eldar Fischer <ref> [4] </ref>. (Note that the hardship again comes from the fact that the graph H to be embedded is spanning.

Reference-contexts: While this is something of an anachronism the original proof ideas are not lost, they are just basically summarized in the Key Lemma. - 21 - 4.1 Packing with small graphs Theorem 4.1 (Alon-Yuster 1992 <ref> [6] </ref>). For any ff &gt; 0 and H there is an n 0 such that n n 0 ; ffi (G n ) &gt; 1 (H) ! imply that there are (1 ff)n=jV (H)j vertex-disjoint copies of H in G n . <p> Alon-Fischer result mentioned in the previous subsection, for the square of a Hamilton path contains all unions of cycles.) We do not detail the exact statements in these papers, since none of the papers employ the Regularity Lemma. 6.3 The Alon-Yuster conjecture The beautiful conjecture of Alon and Yuster 1992 <ref> [6] </ref> generalizes the celebrated Hajnal Szemeredi theorem from covering with cliques to covering with copies of an arbitrary (fixed) graph H. A solution has been announced recently: Theorem 6.4 (Komlos-Sarkozy-Szemeredi 1995 [87]). <p> For every graph H there is a constant K such that ffi (G n ) 1 (H) n implies that there is a union of vertex-disjoint copies of H covering all but at most K vertices of G n . - 27 - A simple example in <ref> [6] </ref> shows that K = 0 cannot always be achieved even when v (H) divides v (G).

Reference-contexts: In this paper we consider almost exclusively graph theoretical applications. However, the lemma was invented to solve number-theoretical problems, and it is still used for this purpose also.

Reference-contexts: Szemeredi's theorem was also proved by Furstenberg [67] in 1977 using ergodic theoretical methods. It was not quite clear first if the Furstenberg proof was really different from that of Szemeredi, but subsequent generalizations due to Furstenberg and Katznelson [69] and later by Bergelson and Leibman <ref> [10] </ref> convinced the mathematical community that Ergodic Theory is a natural tool to attack combinatorial questions.

Theorem 3.4 has two proofs in <ref> [16] </ref>: one with and one without the Regularity Lemma. In many cases, the application of the Regularity Lemma makes things transparent but the same results can be achieved without it equally easily.

Reference-contexts: If H is a 2-diameter-critical graph, then H (a 1 ; : : : ; a k ) is also 2-diameter-critical. So T n;2 , and more generally of K (a; b), are 2-diameter-critical. Indepen dently, Murty and Simon (see in <ref> [24] </ref>) formulated the following conjecture: Conjecture 3.11. If G n is a minimal graph of diameter 2, then e (G) bn 2 =4c. Equality holds if and only if G n is the complete bipartite graph K bn=2c;dn=2e . Furedi used the Regularity Lemma to prove this.

Reference-contexts: The authors write: "... We hope that this will prove to be nearly as useful as Szemeredi's theorem. So far we have found two applications, proof of a conjecture of Erd-os concerning Turan type problems [42, 62] and giving an alternative condition for quasiran-domness <ref> [25] </ref>. Proofs of these applications will be the subject of a subsequent paper." One problem with the hypergraph version is that one feels that there must be more than one possible generalizations. When regarding 3-graphs, one can think of partitioning the vertices or the pairs of vertices. <p> Later we will discuss the problem of quasi-random hypergraphs. This led Fan Chung to her formulation of the hypergraph-regularity lemma stated below. Since the paper of Frankl and Rodl is somewhat concise and not too easy to read, we restrict ourselves below to formulating Fan Chung's <ref> [25] </ref> hypergraph regularity lemma. This version has 2 parameters: k and r &lt; k. <p> For graphs, Simonovits and Sos [116] have shown that quasi-randomness can also be characterized by using the Regularity Lemma. Fan Chung <ref> [25] </ref> generalized their results to hypergraphs. Let N fl G (L) and N G (L) denote the number of induced and not necessarily induced copies of L in G, respectively. <p> Simonovits and Sos [116] proved that P S is a quasi-random property, i.e. P S () P i for 1 i 7. In fact, they proved some stronger results, but we skip the details. F.R.K. Chung generalized these results to hypergraphs <ref> [25] </ref>. Acknowledgements.

Reference-contexts: The proof uses the Regularity Lemma. 10.3 Quasi-randomness and the Regularity Lemma Quasi-random structures have been investigated by several authors, among others, by Thoma-son [123], Chung, Graham, Wilson, <ref> [26] </ref>. For graphs, Simonovits and Sos [116] have shown that quasi-randomness can also be characterized by using the Regularity Lemma. Fan Chung [25] generalized their results to hypergraphs. <p> The theorem asserts that even if we do not assume that a sequence (G n ) is a random graph sequence, the properties listed below are equivalent. Theorem 10.7 (Chung-Graham-Wilson <ref> [26] </ref>). For any graph sequence (G n ) the fol lowing properties are equivalent: P 1 (-): for fixed -, for all graphs H - N fl 2 ) : P 2 (t): Let C t denote the cycle of length t. <p> In P 2 (t) we restrict ourselves to not necessarily induced even cycles. The difference between the role of the odd and even cycles is explained in <ref> [26] </ref>. The eigenvalue property is also very natural, knowing the connection between the structural properties of graphs and their eigenvalues. The other properties are self-explanatory. Simonovits and Sos formulated a graph property which also proved to be a quasi-random property.

Reference-contexts: Szemeredi's theorem was also proved by Furstenberg [67] in 1977 using ergodic theoretical methods.

Reference-contexts: Just as Turan's theorem or Dirac's theorem are the standard tools in simple applications of the Regularity Lemma, the following deep theorem of Hajnal and Szemeredi is the key element in sophisticated applications. Theorem 2.7 (Hajnal-Szemeredi 1969 <ref> [73] </ref>, Complementary Form). <p> The notion of packing plays an important role in the investigation of computational complexity of graph properties among other things. Thus it is not surprising that in recent research literature there is considerable interest in packing-type results and problems (see e.g. <ref> [11, 14, 73, 109] </ref>). Bollobas [11] conjectured that trees of bounded degrees can be embedded into graphs of degree roughly n=2. It was recently proved by J. Komlos, G. N. Sarkozy and E. Szemeredi.

Reference-contexts: The example of the complete bipartite graph K cn;(1c)n shows that f (c) &gt; c 2 cannot be hoped for. The Regularity Lemma argument only gives something like f (c) &gt; 1=tower (1=c). Erd-os asked if a polynomial lower bound for f (c) can be found. In <ref> [88] </ref>, Komlos and Sos provide such a bound by a simple application of the functional method (with (G) = v (G)d r (G)). In fact, they show the almost optimal f (c) &lt; c 2 = log (2=c).

Reference-contexts: Theorem 2.4. If L is finite and min L2L (L) = p &gt; 1, then ex (n; L) = 1 p 1 n ! So this theorem plays a crucial role in extremal graph theory. (For structural generalizations for arbitrary L see <ref> [36, 37, 113] </ref>.) Its basic message is that the critical parameter determining whether a graph L is a subgraph of all graphs G n with a given edge density, is the chromatic number of L. <p> To formulate them we should introduce the notion of the "decomposition family" of L <ref> [113] </ref>. To keep the paper short we skip these more technical details and formulate a weaker version. Theorem 10.4. Let L be a given 3-chromatic graph. Let p 2 (0; 1) be fixed and let R n be a p-random graph.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, F n is almost surely bipartite. Definition 10.2 (Critical edges).

Theorem 10.1 also generalizes to every 3-chromatic L containing a critical edge e, and for every probability p &gt; 0. Theorem 10.3.

Reference-contexts: Hence the Key Lemma guarantees that G n contains K p (t; : : : ; t) provided n is large in terms of t. It is easy to see that we, in fact, proved the following stronger statement.

For graphs, Simonovits and Sos <ref> [116] </ref> have shown that quasi-randomness can also be characterized by using the Regularity Lemma. Fan Chung [25] generalized their results to hypergraphs. Let N fl G (L) and N G (L) denote the number of induced and not necessarily induced copies of L in G, respectively. <p> It is easy to see that if (G n ) is a random graph sequence of probability 1=2, then P S holds for (G n ), almost surely. Simonovits and Sos <ref> [116] </ref> proved that P S is a quasi-random property, i.e. P S () P i for 1 i 7. In fact, they proved some stronger results, but we skip the details. F.R.K.
