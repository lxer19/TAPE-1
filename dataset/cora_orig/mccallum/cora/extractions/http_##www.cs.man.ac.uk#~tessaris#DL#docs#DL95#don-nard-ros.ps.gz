Abstract: We consider the epistemic concept language proposed in [5], which has been used to formalize procedural rules and weak definitions using a very restricted form of epis-temic sentences. Our statement is that there are a number of other uses of the epistemic operator that require different forms of epistemic sentences in the knowledge base. To justify this statement we briefly recall the epis-temic language ALCK, then address the formalization of defaults, and provide examples of assertions including epistemic operators in the construct for universal quantification on roles and in the scope of existential quantification on roles.

Reference-contexts: In fact, frame-based systems, as well as systems based on concept languages [3, 13], admit both forms of non-monotonic reasoning, such as defaults and closed world reasoning, and procedural features, e.g. rules. These issues have been addressed in the recent literature (see for example <ref> [1, 5, 16, 17, 22] </ref>), but the proposals typically capture one of the above mentioned aspects. <p> In the setting of concept languages we have to deal with the issue of giving a semantics to open defaults, i.e. defaults in which free variables occur. The semantics of open defaults is still debated [12, 2]. We assume the semantics proposed by Baader and Hollunder <ref> [1] </ref>, which restricts the application of defaults only to the individuals explicitly mentioned in the ABox. Notice that this semantics can be viewed as the natural extension of the semantics of rules given in [5], where rules apply only to the known individuals in the knowledge base.

These issues have been addressed in the recent literature (see for example [1, 5, 16, 17, 22]), but the proposals typically capture one of the above mentioned aspects. <p> In this setting it is possible to formalize procedural rules in the style of CLASSIC <ref> [3] </ref>, and weak definitions that arise by treating the definition A : two weaker inclusions fKA v D; KD v Ag. In this section we consider knowledge bases with more general forms of epistemic sentences. <p> In the following we first show that role closure can be nicely formalized in our setting by using epistemic roles, then we discuss a new form of closure obtained by using epistemic concept expressions. Closure on roles is available both in CLASSIC (see <ref> [3] </ref>) and in LOOM (see [13]). The idea is to restrict universal role quantifications to the known individuals filling the role in the knowledge base. The following example has been developed in the system CLASSIC.

Reference-contexts: In fact, frame-based systems, as well as systems based on concept languages [3, 13], admit both forms of non-monotonic reasoning, such as defaults and closed world reasoning, and procedural features, e.g. rules. These issues have been addressed in the recent literature (see for example <ref> [1, 5, 16, 17, 22] </ref>), but the proposals typically capture one of the above mentioned aspects. <p> We provide an example of this enriched expressivity by extending the idea of closure to concepts. The work extends the approach taken in <ref> [5] </ref> in two respects. From the point of view of the formalism we consider a family of logics, i.e. the ground nonmonotonic modal logics, that is parameterized with respect to the possible world structures used to interpret the modal operator. <p> From the point of view of the language we are able to address defaults, and to show that they can not be adequalely represented in the framework proposed in <ref> [5] </ref>. The paper is organized as follows. We briefly recall the epistemic language ALCK, then discuss different interpretations of the modal operator and address the representation of defaults in the epistemic concept language. <p> The general form of the semantics is based on a preference criterion on epistemic interpretations; a full definition is given in [15]. Here we recall the special case where R = W fi W, corresponding to consider the so-called universal S5 models, considered in <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> A justification-free default is a default where the justification part is empty, i.e. of the form ff: fl . As we shall see later, this kind of defaults correspond to trigger rules, whose formalization in the language ALCK has been studied in <ref> [5] </ref>. We are interested in the translation of a default theory into a modal theory. Therefore we give the following definitions (taken from [7]). <p> We assume the semantics proposed by Baader and Hollunder [1], which restricts the application of defaults only to the individuals explicitly mentioned in the ABox. Notice that this semantics can be viewed as the natural extension of the semantics of rules given in <ref> [5] </ref>, where rules apply only to the known individuals in the knowledge base. The following theorem shows that, under this semantics, default theories are expressible in a large subset of the family ALCK (S G ). <p> Notice that the formalization of procedural rules given by <ref> [5] </ref>, is the same obtained by applying emb to justification-free defaults. <p> It can be shown that, with respect to ALCK (S5 G ), the modification of the semantics for the modal operator does not affect the behaviour of knowledge bases which employ the epistemic operator only in the formalization of weak definitions and rules as introduced in <ref> [5] </ref>. Now we consider logic ALCK (S4F G ). The modified semantics does not change the interpretation of epistemic queries (this is a result valid for each concept language ALCK (S G )). Therefore we can extend to ALCK (S4F G ) the properties shown in [5] for ALCK (S5 G <p> rules as introduced in <ref> [5] </ref>. Now we consider logic ALCK (S4F G ). The modified semantics does not change the interpretation of epistemic queries (this is a result valid for each concept language ALCK (S G )). Therefore we can extend to ALCK (S4F G ) the properties shown in [5] for ALCK (S5 G ), in particular the ability to express forms procedural rules. Moreover, the last theorem states that ALCK S4F G allows for the formalization of defaults. We can define a decision procedure for ALCK (S4F G )- knowledge bases containing defaults, and allowing epis-temic queries. <p> Consequently, instance checking for this kind of ALCK (S4F G )-knowledge bases is a decidable problem. 4 Epistemic knowledge bases The use of the modal operator to represent features offered by current systems based on concept languages has been addressed in <ref> [5] </ref>, where two settings are proposed: 1. the knowledge base is constituted by a set of non-epistemic assertions and the epistemic operator is allowed in the query language only.

Reference-contexts: These issues have been addressed in the recent literature (see for example [1, 5, 16, 17, 22]), but the proposals typically capture one of the above mentioned aspects. In this paper we propose a concept language with an epistemic operator interpreted in terms of minimal knowledge <ref> [8, 6, 11] </ref>, and we show that it provides an adequate treatment of the following features: defaults, procedural rules, weak definitions and role closures, as they are provided in the most popular systems based on concept languages. <p> We will show that this particular logic does not admit any modular translation for default theories, while such a translation is possible in the case of ground logics built from modal systems different from S5. We first briefly recall propositional ground modal logics <ref> [20, 23, 9, 6] </ref> and default logic [18], then show some properties of this family of logics with respect to their ability to capture rules and defaults, and finally turn our attention to concept languages by defining a modal concept language which admits a modular translation for default theories.

In particular, we would like to be able to turn each default into a modal sentence, independently of other defaults. Such translations are called modular.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Concept languages (also called terminological logics, description languages) have been studied in the past years to provide a formal characterization of frame-based system. However, while the fragment of first-order logic which characterizes the most popular constructs of these languages has been clearly identified (see for example <ref> [25] </ref>), there is not yet consensus on the practical aspects of frame systems that cannot be formalized in a first-order setting.
