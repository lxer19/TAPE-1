Abstract: Host mobility and wireless access are two emerging design considerations that pose challenging problems at all layers of the networking protocol stack. This dissertation investigates their impact on the design of link, network, and transport layer protocols. At the network layer, we have designed and implemented a new routing architecture that allows the current set of Internet standards to support routing to mobile hosts. At the link and transport layers, we have designed mechanisms to improve throughput over error-prone wireless channels. At the network layer, the most crucial problem is that of routing. The existing Internet routing mechanisms cannot route packets to hosts whose points of attachment to the network change over time. Exploiting IP's Loose Source Route option, we have designed and implemented a routing scheme which provides location independent network access to TCP/IP compliant mobile hosts. It also allows mobile hosts equipped with multiple network interfaces to dynamically migrate active network sessions from one network interface to another. The proposed scheme only requires the addition of two new entity types, Mobile Routers and Mobile Access Stations. These entities perform all required mobility-aware functions, such as address translation, user tracking and location management. No modifications to existing host or router software are required. Although MobileIP provides continuous network connectivity to mobile hosts, the effects of host movement and wireless medium characteristics are often visible at the transport layer. We

Reference-contexts: Names are user defined aliases (strings of characters) which are used to denote hosts. For example, ballast is the name of the file-server in our department, and its address is 128.8.128.88. An important distinction between names and addresses is that addresses are protocol specific (e.g., an IP address, CLNP <ref> [1] </ref> address, IPX [50] address, XNS address), but names are not. Names provide a way for applications to make reference to network entities without having to know anything about the underlying network protocol in use.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the CSDP proposal complements rather than compete with other proposals. The level of achievable performance of the CDPS approach depends on the accuracy of the channel state predictor. Under the assumption of full channel knowledge, we have observed up to 15% improvement in channel utilization <ref> [8] </ref>. Even in absence of the channel state information, we have shown that the round robin version of the CSDP scheduler provides significant performance improvement over a pure FIFO dispatcher.

Reference-contexts: Portable computers frequently operate without network connections, or are at times connected via low-bandwidth, high-cost link that must be used sparingly. Existing applications which depend on network support typically `hang' when network connectivity is disrupted <ref> [10] </ref>. Examples of such applications include NFS [52], X-windows [54] and numerous other client-server applications. <p> Slow links introduce delays and cause performance degradation visible to the mobile user. To alleviate this problem, new mechanisms are required that enable mobile hosts to discover and access resources on the foreign network <ref> [10] </ref>. ATM is rapidly evolving as a high speed packet switching technology which promises to provide support for integrated services traffic. Integrating mobile end-systems within a connection-oriented ATM environment is a challenging open problem.

Reference-contexts: In this dissertation, we focus only on the link, network, and transport layer issues that pertain to the design of mobile networking systems. Our experience, however, has led us to believe that the realm of the problems involved is not limited to these layers <ref> [11] </ref>. In fact, the domain of related problems spans the entire protocol stack (see Figure 1.2). The main reason is that the Internet and OSI protocols were standardized prior to the technological revolution that shaped today's computing environment.

Reference-contexts: The key feature of this proposal is that it enables function f to be co-located with all internet hosts without requiring changes to host software. All internet hosts, when generating replies to packets that are received with the LSR option, are required to do the route reversal <ref> [12] </ref>. For TCP connections, the route reversal is performed by the protocol processing module, and in case of UDP connections, this responsibility lies with the applications. From our reference architecture view point, the process of route reversal amounts to the task that an ATA is required to carry out. <p> A source can specify a list of routers which are to be visited in the specified sequence before the datagram is delivered to the final destination. According to the host requirements document <ref> [12] </ref>, return traffic to the originator of the loose source routed packet is also sent with 36 the LSR option by reversing the route taken by the incoming packets. We use this technique to achieve optimal routing between an MH and a CH.

A multihomed host has multiple identities (IP addresses), and each one of those can be used to set up a network connection to the host.

Reference-contexts: An existing LSR option in an outgoing packet has already been extended by 46 the MR to include the local MAS as a required intermediate router for the source route. This model of operation conforms to the description given in Comer <ref> [16] </ref>. However, since in most current implementations all routing is done on the basis of the destination address, the actual operation is somewhat different (see Figures 3.11 and 3.12).

Reference-contexts: However, WLAN channels are more susceptible to losses because of the higher bit rates and lack of sophisticated signal processing techniques such as adaptive power control, forward error correction, and bit interleaving. Measurements of a particular WLAN system <ref> [20] </ref> show that packet-error rates critically depend on the distance between the transmitter and receiver, and surprisingly, are not monotonically increasing with this distance. <p> We use this observation to capture packet loss characteristics by a 2-state Markov model. This model conforms with the observation reported in some of the earlier empirical studies of packet loss behavior on wireless LANs <ref> [20] </ref>. At any point in time, we model the channel as being in one of the two possible states, G (good) or B (bad). We use the term, p S to denote the packet loss probability in state S, where S 2 fG; Bg. <p> Recent performance studies <ref> [20] </ref> and our experience with RF wireless LANs have shown that error behavior on wireless channels is often bursty.

Reference-contexts: Since the behavior of TCP sources cannot be captured by any closed form analytical expression, it is not possible to analyze this system mathematically. To perform a careful investigation of this interaction we decided to conduct some experiments on the NETSIM <ref> [21] </ref> simulator. Each simulation run involves data transfer over N simultaneous TCP sessions, each starting from a stationary host and terminating at a mobile host. During the course of data transfer, channels between the base station and mobile hosts are independently subject to burst errors.

Reference-contexts: The key feature of our design is that all required functionalities for processing and managing mobility information is embedded in specialized entities, called Mobile Router and Mobile Access Station. Contemporary solutions either require changes to the existing network architecture [49] or introduce new encapsulation protocols <ref> [22, 51] </ref> to handle this problem. Our approach, since it exploits existing mechanisms available within IP, is completely transparent to the transport and higher layers and does not require any changes to existing internet hosts and routers. MobileIP only provides a mechanism for packet exchange among mobile and stationary end-systems. <p> Below, we present a short summary of related MobileIP proposals, with a short note following each proposal outlining how its operation can be captured by our proposed solution architecture. 2.4.1 Columbia Scheme The scheme proposed by Ioannidis <ref> [22, 23] </ref> is designed primarily to support mobility within a campus environment. Mobile hosts are allocated addresses from a subnetwork which is reserved for use by wireless hosts. A group of cooperating Mobile Support Routers (MSR), advertise reachability to the wireless subnet. <p> For this reason, many routers disable this. Note that encapsulation based methods also have the same problem unless each address translation agent (such as an Mobile Support Router (MSR) in the Columbia scheme <ref> [22] </ref>) knows every other forwarding agent. We should not overlook the benefits of source routing only on the basis of security limitation. IP itself has a lot of security holes. Besides, mobile networks, due to wireless links, are quite prone to security attacks. <p> We have proposed a network layer solution architecture which enables smooth integration of mobile end systems within the existing Internet. This architecture not only generalizes the previous schemes proposed for MobileIP <ref> [47, 51, 22, 36] </ref>, but it also provides a basis for evaluating the trade-off between various design alternatives for mobile networking systems. * Exploiting IP's LSR option, we have proposed a MobileIP protocol which provides location independent network access to TCP/IP compliant hosts.

Similarly, after the 3 rd burst error period, which occurs at t = 12:8 seconds, TCP takes 1.01 seconds to resume the slow start <ref> [24] </ref> phase. In [15], similar phenomenon was pointed out in the context of losses during handoff. <p> The connection setup fails if the 3 rd SYN packet is also lost. The main reason behind these problems is that TCP was designed around the assumption that links are reliable. It interprets packet losses as signs of network congestion and consequently reacts by invoking congestion control mechanisms <ref> [24] </ref>. This is justified if underlying links are reliable, in which case the reason behind the packet loss is likely to be congestion and the only remedy is a reduction of input rate.

Reference-contexts: The distinction between the wired and wireless channels arises for many reasons. As users move, the received signal strength varies significantly. In addition, there are effects due to fading, interference from other users, and shadowing from objects, all of which degrade the channel performance <ref> [25] </ref>. Frequency-hopping WLANs are further subject to a unique error phenomenon. The WLAN may hop onto a frequency channel which is particularly susceptible to interference (e.g., a subset of the mobile users may be close to some other entity transmitting at that frequency).

Reference-contexts: ready for transmission which would force the receiver to generate ACKs. 2 W is the window size and mss is the segment size. 75 Exponential Retransmit Back-off: If retransmission occurs during a period when the channel is in a burst error state, the retransmit timeout value is doubled by Karn's <ref> [27] </ref> exponential retransmit back-off algorithm. For example, in Figure 5.4, the packet retransmitted at t = 5:8sec falls in the burst error zone. Since the ACK for this packet is not received, TCP doubles its retransmit timeout period to 3 seconds and retries only after it expires.

Reference-contexts: However, the risk of fragmentation is higher in an encapsulation based approach because the added encapsulation header size is greater than the LSR option size. The LSR approach also has a few shortcomings. The first problem is that UDP <ref> [39] </ref> agents 3 mbuf is a data structure that is used for dynamic memory allocation in Unix 55 do not perform route reversal. As a result, UDP packets originating from a stationary host are always routed sub-optimally via a mobile router.

Interaction of various scheduling policies with the end-to-end flow/congestion control has been analyzed before in the literature <ref> [44] </ref>. However, these studies do not consider packet losses on the output link. One of the important design considerations is to ensure that all sessions receive a fair share of the wireless bandwidth. When the medium is error free, a fair MAC protocol is sufficient to ensure this property. <p> This time difference is sufficient for link layer mechanisms to attempt loss recovery by retransmission over the wireless link. 4 Prior studies <ref> [44] </ref> of TCP dynamics have shown that packets from a TCP session have a tendency to arrive in groups.

This result, however, does not hold when input traffic and loss characteristics on output channels are correlated. As LQF attempts to serve the queue with the maximum number of packets first, the corresponding TCP source receives a bigger share of the bottleneck link.

Reference-contexts: For example, ballast is the name of the file-server in our department, and its address is 128.8.128.88. An important distinction between names and addresses is that addresses are protocol specific (e.g., an IP address, CLNP [1] address, IPX <ref> [50] </ref> address, XNS address), but names are not. Names provide a way for applications to make reference to network entities without having to know anything about the underlying network protocol in use. <p> From the transport and application layer perspective, it serves as an end-point identifier, and at the network layer, the same IP address is used as a routing directive. This problem is not specific to the Internet architecture; in fact all contemporary connection-less network architectures, such as OSI [56], IPX <ref> [50] </ref> and XNS, suffer from this problem. Since our objective is to ensure that connection do not break when hosts move, we can say that: In order to retain transport layer sessions, a mobile host's address must be preserved regardless of its point of attachment to the network.

Reference-contexts: This phenomenon results in severe performance problems; the end-to-end transport protocols incorrectly interpret these losses as signs of network congestion and react by throttling their transmission rate. Existing solutions for this problem <ref> [15, 5, 55, 2] </ref> require modifications to the transport layer protocol software of all stationary and mobile hosts, which makes their deployment difficult in practice. We have demonstrated that this problem can be alleviated by changing the packet dispatcher at the wireless link layer. <p> A method for fast recovery from losses during handoff has been proposed in [15]. It exploits TCP's fast retransmit option to reduce TCP's loss detection latency. This method, however, cannot be effectively used to recover from burst errors due to fading. In <ref> [5, 55] </ref> another scheme is proposed that splits a TCP connection into two separate connections; one between the mobile host and the base station and the other between the base station and the stationary host. <p> Another advantage is that a CSDP scheduler can be used in conjuction with the higher layer techniques for improving performance over the wireless channels <ref> [15, 5, 55] </ref>.

First, we briefly describe packet loss characteristics com 71 monly observed in indoor wireless RF LANs. <p> A layer 2 solution is attractive for many reasons. It only requires a software modification to the device driver which makes it easy to deploy and test. It can also be used in LAN-to-wireless bridges. Solutions that rely on a transport layer agent <ref> [5, 55] </ref>, or require a soft-state maintenance at the wireless access point cannot be used in wireless bridges. Recently, several techniques for improving performance over wireless channels have been proposed [14, 2, 5, 30]. These techniques provide fast recovery from losses due to handoff and errors on the wireless channels. <p> CSDP can be employed in conjunction with any wireless link layer protocol [35] to improve throughput over multiple access wireless channels. Recently, some higher layer solutions have 92 also been proposed to support efficient operation over wireless channels <ref> [15, 5, 55, 2] </ref>. Layering them on top of CSDP will yield the benefits of both approaches. We acknowledge that the issues addressed in this dissertation represent only a few points in the vast territory of open problems that remain to be explored in the area of mobile computing.

Reference-contexts: From the transport and application layer perspective, it serves as an end-point identifier, and at the network layer, the same IP address is used as a routing directive. This problem is not specific to the Internet architecture; in fact all contemporary connection-less network architectures, such as OSI <ref> [56] </ref>, IPX [50] and XNS, suffer from this problem. Since our objective is to ensure that connection do not break when hosts move, we can say that: In order to retain transport layer sessions, a mobile host's address must be preserved regardless of its point of attachment to the network.
