Abstract: The identification of metabolic systems is a complex task due to the complexity of the system and limited knowledge about the model. Mathematical equations and ODE's have been used to capture the structure of the model, and the conventional optimization techniques have been used to identify the parameters of the model. In general, however, a pure mathematical formulation of the model is difficult due to parametric uncertainty and incomplete knowledge of mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a modeling approach that (1) uses fuzzy rule-based model to augment algebraic enzyme models that are incomplete, and (2) uses a hybrid genetic algorithm to identify uncertain parameters in the model. The hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) integrates a GA with the simplex method in functional optimization to improve the GA's convergence rate. We have applied this approach to modeling the rate of three enzyme reactions in E. coli central metabolism. The proposed modeling strategy allows (1) easy incorporation of qualitative insights into a pure mathematical model and (2) adaptive identification and optimization of key parameters to fit system behaviors observed in biochemical experiments.

Reference-contexts: Modeling of FDP activation is achieved by introducing two fuzzy numbers c and L in the MWC equation. L and c are used for changing the shape of the curve in a MWC model <ref> (Cantor & Schimmel 1980) </ref>. If FDP is LOW then c = c 1 ; L = L 1 If FDP is HIGH then c = c 2 ; L = L 2 where c 1 , c 2 , L 1 , and L 2 constants.

Reference-contexts: We use the hybrid GA to identify the unspecified system parameters. The hybrid GA's fitness evaluation involves simulating the system-level model for each candidate system parameter set in the population. To simulate the behavior of the system, we used an existing simulation software, DDASAC <ref> (Caracotsios & Stewart 1984) </ref>, for solving non-linear ODE's numerically. In the two remaining section, we focus our discussion on the component level modeling. A more detailed discussion on our system level modeling approach can be found in (Yen et al. 1995).

Reference-contexts: The randomness and parallelism of GA often enable it to find a global optimum without being trapped in a local optimum. The GA has been proved to outperform conventional gradient search technique on difficult problems involving discontinuous, noisy, high dimensional, and multimodal objective functions <ref> (Goldberg 1989) </ref>. However, the computational cost of a GA to find a global optimum is typically very high. That is, it usually requires a large number of generations before it converges to an acceptable solution.

Reference-contexts: Genetic Algorithms Genetic algorithms are global search and optimization techniques modeled from natural genetics, exploring search space by incorporating a set of candidate solutions in parallel <ref> (Holland 1975) </ref>. A genetic algorithm (GA) maintains a population of candidate solutions where each solution is usually coded as a binary string called a chromosome. A chromosome also referred to as a genotype encodes a parameter set (i.e., a candidate solution) for a set of variables being optimized.

Reference-contexts: An example is the PPC reaction. The dots in Figure 4 summarized the experimental data in the literature about the reaction rate of PPC in different PEP concentration with different activators <ref> (Izui et al. 1981) </ref>. The following observations can be made from the figure. (1) Without any activator, the reaction proceeds at a very low rate. (2) Acetyl-CoA is a very powerful activator. (3) FDP exhibits no activation alone. (4) FDP produced a strong synertistic activation with acetyl-CoA.

A simplex is defined by N + 1 points where N is the dimension of the search space.

Reference-contexts: To reduce the computational cost of GA-based approaches to the identification of parameters for metabolic systems, we have developed a hybrid approach that integrates the GA and the simplex method to speed up the rate of convergence while avoiding being easily entrapped at a local optimum <ref> (Yen et al. 1995) </ref>. This is described in the next two sections in detail. Simplex Method Simplex method is a local search technique that ueses the evaluation of the current data set to determine the promising direction of search. <p> Consequently, it is difficult to compute the derivatives needed by the gradient-based methods. A Hybrid Genetic Algorithm Using Simplex Method We developed a hybrid GA method by introducing the simplex method as an additional local search operator in the genetic algorithm <ref> (Yen et al. 1995) </ref>. The hybrid of the simplex method and the genetic algorithm applies the simplex method to the top S chromosomes in the GA population to produce S N children. The top N chromosomes are copied to the next generation. <p> Figure 3 depicts the reproduction stage of the hybrid approach. Empirical results obtained by applying the hybrid method to a subset of the biomodeling problem showed that the hybrid method outperformed the GA in terms of the speed of convergence and the quality of solution <ref> (Yen et al. 1995) </ref>. Metabolic Modeling The Proposed Modeling Strategy The proposed modeling strategy treats the system at two levels: a component (molecular) level such as enzyme reactions, protein-protein interactions and protein-DNA binding, and a system level such as metabolic networks, signal transduction pathways, genetic regulation systems, and global responses. <p> In the two remaining section, we focus our discussion on the component level modeling. A more detailed discussion on our system level modeling approach can be found in <ref> (Yen et al. 1995) </ref>. Mechanistic Modeling of Enzyme Kinetics In this section, we introduce four types of mechanisms and the structure of their corresponding mathematical models derived from the mechanisms. Since enzymes form complexes with their substrates, the rate of reaction is limited by the concentration of enzyme-substrate complex.

Reference-contexts: This is accomplished using fuzzy sets, which were developed by Lofti A. Zadeh to allow objects to take partial membership in a vague concept (i.e., a concept without sharp boundaries) <ref> (Zadeh 1965) </ref>. The degree to which an object belongs to a fuzzy set, which is a real number between 0 and 1, is called the membership value in the set.

Reference-contexts: CoA represents acetyl-coA, and denotes the membership value in the fuzzy sets. Based on fuzzy set theory, fuzzy logic generalizes modus ponens in classical logic to allow a conclusion to be drawn from a fuzzy if-then rule even when the rule's condition is partially satisfied <ref> (Zadeh 1973) </ref>. The strength of the conclusion is calculated based on the degree to which the antecedent is satisfied by the input data. Conclusions from multiple fuzzy rules are then combined to form a global conclusion. This is the essence of the interpolative reasoning.
