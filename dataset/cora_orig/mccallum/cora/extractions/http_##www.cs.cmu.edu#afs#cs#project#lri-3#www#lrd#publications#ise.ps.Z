Reference-contexts: Our research on position estimation techniques have concentrated on understanding and filtering sensors such as gyros and inclinometers, using sensor fusion to reduce uncertainty, and developing some novel techniques that involve skyline navigation and Sun tracking <ref> [1] </ref>. The lessons learned to date are informing our next round of development and experimentation. We plan to demonstrate safeguarded teleoperation of up to 10 km this year, while increasing the complexity of the terrain traversed and the amount of time delay introduced in operating the rover.

Reference-contexts: One promising, near-term scenario is to land a pair of rovers on the Moon, and to engage in a multi-year, 1000 kilometer traverse of historic sights, including Apollo 11, Surveyor 5, Ranger 8, Apollo 17 and Lunokhod 2 <ref> [2] </ref>. In this scenario, one of the rovers would be driven, returning continuous live video, while the other rover remains stationary, to provide high-resolution imagery of the surroundings and to serve as a communications link with Earth for both rovers.

Reference-contexts: We then describe the software system developed to drive the rover, and our experimental results. Finally, we address work that is still needed to fulfill the promise to return to the Moon in this millennium. The Ratler While we are currently designing a new lunar rover <ref> [3] </ref>, we are using a vehicle designed and built by Sandia National Laboratories [6] as a testbed to develop the remote driving techniques needed for a lunar mission.

Reference-contexts: All these methods help to produce elevation maps that accurately reect the actual surrounding terrain, with only a few centimeters of error. Obstacle Avoidance Planner To decide where it is safe to drive, we have adapted techniques developed in ARPAs Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) program for cross-country navigation <ref> [4] </ref>. The basic idea is to evaluate the hazards along a discrete number of paths (corresponding to a set of steering commands) that the rover could possibly follow in the next few seconds of travel.

IARP Workshop on Robotics In Space, </booktitle> <address> Montreal, Canada, </address> <month> July </month> <year> 1994. </year>
Reference-contexts: The idea is to provide a more exible mode of user interaction, one that reduces the probability of operator fatigue and mistakes that could be damaging to the rover. We have also focused on the problem of estimating the rovers position <ref> [5] </ref>. This is important in any mission scenario, but particularly one, such as the one described above, that involves long-distance navigation to find particular sites.

The Ratler (Robotic All-Terrain Lunar Exploration Rover) is a battery-powered, four-wheeled, skid-steered vehicle, about 1.2 meters long and wide, with 50 cm diameter wheels (Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: The stereo images are first rectified to ensure that the scan lines of the image are the epipolar lines <ref> [7] </ref>. The best disparity match, within a given window, is then computed using a normalized correlation. Disparity resolution is increased by interpolating the correlation values of the two closest disparities. <p> Interprocess communication and task sequencing is performed by the Task Control Architecture (TCA). TCA is a general-purpose architecture for mobile robots that provides support for distributed communication via sockets, task decomposition and scheduling, resource management, execution monitoring, and error recovery <ref> [7] </ref>. TCA-based systems consist of a number of distributed, concurrent processes that communicate via coarse-grained message passing. TCA connects processes, routes messages, and coordinates overall control and data ow.
