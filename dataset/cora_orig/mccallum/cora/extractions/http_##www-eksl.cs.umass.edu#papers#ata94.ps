Abstract: Monitoring is the process by which agents assess their environments. Most AI applications rely on periodic monitoring, but for a large class of problems this is inefficient. The interval reduction monitoring strategy is better. It also appears in humans and artificial agents when they are given the same set of monitoring problems. We implemented two genetic algorithms to evolve monitoring strategies and a dynamic programming algorithm to find an optimum strategy. We also developed a simple mathematical model of monitoring. We tested all these strategies in simulations, and we tested human strategies in a "video game." Interval reduction always emerged. Environmental factors such as error and monitoring costs had the same qualitative effects on the strategies, irrespective of their genesis. Interval reduction appears to be a general monitoring strategy.

Reference-contexts: This cost was also the fitness measure used by the genetic algorithm. The rest of the genetic algorithm was very basic, too. It used roulette wheel selection, fixed mutation and crossing over rates, and a population size typically around 100 <ref> [1] </ref>. mon's strategies have been tested with results shown in Table 1. Until now we have described rather abstract one-dimensional monitoring problems. ltb is a genetic programming algorithm that evolves monitoring strategies for simulated robots in two-dimensional worlds.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, in this experiment and others, involving hundreds of trials with ltb and other genetic programming approaches to two-dimensional cupcake problems <ref> [2, 3] </ref> we have never observed a fitter strategy than interval reduction. 8 Discussion Given the opportunity, adults and genetic algorithms will use interval reduction to solve cupcake problems. Dynamic programming tells us that interval reduction is optimal.

Reference-contexts: We have always had considerable difficulties getting ltb to consistently evolve monitoring strategies, even when the environment was designed in such a way that monitoring strategies were favored with higher fitness values <ref> [3] </ref>. The results of this experiment are shown in Table 1. Most data are two numbers: first, the mean number of monitoring events in a trial, and second, the mean cost of a trial. <p> Nevertheless, in this experiment and others, involving hundreds of trials with ltb and other genetic programming approaches to two-dimensional cupcake problems <ref> [2, 3] </ref> we have never observed a fitter strategy than interval reduction. 8 Discussion Given the opportunity, adults and genetic algorithms will use interval reduction to solve cupcake problems. Dynamic programming tells us that interval reduction is optimal.

Reference-contexts: interval reduction strategy lends further support to our belief that interval reduction might be very general; that is, we expect it to evolve in other agents in similar environments. 2 The Cupcake Problem In 1985, Ceci and Bronfenbrenner described a monitoring task for children that they called the cupcake problem <ref> [4] </ref>. Each child was instructed by an older sibling (who served as a confederate in the experiment and collected the data) as follows: "We are going to put some cupcakes in the oven and they will be done in thirty minutes.

Crossing over simply swaps two chunks of code between two individuals; mutation changes one command into another. Since the language is relatively simple, only a few constraints are needed to keep programs legal.

Reference-contexts: In the first case monitoring obviously isn't free, and in the second it is bad design if the dedicated processor learns anything from its monitoring about the system's goals. Norman and Bobrow <ref> [20] </ref> show convincingly that distributed systems can avoid catastrophic failure if they adopt the principle of continuously available output, in effect sharing intermediate results among components.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately the tradeoff between monitoring costs and penalties can be played out at every place the agent might stop to monitor. In fact, deciding when to monitor is a sequential decision problem <ref> [24] </ref>. Finding an optimal control policy is also a sequential decision problem. Actions can have delayed effects that must be considered in choosing the action to take in each state, and a policy that chooses actions solely for their immediate effects may not be optimal over the long term.
