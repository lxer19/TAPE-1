Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Geometric probing <ref> [CY87, Ski88, LR89, BS91, Kar91] </ref> is the subarea of computational geometry that investigates how to determine an object or some property of an object using a measuring device called a probe. Geometric probing problems are specified by several different parameters [Ski88, Ski89].

Reference-contexts: That is, a point probe takes as input a point in Euclidean space, and it returns + (positive) if the point is inside the object being probed or (negative) if it is outside. This type of probe was developed independently by Romanik [RS90a, RS90b] and Mitchell <ref> [Mit90] </ref>. Here we use the model defined by Romanik, which is defined formally in Section 2 below. This model was used by Romanik and Salzberg [RS92] for obtaining results on testing orthogonal shapes.

Reference-contexts: If the test polygon can have three vertices more than the target polygon, then verification with any finite number of test points is impossible. Previous work by Romanik <ref> [Rom92] </ref> using this model provided a testing scheme using 7n points for polygons with no three collinear vertices.

This model was used by Romanik and Salzberg <ref> [RS92] </ref> for obtaining results on testing orthogonal shapes. Note that in this model exact verification cannot be done since we assume infinite precision and we assume that a point probe does not return information about whether it is on the boundary of an object.
