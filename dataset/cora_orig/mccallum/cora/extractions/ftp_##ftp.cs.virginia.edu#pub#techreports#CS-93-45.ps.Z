Note: 4. Conclusions  
Abstract: 4 errors, and a control time of 85 ms covers all two-packet gaps. Further extensions allow recovery of multiple-packet errors. Since the control time for S-ARQ is directly linked with the packet size used by the voice protocol, larger packet sizes will decrease the effectiveness of the S-ARQ scheme for a fixed end-to-end delay bound. Conversely, shorter packets increase the effectiveness of S-ARQ. The S-ARQ scheme is attractive for a number of reasons. First, the S-ARQ scheme does not preclude the use of preventive error control methods such as FEC, and may be used in conjunction with preventive error control. Secondly, it is not network architecture specific (as is channel coding) nor does it require hardware support (as does FEC in high-speed environments). Finally, mechanisms to implement the S-ARQ scheme can be easily incorporated into existing voice packet protocols with little protocol overhead. This is important since packet loss is typically rare, and the gain in quality due to occasional recovery of lost packets must necessarily be balanced against the additional system complexity and any service degradation in the common case of error-free transmissions. Our continuing research is focused on using the insights gained from developing S-ARQ for packet voice protocols to develop delay-sensitive retransmission schemes for other continuous media applications. During the transfer of image sequences, for example, one common buffering strategy is to overlap the processing of an image with the network transfer of the following image [6]. This technique leads to a natural window of time in which retransmissions are useful, and the framework fits well with the notion of delay-sensitive retransmission schemes. We are also assessing the feasibility of S-ARQ and similar techniques across different network environments. The results from [1] are encouraging for the application of our new error control scheme to continuous media communication across future wide-area Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks. In the wide-area ATM environment, high-speed links and switches will keep network delays low while the statistical multiplexing of cells in switches will cause delay jitter and cell loss. Since the concept of delay-sensitive retransmission is not tied to a particular protocol layer, incorporation of these ideas at the ATM adaptation layer is an open research issue. [1] Dempsey, B., J.
