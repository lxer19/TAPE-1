Title: HETEROGENEOUS DECOMPOSITION AND INTER-LEVEL COUPLING FOR COMBINED MODELING

Abstract: Combined methods for modeling in simulation involve an integration of different model types. Often, discrete event methods are combined with continuous modeling techniques to model a complex environment that does not yield to formal description with only one model type. It is essential that, when defining a method for combined modeling, the coupling and decomposition methods are well defined. We demonstrate with an example model of boiling water that combined modeling is just a special case of using a heterogeneous approach to model composition. Using the heterogeneous approach provides a rich modeling environment where highly complex systems containing many distinct phases and multiple models can be conveniently represented.

Reference-contexts: A dataflow model, on the other hand, focuses on the transfer function between input and output. We define our most abstract model of boiling water using an FSA shown in figure 4. 4.2 Heterogeneous Model Refinement Homogeneous model refinement <ref> (Fishwick and Zei-gler 1991) </ref> is the process of refining models of the same type. For instance, we might represent the boiling water system using a hierarchy of finite state automata instead of the single level shown in fig. 4. We will limit our discussion in this paper to heterogeneous refinement.
