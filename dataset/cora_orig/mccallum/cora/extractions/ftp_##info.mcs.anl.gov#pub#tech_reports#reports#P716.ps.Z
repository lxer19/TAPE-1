Title: Time-Stepping for Three-Dimensional Rigid Body Dynamics  
Author: Mihai Anitescu Florian A. Potra David E. Stewart 
Date: April 3, 1998  
Abstract: Traditional methods for simulating rigid body dynamics involve determining the current contact arrangement (e.g., each contact is either a "rolling" or "sliding" contact). this approach is most clearly seen in the work of and Pfeiffer and Glocker. However, there has been a controversy about the status of rigid body problems in the area that do not famous, if not the earliest example is due Recently, a number of time-stepping methods have been developed to overcome this difficulty. These time-stepping methods use integrals of the forces over forces. separate newest of these methods are developed in terms of complementarity problems. time-stepping procedure simulating rigid body dynamics with friction. Proof of the existence of solutions to the continuous problem can be measure differential inclusions methods. There are, however, a number of limitations with the methods. In this paper several variants will be discussed and their essential properties proven.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently, a number of new methods have been developed for solving problems in rigid body dynamics that are explicitly based on a time-stepping formulation of the problem <ref> [4, 33, 36, 38, 39, 55, 56] </ref>. <p> New modifications have been developed recently that avoid this approximation, for which existence results for the time-stepping scheme can be proven [45]. 2. All collisions are perfectly inelastic (i.e. no bounce). One scheme that incorporates elastic and partly elastic collisions while preserving the dissipativity property is reported in <ref> [4] </ref>. This scheme splits the step into "compression" and "expansion" phases. Because this scheme is developed in terms of the generalized forces, it is a "Poisson"-style scheme. Other schemes can be developed in terms of the velocities without splitting the step; these are "Newton"-style schemes. 3. <p> The model can be modified to handle equality constraints (joints) in a way that does not affect either the solvability of the mixed linear complementarity problem or the upper bounds on the norm of the resulting velocities <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> The basic formulation presented in this section is for inelastic impact. It is based on the formulations of Stewart and Trinkle [55, 56] and Anitescu and Potra <ref> [4] </ref>. Work on the convergence theory of related formulations of rigid body dynamics can be found in Stewart [52, 53]. <p> However, reversibility of the tangential impulse is usually insignificant, unless the materials involved are highly elastic (as is the case for the so-called superballs, [47]). Solvability of the mixed linear complementarity problems is guaranteed for (27) and (28) <ref> [4, 55] </ref>. Therefore, a v + will be available at the end of the collision resolution. However, simple examples show that the model (27-28) will not necessarily produce the right energy balance when several contacts are involved. <p> However, simple examples show that the model (27-28) will not necessarily produce the right energy balance when several contacts are involved. The fact that the kinetic energy will not increase after the collision, 1 2 v M v , can be proven only for very special cases <ref> [4, 47] </ref>. In particular, if friction is present, then the kinetic energy has been proved to be nonincreasing only if * N = * T , which is a very unlikely particular case. <p> Under the assumption that the collision is exactly detected when multiple contacts are involved it can be proved that (1 + * N )v c * N v is a part of a feasible point of (28) that satisfies the energy balance <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: One of the most time-intensive aspects of multibody dynamics problems with large numbers of bodies is collision detection. While this topic is beyond the scope of this article, it is an important issue and has been extensively discussed in the robotics, graphics, and computational geometry literature. (See, for example, <ref> [10, 25, 35] </ref>.) These algorithms can be used with the above formulation to produce fast algorithms for rigid body simulations. 2.5 Equality Constraints Equality constraints can also be incorporated into the above formulation (7). This can be done by using Lagrange multipliers as (generalized) forces.

Reference-contexts: The quantity l+1 is not in itself a physical quantity, although it is usually equal to kD T v l+1 k 1 , which represents the sliding velocity at the contact. Note that if M (q) is constant, then (7) can be reduced to a linear complementarity problem (LCP) <ref> [11] </ref> in (c l+1 n ; fi l+1 ; l+1 ) by substituting for v l+1 in terms of c l+1 n and fi l+1 . <p> It can be shown in the case of constant M (q) that the matrix for the reduced LCP is copositive <ref> [11, pp. 176-184] </ref>, and from this, that solutions for (7) exist and can be found using Lemke's algorithm [11, pp. 265-288]. The conditions of (7) can be interpreted physically.

The conditions of (7) can be interpreted physically. The first line is simply a discrete approximation to the equations of motion. The second line is the contact condition: no contact force unless there is contact at the end of the time-interval. <p> n ; b fi; q) = 0: 10 While the original time-stepping scheme (7) is a linear complementarity problem (LCP) for constant M (q), the new formulation is a highly nonlinear mixed complementarity problem. 3.1 Theoretical Issues The nonlinearity of the mixed complementarity problem (22) means that linear complementarity theory <ref> [11] </ref> cannot be applied. Instead, a homotopy argument is used in [45] to show that solutions exist for problems of the same type as (22). <p> As for (7), the matrix of this LCP is copositive, and solutions can be found by using Lemke's algorithm <ref> [11, p. 176ff, p. 265ff] </ref>. The theoretical properties of this generalization follow those of (7). The only additional practical considerations for using, for example, quaternions, to represent orientation is that drift may lead to jqj significantly different from one.

Reference-contexts: One of the most time-intensive aspects of multibody dynamics problems with large numbers of bodies is collision detection. While this topic is beyond the scope of this article, it is an important issue and has been extensively discussed in the robotics, graphics, and computational geometry literature. (See, for example, <ref> [10, 25, 35] </ref>.) These algorithms can be used with the above formulation to produce fast algorithms for rigid body simulations. 2.5 Equality Constraints Equality constraints can also be incorporated into the above formulation (7). This can be done by using Lagrange multipliers as (generalized) forces.

Reference-contexts: The variations in the time-stepping methods considered include the following: 1. Friction cones (the set of generalized contact forces for a given configuration) are approximated by polyhedral cones. New modifications have been developed recently that avoid this approximation, for which existence results for the time-stepping scheme can be proven <ref> [45] </ref>. 2. All collisions are perfectly inelastic (i.e. no bounce). One scheme that incorporates elastic and partly elastic collisions while preserving the dissipativity property is reported in [4]. This scheme splits the step into "compression" and "expansion" phases. <p> They tend to favor particular directions. 3. They tend to require a large number of variables (fi l+1 i , for i = 1; 2; : : : ; p) to accurately represent the friction force. 9 Recently, some new techniques of Pang and Stewart <ref> [45] </ref> allow the use of general convex friction cones.

Reference-contexts: These methods contrast with the more traditional approaches, which involve formulating a system of equations, or complementarity problem, at each time-step to be solved for the forces, which are then used as input for a differential equations or differential-algebraic equations (DAE's) solver <ref> [22, 23, 30, 31, 32, 47] </ref>. The problem with the traditional approaches is that the systems of equations or complementarity problems to be solved at each instant in time may not have a solution. This difficulty relates directly to problems that do not appear to have solutions, discovered by P. <p> Under this hypothesis, the impact has two phases. In the first phase, compression, interpenetration is prevented by normal compression contact impulses. In the second phase, decompression, a fraction * N of each normal compression contact impulse is restituted to the system (Poisson hypothesis, <ref> [47] </ref>). The quantity * N is called (normal) restitution coefficient and may be different for any contact active during a certain collision, if multiple contacts are involved. Each of these phases is considered instantaneous, and only the velocity of the system but not its position, can change during the collision. <p> A more sophisticated model could assume that the tangential impulse is partly reversible <ref> [47] </ref> and the restituted impulse is I r = * N c c n + * T D (q) fi c , where * T is the tangential restitution coefficient. <p> However, reversibility of the tangential impulse is usually insignificant, unless the materials involved are highly elastic (as is the case for the so-called superballs, <ref> [47] </ref>). Solvability of the mixed linear complementarity problems is guaranteed for (27) and (28) [4, 55]. Therefore, a v + will be available at the end of the collision resolution. <p> However, simple examples show that the model (27-28) will not necessarily produce the right energy balance when several contacts are involved. The fact that the kinetic energy will not increase after the collision, 1 2 v M v , can be proven only for very special cases <ref> [4, 47] </ref>. In particular, if friction is present, then the kinetic energy has been proved to be nonincreasing only if * N = * T , which is a very unlikely particular case.

Reference-contexts: If there are no unilateral contacts (i.e., the only constraints are equality constraints), then the system can be regarded as a differential algebraic equation (DAE) of index three. Constrained mechanical systems have been often discussed from the point of view of differential algebraic equations <ref> [5, 8, 9, 14, 46, 48, 58] </ref>.
