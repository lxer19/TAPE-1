Abstract: We report our work on FDDI based networks for multimedia applications. It lifts previous research limitations and shows a systematic way for bounding message delays at the application level. The synchronous server is designed to control application admissions and properly multiplex messages from multiple applications on one node. We consider an integrated system including both the sender and receiver hosts, and the network. A set of constraints are proposed for controlling application admissions and guaranteeing the normal operation of the integrated system so that the total message delays can be bounded.
