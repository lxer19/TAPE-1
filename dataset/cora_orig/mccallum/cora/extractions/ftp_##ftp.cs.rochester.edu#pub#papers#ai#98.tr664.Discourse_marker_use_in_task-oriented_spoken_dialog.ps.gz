Abstract: Discourse markers, also known as clue words, are used extensively in human-human task-oriented dialogs to signal the structure of the discourse. Previous work showed their importance in monologs and social conversations for marking discourse structure, but little attention has been paid to their importance in spoken dialog systems. This paper investigates what discourse markers signal about the upcoming speech, and when they tend to be used in task-oriented dialog. We demonstrate that there is a high correlation between specific discourse markers and specific conversational moves, between discourse marker use and adjacency pairs, and between discourse markers and the speaker's orientation to information presented in the prior turn. We limit our analysis to turn-initial discourse markers and discover new patterns in their interaction with phenomena specific to dialog. 1 1 A shorter version of this paper appears in the proceedings of Eurospeech-97.[BH97]

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Discourse markers are a linguistic devise used at the beginning of an utterance to signal its relationship to the current discourse state [GS86; Rei85; Sch87]. They are words or phrases with the sole function of indicating structure vs. content <ref> [Coh84] </ref>. For instance, discourse markers can be used to mark changes in the global discourse structure, as exemplified by `by the way' to mark the start of a digression and `anyway' to mark the return from one. In human-human task-oriented dialogs, discourse markers abound. <p> In addition, their work treats discourse markers as a class and does not present enough information about specific discourse markers for system builders to make use of. Among the influential works analyzing discourse marker use in spoken language, Cohen <ref> [Coh84] </ref>, working with argument monologs, showed that clue words cut processing time of the hearer in recognizing coherent transmissions. She demonstrated that using clue words allows the hearer to recognize transmissions that would have otherwise been incoherent without the inclusion of the clue word.

Reference-contexts: While contributing information, each participant watches for clues from his partner that indicate whether his turn was understood. Both sides of this behavior (signaling and attending) are called grounding <ref> [CS89] </ref>. Grounding is used to demonstrate that the listener thinks he understands both what his partner meant by the prior contribution and how it ties in with the previous discourse. <p> The same set of TRAINS dialogs were annotated using 6 strength levels of grounding evidence described below, and taken from <ref> [CS89] </ref>. The grounding level does not take into account any initial discourse markers. Strength of Grounding Evidence Level 0 The first turn in a dialog (which has nothing to ground) and filled pauses.

Reference-contexts: Prior work on discourse marker functioning in text has revealed that clue words are valuable in determining the rhetorical structure of a text [Mar97] and also that they set up expectations about upcoming speech acts <ref> [CW97] </ref>.

Work by [MM95; EMP97] has focused on learning the correct placement of clue words to make generated tutorial descriptions more coherent and natural.

Reference-contexts: The listener implicitly communicates grounding of the prior utterance if an opportunity to initiate a repair is not taken. Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs <ref> [CWG86] </ref> demonstrated that task-oriented dialogs typically require stronger evidence of grounding than casual discourse. Task-oriented dialog involves a collaboration between two conversational agents. This collaboration is necessary to ensure that the agents maintain a coordinated set of beliefs about the current state of the dialog and of the task space.

Shorter works contributed by Pomerantz [Pom75], Owen [Owe81], Davidson <ref> [Dav84] </ref>, Heritage [Her84], and Schiffrin [Sch85] also discuss specific discourse marker behavior. Their findings are incorporated below in the discussions of specific discourse markers. Only four discourse markers occurred frequently enough in the annotated TRAINS dialogs to merit analysis. They are `and', `so', `well', and `oh'. <p> In these uses of `well', he found the utterance always conveyed a notion of incompleteness, inappropriateness, or insufficiency. Davidson <ref> [Dav84] </ref> observed that in the case of invitations and offers, `well' may be both used and taken as the preface to a rejection. Owen [Owe81] presents an analysis similar to ours of `well's role as the second pair-part of adjacency pairs.

Previous work on discourse marker use in task-oriented dialogs found that they play a role in anaphora resolution by signaling changes in the attentional state of the discourse <ref> [GS86] </ref>. Unfortunately, this influential research did not discuss the function of specific discourse markers, such as `well', found in the TRAINS corpus. Prior work that is more like the research reported here analyzes the behavior of specific discourse markers in social conversations, accompanied by corpus-based analysis and examples. <p> In other words, `and' can be used to signal shifts in intentional state, a la Grosz and Sidner <ref> [GS86] </ref>. Oh: Heritage [Her84] summarizes the function of `oh' as "used to propose that its producer has undergone some kind of change in his or her locally current state 4 of knowledge, information, orientation, or awareness". Heritage disproved the opinion of prior researchers that `oh' was merely a backchannel.

Their findings are incorporated below in the discussions of specific discourse markers. Only four discourse markers occurred frequently enough in the annotated TRAINS dialogs to merit analysis. <p> They are `and', `so', `well', and `oh'. Below we discuss analysis presented in prior work of the discourse function of these discourse markers. In the next section we will discuss whether their use in the TRAINS93 corpus agrees with that analysis. And: Schiffrin <ref> [Sch87] </ref> identifies the set of "discourse connectives" including `and', `but' and `or'. Their syntactic role as conjunctions is related to their discourse function. <p> Turns beginning with `Oh' Prior work suggests that a speaker employs `oh' to mark that he has undergone a change in his current state of knowledge, information, orientation, or awareness [Her84]. `Oh' can mark a self-initiated repair, or it can come after clarification, correction, or a response to a question <ref> [Sch87] </ref>. <p> that began with `well' can be classified as corrections, of either the plan or the other person's beliefs. 9 Turns beginning with `And' `And' is used extensively in turn-initial position in the TRAINS dialogs, and other researchers have found `and' to be the most frequently-occurring discourse marker in their corpora <ref> [Sch87; Mar97] </ref>. As Schiffrin's analysis predicts, `and' is used primarily to mark that the current utterance is a continuation of the same speaker's prior turn. `And' also correlates strongly, though not absolutely, with presenting new information. <p> from dialog d93-17.2 points out how difficult it can sometimes be to tell the 10 Turns beginning with `So' `So' is traditionally said to mark main idea units, such as the return to a main level after a clarification sub-dialog or to bring a higher-level context space back into focus <ref> [Sch87] </ref>. In the TRAINS corpus, `so' turns provide conclusions, summaries, or restatements. <p> The first thing we noticed is that the discourse markers on the whole do not correlate strongly with particular speech acts, as they did with conversational moves. This result is corroborated by Schiffrin's <ref> [Sch87] </ref> corpus analysis, in which she concluded that turn-initiators reveal little about the surface construction of the upcoming turn, so we should not expect discourse markers to be correlated with the surface form of the utterance. <p> This behavior makes sense in light of the discussion above of `and's role to signal that the current turn is a continuation of the same speaker's prior turn. `And' usually only marks grounding in the sense of appropriate next contribution. Schiffrin <ref> [Sch87] </ref> discovered that using `and' actually makes a claim that the speaker does not wish to cooperate with a potential topic shift introduced by the other speaker's intervening turn. Turn-initial `and' sends a strong signal that the current turn continues to build on information from the same speaker's prior speech.
