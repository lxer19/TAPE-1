Title: Preconditioning complex-symmetric layered systems arising in electrical power modeling (draft) (extended abstract)  
Author: Victoria E. Howle Stephen A. Vavasis 
Date: January 15, 1998  
Abstract: We consider the problem of solving linear systems arising in AC electrical power networks. These linear systems are complex and symmetric (but not self-adjoint). They can be highly ill-conditioned when a network with faults (short ciruits or open circuits) is modeled. We address this ill-conditioning by rewriting the system in an augmented layered format. Even in this format, convergence is still slow because the spectrum of a graph adjacency matrix is spread out. We address this second kind of ill-conditioning by extending the support-tree preconditioner of Gremban, Miller and Zagha to handle layered linear systems. Preliminary computational experiments using preconditioned QMR are reported.

Reference-contexts: The diagonal matrix D stores admittances (reciprocal impedances) of the loads, b holds the generator voltages, and x is the vector of node voltages. When the network is faulty, e.g., a near short-circuit or near open-circuit exists in transmission lines, D is ill-conditioned. See Bergen <ref> [1] </ref> for more information about modeling AC networks.

Reference-contexts: This ill-conditioning means that convergence of a simple iterative method (say QMR) applied directly to (1) may be slow. Even worse, the iteration could well converge to the wrong solution, even after an arbitrary number of iterations, as demonstrated by Bobrovnikova and Vavasis <ref> [2] </ref>. This latter problem cannot be fixed with a preconditioner. <p> We address this difficulty using the same approach as <ref> [2] </ref>, namely, we rewrite the linear system in layered form. Let the arcs of the graph, which correspond to diagonal entries of D, be numbered 1; : : : ; m. Assume that there are two classes of arcs, low impedance (functioning wires) and high impedance (nearly open circults). <p> The ill-conditioning in D thus translates to the inequality ffi 1 ffi 2 . With this new notation, (1) is rewritten ffi 1 A T 2 D 2 A 2 x = ffi 1 A T 2 D 2 b 2 : (2) As in <ref> [2] </ref>, let us introduce a new variable v such that A T 1 D 1 A 1 x A T Note that this equation always has a solution v because the right-hand side is in the range of A T 1 . <p> The MINRES-L algorithm of <ref> [2] </ref> would solve this linear system using MINRES. In [2] it was assumed that D was real and positive definite hence 3 MINRES applied. In our AC power network setting, we instead apply QMR [3] to (5). <p> The MINRES-L algorithm of <ref> [2] </ref> would solve this linear system using MINRES.

Note that QMR on a complex symmetric system is twice as efficient as plain QMR [4]. 3 Preconditioning The theory and computational experiments in <ref> [2] </ref> show that applying an iterative method to (5) yields much better accuracy in the final answer than working directly with (1). These results can be generalized to the complex weighted case. This topic is not considered further for space reasons. <p> These results can be generalized to the complex weighted case. This topic is not considered further for space reasons. Instead we now turn to the matter of the convergence rate of the iterative solver. The MINRES-L algorithm of <ref> [2] </ref> suffered from very slow convergence, and the problem is further exacerbated in the complex case. The main reason is that the underlying matrices A T 1 D 1 A 1 and A 2 D 2 A 2 can be ill-conditioned. <p> We see from the figure that the first iterative method converges rapidly but to a low-accuracy solution. The second method converges very slowly, but the theory of <ref> [2] </ref> predicts that it will eventually converge to a high-accuracy solution. Finally, the method proposed here converges rapidly and to full precision.

Reference-contexts: For example, if the underlying graph is an n-node path, the condition number of A T A is fi (n 2 ). We call A T DA a weighted Laplacian. An interesting preconditioner called the support-tree preconditioner was proposed by Gremban, Miller and Zagha <ref> [5] </ref>. Let A T DA be a weighted Laplacian. (Gremban et al. consider the case of positive real weights but the construction is easily generalized to complex weights with positive real parts). First, one forms a separator tree of the underlying graph.
