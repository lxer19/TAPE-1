Abstract: As part of the development of knowledge sharing technology, it is necessary to consider a variety of domains and tasks in order to ensure that the shared framework is widely applicable. This paper describes an ontology design project in experimental molecular biology, focusing on extensions to previous ontological models and frame-based formalisms that allow us to handle problems in the representation of experimental science knowledge. We define object histories , which are used to track substances through a series of experimental processes, including those which transform their participants from one category to another. We define object and process complexes - temporary configurations with features of their own. We present extensions to a frame-based formalism to support these features. Additional features of our frame formalism include slot groups for identifying sets of relations with common properties, and partial filler restrictions that combine knowledge of the most likely slot values with the ability to handle unexpected values. We demonstrate how these extensions enable the use of (relatively) domain independent inference rules, support intelligent information retrieval, and improve the quality of query interfaces; and we describe the translation of our formalism into Ontolingua.

Reference-contexts: Object histories in our model trace substances through category conversions as well as other processes. Some work in description logic explores the idea of extending frame-based formalisms for more elaborate description of possible slot-fillers (see, for example, <ref> (Brachman et al. 1991) </ref> ). We believe that our approach simplifies these specifications as compared to, say, CLASSIC, at the same time allowing for the richness of open-value sets to assist in natural-language processing and to account for evolving domains.

We took a standard frame-based forma lism (see, for example, (Minsky 1981) or <ref> (Chaudhri et al. 1997) </ref>) as a basis and then extended it. So, each frame consists of a category name, a super-category name, and a list of slots and slot groups (slot groups are introduced and described below).

Reference-contexts: Translation to Ontolingua To validate the formality and portability of our formalism, we translated the ontology into Ontolingua <ref> (Farquhar, Fikes, and Rice 1996) </ref> which has become a standard repository for ontologies for knowledge sharing. As described above, Ontolingua supports a frame-based formalism, and, thus, it lends itself easily as a translation target for our formalism.

Reference-contexts: Introduction The field of ontology development has become very active in recent years on the premise that it will encourage and enable knowledge sharing and reuse <ref> (Fikes et al. 1991) </ref>. It is generally accepted that building an ontology for any real-world domain is a difficult task, and this task could be greatly facilitated if it were possible to reuse and modify ontologies created by others.

Reference-contexts: Our solution to this problem is introducing Object Histories. The idea of histories was suggested in <ref> (Hayes 1990) </ref> and is used in Qualitative Physics (Collins and Forbus 1987; Forbus 1984) . However, it is generally assumed that objects do not change their category or identity.
