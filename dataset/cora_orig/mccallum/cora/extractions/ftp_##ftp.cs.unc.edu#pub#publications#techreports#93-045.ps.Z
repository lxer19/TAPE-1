Abstract: Optical distortion is one of the optical aberrations of optical systems that do not affect image sharpness. Thus, it can be beneficial to correct optical distortion computationally rather than optically. Computational correction versus optical correction will generally yields lighter optical systems. This is of great importance for head-mounted displays where the weight of the viewer needs to be minimized for efficient performance, safety, and optimum duration of usage. We shall describe in this paper, one method of computational correction that consists in warping polygon vertices. It is the case, however, that the algorithms given can be easily rewritten to handle pixels rather than vertices warpings.

Reference-contexts: The values computed can then be stored in a file and be loaded into the table for D -1 when needed. Another method is to solve the cubic polynomial D in closed form - 7 - for R i , when R v equal R <ref> (Beyer, 1984) </ref>. This closed form solution can then be used to compute the lookup table values. This is the method we have adopted and that we shall now describe.

Reference-contexts: The displacement of the ray is referred as the transverse ray aberration. Most often, the specified location for the ray in the image plane is that inferred from the first-order or paraxial laws of image formation <ref> (Longhurst, 1973) </ref>. Some first-order properties that will be relevant later on in this paper are the focal length and the FOV of the optical system.

Reference-contexts: In order to generate a pair of stereoscopic images for the two display devices in the HMD, the display software must take into account the relative positions of the head tracker, the display devices, the optics, and the users eyes <ref> (Robinett and Rolland, 1992) </ref>.

This diagram and its associated nomenclature is discussed in more detail in <ref> (Robinett and Holloway, 1992, 1993) </ref>. <p> For the LEEP optics, as the LCD screen is moved outward to approach the LEEP focal point, the virtual image goes to infinity <ref> (Figure 11, Robinett & Rolland, 1992) </ref>. However, the angles at which image points are seen changes very little as the magnification changes. A common source of error in implementing a distortion-correction function is to overlook the importance of the video overscan defined earlier.

Reference-contexts: Although it not the subject of this paper, it could be computationally corrected for, if desired. The authors are not aware at this time, however, of any optical system designed with uncompensated lateral chromatism that was then corrected for computationally <ref> (Weisman,1992) </ref>. Optical distortion is the change in transverse magnification as a function of the off-axis distance of an object point in the FOV and is the subject of this paper.
