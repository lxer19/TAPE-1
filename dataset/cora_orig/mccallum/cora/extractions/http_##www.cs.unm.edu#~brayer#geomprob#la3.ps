Abstract: This chapter develops the notion of transforming one vector into another. A transformation is an abstract entity, analogous to a vector. An important class of transformations can be represented as matrices once basis vectors are specified. In general systems theory, the behavior of a system is frequently described in terms of a vector in a linear vector space. The relationship between input functions, the system state and the system output can be expressed conveniently in terms of transformations. Generally the words, mapping, function and operator are synonymous with the word transformation. Definition 1.1 Let X and Y be linear vector spaces (not necessarily distinct) which are defined over the same field, F . If for each vector, x 2 X , there is associated, according to some rule, a vector, y 2 Y, then that rule defines a mapping of x to y. The mapping rule is called a transformation (or mapping or operator or function). The relationship is expressed The spaces X and Y are called the domain and codomain of A respectively. y = A(x) is called the image of x. And x is called the preimage of y. The set of all images of x 2 X is called the range of A. In general, A maps X into Y, but if the range of A, R(A) = Y, then we say A maps X onto Y. The transformation, A is said to be one-to-one if x 1 6= x 2 ) A(x 1 ) 6= A(x 2 )
