Abstract: Standard Web search services, though useful, are far from ideal. There are over a dozen different search services currently in existence, each with a unique interface and a database covering a different portion of the Web. As a result, users are forced to repeatedly try and retry their queries across different services. Furthermore, the services return many responses that are irrelevant, outdated, or unavailable, forcing the user to manually sift through the responses searching for useful information. This paper presents the MetaCrawler, a fielded Web service that represents the next level up in the information "food chain." The MetaCrawler provides a single, central interface for Web document searching. Upon receiving a query, the MetaCrawler posts the query to multiple search services in parallel, collates the returned references, and loads those references to verify their existence and to ensure that they contain relevant information. The MetaCrawler is sufficiently lightweight to reside on a user's machine, which facilitates customization, privacy, sophisticated filtering of references, and more. The MetaCrawler also serves as a tool for comparison of diverse search services. Using the MetaCrawler's data, we present a "Consumer Reports" evaluation of six Web search services: Galaxy[5], InfoSeek[1], Lycos[15], Open Text[20], WebCrawler[22], and Yahoo[9]. In addition, we also report on the most commonly submitted queries to the MetaCrawler. This paper appears in the Proceedings of the 1995 World Wide Web Conference

Reference-contexts: Perhaps the most widely distributed is CUSI [18], the Configurable Unified Search Index, which is a large form which allows users to select one service at a time and query that service. There are also several other services much like CUSI, such as the All-in-One Search Page <ref> [2] </ref>, or W3 Search Engine list [19]. Unfortunately, while the user has many services on these lists to choose from, there is no parallelism or collation.

Reference-contexts: The closest work to the MetaCrawler is SavvySearch <ref> [3] </ref>, an independently created multi-threaded search service released in May 1995. SavvySearch has a larger repertoire of search services, although some are not WWW resource services, such as Roget's Thesaurus. SavvySearch's main focus is categorizing users' queries, and sending them to the most appropriate subset of its known services [4].

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, while the user has many services on these lists to choose from, there is no parallelism or collation. The user must submit queries to each service individually, although this task is made easier by having form interfaces to the various services on one page. The Harvest system <ref> [6] </ref> has many similarities to the MetaCrawler; however, rather than using existing databases as they are and post-processing the information returned, Harvest uses "Gatherers" to index information and "Brokers" to provide different interfaces to extract this information.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Web search services such as Lycos and WebCrawler have proven both useful and popular. As the Web grows, the number and variety of search services is increasing as well. Examples include: the Yahoo "net directory"; the Harvest home page search service <ref> [7] </ref>; the Query By Image Content service [12]; the Virtual Tourist [24], a directory organized by geographic regions; and more. Since each service provides an incomplete snapshot of the Web, users are forced to try and retry their queries across different indices until they find appropriate responses.

Reference-contexts: Another advantage of the MetaCrawler is that it does not depend upon the implementation or existence of any one search service. Some indexing mechanism is necessary for the Web. Typically, this is done using automated robots or spiders, which may not necessarily be the best choice <ref> [13] </ref>. However, the underlying architecture of the search services used by the MetaCrawler is unimportant. As long as there is no central complete search service and several partial search services exist, the MetaCrawler can provide the benefit of accessing them simultaneously and collating the results.

Reference-contexts: Organizations may choose to have an institutional MetaCrawler with enhanced caching capabilities, on the presumption that people within an organization will want to examine many of the same pages. The cache could also facilitate local annotations, creating a collaborative filtering and information exchange environment of the sort described elsewhere <ref> [17] </ref>. Finally, while our prototype MetaCrawler depends on the good will of the underlying services, a MetaCrawler client would not. In the future, an underlying service may choose to block MetaCrawler requests, which are easily identified.

In our early designs, we focused on syntax for queries with several additional options for improving the result. This syntax was similar to InfoSeek's query syntax: parentheses were used to define phrases, a plus sign designated a required word, and a minus designated a non-desired word.
