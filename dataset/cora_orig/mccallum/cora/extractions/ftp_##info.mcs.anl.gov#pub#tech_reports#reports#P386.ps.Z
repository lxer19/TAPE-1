Reference-contexts: Our methods for finding a single identity for the theory of TBAs are interesting from two distinct points of view. First, from the algebraic, since TBAs enjoy both permutable and distributive congruences, they admit a single ternary polynomial p (x; y; z), the so-called Pixley polynomial <ref> [1, p. 405] </ref>. We first find such a polynomial p (x; y; z) and use a technique of R. Padmanabhan and R. W. Quackenbush [7] to construct a single identity for the equational theory in question. This is done in Section 2.

Reference-contexts: These operations were originally studied by A. A. Grau <ref> [2] </ref>. By the equational theory of TBAs we mean the study of the set of all equational identities satisfied by f and g in all Boolean algebras. In this paper, we show that the equational theory of TBAs is one-based. <p> Finally, we show that g (g (y)) = y. Let x = g (y) in (3). We have y = f (g (y); g (g (y)); y) = f (y; g (y); g (g (y))) = g (g (y)). Thus, by A. A. Grau <ref> [2] </ref>, we have obtained all the necessary identities for TBAs. Let (5) be the dual of (3), namely, f (x; g (y); y) = x;(5) which, of course, is a consequence of f (1), (2), (3)g.

Reference-contexts: Then, with each of the candidate identities, we ran a separate Otter search, trying to prove it to be a single identity. The strategy for these Otter searches was the following: 2 use a search based on the Knuth-Bendix completion procedure <ref> [3] </ref>; discard equalities with more than 40 symbols; use (1), (2), and (3) as goals; and search for 60 seconds. Two of the candidates, one with 26 symbols and the other with 38 symbols, derived all three goals. (7) has 34 symbols.

To write such an identity, we simply follow the technique given in <ref> [7, p. 376] </ref>; the identity (8) of Theorem 2 of that paper is the desired one: p (p (u; u; x); p (w; y; z); z) = x;(6) where the word w (z; a; b; c; d; e) = p (z; s (a; b; c; d; e); t (a; b; c;

Reference-contexts: Contrast this with the theory of Boolean groups (i.e., groups of exponent 2) with additional operators: given a natural number n, there exists an equational theory B (n) containing a reduct of Boolean groups which is n based but not n 1 based (see Theorem 2 of <ref> [8] </ref> for an actual construction of such equational theories). The same situation is true for the theory of all groups as well; this was announced without proof in [9].
