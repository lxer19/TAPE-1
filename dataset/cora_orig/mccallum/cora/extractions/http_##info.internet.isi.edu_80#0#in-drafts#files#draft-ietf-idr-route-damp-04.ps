Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress." Abstract A usage of the BGP routing protocol is described which is capable of reducing the routing traffic passed on to routing peers and therefore the load on these peers without adversely affecting route convergence time for relatively stable routes. This technique has been implemented in commercial products supporting BGP. The technique is also applicable to IDRP.

Reference-contexts: In practice, fixed timers have been set to very short time intervals and have proven useful to pack routes into a smaller number of updates when routes arrive in separate updates. The BGP protocol refers to this as packing Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) <ref> [5] </ref>. Seldom are fixed timers set to the tens of minutes to hours that would be necessary to actually damp route flap. To do so would produce the undesirable effect of severely limiting routing convergence. 2.1 Existing Fixed Timer Recommendations BGP-3 does not make specific recommendations in this area [1]. <p> BGP4 retains the "Frequency of Route Advertisement" section and adds a "Frequency of Route Origination" section. BGP-4 describes a method of limiting route advertisement involving a fixed (configurable) MinRouteAdvertisementInterval timer and fixed MinASOriginationInterval timer <ref> [5] </ref>. The recommended timer values of MinRouteAdvertisementInterval is 30 seconds and MinASOrigi nationInterval is 15 seconds. 2.2 Desirable Properties of Damping Algorithms Before describing damping algorithms the objectives need to be clearly defined. Some key properties are examined to clarify the design rationale.
