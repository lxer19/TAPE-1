Abstract: A multimedia ATM network is shared by media streams with different performance requirements. For media streams such as file transfers, the preservation of bursts and the provision of guarantees for loss probability at the burst level is of primary importance, while, for media streams such as voice, loss guarantees at the cell level are sufficient. Continuous media have stringent delay jitter requirements. Finally, some applications require loss-free transmission. In this paper the first complete traffic management scheme for multimedia ATM networks is introduced. The traffic management scheme supports four different classes of traffic, each of which has different performance requirements expressed in terms of delay jitter guarantees and cell or burst level loss guarantees. Its running time specification as well as its real time admission control algorithms are completely specified.

Reference-contexts: This problem has been studied in [2, 15, 11]. An ATM network should also support efficiently VCs requiring performance guarantees at the cell level. The estimation of cell-loss probability for networks using statistical multiplexing is one of the most studied problems in the ATM literature <ref> [10, 8, 13, 6, 5, 1] </ref>. In order to calculate the cell-loss probability, it is necessary to calculate the steady-state occupancy of the buffer, obtain the probability of buffer overflow, and relate it to the loss probability of each VC.

Reference-contexts: Losing a number of cells of a burst may result in the loss of the information content of the whole burst. Therefore, an ATM network should support VCs requesting QoS guarantees with respect to the burst-loss probability. This problem has been studied in <ref> [2, 15, 11] </ref>. An ATM network should also support efficiently VCs requiring performance guarantees at the cell level. The estimation of cell-loss probability for networks using statistical multiplexing is one of the most studied problems in the ATM literature [10, 8, 13, 6, 5, 1].

Reference-contexts: The source traffic characteristics do change, however, as a result of the buffering performed at each switch. The change can result in the total alteration of the initial structure of the stream <ref> [3, 7, 17] </ref> which in turn might invalidate the results of the CAC algorithm for downstream nodes. <p> Proposed solutions for the prevention of the alteration of the traffic characteristics of a VC are based either on the reconstruction of the initial structure at every node through dedicated hardware mechanisms <ref> [3] </ref> or on the restriction of the change of traffic characteristics through the use of framing [7]. This paper proposes a new traffic management scheme (TMS) that supports four different types of service with various types of QoS guarantees (Table 1). <p> The mean rate can be policed through the use of a leaky bucket proposed in [14] at the input to the network. For policing the peak rate, a cell-spacer proposed in <ref> [3] </ref> can be used. Note that because of the framing strategy, the rates r; r L and r H will not be violated as the stream goes through the network, so it is sufficient to police the peak rate at the entrance to the network.

With the bufferless model, whenever the instantaneous cumulative rate exceeds the link rate, the excess rate is lost. On the other hand, the buffer can accommodate any contention due to simultaneous arrivals of cells from different streams.

First, the traffic characteristics and QoS requirements of a particular VC must be related to its framing strategy. Second, the framing introduces a discretization of possible rates of operation of a source. <p> This second drawback is explained further in Section 3. The first of these problems is the dominant source of inefficiency, but the second can also become important, especially for small frame sizes. In this paper a CAC algorithm is introduced, based on the framing strategy proposed in <ref> [7] </ref>, but enhanced through the successful solution of both of the above mentioned problems. 3.
