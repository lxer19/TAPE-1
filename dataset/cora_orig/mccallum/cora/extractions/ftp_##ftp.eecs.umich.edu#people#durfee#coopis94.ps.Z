Abstract: Cooperative information agents need mechanisms that enable them to work together effectively while solving common problems. We investigate the use of commitment by agents to proposed actions as a mechanism that allow agents to work concurrently on interdependent problems. Judicious use of commitment can not only increase the throughput of cooperative information systems, but also allow them to deal flexibly with dynamically changing environments. We use the domain of distributed scheduling to demonstrate that static commitment strategies are ineffective. Results from simulated experiments are used to identify the environ mental features on which an adaptive commitment strategy should be predicated.

Reference-contexts: In fact, it has been shown that commitment can be used even by non-cooperative (antagonistic) agents to gain advantage in hostile negotiations [8, 3]. In cooperative settings, however, reciprocal commitments enable quicker convergence in multiagent negotiations when compared to unilateral commitments. Cohen and Levesque <ref> [1] </ref> have developed the semantics associated with committing to a particular set of actions. Jennings [4], on the other hand, emphasizes the centrality of commitment in coordinating multiple agents. The latter work also concerns the use of conventions as a guide to reasoning when agents fail to honor their commitments.

Reference-contexts: The different concurrently active processes, forked by managers of different resources required by a task, negotiate using the multistage negotiation protocol <ref> [2] </ref>. Each scheduling agent manages the calendar accesses by the different processes it has forked. We do not concern ourselves with concurrency control mechanisms, assuming the availability of standard database or file access control mechanisms [7, 5].

Reference-contexts: Each scheduling agent manages the calendar accesses by the different processes it has forked. We do not concern ourselves with concurrency control mechanisms, assuming the availability of standard database or file access control mechanisms <ref> [7, 5] </ref>. A given task t i is scheduled through negotiation by jA i j processes, one for each of the resources required for the task. The process created by the agent managing the jth resource to schedule task i is referred to as T ij .

Reference-contexts: This necessitates a thorough investigation of different heuristic strategies for commitment that an automated agent can use. It is necessary that we clarify what we mean by the term commitment. We assume the following definition of the term <ref> [6] </ref>: Definition: Commitment is an agreement or pledge to do something in the future. An agent can make such a pledge to itself, or to another agent. In this paper, we will concern ourselves with the decision regarding whether or not to commit to proposed times to schedule an activity.

Reference-contexts: We assume a dynamic environment where tasks arrive over time. This problem is more difficult than the static scheduling problem where all tasks are available before processing starts <ref> [11] </ref>. Furthermore, we require the same task be processed using multiple resources to be acquired from different sources.
