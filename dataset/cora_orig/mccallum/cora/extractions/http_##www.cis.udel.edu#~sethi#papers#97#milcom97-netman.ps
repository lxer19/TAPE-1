Abstract: Effective management of battlefield networks requires a hierarchical network management architecture wherein managers can dyanmically delegate management tasks to intermediate managers. In this paper we describe a novel paradigm called the spreadsheet paradigm which extends the traditional flat SNMP management model to a hierarchical architecture. We present a spreadsheet MIB, language, and event model that is located at an intermediate manager controllable by a manager. The spreadsheet-based scripting environment presents an easy to use and comprehend abstraction and interface to extend a standard management framework. We are applying this framework to problems in the management of tactical battlefield networks.

Reference-contexts: To effectively manage large distributed systems and complex internetworks, a management model must go beyond the traditional flat model of a single manager communicating with a large number of agents. Hierarchical management and peer-to-peer communication among managers are attractive alternatives that need to be explored for distributed system management <ref> [1] </ref>. The need for hierarchical management is particularly acute in tactical battlefield networks which are expected to have tens of thousands of nodes.

Reference-contexts: Although currently mainly monitoring functions have been identified, the management structure will likely grow to include control functionality as well. Unfortunately, the most popular management frame 1 work in use today, the SNMP framework (which includes both the SNMP and the SNMPv2 protocols) <ref> [2] </ref>, [3], [4], only supports the flat management model. The framework provides no means for managers to delegate tasks to intermediate managers or for peer-to-peer communication between intermediate managers during the execution of these tasks.

Reference-contexts: The FBCB2 management strategy uses SNMP since it is based on the Internet protocol suite and is therefore limited by these weaknesses of SNMP. Management by delegation is a well-known strategy <ref> [5] </ref>, [6] for implementing hierarchical management, but so far the SNMP community has been unable to take advantage of it because the delegation primitives have not been integrated with the SNMP framework.

Reference-contexts: The interpreter performs the functions of syntax checking, run time error checking, detection and reporting. A language that targets a network management environment must be able to support features that facilitate the specification of network management tasks coupled with user flexibility and expressive power <ref> [11] </ref>. The SSL has been specially designed for this purpose. The SSL supports arithmetic operators that allow a user to perform expression evaluation. It further allows a user to specify numeric (dot notation) or symbolic form of managed objects.
