Title: Billing Users and Pricing for TCP

Abstract: This paper presents a system for billing users for their TCP traffic. This is achieved by postponing the establishment of connections while the user is contacted, verifying in a secure way that they are prepared to pay. By presenting the user with cost and price information, the system can be used for cost recovery and to encourage efficient use of network resources. The system requires no changes to existing protocols or applications and can be used to recover costs between cooperating sites. Statistics collected from a four day trace of traffic between the University of Califor-nia, Berkeley and the rest of the Internet demonstrate that such a billing system is practical and introduces acceptable latency. An implementation based on the BayBridge prototype router is described. Our study also indicates that pricing schemes may be used to control network congestion either by rescheduling time-insensitive traffic to a less expensive time of the day, or by smoothing packet transfers to reduce traffic peaks.

Reference-contexts: The user may only want to pay for traffic as long as the price for the connection stays below a specified threshold. This would allow the implementation of a time-varying threshold pricing policy agreed upon by the user and policed by the BGW <ref> [8] </ref>. If during the life of the connection any of the limits or thresholds are exceeded, the BGW contacts the user before forwarding any more messages.

Reference-contexts: We consider everything on the other side of this router to be the "outside world." 4 3 During the month of September 1994, Berkeley contributed the 13th largest amount of WAN traffic to the NSFNET out of over 22,000 registered networks <ref> [12] </ref>. 4 This definition of "outside world" includes some geographically and topologically nearby sites such as Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories.
