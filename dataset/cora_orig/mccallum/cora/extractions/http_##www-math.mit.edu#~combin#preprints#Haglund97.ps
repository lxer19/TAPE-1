Title: q-ROOK POLYNOMIALS AND MATRICES OVER FINITE FIELDS  
Author: James Haglund 
Date: October 1, 1997  
Abstract: Connections between q-rook polynomials and matrices over finite fields are exploited to derive a new statistic for Garsia and Remmel's q-hit polynomial. Both this new statistic mat and another statistic for the q-hit polynomial ~ recently introduced by Dworkin are shown to induce different multiset Mahonian permutation statistics for any Ferrers board. In addition, for the triangular boards they are shown to generate different families of Euler-Mahonian statistics. For these boards the ~ family includes Denert's statistic den, and gives a new proof of Foata and Zeilberger's Theorem that (exc; den) is equi-distributed with (des; maj). The mat family appears to be new. A proof is also given that the q-hit polynomials are symmetric and unimodal.

Reference-contexts: No positive answer to this question has ever been found. Joni and Rota [JoRo] showed how the study of vector spaces over finite fields with restricted bases is relevant to this problem. Later Chen and Rota <ref> [ChRo] </ref> proved that if you require a q-analog to have a certain interpretation in terms of automorphisms with prescribed behavior, then a solution is possible only for a few types of boards. There are interesting similarities between, but no obvious overlap with, some of their results and ours.

Reference-contexts: For example, the permutation = 2313212 has 3 excedences, occurring in the first, second, and fourth places of , and so exc () = 3. Not many Euler-Mahonian pairs are known. A general overview of the few that have been discovered can be found in <ref> [CSZ] </ref>. There the authors classify a solution to the equation X exc ()=k q statx () = X des ()=k as a "proper" Euler-Mahonian pair, proper indicating that exc 6= des. <p> Hence the ~ and mat families are fundamentally different, at least with respect to the simple transformations we have considered here. In addition none of the sixteen pairs are equal to maj, and are also unequal to the statistic mak as described in <ref> [CSZ] </ref> (the pair (des; mak) is known to be Euler-Mahonian [FoZe]). We can also make use of (15) and (16) to try and generate other Euler-Mahonian pairs. However, examples indicate that the pairs arrived at in this manner are rearrangements of the sixteen pairs above.

Reference-contexts: Using the geometry of the board, it is simple to convert one of our Euler-Mahonian pairs (des; stat) into a solution to (4). When this conversion is applied to the ~ family, we get Denert's statistic den <ref> [Den] </ref>, and a new proof of a result of Foata and Zeilberger [FoZe], that (exc; den) is equi-distributed with (des; maj). On the other hand, the mat family gives what appears to be a fundamentally new solution to (4).

Some of our Euler-Mahonian statistics can easily be rephrased as a multiset solution to (4). <p> In the late 1980's M. Denert introduced an interesting permutation statistic which arose during her research into algebraic number theory. She conjectured that this statistic was Euler-Mahonian when paired with exc. Her conjecture was proven by Foata and Zeilberger <ref> [FoZe] </ref>, who named her statistic "Denert's statistic", denoted by den. We now show that den is part of the ~ family. It will prove convenient to work with B (n) c and (16). <p> Now directly from the board we have #O = i &gt;i X i i #XO = #f1 i &lt; j n; i j &lt; j g + #f1 i &lt; j n; j i &gt; j g: The formula for #XO above equals den () <ref> [FoZe, p.33] </ref> and the formula for #O simplifies to n fi exc (), so we get and the joint distribution of (exc; den) with (des; maj) follows from (16) and the symmetry of the LHS of (13).

Reference-contexts: A F errers board is a board with the property that (i; j) 2 B =) (k; p) 2 B for 1 k i and j p n. Garsia and Remmel <ref> [GaRe] </ref> introduced the following q-rook polynomial; R k (B) := C where the sum is over all placements C of k non-attacking rooks on the squares of the Ferrers board B. Non-attacking means no two rooks are in the same column, and no two are in the same row. <p> Let ffi be the linear operator such that ffix k := [k]x k1 for k 2 Z; for any formal power series F (x), ffiF (x) = F (xq) F (x) : Lemma 3. (This appears in <ref> [GaRe] </ref>). <p> The rest of the proof is precisely as in <ref> [GaRe] </ref>. Assume Area (B) &gt; 0, and that Theorem 6 is true for all boards of smaller Area than B. We now show that B can be obtained from a board of smaller Area by a sequence of RAISE, FLIP, or ADD operations, and Theorem 6 follows by induction.
