Abstract: Security issues are the major roadblock currently preventing greater access to databases over the Internet. In this paper we propose a framework for secure access to databases by a wide audience over the Internet, using World Wide Web information servers, a modified version of the NCSA Mosaic Internet browser, and role wrappers (software modules that assign roles to incoming database requests, based on the credentials submitted with the request). We also describe an application embodying this framework.

Reference-contexts: The server can then invoke a form-specific script which processes the form, encapsulating and accessing back-end databases as needed. The output of the script will be displayed to the user. Standard browsers for the Web, such as the very popular NCSA Mosaic <ref> [1] </ref>, guarantee that users can access many different databases and other resources using a single consistent form-based interface.

The secure HTTP protocol allows the Web server to determine what security protocol is being used for each request.
