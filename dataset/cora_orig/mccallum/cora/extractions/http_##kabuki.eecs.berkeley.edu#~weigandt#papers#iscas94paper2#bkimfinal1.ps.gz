Abstract: This paper presents an analytical model for timing jitter accumulation in ring-oscillator based phase-locked-loops (PLL). The timing jitter of the system is shown to depend on the jitter in the ring-oscillator and an accumulation factor which is inversely proportional to the bandwidth of the phase-locked-loop. Further analysis shows that for delay-locked-loops (DLL), which use an inverter delay chain that is not configured as a ring-oscillator, there is no noise enhancement since noise jitter events do not contribute to the starting point of the next clock cycle. Finally, theoretical predictions for overall jitter are compared to behavioral simulations with good agreement.

Reference-contexts: A single phase jump at time nT can be represented by (EQ 4) in the z-domain. (EQ 4) Here the magnitude of the error step is Dt n . The variance of this error is shown in <ref> [1] </ref> to be proportional to the number of stages in the ring-oscillator, and the timing jitter variance contributed by each stage. <p> This phase jitter is assumed white and its variance is proportional to the value of 2N (Dt 1 ) 2 determined for a given ring-oscillator design using the results of <ref> [1] </ref>. The jitter is normalized to the period of the delay in order to determine the phase noise variance. <p> The jitter for this case can be calculated using (EQ 14) and is a function of the jitter contribution per stage (Dt 1 ), the number of taps in the oscillator (N), and the PLL accumulation factor ( ). In <ref> [1] </ref>, it is shown that for the circuit parameters used in the delay cells in [5], the jitter contribution per cell was Dt 1 =2.09ps. <p> This agrees well with the experimental result in [5], which was not measured exactly, but determined to be somewhere in the range of 50-100 ps. IV. Conclusion This analysis has shown that, including the results of <ref> [1] </ref>, the jitter in a ring-oscillator is proportional to three factors; the number of stages, the jitter contribution per stage, and a PLL accumulation factor , which is inversely proportional to the square-root of the bandwidth of the PLL.

Reference-contexts: Previously, more attention has been paid to the first effect than the second, but both are important for high performance clock recovery applications. So for both clock synthesis and clock recovery applications, a thorough analysis of the output jitter due to the internal jitter sources is important <ref> [2] </ref>. To find the accumulated rms jitter, a PLL which uses a sequential phase detector and a charge-pumping circuit is represented by a simple discrete-time model as shown in Figure 1 [3]. <p> Figure 6 shows the output jitter for the same time period. This simulation shows that DLL does not accumulate jitter and performs better for the internal jitter sources such as delay cell jitter. In this case, parameter values are taken from <ref> [2] </ref> and given as C = 0.039 mF, K d = 8.4/2p mA, K P = 2p rads/volts and T = 50 nsec. For a rough experimental verification, this model for timing jitter was compared to the jitter observed in the ring-oscillator PLL described in [5].

Reference-contexts: To find the accumulated rms jitter, a PLL which uses a sequential phase detector and a charge-pumping circuit is represented by a simple discrete-time model as shown in Figure 1 <ref> [3] </ref>. The transfer function for jitter in the PLL due to the internal jitter sources is represented by (EQ 1) in z-transform domain. (EQ 1) Here the phase detector gain, and VCO gain, respectively, and I S indicates the charge pumping current. <p> The accumulation factor a is inversely proportional to the square-root of K d K w aT and in this case shows little dependency on C I and C P . Therefore, as long as , and stability requirements are met <ref> [3] </ref>, the jitter accumulation factor can be lowered by increasing the bandwidth of the loop filter, . An alternative scheme for clock synthesis is to use a delay-locked-loop (DLL) [4].

Reference-contexts: Therefore, as long as , and stability requirements are met [3], the jitter accumulation factor can be lowered by increasing the bandwidth of the loop filter, . An alternative scheme for clock synthesis is to use a delay-locked-loop (DLL) <ref> [4] </ref>. In this case, the reference clock is fed to the input of the delay line, and the rising edge of the output of the delay line is compared to that of the reference clock.

Reference-contexts: For a rough experimental verification, this model for timing jitter was compared to the jitter observed in the ring-oscillator PLL described in <ref> [5] </ref>. This PLL was fabricated in a 2 mm CMOS technology and the ring-oscillator was comprised of 16 inverter delay stages running at a frequency of 30-MHz. <p> In [1], it is shown that for the circuit parameters used in the delay cells in <ref> [5] </ref>, the jitter contribution per cell was Dt 1 =2.09ps. The parameters for the PLL in this design were K d = 20/2p mA, K w = 2p x 5 MHz/volt, R = 200 W, and T = 33 nsec, giving a jitter accumulation factor of 38.9. <p> Therefore, the r.m.s. timing jitter for this PLL, is predicted by (EQ 14) to be 81.30 ps. This agrees well with the experimental result in <ref> [5] </ref>, which was not measured exactly, but determined to be somewhere in the range of 50-100 ps. IV.

Reference-contexts: If a phase noise source is applied to a PLL with design parameters K d = 8.4/2p mA, K w = 2p x 20 MHz/volt, R = 90W and T = 50 nsec (same parameters as in <ref> [6] </ref>), then the total PLL jitter is shown in the unit variance input source. In this example the predicted accumulation factor is 25.7 and for a unit variance input noise, should yield a total PLL jitter of around 25.7.
