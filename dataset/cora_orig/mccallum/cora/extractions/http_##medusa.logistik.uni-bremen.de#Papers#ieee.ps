Abstract: The application of adaptive optimization strategies to scheduling in manufacturing systems has recently become a research topic of broad interest. Population based approaches to scheduling predominantly treat static data models, whereas real-world scheduling tends to be a dynamic problem. This paper briefly outlines the application of a genetic algorithm to the dynamic job shop problem arising in production scheduling. First we sketch a genetic algorithm which can handle release times of jobs. In a second step a preceding simulation method is used to improve the performance of the algorithm. Finally the job shop is regarded as a nondeterministic optimization problem arising from the occurrence of job releases. Temporal Decomposition leads to a scheduling control that interweaves both simulation in time and genetic search.

Reference-contexts: The main difficulty in this subject arises from the question of how to represent the problem in the algorithm, which is known to be most important for successful genetic search. In <ref> [1] </ref> we have formulated a generalized permutation approach to this question. The approach is based on a representation of solutions to a job shop problem given by a string of all covered tasks.

Reference-contexts: by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (Project Parnet) 1 2 Dynamic Model of the Job shop The standard model of job shop scheduling refers to a set of machines and a set of jobs where each job is split into a number of operations that have to be processed by dedicated machines <ref> [2] </ref>. All processing times of operations are known in advance and considered as tasks on machines. While several assumptions concerning the way of processing tasks by machines are made (e.g. no preemption of operations) a schedule has to be found that optimizes a certain measure of performance.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, currently local hill-climbing procedures do not fit to the needs of measures such as the mean job flow time F . Nevertheless, the performance of the algorithm can be improved by using a problem specific heuristic like the Gi*er&Thompson algorithm for schedule building <ref> [3] </ref>. In contrast to left-shifted scheduling it sometimes reorganizes operation sequences of machines without violating technological constraints.

Reference-contexts: We use a generalized order-crossover technique in order to generate valid new strings from two parental strings. The schedule representation and its genetic operator have been validated on a large suite of static job shop benchmarks <ref> [4] </ref>. In order to give a rough idea about the quality achieved, we confine to the two most famous problems of Muth and Thompson (1963).

Reference-contexts: Therefore we use it for computations reported in section 5. 3 4 Temporal Decomposition of a Nondeterministic Job Shop In order to apply the PGA to nondeterministic job shop problems we follow an approach proposed by Raman et al. <ref> [5] </ref>. It decomposes the nondeterministic problem into a sequence of determined dynamic problems. Let P 0 be the dynamic job shop defined in section 2 that arises from a production program at time t 0 = 0.

Reference-contexts: A common but still promising way out comes from hybrid population based search by problem specific heuristics or more general hill climbing methods. For dynamic scheduling temporal decomposition opens a way towards treating real world applications <ref> [6] </ref>. Temporal decomposition can give us some insight into the levels of solution quality reached by simulation methods. To dominate this level by only a few percent is already a nice perspective.

Reference-contexts: This feature should be introduced by heuristics competing with simulation. 3 Adaptive Scheduling in a Deterministic Job Shop Since 1985 when Davis started to treat job shop problems with genetic algorithms, plentiful research in the field of adaptive production scheduling has been proposed, for an overview see <ref> [7] </ref>. The main difficulty in this subject arises from the question of how to represent the problem in the algorithm, which is known to be most important for successful genetic search. In [1] we have formulated a generalized permutation approach to this question.

Reference-contexts: From the viewpoint of combinatorics the question of how to sequence and schedule tasks in such a system looks rather complex and is known to be NP -hard to almost every state <ref> [8] </ref>. That is why research in production planning and control of dynamic manufacturing systems has mainly focused on simulation methods, using priority-rules for task allocation. This paper examines whether the results obtained by priority-rule based simulation can be outperformed by genetic algorithms.
