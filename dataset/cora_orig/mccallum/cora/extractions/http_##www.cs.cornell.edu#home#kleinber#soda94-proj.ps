Title: Chapter 1 Comparing Point Sets Under Projection  
Author: Daniel P. Huttenlocher Jon M. Kleinberg 
Abstract: We say that two sets of n points in the plane, P and Q, are views of the same object when there exists a set of n points S &lt; 3 and two distinct planes A and B, such that P is the projection of S onto A and Q is the projection of S onto B. In the case of orthographic projection, we provide an O(n 3 ) algorithm for deciding whether P and Q are views of the same object. For central projection we provide an O(n 7 ) algorithm. In both cases, the running times are a quadratic factor better than naive methods. We also show how randomization can be used to improve the expected running time by a factor of O(n= log n) when the largest subsets of P and Q that "match" are some fixed fraction of the total size of the sets.

Reference-contexts: While there have been a number of investigations of geometric algorithms for pattern recognition (e.g., <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>) the objects of study have been configurations, such as sets of points in the plane, rather than projections of configurations as we study here. <p> What are the corresponding bounds for comparing point sets under projection? It would also be interesting to provide an algorithm that handles uncertainty, such as when the locations of points are known only approximately (as in <ref> [1] </ref>). A related problem is that of deciding whether two given point sets S; T &lt; 3 can produce the same projection into &lt; 2 .

Reference-contexts: As we are concerned with the projections of point sets onto a line, the underlying combinatorial structure is that of the circular sequence (cf. <ref> [4] </ref>, chapter 2). For a point set P , the half-period of its circular sequence is the list of orderings of the points of ` (r P ), as P is rotated from = 0 to (where r denotes rotation about the origin by ).

Reference-contexts: Rather, when such an S exists it is only specified up to an affine transformation of &lt; 3 (this question of "reconstructing" point sets from two labelled views has been considered in <ref> [5] </ref>). As we are concerned with the projections of point sets onto a line, the underlying combinatorial structure is that of the circular sequence (cf. [4], chapter 2).
