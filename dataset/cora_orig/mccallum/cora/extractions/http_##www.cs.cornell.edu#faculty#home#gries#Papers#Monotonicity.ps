The purpose of Dijkstra's note [2] was to present a way of dealing with such non- true ranges. Dijsktra introduces the notion of "Range diffusion" for punctual functions and predicates and proves (13) using it.

Reference-contexts: Dijsktra introduces the notion of "Range diffusion" for punctual functions and predicates and proves (13) using it. Here, we present an alternative proof of (13), which rests on Theorem Witness (9.30) of <ref> [4] </ref> (square brackets denote universal quantification over the state space): Theorem Witness. Suppose ^x does not occur free in R , P , and Q .
