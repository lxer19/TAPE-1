Reference-contexts: Derivations in LJ ' are trees defined as usual. We formulate LJ ' as a system without the cut rule. It is not difficult to prove that cut is admissible in LJ ' using the general cut-elimination theorem given in Sazonov [33], Buss <ref> [1] </ref>, or Girard [14]. There are two major kinds of automated theorem proving methods based on the proof-search in sequent calculi: the tableau method and the inverse method. The inverse method tries to construct proofs in the direction from axioms to the goal.

Reference-contexts: The decidability of simultaneous rigid E-unification in the signatures with unary function symbols is an open problem (Degtyarev, Matiyasevich and Voronkov <ref> [3] </ref>). 2 We slightly changed the terminology compared to Gallier, Raatz and Snyder [13]. Our notion of a rigid equation corresponds to the notion of a rigid E-unification problem of [13]. <p> However, for intu-itionistic logic, there is a simple reduction of simultaneous rigid E-unifiability to the derivability problem, and hence handling of simultaneous rigid E-unification is inevitable for designing a complete procedure. In addition, some special cases of simultaneous rigid E-unification are decidable (see Degtyarev, Matiyasevich and Voronkov <ref> [3] </ref>) (for example, the function-free case is NP-complete) which allows one to use decision procedures for these fragments. 20 Andrei Voronkov.

However, our recent results on the undecidability of simultaneous rigid E-unification by Degtyarev and Voronkov [5, 6] show that this approach can hardly be an advantage over methods using most general unifiers. 6. Degtyarev and Voronkov <ref> [4, 7, 8] </ref> proposed a combination of two kinds of unification for matrix methods based on so-called equality elimination. This approach consists of using most general unifiers in the superposition rules and subset unification to close tableau branches (subset unifiability is NP-complete). <p> For classical logic, a number of methods not using simultaneous rigid E-unification have been developed. For methods based on sequent calculi, the equality elimination method has been developed by Degtyarev and Voronkov <ref> [4, 8, 9] </ref>. Recently, Degtyarev and Voronkov [11] proved that an incomplete but terminating procedure for rigid E-unification gives a complete procedure for classical logic with equality [11].

Reference-contexts: The early methods used saturation algorithms: substitutions of all possible (ground) terms for variables. The same effect is achieved by the use of the functional reflexivity axiom t't (Robinson and Wos [31], also Loveland [21] in the context of model elimination and Fitting <ref> [12] </ref> in the context of the tableau method) or by the functional substitutivity axioms: both axioms allow us to replace variables by arbitrary terms. This way of instantiation is applicable to arbitrary theorem proving procedures, for example resolution-based or tableau based procedures. 2.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we analyze the problem of variable instantiation in intuitionistic logic with equality. Our analysis shows close connections between the variable instantiation problem and simultaneous rigid E-unification introduced by Gallier, Raatz and Snyder <ref> [13] </ref>. Furthermore, our results imply that handling simultaneous rigid E-unification is unavoidable in automatic proof procedures for intuitionistic logic with equality. For classical logic, there are many methods of variable instantiation depending on the proof procedure.

Reference-contexts: To add equality to proof procedures for intuitionistic logic one has to develop algorithms for simultaneous rigid E-unifiability. No such algorithms are known yet, except for ones based on a straightforward enumeration (see Petermann <ref> [28] </ref>). Our results also show a fundamental difference between handling equality in proof procedures for classical and non-classical logics. For classical logic, a number of methods not using simultaneous rigid E-unification have been developed.

Reference-contexts: This system of rigid equations has an interesting property: we cannot find its solution using V-paramodulation of Chang and Lee [17] (later described as rigid paramodulation by Plaisted <ref> [29] </ref>) and most general solutions to the equations in the right-hand sides of ` 8 . Example 2.3 The system of two rigid equations h (x 1 )'a; h (x 2 )'a; h (a)'y ` 8 y'g (h (y)) has an infinite number of solutions. <p> Although simultaneous rigid E-unifiability is, in general, undecidable, its undecidability is only known for the case when the signature in which formulas are written contains binary function symbols (see proofs of the undecidability by Degtyarev and Voronkov [5, 6], Plaisted <ref> [29] </ref> and Veanes [36] for an overview of such proofs).

Reference-contexts: Resolution and paramodulation originally introduced by Robinson and Wos [31], or superposition use most-general unifiers to instantiate variables.

Reference-contexts: The main methods (in the chronological order) are the following. 1. The early methods used saturation algorithms: substitutions of all possible (ground) terms for variables. The same effect is achieved by the use of the functional reflexivity axiom t't (Robinson and Wos <ref> [31] </ref>, also Loveland [21] in the context of model elimination and Fitting [12] in the context of the tableau method) or by the functional substitutivity axioms: both axioms allow us to replace variables by arbitrary terms. <p> This method was characterized as minus-normalization by Matulis [24] and Maslov [23]. The applicability of minus-normalization has been demonstrated for proof procedures based on sequent calculi, but it can as well be applied to resolution- and paramodulation-based proof procedures. 3. Resolution and paramodulation originally introduced by Robinson and Wos <ref> [31] </ref>, or superposition use most-general unifiers to instantiate variables. However, most general unifiers have been shown useful only in indirect proof procedures: resolution and the inverse method (see Voronkov [38], Degtyarev and Voronkov [9]) 1 . 4.

Reference-contexts: Tammet [35] implemented a theorem prover for intuitionistic logic based on the inverse method. Currently, the prover does not have equality, but Tammet is going to include equality as well (private communication). Our results provide a basis for including equality in such provers. Sahlin, Franzen and Haridi <ref> [32] </ref> implemented a theorem prover for intuitionistic logic where a non-standard formalization of equality is used. For example, in their logical system the formula a'b c'd is provable. The results of our paper explain the (so far) unsuccessful attempts to incorporate equality in intuitionistic logic.

Reference-contexts: Derivations in LJ ' are trees defined as usual. We formulate LJ ' as a system without the cut rule. It is not difficult to prove that cut is admissible in LJ ' using the general cut-elimination theorem given in Sazonov <ref> [33] </ref>, Buss [1], or Girard [14]. There are two major kinds of automated theorem proving methods based on the proof-search in sequent calculi: the tableau method and the inverse method. The inverse method tries to construct proofs in the direction from axioms to the goal.

Reference-contexts: We did not give any concrete procedure for proof search modulo simultaneous rigid E-unification. In fact, it is easy to construct such a procedure using rules of our constraint calculus in the backward direction. Such procedures are standard in tableau-based theorem provers, see e.g. Shankar <ref> [34] </ref> or Lincoln and Shankar [20], with the exception that in presence of equality we cannot 1 A pseudo-prenex is a finite sequence of 8x i , 9x i and ::. 25 Section 6.

Reference-contexts: In view of this result, when we mention procedures or algorithms for simultaneous rigid E-unification, we mean semi-decision procedures or algorithms. A more precise formulation of the undecidability results is the following (see Veanes <ref> [36] </ref>): Theorem 2.5 Simultaneous rigid E-unifiability in the signature with one function symbol of arity 2 and at least one constant is undecidable. <p> Although simultaneous rigid E-unifiability is, in general, undecidable, its undecidability is only known for the case when the signature in which formulas are written contains binary function symbols (see proofs of the undecidability by Degtyarev and Voronkov [5, 6], Plaisted [29] and Veanes <ref> [36] </ref> for an overview of such proofs).
