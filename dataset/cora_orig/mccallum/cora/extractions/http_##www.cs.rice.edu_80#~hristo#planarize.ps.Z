Abstract: dgn) edges. This result is tight within a constant factor. Similar results are obtained for planarizing vertex sets and for graphs embedded on nonorientable surfaces. Planarizing edge and vertex sets can be found in O(n + g) time, if an embedding of G on a surface of genus g is given. We also construct an approximation algorithm that finds an O( p

Reference-contexts: A problem of this type is called a graph planarization problem. This problem has been intensively investigated in relation to its applications to circuit layout <ref> [21, 3, 24, 18] </ref>. One approach to the graph planarization problem is to construct a maximal planar subgraph of the input graph G. By solving the maximal planar subgraph problem one finds a minimal set of edges whose removal leaves a planar graph (called a planarizing set of edges).

Reference-contexts: If one can planarize a graph by removing o ( p gn) vertices or o ( p edges, then one can then find in the resulting planar graph a separator of O ( p n) vertices [20] or O ( dn) edges <ref> [4] </ref>, which will be a contradiction to the above lower bounds. For graphs embedded on nonorientable surfaces the tightness of our results follows from the tightness in the orientable case. Let G be any n-vertex graph of orientable genus g.

Reference-contexts: This is motivated by the fact that the problem of embedding a graph on a surface of minimum genus is known to be NP-hard [27].

In this paper we describe an approximation algorithm that finds an O ( p dgn log g) planarizing edge set that does not require a genus-g embedding to be given as an input. No comparable algorithm for this problem has been previously constructed. The paper is organized as follows.
