Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The effectiveness of client-based caching for very large distributed information systems (like the WWW) is limited. This was established in a comprehensive study of client-based caching for the Web, which was conducted by our Oceans group (http://www.cs.bu.edu/groups/oceans/). In that study <ref> [4] </ref>, the effectiveness of session caching, machine caching, and proxy caching were established using a unique set of 5,700 client traces (almost 600,000 URL requests), which were obtained by intrumenting Mosaic as detailed in [6]. <p> The results of our client-based caching study <ref> [4] </ref> suggest that for a single client, the temporal locality of reference is quite limited, especially for remote documents. <p> If client-based caching is done on a per-site basis (i.e., a common "proxy" cache is shared among all clients), then one would expect an improved cache performance as a result of the geographical locality of reference property. However, the results of our client-based caching study <ref> [4] </ref> suggest that for remote documents the amount of sharing between clients is limited. In particular, we found that even with an infinite proxy cache size, the average byte hit rate improves from 36% to 50%. Figure 1, which is reproduced from the data in [4] illustrates this point by plotting <p> of our client-based caching study <ref> [4] </ref> suggest that for remote documents the amount of sharing between clients is limited. In particular, we found that even with an infinite proxy cache size, the average byte hit rate improves from 36% to 50%. Figure 1, which is reproduced from the data in [4] illustrates this point by plotting the rate at which the proxy cache must be inflated|a measure termed the Cache Expansion Index (CEI)|to maintain a constant byte hit rate.

Reference-contexts: Another example of how our work complements other client-based protocols is related to the notion of dynamic server selection, introduced by Crovella and Carter in <ref> [5] </ref>. The primary purpose of a client 8 based dynamic server selection protocol is to determine "on the spot" which of several servers to use to retreive a document replicated on all of these servers.

Reference-contexts: Geographical locality of reference implies that an object accessed by a client is likely to be accessed again in the future by "nearby" clients. This property is similar to the processor locality of reference exhibited in parallel applications <ref> [8] </ref>. Spatial locality of reference implies that an object "neighboring" a recently accessed object is likely to be accessed in the future. Copyright 1996 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

Reference-contexts: Geographical locality of reference implies that an object accessed by a client is likely to be accessed again in the future by "nearby" clients. This property is similar to the processor locality of reference exhibited in parallel applications <ref> [8] </ref>. Spatial locality of reference implies that an object "neighboring" a recently accessed object is likely to be accessed in the future. Copyright 1996 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

Reference-contexts: This clustering could be based on several criteria. For example, it could be based on geographical information (e.g., distance in miles between clients as suggested in <ref> [10] </ref>). Alternately, it could be based on institutional/network boundaries (e.g., assign one service proxy per institution or network). Our choice was to base the clustering on the structure of the routes between a server and its clients.

Reference-contexts: The significance of these findings was further investigated by Gwertzman and Seltzer in the context of WWW cache consistency <ref> [11] </ref>. It is important to note that our measurements and observations apply to information systems of archival nature (e.g. institutional Web pages).

Reference-contexts: These traces are summarized in table 1. Unless otherwise stated, our model validation and trace simulations were all driven by this data. The highly uneven popularity of various Web documents has been documented in [6]. This study confirmed the applicability of Zipf's law [13, discussed in <ref> [12] </ref>] to Web documents. Zipf's law was originally applied to the relationship between a word's popularity in terms of rank and its frequency of use.
