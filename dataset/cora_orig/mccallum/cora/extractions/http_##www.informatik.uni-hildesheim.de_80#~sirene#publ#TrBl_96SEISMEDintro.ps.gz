Abstract: The efficiency of modern health care relies more and more upon a computerised infrastructure. Open distributed ITsystems have started to bring professionals together from all over the world. On the one hand easy processing and communication of images, sounds, and texts will help to represent and treat illnesses and diseases efficiently, on the other hand they may threaten the privacy of patients, and the accountability and professional secrecy of health care professionals. The European Union has initiated a multi disciplinary project to come up with practical guidelines how to achieve a Secure Environment for Information Systems in MEDicine (SEISMED). It has taken into account the traditional and proved principles of health care data processing, the various legislations within the EU, the enormous and subtle risks of health care ITsystems, and the cost of changing existing technology. Four Reference Centres in Europe have validated most of the guidelines.

Reference-contexts: The initial investment was quite modest at 20 MECU for projects that involved several member States of the European Community with funding on the basis of 50% of overheaded costs. At this stage 42 projects were funded to initiate this work <ref> [1] </ref>. At the same time the Commission established a group to explore the impacts of such work on the activities of Health Care and the future development of such work.

Reference-contexts: At this stage 42 projects were funded to initiate this work [1]. At the same time the Commission established a group to explore the impacts of such work on the activities of Health Care and the future development of such work. This group examined a number of issues <ref> [2] </ref> but, in particular, it appreciated for the first time that there were safety issues in terms of the utilisation of information systems in Health Care.

Reference-contexts: This led to the enunciation of the Six Safety First Principles for European Health Information Systems which placed safety as a key issue in the consideration of such systems <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: diagnosis and treatment of patients in such a fashion that errors in the information system, or indeed, the lack of access to such an information system for a period, might lead to unsatisfactory care and in the extreme case might damage or contribute to the premature death of a patient <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: first phase of the AIM programme, the European Parliament has expressed a definite interest in these issues and the AIM secretariat were able to participate with the relevant working group of the European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI WG2) in order to establish a very useful working conference during 1990 <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It arose from the amalgamation of two proposals which built upon the different strengths of each others partners. The work was concerned with the security of Health Care Establishments (HCEs) although this was set within the general context of security measures for information systems <ref> [6] </ref>. The Guidelines developed on these various areas of security have been validated by the SEISMED projects reference centres to a large extent.

Reference-contexts: The project presented major parts of its results to the scientific and standards community at the working conference Caring for health information of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Working Group 4 <ref> [9] </ref>. In order to achieve a broader discussion and awareness, SEISMED organized in July 1994 a European workshop on Towards Security in Medical Telematics: Legal and Technical Aspects [10], which attracted about 90 legal, medical, and IT-experts.

In September 1994 SEISMED hosted a training course on the key security issues for Health Care Establishments. The comments and critique from all these events was fed back into the validation of the guidelines.

Reference-contexts: If at all, they trust in different and overseeable components (hard- or software) of a large internetworked and distributed ITsystem. Thus, the security policy must adopt a decentralized view stating explicitly which subjects or groups of subjects should be able to enforce which security requirements <ref> [17] </ref>. To the contrary, most of today's security policies adopt a centralistic view, i.e., they prescribe which individuals or groups of individuals have to trust SEISMED (A2033) / HILD / DEL 32 / 9. 4. 96 5 which objects, e.g., hardware or software components, or other privileged individuals.

Reference-contexts: A separate guideline recommends cryptographic mechanisms basically for authentication and encipherment purposes. So far, the recommended mechanisms have not been integrated into an operational system at one of the reference centres. Instead, a separate demonstrator <ref> [18, 41] </ref> was built that shows how digital communication can be enciphered and signed electronically at minimal additional involvement of the user.

Reference-contexts: This code is intended to be invariant against organizational and technological development. On the one hand, fundamental changes of legislation should be reflected by the DEONTOLOGY CODE, on the other hand, the DEONTOLOGY CODE might itself lead to further legislation. The upcoming EU-directive <ref> [19] </ref> on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data has taken into account the processing of medical data (art. 8).

Reference-contexts: Given a DEONTOLOGY CODE it has to be translated into a (High Level) Security Policy for a specific health care establishment.
