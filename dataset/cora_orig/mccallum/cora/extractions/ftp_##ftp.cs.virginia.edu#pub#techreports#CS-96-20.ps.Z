Abstract: We propose a method of mapping the topical content of distributed digital libraries and demonstrate the technique using data from the Networked Computer Science Technical Report Library (NCSTRL) digital library project. This method seeks to exploit information derived from document coauthorship to produce improved automatic subject classifications of the documents. In a distributed digital library, these subject classifications are useful in characterizing both intra-site and inter-site content. They are also helpful in providing secondary retrieval services. We present the method and describe an experiment and results showing that improved clusterings can be achieved relative to traditional document clustering.

We use a weighted Jaccard coefficient to help resolve issues such as the following. Suppose that we have two clusters C 1 = (fa 1 g; m) and C 2 = (fa 1 ; a 2 g; n).

Reference-contexts: Of the three hierarchical agglomerative clustering methods most often used to cluster document collections | single link, complete link, and group average | we believe that group average offers the most promise for the present application and have chosen it as the preferred method for our work. Croft <ref> [4] </ref> and Voorhees [21] have shown these algorithms to be practical for reasonably large collections. Our approach will be seen to extend the range of document collections over which these algorithms can be applied.

Reference-contexts: This is easily done if the holdings have been cataloged but many free text systems will not have this luxury. They will have to deduce topical relatedness by other means. Knowledge of the topical content distribution will help provide a useful browse mechanism. We have chosen NCSTRL <ref> [5] </ref>, the Networked Computer Science Technical Report Library 1 , as an appropriate digital library for our work in topical clustering. The NCSTRL project provides a perfect testbed for an initial study of this type.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Digital library projects <ref> [6] </ref> place heavy demands on existing infrastructure and hence, the performance of these systems is an object of considerable study. With the increased availability of digital libraries and distributed information retrieval systems, we can expect increased demand for additional services providing better information access.

Reference-contexts: Knowledge of the topical distribution is essential for both these purposes. The second motivation for investigating topical distribution in distributed IR systems is to provide adjunct retrieval capabilities to the IR system. We have discussed a number of possible capabilities in earlier work <ref> [7] </ref>. Here we are specifically interested in the ability to broaden a query along the line of topical relatedness. For example, when users are examining the results of their queries, they might like to identify particular documents and ask for others on the same topic.

Reference-contexts: This paper looks at topical clustering as a mechanism both for examining issues affecting retrieval performance and for providing additional access to digital library resources. These two points are discussed separately below.

This concept, termed content skew [8], is one motivation for the current study. <p> These two points are discussed separately below.

Citation indexing is a well-known technique that has been used successfully for query expansion. In this technique a retrieved document is considered to be relevant to documents it cites. As Green <ref> [10, p. 649] </ref> has noted, the main assumption upon which citation indexing is predicated is that "if one document relevant to a user need has already been identified, it may be used as a stepping stone to other relevant documents." Clearly this assumption also underlies the topical relationship that we are
