Title: A note on Goodman's theorem  
Author: Ulrich Kohlenbach 
Date: April 1997  
Address: Ann Arbor MI 48109, USA  
Affiliation: Department of Mathematics University of Michigan  
Abstract: Goodman's theorem states that intuitionistic arithmetic in all finite types plus full choice, HA ! + AC, is conservative over first-order intuitionistic arithmetic HA. We show that this result does not extend to various subsystems of HA ! , HA with restricted induction.

Reference-contexts: as the predicative Kleene recursors b R ae (and in the case of HA ! j n also a functional allowing definition by cases which is redundant in E-HA ! j n ) we obtain the systems, (E-) d PA ! (E-) d HA j n due to Feferman (see <ref> [3] </ref>). PAj n , HAj n are the restrictions of PA, HA with quantifier-free induction only. Since both the modified-realizability interpretation with and without truth hold for (E-) d HA ! easily obtains the results 1),2) above also for this restricted system.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Let E-HA ! denote the system of extensional intuitionistic arithmetic and HA ! its `neutral' variant as defined in <ref> [10] </ref>). 1 E-PA ! and PA ! are the corresponding theories with classical logic. PA (resp. HA) is first-order Peano arithmetic (resp. its intuitionistic version) with all primitive recursive functions. T denotes the set of finite types. <p> consistency of PA (see e.g. [3](5.5.2)). 4 HA can be considered as a subsystem of E-HA ! either by switching to a definitorial extension of E-HA ! by adding all primitive recursive functions or modulo a suitable bi-unique mapping which translates HA into a subsystem of E-HA ! , see <ref> [10] </ref> (1.6.9) for the latter. 2 2 Results Proposition 1 Let A 2 L (PA) be such that PA ` A.
