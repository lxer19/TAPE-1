Abstract: We present a method for detection and classification of a spatial pattern in noise contaminated binary images which is based on performing subspace decomposition on a non-negative definite matrix of higher order moments of the image. We introduce a method which uses normalized power moments or ascending factorial moments as descriptors. While the set of p-th order factorial moments are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of p-th order power moments, the computation of factorial moments is much more numerically stable than the power moments. Indeed, using factorial moments we are able to implement pattern classifiers with over 30% more moment descriptors. We illustrate these techniques for word classification in binary document images.

Reference-contexts: The following important properties of the power moment matrix (2) and the factorial moment matrix (3) are proven in [7]. Both are block Hankel matrices which are symmetric non-negative definite. Both matrices have all entries in the interval <ref> [1; 1] </ref> and are sparse for any intensity which is symmetric about the center point m+1 2 of the image (Fig. 1). Finally, by construction the (1; 1) entry of these two matrices is equal to 1. <p> Then the overall image intensity (x; y) = fl (x; y) will be the sum (x; y) = s (x; y) + n (x; y) where fi = fl s =(fl s + fl n ) 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is a monotone function of signal-to-noise ratio fl s =fl n .
