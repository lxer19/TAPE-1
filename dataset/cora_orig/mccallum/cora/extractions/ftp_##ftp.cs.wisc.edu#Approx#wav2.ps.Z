Abstract: The paper is concerned with the introduction and study of multiresolution analysis based on the up function, which is an infinitely differentiable function supported on [0; 2]. Such analysis is, necessarily, nonstationary. It is shown that the approximation orders associated with the corresponding spaces are spectral, thus making the spaces attractive for the approximation of very smooth functions.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand we show in Section 3, using the general theory in <ref> [BDR1] </ref>, that the least square approximation from (S k ) is spectral, namely that, for any r 0, the L 2 (IR)-error of best approximation to f 2 W r 2 from S k is o (2 rk ). <p> Furthermore, in what follows we show that for a very smooth function f (whose Fourier transform decays exponentially), E k (f ) decays exponentially, as well. A general comprehensive discussion of L 2 -approximation orders and density orders for shift invariant spaces is given in <ref> [BDR1] </ref>. Instead of deriving Theorem 3.5 from those results, we will apply the approach taken there to our special (and much simpler) case. This will result at tighter estimates for E k (f ). Similar results in other p-norms are available as well. <p> The decay rate of the truncation error is clearly independent of ( k ), and depends on the smoothness class of f . In particular, the following can be easily proved (cf. <ref> [BDR1] </ref>): "lemlem Lemma 3.8. Let I := [t; t] be some neighborhood of the origin, and let k be the characteristic function of 2 k I. Let f 2 W r 2 , r 0. <p> In view of Lemma 3.8, a proof of Theorem 3.5 requires the study of the behaviour of the projection error. To estimate this, we employ the following result from <ref> [BDR1] </ref>: "result 7 -186 minutes from noon of 25 August 1992 Result 3.9.

Reference-contexts: The resolution obtained in this way is nonstationary in the sense that k is not a dilate of its predecessor. We provide the wavelet decomposition, based on the general theory of nonstationary multiresolution analysis of <ref> [BDR2] </ref>. We discuss the stability issue and show that the generator we choose for each wavelet space is stable (and even linearly independent), but that the L 2-stability bounds blow up with k at the rate (no faster than) (=2) 3k . <p> Wavelet decompositions The up function provides an interesting example of wavelet decompositions via multiresolution. A general discussion of these topics can be found in <ref> [BDR2] </ref>, and is certainly beyond the scope of this paper. A multiresolution begins with a sequence ( k ) k2ZZ + L 2 (IR). <p> With (2.2) in hand, one defines the wavelet space W k to be the orthogonal complement of S k in S k+1 , (2:3) W k := S k+1 S k : Under mild conditions on the sequence ( k ) (cf. section 4 of <ref> [BDR2] </ref>; these conditions are always satisfied for compactly supported ( k ), which will be the case here) the wavelet spaces provide an orthogonal decomposition of L 2 (IR) S 0 , and the subsequent task is then to find efficient (more precisely stable) methods for computing the orthogonal projection P <p> In the original formulation of multiresolution, [M], [Me], it was assumed that the ladder (S k ) is stationary, namely, that each S k+1 is the 2-dilate of S k . Analysis of nonstationary decompositions can be found in <ref> [BDR2] </ref>, with the guiding example there being exponential B-splines. The wavelet decompositions that correspond to the up function are nonstationary as well, still they form a different variant in this class. We will elaborate on that point in the sequel. <p> In particular, the size of the support of the mask sequence A k grows linearly with k. In contrast, the nonstationary decompositions associated with exponential B-splines (cf. [BDR2: x6],[DL]) employs masks with uniformly bounded support. Corollary 2.5 allows us to apply standard wavelet techniques (cf. [CW], [JM], <ref> [BDR2] </ref>). In particular, it is known [BDR2] that the function k defined by (2:6) b k1 (!) := e i!=2 k b A k (! + 2 k )t k (!) b k (!); "defpsi with (2:7) t k (!) := j222 k ZZ "deftau generates W k in the sense <p> In contrast, the nonstationary decompositions associated with exponential B-splines (cf.

From Remark 5.8 of <ref> [BDR2] </ref>, we conclude that the stability constants associated with the wavelets ( k ) grow no faster than O ((=2) 3k ). 3.

Reference-contexts: This property is known to be equivalent to k fl 0 k being injective, a property which is usually referred to as the linear independence of the 2 k ZZ-shifts of k (cf. <ref> [Ro] </ref> for details).
