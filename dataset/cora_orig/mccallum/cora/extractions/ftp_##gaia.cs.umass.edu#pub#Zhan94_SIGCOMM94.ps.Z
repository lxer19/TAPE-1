Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of providing statistical guarantees (for example, on the tail distribution of delay) under the Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) scheduling discipline. This work is motivated by, and is an extension of, Parekh and Gallager's deterministic study of GPS scheduling discipline with leaky-bucket token controlled sessions [PG93a,b, Parekh92]. Using the exponentially bounded burstiness (E.B.B.) process model introduced in [YaSi93a] as a source traffic characterization, we establish results that extend the deterministic study of GPS: for a single GPS server in isolation, we present statistical bounds on the tail distributions of backlog and delay for each session. In the network setting, we show that networks belonging to a broad class of GPS assignments, the so-called Consistent Relative Session Treatment (CRST) GPS assignments, are stable in a stochastic sense. In particular, we establish simple bounds on the tail distribution of backlog and delay for each session in an Rate Proportional Processor Sharing (RPPS) GPS network with arbitrary topology.

Reference-contexts: There are several tradeoffs involved in the choices of the E.B.B. parameters, , fl and ff. Moreover, the E.B.B. characterization of the source traffic such as the well-studied two-state on-off Markov process for modeling voice and video traffic <ref> [e.g, Brady68, HL86, SW86, MASKR88] </ref> is closely related to the theory of effective band width [e.g., EM93, GAN91, KWC93]. 7 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we studied the statistical behavior of the generalized processor sharing (GPS) scheduling discipline using exponentially bounded burstiness (E.B.B.) processes as source session traffic models

Reference-contexts: An unavoidable disadvantage associated with the use of a general traffic model is that the bounds based on such a model are generally loose. For example, several papers (e.g., <ref> [LNT94, BD94] </ref>) which assumed a more specific traffic model have appeared and improved those results of [Chang93, YaSi93a] obtained for a general traffic model. In the case of the GPS scheduling dsicipline, it should be possible to obtain better bounds for Markov Modulated Arrival Processes and Markov Modulated Fluid Model.

Reference-contexts: They introduced the concept of an exponentially bounded (E.B.) process and an exponentially bounded bursti-ness (E.B.B.) process as stochastic models of source traffic and established a theory of E.B.B. and E.B. processes for statistical analysis. In yet another paper <ref> [Chang93] </ref>, C. S. Chang presented an elegant theory of envelope processes for both deterministic and stochastic modeling of source traffic. In all of these works, attention was mostly paid to proposing models for traffic characterization and then obtaining performance bounds using the proposed model. <p> An unavoidable disadvantage associated with the use of a general traffic model is that the bounds based on such a model are generally loose. For example, several papers (e.g., [LNT94, BD94]) which assumed a more specific traffic model have appeared and improved those results of <ref> [Chang93, YaSi93a] </ref> obtained for a general traffic model. In the case of the GPS scheduling dsicipline, it should be possible to obtain better bounds for Markov Modulated Arrival Processes and Markov Modulated Fluid Model. This issue is currently under investigation.

Reference-contexts: Second, scheduling policies to be used at switches should be selected. Ideally these scheduling policies should, on the one hand, provide isolation between sessions so that the misbehavior of one session will not affect other sessions, and on the other hand, exploit statistical multiplexing gain <ref> [CSZ92] </ref>. They should also, preferably, be amenable to analysis so that theoretical bounds can be derived | the third issue. <p> We also present a numerical example to illustrate the bounds we obtain for a simple RPPS GPS network. Finally in Section 7, we conclude the paper and discuss possible future related research. 2 PRELIMINARIES Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) is also known as weighted fair queueing in the literature <ref> [e.g. DKS89, CSZ92] </ref>. It generally assumes a fluid model, ( i.e., packets are infinitely divisible 1 ) and is work-conserving. Extensions to account for the packet nature of communication are not difficult [PG93a, YaSi93b], but will not be considered here. Consider a GPS server with rate r serving N sessions. <p> This issue is currently under investigation. Another direction of possible future work is to investigate how to integrate GPS with other scheduling policies. Clark, et al. <ref> [CSZ92] </ref> argued that GPS is a good scheduling discipline to provide isolation among sessions, but can be too strict to allow sessions, especially sessions with similar characteristics, to maximally exploit the multiplexing gains.

Reference-contexts: The effect of particular scheduling policies was not well studied except for the FIFO scheduling discipline. Although FIFO is the simplest discipline and allows sharing of multiplexing gain among sessions, it is not a good discipline for session isolation. Many other scheduling policies (e.g. <ref> [DKS89, Go90, Go91, HLP91, KKK90, PG93a,b, Parekh92, VZF91, ZF93] </ref>) have been proposed. Perhaps the most widely studied non-FCFS scheduling is the generalized processor sharing (GPS) scheduling discipline (also known as weighted fair queueing).

Reference-contexts: Motivated by this work, Kurose [Kurose91] developed a model in which the traffic from each session is modeled as a stochastic process and studied statistical behavior of sessions in a high speed network. Yaron and Sidi <ref> [YaSi93a] </ref> further refined this model and proposed bounding tail distributions of source traffic by exponential decay functions. <p> Hence, if these bounds are used as admission control criteria, low utilization of network bandwidth will result. This motivates us to investigate the behavior of the GPS scheduling discipline in a stochastic setting. In this paper, we model the source session traffic as an E.B.B. process <ref> [YaSi93a] </ref>. Using techniques similar to the deterministic techniques of Parekh and Gallager's, we examine the sample path behavior of the sessions served by a single GPS server in isolation and derive several useful relations on a sample path. <p> As the source traffic model for our statistical analysis of GPS scheduling discipline, we use the exponentially bounded burstiness (E.B.B.) process model introduced in <ref> [YaSi93a] </ref>. <p> From the characterization of E.B.B. processes (Theorem 1 in <ref> [YaSi93a] </ref>), we see that ffi i (t) is an E.B. process with decay rate ff i . In the following, we will modify Yaron and Sidi's proof to derive a bound on Ee ffi i (t) for &lt; ff i . <p> Theorem 6 states that the backlog and the delay for each session decay exponentially with rate as q and d increase. Stochastic processes with such property are called exponentially bounded (E.B.) processes in <ref> [YaSi93a] </ref>. Furthermore, (23) says that for 0 &lt; &lt; min 1ji ff j , the departure process for each session i is an E.B.B. process. This yields an input-output relation under the E.B.B. model which will be useful in the analysis of networks of GPS queues. <p> For 0 &lt; &lt; min i2H k ff i , its associated arrival process is a (~ i ; e ~ k () ; )-E.B.B. process where ~ k () = i2H k ^ i () <ref> [YaSi93a] </ref>. <p> We consider a simple three-node tree structured network (Figure 2) as used in <ref> [YaSi93a] </ref>. The rate of the servers and the capacity of the links are all assumed to be 1. Suppose there are only 4 sessions in the network, two sessions at node 1 and two sessions at node 2; all sessions congregate at node 3. <p> All of the four sessions are modeled by Bernoulli processes with p 1 = 1 8 , p 2 = 1 10 and 5 respectively.

For example, several papers (e.g., [LNT94, BD94]) which assumed a more specific traffic model have appeared and improved those results of <ref> [Chang93, YaSi93a] </ref> obtained for a general traffic model. In the case of the GPS scheduling dsicipline, it should be possible to obtain better bounds for Markov Modulated Arrival Processes and Markov Modulated Fluid Model. This issue is currently under investigation.

As a consequence, we obtain simple, closed form expressions for backlog and delay bounds which are generally tighter than those in <ref> [YaSi93b] </ref>. In the network setting, we define CRST GPS assignments in terms of the feasible partition at each node. <p> This yields a larger set of CRST GPS assignments than Parekh and Gallager's original definition and hence we are able to show stability results for a broader class of GPS networks than <ref> [YaSi93b] </ref>. In particular, we obtain simple but important results for RPPS GPS networks which parallel those for the deterministic case. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the necessary notation. <p> DKS89, CSZ92]. It generally assumes a fluid model, ( i.e., packets are infinitely divisible 1 ) and is work-conserving. Extensions to account for the packet nature of communication are not difficult <ref> [PG93a, YaSi93b] </ref>, but will not be considered here. Consider a GPS server with rate r serving N sessions. Following Parekh and Gallager's definition, each session i is assigned a fixed real-valued positive parameter i , where f i g 1iN is called a GPS assignment. <p> Furthermore, (23) says that for 0 &lt; &lt; min 1ji ff j , the departure process for each session i is an E.B.B. process. This yields an input-output relation under the E.B.B. model which will be useful in the analysis of networks of GPS queues. In <ref> [YaSi93b] </ref>, a result similar to (23) is also established. However, the E.B.B. decay parameters for their output processes are obtained in a recursive manner such that they depend on the E.B.B. decay parameters of the previous output processes in a feasible ordering. <p> these L aggregate sessions such that ~ 1 &lt; P L ~ l ~ 2 &lt; : : : ~ k 1 l=k (1 l=1 ~ L : (32) A nice property about this unique ordering is that it is invariant under small increases in i 's (see [ZTK94]). 6 <ref> [YaSi93b] </ref> does not make the independence assumption as we do in this paper. As we point out here, this assumption is not useful to them. Using the notion of feasible partition, we can prove better bounds than those obtained in the previous section. <p> We also established the stability of CRST GPS network with E.B.B. arrival processes. Our analysis is based on the careful examination of the sample path behavior of GPS servers. Although our main focus is on GPS, the results can be easily extended to packetized version of GPS |PGPS (cf., <ref> [YaSi93b] </ref>). Logscale. Our study places no restriction on the arrival process for each session other than that it has to be bounded by an E.B.B process, which appears to include most processes.

Reference-contexts: As many applications, especially multimedia applications, can tolerate a certain amount of loss either due to late arrival or buffer overflow, it is more desirable if statistical bounds (i.e., soft guarantees) can also be provided. Moreover, simulation results <ref> [YKTH93] </ref> showed that deterministic upper bounds are usually very conservative. Hence, if these bounds are used as admission control criteria, low utilization of network bandwidth will result. This motivates us to investigate the behavior of the GPS scheduling discipline in a stochastic setting. <p> We are mostly interested in a comparison of the theoretical bounds with experimental data obtained from simulations of more complex networks with more realistic session traffic data such as that studied in <ref> [YKTH93] </ref>. Here it is worth pointing out that how well the theoretical bounds are going to match the experimental data will, in large part, depend on how well the E.B.B. process characterizes the source traffic.

Reference-contexts: The effect of particular scheduling policies was not well studied except for the FIFO scheduling discipline. Although FIFO is the simplest discipline and allows sharing of multiplexing gain among sessions, it is not a good discipline for session isolation. Many other scheduling policies (e.g. <ref> [DKS89, Go90, Go91, HLP91, KKK90, PG93a,b, Parekh92, VZF91, ZF93] </ref>) have been proposed. Perhaps the most widely studied non-FCFS scheduling is the generalized processor sharing (GPS) scheduling discipline (also known as weighted fair queueing).

Reference-contexts: For simplicity of exposition, we will assume that the arrival processes are all independent. The bounds for the case where the arrival processes are not all independent can be analogously derived using Holder's inequality, see <ref> [ZTK94] </ref> for details. <p> dering on these L aggregate sessions such that ~ 1 &lt; P L ~ l ~ 2 &lt; : : : ~ k 1 l=k (1 l=1 ~ L : (32) A nice property about this unique ordering is that it is invariant under small increases in i 's (see <ref> [ZTK94] </ref>). 6 [YaSi93b] does not make the independence assumption as we do in this paper.
