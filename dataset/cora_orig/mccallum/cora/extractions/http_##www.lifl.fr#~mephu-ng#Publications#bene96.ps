Abstract: This paper studies the computational complexity of the similarity based learning system LEGAL-E. LEGAL-E uses learning parameters to build a join-semi-lattice that characterizes a concept materialized by a set of instances described with binary attributes. LEGAL-E was successfully applied to real problems in different domains. However difficulties remain in the choice of learning parameters. This paper addresses this issue by proposing possible best values for such parameters.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Various machine learning (ML) systems exist and differ according to the fundamental paradigm they implement (Analytic, Genetic, Connexionist, ...), to the way according which learning concepts are represented (disjoint sets, characteristic sets, ...), the use of incremental algorithms or not, etc <ref> [2] </ref>. Similarity-based learning (SBL) methods stands between connexionist approaches, which prove superior with respect to unstructured continuous domains with many training examples, and analytic methods best for well-structured knowledge-rich domains, even with few training examples.

Reference-contexts: Moreover the choice of Galois lattice is due to (i) its good formalization <ref> [4, 16] </ref> and (ii) the possibility to parallelize the lattice building algorithm in order to increase the running time [11]. LEGAL-E uses a top-down generalization method by means of a Galois lattice to build regularities.

Reference-contexts: The fact that we build only the valid regularities decreases our running time and allows to handle data sets of reasonable lengths. 2.2.2 Learning complexity of LEGAL-E This section gives time and space complexities of LEGAL-E on the basis of works done by Bordat [1] and Godin <ref> [5] </ref> in the case of complete lattice. Details of these results can be found in [12]. ff and fi are learning bias needed by LEGAL-E and it is obvious that they affect the system behavior.Consider n = jO + j, m = jAj, examples and attributes size respectively. <p> This analysis of learning and classification results is done in order to evaluate the theoretical complexity. The program (C code) was performed on a Pentium 133 machine (Unix environment) with 32M o memory. Experimental computation usually deals with random datasets as done by Godin <ref> [5] </ref>. To analyze ML systems, it's important to know exactly what you have to learn, then compare it with what is effectively learned. Consequently datasets couldn't be uncertain.

Reference-contexts: For ff values greater than 50% of examples, the time complexity grows by steps. * In figure 4:a, the number of nodes in the lattice is in accordance with the time complexity. We have the same variations as in figure 3:a. Therefore we agree with the remark made in <ref> [7] </ref>: "The memory required by a space search algorithm grows linearly with the running time and exponentially with the problem size". * Figure 4:b gives an interesting result: for a fixed number of objects, the number of regularities in the lattice grows slowly after attempting a number of attributes and when

The key elements are context, Galois connection, concept and order relation. Context : A context C (see figure 1) is a triple (O; A; I) where O (resp.
