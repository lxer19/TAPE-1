Abstract: In automatic process planning for robotic assembly, the range of directions along which a part can be assembled with another without interference from portions of the mating parts is of crucial importance. This set of directions constitutes what are called assembly directions, and can be represented by a set of vectors. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for determining this set of vectors, and their maximum possible range for a given feature.

Reference-contexts: spanning vectors of the parts. 4 Spanning Vector 4.1 Mathematical background A set X in E n is called a convex set if given any two points x 1 and x 2 in set X, then r x 1 + (1 r) x 2 2 X for each r 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. r x 1 + (1 r) x 2 for r in the interval [0; 1] represents a point on the line segment joining x 1 and x 2 . The boundary of a convex set can be classified as extreme points or regular points. <p> E n is called a convex set if given any two points x 1 and x 2 in set X, then r x 1 + (1 r) x 2 2 X for each r 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. r x 1 + (1 r) x 2 for r in the interval [0; 1] represents a point on the line segment joining x 1 and x 2 . The boundary of a convex set can be classified as extreme points or regular points. <p> Directions d 1 and d 2 are called distinct directions if d 1 cannot be represented as a positive multiple of d 2 <ref> [1] </ref>. Figure 7 shows an example of extreme directions of a convex set. The concept of convex sets in 2D can be extended to convex sets in 3D. A special class of convex sets in 3D is a convex cone. <p> To illustrate, choose a direction d shown in the Figure. It can be seen that d can be represented as a linear combination of d 2 and d 5 . That is d = r d 2 + (1 r) d 5 r 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> The concept of convex set and convex cone is essential in our methodology for finding spanning vectors of a part, since we use polyhedral convex cone to represent the spanning vectors of a part. 4.2 Algorithm for finding spanning vector Orientation of a face can be determined by the

Reference-contexts: Hoermann and Rembold (1988) described a hierarchical robot action planning system for automatic assembly. In their work, they introduce translation motions in assembly, which are computed from the type of assembly contact using heuristics <ref> [2] </ref>. For automatic process planning for machining, Tseng and Joshi (1991) developed two algorithms to determine feasible tool-approach directions for machining Bezier curves and surfaces. In their algorithm, the surfaces are approximated by many small faces, which are treated as planes, and map onto a 3D sphere.

Reference-contexts: When it has not reached zero, more spatial relationships are needed. In other words, Spatial relationships of the parts can be interpreted as a constraint imposed on the degrees of freedom between relative mating or interacting faces of the parts <ref> [3] </ref>. In Figure 4, the task is to assemble part A and part B. If an against relationship is given between face 1 of part A and face 4 of part B, we impose a constraint on the degree of freedom between the two 9 faces. <p> A Spatial Relationship Engine has been developed by other researchers in our laboratory to perform this type of operation <ref> [3] </ref>. If we know the fixed position and orientation of the parts after the assembly takes place, we can determine the area where the boundaries of the parts overlap, 11 and we know the mating faces of the parts.

Reference-contexts: These frames are called mating frames. Assembly between two parts can then be expressed by these mating frames. A mathematical model is applied to determine a collection of spatial relationships to configure the final and fixed location of the parts after the assembly process takes place <ref> [5] </ref>. As an example, coordinate frame of P ART a is O a and the mating frame of P ART a is M a . O b is the origin coordinate frame of P ART b and M b is the mating frame of P ART b .

Reference-contexts: Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. Among those methods, Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) and Boundary Representation (B-rep) are the most popular ones to represent solid objects and therefore used by most CAD systems today <ref> [6] </ref>. Basically, CSG representation is an ordered binary tree. The terminal nodes of the tree represents a solid in the modeling space, and the non-terminal nodes of the tree represent the operation, such as intersection and difference.

Reference-contexts: The most significant aspect of the design is the choice of the parting surface location, that is the location of the surface separating the two halves of the mold or die. A combination of several mechanical, metallurgical and process parameters influences the choice of the 4 parting surface <ref> [7] </ref>. The algorithm presented in this paper can be used to assess the feasibility of parting surface locations of a mold or die, by looking at the directions of mold closure. This enables design engineers to have choices of parting surface location alternatives.

Reference-contexts: Sedas and Talukdar (1987) also developed an algorithm for a disassembly planner. One of the steps in their algorithm is Picking a Promising Direction for disassembly using trial and error approach <ref> [8] </ref>. The concept they use for picking a promising direction for disassembly can also be used for picking a promising direction for assembly. Hoermann and Rembold (1988) described a hierarchical robot action planning system for automatic assembly.

Reference-contexts: In other words, the set of tool-approach directions can help determine the position and orientation of the part, so that no interference will occur during machining <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> In their algorithm, the surfaces are approximated by many small faces, which are treated as planes, and map onto a 3D sphere. They use this sphere to represent the set of tool-approach directions <ref> [10] </ref>. Unfortunately, except for very few cases such as the above scheme, many of the algorithms cannot be applied in three dimensional space. In addition, many algorithms use a trial-and-error approach. This approach is not only inefficient, but also infeasible if seen from a computational viewpoint.

Reference-contexts: For example, T.C Woo (1987) developed a procedure to generate a sequence of motions for removing parts from 5 a final assembly. In that work, Woo uses the notion of monotonicity for generating disassembly direction <ref> [11] </ref>. In general, disassembly directions are the same as assembly directions since the problem of finding how to assemble a given set of parts can be converted into an equivalent problem of finding how the same parts can be disassembled.

Reference-contexts: This solid-based representation is not suitable for our purposes, since what is stored is the 7 procedure by which a part was created, rather than the information of the final part <ref> [12] </ref>. Another alternative is to get the necessary information using Boundary Representation method. Boundary Representation represents a solid object by segmenting its boundary into a finite number of bounded faces. Each face is defined by a set of bounding edges which in turn defined by their endpoints.
