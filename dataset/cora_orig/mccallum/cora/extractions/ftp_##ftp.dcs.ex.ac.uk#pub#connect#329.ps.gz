Abstract: Quantum computing (physically-based computation founded on quantum-theoretic concepts) is gaining prominence because of recent claims for its massively increased computational efficiency, its potential for bridging brain and mind, and its increasing relevance as computer technology develops into nanotechnology. Its impact on neural information processing has so far been minimal. This paper introduces some basic concepts inspired by quantum theory for use in neural network training and identifies a method inspired by the `many universes' interpretation of quantum behaviour which promises greater efficiency and perhaps solvability of problems currently not amenable to a neural network approach. Instead of one network being trained on many patterns, many single layer networks are trained on one pattern each. The weights of each network are used to derive a quantum network, the weights of which are calculated as a superposition of individual network weights. Two microfeature tasks are used for network training. Each quantum network is compared with a standard control network. This shows that, on average, the quantum networks learn faster than the controls and give an equal number of errors, or less, in testing.

Reference-contexts: QC is founded principally on two fundamental principles of quantum theory. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that both the position and the momentum of an electron cannot be known <ref> (see Haken and Wolf, 1980) </ref>. This is because in the act of measuring, some energy must be focused on the particle (e.g. a photon from a laser). The energy of the photon can be absorbed by the measured particle, sending it into a different orbit.

Reference-contexts: the mind, and Hameroff's (1994) proposal that consciousness emerges as a macroscopic quantum state from a critical level of coherence of quantum-level events in and around cytoskeletal microtubules within neurons, raise important questions for the scientific foundations of cognitive science and the appropriate level for a computational account of mind/brain <ref> (Narayanan, 1995) </ref>. Moreover, as computer technology develops into nanotechnology, there will be a need for appropriate quantum-level descriptions of the behaviour of nanocircuits and quantum logic gates (Deutsch, 1989; Deutsch et al., 1994; Barenco et al., 1994).
