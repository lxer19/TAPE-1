Reference-contexts: Jakobsen [8] gave a list of all 3-critical graphs with at most 10 vertices and showed that there are 3-critical graphs with 5, 7 and 9 vertices while there are no such graphs of even order. He formulated the following conjecture which was also stated by Beineke and Wilson <ref> [1] </ref>. Conjecture 1.1 (Critical Graph Conjecture) For every k 1 there is no k-critical graph of even order. This conjecture is certainly true for k = 1; 2. Goldberg [7] disproved it for k = 3, and Chetwynd and Fiol independently disproved it for k = 4, see [3].

Reference-contexts: As a consequence of our investigations we state the following corollary which answers a question of Yap [11]. Corollary 1.8 There are 4-critical graphs of odd order n with degree sequence 23 2 4 n3 . 2 Basic Results and Constructions The Parity Lemma <ref> [2] </ref> is a useful tool in the theory of edge-colorings of multigraphs. We state it as follows.

Reference-contexts: Conjecture 1.1 (Critical Graph Conjecture) For every k 1 there is no k-critical graph of even order. This conjecture is certainly true for k = 1; 2. Goldberg [7] disproved it for k = 3, and Chetwynd and Fiol independently disproved it for k = 4, see <ref> [3] </ref>. The following two statements are also known to be false for k 2 f3; 4g, see [5]. Conjecture 1.2 ([6]) For all k 1 every k-critical graph of even order has a 1-factor.

Reference-contexts: This conjecture is certainly true for k = 1; 2. Goldberg [7] disproved it for k = 3, and Chetwynd and Fiol independently disproved it for k = 4, see [3]. The following two statements are also known to be false for k 2 f3; 4g, see <ref> [5] </ref>. Conjecture 1.2 ([6]) For all k 1 every k-critical graph of even order has a 1-factor. <p> By switching between multigraphs and graphs we obtain Theorem 1.5 For any k 4 there is a k-critical multigraph of order 12k 20. For any odd k 3 there is a k-critical multigraph of order 7k + 1. - 2 - Applying results of Choudum <ref> [5] </ref> we derive: Theorem 1.6 For each k 3 there is a k-critical graph of even order without 1-factor.

Reference-contexts: For k 0 we define a multigraph M to be k-critical if (M ) = k, 0 (M ) = k + 1 and 0 (M e) &lt; 0 (M ) for each e 2 E (M ). Jakobsen <ref> [8] </ref> gave a list of all 3-critical graphs with at most 10 vertices and showed that there are 3-critical graphs with 5, 7 and 9 vertices while there are no such graphs of even order.

Reference-contexts: This idea is basically due to Meredith <ref> [9] </ref>. Theorem 2.4 For k 2, let M be a multigraph with (M ) = k, and v 2 V (M ) with d M (v) = d k.

Reference-contexts: The chromatic index 0 (M ) of a multigraph M is the smallest number k so that there is a k-coloring of M . Vizing <ref> [10] </ref> proved that 0 (M) 2 f (M ); : : : ; (M ) + (M )g, i.e. the chromatic index of a graph is or + 1.

Reference-contexts: As a consequence of our investigations we state the following corollary which answers a question of Yap <ref> [11] </ref>. Corollary 1.8 There are 4-critical graphs of odd order n with degree sequence 23 2 4 n3 . 2 Basic Results and Constructions The Parity Lemma [2] is a useful tool in the theory of edge-colorings of multigraphs. We state it as follows. <p> It is well known that any Hajos-union of two k-critical graphs is k-critical whenever the sum of the degrees of the two vertices used in the construction is smaller or equal to k + 2, cf. <ref> [11] </ref> Thm. 4.6. With almost the same prove this statement holds true for k-critical multigraphs. <p> Combining r;s and 0 yields a k-coloring of M 0 e. * Our strategy is to construct k-critical graphs from k-critical multigraphs and then we will apply the following theorem of Yap <ref> [11] </ref>. - 5 - Theorem 2.6 (Yap's Construction) For k 4 let G be a k-critical graph with two vertices v, w of degree 2. Let G 0 be a copy of G with the corresponding vertices v 0 , w 0 .
