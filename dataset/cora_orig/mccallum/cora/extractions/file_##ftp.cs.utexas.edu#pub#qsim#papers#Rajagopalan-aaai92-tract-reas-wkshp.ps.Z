Abstract: Results of an Experiment in Domain Knowledge Base Construction: A Abstract Jon Doyle and Ramesh Patil have recently argued that classification languages that obtain polynomial worst case response times by eliminating inefficient constructs are in fact too restrictive to represent many forms of knowledge. They suggest that some of these restrictions could be avoided by incorporating and constraining the use of problematic constructs rather than eliminating them. We extend the observations of Doyle and Patil by reporting our experience in using the CLASSIC and Algernon knowledge representation languages to model the domain of magnetic field induced emf problems. We found that both languages had representational advantages not found in the other. We discuss the impact that the lack of a given feature has on the model builder and examine ways to add additional features to the languages while minimizing changes to each language.

Reference-contexts: introduction to the knowledge representation features of CLASSIC and Algernon. Readers who are familiar with the two languages may proceed to Section 2. 1.1 Descriptions of CLASSIC and Algernon CLASSIC is a classification language with many restrictions on expressive power, as noted by the language designers themselves <ref> [Brachman et al. 1991] </ref>. Algernon is a general purpose language for defining classes of concepts and for expressing and proving relations between concepts. The user is free to define any number of inference rules in access-limited logic [Crawford and Kuipers 1989] to perform a desired reasoning task. <p> In general, the value set is defined implicitly by specifying a class whose individual members are to be legal values. CLASSIC also allows the model builder to provide an enumerated list of possible values through its ONE-OF roles restriction operator <ref> [Brachman et al. 1991] </ref>. Explicit lists of values are more difficult to include in an Algernon model. Lists may be asserted as values directly, but this strategy requires external LISP calls to operate on the list.

Reference-contexts: The actual inference has to be done in LISP through the TEST-C mechanism since CLASSIC does not provide a NOT operator. Algernon currently provides the :cardinality keyword argument in definitions of relations <ref> [Crawford and Kuipers 1991B] </ref> to define the maximum number of fillers. This mechanism could be used in a manner similar to CLASSIC to explicitly close the world when all the fillers for a relation have been found. <p> Since concepts are well defined in CLASSIC, roles could easily be typed by concepts to be related without much effect on efficiency. 3 Conclusions We have described the results of an experiment in which the knowledge representation languages, CLASSIC [Brach-man et al. 1991] and Algernon <ref> [Crawford and Kuipers 1991B] </ref> were used to model the domain of magnetic field induced emf problems, and have used our experimental results to extend the observations of Doyle and Patil [Doyle and Patil 1991] regarding the features of the CLASSIC-like languages.

Reference-contexts: We found that both CLASSIC and Algernon had representational advantages not found in the other. Our results are summarized in Table 1. The first column lists several methods of defining concepts that Doyle and Patil <ref> [Doyle and Patil 1991] </ref> have found to be inexpressible in CLASSIC-like languages. <p> have described the results of an experiment in which the knowledge representation languages, CLASSIC [Brach-man et al. 1991] and Algernon [Crawford and Kuipers 1991B] were used to model the domain of magnetic field induced emf problems, and have used our experimental results to extend the observations of Doyle and Patil <ref> [Doyle and Patil 1991] </ref> regarding the features of the CLASSIC-like languages. We found that both languages had features not found in the other, For example, CLASSIC can handle some cases of negation-by-failure through its ability to partially close the world, while Algernon only allows negation-by-failure through the non-monotonic :unp operator.

Reference-contexts: For the Algernon model, a taxonomic hierarchy of object classes (concepts) was provided explicitly, and many inference rules were written to prove relations between these concepts. The CLASSIC model builder gains an intrinsic inference mechanism for proving subsumption relations <ref> [Resnick et al. 1991] </ref>, but has little freedom to define additional inference rules. We therefore organized the domain knowledge into a hierarchy of concepts, and considered the CLASSIC model to be successful if the individuals in a given world description were properly classified. <p> In particular, we found that CLASSIC is limited most by the fact that it is designed to operate on one individual at a time. We found that we often had to resort to CLASSIC's TEST-C mechanism <ref> [Resnick et al. 1991] </ref> to access more than one object at once, and to prove that certain relationships were true in the domain. The TEST-C mechanism allows the user to use an external LISP function to determine a truth value for an expression. <p> The model builder can state the number of fillers that a role can have, and once all the role fillers have been found for an object of interest, CLASSIC will automatically close the world <ref> [Resnick et al. 1991] </ref>, thus allowing inferences involving negation-by-failure. The actual inference has to be done in LISP through the TEST-C mechanism since CLASSIC does not provide a NOT operator. <p> Then, Algernon could use negation-by-failure to infer NOT A from the fact that A is currently unprovable. Equivalence Under the category of equivalence, we place the need to express that the value of one role is equal to the value of another role. CLASSIC's SAME-AS restriction <ref> [Resnick et al. 1991] </ref> allows one to express the condition that the value returned by two different access paths must be the same. However, there isn't a means to infer a value for a role filler. This presented many difficulties.
