Title: THE SEARCH FOR EXTRASOLAR PLANETARY SYSTEMS:  
Note: A comparitive review is made of different techniques in the search for extrasolar planets. Special attention is paid to the planet parameters which can be derived in each method. The most recent findings are presented.

Reference-contexts: methods, namely imaging, astrometry and accelerometry, listed in Table 2, are in fact sensitive only to the presence of outer planets (as far as current searches and sufficiently close to completion projects are concerned); there are naturally ambitious projects to detect Earth-like inner planets with these methods (see for instance <ref> [1] </ref> and the "TOPS report" [20]), but they have no chance to become operational before at least a couple of decades.

Reference-contexts: In addition to these staightfor-ward classical effects, the presence of the planet can be revealed by other means. 1) If the star has modulations in its light curve (flares etc.), the planet presents by illumination the same modulations with a delay DT <ref> [5] </ref>. 2) If the orbital plane of the planet is correctly oriented, it produces a drop in the star light during transits (duration D occ 1-20hrs); for a random orientation of the planet orbital plane, the geometric probability of the transit is p = R ? =a for a single star <p> M sini, a chromospheric activity ? [23] A more exotic possibility is to search for the echo of the flares of a star on a nearby planet; this echo will have a delay proportionnal to a and an amplitude inversely proportional to a 2 ; thus, as shown by Bromley <ref> [5] </ref>, this method is efficient only for very inner planets.

Reference-contexts: Planets are divided in two categories: solid and gaseous. It is an empirical fact that all the solid planets or planetary cores in the solar system have a mass at most 15 times the Earth mass <ref> [10] </ref>. In the PSR1257+12 system, the masses of the planets are 3 times the Earth mass or less [24].

Reference-contexts: Although their search has started in the 30's (at least in contemporary times; there has been a first attempt in the XVII th century by Huygens <ref> [12] </ref> 1 ), it could have been unsuccessful because the different methods of detection were not enough sensitive.
