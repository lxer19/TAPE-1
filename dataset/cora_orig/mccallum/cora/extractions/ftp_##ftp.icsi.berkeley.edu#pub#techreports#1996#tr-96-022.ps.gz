Title: Determining Priority Queue Performance from Second Moment Traffic Characterizations  
Author: Edward W. Knightly 
Date: June 1996  
Pubnum: TR-96-022  
Abstract: A crucial problem to the efficient design and management of integrated services networks is how to best allocate and reserve network resources for heterogeneous and bursty traffic streams in multiplexers that support prioritized service disciplines. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for determining per-connection QoS parameters such as delay-bound violation probability and loss probability in multi-service networks. The approach utilizes a traffic characterization that consists of the variances of a stream's rate distribution over multiple interval lengths, which captures its burstiness properties and autocorrelation structure. The resource allocation scheme is based on application of the Central Limit Theorem over intervals, together with use of stochastic delay-bounding techniques; it results in simple and efficient algorithms for determining QoS parameters. We perform experiments with long traces of MPEG-compressed video and show that the new scheme is accurate enough to capture most of the inherent statistical multiplexing gain, achieving average network utilizations of up to 90% for these traces.

Reference-contexts: While we share a second-order traffic characterization with the above works, our focus here is quite different. In particular, we use new analysis techniques that are analogous to the deterministic delay bounding techniques of <ref> [3] </ref>, which are extended in [24] to provide necessary and sufficient deterministic delay bounds for prioritized service disciplines such as Static Priority (SP) and Earliest Deadline First (EDF). <p> Extending 2 performance analysis techniques to such service disciplines is crucial to providing integrated services, i.e., to providing connections with a variety of delay bounds, loss probabilities, and so on.

First, the (m; RV (n)) characterization can be inferred or bounded based on the streams' specified parameters, which may be worst case parameters such as the (; ) leaky bucket model <ref> [3] </ref> or the D-BIND model's rate-interval pairs [17]. For example, in [16], a scheme is presented to upper bound a stream's variance over intervals based on its worst-case parameters as given by the D-BIND model.

Reference-contexts: While it is well-known that streams' autocorrelation structure has an impact on queue performance as compared to a renewal process, it has been the subject of ongoing debate which correlation time-scales are of interest for determination of the queue performance (see <ref> [5] </ref> and [26] for opposing viewpoints). For example, as noted in [8] and [20], an uncorrelated process with EX m X m+n = 0 for n 6= 0 has RV (n) = V ar (X)=n. As well, short-range-dependent processes have an RV (n) that asymptotically decreases with 1=n.

Reference-contexts: This allows provisioning of end-to-end performance bounds in terms of loss and delay, and delivers a bounded delay-jitter service as well. To provide statistical QoS bounds, an algorithm is presented in <ref> [9] </ref> which utilizes the Central Limit Theorem. Specifically, the scheme is termed "duration-limited" statistical multiplexing because the mean and variance of arrivals over a single frame-time (the Stop-and-Go frame time) are used to calculate the loss probability.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, as discussed below, our techniques for determining queue performance are quite different from those above. Moreover, we consider queue performance for priority service disciplines which were not considered in these previous works. The Stop-and-Go service discipline is proposed and analyzed in <ref> [10] </ref>. With Stop-and-Go's framing structure (time is slotted into frames), specific properties of the traffic streams are maintained even as connections traverse multiple network hops. This allows provisioning of end-to-end performance bounds in terms of loss and delay, and delivers a bounded delay-jitter service as well.

Reference-contexts: Based on the second moment characterization of traffic streams, we introduce new resource allocation algorithms that provide simple-to-compute approximations for network performance metrics such as packet-loss probability and delay-bound-violation probability. Specifically, we build on the stochastic delay bounds of <ref> [16] </ref> and [18] and introduce techniques for application of the Central Limit Theorem over intervals.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, the rate's variance has fallen considerably even by the MPEG Group Of Pictures time of 0.5 seconds. Such a characteristic can be viewed as a stochastic analogue of the deterministic characterization in <ref> [17] </ref>. That deterministic model characterizes traffic with bounding or worst-case rates over multiple interval lengths. It captures the property that over longer interval lengths, sources can be upper-bounded by a rate that is lower than their peak rate, and closer to their long-term average rate. <p> Moreover, this property is essential to any scheme that extracts a statistical multiplexing gain. Indeed, if this property is not satisfied and, for example, streams tend to synchronize, resources will need to be allocated using worst-case schemes such as in <ref> [17] </ref>. Second, within a single stream, an arbitrary correlation structure is allowed, so that no restrictions are made on the burstiness properties of streams or the time-scales of their autocorrelation. The same is true of the aggregate process, which also does not have restrictions on its correlation structure. <p> Several possibilities are described below. First, the (m; RV (n)) characterization can be inferred or bounded based on the streams' specified parameters, which may be worst case parameters such as the (; ) leaky bucket model [3] or the D-BIND model's rate-interval pairs <ref> [17] </ref>.

Further details of the traces may be found in the respective references. <p> This curve is as calculated in <ref> [17] </ref> and [27] and serves as a base-line for determining how much statistical multiplexing gain is achieved. Thus, we note from multiplexing.

The techniques allow for direct calculations of QoS from the variance characterization without requiring that the traffic characterization be mapped to other processes such as the MMPP. <p> Alternatively, for static priority, the packet at the head of the highest-priority non-empty queue is always serviced next. In <ref> [18] </ref>, Kurose introduced a framework for providing statistical network performance bounds based on characterizing sources with a family of bounding random variables. <p> A stochastic bound on delay for a FCFS multiplexer with link speed l serving N connections characterized by their respective families of bounding random variables is shown in <ref> [18] </ref> to be: P robfD &gt; dg max 0t k fi P robf N X B j (t k ) lt k ldg (3) where D is a random variable representing the delay of a randomly selected cell and fi is an upper bound on the busy period (calculation of fi <p> robf N X B j (t k ) lt k ldg (3) where D is a random variable representing the delay of a randomly selected cell and fi is an upper bound on the busy period (calculation of fi is discussed in [3],<ref> [18] </ref>). In order to apply the framework of [18] to priority service disciplines that are better suited than FCFS for providing integrated services, we use the necessary and sufficient deterministic schedulability tests of [24] as a foundation for providing stochastic bounds on delay and loss. <p> This was demonstrated in <ref> [18] </ref> for the FCFS result of Equation (3). For the previous t k seconds, cells from higher priority levels may also arrive and contribute to the random cell's delay. <p> track the complex behavior of the queue performance across a wide range of loads and QoS parameters. 5 Conclusion In this paper, we introduced a new scheme for determining priority queue performance based on second moment characterizations of traffic streams, and building on the stochastic bounding techniques of [16] and <ref> [18] </ref>.

Thus, we note from multiplexing. Indeed, the utilizations for the deterministic case are in the range of 10% to 30% while those for the statistical case are in the range of 60% to 90%.

Reference-contexts: will directly use the streams' variances in the resource allocation algorithm discussed below, regardless of the specific shape of the variance-interval curve. 3.2 Bounding Delay in a Static Priority Scheduler As shown in Figure 2, a static priority scheduler consists of a number of prioritized FCFS queues, where, as in <ref> [28] </ref>, each queue has an associated delay bound and probability of delay bound violation. At connection setup time, each connection is assigned a priority level that is based on the connection's requested QoS, including its requested end-to-end delay bound and probability of delay bound violation.
