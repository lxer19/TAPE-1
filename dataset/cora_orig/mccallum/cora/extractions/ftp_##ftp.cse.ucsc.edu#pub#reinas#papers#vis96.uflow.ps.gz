Abstract: Uncertainty or errors are introduced in fluid flow data as the data is acquired, transformed and rendered. Although researchers are aware of these uncertainties, little has been done to incorporate them in the existing visualization systems for fluid flow. In the absence of integrated presentation of data and its associated uncertainty, the analysis of the visualization is incomplete at best and may lead to inaccurate or incorrect conclusions. This work presents UFLOW a system for visualizing uncertainty in fluid flow. Although there are several sources of uncertainties in fluid flow data, in this work, we focus on uncertainty arising from the use of different numerical algorithms for computing particle traces in a fluid flow. The techniques that we have employed to visualize uncertainty in fluid flow include uncertainty glyphs, flow envelopes, animations, priority sequences, twirling batons of trace viewpoints, and rakes. These techniques are effective in making the users aware of the effects of different integration methods and their sensitivity especially near critical points in the flow field.

Reference-contexts: In real circulating flows, it is more likely that the streamlines pass near the starting points rather than return exactly to their starting points. For example, Bajer et al. <ref> [1] </ref> describes such a flow, which is an incompressible three-dimensional stretch-twist-fold fluid flow.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this practice of presenting data together with uncertainty information is lost in more recent visualization techniques. Nevertheless, integrated presentation of data with uncertainty is considered a worthy goal in scientific visualization <ref> [2, 25] </ref>. This paper takes some significant steps towards achieving this goal in fluid flow visualization. The first step is to characterize the uncertainty in fluid flow. <p> not necessarily new and have been used in other contexts, they are very useful tools when analyzing the effects of different uncertainty sources on fluid flow streamlines. 2 UNCERTAINTY 2.1 What is Uncertainty? The NIST standards report on uncertainty [25] and the NCGIA initiative on Visualization of Spatial Data Quality <ref> [2] </ref> define data uncertainty very broadly to include concepts such as statistical variation or spread, error or inaccuracy, and minimum-maximum ranges. Statistical uncertainty is given by the estimated mean and standard deviation, which can be used to calculate a confidence interval, or an actual distribution of the data. <p> Pseudo-coloring is then used to indicate the scalar magnitudes in the difference images or volumes. Animation, segmentation, and blurring have also been used to visualize fuzzy data [9]. Yet other techniques for visualizing uncertainty include transparency for comparing surface interpolants [21], haziness corresponding to uncertainty <ref> [2] </ref>, and defocussing or Monte Carlo blurring [7]. Error analysis visualizations are also common in the field of statistical visualization [27, 6, 29]. There are also work on extending visualization techniques such as the use of glyphs and textures to include uncertainty information.

Reference-contexts: This is the step that we focus on in this work. What possible visualization techniques can be used to display uncertainty? The number of visual variables available to human eye are limited. Bertin classifies all retinal variables into seven categories hue, saturation, value, shape, size, orientation, and location <ref> [3] </ref>. These categories have been utilized to devise clever schemes in computer graphics and scientific visualization. Glyphs and textures are two such examples that convey scientific information about data.

Reference-contexts: These quantities are not immune from the different sources of uncertainties described in Section 2.2. Many different techniques such as hedgehogs, particle tracing, surface particles, stream polygons, stream ribbons, and streamballs <ref> [4] </ref> have been used for fluid flow visualization [23]. All these techniques are also subject to the different sources of uncertainties. These uncertainties can however be represented as a scalar or vector valued function that captures the difference, inaccuracy, or confidence level of the flow feature of interest.

The side-by-side comparison is useful when the differences are large and immediately obvious. Otherwise, it puts too much burden on the user to identify the location and magnitude of the difference.

These data sets include a helical data flow, a spiral data flow, a sharp corner data flow, a stretch-twist-fold data flow, and a closed loop data flow. Knowing the behavior of these flow data helped us verify the correctness of our visual mapping strategies. <p> A physical example that produces this pattern is a spinning propeller [30]. Variations of this helical flow are often used for testing streamlines and particle tracking algorithms <ref> [19, 18, 17, 13] </ref>. The 3-d mass conservative velocity field for the spiral data flow is given as: v (x; y; z) = (ax by)i + (bx + ay)j + (2az + c)k.

Reference-contexts: We have tested these methods on analytical data sets. The resulting visualizations of data and uncertainty are integrated together. This is an important first step towards presenting an accurate depiction of the data to the user. Recently UFLOW has also been extended to incorporate sonification <ref> [14] </ref>. We believe that these methods will prove valuable to people who need to make informed decisions based on imperfect data or processes. We plan to extend this work in several directions. First, UFLOW can be easily extended to incorporate new flow visualization algorithms aside from streamlines.

Reference-contexts: Glyphs or icons [22] have often been used for visualizing fluid flows [24]. The traditional arrow vector glyph has recently been extended to encode information about uncertainty in both direction and mag-nitude <ref> [33] </ref>. Likewise, texture mapping [11] has been used in scientific visualization [28]. More recently, these techniques, together with iterated function systems have been used to visualize geometric uncertainty of surface interpolants [15, 31, 32], and compare differences of 3D surface attributes [20]. 4 UFLOW UFLOW stands for uncertainty flow visualization.
