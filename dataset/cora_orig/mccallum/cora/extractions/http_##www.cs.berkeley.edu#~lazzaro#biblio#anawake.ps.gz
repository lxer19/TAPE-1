Abstract: Single-chip, low-power, programmable digital signal processing systems are capable of hosting complete speech processing applications, while consuming a few milliwatts of average power. We present a power management architecture that decreases the average power consumption of these systems to 3-10 microwatts, in applications where speech signals are present with a sufficiently low duty cycle. In this architecture, a micropower analog signal processing system, Anawake, continuously analyzes the incoming signal, and controls the power consumption of the DSP system in a signal-dependent way. We estimate system power consumption for Anawake designs optimized for different peak-speech-signal to average-background-noise ratios.

In this analysis, we model the single-chip DSP system as predicted in <ref> [3] </ref>, with 0.25mW/MIPS power dissipation during normal processing. We assume the sleep-mode power dissipation P s of this single-chip DSP is 1W . We also assume the on-chip analog-to-digital conversion system requires 100W to condition and sample to speech signal.

Reference-contexts: A battery-operated, continuously-listening speech recognition system would require an implementation with an average power consumption in the 1-10 microwatt range. Microwatt analog signal processing techniques <ref> [4] </ref> have been developed for niche applications such as hearing aids. Microwatt analog pattern recognition systems have also been developed for implantable medical devices; one recent example, an intracardiac arrhythmia classifier [5], includes a statistical classifier similar to those used in speech recognition architectures. <p> A micropower wavelet analog filterbank [6,7] can be used to provide the initial spectral decomposition; a 64-channel, logarthimic-scale filter-bank, covering frequencies up to 4 Khz with 60dB dynamic range, consumes about 5W of power. A variety of weak-inversion building blocks for array and scalar signal processing, as reviewed in <ref> [4] </ref>, can be used for spectral post-processing and decision making.

Reference-contexts: Recent research has focused on analog micropower implementations of other structures used in speech recognition, include speech feature extraction [6,7] and hidden Markov model state decoding <ref> [8] </ref>. These processing systems offer peak microwatt power consumption, permitting the use of energy sources with low maximum current ratings, such as lithium button batteries.

Reference-contexts: with the speech signal, as well as the signal-to-noise ratio of the speech signal and the background noise. 4.1 Energy Contour Methods Energy-contour approaches to speech detection work well in applications where the peak-speech-signal to average-background-noise ratio is at least 30dB, and where the background noise is quasi-stationary in nature <ref> [9] </ref>. Energy-contour methods are based on the assumption that a speech signal varies in energy at the syllabic rate, but background noise varies at a much slower rate. <p> This normalized energy contour is relatively independent of the level of background noise. Simple decision techniques, using thresholding (for on-line applications) or histograms (for off-line applications), can be applied to the normalized energy contour to accurately predict the start of a speech utterance <ref> [9] </ref>. A software implementation of an on-line energy contour speech detection algorithm requires about 0.1 MIPS of processing, for an 8 Khz speech sampling rate. Running this implementation on the reference platform would consume 125W of power; power consumption is dominated by the A/D conversion. <p> As the time constants of these secondary operations are in the millisecond range, the filterbank is the dominant source of power dissipation. 4.3 HMM-based Methods The most sophisticated speech detection algorithms integrate speech detection into a hidden Markov model (HMM) based speech recognition system <ref> [9] </ref>. In HMM-based speech recognizers, a state machine formalism is used to represent the words in the vocabulary; to add speech detection functionality, an extra state is added to the grammar to represent silence between words.

Reference-contexts: One approach to noise-robust speech detection is to compute the power spectrum of the audio signal, and apply the signal-processing operations used in energy-contour approaches (time-averaging at multiple time constants, normalization, histograms) in a frequency-dependent way. A DSP implementation of this approach <ref> [10] </ref> uses about 6 MIPS of processing; this speech detection algorithm would consume 1.6 mW of power on the reference platform. Spectrally-enhanced energy-contour algorithms are also amenable to micropower analog implementation.

Reference-contexts: To handle background noise, the front-end of the speech recognition system, which converts the audio waveform into a spectrally-based feature vector, is enhanced to generate similar feature vectors for silence and quasi-stationary noise <ref> [11] </ref>. As this speech detection approach requires running a complete speech recognition system continuously (i.e. P n = P e , using the notation of Equation 2), it is not a good candidate for use in an Anawake software emulation.

Reference-contexts: However, an application-independent grammar, that uses phonetic classes instead of vocabulary words to model speech, could be used in this speech detection architecture. Wordless grammars have been used to model arbitrary speech in a similar manner in language-identification systems <ref> [12] </ref>. An HMM-based speech-detection system, using an application-independent grammar, would be a challenging, but plausible, analog micropower design project.
