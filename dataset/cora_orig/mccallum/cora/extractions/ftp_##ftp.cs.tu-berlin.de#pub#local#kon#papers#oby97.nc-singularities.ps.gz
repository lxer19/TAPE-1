Abstract: We report the results of an analysis of orientation maps in primate striate cortex with focus on singularities and their distribution. Data were obtained from squirrel monkeys and from macaque monkeys of different age. We find that approximately 80% of singularities which are nearest neighbors have opposite sign and that the spatial distribution of singularities differs significantly from a random distribution of points. We do not find, however, evidence for consistent geometric patterns which singularities may form across cortex. Except for a different overall alignment of orientation bands and different periods of repetition, maps obtained from different animals and different ages are found similar with respect to the measures used. Orientation maps are then compared with two different pattern models which are currently discussed in the literature: Bandpass-filtered white noise, which very well accounts for the overall map structure, and the FAM-model, which specifies the orientation map by the location of singularities and their properties. The bandpass-filtered noise approach to orientation patterns correctly predicts the sign correlations between singularities and accounts for the deviations in the spatial distribution of singularities away from a random dot pattern. The FAM-model can account for the structure of certain local patches of the orientation map but not for the whole map. None of the models is completely satisfactory and the structure of the orientation map remains to be fully explained.

But another explanation is also possible. Orientation maps in macaques show a fairly stable wavelength OR at a time, when visual cortex is still growing <ref> [4] </ref>. A natural explanation of this phenomenon could be that during growth - singularities are born in opposite sign pairs which subsequently drift away from each other. <p> The fact that singularities are born in pairs could explain the sign correlations, and the fact that singularities drift away could explain the apparent repulsion. Note, that no trends have been observed between animals of different age, which is in accordance with previous findings <ref> [24, 4] </ref>. More interesting, no trends have been observed between macaques, which show ocular dominance bands, and squirrel monkeys, which do not.

Before imaging methods were available, pattern models were used to infer a two-dimensional spatial pattern from one-dimensional or sparse two-dimensional data which had been recorded with microelectrodes. Today, two-dimensional patterns can be measured directly but pattern models are still valuable tools. <p> We have chosen these two species, because macaque monkeys have ocular dominance columns while squirrel monkeys do not, and we have chosen macaques of different age in order to search for changes during development. Our experimental results are then compared with pattern models: (i) Bandpass-filtered white noise <ref> [23, 20, 8, 16, 10, 21, 9, 22] </ref>, which assumes that orientation maps can be fully described by their two-point correlation function and (ii) the FAM-model [25, 26] which claims that orientation maps are fully determined by their singularities and that the orientation map in between is optimally smooth. <p> It assumes that the orientation preference map is fully determined by the locations and signs of its singularities. Equation (12) can also be derived from a biologically more relevant smoothness criterion [26]. It has been proposed that orientation maps are characterized by the conflicting aims "continuity" and "diversity" <ref> [9] </ref> and that orientation preferences are mapped across cortex as smooth as possible under certain constraints [19]. Let us, therefore, define an appropriate cost function U , U = 2 V via the magnitude of the gradient of orientation preferences. <p> BFN has been suggested the first time by Swindale [23] and was discussed in more detail later on <ref> [20, 8, 16, 10, 22, 21, 9] </ref>, in particular by Schwartz and collegues. <p> The main reason is the large number of fractures in the BFN-maps which violate the FAM-assumptions of optimal smoothness: Iso-orientation lines in BFN maps seem to "attract" each other and form narrow regions of rapid changes in orientation preferences (see <ref> [9] </ref>, fig. 6b), while the FAM model predicts that iso-orientation lines repel each other as lines of force do.

Reference-contexts: The average wavelength OR of the orientation map was averaged over all directions in cortex neglecting the anisotropy of the orientation pattern. The density of singularities does not necesssarily correlate with the average spatial frequency, because the density also depends on the coherence properties (see <ref> [18] </ref>) of the maps. The factor of two must be introduced because orientation preferences are -periodic while the phase OE (~r) has period 2. If we adopt this mathematical description, singularities in orientation maps correspond to the zeroes of the function O (~r). <p> Later Schwartz and collegues explored those models in detail [20, 21] and demonstrated how the variety of stripe and bloblike patterns as well as the network of singularities can emerge under simple and plausible assumptions. Linsker [13], Miller et al. [15, 14] and Obermayer et al. <ref> [18] </ref> investigated models based on Hebbian learning.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Based on Hubel and Wiesels original findings [12] many experiments were performed to determine the two-dimensional lateral distribution of orientation selectivity in the upper layers of primate striate cortex [5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 17]. The results gave rise to a several pattern models <ref> [23, 20, 8, 16, 21] </ref> (for further references see [9]) designed for their interpretation. Before imaging methods were available, pattern models were used to infer a two-dimensional spatial pattern from one-dimensional or sparse two-dimensional data which had been recorded with microelectrodes. <p> We have chosen these two species, because macaque monkeys have ocular dominance columns while squirrel monkeys do not, and we have chosen macaques of different age in order to search for changes during development. Our experimental results are then compared with pattern models: (i) Bandpass-filtered white noise <ref> [23, 20, 8, 16, 10, 21, 9, 22] </ref>, which assumes that orientation maps can be fully described by their two-point correlation function and (ii) the FAM-model [25, 26] which claims that orientation maps are fully determined by their singularities and that the orientation map in between is optimally smooth. <p> BFN has been suggested the first time by Swindale [23] and was discussed in more detail later on <ref> [20, 8, 16, 10, 22, 21, 9] </ref>, in particular by Schwartz and collegues. <p> Swindale [23] was among the first to point out the relation of eq. (16) to Mexican hat shaped cortical interactions, and generated quite realistic orientation maps using BFN-type models. Later Schwartz and collegues explored those models in detail <ref> [20, 21] </ref> and demonstrated how the variety of stripe and bloblike patterns as well as the network of singularities can emerge under simple and plausible assumptions. Linsker [13], Miller et al. [15, 14] and Obermayer et al. [18] investigated models based on Hebbian learning.

Reference-contexts: The fact that singularities are born in pairs could explain the sign correlations, and the fact that singularities drift away could explain the apparent repulsion. Note, that no trends have been observed between animals of different age, which is in accordance with previous findings <ref> [24, 4] </ref>. More interesting, no trends have been observed between macaques, which show ocular dominance bands, and squirrel monkeys, which do not.

Equation (12) can also be derived from a biologically more relevant smoothness criterion <ref> [26] </ref>. It has been proposed that orientation maps are characterized by the conflicting aims "continuity" and "diversity" [9] and that orientation preferences are mapped across cortex as smooth as possible under certain constraints [19]. <p> Consequently, the FAM-model is a good model only in regions, where neither fractures nor anisotropic singularities occur. Those regions are typically below 1 mm in size. Long-range order, which has been found in maps from cat area 17 and 18 <ref> [26] </ref>, could not be detected in our primate data. BFN maps do not obey the optimal smoothness criterion and FAM reconstructions of BFN maps fail.
