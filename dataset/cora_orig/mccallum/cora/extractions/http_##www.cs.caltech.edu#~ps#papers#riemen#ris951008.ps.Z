Abstract: This paper presents a general construction of multidimensional interpolatory subdivision schemes. In particular, we provide a concrete method for the construction of bivariate interpolatory subdivision schemes of increasing smoothness by finding an appropriate mask to convolve with the mask of a three-direction box spline B r;r;r of equal multiplicities. The resulting mask for the interpolatory subdivision exhibits all the symmetries of the three-direction box spline and with this increased symmetry comes increased smoothness. Several examples are computed (for r = 2; : : : ; 8). Regularity criteria in terms of the refinement mask are established and applied to the examples to estimate their smoothness.

Reference-contexts: In fact, from the cases we have computed, it appears that with greater symmetry comes greater smoothness. Our object in the end will be to preserve the well-known symmetry structure of the box spline <ref> [1] </ref>. The existence of a function e Q implies that there is some square that will contain the support of the mask h for e H. A smaller square means smaller support for the mask h and consequently, smaller support for the refinable function. <p> But as it stands, the solutions are not uniquely determined since we have not taken into account the full symmetries of the box spline. Here we use the symmetries of the "centered" form of the box spline B r;r;r (see <ref> [1] </ref>), translated to our setting.

Reference-contexts: Once we know that ' is fundamental, then it is automatically stable, since there is C &gt; 0 so that C fi2ZZ s 6 2. The Bivariate Construction Draft 9 (see [17]). Consequently ' n converges to ' uniformly (e.g. see <ref> [3] </ref>). Suppose that the mask h defines a fundamental and refinable continuous function '. An inter-polatory subdivision scheme is defined as follows: Let c := fc ff : ff 2 ZZ s g be a sequence of control points. <p> It was shown in <ref> [3] </ref> that if ' is stable, the subdivision scheme converges. Therefore, the inter-polatory subdivision schemes discussed in this paper converge.

Therefore, the inter-polatory subdivision schemes discussed in this paper converge. Interested readers should consult [3] for details. Finally, we remark that since the refinable functions constructed here satisfy H 0 (z 2 ) = 1, it is possible to construct prewavelets from them. Interested readers should consult [17], [18] and [24] for details of the construction of prewavelets. 2.

Reference-contexts: On the otherhand, the univariate refinable and fundamental functions given in [7] and [8] are convolutions of B-splines with some distributions. Univariate refinable and fundamental functions can be derived also as the autocorrelations of refinable functions constructed in <ref> [5] </ref> in the context of wavelets; again these functions have the form of convolutions of B-splines with distributions. This indicates that multivariate functions satisfying i-iii may not necessarily be splines, but they could be convolutions of box splines with some distributions. <p> We hope to do this with good estimates on the smoothness of the resulting fundamental solution as well. To this end we take our cue from the construction of compactly supported refinable functions in the univariate case in <ref> [5] </ref> where the function e h takes the factored form 2 G (y): The left hand factor is the symbol of the refinement mask for the cardinal B-spline of order N .
