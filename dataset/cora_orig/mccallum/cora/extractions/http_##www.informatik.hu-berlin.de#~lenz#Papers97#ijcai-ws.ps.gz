Abstract: In this paper, we report about the application of Case-Based Reasoning to the task of document retrieval. We briefly describe the main features of the FA LL Q system which is the result of a cooperation with an industrial partner. The objective of the system is to provide a tool that, for a given query text, helps finding related documents, such as sections of Frequently Asked Questions databases. The system is currently under practical evaluation at our partner Keywords: Decision support, Hotline, document retrieval, Case-Based Reasoning.
