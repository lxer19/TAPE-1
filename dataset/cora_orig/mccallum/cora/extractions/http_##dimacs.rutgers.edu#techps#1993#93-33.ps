To show that jS (w) " hAj h 1, we choose w 2 W = <ref> [1; a k1 ] </ref>nA. There exists a unique t 2 [0; k 2] such that a t &lt; w &lt; a t+1 . <p> Since jIj = a k1 1 2k 4 &lt; 2k 3 = (k 1) + (k 2) = jY j + jZj; it follows that Y " Z 6= ;. Therefore, there exist i 2 <ref> [1; k 1] </ref> and j 2 [1; k 2] such that either a i = w + a k1 a j a i + a k1 = w + a k1 a j : In the first case, we have w + a k1 = a i + a j ; <p> Since jIj = a k1 1 2k 4 &lt; 2k 3 = (k 1) + (k 2) = jY j + jZj; it follows that Y " Z 6= ;. Therefore, there exist i 2 [1; k 1] and j 2 <ref> [1; k 2] </ref> such that either a i = w + a k1 a j a i + a k1 = w + a k1 a j : In the first case, we have w + a k1 = a i + a j ; w + (r + 1)a k1 <p> Case 2. Suppose that a k2 &lt; 2 (k 2) = 2k 4. Case 2a. Suppose that a i &lt; 2i for i = 1; 2; : : : ; k 2. Then 0 &lt; a 1 &lt; 2 implies that a 1 = 1. Define C = <ref> [1; 2k 4] </ref> n A 0 : Then jCj = (2k 4) (k 2) = k 2: Let c 2 C. Then c &gt; a 1 = 1. <p> Define C = [1; 2k 4] n A 0 : Then jCj = (2k 4) (k 2) = k 2: Let c 2 C. Then c &gt; a 1 = 1.

There exists a unique t 2 [1; k 2] such that a t &lt; c &lt; a t+1 : Consider the sets D 1 = fa i ji 2 <ref> [1; t] </ref>g D 2 = fc a j jj 2 [1; t]g: Then jD 1 j = jD 2 j = t and D 1 [ D 2 [1; c 1]: Suppose that t &lt; k 2. <p> Then c &gt; a 1 = 1.

Since c &lt; a t+1 &lt; 2 (t + 1) = 2t + 2; it follows that c 2t and so c 1 &lt; 2t. Suppose that t = k 2. <p> Then the condition c 2k 4 implies that c 1 2k 5 &lt; 2k 4 = 2t: In both cases we conclude that D 1 " D 2 6= ; - 17 - a i = c a j for some i; j 2 <ref> [1; t] </ref> [1; k 2]. Thus, c = a i + a j 2 2A 0 . <p> Then the condition c 2k 4 implies that c 1 2k 5 &lt; 2k 4 = 2t: In both cases we conclude that D 1 " D 2 6= ; - 17 - a i = c a j for some i; j 2 [1; t] <ref> [1; k 2] </ref>. Thus, c = a i + a j 2 2A 0 . <p> + r, and so j2Aj = 2k 1 + r = k + (k 1 + r) k + n (A): This completes the proof. 2.4 Application: Sumsets and powers of 2 Let n 1, and let B be the set of all multiples of 3 contained in the interval <ref> [1; n] </ref>. Then jBj n=3, and every sum of elements of B is divisible by 3. This implies that no such sum is a power of 2. We shall prove that the set of [n=3] multiples of 3 is the extreme case: If B [1; n] and jBj &gt; n=3, then <p> of 3 contained in the interval <ref> [1; n] </ref>. Then jBj n=3, and every sum of elements of B is divisible by 3. This implies that no such sum is a power of 2. We shall prove that the set of [n=3] multiples of 3 is the extreme case: If B [1; n] and jBj &gt; n=3, then some power of 2 can be written as the sum of a bounded number of elements of B. Theorem 2.8 Let n 1, and let B be a set of integers contained in the interval [1; n]. <p> of 3 is the extreme case: If B <ref> [1; n] </ref> and jBj &gt; n=3, then some power of 2 can be written as the sum of a bounded number of elements of B. Theorem 2.8 Let n 1, and let B be a set of integers contained in the interval [1; n]. If jBj &gt; n=3, then there is a power of 2 that can be written as the sum of at most 6 elements of B. Proof. Let n (B) denote the alrgest element of B. Since B [1; n] implies that n n (B) and since jBj &gt; n=3 <p> let B be a set of integers contained in the interval <ref> [1; n] </ref>. If jBj &gt; n=3, then there is a power of 2 that can be written as the sum of at most 6 elements of B. Proof. Let n (B) denote the alrgest element of B. Since B [1; n] implies that n n (B) and since jBj &gt; n=3 n (B)=3, we can assume that n (B) = n. Let d be the greatest common divisor of the elements of B. If d 3, then n djBj 3jBj &gt; n, which is impossible. <p> Let d be the greatest common divisor of the elements of B. If d 3, then n djBj 3jBj &gt; n, which is impossible. If d = 2, let B 0 = fb=2 j b 2 Bg <ref> [1; n=2] </ref>. Then the greatest common divisor of the elements of B 0 is 1. Moreover, n (B 0 ) = n=2 and jB 0 j = jBj &gt; n=3 &gt; n (B 0 )=3. Thus, the set B 0 satisfies the conditions of the Theorem. <p> Freiman [31] also proved Theorem 2.8 on the represention of powers of 2 as the sum of a small number of integers in certain subsets of <ref> [1; n] </ref>. A weaker result on representing powers of 2 as the sum of a bounded number of terms had been obtained earlier by Nathanson and Sark-ozy [56]. Erd-os and Freud conjectured that if A [1; n] and jAj &gt; n=3, then some power of 2 can be written as the <p> of 2 as the sum of a small number of integers in certain subsets of <ref> [1; n] </ref>. A weaker result on representing powers of 2 as the sum of a bounded number of terms had been obtained earlier by Nathanson and Sark-ozy [56]. Erd-os and Freud conjectured that if A [1; n] and jAj &gt; n=3, then some power of 2 can be written as the sum of distinct elements of A. This was proved by Erd-os and Freiman [23], Nathanson and Sark-ozy [56], and Freiman [31]. An early version of this chapter appeared in Nathanson [53]. 2.6 Exercises 1. <p> To simplify notation, we shall henceforth denote the i-th vertex set in the addition graph by A + iB. Truncated addition graphs Let n 1 and let A and B be finite, nonempty sets of nonneg ative integers such that A " <ref> [1; n] </ref> 6= ; and 0 2 B. Then V i = A + iB " [1; n] 6= ; for i = 0; 1; 2; : : :. <p> Truncated addition graphs Let n 1 and let A and B be finite, nonempty sets of nonneg ative integers such that A " <ref> [1; n] </ref> 6= ; and 0 2 B. Then V i = A + iB " [1; n] 6= ; for i = 0; 1; 2; : : :. <p> Choose a separating set S such that jSj = m and X s2S is minimal. We shall prove that S V 0 [ V h : Suppose not. Then S " V j 6= ; for some j 2 <ref> [1; h 1] </ref>. Let S " V j = fs 1 ; : : : ; s q g; where q = jS " V j j 1. <p> Since 0 &lt; j &lt; h, it follows that, for each i 2 <ref> [1; q] </ref>, the vertex s i has a predecessor r i 2 V j1 on the path i and a successor t i 2 V j+1 on the path i . <p> However, since fl cannot avoid the separating set S, it follows that s i lies on fl for some i 2 <ref> [1; q] </ref>, say, i = 1. Let r fl be the predecessor of s 1 on the path fl . <p> Then ~ (A) fl. Let G be the Plunnecke graph obtained by truncating at n the addition graph of order h generated by A and B. The i-th vertex set of the truncated addition graph is V i = (A + iB) " <ref> [1; n] </ref>: Since 1 2 A and 0 2 B, it follows that V i 6= ; for i = 0; 1; : : : ; h. Let ; 6= Z V 0 = A " [1; n]: Then Z (m; n) A (m; n) = A (n) A (m) for <p> set of the truncated addition graph is V i = (A + iB) " <ref> [1; n] </ref>: Since 1 2 A and 0 2 B, it follows that V i 6= ; for i = 0; 1; : : : ; h. Let ; 6= Z V 0 = A " [1; n]: Then Z (m; n) A (m; n) = A (n) A (m) for m = 0; 1; : : : ; n, and in the graaph G. Let z be the smallest positive element of Z. <p> Since B is a basis of order h 2, 1 2 hB and so 0 2 B. Therefore, hB + 1 = N, and (hB + 1) = 1. Applying the previous Lemma with j = 1 gives (~; B) ~ 11=h for all ~ 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Let ~ = (A). Then (A + B) (~; B) ~ 11=h = (A) : This completes the proof. Corollary 7.2 (Erd-os) Let A be a set of nonnegative integers with 0 &lt; (A) &lt; 1, and let B be a basis of order h 2. <p> Then q (a) = aq aq # for all a 2 A. Let ffi : Z ! Z=mZ be the natural map that sends a to a (mod m). We shall prove that ffi restricted to V q is a Freiman isomorphism of order h for some q 2 <ref> [1; p 1] </ref>. Let q 2 [1; p 1], and suppose that ffi : V q ! Z=mZ is not a Freiman isomorphism of order h. <p> Let ffi : Z ! Z=mZ be the natural map that sends a to a (mod m). We shall prove that ffi restricted to V q is a Freiman isomorphism of order h for some q 2 <ref> [1; p 1] </ref>. Let q 2 [1; p 1], and suppose that ffi : V q ! Z=mZ is not a Freiman isomorphism of order h. <p> There are less than 2hjDj such choices. Since a fl 6 0 (mod p), the set of integers of the form fl (a fl q (mod p)) for q 2 <ref> [1; p 1] </ref> is precisely [1; p 1], and so there are at most m + 1 m numbers q 2 [1; p 1] that satisfy the congruence (8.7). <p> There are less than 2hjDj such choices. Since a fl 6 0 (mod p), the set of integers of the form fl (a fl q (mod p)) for q 2 <ref> [1; p 1] </ref> is precisely [1; p 1], and so there are at most m + 1 m numbers q 2 [1; p 1] that satisfy the congruence (8.7). Thus, the number of triples (q; a fl ; x) is at most 4hjDj m &lt; p 1 since m &gt; 4hjDj. <p> Since a fl 6 0 (mod p), the set of integers of the form fl (a fl q (mod p)) for q 2 <ref> [1; p 1] </ref> is precisely [1; p 1], and so there are at most m + 1 m numbers q 2 [1; p 1] that satisfy the congruence (8.7). Thus, the number of triples (q; a fl ; x) is at most 4hjDj m &lt; p 1 since m &gt; 4hjDj. Therefore, at least one integer q 2 [1; p 1] occurs in none of the triples, and for this q the <p> and so there are at most m + 1 m numbers q 2 <ref> [1; p 1] </ref> that satisfy the congruence (8.7). Thus, the number of triples (q; a fl ; x) is at most 4hjDj m &lt; p 1 since m &gt; 4hjDj. Therefore, at least one integer q 2 [1; p 1] occurs in none of the triples, and for this q the map ffi : q (A) ! A=mZ is a Freiman isomorphism of order h. <p> Let A be a set of integers. Let h 2, and let N = jhA hAj. Prove that there exists a set A 00 A such that jA 00 j n=h 2 and A 00 is Freiman isomorphic of order h to a subset of <ref> [1; 2N ] </ref>. (Hint: Use Theorem 8.6.) Chapter 9 Large subsets of A fi B 9.1 Introduction Let A and B be nonempty subsets of a torsion-free abelian group, and let jAj = jBj = k. <p> Balog and Szemeredi <ref> [1] </ref> proved a theorem that implies a Freiman-type result for large subsets of A fi B: Let c 1 &gt; 0 and c 2 &gt; 0. <p> Chung [11] and Frankl and Rodl [25] have generalized the Regularity Lemma to hypergraphs. The version of Freiman's theorem for large subsets of A fi B was proved by Balog and Szemeredi <ref> [1] </ref> in the case that A = B is a finite set of integers. The somewhat more general result given in this chapter requires only minor modifications of their proof. 9.5 Exercises 1. <p> Let b; c 2 V . If then 0 2 P + ftbg for all t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The set B is called an essential component if (A + B) &gt; (A) for every set A with 0 &lt; (A) &lt; 1. Let A and B be sets of integers with 1 2 A and 0 2 B. Shnirel'man <ref> [70] </ref> proved the fundamental inequality (A + B) (A) + (B)(1 (A)): If (A) &lt; 1 and (B) &gt; 0, then (A + B) &gt; (A). Shnirel'man's inequality implies that any set B with 0 2 B and positive Shnirel'man density is an essential component.
