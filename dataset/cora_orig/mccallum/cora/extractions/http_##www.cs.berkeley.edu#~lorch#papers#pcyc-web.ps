Abstract: The CPU is one of the major power consumers in a portable computer, and considerable power can be saved by turning off the CPU when it is not doing useful work. In Apple's MacOS, however, idle time is often converted to busy waiting, and generally it is very hard to tell when no useful computation is occurring. In this paper, we suggest several heuristic techniques for identifying this condition, and for temporarily putting the CPU in a low-power state. These techniques include turning off the processor when all processes are blocked, turning off the processor when processes appear to be busy waiting, and extending real time process sleep periods. We use trace-driven simulation, using processor run interval traces, to evaluate the potential energy savings and performance impact. We find that these techniques save considerable amounts of processor energy (as much as 66%), while having very little performance impact (less than 2% increase in run time). Implementing the proposed strategies should increase battery lifetime by approximately 20% relative to Apple's current CPU power management strategy, since the CPU and associated logic are responsible for about 32% of power use; similar techniques should be applicable to operating systems with similar behavior.

Reference-contexts: However, it makes no attempt to police processes that make unfair processor time requests; in fact, one recognized problem with its power management is that if a single process requests events using PeekMessage rather than GetMessage or WaitMessage, then processor power management cannot take place <ref> [2, 9] </ref>. This problem is exactly the sort that the greediness technique was designed to alleviate, so we may find that, as we demonstrated for the MacOS, the effectiveness of the basic strategy is greatly improved by the use of such a technique.

Reference-contexts: For instance, the AT&T Hobbit and certain versions of the MC68030 and MC68040 use static logic so that most of their state can be retained when the clock is shut down [13]. Also, the PowerPC 603 can exit the low-power Doze mode in about ten system clocks <ref> [4] </ref>. Because of the short delay and low energy cost for entering and leaving a low-power state, the optimal CPU power management strategy is trivial: turn off the CPU whenever there is no useful work to do.

Reference-contexts: One might wonder why MacOS uses this inactivity timer based strategy instead of the basic strategy. One reason is that all but the most recent Macintosh computers have high overhead associated with turning off and on the processor <ref> [6] </ref>, making the basic strategy less applicable. In older processors, for example, the contents of on-chip caches were lost when the processor was powered down. <p> The first tool, IdleTracer, collects traces of events needed to simulate the different strategies, and is discussed in more detail in <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> Table 1 indicates data about the traces obtained from each user and the machines on which those traces were collected. Much more detailed discussion of the traces and their collection appears in <ref> [6] </ref>. Most results we present will concern the aggregate workload, i.e. the trace composed of the concatenation of all six of these traces. 4 Results In this section, we refer to the Current MacOS strategy as strategy C and the Basic strategy as strategy B.

Reference-contexts: For these reasons, much work has been done in reducing the power consumption of computers. In <ref> [7] </ref> and [8], we analyzed the power consumption of various Macintosh PowerBook computers, in typical use by a number of engineering users. <p> To illustrate how percent time in low-power mode would translate into overall power savings, let us consider an ex 10 ample based on estimates of power consumption from pre-vious work <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. In this example, based on the Duo 280c, turning off the processor saves 3.74 W, while the components that remain on consume, on average, 5.65 W, given current power management techniques. <p> It is unclear how much more or less effective these methods would be for some other workload; for instance, a previous study with a different workload <ref> [7, 8] </ref> found that 48.1% of processor power was saved by the current MacOS strategy. Even within the workload studied here, we have seen that the savings from each strategy varies greatly from one user to another.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, in Apple's MacOS, processes can run or be scheduled to run even when they have no useful work to do. This feature is partially by design, since in a single-user system there is less need for the operating system to act as an arbiter of resource use <ref> [10] </ref>. Partially, it is because the OS was not written with power management in mind.

Reference-contexts: Also, IdleTracer shuts off processor power management while it is tracing, so that the traces it uses are not confounded by the current strategy and thus can be used to simulate any strategy. IdleTracer makes use of the SETC <ref> [12] </ref> module, a set of routines for tracing and counting system events. The second tool, ItmSim, simulates power management methods using the current MacOS inactivity-threshold strategy, and provides a basis for comparison.
