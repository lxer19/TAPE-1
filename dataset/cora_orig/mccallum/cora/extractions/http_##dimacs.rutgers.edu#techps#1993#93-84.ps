When I was still in the dark as to the origins of the problem, Leo Khachiyan gave me a preprint of <ref> [6] </ref>; then I was led step by step to Jeff Lagarias, Mike Keane, and Michel Dekking, who provided me with additional papers on the subject. Dominique Sotteau pointed out rough spots in a draft of this note. I want to thank all of them. - 13 -
