Title: A Cooperative Coevolutionary Approach to Function Optimization  
Author: Mitchell A. Potter and Kenneth A. De Jong 
Address: Fairfax, VA 22030 USA  
Affiliation: Computer Science Department George Mason University  
Abstract: A general model for the coevolution of cooperating species is presented. This model is instantiated and tested in the domain of function optimization, and compared with a traditional GA-based function optimizer. The results are encouraging in two respects. They suggest ways in which the performance of GA and other EA-based optimizers can be improved, and they suggest a new approach to evolving complex structures such as neural networks and rule sets.

The previous work that has looked at coevolving multiple cooperative species in separate subpopulations has involved a user-specified decomposition of the problem into species (see, for example, [12] or [9]).

Reference-contexts: Classifier systems attempt to accomplish this via a single population of interacting rules whose individual fitnesses are determined by their interactions with other rules via a simulated micro-economy [11].

Reference-contexts: We hypothesize that this due to the interdependencies between the function variables introduced by the Griewangk product term, and selected an additional function (F2) from the original De Jong test suite <ref> [5] </ref> that has even stronger variable interactions than the Griewangk function. This function is called the Rosenbrock function and is defined as f (~x) = 100 (x 2 where 2:048 x i 2:048. The global minimum of zero is at the point (1; 1).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Genetic algorithms (GAs), originally conceived by Holland <ref> [10] </ref>, represent a fairly abstract model of Darwinian evolution and biological genetics. They evolve a population of competing individuals using fitness-biased selection, random mating, and a gene-level representation of individuals together with simple genetic operators (typically, crossover and mutation) for modeling inheritance of traits.
