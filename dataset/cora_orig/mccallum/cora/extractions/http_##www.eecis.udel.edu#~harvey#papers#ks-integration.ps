Title: Problems in Heterogeneous Knowledge Source Integration: TraumaGEN and the Metathesaurus  
Author: Terrence G. Harvey

Abstract: This paper reports on some of the difficulties inherent in the integration of information from heterogeneous knowledge sources (KSs). It reviews the approaches and limitations of some recent systems, and presents example problems from an attempt to integrate two KSs in the medical terminology domain.

Reference-contexts: Automation will also potentially allow TraumaGEN to benefit from improvements in the Metathesaurus, which otherwise would require human monitoring and changes. Other work Much work has been done in the area of integrating heterogeneous knowledge bases. Two systems, TSIMMIS (Chawathe et al. 1994; Hammer et al. 1997) and HER-MES <ref> (Adali & Subrahmanian 1994) </ref>, are not integration systems, but rather tools for designing integration systems. These tools automate the creation of agents, which will in turn integrate the information sources. TSIMMIS The TSIMMIS architecture consists primarily of translators and mediators. <p> TSIMMIS mediators are relatively simple. They direct queries to appropriate sources, and may eventually eliminate duplicate information or convert time stamps to a common format, though these abilities do not appear to be currently implemented. All communication to or between mediators is in OEM. HERMES HERMES <ref> (Adali & Subrahmanian 1994) </ref> is another system development tool. Like TSIMMIS, it helps users develop translators and mediators, but it appears to be a more substantial design tool, especially for mediators. HERMES separates the integration process into two parts, domain and semantic integration.

Reference-contexts: SIMS agents communicate using two languages: KQML (Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language) (Finin et al. 1994) is the meta-language used to carry information about agent desires and intentions, while LOOM <ref> (Brill 1991) </ref> semantic nets are used to represent the information "goods" passed between agents. Four steps comprise the SIMS algorithm. First, an agent selects appropriate sources for a query based on content and cost. Next, it creates a plan to retrieve and possibly process the data.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, an integration system can derive new information by examining diverse sources or verifying the contents of one database against another. In the case of TraumaGEN <ref> (Carberry & Harvey 1997) </ref>, integration was intended to allow the text planner to achieve greater coherence and conciseness through enriched semantic and lexical knowledge about medical terms. The Metathesaurus The National Library of Medicine has developed the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to aid medical system developers. <p> TraumaTIQ (Gertner & Webber 1996)is a module that compares a physician's inferred management plan with TraumAID's plan, and creates critiquing information for each significant difference between them. The set of critique information is then processed by a text planner, TraumaGEN <ref> (Carberry & Harvey 1997) </ref> that generates coherent, integrated messages. One limitation on TraumaGEN's ability to integrate messages properly is that it does not have semantic knowledge about the relations between medical concepts.

Reference-contexts: Modularity can also increase resilience and help to make systems fail-soft. Distributed agent systems have the ability to modify the number of agents, or the ratio of source agents to mediators to maintain an efficient balance when work loads change <ref> (Decker, Sycara, & Williamson 1997) </ref>. Distributed agent system architectures have also been developed to encourage independent agent specialization, so that over time agents can become "expert" in a particular domain (Decker & Sycara 1997; Decker, Sycara, & Williamson 1997; Knoblock, Arens, & Hsu 1994).

Reference-contexts: Attempts are being made to reduce the negative impacts of query re-mappings. "Planning by rewriting" (Knoblock & Ambite 1997) generates low-cost but possibly sub-optimal plans. Another effort, "recursive information gathering" <ref> (Duschka & Levy 1997) </ref> generates a maximally contained set of query rewritings (the set contains information subsets of the query, not just equivalents). By exploiting functional dependencies in the domain model, queries can be translated in time polynomial in the number of query terms.

Reference-contexts: SIMS In the SIMS (Knoblock, Arens, & Hsu 1994) architecture, each agent carries a detailed model of its own expertise, and models of the knowledge sources available to it (including other agents).

Reference-contexts: Conflicts between data will be discussed later in this paper. "Learning" in HERMES refers only to the ability to save new strategies written by the mediator author/user, when told, for incorporation into the strategy menu. The Information Manifold The Information Manifold (IM) <ref> (Kirk et al. 1995) </ref> is a system for browsing and querying multiple networked information sources. The authors focus on minimizing the number of sources queried; their algorithm guarantees the relevance of each source.

Reference-contexts: As an example, <ref> (Knoblock & Ambite 1997) </ref> present a query that retrieves ship types whose range is greater than 10,000 miles. <p> Attempts are being made to reduce the negative impacts of query re-mappings. "Planning by rewriting" <ref> (Knoblock & Ambite 1997) </ref> generates low-cost but possibly sub-optimal plans.

Reference-contexts: Unmodified, this algorithm will prevent the IM from gathering new information about the contents of the small source. It also neglects the importance of maintaining a variety of sources for accuracy checking and as back-up resources. SIMS In the SIMS <ref> (Knoblock, Arens, & Hsu 1994) </ref> architecture, each agent carries a detailed model of its own expertise, and models of the knowledge sources available to it (including other agents).

Reference-contexts: The Information Manifold uses extensive knowledge of its sources to ensure that only relevant sources are polled in its plan. It can also guarantee that a minimal number of sources were polled. Occam <ref> (Kwok & Weld 1996) </ref> claims to be a sound, complete, and efficient planner, provided that every piece of information knowable about each KS is carefully written into the meta-language.

Reference-contexts: Cached data is stored in LOOM, and is indexed with a description of the information gleaned from the initial query. The second kind of learning is Semantic Query Optimization (SQO). When the system detects an expensive query it attempts to learn (using ID3 <ref> (Quinlan 1986) </ref> ) information that will reduce the cost of similar future requests.

Reference-contexts: The value of Metathesaurus is threefold: uniform single query access to a large number of heterogeneous knowledge sources; a single concept identifier that is appropriately matched in each source; and the recording of relations that are only available across sources. TraumAID, TraumaTIQ, and TraumaGEN TraumAID <ref> (Webber, Rymon, & Clarke 1992) </ref> is a decision support system for the initial management of multiple trauma. TraumaTIQ (Gertner & Webber 1996)is a module that compares a physician's inferred management plan with TraumAID's plan, and creates critiquing information for each significant difference between them.
