Abstract: The dynamics and collective properties of feedback networks with spiking neurons are investigated. Special emphasis is given to the potential computational role of subthreshold oscillations. It is shown that model systems with integrate-and-fire neurons can function as associative memories on two distinct levels. On the first level, binary patterns are represented by the spike activity | "to fire or not to fire." On the second level, analog patterns are encoded in the relative firing times between individual spikes or between spikes and an underlying subthreshold oscillation. Both coding schemes may coexist within the same network. The results suggest that cortical neurons may perform a broad spectrum of associative computations far beyond the scope of the traditional firing-rate picture.

Reference-contexts: There are also various theoretical reasons for studying such models. First, consider the information content of a train of action potentials. Even complex cognitive tasks are often accomplished within a few hundred milliseconds <ref> [10] </ref> although they involve multiple cortical regions typically operating at firing frequencies below 50 Hertz | which means that each subnetwork has to complete its computation within a small number of firing cycles.

Reference-contexts: Second, a system using a spike-time code might allow useful computations to be performed more naturally than a rate-coding network. Hopfield <ref> [11] </ref> has proposed a model of pattern recognition in which stimulus intensities are recoded into time advances of spikes relative to a background oscillation. This is done as follows: Consider a neuron subject to a subthreshold oscillation. <p> It is thus important to investigate biologically more realistic networks with spiking neurons which may support a temporal code based on the firing of individual action potentials <ref> [11, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] </ref>. Biological neurons fire an action potential when their membrane potential u reaches a threshold value u threshold . The action potential then propagates along the axon to synapses on the dendritic trees of postsynaptic neurons. <p> This means that the value of P j2F T ij is encoded in the firing time of neuron i. To recognize a pattern one could again use a coincidence detector as proposed by Hop-field <ref> [11] </ref> within a feedforward scheme. Any such grandmother neuron only receives input from the n neurons of the network which are active in the pattern the specific grandmother neuron is coding for. The cell fires when n action potentials arrive simultaneously.
