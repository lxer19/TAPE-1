Title: Association Mining and Formal Concept Analysis  
Author: Jitender S. Deogun Vijay V. Raghavan Hayri Sever 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a connection between association queries and formal concept analysis. An association query discovers dependencies among values of an attribute grouped by other, non-primary attributes in a given relation. Formal concept analysis deals with formal mathematical tools and techniques to develop and analyze relationship between concepts and to develop concept structures. We show that dependencies found by an association query can be derived from a concept structure. Keywords- Association queries, formal concept analysis, dependency relations, concept structures.

Typically an association query strives for discovering a dependency between two subsets of values of an attribute with respect to externally defined parameters like minimum support and confidence 3 .

A viewpoint relative to a particular subset of P will show associations that contain the given subset and those included in the subset. The viewpoint is also quite useful for association mining algorithms that perform filtering step as a priori technique to eliminate low-support associations.
