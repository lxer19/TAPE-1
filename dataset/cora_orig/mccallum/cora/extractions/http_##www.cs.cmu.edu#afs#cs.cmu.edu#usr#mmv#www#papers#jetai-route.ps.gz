Abstract: Automated route planning consists of using real maps to automatically find good map routes. Two shortcomings to standard methods are (i) that domain information may be lacking, and (ii) that a "good" route can be hard to define. Most on-line map representations do not include information that may be relevant for the purpose of generating good realistic routes, such as traffic patterns, construction, and one-way streets. The notion of a good route is dependent not only on geometry (shortest path), but also on a variety of other factors, such as the day and time, weather conditions, and perhaps most importantly, user-dependent preferences. These features can be learned by evaluating real-world execution experience. These difficulties motivate our work on applying analogical reasoning to route planning. Analogical reasoning is a method of using past experience to improve problem solving performance in similar new situations. Our approach consists of the accumulation and reuse of previously traversed routes. We exploit the geometric characteristics of the map domain in the storage, retrieval, and reuse phases of the analogical reasoning process. Our route planning method retrieves and reuses multiple past routing cases that collectively form a good basis for generating a new routing plan. To find a good set of past routes, we have designed a similarity metric that takes into account the geometric and continuous-valued characteristics of a city map. The metric evaluates its own performance and uses execution experience to improve its prediction of case similarity, adaptability and executability. We present the replay mechanism that the planner uses to produce a route plan based on analogy with past routes retrieved by the similarity metric. We use illustrative examples and show some empirical results from a detailed on-line map of the city of Pittsburgh, containing over 18,000 intersections and 25,000 street segments.

Reference-contexts: If the two resulting subsegments do not appear as edges in the triangulation, they are split recursively until bthe entire segment is represented by a sequence of edges in the triangulation. The final triangulation is known as a conforming Delaunay triangulation <ref> (Bern & Eppstein 1992) </ref>, because it conforms to the case segments as well as the input vertices. The process of creating a conforming triangulation is illustrated in Figure 8.

Reference-contexts: Section 8. 2 Domain and Data Representation The information available to the planner consists of a map database, a set of operators (rules used to model changes in state or knowledge), and a case library. 2.1 The Map The map used in our work is a complete map of Pittsburgh <ref> (Bruegge et al. 1992) </ref> containing over 18,000 intersections and 5,000 streets divided into 25,000 segments (Segments typically correspond to city blocks). The map is represented as a planar graph, where the edges indicate street segments and the nodes indicate intersections.

Reference-contexts: We do not address the issues of real execution and learning, instead we use a simulated execution model. It has been claimed that complex adaptation strategies should be avoided because it is difficult to guarantee a good final solution <ref> (Liu et al. 1994) </ref>. Since our adaptation strategy is considerably more complex than in other existing case-based route planning systems, our goal in these experiments was to show that our method produces good routes for new problems. <p> Abstraction planning, such as (Branting & Aha 1995; Holte et al. 1994), is another method used in the route planning domain.

Both have extremely simple retrieval and modification algorithms, providing less transfer of prior experience than our algorithm. In particular, they cannot retrieve or compose multiple episodes, nor can they identify and exploit partial cases.

Reference-contexts: The contributions of cognitive science researchers to analogy are manifold. Different theories of analogical mapping and retrieval of analogs have been proposed that are supported by experimental data of human analogical reasoning and by computational models, as early as in the 1960s <ref> (Newell et al. 1963) </ref>. Models have mainly been used to explain human performance and to compare it with a system's performance (e.g. Falkenhainer et al. 1989, Holyoak & Thagard 1994, Kean 1990). Empirical investigations have proved that analogical reasoning is central to human thinking.

In particular our work also does not aim at capturing the human analogical reasoning process, though we ground it on the evidence that humans rely on case-based experience.

Reference-contexts: We aim at creating a solution that human users find useful and convenient. Because our system learns user preferences and responds to external changing conditions, it creates situation-dependent user-tailored routes, thereby increasing the likelihood of actually being used. We use prodigy/analogy <ref> (Veloso 1994) </ref> as the substrate for our route planning implementation. prodigy/analogy is the analogical reasoner of the prodigy planning and learning system (Carbonell et al. 1990; Veloso et al. 1995). <p> In this sense, the use of multiple cases in this domain differs from the use of multiple cases in other planning domains where different cases cover different top-level goals <ref> (Veloso 1994) </ref>. To account for the geometric characteristics of the route planning domain, we developed a sequential merging strategy to combine the cases in prodigy/analogy.
