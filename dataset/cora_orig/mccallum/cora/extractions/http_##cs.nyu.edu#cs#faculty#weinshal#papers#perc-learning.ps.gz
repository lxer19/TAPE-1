Abstract: The learning of many visual perceptual tasks, such as motion discrimination, has been shown to be specific to the practiced stimulus, and new stimuli require re-learning from scratch [1-6]. This specificity, found in so many different tasks, supports the hypothesis that perceptual learning takes place in early visual cortical areas. In contrast, using a novel paradigm in motion discrimination where learning has been shown to be specific, we found generalization: We trained subjects to discriminate the directions of moving dots, and verified that learning does not transfer from the trained direction to a new one. However, by tracking the subjects' performance across time in the new direction, we found that their rate of learning doubled. Moreover, after mastering the task with an easy stimulus, subjects who had practiced briefly to discriminate the easy stimulus in a new direction generalized to a difficult stimulus in that direction. This generalization demanded both the mastering and the brief practice. Thus learning in motion discrimination always generalizes to new stimuli. Learning is manifested in various forms: acceleration of learning rate, indirect transfer, or direct transfer [7, 8]. These results challenge existing theories of perceptual learning, and suggest a more complex picture in which learning takes place at multiple levels. Learning in biological systems is of great importance. But while cognitive learning (or "problem solving") is abrupt and generalizes to analogous problems, we appear to acquire our perceptual skills gradually and specifically: human subjects cannot generalize a perceptual discrimination skill to solve similar problems with different attributes. For example, in a discrimination task as described in Fig. 1, a subject who is trained to discriminate motion directions between 43:5 ffi and 46:5 ffi cannot use this skill to discriminate 133:5 ffi from 136:5 ffi . 1 Such specificity supports the hypothesis that perceptual learning embodies neuronal modifications in the brain's stimulus-specific cortical areas (e.g., visual area MT) [1-6]. In contrast to previous results of specificity, we will show, in three experiments, that learning in motion discrimination always generalizes. (1) When the task is easy, it generalizes to all directions after training in

Reference-contexts: The two primary directions were sufficiently different, without direct transfer between them expected. Subjects' initial performance in both directions was comparable, replicating the classical result of stimulus specific learning (no direct transfer) <ref> [3] </ref>. However, all subjects took only half as many training sessions to make the same improvement in the second direction. This shows that although perceptual learning did not directly transfer in this difficult task, it did nevertheless generalize to the new direction.

Discussion: The specificity of learning (no transfer) in difficult perceptual tasks, and evidence for the generalization (transfer) in easy tasks, led <ref> [8] </ref> to propose a two-level model: a lower level corresponding to early visual cortex, and a higher level corresponding to "cognitive" areas. In this model, learning proceeds in a linear, bottom-up or top-down fashion. <p> Thus perceptual learning is more similar to cognitive learning than previously thought, with both stimulus specificity and rule abstraction as important ingredients. These results support a more complex pattern of interactions between different levels of learning than the model in <ref> [8] </ref>. They also challenge the validity of using the specificity of perceptual learning to probe the neuronal loci of modifications in the early visual cortex, as is the purpose of many studies.
