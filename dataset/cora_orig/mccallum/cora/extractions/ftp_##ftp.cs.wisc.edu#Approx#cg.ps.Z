Abstract: Based on the method for constructing tight wavelet frames of [RS2], we show that one can construct, for any dilation matrix, and in any spatial dimension, tight wavelet frames generated by compactly supported functions with arbitrarily high smoothness.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, even for the simple dilation matrix 1 1 ; it is still unknown whether there exists a scaling function in C 1 (IR 2 ) whose integer shifts are orthonormal (cf. Cohen and Daubechies <ref> [CD] </ref> for results on this topic). Tight frames generalize orthonormal systems. They preserve the unitary property of the relevant analysis and synthesis operators, while sacrificing the orthonormality and the linear independence of the system (in order to get more flexibility).

The original proof in [RS1] requires a very mild smoothness assumption (which does not even imply continuity); but it follows from a result in <ref> [CSS] </ref> that Result 2.2 is valid without any smoothness condition. In any event, since we aim at very smooth scaling functions , we need not worry about this technical detail.

Reference-contexts: The construction details remain essentially unchanged: one only needs to modify the set T 0 , that is used in (2.10) according to the nature of the fractal used. We refer to <ref> [DDL] </ref> for a related construction. 7 Remark. A significant improvement in the above construction is available in case the matrix s satisfies a relation s m = (det s) m I; for some integer m.

Reference-contexts: Proof: Let R (!) be the n fi n-matrix whose (j; k)-entry is n 1=2 e ifl j (!+g k ) : This matrix is unitary due to the well-known orthogonality relations of group characters (cf. for instance <ref> [GH] </ref>, Lemma 5.1). This implies that (!) is unitary, too, as the product U R (!) of two unitary matrices. The lemma, when combined with Result 2.2, can be used for the construction of tight wavelet frame in the following special case.

Reference-contexts: The next two results assert now that: (a) there exist L 2 -scaling functions with mask of the form (2.4), and (b) these functions, though are not really smooth, have a minimal amount of smoothness. The first result is due to <ref> [GM] </ref>: Result 2.5. [GM: Theorem 2]. Let s be a dilation matrix, and a representer set of ZZ d =(sZZ d ).

Reference-contexts: Albeit, until very recently, tight wavelet frames were hardly considered an issue in wavelet theory; the main reason for this was the lack of a general method for the construction of useful tight wavelet frames. 1 The paper <ref> [RS1] </ref> marks a significant change in this state-of-the-art: it laid a foun-dation to the theory of wavelet frames in general, thereby to tight wavelet frames, via the new notion of quasi-wavelet frames. <p> Furthermore, in [RS2] this unitary extension principle is employed to derive various compactly supported spline tight wavelet frames in higher dimensions, i.e., tight wavelet frames based on smooth piecewise-polynomials. We show in this note that the theory of <ref> [RS1] </ref> and the construction methods of [RS2], when combined with the existing literature on self-affine tilings for general dilation matrices, lead to the following observation: given any spatial dimension d, any d fi d dilation matrix s, and any smoothness parameter k, there exists a compactly supported tight wavelet system in <p> fl) 2 F fi e entry is defined as f;fl (!) = E fl t f (!) = t f (! + fl); where E t , t 2 IR d , is the translation operator E t : f 7! f ( + t): The unitary extension principle of <ref> [RS1] </ref> then reads as follows: Result 2.2. [RS1: Corollary 6.7]. <p> Remark. The original proof in <ref> [RS1] </ref> requires a very mild smoothness assumption (which does not even imply continuity); but it follows from a result in [CSS] that Result 2.2 is valid without any smoothness condition. In any event, since we aim at very smooth scaling functions , we need not worry about this technical detail.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the paper suggests a new "unitary extension principle" that allows one, at least in theory, to derive tight wavelet frames from any multiresolution analysis, regardless of any conditions of orthonormality or linear independence of the scaling functions. Furthermore, in <ref> [RS2] </ref> this unitary extension principle is employed to derive various compactly supported spline tight wavelet frames in higher dimensions, i.e., tight wavelet frames based on smooth piecewise-polynomials.

We show in this note that the theory of [RS1] and the construction methods of [RS2], when combined with the existing literature on self-affine tilings for general dilation matrices, lead to the following observation: given any spatial dimension d, any d fi d dilation matrix s, and any smoothness parameter k, there exists a compactly supported tight wavelet system in C k (IR d ) which <p> While that seems still to be a hard problem, a partial solution was provided by an inductive method in <ref> [RS2] </ref>. The objective of this note is to show that the class of refinable functions to which the [RS2]-method can be applied to, is broad enough to include compactly supported 's of arbitrarily high smoothness. But, first, we need to provide the necessary details of the [RS2]-construction. 3 For this, let <p> As with respect to 2 , the assumption here is even milder, viz., that we only need to find a collection T 2 = (t ) t2T 2 so that jt 2 j 2 + t2T 2 The method in <ref> [RS2] </ref> provides then a unitary extension to t 0 := t 1 D fl t 2 , which is the mask of the scaling function := 1 fl D 2 (instead of the expected extension to the mask t 1 t 2 of 1 fl 2 ). <p> That observation requires only (2.7) and (2.8) above. 6 We can now easily combine Result 2.6 with the inductive method of <ref> [RS2] </ref>: we define k := fl D fl D fl : : : fl D ktimes ; with being the scaling function of Result 2.5. Then j b k (!)j = O (j!j k* ); and choosing k large enough, k has any desired smoothness.

Reference-contexts: The statement in <ref> [S] </ref> assumes that the smallest s-invariant lattice containing equals ZZ d , but can be modified to yield our stronger statement. Since this strengthening is critical for the development here, we outline below the modified proof. Proof of Result 2.6. <p> The proof now proceeds in the same manner as in <ref> [S] </ref>, with the lattice 2ZZ d there being replaced by fl ? .
