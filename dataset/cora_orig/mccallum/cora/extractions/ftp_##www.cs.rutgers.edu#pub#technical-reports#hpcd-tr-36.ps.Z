Note: The objective of the redesign is to cancel the cowl shock and the additional cowl-generated compression at the centerbody by appropriate contouring of the centerbody boundary. The original P8 inlet, designed in the early 1970s, was intended to achieve this same objective, but detailed experimental measurements indicated that a substantial reflected shock system was present.

Abstract: We have obtained several different redesigns which achieve approximate cancellation of the cowl shock and additional cowl-generated compression. The choice of the objective function, which is used to drive the optimization, has a significant impact on the final design. Several different formulations for the objective function have been employed, and improvements of 60% to 80% have been achieved.
