Title: a phase space with twice as many fermionic degrees of freedom as the Brink-Schwarz superparticle.

Affiliation: California Institute of Technology,  
Note: Inequivalence of the  Dirac's procedure is applied to the Brink-Schwarz and Siegel superparticle systems. Both systems are exhibited to have the same first-class constraints. The difference between the systems is the lack of second-class fermionic constraints in the Siegel superparticle. Thus the Siegel superparticle has  Work supported in part by the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DEAC-03-81 ER40050

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Since its discovery in 1984 the manifestly supersymmetric string action <ref> [1] </ref> has resisted quantization in a covariant gauge [2, 3, 4]. The supersymmetric particle has served as a laboratory for those wishing to practice tier methods before attacking the more complicated mechanics of the superstring. <p> The Dirac analysis is also useful in this context as it allows the true dimension of the phase space to be examined easily. In a forthcoming paper I shall describe and compare the two actions proposed as manifestly supersymmetric descriptions of the superstring <ref> [1, 9] </ref>. 2. Review of the Dirac Procedure Whenever a Lagrangian is first order in derivatives, or has a variable whose velocity does not appear, the system is said to be singular. In most cases one must be careful when quantizing a singular system.
