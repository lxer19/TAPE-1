Abstract: This paper describes a technology vision for the future that I call ubiquitous telepresence. The main idea of ubiquitous telepresence is to allow users to project their physical presence anywhere on the internet. Specifically, users are given the ability to explore and interact with many remote physical environments (e.g., all sites on the internet) through remote sensing and manipulation devices. My vision for implementing ubiquitous telepresence is to build robotic or remote-controlled units at such low cost that they become as ubiquitous as television sets. Ubiquitous telepresence extends the concept of virtual reality by providing users with a physical embodiment of their presence in a physical location. Ubiquitous telepresence is related but separate from ubiquitous computing in the model of how telepresence is provided. In particular, ubiquitous telepresense focuses on providing telepresence by defining interfaces, software, and hardware for standard low-cost robotic devices (ubots) that are connected to the World Wide Web. Instead of assuming the ubiquity of many different computing devices permeating an environment, ubiquitous telepresence requires only the presence of a single inexpensive ubot to realize its power. This vision statement describes the motivation of ubiquitous telepresence, an assessment of the technology required to realize it and the areas of research required, and its relation to existing, competing technologies. I also attempt to suggest future directions that this technology may take.

Reference-contexts: As mentioned, a significant amount of research has related to the remote operation of robots, or telerobotics. Traditionally, these efforts have been targeted at specific applications, such as waste disposal [3], hazardous environments <ref> [2] </ref>, and space exploration [7, 10]. 2 Several research groups have investigated using the internet for telerobotics, and at least three groups have already created preliminary implementations of the ubots described in this proposal.

Reference-contexts: Of the non-mobile projects that are most closely related to ours, Ken Goldberg has developed two tele-operated robots, the Mercury Project <ref> [4] </ref> and the WWW Tele-Garden [?], at least one of which has been available on the internet almost continuously since August 1994. The Mercury Project is a remotely operated robot that could direct blasts of compressed air on dry earth, allowing remote operators to view and "excavate" a location.

Reference-contexts: In particular, a Kaplan, Keshav, Schryer, and Venutolo at Bell Laboratories have mounted a video camera with a wireless transmitter onto a radio controlled car and driven the car on the internet <ref> [5] </ref>. The video is transmitted over the Internet Multicast Backbone (MBONE) and the program nv was enhanced to provide local frame rates up to 15 frames per second.

Reference-contexts: The major difference between these existing projects and our own is our emphasis on mobility and the associated problems and constraints. sniffle (Simple-Networked Interface the the Full Functionality of Laboratory Equipment) is another closely related project <ref> [6] </ref>. sniffle enables WWW clients to remotely control an arbitrary device connected to an analog/digital I/O board installed in a PC. sniffle has been applied to the problem of remotely controlling an oscilloscope device (and obtained data back from it) and is also used to pan and tilt a digital camera

Reference-contexts: While we find the use of a blimp intriguing, we are currently investigating a ground-based alternative because it appears much easier to provide in a highly available manner. Another mobile robot connected to the WWW is Xavier, created by the Learning Robots Lab (LRL) at CMU <ref> [8] </ref>. Xavier is a platform on which a large number of robotic experiments have been performed, including learning, planning, and position estimation. The focus of the LRL has been on autonomous mobile robots, and as a result, their results are only partially applicable to the UT project.
