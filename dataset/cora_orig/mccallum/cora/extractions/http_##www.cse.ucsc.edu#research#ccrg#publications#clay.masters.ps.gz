Reference-contexts: There are a variety of routing protocols that approach the problem in different ways. In some protocols, such as the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) <ref> [1] </ref> and the Protocol Independent Multicast-Dense Mode (PIM-DM) protocol [2] the receiving group is assumed to be fairly dense. In these protocols the sender initiates the multicast assuming all routers in the network are interested in receiving the transmission and, initially, the multicast is sent to all receivers. <p> Chapter 3 provides a complete description of OCBT. Chapter 5 discusses the performance of OCBT, which is analyzed by simulation and compared with CBT's performance. Chapter 4 shows the correctness and loop freedom of OCBT. Chapter 6 offers conclusions. 4 2. BACKGROUND The Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) <ref> [1] </ref> currently used in the Internet MBONE [6] forms a source-based tree from each sender and requires that each router maintain information for each source in each group.

Reference-contexts: In both the Core Based Tree (CBT) multicast protocol <ref> [3] </ref> and in the Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) protocol [4] [5], a single shared tree is created for all sender and receivers in the group, and receivers initiate their own connection to the tree. <p> Additionally, it requires routers that do not wish to be part of the multicast group to explicitly send messages to prune themselves from the tree. Within a large network with a multicast group containing many sources, the overhead required by on-tree routers can be excessive. CBT <ref> [3] </ref> [7] [8] [9] forms a backbone within a connected group of nodes called cores. The backbone is formed by selecting one router, called the primary core, to serve as a connection point for the other cores, called secondary cores. <p> The same single source was used with each receiver group. For each run of the simulation, we chose a particular set of cores using what is probably the same "trivial heuristic" used by Ballardie <ref> [3] </ref>, that is, looking at a picture of the network we picked distributed nodes of relatively high degree to serve as cores. For OCBT, the cores were divided into two logical levels. <p> The other research focus will be on using OCBT as a hierarchical protocol linking together regions that are operating some local multicasting protocol. We would like to integrate OCBT with other multicast protocols (e.g. PIM [5], HDVMRP [12], CBT <ref> [3] </ref>) at a higher or lower level. As a higher-level protocol, a single router in the local multicast group running the local protocol would be designated the OCBT node for the group. That node would then join the OCBT tree and provide connectivity for the local group.

The backbone is formed by selecting one router, called the primary core, to serve as a connection point for the other cores, called secondary cores. <p> Another partial solution to congestion over fixed links is to allow children to quit from their parents and connect on a shorter path to the core if one becomes available. This in fact was first suggested by Ballardie for CBT <ref> [7] </ref>, but has not yet been included in our simulation. Another improvement to be investigated will be to make each source a local core so that near by nodes can join directly to it, reducing the delay to those nodes.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, it requires routers that do not wish to be part of the multicast group to explicitly send messages to prune themselves from the tree. Within a large network with a multicast group containing many sources, the overhead required by on-tree routers can be excessive. CBT [3] [7] [8] <ref> [9] </ref> forms a backbone within a connected group of nodes called cores. The backbone is formed by selecting one router, called the primary core, to serve as a connection point for the other cores, called secondary cores. <p> As a loop detection mechanism, the descendent node forwards the rejoin request to its parent, and this message is passed up tree until it reaches the originating router, at which point the loop is detected and action taken to correct it. According to the current CBT protocol specification <ref> [9] </ref>, the rejoining router simply sends a quit request to its parent to remove the loop. This correction mechanism can fail, however, as the rejoining router takes no action to destroy its sub-tree and instead attempts to rejoin again, possibly along the same path forming the same loop. <p> This results in less traffic following a link failure than in CBT, in which flush messages from near a core or rejoin messages originating far from the core have to travel relatively long distances. More recent specifications for CBT <ref> [9] </ref> have a single primary core that forms a point of connection for secondary cores that stay off-tree until required to join. This single primary core is a limiting factor to the scalability of CBT, as it must receive and respond to all passive join-requests from the entire multicast tree. <p> This allowed the protocol to detect link failures before the set number of keep-alive messages were lost. 5.1 OCBT and CBT First we compared the performance of OCBT against that of the current CBT protocol <ref> [9] </ref> over the 12 different core sets shown in Figure 5.1. The results are summarized in Table 5.2. Each run shows the averaged performance of OCBT and CBT for a sparse and dense receiver group for the selected core set. <p> 3 40 26 32 33 3 40 5 33 15 7 40 26 32 33 15 9 40 26 32 33 2 10 46 11 14 24 31 45 15 30 Table 5.1: Cores used in simulation runs, we found a disconnection rate of 11.3% under the current protocol specifications <ref> [9] </ref>. Clearly, a routing protocol that is unable to find a correct path when one exists one time out of nine is hardly suitable for use in a large Internet.

Reference-contexts: Each level of cores in the scoped area could have its own local multicast address. A scheme similar to this was proposed in HPIM <ref> [10] </ref>, although this work remains unpublished apparently due to difficulties in defining the constitution of a scope and how to enforce scope limits. <p> This is true in CBT and PIM-SM as well. While determining optimal core placement remains an open problem, there have been suggestions made as to methods of migrating cores to provide better service [11] <ref> [10] </ref>. We believe that core placement can be made a matter of policy rather than optimality if the scope of the multicast is limited at each level. The flexibility of adding additional cores in OCBT supports this approach.
