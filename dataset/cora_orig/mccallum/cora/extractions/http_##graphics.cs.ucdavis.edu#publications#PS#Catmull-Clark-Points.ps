Reference-contexts: Chaikin [2] for curves; Riesenfeld [9] proceeded to show that Chaikin's curves were uniform quadratic B-spline curves; Doo and Sabin [3, 4] extended Chaikin's methods to uniform quadratic B-spline surfaces, and then extended the refinement rules for the quadratic case to meshes of an arbitrary topology; and, Catmull and Clark <ref> [1] </ref> developed the cubic case. These methods have now come into widespread use in geometric modeling. They have been used for interpolation and fairing [5], approximation [6], multiresolution design [7], and as a preprocessing step in the design process [8]. <p> These points are illustrated in our simple example below. Each point has been labeled corresponding to its calculation method (V, E, or F). 19 4. Catmull-Clark Surfaces Ed Catmull and Jim Clark <ref> [1] </ref> were the first to notice that the classification of refinement points as "face", "vertex", or "edge" points could be generalized to work with meshes of arbitrary topology.

Reference-contexts: The idea is to adapt these rules so that they can be used with a mesh of arbitrary topology. With some care, they can be developed so that, if the mesh is quadrilateral, then the surface is a B-spline. The refinement methods were first presented by George Chaikin <ref> [2] </ref> for curves; Riesenfeld [9] proceeded to show that Chaikin's curves were uniform quadratic B-spline curves; Doo and Sabin [3, 4] extended Chaikin's methods to uniform quadratic B-spline surfaces, and then extended the refinement rules for the quadratic case to meshes of an arbitrary topology; and, Catmull and Clark [1] developed
