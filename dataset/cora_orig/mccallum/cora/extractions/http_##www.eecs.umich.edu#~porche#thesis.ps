This is addressed as part of the CAR-GOES <ref> [2] </ref> project. The scope of this research is only concerned with the system level interaction between two such systems.

Reference-contexts: assure complementary relationships between intersections, we associate an intersection's strategy with just one phase of traffic in addition to the constraint that the intersection optimize for vehicles traveling on that phase only. (There is precedence for this based on what traffic engineers currently do in the process of "coordinating" intersections <ref> [3] </ref>). Consider, for example, the arterial network in Figure 4.1. The E-W major road is assumed to carry more traffic than any of the N-S minor roads.

Reference-contexts: Following the approach of Al-Malik & Gartner <ref> [4] </ref> we utilize the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) [40] delay model in Equ. 3.2. For a given interval of time C, we can approximate the allocation of green time using Equ. 3.3 and Equ. 3.4.

Reference-contexts: problem, it is important to point out the alternative approaches for determining a solution: (1) Develop a global optimization model which includes traffic signal variables (cycle size, offsets, green splits, etc.) and network flow variables and attempt to solve as one problem (referred to as the Network Design Problem), see <ref> [5, 23, 28, 49, 101] </ref>, or (2) Develop an iterative procedure that alternates between solving the traffic signal setting problem and then the equilibrium routing problem until convergence is reached. We have chosen the second approach. <p> Therefore, the statement of the problem is straightforward [but] exact solutions are hard to find." 97 In our work we address the dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) problem. Nonetheless, it is important to survey related work and to highlight the relative differences. The majority of other work <ref> [5, 8, 18, 20, 55, 56, 64, 82, 101] </ref> considers only the static traffic assignment problem.

Reference-contexts: Smith [34]. Their work uses a similar manner of iteratively optimizing signal plans and 99 dynamic traffic assignment. Furthermore, they analyze the performance of traffic respon-sive versions of several signal control techniques including Allsop's delay minimization <ref> [6] </ref>, and Webster's equisaturation [96, 97]. The work in [34] utilizes a simulation-assignment process similar to that used by Kaufman, R. Smith, and Wunderlich [45-47, 98, 99] but with traffic-responsive traffic signal controllers; these signal controllers are cycle-based, reactive (feedback controllers) signal controllers.

The common thread among such systems is the use of new technology to reduce congestion and to increase safety <ref> [9] </ref>. Many key components of an overall intelligent transportation system have been in development for years. Three of the ITS user services, as defined by ITS America, are explored in this dissertation, namely: (i) Route Guidance, (ii) Traffic Control , (iii) Public Transportation Management.

Reference-contexts: The remainder of the chapter builds an analytic model using game-theoretic notions in order to understand the convergence properties of the ALLONS-I process or any other similar process. In x 4.3 the problem of coordinated traffic signal control is formulated as a non-cooperative game <ref> [10] </ref> and a dynamic adjustment process is constructed in x 4.4 as a means to determine an equilibrium of this game. The theory of supermodular games [25, p.489] is presented in x 4.5 along with a description of a more general class of "games with strategic complementarities" [60].

Reference-contexts: Thus, the minor road traffic is not considered at all. Instead, only the complemen tary flows through the E-W phases (along the major road) are considered. 1 See Bazzan <ref> [11] </ref> for further discussion. 62 4.1.2 Organization of this Chapter In x 4.2, an iterative process called ALLONS-I is constructed in which each controller evaluates and re-evaluates its own policy. In x 4.2.3, simulation results are presented that indicate that this process only occasionally converges.

Reference-contexts: We propose the use of a game-theoretic model as a means to study conditions under which decentralized controllers can achieve the aforementioned objective. A similar goal was described by Bazzan <ref> [12] </ref>. Quoting from Friedman [24]:"Game theory provides a framework for the study of interactions of decision-makers whose interests are related, though distinctly different, and whose strategies jointly determine all outcomes." We define a game to consist of intersections in a traffic network.

Reference-contexts: In the case of flow, a single binary digit represents the presence (if 1) or absence (if 0) of an arrival at the intersection during . Such a representation of arrivals is not new as it is described by Beckmann et al. <ref> [13] </ref>. For this case, a signal policy and the flow into and out of an intersection are thus specified identically. We assume that the value for flow and green time are coincident.

Reference-contexts: Some of these are not constrained to cyclic signal plans. In general, traffic responsive systems can be differentiated along different categories including system architecture, type of signal plans developed, scope of controls and other factors. Numerous systems have been proposed. We refer the reader to <ref> [14] </ref> and [21] for an overview of these schemes. Only a small subset of these has been either field-tested or made commercially available. This survey will concentrate on these systems. Adaptive-Cyclic Systems These systems modify existing parameters like cycle-length, green split, and offset on-line.

Reference-contexts: Bell describes the usefulness of the RH approach and further recommends the use of a short roll period as being appropriate <ref> [15] </ref>. However, Newell [63] criticizes the rolling horizon strategy for traffic signal control at an isolated intersection. <p> The difficulty in accurately forecasting vehicle arrivals for any lengthy segment (or horizon) of time influences the desire for a rolling horizon implementation of these schemes. Recent studies have shown that short roll periods are sufficient <ref> [15] </ref>. How the horizon is chosen and set is a key distinguishing characteristic between various plans of this type. For example, the horizon could be a preset, fixed time period, or it could be variable in some way.

Reference-contexts: We refer to this latter situation as full backdating (FB). The manner in which travel times are recorded corresponds to the manner in which travel times can be disseminated to drivers in a network. The significance of the dissemination of this data is stated by Ben-Akiva <ref> [16] </ref>:" : : : it may be possible to provide information in such a way that a desirable distribution of network flows which reduces traffic congestion is attained.

Reference-contexts: We use this same iterative philosophy towards seeking a solution to the same problem but with dynamic assignment and adaptive signal control. The IOA algorithm reflects, to a certain degree, what currently exists for a traffic network. Consider the following description. Quoting from Dickson <ref> [20] </ref>: ": : : the procedure of alternate assignment calculations with optimization of signal timings leading to mutually consistent points is that which seems to occur naturally. <p> Therefore, the statement of the problem is straightforward [but] exact solutions are hard to find." 97 In our work we address the dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) problem.

The majority of other work <ref> [5, 8, 18, 20, 55, 56, 64, 82, 101] </ref> considers only the static traffic assignment problem. <p> Moreover, it was found by several of the aforementioned works that performance (i.e., average delay, travel time, etc.) degraded as the iterations proceeded <ref> [20, 82] </ref>. We now outline here the specifics of several research efforts that are very similar to the efforts presented in this chapter. The work of Kaufman, R.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, our problem is a shortest path problem in the decision network. Dynamic programming (DP) is an optimization procedure that would seem to be well suited to our application. DP, in general, is applicable to problems requiring a sequence of interrelated decisions <ref> [22] </ref>. Given a network, it is computationally much more efficient than a brute-force enumeration and comparison of all possible paths. Robertson and Bretherton [75] describe a backwards DP formulation which determines the optimal signal plan using predictions of queue lengths for a fixed-horizon.

Reference-contexts: In x 4.3 the problem of coordinated traffic signal control is formulated as a non-cooperative game [10] and a dynamic adjustment process is constructed in x 4.4 as a means to determine an equilibrium of this game. The theory of supermodular games <ref> [25, p.489] </ref> is presented in x 4.5 along with a description of a more general class of "games with strategic complementarities" [60]. In x 4.6, the strategies of the game players are constructed as a complete lattice. <p> This iterative method is a dynamic adjustment process that goes back to Cournot. Hence it is also referred to as a Cournot adjustment or 73 Cournot t^atonnement process <ref> [25, page 495] </ref>. In the traffic-responsive setting under consideration, an intersection responds to the traffic conditions (i.e., traffic flows) experienced as a result of the other intersections' signal policies. <p> As described by Fudenberg and Tirole <ref> [25, page 491] </ref> a supermodular game is such that the performance index has increasing differences and is supermodular over the players' strategies. Results from Topkis show that in these games each player's best response mapping will be monotone nondecreasing 7 .

Reference-contexts: The length of the horizon in ALLONS affects the computational complexity and is determined by geometry of the intersection and the arrivals into the intersections. A shorter horizon, with all other parameters fixed, reduces computational complexity. Thus, the work of Garcia and Smith <ref> [26] </ref> is relevant; it addresses the issue of determining a minimal planning horizon to ensure that the first decision is optimal.

Reference-contexts: This procedure repeats as the on-line implementation is continued. A visualization of this roll process is shown in Figure 2.12 of Chapter 2. Rolling Horizons (RH), as a strategy for on-line signal control, has been studied by several transportation researchers, and schemes such as OPAC <ref> [29, 30] </ref>, PRODYN [37], and UTOPIA [53] have been developed and tested. Bell describes the usefulness of the RH approach and further recommends the use of a short roll period as being appropriate [15]. However, Newell [63] criticizes the rolling horizon strategy for traffic signal control at an isolated intersection. <p> Calculating delay is complex. In OPAC, the number of cars in a queue multiplied by the interval of time in which the cars were queued is considered the cost to be optimized <ref> [29] </ref>. In ALLONS-D, the sum of the weighted time delay for each vehicle is considered. This allows increased priority to vehicles of a certain type or occupancy by increasing the potential delay that these vehicles may contribute if 14 slowed or stopped.

Reference-contexts: Analysis of the results yielded the following conclusions outlined by Gartner <ref> [31] </ref>. 1. Real-time modification of traditional parameters like cycle length, offset and phase split may not be appropriate for considering time varying traffic. More freedom is needed in altering the sequence and duration of phases. 2.

Reference-contexts: This explains the traditional efforts of traffic engineers to provide smooth flow on selected paths. The logic is that smooth flowing traffic reduces delays and stops (see <ref> [32] </ref>). Thus, green waves allow orchestrated platoons which are more efficient in movement [90]. Efforts to coordinate paths in a network require the traffic engineer to select certain arterials, pathways, and corridors that can be coordinated. Typically, the procedure to coordinate involves synchronizing the sequence of traffic lights involved.

Smith <ref> [34] </ref>, "It is therefore entirely reasonable to suspect that, at least occasionally, : : : , [signal] control actions taken today to reduce delays for major flows today may (if successful in reducing delay today) attract more traffic, increasing these major flows tomorrow and the day after and the day after <p> Furthermore, we consider adaptive, traffic responsive signal controllers which are not tuned using the usual control parameters of cycle length, phase split, and offset; this differs from a few related efforts which address the dynamic traffic assignment component <ref> [34, 80, 89] </ref> but only consider signal control with these parameters. A review (see Meneguzzer [56]) of those approaches utilizing an iterative method to solve the static problem points out that convergence cannot be guaranteed in general. <p> This is an important detail that will be revisited in x 5.7 (see Remark 7). Another research effort, to which our work bears some similarity is that of Ghali and M. Smith <ref> [34] </ref>. Their work uses a similar manner of iteratively optimizing signal plans and 99 dynamic traffic assignment. Furthermore, they analyze the performance of traffic respon-sive versions of several signal control techniques including Allsop's delay minimization [6], and Webster's equisaturation [96, 97]. The work in [34] utilizes a simulation-assignment process similar to <p> Smith <ref> [34] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Consider for example ramp metering [86] on freeway entrance ramps that has been proposed and implemented as a means to improve flow [44]; it is likely that comprehensive automated highway systems will incorporate this concept 1 . Freeway entrance ramps are commonly located immediately downstream of signalized intersections <ref> [35] </ref>, thus causing an effect on the surface street network interfacing with it. The manner of metering referred to here is that which seeks to dynamically optimize flow on freeways by regulating the traffic admission rate.

Reference-contexts: In the ALLONS-D scheme, the horizon is finite and tractable and thus the investigation of a stopping rule as suggested by Garcia and Smith is not considered here. 30 2.13 Discussion: Comparison to A fl The A fl algorithm initially proposed in <ref> [36] </ref> can be used to solve the shortest path in a network. The algorithm relies on obtaining an estimate of the "cost-to-go" (h (n)), i.e., a cost to reach the end node from the current node n. The ALLONS algorithm computes the optimal policy.

Reference-contexts: This procedure repeats as the on-line implementation is continued. A visualization of this roll process is shown in Figure 2.12 of Chapter 2. Rolling Horizons (RH), as a strategy for on-line signal control, has been studied by several transportation researchers, and schemes such as OPAC [29, 30], PRODYN <ref> [37] </ref>, and UTOPIA [53] have been developed and tested.

However, Newell [63] criticizes the rolling horizon strategy for traffic signal control at an isolated intersection. <p> ff; 0 ff 1: No further attempt is made to develop *() in this dissertation; its use does not affect optimality but could improve the computational efficiency of the search under varying traffic conditions. 2.8 Comparison with Dynamic Programming Approaches 2.8.1 Forward Dynamic Programming Other traffic control schemes like PRODYN <ref> [37] </ref> and COP [76] rely on a forward dynamic programming approach to find a policy that minimizes an approximation of vehicle delay. Thus we are motivated to provide a comparison of the ALLONS-D optimal search procedure, namely the ALLONS algorithm, to a standard forward dynamic programming approach. <p> Automatic coordination procedures are usually unique to each system. Both adaptive cyclic schemes SCATS and SCOOT have coordination schemes that involve setting common cycle lengths and determining offsets. Adaptive-Noncyclic Systems like UTOPIA [54], PRODYN <ref> [37] </ref>, SPPORT [100], and OPAC [27] attempt to optimize traffic on-line without being confined to a cyclic signal plan | although a cyclic plan is not a prohibited result.

Reference-contexts: The span at each node is equal to the number of phases for the intersection. An attempt to find the system optimal signal plan for the entire network at once, using an analogous decision tree structure, would be an impractical real-time search (see Kelly <ref> [48] </ref>). The vast number of states anticipated in such a decision tree (see Figure 3.1) seemingly precludes such an approach. For example, assume that such a tree is built where each arc represents the decision at each intersection in an N -intersection network for some discrete interval of time. <p> An effort to achieve the system optimal control actions in this manner was not pursued as it is believed that this problem becomes intractable as soon as m is more than four or five <ref> [48] </ref>. The remainder of this chapter develops an alternative means of seeking coordination. 3.2 Implicit Coordination of a Local Responsive Scheme There is an implicit coordination among intersections in the ALLONS-D architecture that occurs without receiving explicit coordination commands.

Reference-contexts: problem, it is important to point out the alternative approaches for determining a solution: (1) Develop a global optimization model which includes traffic signal variables (cycle size, offsets, green splits, etc.) and network flow variables and attempt to solve as one problem (referred to as the Network Design Problem), see <ref> [5, 23, 28, 49, 101] </ref>, or (2) Develop an iterative procedure that alternates between solving the traffic signal setting problem and then the equilibrium routing problem until convergence is reached. We have chosen the second approach.

Reference-contexts: The optimization algorithm of ALLONS, in combination with a Rolling Horizon implementation, suggests the relevance of the minimum first arc problem that is considered by Lark, White, and Syverson <ref> [50] </ref>. ALLONS is not limited to implementing only the first decision of an optimal policy before rolling. But, if a means to determine the best first decision without finding the entire policy is possible, then a more efficient search algorithm for the implementation used in this chapter is possible. <p> The computational speed of the existing algorithm is sufficient. Hence, this approach was not pursued. However, to pursue the approach described in <ref> [50] </ref>, the appropriate heuristic function h (n) that would be required is not obvious for the signal control problem described in this chapter. The length of the horizon in ALLONS affects the computational complexity and is determined by geometry of the intersection and the arrivals into the intersections.

Reference-contexts: Comparative statics analysis refers to the determination of an equilibrium for any given changes to a model with respect to its parameters. Specifically, quoting from <ref> [59] </ref>: "Monotone comparative statics refers to conclusions that specific variables increase or decrease as the parameters change". <p> Example 3 Let = 10101010 and ~ = 01010101 for ; ~ 2 P1.

Reference-contexts: The theory of supermodular games [25, p.489] is presented in x 4.5 along with a description of a more general class of "games with strategic complementarities" <ref> [60] </ref>. In x 4.6, the strategies of the game players are constructed as a complete lattice. Using the concepts formally defined in x 4.7, we show how this lattice is used as a partially ordered set of signal policies or strategies. <p> We must also say that components of a particular strategy are complements amongst themselves. This requires that the performance index exhibit the supermodularity property; this property would be automatically satisfied if the strategy were represented by a single component. Supermodularity also has a weaker form called quasi-supermodularity. Quoting from <ref> [60] </ref>: "Quasi-supermodularity expresses a weak kind of complementarity between the [components of a strategy]; if an increase in some subset of the [components] is desirable at some level of the remaining [components], it will remain desirable as the remaining [components] increase." We can now define Supermodular Games which were initially described <p> Results from Topkis show that in these games each player's best response mapping will be monotone nondecreasing 7 . The weaker conditions of quasi-supermodularity and SXP, described by Milgrom and Shannon <ref> [60] </ref>, define a more general class of games referred to as games of strategic comple-mentarities. In this class of games, the performance index satisfies the quasi-supermodular condition over the set of policies and the single crossing property (SXP) with regard to policies and flow. <p> It should be noted that supermodularity implies quasi-supermodularity and increasing differences implies the single crossing property <ref> [60] </ref>. <p> is upper semi-continuous in its strategy (with strategies of opposing players fixed) and upper semi-continuous in opposing players' strategies (with its strategy fixed); 3. the payoff function is supermodular in its strategies and has increasing differences over its strategies and the strategies of all other opposing players. 82 Definition 14 <ref> [60, p.175] </ref> Games with strategic complementarities are defined as games where: 1. the strategy space is a compact lattice; 2. the payoff function for a player is upper semi-continuous in its strategy (with strategies of opposing players fixed) and upper semi-continuous in opposing players' strategies (with its strategy fixed); 3. the <p> The purpose of identifying these properties in Performance Index 2 is to apply the following Monotonicity theorem.

However, Newell <ref> [63] </ref> criticizes the rolling horizon strategy for traffic signal control at an isolated intersection. <p> Thus, the horizon is rolled forward one step at a time. This is illustrated in Figure 2.12. Newell <ref> [63] </ref> criticizes the rolling horizon strategy for traffic signal control at an isolated intersection. His analysis is carried out assuming a cyclic system. However, ALLONS-D is a scheme not confined to periodic signal plans. <p> His analysis is carried out assuming a cyclic system. However, ALLONS-D is a scheme not confined to periodic signal plans. Specifically, Newell argues against extending a green time on a phase in which the current queue has dissipated. Quoting the conjecture provided in <ref> [63] </ref>: "If one switches a signal before a queue vanishes, the residual vehicles must be served sometime. <p> We note that this is in contrast with the constrained search approach of OPAC described in the literature. With regard to the variable horizon length of ALLONS-D, as Newell <ref> [63] </ref> points out, existing control schemes utilizing RH attach a penalty, or terminal cost at the end of the horizon to reduce the likelihood that some queues will never be served (among other reasons).

Reference-contexts: We call this search strategy the ALLONS algorithm. The search essentially uses a depth-first branch-and-bound technique and is done in two parts. The first part is a depth-first search to find an initial path in the tree. The second part is a backtracking <ref> [67] </ref> procedure. Specifically, the tree is searched by continually exploring nodes at increasing depths until an end node is reached. An end node is a state where the stopping criterion is met. This is equivalent to having all anticipated 17 arriving vehicles on each link cleared from the intersection.

Reference-contexts: The systems SCATS and SCOOT are prime examples. The SCOOT (Split, Cycle and Offset Optimizer) system attempts an incremental optimization of cycle time, phase split, and offset, and it is based on a platoon dispersion and queue profile traffic model similar to that of the off-line scheme TRANSYT <ref> [74] </ref>. SCATS (The Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System) optimizes cycle length, phase split, and offset based on the highest degree of saturation in the traffic network.

Reference-contexts: Computerized systems were put in place to perform real-time control of traffic lights for individual intersections and replace usual fixed signals. (Robertson and Bretherton used a means to calculate optimal signal plans in <ref> [75] </ref> which suggested that fixed-time coordinated signal policies could be improved with a measure of adaptive control.) The performance of these supposedly advanced systems were judged to be unspectacular relative to signal plans generated using existing off-line rules and methods of traffic engineers. <p> DP, in general, is applicable to problems requiring a sequence of interrelated decisions [22]. Given a network, it is computationally much more efficient than a brute-force enumeration and comparison of all possible paths. Robertson and Bretherton <ref> [75] </ref> describe a backwards DP formulation which determines the optimal signal plan using predictions of queue lengths for a fixed-horizon. In comparison, ALLONS is a depth-first branch-and-bound (DFBB) algorithm with STLC branch ordering (which steps forward in time).

Reference-contexts: 1: No further attempt is made to develop *() in this dissertation; its use does not affect optimality but could improve the computational efficiency of the search under varying traffic conditions. 2.8 Comparison with Dynamic Programming Approaches 2.8.1 Forward Dynamic Programming Other traffic control schemes like PRODYN [37] and COP <ref> [76] </ref> rely on a forward dynamic programming approach to find a policy that minimizes an approximation of vehicle delay. Thus we are motivated to provide a comparison of the ALLONS-D optimal search procedure, namely the ALLONS algorithm, to a standard forward dynamic programming approach. <p> This is a sort of feed-forward control and it requires detectors upstream of the stop line (See Fig. 2.1). Coordination efforts may or may not be involved. Another proposed scheme similar to ALLONS-D is COP (Controlled Optimization of Phases) <ref> [76] </ref>. It is a decentralized adaptive control scheme for an intersection that assumes 34 that detectors will predict vehicle arrivals sufficiently so that a forward dynamic program can determine an optimal signal plan.

Reference-contexts: Tests with low levels of congestion and minimum interrelation between the links were more likely to converge. This coincides with analytic convergence conditions that assume separable link cost functions 1 (among other conditions). Generally, the conditions for convergence and unique convergence (see <ref> [38, 39, 78] </ref>) are strict and may not be reasonable for any realistic model of a signalized traffic network 2 . Moreover, it was found by several of the aforementioned works that performance (i.e., average delay, travel time, etc.) degraded as the iterations proceeded [20, 82].

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, we consider adaptive, traffic responsive signal controllers which are not tuned using the usual control parameters of cycle length, phase split, and offset; this differs from a few related efforts which address the dynamic traffic assignment component <ref> [34, 80, 89] </ref> but only consider signal control with these parameters. A review (see Meneguzzer [56]) of those approaches utilizing an iterative method to solve the static problem points out that convergence cannot be guaranteed in general.

Reference-contexts: This explains the traditional efforts of traffic engineers to provide smooth flow on selected paths. The logic is that smooth flowing traffic reduces delays and stops (see [32]). Thus, green waves allow orchestrated platoons which are more efficient in movement <ref> [90] </ref>. Efforts to coordinate paths in a network require the traffic engineer to select certain arterials, pathways, and corridors that can be coordinated. Typically, the procedure to coordinate involves synchronizing the sequence of traffic lights involved. For cyclic traffic signals, there are various methods to achieve this.

Reference-contexts: A rolling horizon implementation is often used for traffic control schemes that depend on the prediction of vehicle arrivals. A rolling horizon (or rolling schedule) is a concept that originated in operations research. It is used to determine a short term policy based on a long term analysis <ref> [94] </ref>. In general, a rolling horizon is defined over a time period in which vehicle arrivals occur. For the rolling horizon concept, only a portion (the head) of the best plan found is actually implemented at the intersection.

Reference-contexts: For example, two one way streets that meet at an intersection consist of two phases. Traffic flowing from each street constitutes a distinct phase and right-of-way. 1.4.1 Webster's Method One of the first ideas for fixed cycle traffic control was presented by F.V. Webster. Webster's method <ref> [96] </ref> provides a formula for the efficient partition of the green time at a fixed cycle time intersection. Furthermore, Webster provides a formula for a `good' cycle time T cycle . Webster's method is a rule of thumb for minimizing the delay at an intersection. <p> Smith [34]. Their work uses a similar manner of iteratively optimizing signal plans and 99 dynamic traffic assignment. Furthermore, they analyze the performance of traffic respon-sive versions of several signal control techniques including Allsop's delay minimization [6], and Webster's equisaturation <ref> [96, 97] </ref>. The work in [34] utilizes a simulation-assignment process similar to that used by Kaufman, R.

Reference-contexts: This method of determination of the traffic assignment using travel times observed by a computer simulation is called the Simulation-Assignment method. The traffic simulator we use is called the Simple Traffic Network Simulator (STNS). Our approach is motivated by the approach of Kaufman, R. Smith, and Wunderlich <ref> [45-47, 98, 99] </ref> in their work on iterative methods for finding solutions to the dynamic traffic assignment problem. The process starts with an initial assignment, and the sequence of simulations and subsequent re-assignments is performed until two successive flow patterns are equivalent. <p> Our research combines the motivations of Ghali and M. Smith with those of Kaufman, R. Smith, and Wunderlich <ref> [45-47, 98, 99] </ref>. A prediction of traffic flow, given a fixed origin-destination demand, is sought that accounts for using a particular adaptive signal control strategy. Specifically, we use the signal control scheme ALLONS-D [72] that was presented in Chapter 2. <p> We now outline here the specifics of several research efforts that are very similar to the efforts presented in this chapter. The work of Kaufman, R. Smith, and Wunderlich <ref> [45-47, 98, 99] </ref> uses an iterative process to calculate a dynamic user-equilibrium solution to the DTA problem; however, we consider adaptive signal control whereas their work considers fixed periodic signal plans. <p> It is formed by a row for each time increment and a column for each origin-destination pair. Definition 16 is similar to that used by M. Smith [79]. The iterative scheme used by Kaufman, R. Smith, and Wunderlich <ref> [45-47, 98, 99] </ref> was called Simulation of Anticipatory Vehicle Network Traffic (SAVaNT). Their work used a meso-scopic version of the INTEGRATION [87] software simulator. Traffic signals settings were pre-determined and fixed and thus not a consideration. Neither experimental nor analytic results could be proved to guarantee convergence. <p> Check for convergence by comparing F n1 and F n . 5. If no convergence goto 2. In our work, travel times on links are reported by the STNS simulator by vehicles that exit the links; unlike in the work of Kaufman, R. Smith, and Wunderlich <ref> [45-47, 98, 99] </ref>, these values are not smoothed from one report to the next. Rather, the time varying travel time on a link can have an abrupt change relative to its most recent update for the link. <p> Furthermore, they analyze the performance of traffic respon-sive versions of several signal control techniques including Allsop's delay minimization [6], and Webster's equisaturation [96, 97].

There is no claim of guaranteed convergence for the process that yielded the experimental results reported by Ghali and M.

In this regard, the routing algorithm proceeds similarly to those in <ref> [34, 41, 98] </ref>. 102 5.4 Simulation Tests with Zero Backdating In this section, we present several simulation results of the IOA process depicted in Fig. 5.1. First, a "T-Network" is considered; it is shown in Figure 5.2. The network traffic load is generated at a fixed rate for twenty minutes.

Hence Theorem 8 and subsequent results are inapplicable. In <ref> [99] </ref>, the amount of backdating is denoted by the variable ffi, i.e., zero backdating ffi = 0 and full backdating ffi = 1. This was decreased further below zero as a tool to force SAVaNT to converge.

Reference-contexts: Automatic coordination procedures are usually unique to each system. Both adaptive cyclic schemes SCATS and SCOOT have coordination schemes that involve setting common cycle lengths and determining offsets. Adaptive-Noncyclic Systems like UTOPIA [54], PRODYN [37], SPPORT <ref> [100] </ref>, and OPAC [27] attempt to optimize traffic on-line without being confined to a cyclic signal plan | although a cyclic plan is not a prohibited result.

Reference-contexts: problem, it is important to point out the alternative approaches for determining a solution: (1) Develop a global optimization model which includes traffic signal variables (cycle size, offsets, green splits, etc.) and network flow variables and attempt to solve as one problem (referred to as the Network Design Problem), see <ref> [5, 23, 28, 49, 101] </ref>, or (2) Develop an iterative procedure that alternates between solving the traffic signal setting problem and then the equilibrium routing problem until convergence is reached. We have chosen the second approach. <p> Therefore, the statement of the problem is straightforward [but] exact solutions are hard to find." 97 In our work we address the dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) problem. Nonetheless, it is important to survey related work and to highlight the relative differences. The majority of other work <ref> [5, 8, 18, 20, 55, 56, 64, 82, 101] </ref> considers only the static traffic assignment problem.
