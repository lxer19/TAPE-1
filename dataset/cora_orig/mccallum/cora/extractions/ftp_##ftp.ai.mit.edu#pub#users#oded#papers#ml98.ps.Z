Abstract: Multiple-Instance learning is a way of modeling ambiguity in supervised learning examples. Each example is a bag of instances, but only the bag is labeled not the individual instances. A bag is labeled negative if all the instances are negative, and positive if at least one of the instances in positive. We apply the Multiple-Instance learning framework to the problem of learning how to classify natural images. Images are inherently ambiguous since they can represent many different things. A user labels an image as positive if the image somehow contains the concept. Each image is a bag, and the instances are various sub-regions in the image. From a small collection of positive and negative examples, we can learn the concept and then use it to retrieve images that contain the concept from a large database. We show that the Diverse Density algorithm performs well in this task, that simple hypothesis classes are sufficient to classify natural images, and that user interaction helps to improve perfor mance.

Reference-contexts: This problem is harder than even noisy supervised learning because the ratio of negative to positive instances in a positively-labeled bag (the noise ratio) can be arbitrarily high. The multiple-instance learning model was only recently formalized by <ref> [ Dietterich et al., 1997 ] </ref> , where they develop algorithms for the drug activity prediction problem.

Reference-contexts: Many of the existing image-querying systems work on entire images or in user-specified regions by using distribution of color, texture and structural properties. The QBIC system <ref> [ Flickner et al., 1995 ] </ref> is an example of such a system. Some recent systems that try to incorporate some spatial information into their color feature sets include [ Smith and Chang, 1996, Huang et al., 1997, Belongie et al., 1998 ] .

Reference-contexts: We investigate a method for learning visual concepts that encode the properties of a scene class from a small set of positive and negative examples. Extracted concepts are simple templates that capture some color and spatial properties of the class. Work by Lipson <ref> [ Lipson et al., 1997 ] </ref> illustrates that sim ple, hand-crafted templates that describe the relative color and spatial properties in an image can be used successfully to classify natural scenes like fields, snowy mountains and waterfalls. In this paper we show that these templates can be learned. <p> Most of these techniques require the user to specify the salient regions in the query image. One of the goals of our system is to learn the relevant color and spatial properties that best describe a particular class of natural scenes. More recently, work by Lipson and Sinha ( <ref> [ Lipson et al., 1997 ] </ref> ) in scene classification illustrates that predefined flexible templates that describe the relative color and spatial properties in the image can be used effectively for this task.

The test set consists of 80 mountains, 80 fields, and 80 waterfalls. It is disjoint from the training set.

Reference-contexts: We describe a framework for learning scene-class concepts that can be used effectively for the task of content-based image retrieval from large databases. The learning framework we use in this paper is called Multiple-Instance learning [ Di-etterich et al., 1997 ] , <ref> [ Maron and Lozano-Perez, 1998 ] </ref> . In this framework, examples are not labeled examples, but are labeled bags. Each bag is a collection of instances (Figure 1). <p> We use this framework to model the ambiguity in mapping an image to many possible templates which describe the image. Specifically, every image is a bag, and each possible template for describing the image is one instance in the bag. We discuss a method called Diverse Density <ref> [ Maron and Lozano-Perez, 1998 ] </ref> for learning concepts from Multiple-Instance examples. We test our approach on images from the COREL photo library. We show that the system is succesful even when the hypothesis class involves very simple templates, and even when the images are sampled very coarsely. <p> 1998 ] , who showed that it is difficult to PAC-learn in the Multiple-Instance model unless very restrictive independence assumptions are made about the way in which examples are generated.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we would like to learn such concepts for natural images given a small set of positive and negative examples. All of the systems described above require users to specify precisely what they want. Minka and Pi-card <ref> [ Minka and Picard, 1996 ] </ref> introduced a learning component in their system by using positive and negative examples which let the system choose image groupings within and across images based on color and texture cues; however, their system requires the user to label various parts of the scene, where as

Promising work by Rubner <ref> [ Rubner et al., 1998 ] </ref> on the earth mover's distance provides a metric that overcomes the binning problems of existing definitions of distribution distances for indexing. Most of these techniques require the user to specify the salient regions in the query image.
