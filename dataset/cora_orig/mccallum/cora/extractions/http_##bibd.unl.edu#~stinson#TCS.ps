Abstract: In 1993, Beimel and Chor presented an unconditionally secure interactive protocol which allows a subset of users in a network to establish a common key. This scheme made use of a key predistribution scheme due to Blom. In this paper, we describe some variations and generalizations of the Beimel-Chor scheme, including broadcast encryption schemes as well as interactive key distribution schemes. Our constructions use the key predistribution scheme of Blundo et al, which is a generalization of the Blom scheme. We obtain families of schemes in which the amount of secret information held by the network users can be traded off against the amount of information that needs to be broadcast. We also consider lower bounds for protocols of these types, using the concept of entropy as our main tool. Some of our schemes are optimal (or close to optimal) with respect to the bounds we prove. fl A preliminary version of this paper, entitled "Trade-offs Between Communication and Storage in Unconditionally Secure Schemes for Broadcast Encryption and Interactive Key Distribution", was presented at CRYPTO '96, and appears in the proceedings of that conference in Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 1109, pp. 387-400, Springer-Verlag, 1996.

Reference-contexts: Of course there many such schemes that are computationally secure, going back to the Diffie-Hellman scheme. (One nice conference scheme was recently described by Burmester and Desmedt [6].) Unconditionally secure schemes for conference key agreement have been studied by Beimel and Chor <ref> [1, 2] </ref> (see also Blundo and Cresti [5]). We will call such a scheme an Interactive Key Distribution Scheme (IKDS). <p> One situation in which this would be very appropriate is if the key that is being established is a (long-term) master key. We should also note, however, that one-time schemes can generally be modified in a straightforward way to obtain t -time schemes; see <ref> [1, 5] </ref>, for example. Our new schemes allow a trade-off between communication and storage. In general, a smaller broadcast size can be accomplished if the participants have more secret information, and vice versa. One of the main purposes of this paper is to examine and quantify these trade-offs. <p> Also, it is not hard to see that H (K P ) = log p H (U i ) = t + w 1 ! for 1 i n. We will now prove an important property of this scheme, generalizing <ref> [1, Lemma 9] </ref>. This result is based on the following lemma. Lemma 3.1 Suppose we have a (t; w)-KPS on a set U of n users. <p> Remark: In the case ` = 2, this is the result stated in <ref> [1, Lemma 9] </ref>. 7 4 One-time Broadcast Encryption Schemes 4.1 A Construction using Resolvable Designs In this section, we present a construction for OTBES that makes use of the combinatorial structures called "resolvable designs". We briefly recall some definitions and results from design theory that we will use. <p> We will use the model described by Beimel and Chor in <ref> [1] </ref>. P is the set of privileged subsets and F is the set of forbidden subsets, as before. There is an initial distribution of secret information by the TA, followed by a sequence of messages broadcast by the members of a privileged set P 2 P. <p> 3 3;2 = 2: This determines the values that are broadcast by user 3: b 3 = (m 3 1 + k f3;4;5g;1 ; m 3 m 3 3 + k f1;3;5g;2 ; m 3 We observe that our construction reduces to the OTIKDS presented by Beimel and Chor in <ref> [1] </ref> when we choose ` = 2. Also, we can modify the scheme in straightforward manner by using the polynomial interpolation idea of Section 4.3 instead of the resolvable design approach of Section 4.1.

Reference-contexts: Of course there many such schemes that are computationally secure, going back to the Diffie-Hellman scheme. (One nice conference scheme was recently described by Burmester and Desmedt [6].) Unconditionally secure schemes for conference key agreement have been studied by Beimel and Chor <ref> [1, 2] </ref> (see also Blundo and Cresti [5]). We will call such a scheme an Interactive Key Distribution Scheme (IKDS). <p> Each of these keys is used to encrypt one element of Z p , and thus these keys function as a big one-time pad. A formal proof of the security of the scheme can be obtained by a straightforward modification of the one given in <ref> [2] </ref>. 9 4.3 A Construction using Polynomial Interpolation In this section, we describe a variation of the scheme which allows us to remove the con-gruential condition t 0 mod `. This is accomplished by using polynomial interpolation in place of the resolvable design from Section 4.1. <p> Beimel and Chor proved a lower bound on r i in <ref> [2] </ref>. We record this bound as follows. Theorem 7.1 In any (t; w)-OTIKDS, r i 1 + w - 7.2 The Entropy of our Schemes We look now at our construction for (t; w)-OTIKDS.

Reference-contexts: One solution is to use a Key Predistribution Scheme (KPS) in which secret information is given to each user by a trusted authority in such way that specified privileged subsets can compute a secret key. One such scheme was described by Blom <ref> [3] </ref>, in which there is a secret key associated with each pair of users. By giving each user w + 1 pieces of secret information, any of the resulting secret keys is unconditionally secure against a coalition of size w. <p> we will be considering OTBES where privileged sets have size t and forbidden sets have size (at most) w; the notation (t; w)-OTBES will be used to describe this scenario. 4 3 The Blundo et al KPS and its Properties We will be using the key predistribution scheme of Blom <ref> [3] </ref>, and the generalization of Blundo et al [4], so we give a brief description of these schemes now.

Reference-contexts: By giving each user w + 1 pieces of secret information, any of the resulting secret keys is unconditionally secure against a coalition of size w. A generalization of Blom's method can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>, and a survey of key predistribution schemes can be found in [10]. <p> The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we formally define key predistribution schemes and broadcast encryption schemes in terms of the entropy function. In Section 3 we give a brief description of the key predistribution scheme in <ref> [4] </ref>. In Section 4 we present two constructions for one-time broadcast encryption schemes. <p> Our model is essentially the same as the one in <ref> [4] </ref>. It consists of a trusted authority (TA) and a set of users U = f1; 2; : : : ; ng. We assume that network is a broadcast channel, i.e., any information transmitted by the TA (or by a user in the network) will be received by every user. <p> have size t and forbidden sets have size (at most) w; the notation (t; w)-OTBES will be used to describe this scenario. 4 3 The Blundo et al KPS and its Properties We will be using the key predistribution scheme of Blom [3], and the generalization of Blundo et al <ref> [4] </ref>, so we give a brief description of these schemes now. <p> g i j (s i 1 ; : : : ; s i j1 ; s i j+1 ; : : : ; s i t ) mod p: It can be shown that no subset of w users disjoint from P can compute any information about k P (see <ref> [4] </ref>). Also, it is not hard to see that H (K P ) = log p H (U i ) = t + w 1 ! for 1 i n. We will now prove an important property of this scheme, generalizing [1, Lemma 9].

(Unconditionally secure) broadcast encryption was first introduced by Fiat and Naor [8], and has been further studied in <ref> [5, 10] </ref>.

Unconditionally secure schemes for conference key agreement have been studied by Beimel and Chor [1, 2] (see also Blundo and Cresti <ref> [5] </ref>). We will call such a scheme an Interactive Key Distribution Scheme (IKDS). An IKDS typically consists of a key predistribution phase (which requires a trusted authority), followed by an interactive communication phase among the conference participants (which does not involve the trusted authority). <p> One situation in which this would be very appropriate is if the key that is being established is a (long-term) master key.

We describe the model from [10] (a slightly different model, which is not a one-time scheme, is presented in <ref> [5] </ref>). In our model, there is an initial set-up phase in which the TA distributes secret information to the network users, just as in a key predistribution system. As before, we denote the secret information given to user i by u i .

Reference-contexts: If B consists of all k-subsets of V , then (V; B) is called the complete k-uniform hypergraph on V . We will employ the following famous theorem of Baranyai, a proof of which can be found in <ref> [9, Theorem 36.1] </ref>, for example. Theorem 4.1 (Baranyai's Theorem) The complete k-uniform hypergraph on n points is resolvable if n 0 mod k. We note that the resolutions of the designs in Theorem 4.1 can be found efficiently. We are going to construct a (t; w)-OTBES.
