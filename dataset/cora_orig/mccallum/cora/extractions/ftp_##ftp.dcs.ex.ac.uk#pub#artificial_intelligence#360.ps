Title: Representing arc labels in DNA algorithms

Abstract: DNA computing has recently generated much interest as a result of pioneering work by Adleman and Lipton, who described DNA algorithms for solving problems considered NP-hard by computer scientists. Their DNA algorithms worked on graph representations of the problem, but no indication was provided about how information on the arcs between nodes on a graph could be handled. The aim of this paper is extend the basic DNA algorithmic techniques of Adleman and Lipton by demonstrating a method for representing simple arc information | in this case, distances between cities in a simple map. The work described here significantly advances our understanding of DNA computational processes and identifies the potential for DNA algorithms for addressing problems in the NP class.
