Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Combinatorial game theory was axiomatized by Conway [Con76] and was developed by Berlekamp, Conway and Guy <ref> [BCG82] </ref>. It has provided insight into many mathematical games (including games on graphs, Nim variants and Sprouts) as well as some more popular games (most notably, Dots & Boxes). More recently, Conway's theory has been applied to Go, a game popular throughout the world. [BW94a, Ch. 5]. <p> Goran Andersson's game of Domineering <ref> [BCG82, p. 115] </ref> (a.k.a. Dominoes [Con76, p. 74] or Cross-Cram [Gar74]) is played on any subset of squares of a graph paper between two players who we'll call Left and Right. A Left move consists of placing a domino vertically, removing two adjacent squares. Right places dominoes horizontally. <p> The common element is that as either game is played, the game can (and often does) get separated into regions which behave (virtually) independently. A player can use a move to play in any of the regions without affecting the others. Winning Ways <ref> [BCG82] </ref> is chalk full of entertaining games, most of which were invented by the authors, which are partially or completely analyzed. 4 What are impartial games? Impartial games are a special class of games in which the roles of the players (i.e., which moves they are permitted to make) are indistinguishable. <p> The theory of impartial games under normal play is a quickest to learn, and the student may soon be enticed into thinking about the (much more challenging) misere games. If you wish to learn the full theory, there are several options open to you. Winning Ways <ref> [BCG82] </ref> is by far the most entertaining. This is a truly remarkable book with more enjoyable examples of games than you'll be able to make time time to learn. On Numbers and Games is more mathematically technical that Winning Ways, and is another excellent resource.

Reference-contexts: It has provided insight into many mathematical games (including games on graphs, Nim variants and Sprouts) as well as some more popular games (most notably, Dots & Boxes). More recently, Conway's theory has been applied to Go, a game popular throughout the world. <ref> [BW94a, Ch. 5] </ref>. Combinatorial game theory is concerned with games of complete information where players take turns (e.g., chess). Complexity arises from the huge game tree of a typical game. <p> Winning Ways [BCG82] is by far the most entertaining. This is a truly remarkable book with more enjoyable examples of games than you'll be able to make time time to learn. On Numbers and Games is more mathematically technical that Winning Ways, and is another excellent resource. Mathematical Go <ref> [BW94a] </ref> [BW94b] is the most current book available. It too covers the basic combinatorial game theory, but with an eye toward the game Go. This is the most active current area of research in combinatorial game theory, which has proved to be extremely successful for late-stage Go endgame problems.

Reference-contexts: A toolkit, written in C by the author, is another valuable tool in learning the theory. It implements most of operations in combinatorial game theory, and saves the researcher from tedious pencil and paper calculations. It's available for free by e-mail <ref> [Wol] </ref>. 6 How to find a research pro ject. The best way to embark on research in combinatorial game theory is to invent a fun game and analyze it. The game should decompose into sums as the game is played, so as to make the theory most applicable. <p> To analyze the game, you can either use paper and pencil techniques, or you can write a computer program to analyze a large number of positions and try to come up with theorems characterizing the results.
