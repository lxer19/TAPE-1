Abstract: This paper presents a scalable electro-optical interconnection network architecture which is suitable for tightly coupled multiprocessors. The architecture is called a Partitioned Optical Passive Star (POPS). It is a type of multiple passive star topology in which only constant and symmetric coupler fanouts are used and in which exactly one coupler is traversed on any path through the network. Control is based on the state sequence routing paradigm which multiplexes the network between a small set of control states and defines a control operation to be a transformation of those states. These networks have highly scalable characteristics for optical power budget, resource count, and message latency. Optical power is uniformly distributed and the size of the system is not hard limited by the power budget. Resource complexity grows with asymptotic complexity O(n) for the couplers, O(nn) for transceivers, and O(n log(n)) for control. In this paper, we present a static analysis and a simulation of dynamic performance which demonstrates the ability of a POPS design to support 1024 nodes using current device and coupler technology. Optical power constraints can limit the size of a system to the number of receiver sites that can be illuminated by a single transmitter. Often these receivers must be illuminated in unpredictable patterns and in the presence of significant losses in the transmission medium. Control efficiency is a measure of the amount of data transferred per control operation. Since in an electro-optic network the bandwidth of the electronic control circuits is typically limited, control bandwidth can become a bottleneck unless each increase in optical bandwidth is accompanied by a corresponding increase in control efficiency. In this paper, we present an architecture which is a synthesis of a topological solution to the resource complexity and power distribution problems, and a control paradigm which exploits locality characteristics in the message traffic to amortize control overhead over multiple messages. The topology is based on a multiple passive star organization which we call a Partitioned Optical Passive Star or POPS network. The control solution is based on the state sequence routing paradigm which was originally proposed by the authors in [CLMQ,CLMQ93]. Our presentation is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the background and previous research which motivates this effort. Section 3 introduces the POPS network topology, and Section 4 describes state sequence routing. Section 5 characterizes network performance by a static analysis of the service time for random message sets. Section 6 outlines the distributed implementation of state sequence routing, and Section 7 presents simulation data on dynamic performance. Section 8 outlines our conclusions and directions for future research.

Reference-contexts: This technology is currently capable of wavelength separations on the order of 1 nm yielding a total on the order of 100 slots given a typical fiber transmission window with constraints on the total power of all wavelengths <ref> [Bra90] </ref>. In addition, it is necessary to use rapidly tunable laser sources, rapidly tunable filter receivers, or both, to obtain sufficient interconnectivity and throughput. Only if both tunable receivers and tunable transmitters are used is it possible to use a number of wavelengths less than the number of interconnected nodes.

In considering the combined issues of topology and control, our investigation has specifically focused on the application of optical technology which can be implemented currently or in the near term. Our designs are constrained by the following parameters.

Reference-contexts: This requires high speed signal processing be performed at both the transmitting and receiving nodes in order to obtain usable data rates. Several implementations using optical processing have been proposed <ref> [CM92, HS92] </ref>. In addition, a set of orthogonal codes is required to uniquely address each receiver node.

Reference-contexts: These conicts can be resolved with varying success using any of several distributed control protocols [Meh90]. However, the need to use a control channel may place a limit on the network capacity imposed by the bandwidth of the control channel <ref> [Dow91] </ref>. CDM requires data bits be encoded with respect to the address of the receiver using a sequence of bits at a much higher rate than the data bit rate [PSS86, SWH90].

Reference-contexts: For example, using a coupler fanout of 64, a 1024 node system would have 16 groups, 16 transmitter and receiver channels per node and 256 couplers. Further, if one were to adopt integrated optical [OOOK92] or free space coupling <ref> [Hin89] </ref> in lieu of fused fiber, even higher fanouts and larger scale systems are possible. This domain is potentially very interesting for two reasons. First, as optical bandwidths continue to increase more rapidly than the data bandwidth per processor, high fanout coupling is 4 more desirable.

Reference-contexts: The essential point is that the control unit needs only to respond to the changes in the traffic and is no longer required to respond to individual messages. Since communication patterns in a multiprocessor environment tend to exhibit locality characteristics <ref> [Joh92] </ref>, the rate at which changes occur in the traffic is significantly lower than the message generation rate. Thus, our stated goal of decou-pling the control bandwidth from the throughput is achieved. There are several methods of implementing dynamic sequence transformation.

Reference-contexts: Under this rule, the total couplers increase linearly in proportion to n, and the number of transmitter/receiver channels increase proportionately to nn. Given these characteristics and current technological limits on coupler fanout <ref> [Opt93] </ref>, it is currently feasible to construct POPS networks on the order of a few thousands of processors. For example, using a coupler fanout of 64, a 1024 node system would have 16 groups, 16 transmitter and receiver channels per node and 256 couplers.

Reference-contexts: Optimally, the algorithm should choose the entity which will be used at the most distant future time. Since future behavior cannot be precisely predicted, an optimal algorithm cannot be devised. However, the literature on operating systems contains numerous algorithms of varying complexity for selecting a candidate for replacement <ref> [SPG91] </ref>. A central focus of our current research is the application of these algorithms to state sequence routing. Although the replacement algorithm is important, the latency of any message, whether in a fault state or not, is also tied to the choice of sequence length.

Unfortunately, the latencies inherent in a fully time multiplexed implementation, as well as for most other static embeddings, is prohibitive.
