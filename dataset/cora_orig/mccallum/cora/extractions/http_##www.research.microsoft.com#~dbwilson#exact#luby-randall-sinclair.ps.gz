Title: Markov Chain Algorithms for Planar Lattice Structures (Extended Abstract)  
Author: Michael Luby Dana Randall Alistair Sinclair 
Abstract: Consider the following Markov chain, whose states are all domino tilings of a 2n fi 2n chessboard: starting from some arbitrary tiling, pick a 2 fi 2 window uniformly at random. If the four squares appearing in this window are covered by two parallel dominoes, rotate the dominoes in place. Repeat many times. This process is used in practice to generate a random tiling, and is a key tool in the study of the combinatorics of tilings and the behavior of dimer systems in statistical physics. Analogous Markov chains are used to randomly generate other structures on various two-dimensional lattices. This paper presents techniques which prove for the first time that, in many interesting cases, a small number of random moves suffice to obtain a uniform distribution.

Reference-contexts: Notice that we may implement a move of M loz as follows. Given a routing R, choose an internal point p on one of the paths in R , and a number r 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> uniformly at random. Assume first that r 1=2 . If p is a valley then it is the bottom of a unique tower of height h; in this case, if r 1=2h rotate the tower. <p> We define a coupling as follows. Consider two copies of the Markov chain, whose states are the paths P 1 and P 2 , each containing N internal points. Then in one move we choose (i; r) 2 u f1; : : : ; N g fi <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and simultaneously move the i th points of each of P 1 and P 2 as specified by the random number r . It should be clear that this is a valid coupling. <p> The coupling we use is the following obvious generalization of our earlier one. Given a pair of routings, choose the same random point p on both routings, say the ith point of the j th path, and the same random bit r 2 u <ref> [0; 1] </ref> . Then update each routing by rotating at point p with the appropriate probability as determined by the random number r . As in the single-path case, we can argue that it is sufficient to bound the expected coupling time for 6 a pair of extremal routings. <p> The transition probabilities P ( ; ) of M dom are: 8 : tower of height h; 1 R6=R 1 To implement one step of this Markov chain, starting at a routing R, choose (e; r) 2 u R fi <ref> [0; 1] </ref> . First suppose r 1=2 . If the edge e is a diagonal directed up and to the right, check to see if there is a tower starting at e and extending in the north-west direction. <p> To implement one step of M eul , starting at a routing R, choose (p; r) 2 u R fi <ref> [0; 1] </ref> . If r 1=2 , check to see whether p is the lower-right point of a vertical or horizontal tower (of height h), and rotate the tower if r &lt; 1=2h and this yields a legal routing.

Reference-contexts: The following result relating the mixing time to the coupling time is standard (see, e.g., <ref> [2] </ref>): Theorem 3 t (*) 6T (1 + ln * 1 ) . Next, we introduce some machinery that will help us to bound the coupling time.

Reference-contexts: This is the six-point model in statistical mechanics, also known as the "ice model." The correspondence between Eulerian orientations and a suitable class of routings is well known in the physics community (see, e.g., <ref> [3] </ref>), and is sketched in figure 4. The sources and sinks in this case are defined by the boundary conditions, as shown. <p> An alternative unifying framework for these problems is provided by height functions, which map two-dimensional structures to three-dimensional surfaces. The correspondence between tilings and height functions is a beautiful result of Thurston, Con-way and Lagarias [4, 17] and was previously known for Eulerian orientations (see, e.g., <ref> [3] </ref>). Lattice rout-ings, which we have derived directly from the underlying combinatorial structures, can also be interpreted as the level sets of appropriate height functions.

Reference-contexts: This was the reason we implemented the Markov chain in this fashion in Section 3.1. We now need to bound the expected time it takes the coupled process to cause any two initial routings to agree. To simplify the problem, we use an observation due to Propp and Wilson <ref> [15] </ref>: if the state space of a Markov chain forms a distributive lattice, and the coupling preserves the partial order, then the coupling time is bounded above by the expected time for coupling to occur when the initial states are the largest and smallest elements of the lattice. <p> This can be improved by more refined arguments, which we defer to the full paper. (b) In practice, we can run an experiment to bound the coupling time using stopping rules as in <ref> [15] </ref>. We can run the coupled process starting with the two extremal elements in the set of routings to bound the coupling time T .
