Reference-contexts: Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) Gas Sensors The resistance of MOS gas sensors <ref> [1] </ref> is known empirically to have a power law dependence on oxygen concentration directly and on combustible (reducing) gas concentration inversely.

Reference-contexts: Atmospheric oxygen captures free electrons or depletes free metal, increasing the electrical resistance. Reducing gases deplete oxygen or restore the free metal, reducing electrical resistance. Thus resistance increases with oxygen partial pressure and decreases with reducing gas partial pressure. A simple generic equilibrium picture <ref> [4] </ref> is adequate to transform [O ] and [X] concentrations 2 atm o outside the sensor and [e ] electron density inside the sensor under vacuum conditions into [O ], vac 2 -[X], and [e ] inside the sensor with the atmosphere admitted.

Reference-contexts: Thus taste is a more like a classification than a measurement. Whether smell is more like a classification or more like a measurement turns out to be unresolved. Amoore <ref> [5] </ref> correlated elaborate odor classification trials by human subjects with stereochemical data.

Reference-contexts: Thus a single type of intricately shaped molecule might evoke an olfactory symphony, whereas a mixture of chemically different but more-or-less identically shaped molecules might stimulate but a single note. On the other hand Gesteland <ref> [6] </ref>, with the Lettvin and Pitts of frog's-eye fame [7], studied the frog's olfactory epithelium and concluded that every cell was sensitive (with either an excitatory or inhibitory effect), in varying proportion from cell to cell, to a large subset if not all the chemicals that the frog could smell: "... <p> their conclusions drawn from direct measurements on cells stimulated by odors and Amoore's conclusions drawn from human perception experiments is so stark as apparently to leave the door open for all manner of speculation, which Lettvin and Gesteland [8] do unabashedly in a companion paper to Gesteland, Lettvin, and Pitts <ref> [6] </ref>. Whatever lack of resolution there is about the olfactory transducers' discriminatory abilities by chemical selectivity (in contrast to computational discrimination), the structure of the wiring diagram of nerve fibers connecting the olfactory sensor layer with the olfactory cognition region of the brain is noncontroversial.

Reference-contexts: Axons from the mitral cells connect the olfactory bulb to the cognitive areas of the brain. In short, the olfactory apparatus looks a lot like a three-layered perceptron <ref> [9, 10] </ref> with a layer of sensory units corresponding to the cells of the olfactory patch at the top of the nasal cavity, a layer of associative units corresponding to the mitral cells of the olfactory bulb on the other side of the cribriform plate, and 2 a layer of response <p> The assembly is installed in an air-tight metal test chamber supplied with a constant flow of either pure synthetic air or dilute sample vapor in synthetic air.

The correspondence between the physiology of the olfactory machinery and the rubric of artificial neural network models of sensory perception is close, but the match to simple models, e.g., layer-to-adjacent-layer connections with a few to a few tens of connections per unit, is arguable.
