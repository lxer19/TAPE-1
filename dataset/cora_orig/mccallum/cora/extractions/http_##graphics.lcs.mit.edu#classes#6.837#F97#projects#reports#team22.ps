Abstract: This project deals with the simulation of multibody systems in which individual bodies undergo motion with large displacements and rotations, as well as collisions among the simulated bodies. Examples of such systems are colliding bodies or particles, flow of granular materials, which can be found almost everywhere in our physical or technological world, granular soils and rock masses in geomechanics, physically based animations using computer graphics, and in general any system that involves multiple bodies that may come in contact during motion. The objective of the project is to develop a computational tool that allows the simulation of such systems for both engineering purposes, providing visualization of the simulation results using computer graphics, and for generating more realistic physically-based animations. This project focuses on simulation of systems with many bodies interacting through contacts, which require a fast contact detection algorithm. A general algorithm that reduces the computational cost to O(n.lgn), where n is the number of objects, using bounding boxes and spatial sorting has been developed and implemented. Object-oriented programming has been used to allow the easy extension of the tool. Within the time limits of the project we have considered only simple primitives (spheres). However, our program can be easily extended to handle bodies of any shape by providing the appropriate functions for contact detection and calculation of contact forces.
