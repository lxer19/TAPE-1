Abstract: In this paper, a novel dynamic frequency based SIMD linear array processor (DFLAP) for image processing applications is proposed. The operating clock frequency of the processor is varied dynamically between 400MHz and 50MHz based on the operation performed in order to enhance the processor throughput. An efficient implementation for the dynamic clocking unit (DCU) which enables dynamic switching of clock frequencies is presented. Each processing element in the linear array contains an 8-bit arithmetic/logic unit, an 8fi8 single-cycle multiplier, a shifter, a bidirectional neighbor communication unit, a 32fi8 dual port SRAM, and a DCU. The architecture was designed and implemented using CADENCE design tools. Several low-level image processing tasks have been mapped onto the architecture to demonstrate the effectiveness of the dynamic frequency based architecture.

Reference-contexts: Each instruction consists of several microinstructions and each microinstruction requires several clock cycles. The advances in VLSI design has led to the design of various special purpose hardware such as <ref> [1] </ref>, which are suitable for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a linear array processor architecture, DFLAP, based on an array of 8-bit processing elements (PE) for image processing applications. <p> CLOCK FUNCTION ENABLE FLAGS ADDER SHIFTER SRAM LOGIC MULTIPLIER NEIGHBOR COMMUNI CATION 400 MHz 400 MHz200 MHz 200 MHz 50 MHz100 MHz CLK3 CLK4CLK2CLK1 Pass Logic Two (T-FF) Pass Logic Divide by Two Two Divide by Pass Logic Divide by Encoder Enable Encoder Instruction MUX I/P Clock E [2] E <ref> [1] </ref> E [0] S [1:0] Instruction Word Clock O/P only logic operations while others only additions and certain others multiplication and division. The operating frequency of the PE is controlled by the DCU residing within each PE. The DCU is a finite state machine which senses the operation being performed. <p> The 8-bit 10 PE based DFLAP has a throughput density of 6.55 E7 multiplications/second/chip compared to the 10.8 E6 multiplications/second/chip of the 4-bit PE based SIBA <ref> [1] </ref> and 4.82 E5 multiplications/second/chip of the 1-bit PE based NCR GAPP [2]. 5. CONCLUSIONS We have presented and designed a novel linear array processor based on dynamic clocking.

Reference-contexts: The performance comparison of DFLAP (DF) with that of an uni-frequency (SF) processor for the same architecture shows a speed up ranging from 1.79 to 3 for the various algorithms. DFLAP also performs better or comparable to other architectures. The Warp machine <ref> [3] </ref> with 10 Warp cells is a programmable systolic architecture designed and built for image processing applications. Its performance was compared with DFLAP for various image processing algorithms.The Sobel Edge detection operation takes 206ms on warp and .088ms on DFLAP when executed on 512fi512 8-bit images.

Reference-contexts: Many processors like Pentium use a clock dividing strategy to operate the different units at different speeds. In the clock divider strategy, various units receive a separate clock operating at a different frequency but in dynamic frequency clocking, the same clock switches frequencies dynamically. Reconfigurable architectures like HARP <ref> [5] </ref> have a frequency synthesizer which permits the desired clock rate based on the circuit mapped. In dynamic frequency clocking, we switch frequencies based on the units being used.
