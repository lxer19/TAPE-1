Note: 6.837 FINAL PROJECT: 3D Lightcycles  
Abstract: We have created an interactive three dimensional game for two players which we believe to be visually and intuitively appealing but still challenging. The plot of the game is based on the "Lightcycle" game from the movie "TRON", in which players maneuver in right angles on a finite field, leaving a continuous wall as a trail behind them. A player loses when he or she crashes into a wall left by either player or traverses the edge of the field.
