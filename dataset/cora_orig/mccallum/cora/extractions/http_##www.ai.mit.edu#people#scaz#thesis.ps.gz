Reference-contexts: The abstraction of visual processing as a uni-directional pipeline is computation-ally and conceptually simple, but removes a great deal of functionality from our model. Students in introductory neuroscience classes (and often computer vision sur 19 perceived as either the letter "A" or the letter "H". From <ref> [And90, p. 76] </ref>. vey courses) are presented with detailed information of how information is passed from the simple receptive fields of retinal cells to the lateral geniculate nucleus and then to cortical areas V1 and V2, but very little is said about the equal number of projections that travel in the <p> Four different sources of contour information will be presented in this section: illusory contours from Gestalt effects, contours from expectations or prior knowledge, contours from filling-in effects, and contours from other sensory information. 39 continuation, and (d) closure and good form. Adapted from <ref> [And90, p. 67] </ref>. 3.3.1 Gestalt-based Contours: Illusory Contours Figures like the Kanizsa square (Figure 3-1) have been of great interest to psychologists because of the perceptual illusions that they create. These effects have been called "illusory contours," "subjective contours," "imaginary figures," and a host of similar names.

Reference-contexts: Contours are vital for tasks involving discrimination of figure/ground relationships, such as object discrimination [BW93], robot navigation [Hor93], and manipulation [HI84]. Contours can also be used to track objects [KWT87], or to find motion in a scene <ref> [AP93] </ref>. Higher level cognitive tasks, such as trying to solve a maze, reproducing a pen-and-ink drawing of an object, or determining where a wire on a circuit board leads, will also be much simpler to construct with a contour detection subroutine.

Reference-contexts: Instead of simply averaging local pixels to downsize the image, local groups are weighted by a Laplacian function before begin summed. As an example, a Gaussian is a specialized type of Laplacian function.

This opponency image is the absolute value of the difference in the filtered images. pattern in Figure 6-4 was processed by two filters oriented at +45 degrees and 45 degrees from vertical.

Reference-contexts: A series of three active vision heads were built at the MIT Artificial Intelligence lab for various research into active vision. The three-heads project was an outgrowth of the Cog project, which aims at building an upper-torso humanoid robot <ref> [BS93] </ref>. The robots were designed with assistance from Mike Wessler and Sajit Rao, and were constructed with the assistance of two undergraduate students: Matt Scheuring, who constructed the aluminum support frame, and Diego Syrowicz, who populated many of the circuit boards.

Reference-contexts: The third design goal for Charlotte's visual system was to allow for moving cameras. The advantages and complexities introduced with an active vision system have been studied by many different researchers (for a review, see <ref> [BY92] </ref>). Moving cameras create many problems for image processing through blurring of images and sampling problems. However, moving cameras also allow for a greater range of life-like behavior and simplify some computational issues. For example, suppose that you are interested in identifying faces.

Reference-contexts: A great deal of effort has been expended on finding filters that locate edges in all directions while filtering out the desired amount of noise. Perhaps the best known of these studies was the thesis of John Canny <ref> [Can83] </ref>. Canny defined three criteria that a luminance edge detector should capture: First, that the detector have a low error probability. Second, that the points marked as edges should be as close as possible to the true edge.
