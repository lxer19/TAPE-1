Abstract: A unified analysis of several polar quantization schemes is developed by focusing on their point densities and inertial profiles and using Bennett's integral to express the mean-squared error. The subsequent analysis is straightforward and leads to new insights into the relationship between polar quantization and Cartesian quantization. With this approach, unrestricted polar quantization, which is arguably the best method, may be optimized essentially by inspection. As another example, a new polar quantization method, called power law polar, is analyzed and optimized. Polar quantization with a uniform magnitude quantizer is also analyzed and optimized, using recent high-resolution results on the optimal step size and support of uniform scalar quantization for sources with unbounded support. It is shown that the optimal rate allocation gives increasingly more rate to the magnitude as total rate increases, compared to nonuniform polar, where the difference between optimal magnitude and phase rates is asymptotically a constant.

Reference-contexts: However, the analysis in [15] assumed a fixed support region for the magnitude quantizer, when in fact for true optimality the support needs to increase with rate. In this paper, we optimize restricted uniform PQ asymptotically by using a recent result from Hui and Neuhoff <ref> [19] </ref> on the support of uniform scalar quantization to choose the optimal support of the magnitude quantizer. We then find the optimal rate allocation between magnitude and phase and the resulting mean-squared error. <p> We then find the optimal rate allocation between magnitude and phase and the resulting mean-squared error.

Gaussian Sources Consider an IID Gaussian source, so that the magnitude is Rayleigh.

Their results are summarized in the following lemma. <p> As shown in Figure 5, our expression for SNR slightly overestimates Pearlman's results. This is because our analytic formula ignores overload distortion. We note that the above analysis can be repeated for other magnitude distributions. We also note that the more accurate expressions in <ref> [19] </ref> for the support and distortion of optimal uniform scalar quantizers could be used to improve the approximations given here. <p> Finally, Figure 6 compares the SNR of optimized restricted uniform PQ to that of restricted nonuniform PQ and Cartesian product uniform scalar quantization (USQ), as optimized in <ref> [19] </ref>. We see that the SNRs of all three methods increase asymptotically as 6 dB/bit. However the difference in SNR between restricted nonuniform and restricted uniform tends to infinity as rate increases.
