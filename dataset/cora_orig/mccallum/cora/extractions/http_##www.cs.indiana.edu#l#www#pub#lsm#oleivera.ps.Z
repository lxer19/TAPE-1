Abstract: Yet, when only the significantly associated bigrams were considered, DetLo's profiles were found to vary much more than DetHi's profiles, with DetLo exhibiting a minor negative correlation, and DetHi's profiles being minorly significantly correlated. The finding that correlations were stronger when all the bigrams were taken into account is interesting in that it suggests that the `bread and butter' of the proofs are similar, differences arising from those bigrams that occur centrally in the profiles. This may suggest that DetHi subjects maintain a high level of structure in all their proofs, yet are flexible about this structure in rule use. In this case, the hypothesis of strategy flexibility carries over to the groups. This property of structure in the proofs is another feature that distinguishes these two groups. Typically, learning style studies that have investigated the visualiser-verbaliser distinction use psychometric instruments as the basis for classifying subjects. For example, the paper-folding test has been used by Mayer and Sims (1994) in a recent study of learning from computer-generated animation; and by Campagnoni and Ehrlich (1989) in a study of individual differences in hypertext navigation. However, it is currently unclear how strongly internal behaviour (as measured by paper-and-pencil psychometric tests) is related to external reasoning performance. Therefore, in the current study, subjects were classified according to their performance on diagrammatic reasoning items. &gt;> We didn't do psychometric tests, so can't give a direct answer. However, there are several interesting clues in the data. p1) You might think it's just visualiser-verbaliser. We think not, because: X (multimodal hypothesis). &lt;<In summary, we find most support for the multimodal hypothesis: the DetHi group seem to be more able to translate information between the modalities, using abstract graphical representations of the logical situations to construct incrementally their proof. DetLo choose to move all relevant information to the graphical window initially, whereas DetHi subjects assume a more dynamic relationship between the modalities.&gt;> 2) In fact, this suggests that it's serial-holist. Reasons to think it. More generally, what we're looking at is a behavioural skill, retlated to "appropriate levels of translation". So there you go.

Reference-contexts: One of the main features of the resulting explanatory structure from our method is a hypertext-like structure, in which chunks of sensible information are provided to users and expanded on demand. This is an important attemp at pragmatic adequacy <ref> [Leech'83] </ref> that we do; all transformations upon ND proofs are so done that the remaining logical formulas contain information that users can bind together in an inferential process that is natural to them.

Reference-contexts: In general, the largest the proof piece the better the breaking point, as long as the resulting proof retains a manageable amount of information to be presented. The number of predicates and terms making up the proof should be within the acceptable limits (around 7, cf. <ref> [Miller'56] </ref>), whenever possible. A structural criteria to identify desirable breaking points is to look at the terms that appear in the proof conclusion.

Reference-contexts: Recent results include a method for interpreting the results of the theorem prover in the case of partial or negative answers, with an analysis of the impact of the use of logical connectives in the context of cooperative interaction (cf. <ref> [Oliveira et al.'98] </ref>). We observe that the exact meaning of the logical connectives has to be taken into account when generating natural language answers from formal logical systems in order to avoid misleading the user.
