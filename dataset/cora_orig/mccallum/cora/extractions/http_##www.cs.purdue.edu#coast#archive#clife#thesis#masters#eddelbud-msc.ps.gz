Reference-contexts: Thereafter, we will consider the methods used for index fund construction | first as described by Liesching and Manchanda (1990), second as described by Meade and Salkin (1989). Finally, we will discuss fund maintenance issues raised by Meade and Salkin (1990). 5.2 Introducing Indexation <ref> (Bishop 1990b) </ref> Bishop estimates that in the US between 20% - 25% of all pension fund assets are managed on an index basis; Markowitz (1990) gives a 250 billion $ estimate for the indexation volume worldwide.

Reference-contexts: A summary will conclude the chapter. 4.2 Decision under Uncertainty and Portfolio Analysis If we want to understand how asset prices are fixed on financial markets, we have to see how economic agents rank different assets promising different future payments. We thus consider the decision making among uncertain alternatives <ref> (Kreps 1990, Goppl 1990) </ref>. The theory of decision under uncertainty is based on five axioms. We consider the set X of outcomes for assets, i.e. payments that the economic agent will receive at the end of the period. We write ~x, ~y and ~z for elements of X . <p> and Manchanda (1990) predicted tracking error of approximately 0.5%, or lower." One notes immediately that "the bigger, the better" holds another time, but that is hardly surprising as strategies called "naive diversification" (by a large number of stocks to minimize systematic risk; see chapter 4) are well known in Finance <ref> (Goppl 1990) </ref>. We have at our disposal a Deutsche Bank internal memorandum from 1990 that sums up on three pages indexation methods (these arguments are nearly identical to the ones by Liesching and Manchanda (1990) that we discussed) as well as results already achieved by financial firms: 7.4.

Reference-contexts: As a result, with 250 to 300 stocks a tracking error of under 0.5% can be obtained for the UK. The main benefit of optimised sampling 5.4. MORE ON INDEX FUND CONSTRUCTION <ref> (MEADE AND SALKIN 1989) </ref> 49 is this good level of tracking accuracy as well as the flexibility obtained by using the factor models. This means that this method is the most cost efficient way of creating index funds. <p> Liesching and Manchanda (1990) discuss then trading methods as cross-trades or basket-trades to reduce costs further; we will not discuss this at this study focuses on the stock selection problem. 5.4 More on Index Fund Construction <ref> (Meade and Salkin 1989) </ref> Meade and Salkin (1989) also address the selection procedures for the construction of index funds. <p> MORE ON INDEX FUND CONSTRUCTION <ref> (MEADE AND SALKIN 1989) </ref> 51 forecasting, i.e. that the underlying statistical relationships that are being modeled by the selection of the index fund will persist." Their starting point are two desirable `properties' that a fund might possess: * stratification | the fund should have a proportion invested in each industrial sector <p> This latter can be written as minimize V (p t;L ) subject to E (p t;L ) = E (d t;L ) ; 5.4. MORE ON INDEX FUND CONSTRUCTION <ref> (MEADE AND SALKIN 1989) </ref> 53 this class of problems is usually solved by quadratic programming techniques. On the other hand, the index-fund selection requires that the risk and return of the fund matches that of the index as closely as possible over any investment horizon.

Reference-contexts: Concluding, Meade and Salkin (1989) summarize that the imposition of the constraint led to a deterioration in performance; straight optimisation emerged as the best performing method. 5.5 Maintaining Index Funds <ref> (Meade and Salkin 1990) </ref> In their sequel, Meade and Salkin (1990) start by giving a new definition for the tracking error as a root-mean-square error measure of the difference in returns between the portfolio and the index: T E = u t t=1 T where, at time t, the return on <p> That is i;t = i;t1 + " i;t where cov (" i;t ; " i+l;t+k ) = 0 ; for l or k 6= 0 and 5.5.

First, geometric indices always underperform arithmetic indices.
