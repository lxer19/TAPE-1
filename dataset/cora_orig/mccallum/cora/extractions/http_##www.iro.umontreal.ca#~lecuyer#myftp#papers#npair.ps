Title: STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION CLOSE-POINT SPATIAL TESTS AND THEIR APPLICATION TO RANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS  
Author: PIERRE L'ECUYER, JEAN-FRANCOIS CORDEAU, and RICHARD SIMARD 
Affiliation: Statement  
Abstract: Ideally, a random number generator used for a given simulation problem should pass statistical tests closely related to that problem. But tailoring special tests for each problem is impractical. General purpose generators must then be submitted to a wide range of varied statistical tests, sensitive to different types of defects in the generator. In this article, we study statistical tests based on nearest-neighbor distances between the points formed by vectors of uniform random numbers. Such tests are relevant and necessary, because Monte Carlo simulation is often used to estimate the (complicated) distribution of certain statistics related to nearest-neighbor distances. The contribution of this paper is to provide an empirical study of these spatial tests from three viewpoints. Firstly, the distributions of most of these test statistics are known only asymptotically, and we evaluate, by simulation, the approximation error of the exact distribution by its asymptotic counterpart. Secondly, we investigate practical implementation issues for the tests. Thirdly, we study how certain classes of commonly used random number generators behave with respect to these tests. Linear congruential generators fail spectacularly when the sample size gets close to the square root of the period length. Since a sample size of 2 16 points is small and easy to handle for today's computers, one should conclude that linear congruential generators with period length around 2 32 , which are still commonly used, are inappropriate.

Reference-contexts: One rejects H 0 if the p-value ffi 0 = 1 F N (A 2 N ) is deemed to small. This setup fits the paradigm of the two-level tests that are commonly used in RNG testing <ref> (Fishman 1996, Knuth 1981) </ref>. 1.5 The nearest-pair test As an interesting special case, take m = 1; that is, compute only the distance between the nearest pair of points, and repeat this N times, independently.

Reference-contexts: Other tests commonly applied to RNGs, such as the serial test and the collison test <ref> (Knuth 1981) </ref>, can also detect spatial clustering in the unit hypercube. However, they have less power than the specially designed tests studied here against alternatives that correspond to regular structures of commonly used generators. Consider for example the following standard serial test . <p> But generators with similar bad properties have been proposed and used in the past. For example, G5 in our list (RANDU) has a much worse structure in 3 dimensions than in 2 dimensions <ref> (Knuth 1981) </ref>. Also, the add-with-carry, subtract-with-borrow, and additive lagged-Fibonacci generators behave very similarly to the MRG of order 5 in our last example (L'Ecuyer 1994, L'Ecuyer 1997). 26 5 Conclusion We have examined and compared different variants of close-pair tests to detect the regularities of linear congruential generators.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, if the lattice structure of the LCG is good, there is a large lower bound on D fl n , independent of n <ref> (Ripley 1987, page 26) </ref>. Therefore, for large n, the nearest-pair distance will be larger than expected. <p> Table XII gives the value of fl that we obtained for certain tests, with p = 1 and k = 2. To reject decisively, the NP test with N = 1 <ref> (which is the test discussed by Ripley 1987) </ref> needs n 8 p M , whereas the 32-NP test with N = 1 needs n p M . With N = 32, the NP-S and NP-PR tests need a sample size approximately 8 times smaller than the NP test.

Reference-contexts: In most cases, the distribution of the relevant statistic under the null hypothesis is known asymptotically, as the number of sample points increases to infinity. Otherwise, this distribution is often estimated by Monte Carlo simulation <ref> (Ripley 1988, Schilling 1983a) </ref>. In this paper, we study different aspects of such goodness-of-fit tests from an empirical perspective. Firstly, we introduce new test variants.

Reference-contexts: To make the effect of clustering more easily detectable by A 2 N , we consider two types of transformations on the observations: The spacings and the power ratio. Both are well-known in statistics <ref> (e.g., Stephens 1986) </ref>, but their use in conjunction with the NP test seems new. Consider again U (1) ; : : : ; U (N) , the N replicates of W fl n;1 sorted by increasing order. <p> When several observations are already concentrated near zero or one, further iterations of the spacings do not help. The other transformation that we consider is the power ratio <ref> (see Stephens 1986) </ref>: U 0 Under ~ H 0 , these U 0 i form a new sample of i.i.d. U (0; 1). If the U (i) are clustered, this will produce several U 0 i close to one.
