Reference-contexts: We discuss the applications of subresul-tants in parallel greatest common divisor (gcd) algorithms and in computing the extended Euclidean scheme. These algorithms have played a major role in the recent development of parallel methods in real geometry. For example, the algorithm of Ben-Or, Kozen and Reif <ref> [1] </ref>, which gives an efficient parallel decision procedure for questions in the theory of real closed fields, employs a variety of parallel resultant-based techniques; the extension and corrected analysis by Renegar [21] makes essential use of multivariate resultants, presented in x20.1.1 below.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, if deg ` &lt; deg f + deg g, then ( ` f ; ` g ) 2 ker ', thus is singular. The resultant of two univariate polynomials can be computed in NC using Csanky's algorithm [10] in characteristic 0 or Berkowitz' <ref> [2] </ref> or Chistov's [9] algorithm in arbitrary characteristic; see [25]. DEFINITION Consider the coefficients of f and g as indeterminates a = a deg f ; : : : ; a 0 , b = b deg g ; : : : ; b 0 . <p> However, we can apply Algorithm 20.2 to the monic associate of g, then adjust q afterward by dividing by the leading coefficient of g. All operations can be implemented in NC . The principal minors of deg g1 can be computed without division using Berkowitz' <ref> [2] </ref> or Chistov's [9] algorithm. 20.2 Univariate Resultants 21 20.2.4 A Resultant System for Several Univariate Polynomials The constructions of x20.1.1 and x20.1.1 can be modified to yield NC algorithms for testing whether a set of univariate polynomials has a common root and for computing their gcd. <p> Form the Sylvester matrix of f and f n . The entries are polynomials in k [y] of degree at most n 1. 20.2 Univariate Resultants 23 3. Calculate the resultant det of f and f n using Berkowitz' <ref> [2] </ref> or Chistov's [9] algorithm. This is a polynomial in k [y] of degree at most (n 1) deg f n . 4. Check whether det vanishes identically. By Theorem 20.10, this occurs iff f 0 ; : : :; f n have a common root. <p> The coefficients of r (a; y) thus form a resultant system for f 0 ; : : : ; f n . It is possible to work in the polynomial ring k [x; y; a] explicitly and compute the symbolic resultant r (a; y) in NC using Berkowitz' <ref> [2] </ref> or Chistov's [9] algorithm. These algorithms produce a polylog-depth, polynomial-size circuit C for r (a; y) over +, , constants, and inputs a and y. <p> Form the subresultant matrices d of f and f n . The entries of d are polynomials in y of degree at most n 1. 3. Compute the subresultants over k (y)[x] using Berkowitz' <ref> [2] </ref> or Chistov's [9] algorithm. The d th subresultant det d is a polynomial in y of degree at most (n 1) (deg f n d). 4. Let d be the smallest number such that det d does not vanish identically. <p> The determinant, for example, is defined and computed using only ring operations; so we can either compute det A as a polynomial in k [c] and then specialize the variables c to the coefficients of the f i 's, or specialize the coefficients and then compute the determinant <ref> [2] </ref>. In both cases the result will be the same. The only other operation required in the construction is the division of these determinants. Unfortunately this operation does not commute with specialization.

Reference-contexts: In the computation of the multivariate resultant to be presented in x20.1.1, it will be essential to have a polynomial division algorithm for monic g that does not use any divisions in k, but only the ring operations and +. Here we give a resultant-style algorithm used by Canny <ref> [6] </ref> that alleviates these problems. The algorithm is based on the following theorem. THEOREM 20.9 Let m = deg f deg g + 2, the dimension of deg g1 . <p> Note that all of the above calculations that require 34 Chapter 20. Parallel Resultant Computation only ring operations commute with substitution for the indeterminates <ref> [6, Ch. 3] </ref>, since substitution determines a ring homomorphism. <p> Parallel Resultant Computation where e = n d Q n i=0 d i , and compute the division a=b using Algorithm 20.2. Since b is monic, only the ring operations are needed. This gives the desired resultant. See also <ref> [6, x3.1.3] </ref> for another method of computing these classical re sultants. <p> Its use has 20.3 Multivariate Resultants 37 been revived by computational applications, as in the zero-finding algorithm of Lazard [15], the approximation algorithm of Renegar [19], and the work of Canny <ref> [6] </ref> in theoretical robotics and of Renegar [20, 21] in real algebraic geometry. Behind the construction of u-resultants lies the following idea.
Reference: [7] <author> J. Canny. </author> <title> Generalized characteristic polynomials. </title> <type> Preprint, </type> <year> 1988. </year>
Reference-contexts: This observation was used to produce an efficient algebraic algorithm for computing the resultant of n polynomials in n variables directly from their coefficients, using only the operations of the coefficient ring. This quotient was given the name generalized characteristic polynomial by Canny <ref> [7] </ref> because it specializes in the case of linear equations to the characteristic polynomial of the matrix of the linear system. Recently such polynomials have found wide use in extending resultants and u-resultants to the case of affine (inhomogeneous) sets. <p> What we would like is a guaranteed method of obtaining all proper solutions to the original system|perhaps together with a finite number of the improper solutions|in the manner that the u-resultant provides for the strictly homogeneous case. This is given by the following lemma, proved by Canny <ref> [7] </ref> for the case k = C and by Ierardi [12, Ch. 4] for fields of arbitrary characteristic. We state the lemma only in its simplest form.
