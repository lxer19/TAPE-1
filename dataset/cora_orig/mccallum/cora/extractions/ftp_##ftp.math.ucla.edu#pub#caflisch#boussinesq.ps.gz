Abstract: Analysis and computations are presented for singularities in the solution of the steady Boussinesq equations for two-dimensional, stratified flow. The results show that for codimension 1 singularities, there are two generic singularity types for general solutions, and only one generic singularity type if there is a certain symmetry present. The analysis depends on a special choice of coordinates, which greatly simplifies the equations, showing that the type is exactly that of one dimensional Legendrian singularities, generalized so that the velocity

Reference-contexts: Siggia [16] performed numerical computations for (1.3), which seemed to indicate singularity formation, but further computations by E and Shu [11] did not confirm their results. 5 A clearcut numerical demonstration of singularities for the Euler equation for axisymmetric flow with swirl, but for complex velocity, was performed by Caflisch <ref> [3] </ref> using a special form of the solution for which the numerical error is extremely small. The computed solutions had singularities of the simple form u x 1=3 , which suggested that this singularity might be generic. <p> In this paper, these numerical singularity results are used instead to indicate the generic form of singularities for the steady flow problem. The singular solutions constructed in <ref> [3] </ref> were traveling waves (with imaginary speed), but by Galilean transformation they become steady solutions. In the present investigation, numerical solutions with complex singularities are constructed for the steady Boussinesq equations by a similar procedure as in [3]. <p> The singular solutions constructed in <ref> [3] </ref> were traveling waves (with imaginary speed), but by Galilean transformation they become steady solutions.

That analysis used a generalization of the hodograph transformation to unfold the differential equations.

Reference-contexts: That analysis used a generalization of the hodograph transformation to unfold the differential equations. While that unfolding transformation has been generalized <ref> [4] </ref> to a larger class of equations, including the Boussinesq equations or the Euler equations for axisymmetric flow with swirl, the analysis in the present study is effected through a simpler and more direct transformation of the equations.

Reference-contexts: For example, the 3 present analysis includes solutions with infinite values of the the velocity and vorticity.

The principal ingredient in this study will be a geometric approach to differential equations, which has been developed by two of the present authors and their co-workers for simpler systems in <ref> [5] </ref>, as well as by Bryant, Griffiths and Hsu [17, 18].
