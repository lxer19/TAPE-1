Title: Stamping Process Fault Classification Using Singular Value Decomposition  
Author: Christopher K. H. Koh Jianjun Shi 
Affiliation: School of Mechanical and Production Engineering Nanyang Technological University  Industrial and Operations Engineering Department University of Michigan  
Abstract: Sheet metal stamping is a very complex process due to the number of process variables involved. Consequently, just as many faults could occur during the process cycle when one or more of these variables deviate beyond tolerance. The tonnage generated during the process is measured by strain gages mounted on the press, and provide a non-invasive means of process monitoring. The singular value decomposition (SVD) approach is proposed as a suitable classification tool for dealing with the large number of faults embedded in these tonnage signals. The decision boundaries are drawn by a set of linear discriminant functions based on the minimum distance criteria.

Reference-contexts: Type of signal change. Faults associated with the structural integrity of the press (e.g. component failure, structural cracks) alter the transfer function, and hence the frequency response of the system. This change is termed non-additive and is better represented in the frequency domain than in the time domain <ref> [2] </ref>. Another advantage of the frequency domain approach is the substantial reduction in data. Only the first N=2 Fourier coefficients for a N-point data are useful because of the symmetry of the DFT. Of these, the higher Fourier coefficients may be neglected as they contain mostly noise terms.

Reference-contexts: Since q &lt;< p in general, the computational effort required is manageable even for on-line implementation. The computational load for determining the basis vectors can be further reduced by using sparse algorithms <ref> [4] </ref> for the SVD operation. These reduced precision algorithms are justifiable for the following reasons. * Matrix A contains production data which often has a high level of noise.

Reference-contexts: Structural dynamics of the press. Since the fundamental tonnage signature does not have a sinusoidal structure, the Haar transform generally provides a better representation of the signal than the Fourier transform <ref> [7] </ref>. However, some faults do produce highly localized oscillatory signatures. It will be easier to separate these signals in the frequency domain than the time domain. Examples of these are gear noise, gib chatter and worn bushings [7]. 3.

Reference-contexts: Misalignment of signals in the time domain is captured as phase information in the frequency domain. Singular value decomposition of the magnitude of the frequency spectra is thus unaffected by any mismatched in the ensemble of observations <ref> [8] </ref> if the window is large enough. It is thus easier to classify such signals using frequency spectra information rather than the original time series data. However, when misalignment of signals is not an issue, the frequency domain SVD classifier does not always guarantee better results. 6 2.
