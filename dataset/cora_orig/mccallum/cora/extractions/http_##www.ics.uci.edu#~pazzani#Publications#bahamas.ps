Abstract: A rule-based expert system, CTSHIV (Customized Treatment Strategies for HIV) that recommends an individualized treatment strategy for HIV patients is described. Since the HIV virus mutates rapidly, a patient can develop a resistance to particular antiretroviral agents. CTSHIV addresses this problem by recommending a treatment strategy that avoids antiretro-viral agents for which a resistance has developed. By monitoring the HIV virus of the patient, the treatment strategy can be switched in response to mutations of the virus. CTSHIV contains a knowledge base that encodes information from the medical literature on drug-resistant mutations. It also contains additional rules that rank and weight combinations of antiretro-viral agents based upon antiviral activities, redundant mechanisms of action, and overlapping toxici-ties. To recommend a treatment for an HIV-infected patient, plasma is obtained from the patient and the RNA extracted. Segments of the HIV pol gene encoding the entire protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase proteins are amplified by RT-PCR (using a total of 3 primer pairs) and cloned. The patient's HIV sequencing data is entered into the expert program and the information is downloaded directly into the CTSHIV program. The program produces the five most effective 2, 3, and 4 drug regimens coupled with an explanation for their choice. Thus, the CTSHIV system couples efficient genetic sequencing with an expert program that recommends regimens based upon information in the current medical literature. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate the effectiveness of this novel approach to the management of HIV-infected patients.

Reference-contexts: Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated that treatment with these agents can improve clinical outcomes such as mortality, occurrence of opportunistic infections and progression to AIDS [3,4,5,6,7]. Therapy with a combination of agents appears to be superior to monotherapy <ref> [8] </ref>. Unfortunately, current therapeutic regimens result in suppression but not eradication of HIV. Furthermore, antiretroviral therapy is limited by the invariable development of resistance. A variety of studies have demonstrated that resistance is associated with specific mutations in the HIV pol gene [9,10,11,12].

Reference-contexts: The rule is derived from the literature which reports that a Methionine to Leucine mutation at codon 41 confers high-level resistance to AZT (&gt;100-fold resistance <ref> [9] </ref>). The weight associated with a rule is not a confidence as in many expert systems. Rather, it should be viewed as part of the conclusion. The conclusions are weighted from 0.1 (low) to 1.0 (high) based upon expert advise and the reported level of resistance in the literature.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the current procedure used in practice for the treatment of HIV-infected patients is considerably more ad hoc and less informed than the procedure implemented in CTSHIV. Second, when enough patient data has been collected, a learning algorithm such as FOCL <ref> [14] </ref> might be applied to the program to suggest rule modifications based upon outcome measures from patients such as CD4 count, viral load, and progression to AIDS. New rules can be proposed by the learning system for review and confirmation.
