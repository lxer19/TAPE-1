Reference-contexts: All-pairs reliable and private communication is possible whenever all-pairs reliable communication is. Reliable and private communication from a to b is possible whenever we have reliable communication from a to b and from b to a. As shown by Ben-Or et al. <ref> [1] </ref> and Chaum et al. [3], all-pairs reliable and private communication implies the possibility of any secure multiparty computation (when less than a third of the parties are maliciously faulty).

Reference-contexts: The transmitter a then encrypts the message using the sum of the pads that pass the test, and sends this encryption to b reliably and non-privately. We use universal hashing <ref> [2, 13] </ref> for the randomized authentication procedure, and perform all arithmetic in a large finite field F. We first argue that this protocol is reliable with high probability. Lemma 6.2 Assume that jFj 3n=* and each reliable non-private transmission is (t; *=3)- reliable. Then, Protocol PRIVATE-TRANSMISSION is (t; *)-reliable.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Suppose that some processors are connected by a network of reliable channels. All of the processors cooperate to execute some protocol, but some of them are maliciously faulty. Dolev <ref> [4] </ref> and Dolev et al. [5] proved that if there are t faulty processors, then every pair of processors can communicate reliably if and only if the network is (2t + 1)-connected. What happens if we want to tolerate more faulty processors? Adding more reliable channels is costly. <p> Historical notes: The connectivity requirements for several distributed tasks in several models has been studied in many papers; for example Byzantine agreement <ref> [4] </ref>, approximate Byzantine agreement [6], reliable message transmission [4, 5], and reliable and private message transmission [11, 5]. Simple impossibility results and more references can be found in [8]. <p> Historical notes: The connectivity requirements for several distributed tasks in several models has been studied in many papers; for example Byzantine agreement [4], approximate Byzantine agreement [6], reliable message transmission <ref> [4, 5] </ref>, and reliable and private message transmission [11, 5]. Simple impossibility results and more references can be found in [8]. We mention that in Byzantine agreement all honest parties should agree on the same message while in reliable communication only the transmitter and the receiver agree on the message.

Reference-contexts: Menger [10] proved that a graph G is (t; u; v)-connected if and only if hu; vi 2 E or there exists t vertex disjoint paths between u and v. Furthermore, there is an efficient algorithm that checks whether a graph is (t; u; v)-connected (for details see e.g. <ref> [7] </ref>). Notice that if there is an edge between u and v then the graph is (t; u; v)-connected for every t and there is no (u; v)-separating set. 3 All-Pairs Reliable Communication In this section we characterize when reliable transmission between every pair of parties is possible.

We mention that in Byzantine agreement all honest parties should agree on the same message while in reliable communication only the transmitter and the receiver agree on the message. To the best of our knowledge, none of the previous papers considered how to strengthen reliability by adding authentication keys.

Reference-contexts: We present a general protocol for private and reliable transmission that succeeds if G is (t + 1; a; b)-connected and reliable communication is possible. This protocol is also presented in <ref> [9] </ref>. We use this protocol to show that for both all-pairs and single-pair, the sufficiency condition for reliable communication from a to b and from b to a is a sufficient condition for reliable communication with privacy. We formally define private transmission.

Reference-contexts: A graph G = hV; Ei is (t + 1; u; v)-connected if there is no (u; v)-separating set of size at most t. A graph G is t-connected if it is (t; u; v)-connected for every pair of vertices in the graph. Menger <ref> [10] </ref> proved that a graph G is (t; u; v)-connected if and only if hu; vi 2 E or there exists t vertex disjoint paths between u and v. Furthermore, there is an efficient algorithm that checks whether a graph is (t; u; v)-connected (for details see e.g. [7]).

Reference-contexts: A message transmission is (t; *)-reliable if it is (ALL t ; *)-reliable, where ALL t = fT V n fa; bg : jT j tg. 2.2 Authentication Schemes We briefly define authentication schemes; the reader is referred to <ref> [12] </ref> for more details. Let K be a finite set, called the set of keys. An authentication scheme is a pair hauth; i, where - 4 - auth : f0; 1g fl fl is a function, and is a probability distribution on the set of keys, K.
