Abstract: We have defined a simple model of classification which combines human provided expert knowledge with probabilistic reasoning. We have developed software to implement this model and have applied it to the problem of classifying proteins into their various cellular localization sites based on their amino acid sequences. Since our system requires no hand tuning to learn training data, we can now evaluate the prediction accuracy of protein localization sites by a more objective cross-validation method than earlier studies using production rule type expert systems. 336 E.coli proteins were classified into 8 classes with an accuracy of 81% while 1484 yeast proteins were classified into 10 classes with an accuracy of 55%. Additionally we report empirical results using three different strategies for handling continuously valued variables in our probabilistic reasoning system.

Reference-contexts: The localization site of a protein within a cell is primarily determined by its amino acid sequence. Nakai and Kanehisa have exploited this fact to develop a rule based expert system for classifying proteins into their various cellular localization sites, using their amino acid sequences, in gram-negative bacteria <ref> (Nakai & Kanehisa 1991) </ref> and in eukaryotic cells (Nakai & Kane-hisa 1992). These expert systems can predict the localization sites of protein sequences with good accuracy once appropriate certainty factors have been given to each rule. <p> The classification tree used is shown in figure 2. These classifications and features are discussed in detail by Nakai and Kanehisa <ref> (Nakai & Kanehisa 1991) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For this reason we believe that probabilistic reasoning systems are very promising as a tool in computational biology. Based on probability theory, probabilistic reasoning is inherently designed to handle uncertainty, and has been shown to have a wide range of applications <ref> (Pearl 1992) </ref>. In this paper we describe a model for classification which can be viewed either as a probabilistic analog to decision trees or as a restricted form of Bayesian network. The localization site of a protein within a cell is primarily determined by its amino acid sequence.
