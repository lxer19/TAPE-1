Abstract: An information-theoretic model for steganography with passive adversaries is proposed. The adversary's task of distinguishing between an innocent cover message C and a modified message S containing a secret part is interpreted as a hypothesis testing problem. The security of a steganographic system is quantified in terms of the relative entropy (or discrimination) between P C and P S . Several secure steganographic schemes are presented in this model; one of them is a universal information hiding scheme based on universal data compression techniques that requires no knowledge of the covertext statistics.

Reference-contexts: Motivated by growing concern about the protection of intellectual property on the Internet and by the threat of a ban for encryption technology, the interest in techniques for information hiding has been increasing over the recent years <ref> [And96] </ref>. Two general directions can be distinguished within information hiding scenarios: protection only against the detection of a message by a passive adversary and hiding a message such that not even an active adversary can remove it. A survey of current steganography can be found in [AP98].

Reference-contexts: A universal information hiding scheme that requires no knowledge of the covertext statistics is presented in Section 5. It is based on a universal data 2 compression algorithm, which is similar to the well-known Lempel-Ziv algorithms <ref> [ZL77, BCW90] </ref>. Some extensions and conclusions are given in Section 6. 2 Review of Hypothesis Testing We give a brief introduction to hypothesis testing and to information-theoretic notions (see [Bla87, CT91]). Logarithms are to the base 2. The cardinality of a set S is denoted by jSj. <p> Essentially, this is accomplished by learning the statistics of the data during operation as more and more data is observed. The best known examples of universal data compression are the algorithms by Lempel and Ziv <ref> [ZL77, BCW90] </ref>. We describe a universal data compression algorithm based on the concept of repetition times due to Willems [Wil89], which is related to Elias' interval length coding [Eli87]. Then we modify the algorithm to illustrate that a stegosystem can be constructed without knowledge of the covertext distribution.

Reference-contexts: A number of generic hiding techniques have been developed whose effects are barely perceptible for humans but can withstand tampering by data transformations that essentially conserve its contents <ref> [CKLS96, BGML96] </ref>. A common model and terminology for information hiding has been established at the 1996 Information Hiding Workshop [Pfi96]. An original, unaltered message is called covertext; the sender Alice tries to hide an embedded message by transforming the covertext using a secret key.

Reference-contexts: This is the problem of distinguishing two different explanations for the observed data that is investigated in statistics and in information theory as "hypothesis testing." We follow the information-theoretic (non-Bayesian) approach as presented by Blahut <ref> [Bla87] </ref> using the relative entropy function as the basic measure of the information contained in an observation. Thus, we use the relative entropy D (P C kP S ) between P C and P S to quantify the security of a steganographic system (or stegosystem for short) against passive attacks. <p> It is based on a universal data 2 compression algorithm, which is similar to the well-known Lempel-Ziv algorithms [ZL77, BCW90]. Some extensions and conclusions are given in Section 6. 2 Review of Hypothesis Testing We give a brief introduction to hypothesis testing and to information-theoretic notions (see <ref> [Bla87, CT91] </ref>). Logarithms are to the base 2. The cardinality of a set S is denoted by jSj. <p> Hypothesis testing is the task of deciding which one of two hypotheses H 0 or H 1 is the true explanation for an observed measurement Q <ref> [Bla87] </ref>. In other words, there are two possible probability distributions, denoted by P Q 0 and P Q 1 , over the space Q of possible measurements.

Alice can use the techniques described below for embedding information; however, to achieve robustness against active adversaries who modify the image, more sophisticated coding methods are necessary (see e.g. <ref> [CKLS96] </ref>). It may be the case that external events influence the covertext distribution; for example, news reports or the local weather if we think of the prisoners' problem. This external information is denoted by Y and known all participants. Our model and the security definition above can be modified accordingly.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, we believe that our model provides insight in steganography. We hope that it can serve also as a starting point for further work to formalize active adversaries or computational security. (A game-theoretic approach to information hiding with active adversaries is presented by Ettinger <ref> [Ett98] </ref>.) A first extension would be to model the covertext source as a stochastic process and consider statistical estimation and decision techniques. Another idea would be to value the possible decisions and use the methods of statistical decision theory [Ber85].

Reference-contexts: Thus, the one-time pad provides perfect steganographic security if the covertext is uniformly random. As a side remark, we note that this one-time pad system is equivalent to the basic scheme of visual cryptography <ref> [NS95] </ref>. This technique hides a monochrome picture by splitting it into two random layers of dots. When these are superimposed, the picture appears. It is also possible to produce two innocent looking pictures such that both of them together reveal an embedded message.

For information hiding on the other hand, the relation between the model and its validity is more involved.

Encoding and decoding therefore take only a constant number of operations per block. The formal analysis of the scheme <ref> [Wil89] </ref> using D = L shows that for L ! 1, the encoding rate (the average number of code bits per source word) converges to the entropy rate of the source X.
