Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of geocasting in mobile ad hoc network (MANET) environments. Geocast-ing is a variant of the conventional multicasting problem. For multicasting, conventional protocols define a multicast group as a collection of hosts which register to a multicast group address. However, for geocasting, the group consists of the set of all nodes within a specified geographical region. Hosts within the specified region at a given time form the geocast group at that time. We present two different algorithms for delivering packets to such a group, and present simulation results.

In our discussion, we assume that each host knows its current location precisely (i.e., no error). However, our algorithms can be easily extended to take location error into account, similar to the routing algorithms in [15].

Reference-contexts: Cost considerations are all the more important for a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) consisting of mobile hosts that communicate with each other over wireless links, in the absence of a fixed infrastructure <ref> [2] </ref>. In MANET environments, the mul-ticast problem is more complex because topology change of the network is extremely dynamic and relatively unpredictable. To do multicasting, some way is needed to define mul-ticast groups.

Reference-contexts: the cone-shaped forwarding zone may also be adapted as shown in Figure 9 (b). 5.3 Use of Directed Antennas The basic location-based multicast schemes can be improved upon by using directed antennas. (Note that, in general, mobile hosts in the MANET are assumed to have omnidirectional antennas for wireless communication <ref> [9] </ref>.) Let us consider the Figure 10, in which node S needs to send multicast data packets to all nodes in the multicast region. Let us also assume that location-based multicast scheme 1 is used for this data delivery with omnidirectional antennas.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the mul-ticast may be performed using some sort of flooding scheme. As elaborated below, this is the approach taken in this paper. 3.1 Multicast Flooding Flooding is probably the simplest multicast routing algorithm <ref> [12] </ref>. The flooding algorithm can be used to deliver packets to nodes within a location-based multicast group. The multicast flooding algorithm can be implemented as follows: Assume that a node S needs to send a packet to a specific multicast region, a circle in Figure 1.

Multicast Region and Forwarding Zone Multicast Region: Consider a node S that needs to multi-cast a message to all nodes that are currently located within a certain geographical region. We call this specific area as Multicast Region. <p> A node forwards the multicast packet only if it belongs to the forwarding zone (unlike the multicast flooding algorithm in Section 3.1). Forwarding zone defined here for multicasting is similar to that defined for unicast routing in <ref> [15] </ref>. To increase the probability that a data packet will reach all members in the multicast group, the forwarding zone should include the multicast region (described above). Additionally, the forwarding zone may also include other areas around the multicast region. <p> Thus, implementing location-based multicast schemes requires that a node be able to determine if it is in the forwarding zone for a particular multicast packet two algorithms presented here differ in the manner in which this determination is made.
