Abstract: Efficient browsing and retrieval of geographically referenced information requires the allocation of data on different storage devices for concurrent retrieval. By dividing a two dimensional space into tiles, a system can allow users to specify regions of interest using a query rectangle and then retrieving all information related to tiles overlapping with the query. In this paper, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for strictly optimal allocations of two-dimensional data. These methods, when they exist, guarantee that for any query, the minimum number of tiles are assigned the same storage device, and hence ensures maximal retrieval concurrency.

Reference-contexts: Optimality results for partial match queries have been derived <ref> [AE93] </ref>. However, for range queries, only a few allocation methods have been proposed [Fal88,GD90,GDQ92,CC92,LSR92,CR93]. Ghandeharizadeh, DeWitt and Qureshi [GD90,GDQ92] demonstrated, using simulation, that declustering data on multiple disks results in significant improve ments in response time for range queries.

Reference-contexts: However, the search is restricted to a certain class of allocation methods called vector based declustering and no closed form solution is presented. Chen and Chang in <ref> [CC92] </ref> study the disk modulo allocation method for range queries and give sufficient (but not necessary) conditions for strict optimality. This method was originally developed by Du and Sobolewski for partial match queries [DS82]. <p> This method was originally developed by Du and Sobolewski for partial match queries [DS82]. For two-dimensions, and using the language of our paper, the allocation method assigns the number x + y mod M to the tile represented by (x; y). It is shown in <ref> [CC92] </ref> that the method is strictly optimal if M = 2 or 3. This result, in two-dimensions, follows from Lemma 1 which states that the assignment bM=2cx + y mod M is strictly optimal if M 2 f1; 2; 3; 5g. In conclusion, the contributions of this paper are twofold.

Reference-contexts: Previous research concentrated on efficient retrieval of images for circular queries [CR93] and, more generally, on the disk allocation of relational databases for range queries [Fal88,LSR92,CC92], as well as the organization of raster-graphics memory <ref> [CLRS86] </ref>. <p> A closely related problem to the M -assignment of two dimensional data arises in graphical interfaces where clustered pixels are stored on different memory chips for simultaneous access. Chor, Leiserson, Rivest, and Shearer <ref> [CLRS86] </ref> present an almost optimal technique based on a Fibonacci lattice to accomplish this task.

Reference-contexts: In the cases where an optimal allocation method exists, we provide simple allocation methods that can be easily implemented. Previous research concentrated on efficient retrieval of images for circular queries <ref> [CR93] </ref> and, more generally, on the disk allocation of relational databases for range queries [Fal88,LSR92,CC92], as well as the organization of raster-graphics memory [CLRS86]. <p> Experiments show that decluster-ing using these techniques provide further improvements in response time. The CMD method proposed by Li et al. [LSR92] also uses a modulo approach for allocating data on disks, however no optimality conditions have been derived. In <ref> [CR93] </ref>, a declustering algorithm is proposed for images and maps where queries are defined by a circle around a point of interest rather than a rectangle.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, the user may request that pictures of famous historical monuments located in cities in the selected region be displayed. Efficient support of such queries is quite important for image databases in particular, and for browsing geographically referenced information in general. In the Alexandria Digital Library project <ref> [Smi96] </ref>, a large satellite image is often divided into tiles and each tile is decomposed using wavelet decomposition [VH92].

Reference-contexts: Efficient support of such queries is quite important for image databases in particular, and for browsing geographically referenced information in general. In the Alexandria Digital Library project [Smi96], a large satellite image is often divided into tiles and each tile is decomposed using wavelet decomposition <ref> [VH92] </ref>. A wavelet decomposition of an image results in a lower resolution image of the original image, in addition to higher order coefficients that can be used to retrieve higher resolution versions of the same image. <p> In particular, each tile in the lower resolution image grid can be expanded into the next higher resolution image using three coefficients <ref> [VH92] </ref>. Hence, assuming we have 15 parallel I/O devices, we cluster them into 5 groups, each with 3 disks. Theorem 1 is first used to partition the tiles among the 5 groups (there is a strictly optimal solution for this case).
