Title: Multiscale Spatial Architectures for Complex Information Spaces  
Author: Brygg Ullmer 
Abstract: Traditional browsing and querying information navigation techniques lose valuable contextual information by artificially partitioning information spaces. We introduce an architecture supporting the presentation of spatialized information which preserves spatial continuity (elim-inating arbitrary partitioning) while maintaining support for unbounded volumes of distributed information. The multiscale structure enabling this functionality is discussed, and the role of spatial continuity in realizing both the presence and relation of dynamic information is described. Finally, the possible union between new spatialized information technologies and mainstream Internet distributed information systems is explored.

Reference-contexts: B.1 The Cellular class Beginning our discussion with the cellular class, we structure space into a series of recursive cubical units in a manner somewhat similar to recursive quadtrees. <ref> [2] </ref> Unlike quadtrees, however, we do not provide links for cellulars to spatially adjacent cel-lulars at a particular scale, instead only providing linkages to child and parent cellulars across adjoining scales at a given spatial location. This has important ramifications for both spatial dynamics and distributed operation of large spaces.

Reference-contexts: While we have much interest and some history in addressing the challenges of spatial information representations <ref> [10] </ref> and interaction, we view the second challenge | the derivation of a fundamental architecture for highly-populated spatialized information systems | as even more critical, since such architectures underly all possible spatial representation and interaction paradigms (at least so far as these paradigms support spatial continuity). <p> Acknowledgements The author would like to thank Dr. Terry Wino-grad, Sean White, and others at Interval Research Corporation for their support of the summer 1993 dynamic information systems research <ref> [10] </ref> leading into the present multiscale development.
