Abstract: Crisis domains present the challenge of developing good responses in a timely manner. In this paper, we present an interactive, case-based approach to crisis response that provides users with the ability to rapidly develop good responses while leaving ultimate decision-making control to the users. We introduce Inca, the INteractive Crisis Assistant we have implemented for planning and scheduling in crisis domains. We also present Haz-Mat, the artificial domain involving hazardous material incidents that we developed for the purpose of evaluating different responses and various assistant mechanisms. We then discuss two preliminary studies that we conducted to evaluate scheduling assistance in Inca. Results from the first set of experiments indicate that Inca's case-based scheduling assistance provides users with initial candidate solutions that enable users to develop high quality responses more quickly. The second set of experiments demonstrates the potential of machine learning methods to further facilitate interactive scheduling by accurately predicting preferred user adaptations. Based on these encouraging results, we close with directions for future work and a brief discussion of related research.

Reference-contexts: With the importance of the human-computer interface in mixed-initiative systems, there has also been interest in developing more natural interfaces, such as the speech interface in TRAINS-95 <ref> (Ferguson et al., 1996) </ref>, a planning assistant for train routing. Most of these interactive systems aid users in developing solutions from scratch. In contrast, Inca aids users in adapting solutions from previous cases. This paper also focused on the evalua-tion of the scheduling assistance in Inca.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Responding to crises like natural disasters and military invasions is a complex activity that stands to benefit from computational aids. Crisis response has a number of characteristics, which we review elsewhere <ref> (Gervasio & Iba, 1997) </ref>, that distinguish it from other problems involving the generation of plans and schedules. <p> In the final section, we discuss related work and outline some areas for future work. The Hazardous Materials Domain The hazardous materials domain exhibits the three primary themes of crisis: threat, urgency, and uncertainty <ref> (Gervasio & Iba, 1997) </ref>. A hazardous materials incident occurs when a spill of some material with hazardous properties poses a threat to humans, property, or the environment. This entails a sense of urgency in that delays in responding to the situation typically result in more negative environmental and economic consequences.

Reference-contexts: The results reported in the next section were obtained by running ID3 (Quinlan, 1986) over ten trials on each data set, with each trial using 800 randomly chosen examples for training and the rest for testing. See <ref> (Gervasio et al., 1998) </ref> for more details on these learning experiments. A baseline study (Figure 4, base) showed that predictive accuracy after learning was significantly better than guessing randomly (1.02%) and guessing the most frequent class (8.57%).

Reference-contexts: Most of these interactive systems aid users in developing solutions from scratch. In contrast, Inca aids users in adapting solutions from previous cases. This paper also focused on the evalua-tion of the scheduling assistance in Inca. CLAVIER <ref> (Hinkle & Toomey, 1994) </ref> is an advisory system for autoclave loading that, like Inca, retrieves previous cases for users who can then interact with the system to perform additional modifications. Inca differs in its domain and consequent focus on planning and scheduling.

Reference-contexts: Each subject solved fifty problems in the no seed condition and thirty problems in each of the remaining conditions. For further details on these experiments, see <ref> (Iba et al., 1998) </ref>. Experimental Hypotheses and Results We expected seeding to facilitate the development of a response, since it starts the scheduling process with a partial solution.

Reference-contexts: Inca retrieves plans and schedules from previous cases, and then lets the user interactively adapt them using repair-space operators. Interactive systems present the opportunity to gather traces of user behavior and the potential to learn user models. An adaptive user interface <ref> (Langley, 1997) </ref> can capitalize on regularities in users' behavior by presenting preferred options as default selections, or by more carefully exploring the search space of problem states that the user is likely to traverse. Inca exploits learned user models by recommending the most probable adaptation operations during scheduling. <p> Predicting User Adaptations The second set of experiments was motivated by our long-term objective for Inca to become an adaptive user interface <ref> (Langley, 1997) </ref>. We claim that machine learning can be used to acquire user models that can be used to adapt system behavior to better assist users. We begin by presenting our formulation of the learning problem before discussing the experiments and results.

Inca differs in its domain and consequent focus on planning and scheduling. DIAL <ref> (Leake, 1996) </ref> is a case-based planner for disaster response, whose adaptation process is predominantly automated, in contrast to the interactive case adaptation process in Inca.

Reference-contexts: The Idealized HAZMAT World We have developed an artificial hazardous materials world, HazMat, for the purpose of evaluating problem solvers' responses to hazardous materials incidents. In developing HazMat, we consulted the 1996 North American Emergency Response Guidebook (NAERG) <ref> (Transport Canada et al., 1996) </ref>, a handbook for first responders that describes the appropriate responses for different hazardous materials situations. It provides information on the classification of hazardous materials and the different actions and resources involved in a response.

Reference-contexts: DIAL (Leake, 1996) is a case-based planner for disaster response, whose adaptation process is predominantly automated, in contrast to the interactive case adaptation process in Inca. DIAL also learns adaptation cases, in contrast to the solution cases in Inca. CABINS <ref> (Miyashita & Sycara, 1995) </ref> is an interactive assistant that uses case-based methods to learn user preferences for job-shop scheduling. Like CABINS, Inca incorporates learning mechanisms that let it adapt its assistant behavior to different individuals.

Reference-contexts: Previous systems for crisis response have been predominantly autonomous in nature. More recent systems often provide interactive modes that let human users directly control the plan development process (e.g., OPLAN-2 <ref> (Tate et al., 1994) </ref>, SOCAP (Bi-enkowski, 1996)). Like these systems, the INteractive Crisis Assistant (Inca) that we present in this paper provides various forms of computational support while allowing crisis managers to control the development of a crisis response.
