Abstract: We present the design of the Virtual Microscope, a software system employing a client/server architecture to provide a realistic emulation of a high power light microscope. We discuss several technical challenges related to providing the performance necessary to achieve rapid response time, mainly in dealing with the enormous amounts of data (tens to hundreds of gigabytes per slide) that must be retrieved from secondary storage and processed. To effectively implement the data server, the system design relies on the computational power and high I/O throughput available from an appropriately configured parallel computer.

Reference-contexts: Compression will also reduce the amount of I/O required for the server to respond to a query, but will increase the amount of computation required to produce an image to return to the user. Many different compression algorithms have been proposed in the literature (e.g. JPEG <ref> [8] </ref>), but the Virtual Microscope requires both a high degree of compression and a low loss of information. This reduces the search for compression techniques to a small number of methods, and we are using a wavelet compression technique [9].

Besides reducing storage and I/O requirements, the wavelet compression technique has other useful performance characteristics.
