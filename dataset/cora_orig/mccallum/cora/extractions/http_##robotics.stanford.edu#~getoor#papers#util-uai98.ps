Abstract: We investigate the application of classification techniques to utility elicitation. In a decision problem, two sets of parameters must generally be elicited: the probabilities and the utilities. While the prior and conditional probabilities in the model do not change from user to user, the utility models do. Thus it is necessary to elicit a utility model separately for each new user. Elicitation is long and tedious, particularly if the outcome space is large and not decomposable. There are two common approaches to utility function elicitation. The first is to base the determination of the user's utility function solely on elicitation of qualitative preferences. The second makes assumptions about the form and decomposability of the utility function. Here we take a different approach: we attempt to identify the new user's utility function based on classification relative to a database of previously collected utility functions. We do this by identifying clusters of utility functions that minimize an appropriate distance measure. Having identified the clusters, we develop a classification scheme that requires many fewer and simpler assessments than full utility elicitation and is more robust than utility elicitation based solely on preferences. We have tested our algorithm on a small database of utility functions in a prenatal diagnosis domain and the results are quite promising.

Reference-contexts: Preference splits are of the form Is outcome o i preferred to outcome o j ? Preference splits are a special type of linear combination splits. These linear combination splits are supported in some of the more sophisticated decision tree packages, such as CART <ref> (Breiman et al. 1984) </ref>; here, by using the domain knowledge and looking only at preference splits, we need to consider only a small subset of all the possible linear combination splits.

Reference-contexts: Decomposed functions are easier to elicit and can allow more efficient reasoning procedures. Common approaches restrict attention to additive models (Hornberger et al. 1995; Linden et al. 1997), and partial elicitation of models <ref> (Ha and Haddawy 1997) </ref>. In many cases, however, attributes are preferentially dependent and thus assumptions of decomposability are suspect. An incorrect assumption of decomposability can adversely affect our choice of actions. This problem suggests that we should perform full utility elicitation.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION Probabilistic systems, such as Bayesian networks (Pearl 1988) and influence diagrams <ref> (Howard and Matheson 1984) </ref> are a major research focus and have been gaining popularity in a number of application domains. Many systems based on them are now in use. Some of these systems, especially those used in medical domains, are designed to give advice to large numbers of users.

Reference-contexts: This lack of data fragmentation is one of the benefits of this approach. 3.2 CLUSTERING THE UTILITY FUNCTIONS Clustering algorithms come in two general flavors, partitioning methods (such as k-means) and hierarchical methods <ref> (Willett 1988) </ref>. In general, hierarchical methods are faster than partitioning methods. We are concerned about the efficiency of our algorithm, since it may be done in an online setting. Therefore, we chose a hierarchical agglom erative clustering algorithm.
