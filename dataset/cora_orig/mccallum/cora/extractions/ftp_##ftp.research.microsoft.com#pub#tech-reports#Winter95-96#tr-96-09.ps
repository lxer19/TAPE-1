Reference-contexts: Also, while other systems tend to rely on RAID disk arrays [Patterson et al. 88] to provide fault tolerance, Tiger will transparently tolerate failures of both individual disks and entire server machines. As well as striping across disks in an array Tiger stripes data across server machines. <ref> [Berson et al. 94] </ref> proposes an independently developed single-machine disk striping algorithm with some similarities to that used by Tiger. 8. Conclusions Tiger is a successful exercise in providing data and bandwidth-intensive computing via a collection of commodity components.

Reference-contexts: When a cub receives a request for new service, it selects the next unused schedule slot that will be processed by the disk holding the viewer's first block. This task is isomorphic to inserting an element into an open hash table with sequential chaining. Knuth <ref> [Knuth 73] </ref> reports that, on average, this takes (1+1/(1-a)^2)/2 probes, where a is the fraction of the slots that are full. In Tiger, the duration of a probe is one block service time.

Reference-contexts: Related Work Tiger systems are typically built entirely of commodity hardware components, allowing them to take advantage of commodity hardware price curves. By contrast, other commercial video servers, such as those produced by Silicon Graphics [Nelson et al. 95] and Oracle <ref> [Laursen et al. 94] </ref>, tend to rely on supercomputer backplane speeds or massively parallel memory and I/O systems in order to provide the needed bandwidth.
