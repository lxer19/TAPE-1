Reference-contexts: One promising approach for enhancing information retrieval through the Internet is visualization to facilitate users' perception of document relation structure. A number of systems have been developed to provide visually based browsing mechanisms for traversing the link structure of Internet documents <ref> [49, 2, 40, 53] </ref>, typically in a three dimensional or distorted space. Unfortunatley, link connectivity shows relatively little about the topic relations among documents across the Internel. Systems which provide facilities for organizing and viewing document organizations based on semantic content are an alternative.

Reference-contexts: Display and interaction mechanisms in the Document Explorer supply orientation and overview of the global structure of document associations, together with navigation and retrieval tools for exploring local detail. Overview diagrams <ref> [3] </ref> display a small number of nodes selected to provide information about the organization of the complete networks. These nodes provide orientation by serving as landmarks to assist the user in knowing what part of the network is currently being viewed.

Reference-contexts: We allow the user to label a guessed concept for the search algorithm. As we will describe, a target concept (the desired information, or the desired home page) is represented by an axis-parallel rectangle over a discretized vector space, the existing machine learning theory regarding rectangles <ref> [4] </ref> can be applied to the Web search. However, those machine learning algorithms might not be able to work fast enough for practical use. We need to investigate other solutions. For example, we might be able to allow the user to provide more feedback than just labeling a guessed concept.

Reference-contexts: For the sorts of network displays in the Document Explorer there is an increase in users' abilities to perceive structure and perform three-dimensional interaction tasks, as found in a number of recent studies of stereoscopic network viewing, both with and without head position tracking <ref> [69, 5] </ref>. Recent attention to immersive interfaces has focused on head mounted displays (HMDs). <p> In HTS simple head movements easily and naturally change viewpoint to "look around" the objects. This viewing paradigm has been called "fish-tank virtual reality" and human factors experiments indicate enhanced perception and interaction in three dimensional tasks for HTS viewing compared to flat screen presentations <ref> [5] </ref>. The Document Explorer provides stereoscopic viewing together with untethered head position tracking for HTS viewing. The enhanced three-dimensional perception and interaction supplied by this display addresses the needs in our system to aid the user in perceiving structure and interacting with the system's large networks.

Reference-contexts: Examples in this category include Javelin [16] where clients and hosts register with brokers that help coordinate the work, ParaWeb [12] where clients use internet and intranet as a part of their computing infrastructure in a seamless fashion, and ATLAS <ref> [6] </ref> where hosts actively take work away from overloaded clients. Information engineering involves search, retrieval, indexing, categorizing, and visualizing various types of information accessed across the Internet. The Internet's massive amount of typically unstructured and often natural language based data requires approaches different than used in most database applications [26].

Reference-contexts: It is also clear that mechanisms providing alternative paths of access to information can enhance retrieval effectiveness <ref> [7] </ref>. One promising approach for enhancing information retrieval through the Internet is visualization to facilitate users' perception of document relation structure.

Reference-contexts: This is due in part to the inability to specify the aesthetic criteria individuals use in understanding graphs [22]. Nonetheless, for certain restricted classes of graphs in which graph-theoretic expressions of aesthetic criteria can be specified, satisfactory algorithms have been developed <ref> [8, 46, 58] </ref>. Some of the aesthetics for drawings of general undirected graphs are symmetry, minimization of edge crossings and bends in edges, uniform edge lengths, and uniform node distribution. These aesthetics are such that optimality of one may prevent optimality in others.

Reference-contexts: This sequence is used to assign distances between terms based on lexical distance and co-occurrence in syntactic units with a metric similar to that used by Belkin and Kwasnik <ref> [10] </ref>. Term pair similarity is calculated as the sum of values added when terms are adjacent, or occur in the same sentence, paragraph or document. These similarities provide the associations used in deriving the networks displayed by the system.

Reference-contexts: Systems which provide facilities for organizing and viewing document organizations based on semantic content are an alternative. Mukherjea, Foley, and Hudson [52] describe a system which operates on the semantic content of WWW documents to form visually displayed hierarchies. VR-VIBE <ref> [11] </ref> fixes WWW documents at locations in three-dimensional space by allowing users to interactively position keywords on a pyramid.

Reference-contexts: The key feature here is that the clients do not access data, only the computing power or storage capacity, on the hosts. Examples in this category include Javelin [16] where clients and hosts register with brokers that help coordinate the work, ParaWeb <ref> [12] </ref> where clients use internet and intranet as a part of their computing infrastructure in a seamless fashion, and ATLAS [6] where hosts actively take work away from overloaded clients.

Reference-contexts: The challenges are to guide users in formulating queries, to accurately locate relevant information among hosts, to properly index and rank the information, and to present it to users usefully. Harvest <ref> [13] </ref> is one of the pioneering and successful Internet information access and discovery systems. Harvest servers run on the client and index information in locally stored files. When a service is requested, the server reports the result through a pre-defined network interface. MetaCrawler [64] uses existing Internet search engines. <p> The lists can be provided by automatic content extraction tools, such as Harvest <ref> [13] </ref> or derived within the system. Keyword lists for each document are used to determine the associations among documents and among terms. The statistical text analyses rely on recovering conceptual information from natural language by considering the frequency and co-occurrence of words.

Reference-contexts: Users should be able to move through the system according to their needs without spatial or conceptual disorientation. Content-based structuring of hypertext document content was suggested by Bruza <ref> [14] </ref>. The approach uses a two-level architecture for hypertext documents where the top level "hyperindex" contains index information and the bottom level "hyperbase" contains content nodes and links. The hyperindex consists of a set of indices which are themselves linked together.

Reference-contexts: Tech--niques such as uncertainty sampling [45] reduce the amount of labeled data needed, but do not eliminate the labeling problem. Clustering techniques do not require labeled inputs, and have been applied successfully to large collections of documents <ref> [15] </ref>. Indeed, the Web offers fertile ground for document clustering research. However, because clustering techniques take weaker (unlabeled) inputs than other data mining techniques, they produce weaker (unlabeled) output.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Internet provides great opportunities, yet poses great challenges. Opportunities range from building a virtual supercomputer from home <ref> [68, 16] </ref>, to accessing digital libraries from classrooms [47] and searching for any piece of knowledge, e.g. the largest prime number [51, 33]. A great many challenges exist, including security, scalability, resource discovery, information extraction, and coordination of parallel computing activities. <p> The general model is that the clients needing extra computation or storage will access available resources offered by host computers. The key feature here is that the clients do not access data, only the computing power or storage capacity, on the hosts. Examples in this category include Javelin <ref> [16] </ref> where clients and hosts register with brokers that help coordinate the work, ParaWeb [12] where clients use internet and intranet as a part of their computing infrastructure in a seamless fashion, and ATLAS [6] where hosts actively take work away from overloaded clients.

Reference-contexts: The Pathfinder algorithm was developed to model semantic memory in humans and to provide a paradigm for scaling psychological similarity data [62]. A number of psychological and design studies have compared PfNets with other scaling techniques and found that they provide a useful tool for revealing conceptual structure <ref> [17, 61] </ref>. The PfNets representations underlying the system's network displays are minimum cost networks derived from measures of term and document associations. The network of documents is based on interdocument similarity, as measured by co-occurrence of keywords between document pairs.

Reference-contexts: Associative structures have been used effectively as one component of hybrid systems incorporating both deep and shallow representations <ref> [18] </ref>. 8 The final reason is the desire to provide a common visual representation for retrieval tools.

Reference-contexts: Graph drawing algorithms have as their goal the layout and presentation of an inherently mathematical entity in a manner which meets various criteria for human observation. The aesthetics of a layout determine its readability and can be formulated as optimization goals for the drawing algorithm <ref> [21] </ref>. For example, the display of symmetry and minimization of the number of edge crossings in two-dimensional drawings are fundamental aesthetics for visual presentations. Considering the wide application of graph structures in display, there are relatively few algorithms for drawing general undirected graphs [66].

Reference-contexts: These aesthetics are such that optimality of one may prevent optimality in others. Additionally, graph layout algorithms in general can be viewed as optimization problems and are typically NP-complete or NP-hard. These two observations suggest a heuristic approach to general graph drawing for many applications. The spring embedder algorithm <ref> [23] </ref> is a heuristic approach to graph drawing based on a physical system. This algorithm simulates a mechanical system in which a graph's edges are replaced by springs and nodes are replaced by rings connecting edges, or springs, incident on a node.

Reference-contexts: Among the parameters that control the forces acting on the rings and causing their movement are spring length, spring stiffness, spring type, and initial configuration. This a very general heuristic which can be combined with other algorithms <ref> [24] </ref> to provide approximate solutions for competing aesthetics. The spatial representations of the Document Explorer's networks are designed to facilitate users' perception of network structure.

Reference-contexts: As with any information service system, it is vitally important that the user formulate proper queries. In practice, a large portion of an application's effort can go into properly formulating the problem (asking the right question) rather than optimizing the algorithmic details of a particular data method <ref> [27] </ref>. We will use AI and visualization techniques in query refinement. Parallel search schemes are used to retrieve information. Search results are sorted and ranked, and presented to users through visualization tools. 2.2 System Architecture Properly servicing user information requests is at the core of the research.

Reference-contexts: One promising approach for enhancing information retrieval through the Internet is visualization to facilitate users' perception of document relation structure. A number of systems have been developed to provide visually based browsing mechanisms for traversing the link structure of Internet documents <ref> [49, 2, 40, 53] </ref>, typically in a three dimensional or distorted space. Unfortunatley, link connectivity shows relatively little about the topic relations among documents across the Internel. Systems which provide facilities for organizing and viewing document organizations based on semantic content are an alternative.

Reference-contexts: These issues include difficulties in query formulation such as use of indexing vocabularies, indexing indeterminacy, and users' inability to completely specify information needs <ref> [41] </ref>. Retrieving information that meets users' information needs is an iterative process, and techniques which explicitly incorporate users' judgments, such as relevance feedback [48], provide means to automate some aspects of user guided retrieval.

Reference-contexts: The spatial representations of the Document Explorer's networks are designed to facilitate users' perception of network structure. Network nodes are positioned in three dimensions using a graph layout algorithm [44] based on the spring metaphor which is similar to Kamada and Kawai's <ref> [42] </ref> two-dimensional network layout algorithm.

Subsequent generations of text search "robots" have been built on this humble foundation [63]. 15 Machine learning approaches (see Knoblock <ref> [43] </ref>) faced the problem of labeling the samples. Tech--niques such as uncertainty sampling [45] reduce the amount of labeled data needed, but do not eliminate the labeling problem. Clustering techniques do not require labeled inputs, and have been applied successfully to large collections of documents [15].

Reference-contexts: This a very general heuristic which can be combined with other algorithms [24] to provide approximate solutions for competing aesthetics. The spatial representations of the Document Explorer's networks are designed to facilitate users' perception of network structure. Network nodes are positioned in three dimensions using a graph layout algorithm <ref> [44] </ref> based on the spring metaphor which is similar to Kamada and Kawai's [42] two-dimensional network layout algorithm. As with other spring embedder algorithms, nodes are treated as connectors and spring length and strength among connectors is derived from network link distances.

Nonetheless, for certain restricted classes of graphs in which graph-theoretic expressions of aesthetic criteria can be specified, satisfactory algorithms have been developed <ref> [8, 46, 58] </ref>. Some of the aesthetics for drawings of general undirected graphs are symmetry, minimization of edge crossings and bends in edges, uniform edge lengths, and uniform node distribution. These aesthetics are such that optimality of one may prevent optimality in others.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Internet provides great opportunities, yet poses great challenges.

Reference-contexts: These issues include difficulties in query formulation such as use of indexing vocabularies, indexing indeterminacy, and users' inability to completely specify information needs [41]. Retrieving information that meets users' information needs is an iterative process, and techniques which explicitly incorporate users' judgments, such as relevance feedback <ref> [48] </ref>, provide means to automate some aspects of user guided retrieval. It is also clear that mechanisms providing alternative paths of access to information can enhance retrieval effectiveness [7]. One promising approach for enhancing information retrieval through the Internet is visualization to facilitate users' perception of document relation structure.

The indexing and ranking schemes will be different from what the MetaCrawler used. 6 Gis2Web Gis2Web <ref> [50] </ref> allows users to access GIS (Geographic Information System) data from the Web. Though most information available on the WWW is un-structured, GIS data has a very rigid internal structure because the GIS software that provides these data organizes these information in a data base structure. <p> With the recent wide-spread acceptance and availability of World Wide Web technology, it is natural to look toward building linkages between the two distinct worlds of GIS and the WWW in order to make the wealth of information available in the GIS world publicly available through the WWW. Gis2web <ref> [50] </ref> is such a system intended to bridge the gap between existing GIS software and the WWW. Gis2web accesses distributed datasets in different Arc/Info formats, converts the data to forms appropriate for WWW distribution, and provides access through a gis2web server.

Reference-contexts: The statistical text analyses rely on recovering conceptual information from natural language by considering the frequency and co-occurrence of words. This basic approach has been used in a wide range of contexts and its utility and limitations are well-known <ref> [59] </ref>. The visual environment for exploration and direct manipulation uses the same visual representation for query, associative thesaurus, and document content to facilitate query revision by direct manipulation of system objects. The representations underlying the visual displays are minimum cost networks derived from measures of term and document associations.

Reference-contexts: Harvest [13] is one of the pioneering and successful Internet information access and discovery systems. Harvest servers run on the client and index information in locally stored files. When a service is requested, the server reports the result through a pre-defined network interface. MetaCrawler <ref> [64] </ref> uses existing Internet search engines. It sends user requests to search engines such as Yahoo, Lycos and others. Results are analysed, filtered, ranked and sent back to users. MLDB [38] is designed for resource and knowledge discovery in global information systems using a multi-layered database approach. <p> Dynamic User Searchable Index Engine User-configurable indexing techniques [32] are sup plied which extend the hierarchical indexing schemes currently in widespread use. ParaCrawler ParaCrawler is a parallel search engine. The search scheme used will be very similar to that of MetaCrawler <ref> [64] </ref> where the user request is forwarded to various existing search engines. The results returned from these search engines are digested and presented to the user. <p> Coordinator: The main program of the gis2web coordinates all the activities among the different components. 5 ParaCrawler | Parallel Web Searching With Machine Learning ParaCralwer is a Web search engine that has combined search, indexing, and ranking capability. We will use a search mechanism similar to that of MetaCrawler <ref> [64] </ref>. ParaCrawler takes a user request then re-sends it to a number of well-known search services on the Internet in parallel by starting one process for each target search engine. Each of these processes is responsible for working with these pre-defined search engines. Each process will do the following. 1.

Reference-contexts: For some forms of retrieval this simple procedure suffers from the limitation that frequently occurring terms have relatively little value for discriminating among documents <ref> [65] </ref>. However, one function of the associative thesaurus is to give a picture of all of the concepts in a document set. The most frequently occurring terms tend to be general terms that provide useful information about the domain of the document collection.

Reference-contexts: For example, the display of symmetry and minimization of the number of edge crossings in two-dimensional drawings are fundamental aesthetics for visual presentations. Considering the wide application of graph structures in display, there are relatively few algorithms for drawing general undirected graphs <ref> [66] </ref>. This is due in part to the inability to specify the aesthetic criteria individuals use in understanding graphs [22]. Nonetheless, for certain restricted classes of graphs in which graph-theoretic expressions of aesthetic criteria can be specified, satisfactory algorithms have been developed [8, 46, 58].
