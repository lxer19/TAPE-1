Abstract: This paper presents techniques for interactively visualizing tensor fields using deformations. The conceptual idea behind this approach is to allow the tensor field to manifest its influence on idealized objects placed within the tensor field. This is similar, though not exactly the same, to surfaces deforming under load in order to relieve built up stress and strain. We illustrate the effectiveness of the Deviator-Isotropic tensor decomposition in deformation visualizations of CFD strain rate. We also investigate how directional flow techniques can be extended to distinguish between regions of tensile versus compressive forces.

While this class of methods draws the user's attention to the salient features in the field, the user still has to mentally reconstruct the rest of the field around these degenerate and critical points and skeletons.

Reference-contexts: This research presents intuitive, deformation-based tensor field visualization techniques to complement the limited set of current techniques. Deformation is an intuitive and effective method that has been used extensively to illustrate effects of tensile and compressive forces in mechanics textbooks <ref> [2] </ref>; can be observed directly in nature in the form of geological formations [23]; and alters the molecular alignment of liquid crystals and thus their light scattering capability in order to measure shear stress in compressible flow measurements [27].

Reference-contexts: In our second technique, we replace the usual surface normals on our surface with the derived resolute vectors. We then visualize the resolute vector field on the surface using directional flow visualization <ref> [25, 3] </ref> 2 . The resulting visualization highlights areas where the resolute vectors are closely aligned with the visualization light. By changing the direction of the light or surface normal we can quickly identify regions where the resolute vector is shear or normal to the surface (see Color Plate 3).

Hes-selink <ref> [8] </ref> provides a table of these common tensors and their calculation. <p> Since antisymmetric portion (A) is antisymmetric about the diagonal and the diagonal components are 0, it has only 3 independent components, 3 in either the upper triangu lar matrix or lower triangular matrix. This corresponds to a rotation vector that can be visualized as hedgehogs or ribbons <ref> [8] </ref> imposed on visualizations of the symmetric tensor. The symmetric part (S) has 6 independent components, 3 in either the upper or lower trian gular matrix plus 3 components on the diagonal. This multivariate data is more difficult to visualize.

Reference-contexts: While glyphs allow the possibility of displaying all the tensor information at a particular point, their principal drawbacks are the loss of continuity from the discrete nature and placement of glyphs, and the potential clutter and overlapping of the glyphs.

For symmetric tensor fields, the three orthogonal eigenvector components are sorted into largest, median, and smallest eigenvalues.

Reference-contexts: Directional information is displayed separately by elliptical glyphs placed over characteristic curves. Non-symmetric tensor fields are not supported. Geodesics This approach to visualizing symmetric tensor fields is to construct the geodesics in the Riemannian space determined by the tensor so that the induced curvature can be realized <ref> [10] </ref>. Essentially, this method relies on the construction of geodesic surfaces to show the effect of the tensor field as a distortion of flat space. Unfortunately, this method does not easily extend to non-symmetric tensor fields.

Reference-contexts: The Deviator is useful in our visu-alizations since it eliminates this constant multiple of the selected direction and emphasizes the structural detail in the field. Visualization To visualize the tensor field we place a geometric object, such as a plane, as an interrogation object <ref> [15] </ref> in the field. We use trilinear interpolation at discrete points on the surface to obtain tensors at each point. We then form the inner product of the tensors and a user selected vector or vector field (such as the normal to the surface).

Reference-contexts: More work needs to be done in this area to determine if antisymmetry is clearly visible using this technique, as well as investigating other techniques, such as 4D lights <ref> [16] </ref>, for this purpose. We have not investigated visualization using the Polar Decomposition. We believe that in the physical situations where the Polar Decomposition is permitted (the determinate of the original tensor must be 0), the Polar Decomposition will provide further clues about the behavior of the field.

Reference-contexts: We then apply these deformation based techniques to data sets from computational fluid dynamics. 2 PREVIOUS WORK Tensor fields can be found in numerous physics and engineering applications such as fluid flows [8], mechanics and material science [20], and tectonics <ref> [32] </ref>. In spite of their prevalence, tools to visualize and understand these data sets are quite limited. In this section, we review the current set of alternatives for visualizing tensor fields.
