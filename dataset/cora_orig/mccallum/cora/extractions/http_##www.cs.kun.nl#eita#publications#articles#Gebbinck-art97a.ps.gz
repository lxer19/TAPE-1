Abstract: Pixel-based classification is a standard approach towards crop area estimation, but it is unsuited to handle mixed pixels. Therefore, we developed the data-driven decomposition method, which combines the linear mixture model with knowledge of the application domain. A quantitative comparison proved that both concepts lead to more accurate estimates when processing simulated images. Experiments on a real Landsat-TM image showed that our method estimated the area of 13 out of 17 lots more accurately than a similar approach based on classification. These results suggest that data-driven decomposition is a more accurate method to estimate the area of an agricultural field.

Reference-contexts: In addition to these simple pixel-based methods, several authors have suggested to use the spatial relationships between the image pixels to locate agricultural fields for subsequent classification on a field basis <ref> (e.g. Janssen 1994, Schoenmakers 1995) </ref>. Although this use of domain knowledge offers some improvement over pixel-based classification, it remains unsuited to handle mixed pixels. The data-driven decomposition method we propose combines the advantages of the decomposition approach and field-based classification. <p> Since we know that our scenes are a collection of agricultural fields, we can discriminate between pure and mixed pixels by locating the pure pixel clusters. These clusters can sometimes be found with the help of ancillary information sources such as topographical maps <ref> (Janssen 1994) </ref>, but it is also possible to segment the image using standard image processing techniques. <p> Once the pure pixels belonging to a cluster have been identified, they can be classified either on an individual basis or by some field-based approach that is more accurate <ref> (Janssen 1994) </ref>. Most remaining pixels are 4 probably mixed and should be decomposed rather than classified. Thus, the accuracy of an crop area estimate can be increased by making a segmentation of the image in order to classify the pure pixels and decompose the mixed pixels.

Reference-contexts: Based on these two experiments, a quantitative evaluation of the performance of data-driven decomposition could be made, leading to the conclusions presented in Section 5. 2 Data-driven decomposition Data-driven decomposition <ref> (Klein Gebbinck and Schouten 1996a) </ref> attempts to make an accurate estimation of the area of an agricultural field based on two ideas. The first thought is that pixels that are mixed should be split into their composing parts.

Reference-contexts: Since field-based classification found many boundary structures composed of asphalt where, according to the map, canals, ditches, or tree rows were situated, the occurrence of spectral confusion was evident <ref> (Klein Gebbinck and Schouten 1996b) </ref>. The third source of error, which was caused by the difficulty to distinguish ordinary from isolated mixed pixels, was once more impossible to verify due to the nature of the supervised information. <p> Although the estimated composition of the narrow boundary structures agreed with the map much better than the estimates by field-based classification, data-driven decomposition did experience some problems with structures composed of water in particular <ref> (Klein Gebbinck and Schouten 1996b) </ref>. To determine whether there were any other sources of error, we investigated lots 1, 8, and 9 to find out why the decomposition approach gave less accurate results than the classification method.

Reference-contexts: A number of decomposition methods that assume a non-linear mixture model have also been suggested <ref> (e.g. Marsh et al. 1980, Foody and Cox 1994, Carlotto 1995) </ref>, but they all lacked the sensible physical basis of the linear mixture model, and none of them was followed up to any great degree.

Reference-contexts: Since the accuracy of the area estimator depends on the quality of the segmentation, and an investigation into optimal segmentation methods was considered to be beyond the scope of our present study <ref> (but see Schouten and Klein Gebbinck 1995) </ref>, we decided to use the perfect segmentation, which could easily be derived while simulating the image. This way, the performance of data-driven decomposition could be evaluated without being affected by a possibly bad choice for a segmentation method.

Reference-contexts: This dependency is linear as long as the amount of multiple scattering between the different crop types is negligible, i.e. each photon reaching the sensor has interacted with only one cover type <ref> (Settle and Drake 1993) </ref>.

The values are given in pixel area units. one more than the true dimensionality of the data <ref> (Settle and Drake 1993) </ref>. Figure 1 shows the resulting image together with the positions of the mixed pixels. This image was processed by each of the four crop area estimators, whose performance is presented in Table 1.
