Abstract: This paper concerns the probabilistic evaluation of the effects of actions in the presence of unmeasured variables. We show that the identification of causal effect between a singleton variable X and a set of variables Y can be accomplished systematically, in time polynomial in the number of variables in the graph. When the causal effect is identifiable, a closed-form expression can be obtained for the probability that the action will achieve a specified goal, or a set of goals.

Reference-contexts: Fortunately, certain causal effects are identifiable even in situations where members of pa j are be unobservable, and these situations can be recognized through the action calculus introduced in <ref> [Pearl, 1994a] </ref>. Let X; Y; and Z be arbitrary disjoint sets of nodes in a DAG G. We say that X and Y are independent given Z in G, denoted (X k Y jZ) G , if the set Z d-separates X from Y in G. <p> Details of this construction are not shown explicitly in the paper, but can be found in <ref> [Pearl, 1994a, Pearl, 1994b] </ref>. In view of this construction, we now have a polynomial-time method of assessing the ramification of actions, given a qualitative causal diagram together with a probability distribution on a set of observed variables. <p> If the learner is permitted to act as well as observe, the task becomes much easier of course, because the topology of the diagram can also be inferred, at least partially. Immediate applications to cause effect analysis of nonexperimental data in the social and medical sciences are discussed in <ref> [Pearl, 1994a] </ref>. 7 Appendix The conditions which license each of the rules of Theorem 1 are the tightest possible : (Y k ZjX; W ) G X if P (yj^x; z; w) = P (yj^x; z) Since the d-separation condition is valid for any recursive model, including the submodel represented by

Reference-contexts: In [Spirtes et al] for example, it was shown how causal networks can be used to facilitate quantitative predictions of the effects of interventions, including interventions that were not contemplated during the network's construction. 2 A previous UAI paper <ref> [Pearl, 1994b] </ref> reviews this aspect of causal networks, and proposes a calculus for deriving probabilistic assessments of the effects of actions in the presence of unmeasured variables. <p> Details of this construction are not shown explicitly in the paper, but can be found in <ref> [Pearl, 1994a, Pearl, 1994b] </ref>.
