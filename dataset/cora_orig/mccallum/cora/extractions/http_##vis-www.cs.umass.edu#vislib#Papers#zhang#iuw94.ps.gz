Abstract: Three different algorithms for qualitative obstacle detection are presented in this paper. Each one is based on different assumptions. The first two algorithms are aimed at yes/no obstacle detection without indicating which points are obstacles. They have the advantage of fast determination of the existence of obstacles in a scene based on the solvability of a linear system. The first algorithm uses information about the ground plane, while the second algorithm only assumes that the ground is planar. The third algorithm continuously estimates the ground plane, and based on that determines the height of each matched point in the scene. Experimental results are presented for real and simulated data, and performances of the three algorithms under different noise levels are compared in simulation. We conclude that in terms of the robustness of performance, the third one works best.

Reference-contexts: This paper shows that it is possible to recover partial metric information from partial calibration, where the depth of the second camera is known in the frame of the first camera. More detailed information on these algorithms appears in <ref> [9] </ref>. Speed is also an important issue for obstacle detection. The first two algorithms listed above only require one image to be processed at each time step. The tradeoff is that one processes fewer images to detect obstacles, but the algo-rithms only give a yes/no answer. <p> relationship between the 3D point P and its corresponding 2D image point p, together with the ground plane equation, produces the following matrix equation of the flow of point p: _p = HM (2) where H is a function of ground plane equation coefficients and the image point p (see <ref> [9] </ref> for the detailed derivation). <p> DM = b (3) where D = (H 1 ; :::; H n ) T and b = ( _p 1 ; :::; _p n ) T . It can be shown <ref> [9] </ref> that the following proposition holds: Proposition: The n points are all ground plane points iff the linear system Eq.3 has a solution; that is, iff Rank (D) = Rank (Db). <p> A feasible criterion for determining if Rank (D) = Rank (Db) is to check if the ratio min (D) is sufficiently large. Based on our simulation analysis under different noise levels, and our experimental results on real images <ref> [9] </ref>, a threshold ffi between 5 to 10 on this ratio value is sufficient to detect obstacle points 1 ft. or more off the ground plane. Since the dis-cretization error is not being modeled, this does not depend on the distance to the obstacle. UGP works in a similar way. <p> )R + tn T ]p i (6) where h c is the height of the left camera above the reference plane, h i is the distance of the 3D point P i above the reference plane, and k i 0 scale factor corresponding to p i () p i 0 <ref> [9] </ref>. We define the state vector S to be the vector consisting of the eight variable elements of the matrix A. Note that this vector combines information about the ground plane and the transformation between cameras. <p> R = (R 1 ; R 2 ; R 3 ) T , and t = (t X ; t Y ; t Z ) T .

Hills at large scales can be accommodated by weighting previous estimates so that the Kalman Filter only accumulates its history from the last n frames.
