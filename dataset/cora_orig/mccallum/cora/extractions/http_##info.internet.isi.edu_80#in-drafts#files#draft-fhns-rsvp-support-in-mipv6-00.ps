Abstract: We discuss several solutions to this problem: (1) By modifying RSVP at mobile and correspondent nodes to become aware of MIPv6 addressing, we provide a simple repair that allows RSVP flows to be established between the fixed network and mobiles; (2a) By adding optional objects to RSVP messages, a performance enhancement is proposed to make handovers smooth and seamless; (2b) A different technique with the same goal is called flow extension and it provides flows with fixed flow-ids from the correspondent node into the wireless access network at the expense of forwarding traffic inside the access network, whenever the mobile node moves. We conclude that the minimal solution (1) is a requirement in order to make MIPv6 and RSVP interoperable; our favored approach requires only minor changes to the correspondent and mobile node's RSVP and MIP specification. However, for well performing and uninterrupted operation we strongly recommend one of the solutions (2a or 2b) that support fast re-establishment or preservation of resource reservations when mobile nodes move.

Reference-contexts: Thus commonality with MIPv4 - RSVP integration in terms of the use of RSVP tunneling is true for both approaches. 3.4 IPSOFACTO: IP Multicast over Wireless ATM <ref> [1] </ref> describes how IP multicast can be natively supported in wireless networks over ipso-facto. To differentiate different types of traffic VCs are classified as unicast, multicast and broadcast VCs. Small extensions to the IGMP protocol are proposed.

Reference-contexts: Some multicast routing protocols such as DVMRP [18] and MOSPF [10] build a multicast tree per source. These routing protocols construct the multicast tree depending on the source address as well as the destination address. Other algorithms like CBT <ref> [5] </ref> build a single shared tree per group. These protocols use only the IP destination address for packet forwarding.

Reference-contexts: However MIPv4 may also use this technique [13]. Although RSVP is standardised [7] it currently looks like it is going to be employed for access networks but not necessarily for end-to-end connections through the backbone networks. Solutions for bridging RSVP across the backbone are under development <ref> [6] </ref> and are being discussed in the IETF intserv and diffserv working groups.

Reference-contexts: We apply our considerations to MIPv6 because it uses route optimisation by default. However MIPv4 may also use this technique [13].

Reference-contexts: The MN is then capable of receiving datagrams destined to its current IP address as well as the previous IP address. For best effort traffic destined to the MN, the previous IP address should be used. This packet forwarding technique is an enhancement to support loss-less handovers <ref> [8] </ref>. Prior to or during the relocation of the terminal, the old MIP-router also extends the existing RSVP flows to the new MIP-router. This task is performed by a mobility management (MM) entity operating within the router. <p> This elongation of data paths has been adopted in Wireless ATM technology for the handling of connections (VCs) during the occurrence of handovers. Relevant information can be found in [2], [3], <ref> [8] </ref>. 2.2.1 Required or Optional Changes Due to the flow extension approach modifications are confined to the end-nodes and mobile/wireless access network routers. <p> This work is also described in [14]. In this report, in addition to the overall design of the wireless broadband IP system, some of the MIP/RSVP integration problems are described in greater detail, including diagrams and message sequence charts. 3.6 Mobility Management in an IP-based Wireless ATM Network In <ref> [8] </ref>, Hadjiefthymiades et al. studied mobility management issues in a WATM architecture exclusively intended and optimised for IP traffic support. The considered system is a variation of the Magic WAND architecture. It is capable of supporting IP applications with specific QoS requirements in light of terminal mobility.

Reference-contexts: We assume here the usage of RSVP for wireless and fixed access networks and its transparent operation over the backbone. 1.1 Terms This draft uses the terms as defined in section Mobile IPv6 Terms in the Internet Draft Mobility Support in IPv6 <ref> [9] </ref>. 1.2 Problem statement 1.2.1 The Unicast Case An integral part of MIPv6 is the use of optimised paths between a mobile node and correspondent nodes. Routing of packets via the Home Agent is typically only a transient phase in MIPv6. <p> traffic (uplink direction), we always pass by the RSVP tunnel to reach the old MIP-router. 3 Previous Work This section summarises selected recent research on providing QoS support in mobile and wireless networks and serves as a starting point for further reading. 3.1 Mobile IP Version 6 The description MIPv6 <ref> [9] </ref> encompasses a streamlined version of Mobile IP that makes use of new IPv6 features that help to improve mobility support. Most notable, foreign agents could be replaced by stateless address autoconfiguration and neighbor discovery. As stated earlier, optimised routes between CN and MN are the default operation in MIPv6.

Reference-contexts: Now, we consider the case where the MN sends multicast data. IP unicast routing protocols depend only on the IP destination address. Some multicast routing protocols such as DVMRP [18] and MOSPF <ref> [10] </ref> build a multicast tree per source. These routing protocols construct the multicast tree depending on the source address as well as the destination address. Other algorithms like CBT [5] build a single shared tree per group.

Reference-contexts: Handovers involving more than one MIP routers (intersubnet handovers), necessitate the use of resource and mobility management schemes. The paper identifies the problems encountered in MIP-RSVP interaction and presents some initial thoughts for their resolution. 3.7 Wireless Multicasting in an IP Environment <ref> [11] </ref> describes a framework for multicast communication in a wireless IP environment. It presents a group membership management mechanism optimised for wireless networks.

Reference-contexts: Devices used include mobile phones, PDAs, and notebook computers. Mobile IP could become a common platform for mobile access (regardless of the underlying access technology), providing solutions to the many security, routing, and addressing problems. For a good introduction to Mobile IP see <ref> [12] </ref>. More traditional services like telephony, radio and TV broadcasting, and other new Internet applications that require more than best-effort service are increasingly being carried on the Internet. Mobile users also want to enjoy multimedia and other realtime services. <p> RSVP aware and swap the home address in the PATH and RESV messages SESSION objects with the mobile nodes care-of address (among other fields, see Section A for details). 1 It is current practice of MIPv4 implementors to use the routing table to store the MN's location at home agents <ref> [12] </ref>. If MIPv6 would use the same technique consistently, a simple routing socket lookup (PF ROUTE) would reveal the care-of address when fed with the home address of the MN. 4 We recommend here the implementation of a clean interface in MIPv6 which must be used by the RSVP daemon.

Reference-contexts: This draft focuses on issues of MIPv6 and RSVP interoperability, more precisely on the operation phase where optimised routing between fixed and mobile hosts is used. We apply our considerations to MIPv6 because it uses route optimisation by default. However MIPv4 may also use this technique <ref> [13] </ref>. Although RSVP is standardised [7] it currently looks like it is going to be employed for access networks but not necessarily for end-to-end connections through the backbone networks.

Reference-contexts: The objective of this system is to allow full exploitation of real-time IP applications in a mobile environment. This system comprises a mobile node, access point (implementing all radio dependent control functionality) and a mobility enhanced IPv6 router. This work is also described in <ref> [14] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Most notable, foreign agents could be replaced by stateless address autoconfiguration and neighbor discovery. As stated earlier, optimised routes between CN and MN are the default operation in MIPv6. They can be implemented properly by using IPv6 routing headers. 3.2 Mobile RSVP (MRSVP) MRSVP has been proposed in <ref> [15] </ref>, as an extension to conventional RSVP, for the provision of QoS guarantees to MNs independently of their movement throughout the access network. MRSVP suggests making the required resource reservations in all the locations expected to be visited by the MN (mobility specification). MRSVP supports two service classes.

Reference-contexts: RSVP operation over IP tunnels <ref> [16] </ref> provides a good basis for the implementation of the proposed scheme (see also Section 3.3). The old MIP-router uses regular IP tunnels for forwarding best effort traffic and RSVP tunnels for handling the extension of RSVP flows. <p> When the MN roams, passive reservations are switched to active and vice versa. The MRSVP scheme provides mobility support for both unicast and multicast traffic. 3.3 Supporting RSVP/MIP Integration with RSVP-Tunnels RSVP tunnels <ref> [16] </ref> provide signalling of RSVP messages in tunnels. Normally, RSVP messages in tunnels are not visible to routers due to encapsulation.

Reference-contexts: It was shown that consecutive elongations (leading to increased sub-optimality) will be needed rarely, as the number of inter-subnet MN relocations (i.e., handovers to subnetworks controlled by different MIP-routers; and hence changes in addresses) is very small during the lifetime of IP connections in a CPN environment <ref> [17] </ref>. Most relocations will result in attachments of the MN to base stations (radio transceivers) in the same subnetwork (also termed intra-subnet handovers).

Reference-contexts: The process of leaving and re-joining the multicast groups can be done as part of the handover procedure. Now, we consider the case where the MN sends multicast data. IP unicast routing protocols depend only on the IP destination address. Some multicast routing protocols such as DVMRP <ref> [18] </ref> and MOSPF [10] build a multicast tree per source. These routing protocols construct the multicast tree depending on the source address as well as the destination address. Other algorithms like CBT [5] build a single shared tree per group.
