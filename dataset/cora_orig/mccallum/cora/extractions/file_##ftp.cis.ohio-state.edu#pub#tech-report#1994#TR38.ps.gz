Abstract: This paper addresses the issues related to the delivery of multimedia traffic on local area networks. Multimedia integrates voice and video along with text and images into existing systems. Traditional local area networks, e.g., Ethernet, were designed to handle regular data traffic which are bursty in nature and for which variable delay is acceptable. Multimedia traffic, on the other hand, requires a constant delay in addition to fast (or real time) delivery. Multimedia traffic also requires a large amount of bandwidth compared to regular traffic. Multimedia is becoming important in commercial as well as non-commercial organizations and Ethernet is a widely used local area network among most of these organizations; therefore, modification of Ethernet protocols to integrate multimedia streams is an important issue. In this paper, we present solutions to the problems associated with transfer of multimedia data on Ethernet and qualitatively study the performance of these solutions and their suitability to multimedia traffic. Specifically, priority protocols are developed that enable priority transmission of data on Ethernets. Multimedia data can be assigned priority over regular data, and the developed priority protocols can be used to deliver multimedia data over the Ethernet in a timely manner.

Reference-contexts: ATM switches and interfaces will be needed which would add a lot of cost to these organizations. Therefore, a practical solution is to add capabilities to the existing LANs in order to successfully transmit multimedia streams. 2 State of the Art The ISO Reference Model of Open System Interconnection <ref> [11] </ref> (also known as the ISO 7-layer reference), divides communication into seven different conceptual layers. The highest is the Application Layer, where different programs or applications communicate with each other. The lowest level is the Physical Layer, which is concerned with the actual physical data transmission and the hardware involved.

Reference-contexts: Ethernet communication falls in this layer. Internet Protocol (IP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), as well as most other protocols involved in interpro-cess communication, represent higher level protocols. When several networks are connected together, IP provides point-to-point delivery of packets <ref> [12] </ref>. IP addresses are divided into two parts, the network address and the host address. In theory, a maximum of 254 hosts can be attached to a single Ethernet. However, in practice, the number of hosts is much smaller.

Reference-contexts: In theory, a maximum of 254 hosts can be attached to a single Ethernet. However, in practice, the number of hosts is much smaller. Ethernets are a baseband bus communication medium that use CSMA/CD (carrier sense multiple access/collision detect) <ref> [13] </ref>. CSMA essentially means that a node will listen to the channel before it attempts to transmit, to avoid transmitting while another node is transmitting. If a node finds the channel is currently busy, it waits until the Ethernet becomes free and then begins transmitting. <p> This paradigm attempts to give all nodes an equal chance to transmit their data, while avoiding subsequent collisions due to repeated retransmission attempts <ref> [13, 14] </ref>. There is no notion of priority at this level. Thus, transmission of multimedia data on an Ethernet does not get any preference and must compete equally with the transmission of regular data traffic. Ethernet hardware, i.e., network interface, is designed to minimize the load on the CPU.

Reference-contexts: Broadcast packets are received by all nodes on an Ethernet, but are not propagated to adjoining Ethernets when the system consists of multiple interconnected Ethernets. The network interface can be configured to be in "promis cuous mode" in which it receives all packets sent on the bus <ref> [15] </ref>. However, this is likely to cause an unacceptable load on the CPU to process and discard all of the undesired packets. Thus, Ethernet is designed to efficiently transfer regular data traffic which is bursty in nature and for which variable delay is acceptable (e.g., transaction processing).
