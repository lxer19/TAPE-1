Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Networks of Workstations (NOW) are becoming increasingly popular for providing cost-effective and affordable parallel computing for day-to-day computational needs <ref> [1, 31] </ref>. Such environments consist of clusters of workstations connected by Local Area Networks (LANs). Hardware and software LAN technology was not initially developed for parallel processing, and thus the communication overhead between workstations can be quite high.

Reference-contexts: However, most of these research projects focus on homogeneous NOW systems where similar kinds of workstations (nodes) are connected over a single network architecture. Some popular network architectures used in the current NOW environments are Ethernet, ATM <ref> [2] </ref>, Myrinet [4], FDDI, Cut-through switches like SP-2 [30], and Fiber-Channel. Due to the commodity nature of workstations and networking equipment, LAN environments are gradually becoming heterogeneous. <p> Thus, algorithms for collective communication need to take care of these characteristics to achieve reduced latency. Communication protocols: Current generation LANs typically support different communication protocols (such as TCP/IP, ATM <ref> [2] </ref>, and FM [25]) which workstations (nodes) use to communicate. These protocols have their own characteristics and affect the latency of communication operations. Furthermore, some nodes may have access to more than one set of protocols.

Reference-contexts: The need for collective communication operations such as broadcast, multicast, global reduction, scatter, gather, complete exchange, and barrier synchronization arises frequently in parallel applications <ref> [27, 5, 3, 10, 19, 22, 15] </ref>. Thus, it is critical that the collective communication operations be implemented in the best possible manner (scalable as well as high performance) in a HNOW system. Recently, some projects have emphasized issues related to collective communication in NOW systems.
