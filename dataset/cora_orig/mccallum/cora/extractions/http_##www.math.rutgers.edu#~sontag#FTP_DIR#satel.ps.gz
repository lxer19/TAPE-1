Abstract: We prove that the angular velocity equations can be smoothly stabilized with a single torque controller for bodies having an axis of symmetry. This complements a recent result of Aeyels and Szafranski.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we show that there exists a nonlinear control law which achieves asymptotic stabilizability. The existence of smooth feedback controllers has been recently linked to the construction of coprime right factorizations; see [5]. To make this note more self-contained, we remind the reader of the framework in <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> We assume that T i 6= 0; i = 1; 2; 3: (2) (See the paper <ref> [1] </ref> for a study of what may happen when some of the components of T vanish.) The controls u () are allowed to take arbitrary real values. The matrix S (x) is the rotation matrix S (x) = @ x 3 0 x 1 1 In [1] it is claimed that <p> (2) (See the paper <ref> [1] </ref> for a study of what may happen when some of the components of T vanish.) The controls u () are allowed to take arbitrary real values. The matrix S (x) is the rotation matrix S (x) = @ x 3 0 x 1 1 In [1] it is claimed that the control law u = T 0 x stabilizes the system (1). However, this is false if some I i = I j ; i 6= j. (The gap is in the sentence "a simple calculation shows that..." in page 36. <p> The system (3)-(5) is smoothly stabilizable. Note that it will never be possible to find a linear k as in <ref> [1] </ref>, even if only local stabilization is required. This is because in that case there would exist states x arbitrarily close to the origin of the form (x 1 ; x 2 ; 0); x 2 2 6= 0 for which k (x) = 0. <p> We first obtain a smooth u () : W 0 ! IR such that 1. u (x) &gt; 0 and for all x 6= 0 and each such that 0 1. Then we shall show that there exists a smooth : IR ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> such that (x) &gt; 0 for x 2 W 0 , (0)u (0) = 0, and u is smooth on all of W. This, together with (1) and (2) above, will imply that k := u is as desired. <p> Fix R &gt; 0 such that fx : kxk Rg W, and let N be an integer such that N R &gt; 1. For j N , let A j be the compact annulus fx; 1=j kxk Rg, and let j : IR ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> be a smooth function such that j (x) &gt; 0 if and only if 1=j &lt; kxk &lt; R. Then the support of j is precisely A j . Let v j = j u, so v j is a compactly supported smooth function on IR. <p> Hence 0 u is smooth on IR. Further, 0 u vanishes at the origin because each term does. To conclude the proof, take a smooth function 1 : IR ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> such that 1 (x) &gt; 0 whenever kxk R, and 1 vanishes on a neighborhood of the origin. Then let = 1 2 ( 0 + 1 ). It is clear that satisfies all the desired conditions.

Reference-contexts: This establishes the claim. We now want to perturb the feedback k in order to make it everywhere positive, as needed for the Proposition. By standard inverse Lyapunov theorems (see for instance Theorem 14 in <ref> [4] </ref>,) we know that there is a strong Lyapunov function for the system _x = f 0 (x) + k (x)f 1 (x) ; (18) that is, there is a weak Lyapunov function which satisfies also the strict inequality L f 0 +kf 1 V (x) &lt; 0 (19) for all
