Abstract: Priority Encoding Transmission (PET) is an encoding scheme which provides multiple levels of redundancy in order to protect the different contents of a data set according to their importance. The task of optimally assigning redundancies for the PET encoding scheme is investigated for the special case of MPEG-1 encoded video sequences. The prerequisites for this optimization problem and the way of proceeding for its solution are outlined and several suggestions for further improvements are given.

Reference-contexts: A major goal of priority encoding transmission (PET) is to provide graceful degradation for MPEG-1 encoded video streams in order to allow users with different HW-equipment to share the same applications <ref> [1] </ref>. To this end PET protects the different contents of an MPEG-1 video according to their importance via a multilevel redundancy scheme and information spreading.

Reference-contexts: This standard, the development of which was primarily driven by the rapidly expanding CDROM-Video market, is often called MPEG but should be called more accurately MPEG-1 as there is a second proposal, MPEG-2 <ref> [2] </ref>, which addresses digital television and is still under scrutiny. An MPEG-1-video is represented by a layered bistream as being described in [3]. The top layer is called a sequence which is encapsulated by the sequence delimiters header and trailer. <p> In every GOP there is one Iframe which immediately follows the GOP header if the GOP is viewed in bitstream order (further details concerning bitstream and display order are described in <ref> [2] </ref>). Due to the perceptive properties of the human visual system the luminance component is sampled with more spatial accuracy than the chrominance components. Each chrominance 2 component, chrominance red and chrominance blue, has one-half the vertical and horizontal resolution of the luminance component. <p> This makes the B-frames the least critical of the three frame types. Errors in I and P-frames propagate until the end of the GOP if the GOP has its "closed GOP"-flag set <ref> [2] </ref>. If the flag is not set the error in a P-frame can even propagate into the next GOP, and an error in the Iframe might affect B-frames in the previous GOP. 3 Fig.2: Block Transfer Encoding, the basis of JPEG and MPEG encoding.

Reference-contexts: An MPEG-1-video is represented by a layered bistream as being described in <ref> [3] </ref>. The top layer is called a sequence which is encapsulated by the sequence delimiters header and trailer. The sequence header contains information such as picture size, picture rate and bit rate. The trailer consists of a 32bit end code. <p> The main idea in PET is to assign a certain amount of redundancy to a GOP with the redundancy being unevenly distributed 5 among the different frame types, according to their importance <ref> [3] </ref>, [8]. Most probably it is advantageous not to restrict the redundancy assignment just to the level of frame types if graceful degradation is the overall goal. <p> At present PET is implemented in two versions with version 1 being based on the encoding of information via polynomials over Galois Fields <ref> [3] </ref>, [8] and version 2 being based on encoding of information via Cauchy matrices [8].

Reference-contexts: Iframes, which are self contained and can be decoded independently, are basically encoded like JPEG pictures as illustrated in Fig. 2. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group and also defines an international digital image compression standard for continuous-tone (multilevel) still images <ref> [4] </ref>. In every GOP there is one Iframe which immediately follows the GOP header if the GOP is viewed in bitstream order (further details concerning bitstream and display order are described in [2]).

Reference-contexts: The sizes of P- and B-frames can vary even within a GOP. In addition the MPEG-1 standard allows the pattern of I, P- and B-frames to vary dynamically between different GOPs although this is usually not done <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> This, however, doesn't have any major impact, especially if there are only two B-frames between P-frames which often is the case <ref> [5] </ref>. There is probably no way around partial decoding of MPEG-1 and splitting the information in an appropriate way. A suggestion is illustrated in Fig. 16. <p> A suggestion is illustrated in Fig. 16. The idea behind an enhanced PET scheme as indicated in Fig. 16 is to exploit the knowledge of the human visual system which is already available. Several facts might be important <ref> [5] </ref>: 1) The human visual system perceives 20 frames per second as smooth motion. 2) Perception is more sensitive to low frequencies which correspond to larger homogeneous areas in a picture. 3) Perception is more sensitive to changes in luminance and along the blue-orange axis than to changes in chrominance and

Reference-contexts: The main idea in PET is to assign a certain amount of redundancy to a GOP with the redundancy being unevenly distributed 5 among the different frame types, according to their importance [3], <ref> [8] </ref>. Most probably it is advantageous not to restrict the redundancy assignment just to the level of frame types if graceful degradation is the overall goal. <p> At present PET is implemented in two versions with version 1 being based on the encoding of information via polynomials over Galois Fields [3], <ref> [8] </ref> and version 2 being based on encoding of information via Cauchy matrices [8]. <p> At present PET is implemented in two versions with version 1 being based on the encoding of information via polynomials over Galois Fields [3], <ref> [8] </ref> and version 2 being based on encoding of information via Cauchy matrices [8]. Only version 2 will be regarded as this method allows faster encoding and decoding speeds and yields improved information recovery properties. 3.1 A simplified view of PET Only those issues of the PET scheme will be described that are crucial for the decision process of optimally assigning priorities. <p> The x k will also be referred to as the PET parameters which shall be chosen optimally to get the best possible video quality. With the above definitions it can be shown <ref> [8] </ref> that the following equations hold: N x x x i p b and N N N N r = + + + ( ) ( )1 (2) with r denoting the overall redundancy factor that is spent in the encoding process.

Reference-contexts: Note that this is only an approximation as with changing redundancy r either the packet size or the number of packets must change. Henceforth the packet loss distribution must change (which, however, hasn't been taken into account here). The optimization has been performed by Differential Evolution <ref> [9] </ref>. Although the local minima being discernible in the objective function surfaces in Figs. 10 -13 don't seem very challenging to an optimization program it has been found that a global optimization procedure is required to escape the traps being set up by the multiple plateaus and tiny local minima. <p> Although this experimental method appears to be outdated in a computerized world it is an effective way to directly involve the human visual system in the optimization process and to circumvent the mathematical modeling of an objective function. DE has been shown to converge smoothly and relatively fast <ref> [9] </ref>. Therefore it can be assumed that each new experiment yields further results and is not a waste of time due to stagnation behaviour of the optimization algorithm. The optimization can be stopped if no perceivable improvement is visible any more.

Reference-contexts: A possible way to escape the contrivance of a mathematical objective function at all is to use the human being directly as an "objective function gauge". An optimization method which allows for this idea is Experimental Differential Evolution (Experimental DE) as being suggested in <ref> [10] </ref>. The principal idea is illustrated in Fig. 15.
