Title: Expressive Power and Complexity in Algebraic Logic  
Author: Robin Hirsch 
Date: March 18, 1997  
Abstract: Two complexity problems in algebraic logic are surveyed: the satisfaction problem and the network satisfaction problem. Various complexity results are collected here and some new ones are derived. Many examples are given. The network satisfaction problem for most cylindric algebras of dimension four or more is shown to be intractable. Complexity is tied-in with the expressivity of a relation algebra. Expressivity and complexity are analysed in the context of homogeneous representations. The model-theoretic notion of interpretation is used to generalise known complexity results to a range of other algebraic logics. In particular a number of relation algebras are shown to have intractable network satisfaction problems.

Reference-contexts: The Left Linear Point Algebra The left linear point algebra was first presented in [Com83], where it is referred to as N 1 . A concrete representation of it appeared in [D 91], see also <ref> [AGN94] </ref>, page 642. A left-linear structure (L; &lt;) is a partial order such that if s; t; u 2 L and s; t &lt; u then either s &lt; t; t &lt; s or s = t. <p> This is impossible. Thus, a representation of L can never be 3-transitive, and hence can't be homogeneous. However L does have a 2-transitive, countable representation X. A construction of this representation can be found in <ref> [AGN94, pages 640-642] </ref> together with a reference to an earlier construction [D 91], pages 12-13. Formally, the domain of the representation X is Q fl = n2 (Nn0) ( n Q). Let f 2 n+1 Q and g 2 m+1 Q. <p> Many of the definitions and some of the results in this section are taken from Hodges' book and made appropriate here for algebraic logic. Interpretations have been used very successfully before with relation algebras. For example in <ref> [AGN94] </ref> representable relation algebras are interpreted in semi-groups to prove that the equational theory of various classes of relation algebras is undecidable.

Reference-contexts: Equivalently the problem is to say whether T A [ fOEg is consistent or not. The time complexity and space complexity of such problems are defined in any textbook on complexity e.g. <ref> [AHU74, vL94] </ref>. The network satisfaction problem (NSP) is a restriction of the satisfaction problem. Here, the problem is to decide whether an L (A)-sentence of the form 9xOE N (x) (for some A-network N ) holds in some representation of A.

Reference-contexts: Given that the relation algebra is finite, the existence of a transitively closed labeling is a necessary, but not always sufficient, condition for the satisfiability of N (see the pentagonal algebra, section 3.2 for a case where not all transitively closed atomic networks are satisfiable. See <ref> [HH97a] </ref> for an analysis of what happens in the infinite case). * Let k be a natural number. A network N is called k-consistent if for each subnetwork M of N with less than k nodes there is a transitively closed labeling of M .

Reference-contexts: Every relation algebra can be decomposed as a subdirect product of simple relation algebras (called the components) and the relation algebra is representable if and only if all the simple components are representable <ref> [JT48] </ref>. For a simple relation algebra, every representation is a disjoint union of square representations and thus a simple, representable relation algebra always has a square representation. In this paper, unless otherwise stated, we assume that all relation algebras are simple and that all representations are square.

Reference-contexts: The proof of theorem 21 shows that this problem reduces to the NSP over P and hence has polynomial complexity. (In fact it has cubic complexity). However, research of <ref> [NB94, Lig94] </ref> shows that a very much larger set of Allen relations can be used to label networks while preserving tractability. In a separate paper we aim to investigate Ligozat's concept of preconvexity to generalise this work to cover relation algebras not based on a linear order. <p> March 18, 1997 38 Of course for many interesting algebras the complexity is rather high. The problem of isolating tractable fragments of intractable algebras has been investigated for the particular case of the Allen interval algebra in <ref> [NB94, Lig94] </ref>, but a general method needs to be found. Another approach to handling intractable algebras is to look for approximate solutions to the network satisfaction problem.

Suppose that (o; @) is a one dimensional translation of C in I. It is a theorem of <ref> [LM94] </ref> that I has only one countable representation, up to base-isomorphism, and we will see (corollary 18) that this is homogeneous.

Let A be any relation algebra, and let L = L (A) be the first-order language with one binary predicate symbol for each element of A. We use the same symbol for an element of A as for the corresponding binary predicate in L (A). <p> of composition in L and the definition of a representation, that a network with nodes a; b; c; d with d &lt; c; d &lt; b; d]a; c]b (below) must embed in any representation of L. 3 The integral relation algebras possessing 1-transitive representations are called permutational relation algebras in <ref> [McK66] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: If X (1) = D fi D then call (X; D) a square representation. Lyndon's result shows that not every relation algebra is representable. It has been shown <ref> [Mon64] </ref> that no finite set of axioms can be sound and complete over PRA. Let (X; D); (Y; E) be representations of a relation algebra A.

Reference-contexts: The proof of theorem 21 shows that this problem reduces to the NSP over P and hence has polynomial complexity. (In fact it has cubic complexity). However, research of <ref> [NB94, Lig94] </ref> shows that a very much larger set of Allen relations can be used to label networks while preserving tractability. In a separate paper we aim to investigate Ligozat's concept of preconvexity to generalise this work to cover relation algebras not based on a linear order. <p> March 18, 1997 38 Of course for many interesting algebras the complexity is rather high. The problem of isolating tractable fragments of intractable algebras has been investigated for the particular case of the Allen interval algebra in <ref> [NB94, Lig94] </ref>, but a general method needs to be found. Another approach to handling intractable algebras is to look for approximate solutions to the network satisfaction problem.

Reference-contexts: Each of these has had wide application in temporal reasoning, databases and planning (e.g. <ref> [AK83b, DM87, Pel88, Hir96, Hir95] </ref> etc.). We give the complexity of the network satisfaction problem for each case if it is known and refer to a new result for the complexity of the NSP for the left-linear relation algebra, the proof of which is deferred to a later section.

Reference-contexts: Now we move on to the algebraic approach. The algebraic counterpart of a field of sets is a boolean algebra and it is a theorem <ref> [Sto36] </ref> that every boolean algebra is isomorphic to a field of sets.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we will be looking at the expressive power and complexity of certain algebraic logics: cylindric and relation algebras. These algebras were invented primarily to handle algebraically the study of relations of various ranks. Tarski showed <ref> [TG87] </ref> that relation algebra can act as a vehicle for set theory and hence all of mathematics.

Reference-contexts: THEOREM 1 Let A be any representable relation algebra with jAj &gt; 2. The satisfaction problem for A is PSPACE-hard. PROOF: We reduce the quantified boolean formulas (QBF) problem to the satisfaction problem for A. QBF is known to be PSPACE complete <ref> [vEB94, page 41] </ref>. So, let OE be any quantified boolean formula using only propositional variables p 0 ; : : : ; p k1 .

Reference-contexts: So the general NSP and the NSP over X (any given square representation X) are equivalent. It turns out that any transitively closed network is satisfiable in the rationals and so the network satisfaction problem for P has cubic complexity (see <ref> [VK86] </ref> with an important correction in [VKvB89]). The Pentagonal Algebra PA has three atoms Id; e; d all self-converse, composition is defined by e fId; dg fe; dg It is not hard to check that PA has exactly one representation X, up to isomorphism. <p> It turns out that any transitively closed atomic network is satisfiable (hence the NSP has cubic complexity for atomic networks) but for general networks transitive closure does not guarantee satisfiability [All84] and the NSP has been shown to be an NP complete problem <ref> [VK86] </ref>. The Left Linear Point Algebra The left linear point algebra was first presented in [Com83], where it is referred to as N 1 . A concrete representation of it appeared in [D 91], see also [AGN94], page 642. <p> In fact the original proof in <ref> [VK86] </ref> is preferable because of its simplicity and elegance, but the method here has wider application. THEOREM 28 The network satisfaction problem for the Allen interval algebra is NP-complete.

Reference-contexts: Before considering complexity, we need to define a network. This issue of complexity then arises when we consider the network satisfaction problem. 2.4 Networks Networks are certain labeled, finite graphs | very widely used in computer science, notably in temporal reasoning <ref> [All84, DM87, VKvB89, DMP91, Hir96] </ref>. They are most easily defined for relation algebra, though the cylindric algebra case is exactly analogous. <p> So the general NSP and the NSP over X (any given square representation X) are equivalent. It turns out that any transitively closed network is satisfiable in the rationals and so the network satisfaction problem for P has cubic complexity (see [VK86] with an important correction in <ref> [VKvB89] </ref>). The Pentagonal Algebra PA has three atoms Id; e; d all self-converse, composition is defined by e fId; dg fe; dg It is not hard to check that PA has exactly one representation X, up to isomorphism. <p> Several authors have studied the expressive power of some of the examples below over linear flows of time or intervals from a linear flow (e.g. <ref> [VKvB89] </ref>). If X and Y are classes of representations of A; B respectively then we can generalise the definitions so that a translation (o; @) is left total over (X ; Y) if every representation in Y is the interpretation (based on (o; @)) of a representation in X .

Reference-contexts: Equivalently the problem is to say whether T A [ fOEg is consistent or not. The time complexity and space complexity of such problems are defined in any textbook on complexity e.g. <ref> [AHU74, vL94] </ref>. The network satisfaction problem (NSP) is a restriction of the satisfaction problem. Here, the problem is to decide whether an L (A)-sentence of the form 9xOE N (x) (for some A-network N ) holds in some representation of A.
