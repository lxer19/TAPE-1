Abstract: We propose a new service discipline, called the Rate-Controlled Static-Priority (RCSP) queueing discipline, that can provide throughput, delay, delay jitter, and loss free guarantees in a connection-oriented packet-switching network. Previously proposed solutions are based on either a time-framing strategy, or a sorted priority queue mechanism. Time-framing schemes suffer from the dependencies that they introduce between the queueing delay and the granularity of bandwidth allocation; sorted priority queue may be difficult to implement. The proposed RCSP queueing discipline avoids both time-framing and sorted priority queue; it achieves flexibility in the allocation of delay and bandwidth, as well as simplicity of implementation. The key idea is to separate rate-control and delay-control functions in the design of the server. Applying this separation of functions will result in a class of service disciplines, of which RCSP is an instance. fl This research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Cooperative Agreement NCR-8919038 with the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, by AT&T Bell Laboratories, Hitachi, Ltd., Hitachi America, Ltd., Pacific Bell, the University of California under a MICRO grant, and the International Computer Science Institute.

Reference-contexts: The scheduler consists of multiple prioritized FCFS queues, and the rate controller consists of a set of regulators corresponding to each connection. We implement each real-time packet queue in the scheduler as a linked list, and the rate controller as a modified version of a calendar queue <ref> [1, 13] </ref>. Notice that the conceptual decomposition of the rate controller into a set of regulators does not imply that there are multiple physical regulators in an implementation; a common mechanism can be shared by all regulators.

Reference-contexts: New service disciplines that aim to provide different qualities of service to different connections have been proposed. In a previous study [15], six rate-based service disciplines were compared: Delay Earliest-Due-Date (Delay-EDD) [6], Virtual Clock [16], Fair Queueing <ref> [2] </ref>, Jitter Earliest-Due-Date (Jitter-EDD) [14], Stop-and-Go [7], and Hierarchical Round Robin (HRR) [9].

Reference-contexts: A relevant issue here is that of jitter control. In the literature, there are different definitions of jitter. In [9], the term is used to capture the burstiness of the traffic, and is defined to be the maximum number of packets in a jitter averaging interval. In <ref> [3, 14] </ref>, the term is used to capture the magnitude of the distortion to the traffic pattern caused by the network, and is defined to be the maximum difference between the delays experienced by any two packets on the same connection. <p> From the network's point of view, the partial reconstruction of traffic patterns, or rate-jitter control inside the network, may be enough to offset the interactions between switches and the network load fluctuations; however, for some applications, a delay-jitter-free service is required <ref> [3, 4, 14] </ref>. If the network does not control delay jitter, applications may have to do buffering at the destination. For this reason, delay jitter control inside the network may be preferred; however, this consideration has to be balanced against the relative complexities of implementing delay-jitter control vs. rate-jitter control. <p> We consider three types of resources: buffer space, bandwidth and schedulability. The buffer space required for a connection to prevent packet loss can be calculated by multiplying the maximum packet arrival rate by the longest residence time of a packet in the switch. To provide deterministic guarantees <ref> [3] </ref>, the overall bandwidth allocated to the connections on any link should not exceed the bandwidth of that link. Schedulability should also be considered. As pointed out in [6], scheduling saturation can occur even if bandwidth is not overbooked. <p> This requires clients to specify their traffic characteristics. We use the (X min ; X ave ; I; P ) traffic characterization as suggested in <ref> [6, 3] </ref>. <p> From the network's point of view, rate-jitter control or partial reconstruction of traffic patterns inside the network is sufficient to control the interaction between switches and the network load fluctuations. However, delay-jitter control may be preferred in the cases when a delay jitter bounded service is desired <ref> [3, 4, 14] </ref>. The important consideration here regards the relative 10 complexities of implementing delay-jitter control vs. rate-jitter control.

Reference-contexts: The First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) discipline, which is used in most conventional networks, may be capable of providing some performance guarantees, but only under a number of constraints and with a very inefficient use of the network's resources <ref> [5] </ref>. New service disciplines that aim to provide different qualities of service to different connections have been proposed.

Reference-contexts: A real-time communication service will allow clients to transport information with performance guarantees expressed in terms of delay, delay jitter, throughput and loss rate bounds. It has been argued that a connection-oriented architecture, with explicit resource allocation and connection admission control, is needed to offer such a real-time service <ref> [6] </ref>. However, in a packet-switching network, packets from different connections will interact with each other at each switch; without proper control, these interactions may adversely affect the network performance experienced by clients. <p> New service disciplines that aim to provide different qualities of service to different connections have been proposed. In a previous study [15], six rate-based service disciplines were compared: Delay Earliest-Due-Date (Delay-EDD) <ref> [6] </ref>, Virtual Clock [16], Fair Queueing [2], Jitter Earliest-Due-Date (Jitter-EDD) [14], Stop-and-Go [7], and Hierarchical Round Robin (HRR) [9]. <p> Jitter-EDD needs to implement a sorted priority queue, which has an O (log N ) insertion operation [11], where N is the number of packets in the queue. This may not be feasible for a high-speed implementation. Jitter-EDD also requires a complicated schedulability test at connection establishment time <ref> [6, 15] </ref>, which is not needed in Stop-and-Go and HRR. In this paper, we will present a new service discipline called Rate-Controlled Static-Priority (RCSP) queueing that overcomes these limitations. <p> is never idle when there is a packet to transmit; in a non-work-conserving discipline, each packet is assigned, either explicitly or implicitly, an eligibility time; even when the server is idle, if no packets are eligible, none will be transmitted [15]. 1 2 Background We consider the paradigm proposed in <ref> [6] </ref> for providing guaranteed service to clients in a packet switching network: before communication starts, the client specifies its traffic characteristics and performance requirements to the network; the client's traffic and performance parameters are translated into local parameters, and a set of connection admission control conditions are tested at each switch; <p> To provide deterministic guarantees [3], the overall bandwidth allocated to the connections on any link should not exceed the bandwidth of that link. Schedulability should also be considered. As pointed out in <ref> [6] </ref>, scheduling saturation can occur even if bandwidth is not overbooked. For example, two packets with delay bounds of 4 time units and service time of 3 time units may arrive at a switch at the same time. <p> This requires clients to specify their traffic characteristics. We use the (X min ; X ave ; I; P ) traffic characterization as suggested in <ref> [6, 3] </ref>. <p> Usually, there are multiple priority levels that the new connection can be placed into. Different connection establishment schemes can be used to choose the priority level for the new connection. One scheme of establishing real-time connection is described in <ref> [6] </ref>, in which a new connection is setup with a one-round trip message: during the forward trip of the establishment message, the new connection is assigned the smallest possible delay bound at each switch to maximize the probability that the new connection's end-to-end delay bound can be met; during the return <p> Solutions have been proposed for Delay-EDD <ref> [6] </ref> and Stop-and-Go [8] to overbook resources by exploiting the traffic burstiness. We are currently extending those ideas to RCSP.

Reference-contexts: between input links and output links at each switch in order to achieve delay-jitter control; HRR does not have this synchronization, and thus can not bound delay-jitter in its current form; however, it is possible to modify HRR to implement Stop-and-Go queueing by framing and synchronizing input and output links <ref> [10] </ref>. For a service discipline with a rate controller, like Jitter-EDD and RCSP, a calendar queue mechanism can be used to implement both the rate-jitter controlling and the delay-jitter controlling regulators.

Reference-contexts: The tests have just O (n) steps, where n is the number of priority levels, and are simple enough to be used in some fast connection establishment scheme <ref> [12] </ref>. Theorem 1 just gives the bounds for the waiting times of packets in the scheduler; the holding times of packets in the regulators have not been taken into account. In the previous section, we have introduced two types of regulators: the rate-jitter controlling regulator and the delay-jitter controlling regulator.
