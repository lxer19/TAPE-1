Reference-contexts: The general framework with which AAP is designed to operate is best describes by describing the process by which a multicast address is allocated: 1. As a continuous process, a higher level protocol, MASC <ref> [2] </ref>, provides a multicast address set to an allocation domain that multicast addresses should be allocated out of. 2. MASC routers periodically send advertisements of this address set to Multcast Address Allocation Servers (MAAS) within the allocation domain using AAP address-set advertisement messages. 3.
