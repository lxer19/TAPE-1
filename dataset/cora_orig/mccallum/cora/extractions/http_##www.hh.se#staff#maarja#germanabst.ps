Abstract: This paper presents an approach to mobile robot path planning using case-based reasoning together with map-based path planning. The map-based path planner is used to seed the case-base with innovative solutions. The casebase stores the paths and the information about their traversability. While planning the route those paths are preferred that according to the former experience are least risky.

Reference-contexts: The map represents the environment in a 2D regular grid. The map can be very general and is not updated but shows only the unremovable objects and the areas where the robot is not allowed to enter. The map-based path planner uses a probabilistic path transform method <ref> [1] </ref>. This method assumes that the environment contains dynamic obstacles and therefore the best path to the goal is not necessarily the shortest.

Reference-contexts: The ability to learn is often achieved by using neural networks, reinforcement learning [7] or sometimes genetic algorithms [5] and is mostly implemented on a local level, e.g. teaching robot to avoid unknown obstacles [4]. Case-based learning appears to be used very seldom ([2], <ref> [3] </ref>, [6], [8]) in mobile robot navigation and the approaches used do not consider changes in the environment. We find that case-based reasoning is a suitable technique for robot path planning and navigation problems in dynamic environments.

Reference-contexts: The task of the global planner is to find a 1 collision free path from start to goal. It poses tasks to a local planner as a sequence of sub-goals. The local reactive planner <ref> [9] </ref>, is then responsible of reaching to every sub-goal while avoiding unknown obstacles. If the local planner fails to reach the subgoal, the path has to be replanned by the global planner. The navigation unit is responsible of determining the position of the robot.
