Abstract: A new methodology for the determination of an objective metric for still image coding is reported. This methodology is applied to obtain a Picture Quality Scale (PQS) for the coding of achromatic images over the full range of image quality defined by the subjective Mean Opinion Score (MOS). This Picture Quality Scale takes into account the properties of visual perception for both global features and localized disturbances. PQS closely approximates the MOS, with a correlation coefficient of more than 0.92, as compared to 0.57 obtained using the conventional WMSE. Extensions and applications of the methodology and of the resulting metric are discussed.

Reference-contexts: This expansion would result from the systematic determination of objective measures for the comparison of coded images, and also from the possibility of successive adjustments to improve or optimize the picture quality for a desired quality of service <ref> [4] </ref>. The objective simulation of performance both with respect to bit rate and image quality would also lead to a more systematic design of image coders. It is important that an objective scale mirror the perceived image quality. <p> We have also discussed some of the extensions and applications of such an objective picture quality metric. Systematic studies of the objective evaluation of images, as well as their subjective assessment, are difficult and only now becoming active areas of research <ref> [4] </ref>. However, the rapid increase in the range and use of electronic imaging and coding and their increasing economic importance justifies renewed attention and specialization of perceptually relevant image quality metrics as a critical missing component for systematic design and for providing the quality of service needed in professional applications.

Reference-contexts: It is important that an objective scale mirror the perceived image quality. For instance, simple distortion scales, such as the signal to noise ratio (PSNR), or even the weighted mean square error (WMSE) <ref> [5] </ref> are good distortion indicators for random errors, but not for structured or correlated errors. <p> We use an integral square measure to compute distortion factors F 1 and F 2 . Because the CCIR has adopted a standard to quantify the effect of noise, we follow that standard in defining F 1 <ref> [5] </ref>. 2.3.1 Distortion Factor F 1 The CCIR 567-1 television noise weighting standard does not take into account Weber's law.

Reference-contexts: the objective assessment of image quality. 2.6 Computation of PQS We compute the PQS quality metric as a linear combination of principal components Z j as J X b j Z j (26) where the b j are the partial regression coefficients which are computed using Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) <ref> [19] </ref> to fit (26) to the mean opinion scores of observers that are obtained experimentally in quality assessment tests. In order to illustrate visually the five distortion factor images, they have been evaluated for the image "Lena" and for a JPEG coder with a (low) quality parameter setting of 15. <p> Note that the goodness of fit is better in the middle of the quality range than at its extremes. This observation is elaborated in section 6. In order to describe the degree of approximation of PQS to MOS quantitatively, the correlation coefficient R between PQS and MOS is evaluated <ref> [19] </ref>. <p> For all sets of combinations of F i , the correlation coefficients R and R fl are shown in Table 5, where R fl is the modified R <ref> [19] </ref> adjusted for the degrees of freedom. Specifically, R fl = R 2 (n 1) p (30) where n is the total number of coded images in the test set, and p is the number of factors F i retained.

Reference-contexts: When the coding method is fixed and the test image data and the coder are fixed, we can tune the picture quality scale to that coder and obtain then more accurate results <ref> [36] </ref>. Such a specialization is useful for coder design or adaptive coding parameter adjustment [14]. 6.5 PQS in Color Picture Coding The PQS methodology has been applied to color picture coding.

Reference-contexts: For color, the importance of a perceptually uniform color space leads us to consider color differences as defined in the Munsell Renotation System which is psychometrically uniform and metric. Then, we can utilize the color differences instead of e (m; n) for a PQS applicable to coded color images <ref> [37, 38] </ref>. 7 Applications of PQS There a number of applications for a perceptually relevant distortion metric such as PQS. Coding techniques can now more confidently be compared by checking their PQS values for the same bit rate, or bit rates for the same image quality.
