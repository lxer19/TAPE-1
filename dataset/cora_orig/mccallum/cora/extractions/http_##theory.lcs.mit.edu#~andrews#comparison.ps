Title: A Performance Comparison of Competitive On-line Routing and State-Dependent Routing  
Author: William Aiello Matthew Andrews Sandeep Bhatt K. R. Krishnan Lisa Zhang 
Abstract: Classic circuit-switched telephone networks as well as modern Broadband Integrated Services Digital Networks (B-ISDN) carry traffic that requires bandwidth reservation along paths. Due to limited resources some requests for service will be denied. It is therefore important to have good admission control and routing strategies to guarantee an efficient use of the network. In this paper we compare the performance of two non-greedy strategies, competitive online routing (col) and state-dependent routing (sdr), by using an extensive set of simulations. Algorithm sdr assumes prior knowledge of the traffic pattern, i.e. the Poisson arrival rates and the exponential holding times, whereas col assumes no knowledge of the traffic. For the case in which the arrival rates are unknown to sdr, algorithm sdr-adapt (the adaptive version of sdr) adjusts its admission decisions by learning the traffic during its handling of the incoming requests. In most of our experiments, sdr has a noticeable performance advantage over col and sdr-adapt by knowing the traffic in advance. Algorithm sdr-adapt outperforms col for the majority of our networks, which indicates the usefulness of adapting to the traffic information. Algorithm col has performance guarantees even without any statistical assumptions on the traffic. Our simulations also suggest some characteristics of col that disagree with past experimental findings [8].

A possible alternative is to generate holding times according to a Pareto distribution. Our preliminary experiments suggest that the rejection rates yielded by all three algorithms are lower under the Pareto distribution than under the exponential distribution.
