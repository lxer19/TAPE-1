Abstract: MIT Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Group Technical Report #204 Abstract: Gibbs random field (GRF) models and co-occurrence statistics are typically considered as separate but useful tools for texture discrimination. In this paper we show an explicit relationship between co-occurrences and a large class of GRF's. This result comes from a new framework based on a set-theoretic concept called the "aura set" and on measures of this set, "aura measures". This framework is also shown to be useful for relating different texture analysis tools: We show how the aura set can be constructed with morphological dilation, how its measure yields co-occurrences, and how it can be applied to characterizing the behavior of the Gibbs model for texture. In particular, we show how the aura measure generalizes, to any number of gray levels and neighborhood order, some properties previously known for just the binary, nearest-neighbor GRF. Finally, we illustrate how these properties can guide one's intuition about the types of GRF patterns which are most likely to form.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we describe such an investigation for the class of GRF models first introduced by Besag [1], and subsequently used in <ref> [2, 3] </ref> for texture analysis and synthesis. Our investigation is far from complete, but the approach that we use will illustrate how 1 the capabilities of a given model can be analyzed irrespective of the application domain. <p> Since the establishment of the equivalence between Markov and Gibbs random fields there has been renewed emphasis on their noncausal 2-D versions. In particular, the GRF's have been explored for the representation of natural texture patterns <ref> [19, 3, 20, 21, 22] </ref>. The assumption that the GRF can model image textures has also been used to justify GRF models in image compression, classification, restoration, and segmentation [23, 5, 24, 25]. <p> It is important to remember that the consideration of these patterns is justified by the fact that in MAP estimation, it is imperative to understand the contribution of the prior distribution to the structure of the MAP estimate. In <ref> [3] </ref>, Cross and Jain observed that sampling textures directly from the Gibbs distribution (30) often produces patterns in which one color predominates. To remedy this situation, they proposed that a uniform histogram constraint be imposed on the sampled patterns and that the Metropolis exchange algorithm be used to sample them. <p> This ratio eliminates the need for computing the partition function Z and has the notable side effect of canceling out all terms that appear as constants in the Gibbs energy function. In this paper, as in <ref> [3, 22] </ref>, we assume a constant external field in (29), i.e., the V s 's are independent of the site location s, so that these will cancel in the ratio. Thus, we omit these terms from the Gibbs energy. <p> The autobinomial model was first introduced in the statistics literature by Besag [1] and first studied as a texture model by Cross and Jain <ref> [3] </ref>. In the isotropic case, we have V (g; g 0 ) = figg 0 . <p> The diagonal dominance of co-occurrence matrices has long been understood to relate to pattern "clumpiness" [16]. Here the aura self-measures give a quantitative measure of this patterning. From the aura-based analysis and simulations, it appears that the patterns generated by Cross and Jain <ref> [3] </ref> which they said had "converged" much sooner than these, were not actually near their minimum energy states. Instead, they were still changing, albeit slowly, and approaching patterns such as we have shown. How far a given pattern is from its ground state is still an interesting question.

In this section we show how the aura set can be constructed using a simple morphological operation. For A; B S, we consider only the case A " B = ;.

This is true in image processing when the site values correspond to image gray levels.

Reference-contexts: Note that causal and semicausal neighborhoods are never symmetric. On the other hand, in applications employing Markov/Gibbs random fields, the neighborhoods are noncausal and must be symmetric. A symmetric neighborhood structure is also called a "neighborhood system" by Geman and Geman <ref> [5] </ref>. The next proposition, proved in Appendix B, states the equivalence between aura measure symmetry and neighborhood symmetry. <p> In particular, the GRF's have been explored for the representation of natural texture patterns [19, 3, 20, 21, 22]. The assumption that the GRF can model image textures has also been used to justify GRF models in image compression, classification, restoration, and segmentation <ref> [23, 5, 24, 25] </ref>. <p> It is not difficult to prove that the above joint probability distribution defines a Markov random field with respect to the neighborhood structure fN s ; s 2 Sg <ref> [5] </ref>. A textural pattern is obtained by sampling the above probability distribution. Note that the most probable patterns are those that globally minimize the Gibbs energy. <p> This property is useful in simulations when we analyze the patterns formed. The second special case we consider is the Potts model from statistical mechanics [29]. It was used by Geman and Geman <ref> [5] </ref> in the context of image restoration and by Derin and Elliott [25] in the context of texture-based image segmentation. In these references the external field was assumed zero (i.e., no single-site clique potentials). <p> The scale factor in the numerator is typically chosen in the range c 2 (0; 10]. Although its choice is ad hoc (theoretically optimal choices are impractical, see Geman and Geman <ref> [5] </ref>), its behavior is understood as a rate constant that is proportional to how slow the annealing progresses. One iteration is counted as M N attempted exchanges. An exchange is attempted whenever two randomly picked sites have different locations and gray levels.

Reference-contexts: The boundary length property has several useful interpretations. In this section we describe relationships to the Ising model of statistical mechanics, to fluid mechanics, and to graph-theoretic concepts. Measuring the boundary length leads to an intuitive explanation of the behavior of the well-known binary Ising model of statistical mechanics <ref> [6] </ref>. This model consists of interacting spins on a binary lattice with the four nearest neighbor structure. There are two types of spins, up and down, to whose 5 sites we associate the sets A and B, respectively.

Reference-contexts: This is the checkerboard pattern, where spins alternate and the boundary between A and B is maximized. The cases of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism in the Ising model are also analogous to the separation and mixing of two fluids <ref> [7] </ref>. In aura notation, the miscibility of two fluids is represented by m (A; B) 1 . For immiscible fluids m (A; B) is minimized; for miscible, m (A; B) is maximized.

Reference-contexts: When m (A; B) is normalized over some unit area (or more typically for fluids, unit volume), it gives a measure of the interfacial energy driving the separation of the two phases A and B <ref> [8] </ref>. Since the aura measure is valid on a general lattice with any number of fluids A i ; i = 0; 1; : : : ; n 1, and any neighborhood structure, it generalizes both the boundary length and miscibility concepts.

Reference-contexts: Continuing the analogy, let A be a subset of graph vertices. Then the set of the graph edges linking the vertices of A to the vertices of A c , the complementary set of A, is called the edge boundary of A <ref> [9] </ref>. The number of these edges can be considered a measure of the edge boundary length. This number is also identical to m (A; A c ), the aura measure of the subset A with respect to its complementary set A c . <p> The aura measure is therefore a slight but useful generalization of the concept of an edge boundary in a graph. Indeed, the optimization problems used in texture synthesis can be interpreted as generalized isoperimetric problems <ref> [9] </ref> defined on the graph underlying the image lattice, as we will see in Appendix G. Computing invariants is an important goal of pattern recognition. <p> G Generalized Isoperimetric Problem Using a graph-theoretic point of view, (34) can be interpreted as a generalized isoperimetric problem. Following <ref> [9] </ref>, we denote by e (H; G) the edge boundary of a subgraph H in a graph G. <p> The cost function of (34) is a weighted sum of these generalized "edge boundaries," and therefore its minimization under the uniform histogram constraint can be construed as a generalized isoperimetric problem in the sense of <ref> [9] </ref>. These relations may make it possible to consider some network traffic and graph problems as problems in "pattern control".

Reference-contexts: Computing invariants is an important goal of pattern recognition. This interpretation of the aura measure in terms of edge boundary allows us to conclude that the aura measure is invariant under all graph isomorphisms <ref> [10] </ref> applied to the graph defined by the lattice and the neighborhood structure.

Reference-contexts: In 2-D, Monte Carlo algorithms such as the classical Metropolis method attempt to exchange values between pairs of sites in an effort to minimize the energy of the system. Such methods are finding increasing use in image processing, especially through the use of simulating annealing <ref> [11] </ref>. The effect of exchange operations on the measures of aura sets is derived in Appendix F. Please note: For the rest of the paper, we will assume that the finite lattice is rectangular with periodic boundary conditions.

Since then, co-occurrence matrices and features derived from them have become a very popular tool for a variety of practical texture analysis problems [13, 14].

Reference-contexts: This is equivalent to an aura matrix with the corresponding two-neighbor symmetric N s . In <ref> [15] </ref> co-occurrences were generalized to provide statistics of features instead of just gray levels. The same can be easily done with the aura matrix, providing "mixing" and "clumping" measures for any pattern feature.

Reference-contexts: In all these cases, the aura matrix generalizes the pairwise co-occurrence matrix by allowing the counts to occur over any geometry. Thus, it gives us a cohesive and notationally appealing framework for forming combined co-occurrence matrices similar to the ones considered in Rosenfeld and Kak <ref> [16] </ref>. Combining co-occurrences is important for reducing the large number of features contained in the matrices. Rosenfeld and Kak also found that the combination of co-occurrences along more than one displacement vector were better for texture discrimination when texture directionality was not important. <p> Note that these conditional probabilities depend on the neighborhood geometry and size. They can be interpreted as neighborhood-based gray-level transition probabilities. They differ from the probabilities defined in <ref> [16] </ref> in that they do not depend on the image scan direction. With this probabilistic interpretation, we can write the correlation, covariance, and correlation coefficients of the lattice site values. We let g, g 0 , and g 00 be three gray-level values. <p> For the positive bonding parameters, they become tridiagonal. In another paper [30], the authors establish more precisely the conditions under which this behavior occurs. The tridiagonal aura matrices are shown in Figure 8. The diagonal dominance of co-occurrence matrices has long been understood to relate to pattern "clumpiness" <ref> [16] </ref>. Here the aura self-measures give a quantitative measure of this patterning. From the aura-based analysis and simulations, it appears that the patterns generated by Cross and Jain [3] which they said had "converged" much sooner than these, were not actually near their minimum energy states.

Reference-contexts: Rosenfeld and Kak also found that the combination of co-occurrences along more than one displacement vector were better for texture discrimination when texture directionality was not important. A more recent work with similar implications is <ref> [17] </ref> where the texture descriptors are made from a combination of pairwise co-occurrences, which is equivalent to an aura matrix with the eight nearest neighbors structure.

Reference-contexts: Moreover aura and co-occurrence matrices need not be positive semidefinite like auto-correlation matrices. In tests by Conners and Harlow comparing discrimination abilities of texture analysis tools <ref> [18] </ref>, the co-occurrences performed much better than the power spectrum, which is the Fourier transform of the auto-correlation. Conners and Harlow concluded that the co-occurrences contain more "textural information" than the correlations.

When the model is first order isotropic with x s 2 f0; 1g, we get a binary nearest-neighbor model from which the famous Ising model <ref> [28] </ref> can be derived by making the transformation x s ! 2x s 1. The autobinomial model was first introduced in the statistics literature by Besag [1] and first studied as a texture model by Cross and Jain [3]. <p> This characterization in terms of boundary length is well known in the physics literature <ref> [28] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The aura matrix properties are easily checked for the jSj = 64 fi 64 lattices used here. We note that all of the aura matrices are becoming anti-tridiagonal. For the positive bonding parameters, they become tridiagonal. In another paper <ref> [30] </ref>, the authors establish more precisely the conditions under which this behavior occurs. The tridiagonal aura matrices are shown in Figure 8. The diagonal dominance of co-occurrence matrices has long been understood to relate to pattern "clumpiness" [16]. Here the aura self-measures give a quantitative measure of this patterning. <p> We have begun investigating the ability of the aura to represent this "distance" by examining its trace during the energy minimization. The trace can be shown to grow linearly with the number of gray levels <ref> [30] </ref>. For higher order neighborhoods the matrices tend to become tridiagonal faster, resulting in a steeper slope of the trace vs. the number of gray levels. <p> This means that certain gray levels can not occur as neighbors in the ground state textures produced by the model! This can be a serious limitation of this model; it is addressed specifically elsewhere <ref> [30] </ref>. Now we consider anisotropy with fi k of varying magnitude. As the relative magnitudes of the parameters are changed, the relative weights of the miscibilities change as given in (40). <p> Examples of these minimum bounds, as well as images which illustrate these geometric constraints are provided in <ref> [30] </ref> where auras are applied to the study of the ground states of the Gibbs energy used in texture modeling. G Generalized Isoperimetric Problem Using a graph-theoretic point of view, (34) can be interpreted as a generalized isoperimetric problem.

Reference-contexts: The aura matrices for these two isotropic neighborhoods are shown to illustrate that their sum gives the anisotropic aura matrix. phase transitions <ref> [31] </ref>. 6.4 Anisotropic Fields With the linear formulation of (40) we know that the aura matrices of anisotropic texture patterns will be a sum of the tridiagonal and anti-tridiagonal matrices taken over isotropic subneighborhoods.

Reference-contexts: These result because the repulsion between vertical pairs is stronger than the repulsion between horizontal pairs. An alternate interpretation of this behavior is that the rate of optimization in the vertical direction is twice that in the horizontal direction <ref> [32] </ref>. Either way, the aura matrix gives both a quantitative and more intuitive characterization of the texture pattern throughout its formation. 24 (a) (b) in (b) has twice the value of the horizontal parameter.
