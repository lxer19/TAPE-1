Abstract: I present an overview of final coalgebras together with a description of initial algebras, showing the analogies between the two. In particular, I show how initiality of algebras leads to the properties of definition by recursion and proof by induction. I then show how final coalgebras have the analogous properties of definition by corecursion and proof by coinduction, motivating the latter by Peter Aczel's anti-foundation set theory. I present two of the current existence theorems for final coal-gebras (the first due to Michael Barr and the second to Peter Aczel and Nax Mendler). Finally, I present a list of some open questions/research projects that I intend to study for my dissertation.

Reference-contexts: Set theory with the anti-foundation axiom is the first setting in which coinduction was used as a proof principle for final coalgebras in general [Acz88], and a categorical definition of bisimulations and coinduc-tion was given in <ref> [AM89] </ref>. <p> The question of existence Returning to the question, when an endofunctor has a final coalgebra, there are some sufficient conditions for concluding that a particular functor has a final coalgebra in a particular category. For instance, Peter Aczel and Nax Mendler <ref> [AM89] </ref> show that every set-based endofunctor on SETS, the category of sets and classes, has a final coalgebra. <p> However, sufficient conditions for the existence of an initial algebra do not always dualize to sufficient conditions for the existence of a final coalgebra. In set theory, for example, proofs of the existence of initial algebras tend to rely on transfinite recursion, while the final coalgebra theorem in <ref> [AM89] </ref> involves a much more elaborate construction (see also [MD97]). There are categories C and endofunctors F such that Barr's sequence constructed does not stabilize, although there is a final coalgebra.

Reference-contexts: Assuming the foundation axiom, this final coalgebra is not isomorphic to V . It is, however, a model for the anti-foundation universe. Another result is due to Michael Barr <ref> [Bar92] </ref>. Given an endofunctor G on a category C (with certain conditions on C), one constructs an ordinally 12 indexed sequence of objects A ff and maps g fi ff : A fi ! A ff where fi &gt; ff. <p> Furthermore, the isomorphism A ff ! A ff+1 (given by (g ff+1 ff ) 1 ) is the structure map (destructor function) for a final coalgebra. There is a dual theorem presented in <ref> [Bar92] </ref>. One constructs a dual sequence that stabilizes at an initial algebra (if it stabilizes). However, sufficient conditions for the existence of an initial algebra do not always dualize to sufficient conditions for the existence of a final coalgebra.

Reference-contexts: Then, the general definition of coalgebras is given alongside the more familiar definition of algebras. Throughout, we will return to the more familiar category of algebras so that the analogies described above will be clear (see the table above, due to [Rut96] and <ref> [Jac95] </ref>, for more on the dualities involved). 2 In particular, the characteristic properties of initial algebras (induction and recursion) will be compared to the analogous properties of final coalgebras (coinduction and corecursion, respectively). <p> However, the analogy between induction and coinduction is not as strong as one might like. Bisimulation is dual to the notion of congruences on algebras, and not to the notion of inductive predicates <ref> [Jac95] </ref>. We return to the previous examples of coalgebras for examples of bisimu-lation relations. Recall that a coalgebra S= hS; f i for the functor X 7! AfiX can be thought of as a set of infinite streams, closed under tail : S ! S.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to see that initial algebras are unique up to isomorphism. Furthermore, any initial F -algebra is a fixed point for the functor F (specifically, S ~ = F S via f , c.f. <ref> [Lam70] </ref>). 6 If Sis an initial F -algebra, then the existence of a unique morphism S! T for any other F -algebra T gives a principle of definition by recursion.

Some examples of coalgebras Each of these examples is treated in detail in [BM96]. See also <ref> [MD97] </ref>, [Mos97], [JR97] and [Acz94] for more details on these and other examples. (1) Streams An (infinite) stream over a set A is often defined as an ordered pair ha; si where a 2 A and s is again a stream. <p> Corecursion is dual to the notion of recursion in that a recursive function is a function out of (a generalization of) the least fixed point and a corecursive function is a function into (a generalization of) the greatest fixed point <ref> [MD97] </ref>. Final coalgebras are, in fact, initial algebras in a different category. If C op is the dual category of C and if F op : C op ! C op is defined in the obvious way (given F : C ! C), then, as noted in [MD97], the category of <p> greatest fixed point <ref> [MD97] </ref>. Final coalgebras are, in fact, initial algebras in a different category. If C op is the dual category of C and if F op : C op ! C op is defined in the obvious way (given F : C ! C), then, as noted in [MD97], the category of F -coalgebras is exactly the dual category of F op -algebras. Thus, an initial F op -algebra is a final F -coalgebra and vice versa. The study of final coalgebras is not merely the study of initial algebras all over again, however. <p> In set theory, for example, proofs of the existence of initial algebras tend to rely on transfinite recursion, while the final coalgebra theorem in [AM89] involves a much more elaborate construction (see also <ref> [MD97] </ref>). There are categories C and endofunctors F such that Barr's sequence constructed does not stabilize, although there is a final coalgebra. For example, the final coalgebra for the powerset functor, P : SETS ! SETS is a proper class (and a model for set theory with the anti-foundation axiom).

(1) Streams An (infinite) stream over a set A is often defined as an ordered pair ha; si where a 2 A and s is again a stream. <p> From this, one can conclude that, if aRb, then a and b satisfy all of the same sentences of L (AtProp). Moreover, if a and b satisfy the same sentences of L (AtProp), then there is a bisimulation relation R such that aRb (see <ref> [Mos97] </ref>, for instance, for this and other results). It follows that in a final coalgebra, if a and b satisfy the same sentences, then a = b. Bisimulations on non-deterministic automata over a set A are easily char acterized. <p> Aczel and Mendler's final coalgebra theorem, on the other hand, constructs the final coalgebra as a quotient of colimits. While this is an explicit construction, in practice it is difficult to learn much about the structure of the final coalgebra so obtained. Larry Moss has shown <ref> [Mos97] </ref>, however, that given certain conditions on the endofunctor, F : SETS ! SETS, there is a characterization of elements of the final F -coalgebra.

Reference-contexts: The study of final coalgebras is not merely the study of initial algebras all over again, however. In moving from C to C op , one often gives up familiar properties (like distributivity). Also, F op may not share properties with F <ref> [Rut95] </ref>. As an example, the final coalgebra for the endofunctor F on Sets given 7 by F (X) = X + 1 is N = hN [ f1g; wi.
