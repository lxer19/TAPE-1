Abstract: and main result of this talk. Some remarks will be given at the end of my report. Bose-Einstein Condensation(BEC) is a basic prediction and natural result of quantum statistics. From the experiment on the superfluid phase transition on He-4, we can obtain some knowledges on the BEC, but the He-4 is a strongly-interaction system. What BEC means that there is a macroscopic number of particle will condensed into a single quantum state|zero momentum state. Even there is no interaction among the particles. In other word, such a BEC sompletely originate from the exchange symmetry for the bosons. almost seveny years passed, up to 1995,Such a "ideal" BEC has been observed in a cloud of approximately 2000 Rb-87 atoms cooled to temperatures as low as 20 nanokelvins. Signatures of the BEC were seen by relaxing the magnetic trap, allowing the atoms to expand freely, and then imaging the cloud|and hence the velocity distribution of atoms in the cloud| by laser light. i.e., the velocity distribution can be directly meausured in the experiment, then one can argue that this is the distribution of
