Title: Representation and Adaptation of Organization Coordination Knowledge for Autonomous Agent Systems  
Author: Trent Jaeger and Atul Prakash

Abstract: We present a framework that represents and adapts the organization coordination knowledge of autonomous agent systems. Organization coordination knowledge represents long-term knowledge about problem solving relationships between agents. As problem solving conditions change, organization coordination knowledge must be adapted to maintain system performance. Our framework includes: (1) an organization model that represents organization coordination knowledge; (2) a model that represents adaptation knowledge; and (3) an adaptation mechanism that uses AI techniques to find an organization model whose predicted performance satisfies a performance goal.

Reference-contexts: An agent's knowledge about its organizational relationships is called organization coordination knowledge [2]. Researchers have shown that, in systems with a high level of uncertainty, predefining organizational responsibilities in advance is too inflexible <ref> [1] </ref>. Many autonomous agent systems being proposed today expect to perform in environments with significant uncertainty, so our framework must also be able to adapt its organization coordination knowledge as conditions change.

Reference-contexts: If agents organize themselves, such that any agent is relatively close to the agents it needs to coordinate with most often, coordination costs should be reasonable. An agent's knowledge about its organizational relationships is called organization coordination knowledge <ref> [2] </ref>. Researchers have shown that, in systems with a high level of uncertainty, predefining organizational responsibilities in advance is too inflexible [1].

Reference-contexts: For example, an operator to create a team may imply the creation of communication links between the team's manager agent and the agents that the team members communicated with in the past. Ishida, Gasser, and Yokoo <ref> [3] </ref> identify two categories of adaptation knowledge: (1) agent-agent relationships and (2) agent-organization relationships. Agent-agent relationships are agent and link performance parameters that enable an agent to suggest modifications to improve its performance. We define agent-agent relationships based on performance for messages sent or performance in a team.

Reference-contexts: We have specified the adaptation problem in such a way that it is isomorphic to the automatic workflow improvement problem <ref> [4] </ref>, so we can apply a slightly modified version of the workflow improvement mechanism to this problem. The steps of the adaptation mechanism are listed below (numbers correspond to steps in Figure 3): 1. Define organization model o 1 , the initial organi zation model. 2.

Reference-contexts: For example, if the ratio of an agent's performance within a team to the agent's performance outside the team is low, then an operator to leave the team is generated (formalization of Talukdar's concept of team synergy <ref> [6] </ref>). Agent-organization relationships are organization performance parameters from which the effect of an operator on the organization's performance is estimated. We define agent-organization relationships number of messages per problem, solution quality, and fault tolerance.
