Abstract: Computer vision research at The Hebrew University focuses on the reconstruction and recognition of 3D objects using a moving camera. This report reviews our work in this area during the period May 1993 August 1994. The main areas of research were:

Reference-contexts: We have developed a method to stabilize the image by finding the ego-motion of the camera. This task of the recovery of ego motion becomes simpler once one image region can be registered along several frames <ref> [ Ben-Ezra et al., 1994 ] </ref> . With the ego-motion known, image stabilization can be accomplished by canceling the rotational effects [ Irani et al., 1994 ] .

Reference-contexts: In this manner, the estimated solution takes into account all the existing measurements and all the defined constraints. In <ref> [ Hel-Or and Werman, 1994a ] </ref> a simple and efficient interpretation strategy is shown for these constrained objects. The fusion of the constraints and the measurements is performed using the Kalman filter.

Reference-contexts: We call these kind of models constrained models. In <ref> [ Hel-Or and Werman, 1994b ] </ref> we present a general framework that can deal with all types of spatial constraints. The method solves the the localization problems where constraints and measurements are considered and fused incrementally.

With the ego-motion known, image stabilization can be accomplished by canceling the rotational effects <ref> [ Irani et al., 1994 ] </ref> . In addition, once the ego-motion of the camera is known, 3D structure of the scene can be extracted by building a depth-map of the scene. fl This research was sponsored by ARPA through the U.S.

Reference-contexts: This may result in grave instability in the reconstruction process; two data sets which are arbitrarily close to each other can be assigned two radically different interpolants. In our approach to surface reconstruction <ref> [ Keren and Werman, 1994 ] </ref> , rather than finding an optimal solution, we construct a probability estimate over all solutions, and average the solutions based on their probability. This Bayesian approach gives a more correct and stable interpolation.
