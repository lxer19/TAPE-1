Title: Type-of-Service Routing in Datagram Delivery Systems  
Author: Ibrahim Matta, A. Udaya Shankar 
Abstract: The Internet is expected to support various services, including best-effort services and guaranteed services. For best-effort services, we propose a new approach to achieving type-of-service (TOS) classes with adaptive next-hop routing. We consider two TOS classes, namely, delay-sensitive and throughput-sensitive. As in routing protocols such as OSPF and integrated IS-IS, each node has a different next-hop for each destination and TOS class. Traditionally, a node has a single FCFS queue for each outgoing link, and the next-hops are computed using link measurements. In our approach, we attempt to isolate the two traffic classes by using for each outgoing link a separate FCFS queue for each TOS class; the link is shared cyclicly between its TOS queues. The next-hops for the delay-sensitive traffic adapts to link delays of that traffic. The next-hops for the throughput-sensitive traffic adapts to overall link utilizations. We compare our approach with the traditional approach using discrete-event simulation and Liapunov analysis (for stability of routes). Our approach offers lower end-to-end delay to the delay-sensitive traffic. A related property is that the routes for the delay-sensitive traffic are more stable, i.e. less oscillations. An unexpected property is that the overall end-to-end delay is lower, because the throughput-sensitive traffic moves away to under-utilized routes.

In such an extended service environment, our findings would still apply to traffic classes requiring best-effort service. In addition, our approach appears scalable as each router needs to maintain information only about each TOS class rather than each connection.

Reference-contexts: Such simultaneous traffic shifts result in a bad performance, i.e. higher delay and network under-utilization. This effect increases as ff k increases. (In practice, ff k depend on several factors, and can be quite high <ref> [34] </ref>.) Consider the simple case where ff k = 1, for all k. It can be seen that isolation, whenever possible 2 , provides the optimal performance for both traffic classes [35]. In this case, we are constrained to use a single path for each traffic class.

Reference-contexts: It can be seen that isolation, whenever possible 2 , provides the optimal performance for both traffic classes <ref> [35] </ref>. In this case, we are constrained to use a single path for each traffic class. Thus, in order to maximize the throughput of the throughput-sensitive traffic, we should send its packets over the maximum capacity link, i.e. path 2.

Reference-contexts: It is obvious that TOS2 relies upon the delay-sensitive traffic being a small proportion of the overall traffic. When the proportion of delay-sensitive traffic is not small, TOS2 performs worse than TOS1 because the delay-sensitive traffic in TOS2 suffers from higher queueing delay than in TOS1 <ref> [36] </ref>. However, the performance of TOS2 can be restored by simply allowing, for example, the delay-sensitive queue to get two turns for every turn of the throughput-sensitive queue. The natural extension of this would be to give delay-sensitive packets absolute priority over throughput-sensitive packets.

Reference-contexts: Future work remains to similarly analyze such situations and propose a scheduling discipline that dynamically allocates turns to the TOS queues based on traffic estimates. There might be other possible approaches to adaptive next-hop TOS routing. One approach <ref> [37] </ref> is to maintain for delay-sensitive traffic two minimum propagation delay routes and use the secondary route when the primary route becomes congested. This approach attempts to avoid the bad effect that queueing delay may have when it dominates measured link delay in delay-based routing.

Reference-contexts: A related idea in virtual-circuit models is the packing of low-bandwidth connections over a subset of the routes leaving the remaining routes free for high-bandwidth connections, thus in effect isolating both types of connections <ref> [38] </ref>. Regarding the analysis techniques, in datagram models it is reasonable to make the quasi-static assumption that steady-state is reached between two successive routing updates. This is because packet transmission times are small compared to the routing update interval.
