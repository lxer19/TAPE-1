Title: Evolving Databases: An Application to Electronic Commerce  
Author: Bradley Fordham, Serge Abiteboul, Yelena Yesha 
Date: 1997 1  
Note: INTERNATIONAL DATABASE ENGINEERING AND APPLICATIONS SYMPOSIUM,  
Abstract: Many complex and dynamic database applications such as product modeling and negotiation monitoring require a number of features that have been adopted in semantic models and databases such as active rules, constraints, inheritance, etc. Unfortunately, each feature has largely been considered in isolation. Furthermore, in a commercial negotiation, participants staking their financial well-beings will never accept a system they cannot gain a precise behavioral understanding of. We attack these problems with a rich and extensible database model, evolving databases, with a clear and precise semantics based on evolving algebras [3]. We also briefly describe a prototype implementation of the model [10].

Reference-contexts: The buyer now wishes to conceal the fact that he/she is seeking this coveted color as long as possible. Finally, some applications may require even more complex access mechanisms such as agent-teaming <ref> [16] </ref>. In this paradigm, neither the vendor nor the buyer can update the product model. However another entity, the vendor/buyer team, can change the price, delivery date, etc. The team is given full access to all three entities.

Reference-contexts: The domain of negotiations is very wide. (See, e.g. [30, 32, 31], for some general presentations.)

As we will see briefly, the EDB approach allows us to model complex electronic negotiations and the distributed EA approach allows us to to enact such negotiations.
