Abstract: The Art Gallery Problem is the problem of determining the number of observers necessary to cover an art gallery room such that every point is seen by at least one observer. This problem is well known and has a linear solution for the 2 dimensional case, but little is known in the 3-D case. In this paper we present a polynomial time solution for the 3-D version of the Art Gallery Problem. Because the problem is NP-hard, the solution presented is an approximation, and we present the bounds to our solution. Our solution uses techniques from Computational Geometry, Graph Coloring and Set Coverage. A complexity analysis is presented for each step and an analysis of the overall quality of the solution is given.

Reference-contexts: We can build a terrain model by computing a triangulation of the points X, Y in the plane and giving each vertex a height corresponding to the elevation of point X, Y. The Delaunay triangulation, which is the dual of the Voronoi diagram <ref> [1] </ref>, has the nice property that it maximizes the minimum angle of the triangles [14], thereby reducing the roughness of the approximating surface [16]. A Delaunay triangulation of a terrain used as an example in this paper is presented in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: This is called local visibility; later this condition will be relaxed to reduce the number of observers. Bose et al. showed that b n 2 c vertex observers are sometimes necessary and always sufficient to cover a polyhedral terrain <ref> [2] </ref>. They presented an algorithm to place b 3fln 5 c vertex observers in linear time using the 5-coloring algorithm and selecting the 3 least used colors. This idea is applied in this work using a modified version of the 5-coloring algorithm given by Chiba [3].

Reference-contexts: They presented an algorithm to place b 3fln 5 c vertex observers in linear time using the 5-coloring algorithm and selecting the 3 least used colors. This idea is applied in this work using a modified version of the 5-coloring algorithm given by Chiba <ref> [3] </ref>. In his algorithm, Chiba selects colors randomly among the set of possible colors to paint a vertex. <p> Euler's formula guarantees the presence of at least one vertex with degree 6 or less in a planar graph [12], so the algorithm always applies (special care is necessary when removing a vertex with degree 5 or 6, see <ref> [3] </ref> for details).

Reference-contexts: For a polygon with n vertices, b n 3 c observers are sufficient and sometimes necessary to cover the interior of the polygon. The first proof was given by Chvatal <ref> [4] </ref>; later Fisk gave a simpler proof, using triangulation of the polygon and, since a triangulated polygon is 3-colored, selecting the least used color will generate the bound [9]. The placement of observers can be done in linear time [11].

Reference-contexts: The final set of observers placed in the terrain is presented in 2.4 Complexity Analysis The problem of computing the minimum number of observers to cover the whole terrain was proved to be NP-hard by reduction from Satisfiability (SAT) to this problem <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> Using geometric properties of the terrain it is possible to show that the whole terrain can be seen by nm observers if and only if the formula F is satisfiable. More details can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. The solution presented here runs in polynomial time. A complexity analysis for each step in the algorithm is presented below with a pointer to more detailed references. * Step 1: 1. Delaunay triangulation: O (nlog (n)) see Preparata and Shamos [15]. 2. <p> It is complete because it is possible to make a reduction from SAT to this problem similar to the one presented earlier <ref> [5] </ref>. A useful and similar optimization problem is the following: Given n observers and a terrain, where should we place them in order to maximize the overall coverage of the terrain?.

Reference-contexts: The pseudocode of this step is presented in Figure 6: The greedy technique used in this step (line 11) is a well known solution to the Set Coverage problem and is described in <ref> [6] </ref>. The test executed in line 3 eliminates some visibility computation and reduces the overall run time. <p> Selection of observers: the algorithm pre sented in Figure 11 is O (n 3 ). The overall complexity of the algorithm as presented here is O (n 3 ) because of the visibility test (3.1) and the selection of observers (3.3). Cormen et al <ref> [6] </ref> suggests that it is possible to implement the selection of observers in linear time. Doing so may improve the run-time of the algorithm, but will not improve its overall time complexity bound. <p> The cost of the overall solution C is computed and compared with the cost of the optimal solution C fl , which gives a rate of O (log (n)), see <ref> [6] </ref> for details in the greedy technique applied to the set covering problem. This bound is acceptable for a small number of observers and reasonable for a large number of observers. The visibility map in the original terrain obtained by the final placement is presented in Figure 9.

Reference-contexts: In the first, all points in the DEM are considered and the intervisibility of every pair of points is computed, as presented by Franklin and Ray <ref> [10] </ref>. The second approach models the terrain as a collection of disjoint triangles. This representation is called a Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) in geographic information systems or a Polyhedral Terrain in computational geometry.

By definition of a polyhedral terrain, an observer placed on vertex v can see at least all the triangles that are adjacent to v.
