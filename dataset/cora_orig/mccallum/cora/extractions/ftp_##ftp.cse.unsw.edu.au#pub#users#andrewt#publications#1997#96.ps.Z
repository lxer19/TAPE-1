Abstract: Ripple Down Rules (RDR) is a knowledge acquisition method for knowledge based systems (KBS) which facilitates incremental acquisition of knowledge and ensures that the previous performance of the KBS is not degraded by the incremental addition of the new knowledge. This approach is now well established for single classification tasks and more recently has been extended to multiple classification tasks. This paper describes the further extension of the approach to configuration tasks. The test domain for this study is the configuration of ion chromatography methods in analytical chemistry.

Reference-contexts: It is worth noting that the tree is extremely unbalanced and resembles a decision list with decision lit refinements rather than a tree <ref> (Catlett 1992) </ref>. With this structure the only case that can reach the new conclusion is the case associated with the rule that gave the incorrect conclusion.

Reference-contexts: RDR Background Ripple Down Rules (RDR) is based on the idea that when a KBS makes an incorrect conclusion the new rule that is added to correct that conclusion should only be used in the same context in which the mistake was made <ref> (Compton and Jansen 1990) </ref>. In practice this means attaching the rule at the end of the sequence of rules that were evaluated leading to the wrong conclusion. Thus, this rule will only be evaluated in the same context in which the mistake was made.

Reference-contexts: Menzies has reduced a number of KBS tasks to abduction and proposed the idea of RDR style improvements in the reasoning over the graph, but how this will be implemented does not seem to be resolved yet. <ref> (Menzies and Compton 1995) </ref>. Fensel has developed the idea of matching and modifying PSMs over a wider range than Menzies but this work is still at the theoretical development stage (Fensel ). Acknowledgments This work has been supported by an Australian Research Council Grant.

Reference-contexts: Configuration RDR 5.1 Machine learning developed system This study follows an earlier project were machine learning was used to develop an Ion Chromatography expert system <ref> (Mulholland, Preston et al. 1996) </ref>. The 4000 cases were used to develop a series of classification knowledge bases each able to decide on one of the components of the method given the other components and the other data for the case.

Reference-contexts: A configuration is a solution if it is complete and valid. A sample case is a set of attributes A = -A1, A2, ...., An-where Ai = -Mi1, Mi2, ..., Mih Ai set of all values for attribute Ai Mij set of all values for Mij Following Puppe <ref> (Puppe 1993) </ref> configuration problem solving methods fall into three main categories: heuristic configuration, model based configuration and case based configuration. One of the major problem solving methods used for configuration is "propose and revise" orgininally developed for SALT (Marcus and McDermott 1989).
