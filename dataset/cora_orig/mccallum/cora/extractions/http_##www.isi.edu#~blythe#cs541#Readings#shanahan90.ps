Title: Representing Continuous Change in The Event Calculus

Abstract: The Event Calculus of Kowalski and Sergot only deals with discrete change. This paper introduces a simplified version of the Event Calculus and extends it to deal with continuous change, as in the height of a falling object or the level of liquid in a filling vessel. The idea of autotermination is introduced. A period of continuous change autoterminates if it brings about the event which terminates it. For example, when the increasing level of water in a sink reaches the overflow, it ceases to increase. The formulation is applied to a simple example with liquid filling a sink, and to a more complicated one with many tanks discharging liquid into another tank.

Reference-contexts: The ontology of the Situation Calculus makes it hard to represent partially ordered or simultaneous events, or continuous change. To overcome these shortcomings, several authors have developed richer calculi for representing change <ref> [McDermott, 1982, Hayes, 1985, Allen, 1984, Kowalski and Sergot, 1986] </ref>. The Event Calculus of Kowalski and Sergot [1986] is one such formalism. In the Event Calculus, events initiate periods during which properties hold.

Reference-contexts: This can be axiomatised by substituting a qualitative version of trajectory for the definition of (11.1). A qualitative quantity space can be represented as an ordered set of landmark values <ref> [Kuipers, 1986] </ref>; those points in the corresponding quantitative space which are of interest for some reason. The continuously changing quantity in question can either be at one of the landmark values or between two adjacent ones.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the formalisms used for qualitative reasoning are weak when it comes to representing discrete change.

Acknowledgements Thanks to Bob Kowalski for making significant improvements to my earlier formulations of continuous change. Thanks also to Marek Sergot for valuable discussions on continuous change, especially in relation to the many tanks problem.
