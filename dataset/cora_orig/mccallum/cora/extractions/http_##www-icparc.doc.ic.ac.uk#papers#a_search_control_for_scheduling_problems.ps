Abstract: For a large class of scheduling problems which can be regarded as Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) we propose a search control on a hypergraph as an underlying structure. Using causal theories, based on the nature of constraints, we show that scheduling decisions can be realized as simple operations on hypergraphs. The proposed framework helps us to control the search for solutions to scheduling problems. If a hypergraph is reduced by using these operations to an edge-free hypergraph, the scheduling problem is solved without backtracking. Finally, we present some experimental results.

Reference-contexts: HYPERGRAPH AS A FRAMEWORK FOR SCHEDULING PROBLEMS The subquadrangles mentioned in the previous section enable efficient operations on a hyper-graph as an underlying structure of CSPs. To use these operations as scheduling decisions, an extension of the usual definition of hyper-graphs <ref> (see Berge, 1989) </ref> by adding a labeling to vertices is needed. Definition 3.1 (Hypergraph).

Reference-contexts: In <ref> (Dechter and Pearl, 1991) </ref> it is stated that causal theory relative to an ordering of indices 3 is a sufficient and necessary condition to de-scribe backtrack-freeness along this ordering.

SCHEDULING PROBLEMS AS CSPs 2.1 Scheduling Problems Scheduling problems <ref> (Fox and Sadah, 1990) </ref> are generally defined by two basic sets, a set of activities and a set of resources, with some constraints over them.

Each constraint specifies allowed combinations of values, one of each set. Finding a combination of values, namely a solution, which satisfies all constraints, is known to be an N P -complete problem. <p> f7; 8g, scope (C 3 ) = f1; 3g, scope (C 4 ) = f2; 4g, scope (C 5 ) = f1; 2; 5; 6g, scope (C 6 ) = f2; 3; 6; 7g. values of the set D i , we apply the efficient arc-consistency algorithm on this CSP <ref> (see Meseguer, 1989) </ref>. Example 2.5 (An arc-consistent CSP). Let = ((D 1 ; :::; D 8 ); fC 1 ; :::; C 6 g) be a CSP. The domains and the constraints with their scopes are shown in Table 1.

Reference-contexts: Since these variables are required to belong to a set with two elements, e.g., f"reduce to simple edge with white vertices", "reduce to simple edge with black vertices"g, the problem is N P -complete <ref> (see Reischuk, 1990) </ref>. Surprisingly, for a class of hypergraphs with at most two non-simple edges in every cycle a sequence of operations can be found efficiently, and hence, an ordering of indices to solve the scheduling problem without backtracking if such an ordering exists. <p> For two non-simple edges e i and e j in a cycle, accordingly to white and black vertices, one of the following inequalities is derived: v i + v j 1 or v i v j 1: This variant of integer programming is solved in polynomial time <ref> (see Reischuk, 1990) </ref>. Hypergraphs with this property are called 2-non-simple-edges hypergraphs.

Reference-contexts: A solution of the scheduling problem is an assignment of a start time and a resource for each activity such that all specified constraints are satisfied. We consider a large class of scheduling problems <ref> (Rodosek, 1993) </ref> where temporal and resource dependencies between any two activities are allowed. Definition 2.1 (Scheduling problem). <p> activities, i.e., 8a; b 2 A : (sr (a); sr (b)) 2 r (a; b); * any two activities do not run simultane ously on one resource, i.e., 8a; b 2 A : sr (a) = sr (b) ) The scheduling problems defined by this definition are N P -complete <ref> (see Rodosek, 1993) </ref>. Example 2.2 (A scheduling problem).

Reference-contexts: The first operation on hypergraphs removes an edge containing a lonely vertex: Operation 3.2 (Removing an edge with a lonely vertex). Input: A hypergraph (V; E; c) with a lonely vertex v 2 V . Output: The v-reduced hypergraph of (V; E; c). In <ref> (Rodosek, 1994) </ref> it is shown that Operation 3.2 preserves the solutions of an arc-consistent CSP where the constraints are sub-quadrangles: Lemma 3.3 Let be an arc-consistent CSP where the constraints are subquad-rangles, and let G be the hypergraph for .
