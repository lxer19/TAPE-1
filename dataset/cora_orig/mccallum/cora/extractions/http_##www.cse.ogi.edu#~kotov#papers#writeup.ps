Abstract: An observational study was carried out with student subjects from a programming class. The goal of the study was to understand the impact of different programming languages on the productivity of the students. Students used a language of their choice (C or SML) for the homeworks and recorded effort expended to complete the assignments. An automated infrastructure was created for homework submission. Data analysis showed that in one of the four programming homeworks students using a functional language (SML) were more productive than students using an imperative language (C) (p &lt; 0:05). There was no significant difference for the other three homeworks.

Reference-contexts: At this time, we have little understanding of the factors that influence productivity and quality of software development and interaction between them. A lot of experimental work is required to create the knowledge base that will allow us to start in-depth studies of such interactions <ref> [1] </ref>. The choice of programming language affects productivity of software development. To characterize the relationship between the language and productivity, Jones ranked programming languages with respect to their "level" [3]. Jones' "level" is inversely proportional to the size of the program in the language that implements some given functionality.

Reference-contexts: Such larger population is often referred to as "target population". As the literature on studies note, such scalability often presents significant difficulties, especially in the case of "captive subject" (class students) who may not represent any specific population <ref> [2] </ref>. Despite there shortcomings, the study brought along some benefits that are worth mentioning.

Reference-contexts: The choice of programming language affects productivity of software development. To characterize the relationship between the language and productivity, Jones ranked programming languages with respect to their "level" <ref> [3] </ref>. Jones' "level" is inversely proportional to the size of the program in the language that implements some given functionality. Program size is correlated with programming effort, and therefore productivity, but program length in lines of code (LOC) is not the principal factor affecting productivity.

Reference-contexts: As an incentive, students were offered 5 extra grade points for each homework they submitted along with the effort information. The class was structured and taught in such a way that the students could pick either C or SML <ref> [4] </ref> as a language for their homeworks. This resulted in a phenomenon that could be called "double self-selection" in the sense that the subjects who were not picked randomly were allowed to further select one of two experimental treatments. In the course of the class the students had seven homeworks.

Reference-contexts: This reduces the usefulness of the "language level". This study was aimed at comparing students' productivity while they were performing the same task using two different languages. Schneiderman <ref> [5] </ref> and Votta et. al [6] outlined difficulties in performing experiments with student subjects, but noted that sometimes such experiments are the only choice because of cost constraints. Such constraints dictated the design of this study.
