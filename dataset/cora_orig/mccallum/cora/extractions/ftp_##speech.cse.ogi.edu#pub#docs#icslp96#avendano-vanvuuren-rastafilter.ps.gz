Abstract: RASTA processing has proven to be a successful technique for channel normalization in automatic speech recognition (ASR). We present two approaches to the design of RASTA-like filters from training data. One consists of finding the solution to a constrained optimization problem on the feature time trajectories while the other uses Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Whereas LDA is often applied to one or a few frames of the feature vectors we apply LDA to feature time trajectories. Both approaches result in similar filters which are consistent with the ad hoc designed RASTA filter.

Reference-contexts: Some reasonable constraints may be implied by properties of the human hearing process and we have been relatively successful when incorporating them into ASR <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. On the other hand, it is hard to deny the power of real speech data. Thus, we support using the speech data, as long as they are used in a way to provide permanent and reusable knowledge. <p> The other two samples were taken from the corresponding speech of the NTIMIT database (telephone channel) and TIMIT recorded through a cellular telephone channel. Auditory frequency band trajectories for the three recordings were computed by a weighted sum of their short-term power spectrum as proposed in <ref> [1] </ref>. The logarithm of these trajectories was taken to produce x 0 (m; k), x 1 (m; k) and x 2 (m; k) respectively. The same design was applied to each critical band independently. <p> The results show that there exist common prop erties between them, pointing to the intrinsic characteristics of the speech signal and the relation to auditory models used in the past.

This is different from other LDA-based approaches (eg. [8]) that apply LDA to a feature vector or to a relatively short block of feature vectors. 3.2.

Reference-contexts: Interestingly, by using this constraint we found that the filters had very similar responses (i.e. band-pass with strong dc suppression and narrow pass-band) as the so called delta cepstrum processing <ref> [4] </ref>. A more reasonable constraint was found by not allowing the distance between the filter outputs y j (m; k) and the original uncor-rupted speech features x 0 (m; k) (see bottom of Fig. 1) to be large.

Reference-contexts: It is obvious that there are many common characteristics between the new filters, and with the original RASTA filter. It is interesting to notice the modulation frequency range which is consistently preserved by all techniques and its correspondence with the results obtained in recent perceptual experiments <ref> [6] </ref>. 5. Conclusions Two new approaches for deriving RASTA-like filters from training data were presented. The results show that there exist common prop erties between them, pointing to the intrinsic characteristics of the speech signal and the relation to auditory models used in the past.

Reference-contexts: In the current work we use two optimization techniques to design a set of RASTA filters from realistic noisy data. The first is a constrained optimization technique which uses the natural time-varying structure of the continuous speech data. The second technique is based on a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) <ref> [7] </ref> which uses phoneme-labeled speech data. The data used in both cases consisted of parallel speech recordings corrupted by different channels. 2. Filter Design by Constrained Optimization In this section we find a set of filters for channel normalization by constructing a constrained optimization program. <p> Scope In this paper we find a filter for each feature trajectory x (m; k) separately but it should be understood that our technique is much more general: * Our technique in principle extends to multivariate filtering or non-linear discriminants <ref> [7] </ref>. * It could allow for more than just the principal component of the LDA to be used. * It allows for causal or non-causal filter design. * It is not limited to any particular domain (e.g. since the aim was to remove linear distortions, the domain was the logarithmic critical
