Abstract: Broadcasting protocols can improve the efficiency of video on demand services by reducing the bandwidth required to transmit videos that are simultaneously watched by many viewers. We present here a polyharmonic broadcasting protocol that requires less bandwidth than the best extant protocols to achieve the same low maximum waiting time. We also show how to modify the protocol to accommodate very long videos without increasing the buffering capacity of the set-top box.

Reference-contexts: Many more efficient protocols have been proposed. They include Viswanathan and Imielinski's pyramid broadcasting protocol [8], Aggarwal, Wolf and Yu's permutation-based pyramid broadcasting protocol <ref> [1] </ref>, Hua and Sheu's skyscraper broadcasting protocol [5], Juhn and Tseng's harmonic broadcasting protocol [6] and its variants [7]. All these protocols share a similar organization. They divide each video into segments that are simultaneously broadcast on different data streams. <p> Figure 3 shows the bandwidth versus client waiting times for the harmonic and cautious harmonic broadcasting and compares them with those of pyramid broadcasting [8], the unconstrained version of permutation-based pyramid broadcasting <ref> [1] </ref> and skyscraper broadcasting with a maximum width of 52 [5]. Both harmonic broadcasting protocols emerge as clear winners as none of the three other protocols even approaches their performance.

One may then wonder whether harmonic broadcasting does not provide the minimum bandwidth required to guarantee a given maximum waiting time.

Reference-contexts: The overall consensus now is that the commercial deployment of VOD will have to wait until the cost of building and maintaining the required infrastructure can be significantly lowered. Broadcasting is one of several techniques that aim to reduce the cost of VOD <ref> [9] </ref>. It is clearly not a panacea as it only applies to videos that are likely to be watched by many viewers.
