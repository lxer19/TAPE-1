Abstract: To operate successfully in indoor environments, mobile robots must be able to localize themselves. Most current localization algorithms lack flexibility, autonomy, and often optimality, since they rely on a human to determine what aspects of the sensor data to use in localization (e.g., what landmarks to use). This paper describes a learning algorithm, called BaLL, that enables mobile robots to learn what features/landmarks are best suited for localization, and also to train artificial neural networks for extracting them from the sensor data. A rigorous Bayesian analysis of probabilistic localization is presented, which produces a rational argument for evaluating features, for selecting them optimally, and for training the networks that approximate the optimal solution. In a systematic experimental study, BaLL outperforms two other recent approaches to mobile robot localization.

Reference-contexts: For example, many of the landmark-based approaches reviewed in Borenstein, Everett, and Feng (1996) require artificial landmarks such as bar-code reflectors (Everett et al., 1994), reflecting tape, ultrasonic beacons, or visual patterns that are easy to recognize, such as black rectangles with white dots <ref> (Borenstein, 1987) </ref>. Some recent approaches use more natural landmarks that do not require modifications of the environment.

Reference-contexts: What landmarks are best suited for mobile robot localization? Can a robot learn its own sets of features, can it define its own landmarks for 2 localization, and can it learn optimal features? The problem of learning the right landmarks has been recognized as a significant scientific problem in robotics <ref> (Borenstein, Everett, & Feng, 1996) </ref>, artificial intelligence (Greiner & Isukapalli, 1994), and in cognitive science (Chown, Kaplan, & Kortenkamp, 1995). Few localization algorithms enable a robot to learn features or to define its own landmarks. <p> Additionally, humans might be fooled by introspection. Since the human sensory apparatus differs from that of mobile robots, features that appear appropriate for human orientation are not necessarily appropriate for robots. These principal deficiencies are shared by most existing localization approaches <ref> (Borenstein, Everett, & Feng, 1996) </ref>. This paper presents an algorithm, called BaLL (short for Bayesian landmark learning), that lets a robot learn such features, along with routines for extracting them from sensory data. Features are computed by artificial neural networks that map sensor data to a lower- dimensional feature space. <p> The majority of localization approaches described in the literature assumes that the map is given <ref> (Borenstein, Everett, & Feng, 1996) </ref>. The probability P (f j~) can also be learned from examples.

Reference-contexts: sets of features, can it define its own landmarks for 2 localization, and can it learn optimal features? The problem of learning the right landmarks has been recognized as a significant scientific problem in robotics (Borenstein, Everett, & Feng, 1996), artificial intelligence (Greiner & Isukapalli, 1994), and in cognitive science <ref> (Chown, Kaplan, & Kortenkamp, 1995) </ref>. Few localization algorithms enable a robot to learn features or to define its own landmarks. Instead, they rely on static, hand-coded sets of features for localization, which has three principle disadvantages: 1. Lack of flexibility.

Reference-contexts: Acting. When the robot executes an action command, its internal belief is updated accordingly. Since robot motion is inaccurate due to slippage and drift, it increases the robot's uncertainty. The derivation of the probabilistic model relies on the assumption that the robot operates in a partially observable Markov environment <ref> (Chung, 1960) </ref> in which the only state is the location of the robot. In other words, the Markov assumption states that noise in perception and control is independent of noise at previous points in time.

Reference-contexts: The corresponding localization problem is called position tracking. Conversely, if the robot has no initial knowledge about its position, Bel prior (~ (0) ) is a uniform distribution. Here the corresponding localization problem is called self localization, global localization, or the kidnapped robot problem <ref> (Engelson, 1994) </ref>, a task that is significantly more difficult than position tracking. Sensor queries and actions change the robot's internal belief.

Reference-contexts: A diverse variety of objects and spatial configurations have been used as landmarks. For example, many of the landmark-based approaches reviewed in Borenstein, Everett, and Feng (1996) require artificial landmarks such as bar-code reflectors <ref> (Everett et al., 1994) </ref>, reflecting tape, ultrasonic beacons, or visual patterns that are easy to recognize, such as black rectangles with white dots (Borenstein, 1987). Some recent approaches use more natural landmarks that do not require modifications of the environment.

Reference-contexts: There are several ways to reduce the complexity of learning: 16 1. Instead of training all networks in parallel, they can also be trained one after another, similar to the way units are trained one after another in the cascade correlation algorithm <ref> (Fahlman & Lebiere, 1989) </ref>. Sequential training would reduce worst-case exponential to linear complexity, since networks are trained one after another, which requires O (N nK 3 ) time. 2. Compact representations for P (f j~) and Bel (~) can reduce the complexity significantly.

Reference-contexts: robot localization? Can a robot learn its own sets of features, can it define its own landmarks for 2 localization, and can it learn optimal features? The problem of learning the right landmarks has been recognized as a significant scientific problem in robotics (Borenstein, Everett, & Feng, 1996), artificial intelligence <ref> (Greiner & Isukapalli, 1994) </ref>, and in cognitive science (Chown, Kaplan, & Kortenkamp, 1995). Few localization algorithms enable a robot to learn features or to define its own landmarks. Instead, they rely on static, hand-coded sets of features for localization, which has three principle disadvantages: 1. Lack of flexibility. <p> By training the networks so as to minimize this error, the robot learns features that directly minimize the quantity of interest in mobile robot localization <ref> (see also Greiner & Isukapalli, 1994) </ref>. We conjecture that the learning approach proposed here is more flexible than static approaches to mobile robot localization, since BaLL can automatically adapt to the particular environment, the robot, and its sensors.

Reference-contexts: Below, we will train networks for different prior beliefs characterized by different entropies (i.e., degrees of uncertainty). The gradient descent update is repeated until one reaches a termination criterion (e.g., early stopping using a cross-validation set or pseudo- convergence of E posterior ), as in regular backpropagation <ref> (Hertz, Krogh, & Palmer, 1991) </ref>. 3 14 Table 2. BaLL, the algorithm for learning neural network filters . Input: Data set X = fhs k ; ~ k i j k = 1; : : : ; Kg, prior belief Bel prior (~). <p> These patterns are fitted using multiple epochs of regular backpropagation. This algorithm approximates gradient descent, but it reduces the complexity by a constant factor. In addition, modifications such as online learning, stochastic gradient descent, or higher- order methods such as momentum or conjugate gradient methods <ref> (Hertz, Krogh, & Palmer, 1991) </ref> yield further speedup. Little is currently known about principal complexity bounds that would apply here. As noted above, learning can be done offline and is only done once. <p> Networks were trained using a learning rate of 0.0001, a momentum of 0.9, and a version of conjugate gradient descent <ref> (Hertz, Krogh, & Palmer, 1991) </ref>. These modifications of the basic algorithm were exclusively adopted to reduce the overall training time, but an initial comparison using the unmodified algorithm (see Table 2) gave statistically indistinguishable 20 results.

Reference-contexts: The robot knows with high accuracy where it is. Notice that the algorithm derived in this paper is a general instance of an updating algorithm for a partially observable Markov chain. For example, it subsumes Kalman filters <ref> (Kalman, 1960) </ref> when applied mobile robot localization (Smith, Self, & Cheeseman, 1990; Leonard, Durrant-Whyte, & Cox, 1992). It also subsumes hidden Markov models (Rabiner, 1989) if robot location is the only state in the environment, as assumed here and elsewhere.

Reference-contexts: Localization with ceiling lights. Various research teams have successfully used ceiling lights as landmarks, including HelpMate Robotics, which has built a landmark commercial service robot application that has been deployed in hospitals world wide <ref> (King & Weiman, 1990) </ref>. HelpMate's navigation system is extremely reliable. In our building, ceiling lights are easy to recognize, stationary, and rarely blocked by obstacles, making them prime candidate landmarks for mobile robot localization. <p> For example, the approaches of Kortenkamp and Weymouth (1994) and Mataric (1990) use certain gateways, doors, walls, and other vertical objects to determine the robot's position, and the Helpmate robot uses ceiling lights to position itself <ref> (King & Weiman, 1990) </ref>. The approaches reported in Collet and Cartwright (1985) and Wolfart, Fisher, and Walker (1995) use dark/bright regions and vertical edges as landmarks. These are just a few representative examples of many different landmarks used for localization.

Reference-contexts: These are just a few representative examples of many different landmarks used for localization. Map matching, which comprises a second, not quite as popular family of approaches to localization, converts sensor data to metric maps of the surrounding environment, such as occupancy grids <ref> (Moravec, 1988) </ref> or maps of geometric features such as lines. The sensor map is then matched to a global map, which might have been learned or provided by hand (Cox, 1991; Rencken, 1993; Schiele & Crowley, 1994; Thrun, 1993; Thrun, in press; Yamauchi & Beer, 1996; Yamauchi & Langley, 1997).

Reference-contexts: Data collection During data collection, the robot moved autonomously at approximately 15 cm/sec, controlled by our local obstacle avoidance and navigation routines <ref> (Fox, Burgard, & Thrun, 1996) </ref>. In 12 separate runs, a total of 9,815 sensor snapshots were collected (228 MB raw data). The data was recorded using three different pointing directions for the robot's camera: 1. <p> Most of our data was collected close to the center of the corridor. Consequently, the networks and the map P (f j~) are specialized to our navigation algorithms <ref> (Thrun et al., 1996) </ref>. This is similar to work by others (Kuipers & Byun, 1988; Kuipers & Byun, 1991; Mataric, 19 1990), whose definition of a landmark also requires that the robot use a particular navigation algorithm that makes it stay at a certain proximity to obstacles. <p> The error of these automatically derived position labels was significantly lower than the tolerance threshold of our existing navigation software <ref> (Thrun et al., 1996) </ref>. 5.1.3. Preprocessing In all our runs, images were preprocessed to eliminate some of the daytime- and view- dependent variations and to reduce the dimensionality of the data. First, the pixel mean and variance were normalized in each image. <p> Data set D-1 D-2 D-3 doors 8.3%1.1% 1.4%1.5% ceiling lights 15.6%1.4% BaLL, n = 1 14.9%1.3% 14.2%1.6% 21.0%1.7% BaLL, n = 2 33.5%1.9% 36.7%1.9% 34.5%2.0% BaLL, n = 3 39.7%2.0% 36.3%2.3% 41.5%1.8% BaLL, n = 4 41.7%2.5% 36.7%1.9% 42.9%1.6% this article <ref> (Thrun, 1996) </ref>, the output of the networks is largely uncorrelated, demonstrating that different, non-redundant features are extracted by the different networks. 5.2.3. Multiple neural networks and different uncertainty in training and testing In a third experiment, we investigated BaLL's performance when trained for one particular uncertainty but tested under another.

Reference-contexts: P (f j~) can be estimated from data. The mathematically inclined reader may notice that the use of (s) instead of s is mathematically justified only if is a sufficient statistic <ref> (Vapnik, 1982) </ref> for estimating locationotherwise, all approaches that filter sensor data may yield sub-optimal results (by ignoring important sensor information).
