Abstract: Interactive stereoscopic images can be viewed on a graphics workstation by producing side-by-side images and viewing through a simple mirror device. However, it is important that the viewing device have pairs of adjustable nonparallel mirrors so large windows can be viewed without the human's sightlines needing to diverge, or "look wall-eyed". Transformations to produce the correct images for this viewing method are described. Previous work applied to the case where both left and right images were to be superimposed and multiplexed in the same region of the screen, often called anaglyphs. Such cases are adequately handled by a translation and an off-axis perspective transformation. The same kind of transformation can be used with a parallel-mirror device, but such devices have practical limitations. This paper shows that nonparallel mirrors require a somewhat more complicated transformation involving scene rotations as well. Derivation of the correct angle of rotation is the main difficulty in computing this transformation. The transformation can be implemented by a sequence of graphics library procedures. Advantages and disadvantages of nonparallel mirror methods are discussed. fl Presented at SPIE Conference on Visual Data Exploration and Analysis, Vol. 1278, San Jose, CA, Feb. 1994.

Reference-contexts: Such images are often called anaglyphs. In one technique the images are orthogonally polarized, and in the other certain red and green colors are used <ref> [HM85, RA90, FDFH90, Tes90, Hod92] </ref>. A method based on side-by-side images is less commonly used, but has certain advantages. The latter method is studied in this paper. Autostereograms are pairs of images that are intended for viewing side-by-side with little or no special equipment.

Currently, the entire monitor must be put in a special mode to display multiplexed images. Viewing with special glasses, whether color or polarized, is generally regarded as slightly stressful and uncomfortable.

Reference-contexts: Experience and earlier experiments have shown that incorrect projections make it difficult for the eyes (brain, actually) to fuse a pair of stereo images. Hodges and McAllister analytically studied artifacts due to the use of a simplified, but slightly incorrect, projection method, the so-called "rotation method" <ref> [HM90] </ref>. This study was based on the geometry for parallel sight lines (assuming the eyes are converging at infinity), which is applicable to anaglyphic images. Their findings confirmed earlier experimental studies. (See cited paper for further bibliography.) This paper analyses the projection transformations needed for bent-sightline viewing with nonparallel mirrors.
