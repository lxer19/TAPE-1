Abstract: Text coherence is a difficult problem in natural language processing. A text is considered to be coherent when sentences follow logically one after the other. In this paper we describe a computational method that provides an explanation why a text is coherent. By providing such an explanation, one can infer a number of assertions unstated in a text. Our computational method is based on a parallel marker-propagation algorithm that is independent of the size of the knowledge base. We assume that the sentences have been already syntactically parsed and relations between verbs and their grammatical cases were established. At the heart of our system there is a semantic knowledge base constructed on top of a portion of the WordNet linguistic database. The algorithm identifies paths in the knowledge base between the concepts of one clause and the concepts of the following clause. Some paths are eliminated when they don't satisfy the syntactic and semantic constraints of the text. This paper presents the structure of the system, the marker-propagation algorithm, and results that show a large degree of parallelism.

Reference-contexts: 1 The problem of text coherence A text is considered to be coherent when it is logically connected and intelligible. The logical connections are semantic relations between concepts. Some of the coherence relations between clauses are elaboration, circumstance, background, justify, causation, etc. Text coherence has been addressed by <ref> [Alt85] </ref>, [Hob85], [Hov93], [MTh88] among others. In this paper we consider only one aspect of the coherence problem, namely the relationship between two clauses within a discourse segment. In particular, we provide a computational method for finding a semantic path between two clauses.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the path filtering mechanism is supported by (1) guiding marker propagations and (2) checking case constraints. Other work in marker propagation lack both these features. The markers we used are considerably more complex then spreading activation markers, proposed in [Fah79], <ref> [Cha86] </ref>, [Hen88] for example. Our markers have fields for case constraints, synchronization with other markers, and propagation rules. We think that by allowing the user to program the marker fields is a clear advantage.
