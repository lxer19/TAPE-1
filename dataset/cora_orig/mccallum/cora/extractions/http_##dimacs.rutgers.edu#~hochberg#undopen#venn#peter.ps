Abstract: In [3,4], using graph theory, we developed procedures for the construction of Venn diagrams. Utilizing these procedures with some new methods that we introduce here, we determine the number of simple, reducible spherical Venn diagrams on five sets. In so doing, we obtain examples of Venn diagrams which yield answers to several problems and conjectures of Grnbaum. Among others we construct a simple, reducible Venn diagram with five congruent ellipses. We show that this diagram is unique on the sphere and produces two different plane diagrams. This corrects some erroneous statements that started with John Venn more than a century ago in 1880 and have been repeated frequently by others since then.

Reference-contexts: The first four examples of irreducible Venn diagrams with five congruent ellipses were obtained by Grnbaum [7], a nonsimple one by Schwenk [10], and an another irreducible one by the authors and K. B. Chilakamarri <ref> [3] </ref>. Those examples together with the two diagrams constructed here, finally correct the error which due to Venn and perpetuated by Grnbaum in the simple, reducible case. Grnbaum says [6]: "In [11, 12], Venn gave examples of Venn diagrams with four ellipses. <p> Probably the same is true without the assumption of simplicity." For a more detailed history of this problem see [9]. 2. Definitions and Notation To make this paper self contained we list the definitions we need, and the theorems that were proved in <ref> [3] </ref> and [6] which are used in this paper. We use graph theory throughout; for terminology the reader is referred to [1] or any other standard book on graph theory. The infinite face of a planar graph is called the outer face . <p> The infinite face of a planar graph is called the outer face . A face with n edges will be called an n-face , and n is the size of the face. A planar graph is maximal bipartite if and only if all its faces are 4-faces <ref> [3] </ref>. We follow Grnbaum [6] in the terminology of Venn diagrams. A Venn diagram (or n-Venn diagram) in the plane is a collection of simple closed Jordan curves = -C ,C ,...,C - such that each of the 1 2 n 2 sets X X ... <p> The graphs V ( ) and D ( ) are both planar graphs. An important observation is that if forms a simple Venn diagram, then each face of D ( ) is a quadrilateral, and hence D ( ) is a maximal bipartite planar graph. In <ref> [3] </ref> we proved that: a simple Venn diagram with fl fl 3 is 3-connected, and a simple Venn graph D ( ) is 3-connected if fl fl 3. Grnbaum stated the following [6]: "It is not hard to prove that if a Venn diagram is convex then it is exposed. <p> Conjecture 3.3 Every convex Venn diagram with five curves is isomorphic to one with five congruent ellipses. Problem 3.4 Is every simple Venn diagram of the same class as some exposed diagram, or even some convex diagram? We showed in <ref> [3] </ref> that, for n &lt; 5, every simple Venn diagram is in the same class as some simple convex (and consequently, exposed) diagram; and for n &gt; 5, there exist simple Venn diagrams that are not in the same class as any simple exposed or convex diagram. <p> Consequently, the case n = 5 deserves special consideration. In <ref> [3] </ref> in the same class as any convex diagram. 4. Enumeration of Venn Diagrams on 5 curves In this section we will enumerate simple, reducible spherical Venn diagrams with five curves and we also will enumerate nonisomorphic convex, simple, reducible, Venn diagrams in the plane. <p> First we prove (i). Since every reducible n-Venn diagram can be obtained from an (n-1)-Venn diagram with the addition of a suitable curve, to prove (i) it is enough to find all curves that extend all 4-Venn diagrams. We proved in <ref> [3] </ref> that there exists only one spherical 4-Venn diagram, so we need only find all curves that extend this diagram. <p> Proof We first determine all Hamiltonian cycles of a planar drawing of the Venn graph with a specified outer face, up to rotational symmetry in the plane. Since the Venn graph is 3-connected <ref> [3] </ref>, Whitney's Theorem [14] guarantees a unique embedding in the plane once the outer face is specified. We then identify those cycles which are equivalent under spherical symmetry, using the fact that the two faces of the Venn graph containing only vertices of degree 4 are equivalent on the sphere. <p> Figures 5.a and 5.b show twelve distinct counterexamples for Grnbaum's Conjecture 3.2. Another one was published in <ref> [3] </ref>, and in the paper [5] we will show that there are no more. All of the diagrams except the first two give a counterexample to Grnbaum's Conjecture 3.3. These diagrams are closely related to some other conjectures and problems of Grnbaum [8] that we have not discussed here.

Reference-contexts: This completes the proof of Theorem 4.1. 5. Answers to Grnbaum's problems and conjectures Theorem 4.1 answers Grnbaum's Problem 3.1 on the sphere in the case of reducible, simple Venn diagrams, and also in the plane for convex, simple, reducible Venn diagrams. In a forthcoming paper <ref> [5] </ref> we plan to answer this problem fully on the sphere, and for convex Venn diagrams on the plane. <p> Figures 5.a and 5.b show twelve distinct counterexamples for Grnbaum's Conjecture 3.2. Another one was published in [3], and in the paper <ref> [5] </ref> we will show that there are no more. All of the diagrams except the first two give a counterexample to Grnbaum's Conjecture 3.3. These diagrams are closely related to some other conjectures and problems of Grnbaum [8] that we have not discussed here. <p> In Figure 4 we show five simple, reducible 5-Venn diagrams that are not in the same class as any convex diagram. In <ref> [5] </ref> we also will show that, in contrast to the reducible case, every convex, irreducible, simple Venn diagram is isomorphic to one with five congruent ellipses. Finally, our greatest surprise was in Figure 6: two simple, reducible 5-Venn diagrams with five congruent ellipses, which were supposed not to exist.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction This paper is inspired by Grnbaum's conjectures and problems on simple Venn diagrams <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> In computerized geometric and solid modeling, algorithms are known only for convex diagrams. Therefore the characterizations of those diagrams are no longer merely nice curiosities of geometry. In Section 2, the exact definitions used in this paper are given. Here, we also state the facts from [3,4], and <ref> [6] </ref> which are needed for our results. In Section 3, we list those questions of Grnbaum which we are able to answer or partially answer. <p> B. Chilakamarri [3]. Those examples together with the two diagrams constructed here, finally correct the error which due to Venn and perpetuated by Grnbaum in the simple, reducible case. Grnbaum says <ref> [6] </ref>: "In [11, 12], Venn gave examples of Venn diagrams with four ellipses. However, he mistakenly stated that no five ellipses can form a Venn diagram; indeed, it takes only a little patience to verify that the five congruent ellipses in each part of [the figure] form a Venn diagram. <p> Probably the same is true without the assumption of simplicity." For a more detailed history of this problem see [9]. 2. Definitions and Notation To make this paper self contained we list the definitions we need, and the theorems that were proved in [3] and <ref> [6] </ref> which are used in this paper. We use graph theory throughout; for terminology the reader is referred to [1] or any other standard book on graph theory. The infinite face of a planar graph is called the outer face . <p> A face with n edges will be called an n-face , and n is the size of the face. A planar graph is maximal bipartite if and only if all its faces are 4-faces [3]. We follow Grnbaum <ref> [6] </ref> in the terminology of Venn diagrams. A Venn diagram (or n-Venn diagram) in the plane is a collection of simple closed Jordan curves = -C ,C ,...,C - such that each of the 1 2 n 2 sets X X ... <p> In [3] we proved that: a simple Venn diagram with fl fl 3 is 3-connected, and a simple Venn graph D ( ) is 3-connected if fl fl 3. Grnbaum stated the following <ref> [6] </ref>: "It is not hard to prove that if a Venn diagram is convex then it is exposed. <p> An example of a forbidden configuration is shown in 5 3. Conjectures and Problems Posed by Grnbaum Grnbaum <ref> [6] </ref> raised several problems and conjectures dealing with the number of Venn diagrams and the existence of certain kinds of Venn diagrams. We will mention those problems and conjectures which we are able to answer or partially answer. <p> Problem 3.1 It is not known how many types of simple Venn diagrams exist with five (or more) curves. Conjecture 3.2 Every simple and convex Venn diagram with five curves is isomorphic to one of the diagrams in Figure 7 of <ref> [6] </ref>. Conjecture 3.3 Every convex Venn diagram with five curves is isomorphic to one with five congruent ellipses. <p> To prove (iii), we first need to recall the fact from Section 2 that a co nvex drawing of a Venn diagram in the plane must be exposed <ref> [6] </ref>. It follows immediately that distinct spherical Venn diagrams cannot have isomorphic drawings in the plane. In Figure 3 we marked the 5-faces of each diagram with an asterisk or with a number.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we prove that there are exactly two simple, reducible Venn diagrams with five congruent ellipses, and show that they are in the same class.

B. Chilakamarri [3]. Those examples together with the two diagrams constructed here, finally correct the error which due to Venn and perpetuated by Grnbaum in the simple, reducible case. <p> Venn's erroneous assertion was repeated -- unchecked and unchallenged -- by several authors for almost a century. The first Venn diagram 1 of five ellipses ... was published only in 1975 <ref> [7] </ref>; a non-simple example ... was found by Schwenk [10].

Reference-contexts: Another one was published in [3], and in the paper [5] we will show that there are no more. All of the diagrams except the first two give a counterexample to Grnbaum's Conjecture 3.3. These diagrams are closely related to some other conjectures and problems of Grnbaum <ref> [8] </ref> that we have not discussed here. That two of the diagrams in diagram "C-1" was a bigger surprise than the diagram "Diamond", since the obstacle in "C-1" is not the number of intersections of two curves, but the topological relation of three curves.

Using Euler's theorem and the fact that two ellipses can intersect in no more than four points, it follows easily (by an argument similar to the one concerning circles) that there can be no Venn diagrams with six or more ellipses.

Since the Venn graph is 3-connected [3], Whitney's Theorem <ref> [14] </ref> guarantees a unique embedding in the plane once the outer face is specified. We then identify those cycles which are equivalent under spherical symmetry, using the fact that the two faces of the Venn graph containing only vertices of degree 4 are equivalent on the sphere.
