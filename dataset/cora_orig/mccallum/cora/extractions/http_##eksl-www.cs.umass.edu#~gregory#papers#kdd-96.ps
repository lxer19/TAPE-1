Abstract: We approach the problem of automated knowledge discovery from an empirical perspective. We are developing an artificial agent, called the Scientist's Empirical Assistant (SEA), that discovers the structure of the world by formulating hypotheses and testing them through controlled experimentation. SEA is a mixed-initiative system which supports a human scientist in common scientific activities, such as reasoning about a problem, formulating and testing hypotheses, running experiments, and keeping records of the results. SEA uses planning and heuristic reasoning to search a space of hypotheses for those which accurately reflect the observed behavior of the world. It relies heavily on the user's expert knowledge of the domain to guide the planner toward the most appropriate course of action. We discuss the design of SEA through the presentation of an annotated example. The example application is a non-trivial, open scientific problem from a real-world domain. While we cannot claim that SEA achieves any novel discoveries, its results are suprising given the simplicity of the design.

Reference-contexts: SEA uses a partial-hierarchical planning mechanism to guide its search through a space of hypotheses [3,4,7]. SEA's planner was originally developed for a similar agent, 1 the Assistant for Intelligent Data Exploration (AIDE) <ref> [1] </ref>. AIDE works with a user to discover the structure of a dataset using exploratory statistical procedures. Many of its plans are relevant to SEA's task, and we expect to eventually integrate the two systems. The planner selects plans from SEA's plan library to match posted empirical goals.

Reference-contexts: If variables are defined with respect to a simulator, SEA can automatically instrument and run experiments, using the facilities provided by the Common Lisp Instrumentation Package (CLIP) <ref> [2] </ref>. CLIP gathers experiment data from a simulation given (1) a set of "alligator clips" to interesting simulation variables and (2) a predefined experiment plan. This information is defined explicitly in a CLIP file.
