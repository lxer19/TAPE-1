Abstract: JANUS is a multi-lingual speech-to-speech translation system, which has been designed to translate spontaneous spoken language in a limited domain. In this paper, we describe our recent preliminary efforts to expand the domain of coverage of the system from the rather limited Appointment Scheduling domain, to the much richer Travel Planning domain. We compare the two domains in terms of out-of-vocabulary rates and linguistic complexity. We discuss the challenges that these differences impose on our translation system and some planned changes in the design of the system. Initial evaluations on Travel Planning data are also presented.

Speech translation in the JANUS system is guided by the general principle that spoken utterances can be analyzed and translated as a sequential collection of semantic dialogue units (SDUs), each of which roughly corresponds to a speech-act. SDUs are semantically coherent pieces of information.

Reference-contexts: Our experience has been that, for limited domains, 60% to 80% coverage can be achieved in a few months with semantic grammars. In order to assess the overall effectiveness of the translation system, we developed a detailed end-to-end evaluation procedure <ref> [7] </ref>. We evaluate the translation modules on both transcribed and speech recognized input. The evaluation of transcribed input allows us to assess how well our translation modules would function with "perfect" speech recognition.

Reference-contexts: The grammar rules that correspond to the correct parse are then added to the appropriate sub-domain grammar. This approach is similar to one proposed by Rayner and Samuelsson <ref> [8] </ref> for tailoring a large grammar to a given corpus. Conclusions In this paper we described our plans for extending the JANUS speech-to-speech translation system from the Appointment Scheduling domain to a broader domain, Travel Planning, which has a rich sub-domain structure.
