Title: ReAligner: A Program for Refining DNA Sequence Multi-Alignments  
Author: Eric L. Anson and Eugene W. Myers 
Abstract: We present a round-robin realignment algorithm that improves a potentially crude initial alignment of an assembled collection of DNA sequence fragments, as might, for example, be output by a typical fragment assembly program. The algorithm uses a weighted combination of two scoring schemes to achieve superior multi-alignments, and employs a banded dynamic programming variation to achieve a running time that is linear in the amount of sequence in the data set. We demonstrate that the algorithm improves upon the alignments produced by other assembly programs in a series of empirical experiments on simulated data. Finally, we present a pair of programs embodying the algorithms that are available from the Web site: ftp://ftp.cs.arizona.edu/realigner

Reference-contexts: In plain words, a multi-alignment is a rectangular array such that removing dashes from row i leaves sequence S i for each i 2 <ref> [1; k] </ref>, and every column has at least one sequence symbol in it. <p> For example, realigning a multi-alignment involving 1,200,000 basepairs of fragment data took 77.5 seconds on a Dec AlphaStation 200 4/233. 2 The Algorithm The round-robin technique was first introduced in the context of aligning sequences of proteins <ref> [1] </ref>. When used in this context, such iterative techniques generally do not perform as well as progressive alignment or hidden Markov model [7] approaches. But surprisingly in the context of DNA sequencing the method gives the best results with the greatest efficiency.

Reference-contexts: In some cases this score improves while the number of miscalls remains roughly the same. What is happening in these case is that the alignment improves the evidence that the given consensus symbol is indeed correct, in say, the sense of the Church-Waterman statistic <ref> [2] </ref>. For example, in Figure 5 a portion of a CAP2 multi-alignment at left was improved by ReAligner to the portion at right.

Reference-contexts: This strategy can be traced to a 1984 paper of Waterman and Perlwitz [9], and has been implemented, with numerous variations on the basic theme, by many investigators, e.g., <ref> [4, 8, 3, 5] </ref>. The most common variations require either O (k 3 n 2 ) or O (k 2 n 2 ) time.

Reference-contexts: Recall that we considered twelve data sets characterized by coverage C and average error rate *. The experiments involve three assemblers: CAP2: CAP2 by Xiaoqui Huang of Michigan Technological Univer sity. <ref> [6] </ref> FAK3.12: FAKII Version 3.12, an earlier version of our assembly suite using a window-sweep heuristic to refine its layout alignment. FAK.MST: FAK II Version 4.1, our current assembler, with round-robin refinement turned off. That is, the multi-alignment is just the one produced by merging pairwise alignments as described earlier.
