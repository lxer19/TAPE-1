Abstract: 1 This work is sponsored by DARPA under Fort Huachuca Contract No. DABT-63-92-C-0052 Abstract: In this paper we will introduce the use of dynamic vector force fields as a means of moving parts between work cells on an Intelligent Motion Surface (IMS). The idea is to put a force field around a part and move the force field in a continuous or discrete way, dragging the part along with the field. Here, we are not interested in determining in what stable position the part finds itself after the movement, but rather, we are interested in deriving the capture condition in order to guarantee that the part will not be lost during the movement. We will derive a realistic and accurate model of the movement of dynamic vector force fields taking into account the discrete placement of the micro-manipulators on the IMS. Using this model, we will show how dynamic vector force fields can be implemented by analyzing the special case of a squeeze vector force field moving a part (assumed to be a particle) along a straight line path. Dynamic control algorithms considering the discrete nature of the IMS have not yet been explored by the research community and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a sensorless manipulation strategy for moving parts on an IMS is derived taking into account the discrete placement of the micro-manipulators and the dynamics of the part.
