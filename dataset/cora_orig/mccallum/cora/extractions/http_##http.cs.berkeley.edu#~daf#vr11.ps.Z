Title: Primitives, Perceptual Organization and Object Recognition

Abstract: We argue that any computational theory of object recognition should explain how to decide what is to be recognized and how to recognize objects at the level of abstract categories. We show that several current theories perform poorly by these criteria and propose that object representation must be in terms of the spatial relationships between stylized primitives, while the fundamental process of recognition is to assemble these primitives from image evidence, a version of perceptual organization. We illustrate our approach with programs aimed at finding people and horses in pictures, and discuss the role of learning in the corresponding recognition process.

"But we seem to have no other." |Ivy Compton-Burnett, Manservant and Maidservant

Reference-contexts: In particular, while depth information may disambiguate some segmentation problems, the absence of depth information is not a significant source of difficulties in constructing representations. Object recognition programs that use laser range finder information are no more effective than those that use single images (a recent review appears in <ref> [ Arman and Aggarwal, 1993 ] </ref> ), and, of course, people have no problem recognizing objects in a single black-and-white photograph. A representation of an object as a series of pictures has the advantage that it is easy to obtain, and requires no theory of 3D inference.

But, whether mathematically proven, empirically established, or even intuitively assumed, the correspondence between shape and image primitives is a prerequisite to developing useful grouping strategies. An overly strict implementation of this principle, however, is dangerous.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the proof of this result is constructive: in other words, the equation of the surface can be recovered from the equation of its outline. Likewise, although it is not a priori obvious (or necessarily true) that generalized cylinders (GCs) as defined originally by Binford <ref> [ Binford, 1971 ] </ref> project onto ribbons (i.e., two-dimensional generalized cylinders), the relationship between certain subclasses of GCs and their silhouettes can be ascertained. Specifically, the silhouette of a solid of revolution observed under orthographic or spherical projection is bi-laterally symmetric.

Reference-contexts: The test images recovered contain horses in a wide range of aspects; one control image contains an animal that might reasonably pass for a horse. 29 are present. Statistical learning theory <ref> [ Vapnik, 1996; Devroye et al., 1996 ] </ref> , whose goal is to determine which measurements in a mass of detail are cogent and distinctive, provides a rigorous and principled mechanism for these processes. The statistical view of learning is well developed, powerful and relatively complete, but abstract.

The operator is performing the difficult tasks of deciding that an object is (a) different from those in the modelbase and (b) interesting; no current program can do so.

The strength of the link between a primitive and its silhouette depends of course on the 17 primitive under consideration.

Outlines of curved surfaces present difficulties, because occluding contours from different viewpoints involve different surface points, so that correspondences are meaningless (see, however, <ref> [ Kriegman and Ponce, 1990; Sullivan et al., 1994 ] </ref> for the case of objects represented by algebraic surfaces).

Reference-contexts: Electrophysiological studies in monkeys have recorded cells whose response is selective for object and viewpoint for bent wire objects and for amoebas, but where the viewpoint dependence of the response declines for familiar objects <ref> [ Logothetis et al., 1994a ] </ref> . <p> The process of transformation is used to account for viewpoint-dependence effects in observing amoebas or wire objects. The mechanism that associates images with views is taken to benefit from large numbers of views, explaining the absence of viewpoint dependence of familiar objects <ref> [ Bulthoff et al., 1994; Logothetis et al., 1994a ] </ref> .

The argument that the absence of viewpoint effects in recognizing familiar objects occurs because these objects have been seen from many poses <ref> [ Bulthoff et al., 1994; Logothetis et al., 1994a ] </ref> is particularly unfortunate in this respect, because it requires that many views of each particular instance of a familiar object have been seen [ Biederman and Gerhardstein, 1993 ] .

Reference-contexts: Although attractive, this approach presents several profound conceptual difficulties: * It is uncertain what shapes are to be used as primitives. Shapes as diverse as solids bounded by superquadric <ref> [ Barr, 1981; Pentland, 1986; Bajcsy and Solina, 1987 ] </ref> or algebraic surfaces [ Kriegman and Ponce, 1990; Taubin and Cooper, 1992; Sullivan et al., 1994; Forsyth, 1996 ] , and many different types of generalized cylinders [ Binford, 1971; Nevatia and Binford, 1977; Brooks, 1981; Ponce et al., 1989; Liu <p> For example, a minimum-description-length criterion has been used to merge local superquadric fits into a global object description <ref> [ Pentland, 1986 ] </ref> , and objects can be segmented at concavities [ Hoffman and Richards, 1984 ] , or at the singularities of some image or object description process such as the Blum transform in two dimensions [ Blum, 1967; Zhu and Yuille, 1995 ] or generalized cylinders in three <p> Of course, not every primitive will project onto a simple shape: for example, we are not aware of any special properties of the projections of the popular superquadric primitives <ref> [ Bajcsy and Solina, 1987; Barr, 1981; Pentland, 1986 ] </ref> . But, whether mathematically proven, empirically established, or even intuitively assumed, the correspondence between shape and image primitives is a prerequisite to developing useful grouping strategies. An overly strict implementation of this principle, however, is dangerous.

Reference-contexts: People can recognize objects at a level roughly corresponding to Rosch's basic categories (reviewed in <ref> [ Rosch, 1988 ] </ref> ): You would recognize the chair I am sitting right now as a chair, whether you had seen this particular chair before or not.

Reference-contexts: This has some obvious advantages, which made it a popular early theory: for example it does not require the detection and matching of point-like features. In addition, matched filtering is the optimal way to detect an embedded pattern in noise (for example, see the discussion in <ref> [ Rosenfeld and Kak, 1982 ] </ref> ). The problems with template matching approaches are profound as well: any change in object pose (rotation or translation in depth) requires a new template, and any amount of occlusion results in a corresponding drop in match quality.

However, its inability to explain category-level recognition forces us to discount it as a general theory of object recognition. <p> Usually, programs possess a fixed modelbase and a fixed recognition strategy; it is generally simple to add models to this modelbase, but a human operator must do so by hand, usually by supplying either a set of geometric measurements of the object <ref> [ Thompson and Mundy, 1987 ] </ref> , or a set of stylized images of the object [ Forsyth et al., 1991 ] .

Statistical learning theory <ref> [ Vapnik, 1996; Devroye et al., 1996 ] </ref> , whose goal is to determine which measurements in a mass of detail are cogent and distinctive, provides a rigorous and principled mechanism for these processes. The statistical view of learning is well developed, powerful and relatively complete, but abstract. <p> One approach to building a program that learns to recognize objects would be to use images of these objects as data points, object names as associated values, and take, say, a support-vector classifier <ref> [ Vapnik, 1996 ] </ref> to build a function that associates the two. This approach does not work, mainly because the amount of data required is enormous; for each object, the data set would need to show the object in typical poses, in typical background contexts and occluded in typical fashion.

Reference-contexts: been used to merge local superquadric fits into a global object description [ Pentland, 1986 ] , and objects can be segmented at concavities [ Hoffman and Richards, 1984 ] , or at the singularities of some image or object description process such as the Blum transform in two dimensions <ref> [ Blum, 1967; Zhu and Yuille, 1995 ] </ref> or generalized cylinders in three dimensions [ Binford, 1995 ] . * Finally, some (many?) objects lack an obvious volumetric part decomposition: consider for example a shoe, a car, a face, my sun glasses, or a chicken.
