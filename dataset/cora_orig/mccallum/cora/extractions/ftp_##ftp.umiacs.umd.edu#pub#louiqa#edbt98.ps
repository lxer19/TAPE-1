Title: Equal Time for Data on the Internet with WebSemantics  
Author: George A. Mihaila Louiqa Raschid Anthony Tomasic 
Abstract: Many collections of scientific data in particular disciplines, e.g., the environmental sciences, are available today around the world. Much of this data conforms to some agreed upon standard for data exchange, i.e., a standard schema and its semantics. However, sharing this data among a global community of users is still difficult because of a lack of standards for the following necessary functions: (i) data providers need a standard for describing or publishing available sources of data; data administrators need a standard for (ii) discovering the published data and (iii) users need a standard for accessing this discovered data. This paper describes a prototype implementation of a system, WebSemantics, that accomplishes the above tasks. We describe an architecture and protocols for the publication, discovery and access to scientific data, that are an extension of the World Wide Web architecture and protocols. We describe a standard format for the exchange of metadata. We define a language for discovering sources and querying the data in these sources, and we provide a formal semantics for this language.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we review this research. We consider industry-wide open database standards and wrapper mediator architectures; both are critical for WebSemantics. We also review some alternate technology such as Harvest/Essence [BDH + 95]; InfoSleuth [B + 97]; SIMS <ref> [AKS96] </ref>; DIOM [DIO] and WWW query languages [KS95, MMM96]. We now consider wrapper mediator architectures, as proposed in [ACPS96, B + 97, C + 95, G + 96, KLSS95, R + 89, P + 96, TRV96, Wie92].

There are several other projects that deal with scaling to large numbers of resources. InfoSleuth <ref> [B + 97] </ref> proposes information brokering and domain ontologies as two ways to handle data sources. We believe that domain ontologies are a promising extension to the catalog server, since they provide a way to structure domain information (types).

Reference-contexts: However, WebSemantics is not a stand-alone technology, and it depends on the existence of other technologies. In this section, we review this research. We consider industry-wide open database standards and wrapper mediator architectures; both are critical for WebSemantics. We also review some alternate technology such as Harvest/Essence <ref> [BDH + 95] </ref>; InfoSleuth [B + 97]; SIMS [AKS96]; DIOM [DIO] and WWW query languages [KS95, MMM96].

Distributed information retrieval systems, for example the Harvest/Essence information retrieval based system <ref> [BDH + 95] </ref> are indirectly related to our work. Essence is a customizable information extraction system that is used to extract and structure mostly textual information from documents in Harvest. It exploits the formats of common file types and extracts contents of files.

Reference-contexts: Wrappers are software components that provide a common interface for various storage systems, ranging from passive file systems 6 to data base management systems. A variety of wrapper implementations are currently available, ranging from the powerful and widely accepted JDBC [SM] to wrappers for DISCO [TRV96], IM [KLSS95], Garlic <ref> [C + 95] </ref> etc. Since WebSemantics is a system for publishing and sharing data across multiple (wrapped) data sources, we expect that a variety of WebSemantics wrapper implementations will be developed as needed. <p> These systems differ widely in the capabilities of mediators and in the capabilities of wrappers. However, we believe that interoperation between WebSe-mantics and these systems is possible. WebSemantics differs in two distinct ways from these systems. Wrappers developed for Garlic <ref> [C + 95] </ref> and the Information Manifold [KLSS95] assume the location of the data sources, types, and wrapper capability, are embedded within the wrappers. Wrappers for DISCO [TRV96] and TSIMMIS [GMHI + 95, VP97] use declarative languages to export types and query capabilities.

Reference-contexts: WebSQL [MMM96] integrates textual retrieval with structure and topology-based queries. Instead of trying to model document structure with some kind of object-oriented schema, as in <ref> [CACS94, QRS + 95] </ref>, a minimalist relational approach is taken: each Web document is associated with a tuple in a virtual Document relation and each hypertext link with a tuple in a virtual Anchor relation.

Reference-contexts: For example, governments have recognized that information about the environment has important consequences in the management of sustainable economic growth. As a result, many collections of environmental data, located around the world, are now available to scientists <ref> [Fra97] </ref>. Much of this data conforms to existing standards for the definition of data. These standards help scientists share information since each item of data is precisely defined. However, the sharing of information between scientists is still a very difficult process.

Reference-contexts: WebSemantics differs in two distinct ways from these systems. Wrappers developed for Garlic [C + 95] and the Information Manifold [KLSS95] assume the location of the data sources, types, and wrapper capability, are embedded within the wrappers. Wrappers for DISCO [TRV96] and TSIMMIS <ref> [GMHI + 95, VP97] </ref> use declarative languages to export types and query capabilities. The location of components is embedded within the mediators.

Reference-contexts: The last step is combining the results obtained from all the sources. The run-time system uses the Graefe iterator model (presented in <ref> [Gra93] </ref>). In order to evaluate a query, an algebraic tree is generated. Besides the standard relational algebra operators, we defined several additional operators that model the domain predicates introduced in Section 4.6.

The Information Manifold <ref> [KLSS95] </ref> is a system for browsing and querying multiple networked information sources. The system uses knowledge representation technology to organize disparate, heterogeneous data sources.

Reference-contexts: The information stored in SOIF records is similar to the metadata about sources maintained by WebSemantics catalogs. However, these systems focus passive documents 17 and information retrieval search, whereas we focus on querying strictly typed data in both active and passive data repositories. Another system <ref> [WID97] </ref> focuses on CORBA IDL access via WWW protocols instead of query based access. There are several other projects that deal with scaling to large numbers of resources. InfoSleuth [B + 97] proposes information brokering and domain ontologies as two ways to handle data sources.
