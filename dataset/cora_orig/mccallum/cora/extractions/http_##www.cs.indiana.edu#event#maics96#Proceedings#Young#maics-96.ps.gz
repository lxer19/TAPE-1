Abstract: A Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph in which nodes are random variables and the edges indicate that the source exerts direct causal influence on the destination. A problem with the Bayesian network is that there is no natural mechanism for representing temporal relations between and within the random variables. This paper introduces a new technique for representing when a random variable holds a particular state, e.g. when an event happens, as well as techniques for applying temporal constraints (precedes, during, etc.) to the edges. Allen's interval structure is used to provide the formal basis. A restricted model is presented along with a corresponding inferencing algorithm based on a linear constraint formulation.

Reference-contexts: The technique allows representation of time constrained causality, of when and if events occur, and of the periodic and recurrent nature of processes. Bayesian networks lie at the foundation of the system and provide the probabilistic basis. Allen's interval system <ref> [1] </ref> and his 13 relations provide the temporal basis. 2 Theoretical Structures In probabilistic reasoning, random variables (RVs) are used to represent events and objects. By making various assignments to these RVs, we can model the current state of the world and weight the states according to the joint probabilities. <p> Uncertainty in the exact relationship between intervals is expressed as disjunctions. For example, "interval A precedes or meets interval B" is written as Af&lt;; mgB. Some commonly used disjunctions are disjoint, written f&lt;; &gt;; m; mig, and contains, written fdi; si; f ig <ref> [1] </ref>. A temporal random variable is a set of states, e.g. ftrue; falseg, f1; 2; 3g, or ffalseg [ fRed; Blueg, and a set of temporal intervals each having an associated random variable (RV). Each RV has defined a density function giving the probability for each state.

Reference-contexts: [4] uses a cost based approach to model the uncertainty in an events occurrence, however the costs are adhoc and TAP does not model the uncertainty as to when the event happened or for how long. y This research was supported in part by AFOSR Project #940006. 1 Bayesian networks <ref> [2] </ref> provide a robust, probabilistic method of reasoning with uncer-tainty which has become popular with artificial intelligence researchers. Bayesian networks, however, do not provide a direct mechanism for representing temporal dependencies. <p> In a Bayesian network, the joint conditional probability of a complete assignment is found using the chain rule <ref> [2, pg. 227] </ref>. In the FMTBN, the chain rule is also used. We perform a topological ordering on the nodes of the TBN to find the order of computation. As the TRVs are not dependent on anything, they are placed at the end of the order. <p> Thus since E v A, we derive P (AjE) = P (A) Following the above method, the FMTBN can be transformed into an equivalent Bayesian network that can than be used for belief revision and updating <ref> [2] </ref>. Details of the transform are available in [5]. The transform generates many conditional probabilities, requiring 2 i conditional probabilities for the ith interval. As the TRV requires only one conditional probability per interval, the large number of probabilities introduced by the transform are wasteful.

Reference-contexts: The conciseness, in terms of probabilities needed, of the TRV notation, suggests that using Bayesian networks for computation may not be the best approach. An alternate approach, using a linear constraint system, was developed. This extends an approach developed in <ref> [3] </ref> for coding Bayesian Networks as a system of linear constraints. The following steps produce the constraints, variables, and costs. 1. <p> Note that the construction of the linear constraint system can be done linear to the size of T. Contrast this with the conversion to Bayesian network which was exponential to the size of T. After the linear constraint system has been fleshed out for the TRVs, the method from <ref> [3] </ref> is used to provide the rules for the rest of the random variables. An algorithm from same, using mixed Boolean linear programming, allows determination of the most probable explanation. 4 Conclusion We have presented a new technique for representing probabilistic knowledge in the temporal domain.

Reference-contexts: Prior temporal modeling techniques have often had difficulty modeling uncertainty as to when and if an event occurs. Techniques able to model uncertainty often do not have strong semantics. One such method, the Temporal Abduction Problem (TAP) of <ref> [4] </ref> uses a cost based approach to model the uncertainty in an events occurrence, however the costs are adhoc and TAP does not model the uncertainty as to when the event happened or for how long. y This research was supported in part by AFOSR Project #940006. 1 Bayesian networks [2]
