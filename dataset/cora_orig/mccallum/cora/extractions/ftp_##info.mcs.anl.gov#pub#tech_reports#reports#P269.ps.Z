Abstract: Two independent approaches to the theory of the lattice rule have been exploited at length in the literature. One is based on the generator matrix A of the lattice fl whose elements provide the abscissas of Q. The other, based on the t-cycle form Q(fl)f of Sloan and Lyness, leads to a canonical form for Q. In this paper, a close connection between these approaches is demonstrated. This connection stems from the close relation between the Kronecker decomposition theorem for Abelian groups and the Smith normal form of an integer matrix. It is shown that the invariants of the canonical form of Q(fl)f coincide with the elements of the Smith normal form of B = A T1 , the reciprocal lattice generator matrix. This fact may be used to provide a straightforward solution to the previously intransigent problem of identifying and removing a repetition in the general t-cycle form.

Reference-contexts: This is essentially the Hermite normal form. It has been exploited in previous papers to count the number of lattice rules, to obtain information about sublattices and superlattices, and to form the basis of a search program for good lattice rules <ref> (see, e.g., Lyness, Sorevik, and Keast 1991) </ref>. 7 As mentioned earlier, integer column operations applied to B (or postmultiplication by unimodular matrices) result in a matrix that represents a different lattice. Nevertheless, if one allows column operations as well as row operations, one may put B into diagonal form.

Reference-contexts: This has led to results about the number of distinct lattice rules and the structure of embedded lattice rules, and has provided much of the underlying theory needed for a complete search for good (cost-effective) lattice rules. However, the original approach to this theory <ref> (see e.g. Sloan 1985 and Sloan and Lyness 1989) </ref> is quite different, and uses a notation which appears to be entirely independent.
