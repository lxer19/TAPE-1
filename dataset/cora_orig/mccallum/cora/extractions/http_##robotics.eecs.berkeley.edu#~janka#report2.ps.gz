Title: Vision-Based Lateral Control of Vehicles: Look-ahead and Delay Issues  
Author: Jana Kosecka 
Date: December 18, 1996  
Abstract: Recent interest in highway automation and current advances in real-time image processing provide a suitable testbed for employing the visual information extracted from image sequences in the feedback loop of the control system. The main advantage of vision-based control for steering is that of the availability of information about the road ahead of the vehicle, which is essential for a human driver. This information is extracted from the road imagery using an algorithm for robust detection of lane markers followed by a linear fit at various look-ahead ranges, with known camera geometry [TMW96]. The main objective of the controller is to keep the vehicle in the center of the road while maintaining its orientation parallel to the road tangent. The relative position of the vehicle with respect to the road is captured by the offset y L from the centerline and the yaw angle " L of the vehicle with respect to the road at some look-ahead distance L. Considering the full dynamical model of the vehicle, various strategies for controller design are presented. We investigate the choice of the look-ahead distance L, which varies with the longitudinal velocity and is affected by the quality of the offset estimates. Further we characterize the effect of the delay caused by vision processing and the use of curvature information in the controller design. Several controller design techniques and closed loop simulations are presented.

Reference-contexts: by adding an extra derivative action; however the feasibility of this approach can be quite susceptible to the noise in the vision estimates in realistic conditions. 3.4 (Optimal) Output Feedback Pole Placement We also investigated the use of another output " L , in the output feedback pole placement method <ref> [Dav70] </ref>. Since two outputs are directly measurable by vision system and the conditions for output feedback pole placement are satisfied, we can place arbitrarily two poles of the system. However this strategy cannot guarantee the location of the other two poles.

Reference-contexts: This information is difficult to estimate directly by the vision system without the information about the curvature of the reference path. An approach which leaned away from the appeal of using the information ahead of the vehicle directly for control purposes, has been pursued by <ref> [DM92] </ref>. Dickmans formulated the problem of the estimation of the state of the vehicle and the estimation of the road geometry from the vision measurements ahead of the vehicle. The obtained state estimates were then used for state feedback control design, using a pole-placement method.

Reference-contexts: The stability and sensitivity issues have not been addressed. While the approach worked for many road situations it is not clear whether this cue is sufficient for general road scenarios. The automated steering tasks using vision has been also formulated within the visual servoing paradigm <ref> [ECR92] </ref>. The stability analysis was provided, for an ominidirectional mobile base trying to align with a straight road. We are currently investigating formulation of the control problem in the image plane using more general parameterized primitives and car-like kinematic models with nonholonomic constraints.

Reference-contexts: The second component is a pure time delay element e T d s representing the latency T d of the vision subsystem. The exponential function is approximated by a rational function using the Pade approximation <ref> [FPEN94] </ref> and becomes: D (s) = e T d s 2 + T d s The transfer function C (s) corresponds to the controller. 2.5 Control objective The vehicle control objective is to follow the reference path specified by radius R ref (curvature K ref = 1 ). <p> We can conclude that the delay in our system can be compensated by additional phase lead provided by increased look-ahead distance. Another possible delay compensation typically used is the Smith predictor <ref> [FPEN94] </ref>. Smith proposed an approach that allows to design a compensator as for delay-free system, by feedback cancellation of the actual plant output and adding the plant output of the delay free system.

Reference-contexts: Part of the delay was attributed to time it takes to process visual information [Lan96]. In addition to studying sensing aspects of human drivers, several models of driver steering have been developed <ref> [Hes90] </ref>. Understanding of human steering performance became highly inspirational, in the design of automated steering controllers. The control theoretic approaches deal both with kinematic and dynamic models. In the kinematic setting there have been several attempts to formulate the vision based steering task in the image plane.

Reference-contexts: At higher speeds the preview information becomes more important. The preview information has been shown sufficient for satisfactory road following in spite of the presence of delay 0.73 s between gaze-shifts and steering movements.

Reference-contexts: They asserted that while driving on a curved road the gaze shifts from tangent points on the inside of each curve. The new tangent point is sought for about 1-2s before entering the curve. In addition to previewing the road ahead of the car, authors in <ref> [LH95] </ref> had shown that drivers also use the information from the near 1 range in front of the car. The information from the near range improves the position of the car in the lane. At higher speeds the preview information becomes more important.

Reference-contexts: Different aspects of steering problem has been examined extensively in the past, both in the psychophysics literature as well as in the control theoretic studies. Land and his colleagues <ref> [LL94] </ref> studied the correlation between the direction of gaze and the steering performance of human drivers. They asserted that while driving on a curved road the gaze shifts from tangent points on the inside of each curve. The new tangent point is sought for about 1-2s before entering the curve. <p> A solution to this problem can be inspired by human driver behavior, where the gaze is shifted to the next inner arc of the curve <ref> [LL94] </ref>, so instead of generating a large offset at look-ahead, the gaze shifts and so generates a small offset (see Figure 11b). 3.3 Lead Controller In order to accommodate smaller look-aheads at higher velocities we need to provide some additional means of improving the stability and providing sufficient phase lead in

This statement asserts the stability of the internal dynamics of the vehicle subsystem only.
