Abstract: The set of operations S 1 = f+; ; fl; =; &gt;g is used in algebraic computations to avoid degeneracies (e.g., division by zero), but is also used in numerical computations to avoid huge roundoff errors (e.g., division by a small quantity). On the other hand, the classes of algorithms using operations from the set S 2 = f+; ; fl; =g or from the set S 3 = f+; ; flg are the most studied in complexity theory, and are used, e.g., to obtain fast parallel algorithms for numerical problems. In this paper, we study, by using a simulation argument, the relative power of the sets S 1 , S 2 , and S 3 for computing with approximations. We prove that S 2 does very efficiently simulate S 1 , while S 3 does not;

Reference-contexts: More precisely, we adopt models which are a structured version of the above models, which turn out to be particularly useful for a detailed analysis (see <ref> [Aberer & Codenotti, 1992] </ref>). Before describing the models of computation, it is convenient to define which kind of algorithms we consider. An algorithm using operations f+; ; fl; =g is called oblivious rational. An algorithm using operations f+; ; flg is called oblivious polynomial.

Reference-contexts: Typically, a lower bound which has to hold for all instances should be zero. Therefore we adopt the following strategy, which is based on an adversary argument (a similar approach can be found in <ref> [Codenotti et al., 1991] </ref>, or [Traub et al., 1988]). In other words we assume an adversary can decide about the input distribution. This leads to the following definition of unavoidable roundoff error.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the results obtained were similar to those presented for computations over the reals, with some additional features related to the fact that the non negligible volumes of tubes over complex varieties lead to non trivial lower bounds <ref> [Demmel, 1988, Weyl, 1939] </ref>. We will report these results in the full paper. 4 Conclusions and Further Work In this paper we have shown that approximate computations over the reals do not suffer very much from the lack of conditionals, provided that division is allowed. <p> Is its oblivious counterpart, obtained by approximate simulation, also P-complete?

Arithmetic network and branching programs are generally analyzed (see, e.g., <ref> [Strassen, 1990] </ref>) to measure the extra cost necessary to avoid degeneracies, e.g., divisions by zero.
