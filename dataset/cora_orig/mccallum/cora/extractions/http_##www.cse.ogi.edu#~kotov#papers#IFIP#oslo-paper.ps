Abstract: In the Software Design for Reliability and Reuse (SDRR) project the Pacific Software Research Center (PacSoft) at the Oregon Graduate Institute of Science & Technology (OGI) explored a new approach to research in an academic environment. The goal of the project was to develop a new technology for efficiently building application generators; implement this technology in a real Air Force domain; and experimentally validate this technology by comparing it against other candidate technologies for improving productivity. The PacSoft team successfully adapted military and industrial standard project management techniques not usually used in academia including detailed project planning, measurements, and quarterly customer program management reviews. The use of these techniques was a significant contribution towards the successful completion of the project and the product delivery on schedule and within budget. Pac-Soft used the recommended DoD core set of measurements (size, effort,

Reference-contexts: A list of capabilities might be an answer to the question "What can this program do?" The Capabilities metric is a functional metric that is slightly different from well-known function points and feature points metrics in a sense that it is more a characteristic of functionality than complexity ([4], <ref> [5] </ref>, and [6]). This metric is very user-oriented because it deals with external features of the software product. Two characteristics of the Capabilities metric made it very well suited for this project. * Capabilities are available early in the project.

Reference-contexts: Use of non-traditional programming language (Standard ML) prevented us from using other projects' data. This put additional requirement to the measurement program to predict schedule based on data collected in the early stages of the project. To make schedule predictions, a functional metrics the Capabilities metric was proposed <ref> [9] </ref>. Basically, a capability is a unit of functionality 4 of software.
