Title: The Quantitative Structure of Exponential Time  
Author: Jack H. Lutz 
Note: This is page 1 Printer: Opaque this  
Abstract: Recent results on the internal, measure-theoretic structure of the exponential time complexity classes E and EXP are surveyed. The measure structure of these classes is seen to interact in informative ways with bi-immunity, complexity cores, polynomial-time reductions, completeness, circuit-size complexity, Kolmogorov complexity, natural proofs, pseudorandom generators, the density of hard languages, randomized complexity, and lowness. Possible implications for the structure of NP are also discussed.

Reference-contexts: Then p (H m (E)) = 0. Proof. Let A be as in Corollary 4.3. Then H m (E) P 1 m (A), so Lemma 6.2 tells us that p (H m (E)) = p (P 1 2 Recently, Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn <ref> [ANT] </ref> have used resource-bounded genericity to prove the extension of Lemma 6.2 obtained by sub stituting P ktt -reductions and P 1 ktt (A) for P m -reductions and P 1 m (A), respectively, where k is a fixed positive integer. <p> From this they have obtained the following extension of Theorem 6.1. Theorem 6.4 (Small P ktt -Span Theorem Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Ter-wijn <ref> [ANT] </ref>). Let k be a positive integer. 1. The Quantitative Structure of Exponential Time 14 FIGURE 2.

Theorem 6.5 (Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn <ref> [ANT] </ref>). Let k be a posi tive integer. If H ktt (E) is the set of all languages that are P ktt -hard for E, then p (H ktt (E)) = 0. 1. <p> Buhrman and Mayordomo [BM95b] and, independently, Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn <ref> [ANT] </ref>, have shown that the class H btt (E) has p 2 -measure 0. The Small P m -Span Theorem has immediate consequences for the P m - degree structure of E and EXP. <p> We now see that Mayordomo's result also follows from Theorem 6.3 and from Theorem 6.6. Using Theorem 6.4 in place of Theorem 6.1 gives the following extension of Theorem 6.6. Theorem 6.8 (Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn <ref> [ANT] </ref>). For all A f0; 1g fl and all positive integers k, (deg P ktt (A)jEXP) = 0 It is not currently known whether all P btt -degrees have measure 0 in E or EXP, but this at least holds for the complete P btt -degree. <p> Theorem 6.9 (Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn <ref> [ANT] </ref>). Let C btt (E); C btt (EXP) be the sets of languages that are P btt -complete for E, EXP, respectively. <p> It will be worthwhile to inves tigate how far in the direction of P T -reducibility these results can be extended. For example, a Small Span Theorem for P T -reductions (or even for P tt -reductions) in EXP would imply that EXP 6 BPP <ref> [JL95a, ANT] </ref>. 3. In light of Theorem 11.4 and Corollary 11.6, it may well be that measure arguments can be used to simplify or replace other known stage constructions.

Reference-contexts: The interested reader is referred to <ref> [Lut92, Lutb, May94b, Jue94, JL95b, ATZ] </ref> for more discussion, examples, and technical machinery. Definition. A martingale is a function d : f0; 1g fl ! [0; 1) with the property that, for all w 2 f0; 1g fl , d (w) = 2 1. <p> Using the martingale dilation technique developed by Ambos-Spies, Ter-wijn, and Zheng <ref> [ATZ] </ref>, Juedes and Lutz proved the following. Lemma 7.4 (Juedes and Lutz [JL95b]). Let X be a set of languages. 1. If p 2 (P m (X)) = 0, then p (X) = 0. 2. If (P m (X)jEXP) = 0, then (XjE) = 0. This yields the following. <p> Theorem 7.8 (Ambos-Spies, Terwijn, and Zheng <ref> [ATZ] </ref>). p (WH m (E)) = 1: Corollary 7.9 (Ambos-Spies, Terwijn, and Zheng [ATZ]). p 2 (WH m (EXP)) = 1: Proof. <p> Theorem 7.8 (Ambos-Spies, Terwijn, and Zheng <ref> [ATZ] </ref>). p (WH m (E)) = 1: Corollary 7.9 (Ambos-Spies, Terwijn, and Zheng [ATZ]). p 2 (WH m (EXP)) = 1: Proof. This follows immediately from Theorems 7.8 and 7.5. 2 By Theorems 7.8 and 6.7, then, almost every language in E is weakly P m -complete, but not P m -complete, for E.

The Quantitative Structure of Exponential Time 10 In light of this proposition, languages that are incompressible by P m - reductions are sometimes called "strongly P-bi-immune" <ref> [BS85, BDG90] </ref>. The following result shows that almost every language in E is P-bi immune. Theorem 4.5 (Mayordomo [May94a]). Almost every language in E, and almost every language in EXP, is P-bi-immune. <p> Although Theorem 4.5 follows immediately from Corollary 4.2 and Proposition 4.4, it should be noted that Mayordomo's proof of this result preceded, and was independent of, the proofs of Theorem 4.1 and Corollary 4.2. 5 Complexity cores Complexity cores, first introduced by Lynch [Lyn75], have been studied extensively. (See <ref> [BDG90] </ref> for an overview of such work.) Intuitively, a complexity core of a language A is a fixed set K of inputs such that every machine whose decisions are consistent with A fails to decide efficiently on all but finitely many elements of K.

Reference-contexts: Let C m (E), C m (EXP) be the sets of languages that are P m -complete for E, EXP, respectively. Then (C m (E) j E) = (C m (EXP) j EXP) = 0. Mayordomo's original proof of this result used Theorem 4.5 and Berman's result <ref> [Ber76] </ref> that no P m -complete language for E or EXP is P-immune. We now see that Mayordomo's result also follows from Theorem 6.3 and from Theorem 6.6. Using Theorem 6.4 in place of Theorem 6.1 gives the following extension of Theorem 6.6.

Reference-contexts: If NP does not have p-measure 0, then E 6= NE and EE 6= NEE. Corollary 12.6 (Lutz and Mayordomo [LM]). If NP does not have p measure 0, then there is an NP search problem that does not reduce to the corresponding decision problem. Proof. Bellare and Goldwasser <ref> [BG94] </ref> have shown that, if EE 6= NEE, then there is an NP search problem that does not reduce to the correspond ing decision problem. The present corollary follows immediately from this and Theorem 12.5. 2 We now consider complexity cores of languages that are P m -hard for NP.

Reference-contexts: There exists a language that is P T -complete, but not P m -complete, for NP. The CvKL Conjecture is very ambitious, since it implies that P 6= NP. The question has thus been raised <ref> [LLS75, Sel79, Hom90, BHT91] </ref> whether the CvKL Conjecture can be derived from some reasonable complexity-theoretic hypothesis, such as P 6= NP or the separation of the polynomial-time hierarchy into infinitely many levels.

Reference-contexts: Proposition 4.4 (Ko and Moore [KM75]). Every language that is incompressible by P m -reductions is P-bi-immune. 1. The Quantitative Structure of Exponential Time 10 In light of this proposition, languages that are incompressible by P m - reductions are sometimes called "strongly P-bi-immune" <ref> [BS85, BDG90] </ref>. The following result shows that almost every language in E is P-bi immune. Theorem 4.5 (Mayordomo [May94a]). Almost every language in E, and almost every language in EXP, is P-bi-immune. <p> Intuitively, a P-complexity core of A is a set of infeasible instances of A, while an exponential complexity core of A is a set of extremely hard instances of A. The following observation, an obvious generalization of a result of Balcazar and Schoning <ref> [BS85] </ref> (see Corollary 5.2 below), relates incompressibility to complexity cores. Lemma 5.1 (Juedes and Lutz [JL95a]). If t : N ! N is time constructible then every language that is incompressible by DTIME (t) m -reductions has f0; 1g fl as a DTIME (t)-complexity core. Corollary 5.2. <p> Lemma 5.1 (Juedes and Lutz [JL95a]). If t : N !

Reference-contexts: This result, which appears to be very useful, is explained in this section. Properties defined in terms of limiting frequencies of failure of prediction schemes are called stochasticity properties in the terminology of Kol-mogorov [KU87, USS90]. (Such properties were originally proposed by von Mises [vM39] and Church <ref> [Chu40] </ref> in their efforts to define randomness.) Because the prediction schemes allowed in this section are of a restricted sort, the property discussed here is a weak stochasticity property. We now make our terminology precise. Our notion of advice classes is standard [KL80].

Reference-contexts: The next result concerns NP-completeness. The NP-completeness of decision problems has two principal, well-known formulations. These are the P T -completeness introduced by Cook <ref> [Coo71] </ref> and the P m -completeness introduced by Karp [Kar72] and Levin [Lev73]. It is widely conjectured ([LLS75, You83, LY90, Hom90]) that these two notions are distinct: CvKL Conjecture. ("Cook versus Karp-Levin"). There exists a language that is P T -complete, but not P m -complete, for NP.

Reference-contexts: Such simplification might clarify issues, leading to further progress. 4. Many other structural aspects of E and EXP remain to be investigated from the standpoint of resource-bounded measure. For example, it seems likely that resource-bounded measure will shed light on the theory of average-case complexity. Cai and Selman <ref> [CS96] </ref> have made one observation in this regard, but we hope that this is only a beginning. 5.

Reference-contexts: E is a proper subset of EXP, but it contains P and "the essential part of NP" [Wat87b], i.e., many NP-complete problems. (iii) E and EXP have been proven to contain intractable problems <ref> [HS65] </ref>. From the standpoint of complexity theory, this existence of intractabil ity is a valuable resource. This is because, in practice, a proof that a specific language A is intractable proceeds by inferring the intractability of A from the intractability of some language B chosen or constructed for this purpose. <p> A problem that is P m -hard for E is provably intractable by the time hierarchy theorem of Hartmanis and Stearns <ref> [HS65] </ref>. In fact, problems that are P m -hard for E are now known to have very strong intractability properties [BS85, Huy86, KOSW94, OS86, Sch86a].

Reference-contexts: Meyer [Mey77] proved that E contains languages that are incompressible by P m -reductions. The following result shows that almost every language in E has this property. Theorem 4.1 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [JL95a] </ref>). Let c 2 Z + and define the sets X = fA f0; 1g fl jA is incompressible by DTIME (2 cn ) m reductionsg, Y = fA f0; 1g fl jA is incompressible by DTIME (2 n c ) m reductionsg. <p> Since fi fi b d r (w) d (w) fi fi = i=r+jwj+1 1 X 2 jwji = 2 r for all r 2 N and w 2 f0; 1g fl , it follows that d is p-computable. 2 Corollary 4.2 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [JL95a] </ref>). Almost every language in E and almost every language in EXP is incompressible by P m -reductions. Corollary 4.3 (Meyer [Mey77]). There is a language A 2 E that is incom pressible by P m -reductions. We conclude this section with a brief discussion of P-bi-immunity. Definition. <p> The following observation, an obvious generalization of a result of Balcazar and Schoning [BS85] (see Corollary 5.2 below), relates incompressibility to complexity cores. Lemma 5.1 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [JL95a] </ref>). If t : N ! N is time constructible then every language that is incompressible by DTIME (t) m -reductions has f0; 1g fl as a DTIME (t)-complexity core. Corollary 5.2. <p> Theorem 4.1 and Corollary 5.2 now tell us that almost every language decidable in exponential time has complexity cores of the largest possible size. Corollary 5.3 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [JL95a] </ref>). Let c 2 Z + . 1. Almost every language in E has f0; 1g fl as a DTIME (2 cn )-complexity core. 2. <p> That is, only small-span configurations can occur in E or EXP. FIGURE 1. The upper span, lower span (shaded), and degree of A. Theorem 6.1 (Small P m -Span Theorem|Juedes and Lutz <ref> [JL95a] </ref>). 1. For every A 2 E, (P m (A) j E) = 0 p (P 1 m (A) j E) = 0: 2. For every A 2 EXP, (P m (A) j EXP) = 0 p 2 (P 1 m (A) j EXP) = 0: 1. <p> The Quantitative Structure of Exponential Time 13 Ambos-Spies [Amb86] has shown that P m 1 (A) has Lebesgue measure 0 whenever A 62 P. The following lemma obtains a stronger conclusion (resource-bounded measure 0) from a stronger hypothesis on A. Lemma 6.2 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [JL95a] </ref>). Let A be a language that is incompressible by P m -reductions. 1. If A 2 E, then p (P 1 m (A)) = 0; and hence (P 1 m (A) j E) = 0. 2. <p> The proof of 2 is identical. 2 Using the Small Span Theorem, we note that P m -hard languages for E are extremely rare. Theorem 6.3 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [JL95a] </ref>). Let H m (E) be the set of all languages that are P m -hard for E. Then p (H m (E)) = 0. Proof. Let A be as in Corollary 4.3. <p> The Small P m -Span Theorem has immediate consequences for the P m - degree structure of E and EXP. The P m degree of a language A f0; 1g fl is the set deg P 1 (A): Theorem 6.6 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [JL95a] </ref>). For all A f0; 1g fl , (deg P m (A) j EXP) = 0: Proof. This follows immediately from Theorem 6.1. 2 Theorem 6.7 (Mayordomo [May94a]). Let C m (E), C m (EXP) be the sets of languages that are P m -complete for E, EXP, respectively. <p> Theorem 7.2 (Orponen and Schoning [OS86]). Every language that is P m -hard for E has a dense P-complexity core. The following theorem extends Theorem 7.2 (in somewhat stronger form) to all weakly P m -hard languages for E. Theorem 7.3 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [JL95a] </ref>). Every language that is weakly P m -hard for E or EXP has a dense exponential complexity core. Thus the weakly P m -hard problems for E and EXP are, like the P m -hard problems, provably strongly intractable. <p> The following result states that every P m -hard language for E can be decided in time 2 4n on a dense set of instances that can itself be decided in time 2 4n . Theorem 8.1 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [JL95a] </ref>). For every P m -hard language H for E, there exist B; D 2 DTIME (2 4n ) such that D is dense and B = H "D. <p> It is straightforward to use Theorem 8.1 to prove that P m -hard languages for E obey the following upper bound on the sizes of complexity cores. Theorem 8.2 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [JL95a] </ref>). Every DTIME (2 4n )-complexity core of every P m -hard language for E has a dense complement. By Corollary 5.3, almost every language in E has f0; 1g fl as a DTIME (2 4n )- complexity core. <p> If P 6= NP, then every language that is P m -hard for NP has a nonsparse P-complexity core. 1. The Quantitative Structure of Exponential Time 30 Strengthening the hypothesis of Theorem 12.7 gives a stronger conclusion. (This essentially follows from Theorem 7.3.) Theorem 12.8 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [JL95a] </ref>). If NP does not have p-measure 0, then every language that is P m -hard for NP has a dense exponential complexity core. Concerning the density of hard languages for NP, Theorem 11.5 gives us the following result. <p> It will be worthwhile to inves tigate how far in the direction of P T -reducibility these results can be extended. For example, a Small Span Theorem for P T -reductions (or even for P tt -reductions) in EXP would imply that EXP 6 BPP <ref> [JL95a, ANT] </ref>. 3. In light of Theorem 11.4 and Corollary 11.6, it may well be that measure arguments can be used to simplify or replace other known stage constructions. Such simplification might clarify issues, leading to further progress. 4.

Every language that is incompressible by P m -reductions is P-bi-immune. 1.

Using standard techniques, the following result has been derived from Theorem 12.4. Theorem 12.5 (Lutz and Mayordomo <ref> [LM] </ref>). If NP does not have p-measure 0, then E 6= NE and EE 6= NEE. Corollary 12.6 (Lutz and Mayordomo [LM]). If NP does not have p measure 0, then there is an NP search problem that does not reduce to the corresponding decision problem. Proof. <p> Using standard techniques, the following result has been derived from Theorem 12.4. Theorem 12.5 (Lutz and Mayordomo <ref> [LM] </ref>). If NP does not have p-measure 0, then E 6= NE and EE 6= NEE. Corollary 12.6 (Lutz and Mayordomo [LM]). If NP does not have p measure 0, then there is an NP search problem that does not reduce to the corresponding decision problem. Proof. <p> To date, despite extensive work [Sel79, KM75, Wat87a, Wat87b, WT92, Wat87b, BHT91, LY90, LLS75, Sel79, Hom90, BHT91] , even this more modest objective has not been achieved. The following result shows that the CvKL Conjecture holds under our strong measure-theoretic hypothesis. Theorem 12.10 (Lutz and Mayordomo <ref> [LM] </ref>). If NP does not have p-measure 0, then there is a language C that is P T -complete, but not P m - complete for NP. Of the measure-theoretic results mentioned thus far in this section, Theorems 12.4, 12.8, and 12.9 hold with NP replaced by any class whatsoever.

Reference-contexts: [BL96] have shown that resource-bounded measure can also be characterized in terms of the compressibility (and decompressibility) of languages. 4 Incompressibility and bi-immunity Many results on the structure of E and EXP under P m -reducibility use languages that are "incompressible by many-one reductions." This idea, originally exploited by Meyer <ref> [Mey77] </ref>, is developed in the following defini tions. Definition. <p> Intuitively, if f is a DTIME (t) m -reduction of A to B and C f is large, then f compresses many questions "x 2 A?" to fewer questions "f (x) 2 B?" If A is incompressible by P m -reductions, then very little such compression can occur. Meyer <ref> [Mey77] </ref> proved that E contains languages that are incompressible by P m -reductions. The following result shows that almost every language in E has this property. Theorem 4.1 (Juedes and Lutz [JL95a]). <p> Almost every language in E and almost every language in EXP is incompressible by P m -reductions. Corollary 4.3 (Meyer <ref> [Mey77] </ref>). There is a language A 2 E that is incom pressible by P m -reductions. We conclude this section with a brief discussion of P-bi-immunity. Definition. A language A f0; 1g fl is P-immune if, for all languages B A, B 2 P implies that B is finite. <p> Note that SPARSE $ DENSE c , where DENSE c is the complement of DENSE.

Reference-contexts: A problem that is P m -hard for E is provably intractable by the time hierarchy theorem of Hartmanis and Stearns [HS65]. In fact, problems that are P m -hard for E are now known to have very strong intractability properties <ref> [BS85, Huy86, KOSW94, OS86, Sch86a] </ref>. In order to extend the class of provably intractable problems, Lutz [Lut90] proposed investigation of the following measure-theoretic generalization of P m -hardness. Definition. <p> Observation 7.1. If A is weakly P T -hard for E, then A 62 P. In fact, languages that are weakly P m -hard for E are intractable in a much stronger sense. For example, consider the following strong intractability result. Theorem 7.2 (Orponen and Schoning <ref> [OS86] </ref>). Every language that is P m -hard for E has a dense P-complexity core. The following theorem extends Theorem 7.2 (in somewhat stronger form) to all weakly P m -hard languages for E. Theorem 7.3 (Juedes and Lutz [JL95a]). <p> The present corollary follows immediately from this and Theorem 12.5. 2 We now consider complexity cores of languages that are P m -hard for NP. The following result is well-known. Theorem 12.7 (Orponen and Schoning <ref> [OS86] </ref>). If P 6= NP, then every language that is P m -hard for NP has a nonsparse P-complexity core. 1. The Quantitative Structure of Exponential Time 30 Strengthening the hypothesis of Theorem 12.7 gives a stronger conclusion. (This essentially follows from Theorem 7.3.) Theorem 12.8 (Juedes and Lutz [JL95a]).

We now describe these developments more fully. Some terminology and notation will be useful. <p> In fact, such generators are widely conjectured to exist. The existence of p (n)-generators that are nonuniformly exponentially secure is an even stronger conjecture, but not entirely implausible. For example, Regan, Sivakumar, and Cai <ref> [RSC95] </ref> have pointed out that the smallest circuits known to break pseudorandom generators that are based on the discrete logarithm problem have nearly 2 n gates. <p> In any case, the following result shows that the existence of nonuni-formly exponentially secure generators is not consistent with the existence of nonuniformly p 2 -natural properties against P/Poly. Theorem 9.8 (Razborov [Raz]; see also <ref> [RSC95] </ref>).

If (P/PolyjEXP) = 0, then there is a combinatorial property that is nonuniformly p 2 -natural i.o. against P/Poly. By Theorems 9.4 and 9.5, we have the following.
