Abstract: We adapt ideas presented by Auscher to impose boundary conditions on the construction of multiresolution analyses on the interval, as introduced by Cohen, Daubechies and Vial. We construct new orthonormal wavelet bases on the interval satisfying homogeneous boundary conditions. This construction can be extanded to wavelet packets, in the case of one boundary condition at each edge. We present in detail the numerical computation of the filters and of the derivative operators associated to these bases. We derive quadrature formulae in order to study the approximation error at the edge of the interval. Several examples illustrate the present construction.

Reference-contexts: Such embedded spaces V j can be obtained from a MultiResolution Analysis (MRA). Test functions in (3) can be chosen among the scaling functions of the MRA, as in <ref> [BNR 94] </ref>: such a method then has convergence properties similar to those of spectral methods, the precision being limited by the regularity of the MRA.
