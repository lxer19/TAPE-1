Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In their classical paper [ES1], Erd-os and Szekeres proved that any set of more than n2 points in general position in the plane contains n points which are in convex position, i.e., they form the vertex set of a convex n-gon. T. Bisztriczky and G. Fejes Toth <ref> [BF1] </ref>, [F] extended this result to families of convex sets.

Reference-contexts: T. Bisztriczky and G. Fejes Toth proved that there exists a function P 3 (n) such that if jF j &gt; P 3 (n) and any three members of F are in convex position, then F has n members in convex position. Improving their initial result, in <ref> [BF2] </ref> they showed that this statement is true with a function P 3 (n), triply exponential in n. This bound was recently improved to a simply exponential function by Pach and Toth [PT]. <p> Property P n k means that both P k and P n are satisfied. Using these notions, Theorem 1 states that if a family F satisfies property P n 3 , then jF j n2 . T. Bisztriczky and G. Fejes Toth <ref> [BF2] </ref> raised the following more general question. What is the maximum size P k (n) of a family F satisfying property P n k ? Some of their bounds were later improved in [PT].

Reference-contexts: Let A and P be a reference vertex and reference point of F . It is easy to see that there is an internal member B of F so that there is no other internal member above it (see <ref> [FRU] </ref>). By Lemma 1, there are at least k 3 vertices of F , fA 1 ; A 2 ; : : : ; A l g strictly above B. Suppose that one of them, say A 1 , is an irregular vertex.

Reference-contexts: Improving their initial result, in [BF2] they showed that this statement is true with a function P 3 (n), triply exponential in n. This bound was recently improved to a simply exponential function by Pach and Toth <ref> [PT] </ref>. The best known lower bound for P 3 (n) is the classical lower bound for the Erd-os-Szekeres theorem, 2 n2 P 3 (n). If any k members of F are in convex position, then we say that F satisfies property P k . <p> T. Bisztriczky and G. Fejes Toth [BF2] raised the following more general question. What is the maximum size P k (n) of a family F satisfying property P n k ? Some of their bounds were later improved in <ref> [PT] </ref>. The best known bounds are the following: 2 n2 P 3 (n) 2n4 2 2 n+1 k 2 n 1 + n1 k n 1 + n1 k In this note we give a linear upper bound on P k (n) for any k 5.
