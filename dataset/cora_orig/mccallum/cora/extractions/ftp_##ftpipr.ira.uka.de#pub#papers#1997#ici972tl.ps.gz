Abstract: In this paper, the concept of human-robot-team is presented. Because of its high flexibility and adaptability, the human-robot cooperation is expected to have a wide range of applications in uncertain environments, not only in future construction and manufacturing industries but also in service branches. A multi-agent control architecture gives an appropriate frame for the flexibility of the human-robot-team. Robots are considered as intelligent autonomous assistants of humans which can mutually interact on a symbolic level and a physical level. This interaction is achieved through the exchange of information between humans and robots, the interpretation of the transmitted information, the coordination of the activities and the cooperation between independent system components. Equipped with sensing modalities for the perception of the environment, the robot system KAMRO (Karlsruhe Autonomous Mobile Robot) is introduced to demonstrate the principles of the cooperation among humans and robot agents. Finally, emphasis is placed on future studies of human-robot-cooperation.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, it may be impractical to assign permanently all necessary tasks to a single agent, because of historical and physical constraints <ref> [10] </ref>. This explains the necessity of temporary alliances through cooperation where each partner contributes with his specific capabilities to the accomplishment of the final goal. The question of human safety becomes increasingly important as future robots will be required to share their working area with human operator.

Reference-contexts: The operator has just to concentrate on positioning the endeffectors, whereas the robot takes care of the collision avoidance between the two manipulators. Besides, the mobile platform must ensure that the two manipulators are always in a region of optimal configuration <ref> [11] </ref>. The experiments made with KAMARA (Karlsruhe Multi-Agent Robot Architecture) (Fig. 4) demonstrate the validity of the developed multi-agent model and the high flexibility of this architecture, which allows dynamical reconfiguration of the agent-team for cooperation and coordination [12].

Furthermore, the communication protocol on the symbolic level and the negotiation between the autonomous agents are adapted for the human-robot-communication.
