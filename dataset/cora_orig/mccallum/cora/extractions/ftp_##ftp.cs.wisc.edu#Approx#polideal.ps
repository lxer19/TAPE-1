Abstract: The well-established theory of multivariate polynomial ideals (over C) was found in recent years to be important for the investigation of several problems in multivariate approximation. In this note we draw connections between the validity of spectral synthesis in the space of all multivariate sequences and questions in multivariate splines on uniform meshes.

Reference-contexts: We now take an arbitrary exponential g := P 2fi e p in the preimage of F (under fl) and, following the argument of <ref> [BR; Prop. 7.1] </ref>, show that, for every # 2 fi for which e # (ff) 62 (ff) for some ff 2 ZZ s , the summand e # p # is in the kernel of fl, hence can be omitted from the sum. <p> An example: box splines We discuss here an example in which we identify the spectrum of the preimage of H () for a box spline . For background about box splines we refer to <ref> [BR] </ref>, from where most of the notations are borrowed. Let be a finite index set. The (exponential) box spline B is defined via its Fourier transform as Y e fl ihx fl ;xi 1 ; where for each fl, fl 2 C and x fl 2 ZZ s n0. <p> We assume that spanfx fl g fl2 = IR s : Since C := (B fl) 1 (H (B )) is shift-invariant, its spectrum coincides (mod 2iZZ s ) with the set An important subset of fi was identified in [DM] and <ref> [BR] </ref> as the set e fi := f 2 C s : spanfx fl g fl2 e = C s g; with e := ffl 2 : r fl (e ) = 0g; (6.2) Proposition ([DM],[BR]). <p> For that we introduce, for each fl 2 , the differential operator D fl := D x fl fl , and note <ref> [BR] </ref> that D fl (B K fle ) = B Knfl flr fl (e ) for fl 2 K.

Reference-contexts: We assume that spanfx fl g fl2 = IR s : Since C := (B fl) 1 (H (B )) is shift-invariant, its spectrum coincides (mod 2iZZ s ) with the set An important subset of fi was identified in <ref> [DM] </ref> and [BR] as the set e fi := f 2 C s : spanfx fl g fl2 e = C s g; with e := ffl 2 : r fl (e ) = 0g; (6.2) Proposition ([DM],[BR]). <p> If so, it will follow that the finite set in (4.4)Theorem can be chosen as e fi=2iZZ s . Combining (6.3)Theorem with (4.8)Corollary, we obtain a result which was proved in <ref> [DM] </ref> by other means: (6.7) Corollary. C if finite dimensional if and only if its spectrum is e fi=2iZZ s .

Reference-contexts: In section 2, we review some analytic aspects of polynomial ideals, and in section 3 discuss the kind of ideal that appears in our context. Lefranc's <ref> [L] </ref> proof of the validity of spectral synthesis in C is provided (in a slightly modified version) in section 4. In section 5, we prove the above theorems and apply them to the special choices F = H (), F = ().
