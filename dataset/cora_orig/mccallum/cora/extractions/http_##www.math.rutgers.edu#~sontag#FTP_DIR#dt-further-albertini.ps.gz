Abstract: FURTHER RESULTS ON CONTROLLABILITY PROPERTIES OF DISCRETE-TIME NONLINEAR SYSTEMS fl ABSTRACT Controllability questions for discrete-time nonlinear systems are addressed in this paper. In particular, we continue the search for conditions under which the group-like notion of transitivity implies the stronger and semigroup-like property of forward accessibility. We show that this implication holds, pointwise, for states which have a weak Poisson stability property, and globally, if there exists a global "attractor" for the system.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper continues the study, initiated in [4] and then developed in <ref> [1] </ref>, of some controllability properties of discrete-time nonlinear systems, of the type: x (t + 1) = f (x (t); u (t)); t = 0; 1; 2; : : : ; (1) where x (t) 2 X and u (t) 2 U . <p> For instance, this is known when f is a rational map (see [5]), or when x 0 is a positively Poisson stable point for a some fixed diffeomorphism f (; u 0 ) (see <ref> [1] </ref>). In this paper we will strengthen considerably this last result, by proving the implication when x 0 has a weak type of Poisson stability. Moreover it is shown that transitivity implies forward accessibility when there exists a transitive state x 0 which is also a global "attractor" for . <p> In section 3 we associate to a discrete-time system some families of vector fields whose orbits will be correlated to the geometry of reachable sets and orbits. These families of vector fields are an extension of those considered in the previous work <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4] </ref>; we consider their introduction one of the main contributions of this paper. Section 4 presents some of the connections between the sets of vector fields so introduced and reachability. In section 5 we prove partial results for smooth systems. <p> It can be proved that, for analytic systems , U connected ) 8 x 2 X ; ~ R (x) is dense in R (x): (4) For the proof of (4) we refer to Proposition 3.3 of <ref> [1] </ref>; the basic idea is to combine the analyticity assumption, which guarantees that the set of control sequences giving maximal rank is open and dense, with the assumption that U clos int U , which gives that for each u 2 U there exists a sequence u n 2 int U <p> The following Lemma states a well known criterion for forward accessibility (for the proof see Proposition 3.2 in <ref> [1] </ref>). Lemma 2.2 Let be a smooth invertible system. For each x 2 X , the following are equivalent: 1. int R (x) 6= ;, There is an analogous result for the transitivity property. Lemma 2.3 Let be a smooth invertible system. <p> So, in particular, the previous result implies that, if the state space X is compact, then a system is transitive if and only if it is forward accessible. This result was proved in a very different way before, see <ref> [1] </ref> Theorem 2. <p> T 0 there exists some t &gt; T such that e tY (x) 2 V , where e tY () represents the flow of Y . 16 Analoguosly, one can define positive Poisson stability in discrete time, for a given diffeo--morphism f : X ! X , as done in <ref> [1] </ref>. Next we define a generalization of this concept to systems. <p> The following result generalizes <ref> [1] </ref> Theorem 1, which deals with the very special case of states which are positively Poisson stable for the diffeomorphism f 0 . The proof in this case requires the full machinary just introduced. Theorem 1 Let x 2 X be a positively Poisson stable point for .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper continues the study, initiated in <ref> [4] </ref> and then developed in [1], of some controllability properties of discrete-time nonlinear systems, of the type: x (t + 1) = f (x (t); u (t)); t = 0; 1; 2; : : : ; (1) where x (t) 2 X and u (t) 2 U . <p> Such systems arise, for instance, when dealing with continuous-time models under digital controls via sampling. For futher motivations of the study of this class we refer to <ref> [4] </ref>. If is a system of type (1), and x 0 is any state, then we can define the reachable set from x 0 , R (x 0 ), and the orbit from x 0 , O (x 0 ). <p> In section 3 we associate to a discrete-time system some families of vector fields whose orbits will be correlated to the geometry of reachable sets and orbits. These families of vector fields are an extension of those considered in the previous work <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4] </ref>; we consider their introduction one of the main contributions of this paper. Section 4 presents some of the connections between the sets of vector fields so introduced and reachability. In section 5 we prove partial results for smooth systems. <p> The second claim follows immediately from the first, by a similar argument. 3 A New Class of Vector Fields Associated to Systems Some Lie algebras of vector fields L; L ; L + ; ; ; + were introduced in <ref> [4] </ref> (see also [2] and [3] for previous work) to study the controllability properties of invertible systems. Here, using the same vector fields, we will define slightly different Lie algebras, which allow us to derive stronger results. Let be a given smooth invertible system. <p> + = fAd u k u 1 X + = fAd 11 u 0 ;i jk 0; 1 i m; u 0 ; : : : ; u k 2 U g; u k u 1 X * 0 (9) These previous definitions are the same as those given in <ref> [4] </ref>. For any finite sequence of controls = (v 1 ; ; v k ), we will denote by jj the length k of this sequence. <p> + v 1 Ad ff u;i j 1 l k; 1 i m; ff = 1; u 2 U g: Notice that, if = (0; ; 0), then the previous Lie algebras coincide respectively with the Lie algebras L + k ; L k , and L k defined in <ref> [4] </ref>. The way in which these algebras of vector fields will be used is as follows. <p> Moreover we will see that the notions of forward and backward accessibility, as well as transitivity, are related to the full dimensionality of the tangent subspaces at each point, corresponding to these families of vector fields (see Proposition 6.1). Along these lines, the following two results were proved in <ref> [4] </ref>, Corollary 4.4 and Theorem 2 part (a) respectively. We repeat their statements here for the convenience of the reader. Proposition 3.1 Let be a smooth invertible system. If y 2 ~ R (x), and dim Lie + (y) = n, then is forward accessible from x. <p> Let: = ff (; u)g u2U : Given these notations, the following fact holds (for the proof see Proposition 2.16 in [7]): Lemma 4.3 x 1 is weakly accessible from x 2 , x 1 2 Orb (x 2 ): The following result generalizes <ref> [4] </ref> Proposition 5.2, which deals with the very special case in which = 0; ; 0 | -z - . Proposition 4.4 Let k be any nonnegative integer. Assume that is a smooth system with connected U. Then: 1.

Reference-contexts: For discrete time systems it is known that, in general, this implication fails. However, for analytic discrete-time systems, there are some cases in which it has been already established that transitivity implies forward accessibility. For instance, this is known when f is a rational map (see <ref> [5] </ref>), or when x 0 is a positively Poisson stable point for a some fixed diffeomorphism f (; u 0 ) (see [1]). In this paper we will strengthen considerably this last result, by proving the implication when x 0 has a weak type of Poisson stability.

Moreover, if x is kforward accessible then, by the first result in Proposition 5.3, we have that Orb L + (x) is open.
