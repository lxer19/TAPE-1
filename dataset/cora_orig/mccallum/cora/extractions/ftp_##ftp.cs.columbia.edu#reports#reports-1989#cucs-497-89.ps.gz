Abstract: This paper analyzes recent research in the field of distributed file systems, with a particular emphasis on the problem of high availability. Several of the techniques involved in building such a system are discussed individually: naming, replication, multiple versions, caching, stashing, and logging. These techniques range from extensions of ideas used in centralized file systems, through new notions already in use, to radical ideas that have not yet been implemented. A number of working and proposed systems are described in conjunction with the analysis of each technique. The paper concludes that a low degree of replication, a liberal use of client and server caching, and optimistic behavior in the face of network failure are all necessary to ensure high availability.

Reference-contexts: Since Coda [Satyanarayanan 89] typically has an entire volume (all of a user's files) in its local disk cache, the cache actually doubles as a stash. The proposed FACE system <ref> [Alonso 89] </ref> maintains a stash that is distinct from its cache. A stash contains quasi-copies of a file: copies that may be somewhat out-of-date, but are never older than a certain fixed limit.

Reference-contexts: One must purchase twice as many drives and controllers as are actually needed. A similar problem dogs many distributed file systems. Replication - maintaining copies of each file on a number of machines - is a natural technique for increasing availability <ref> [Alsberg 76] </ref>. If one particular machine is down, a copy of the file can usually be retrieved from some other machine. Most of the time, however, the primary copy will be available, so the remaining copies will be 3 largely unused.
