Reference-contexts: In this case, we can express the uncertainty in e 0 as uncertainty in e 0 l , leaving e 0 a constant in the mathematical formalism. Henrion (1989) calls c l a leak cause for e. An example of causal independence is the noisy max relationship <ref> [Heckerman, 1993] </ref>. In this special case, each cause c i is binary, and the effect e and all variables e 0 i take on ordered states e0 &lt; e1 &lt; : : : &lt; em, and e 0 = e0. <p> The function f returns the state of e that is the maximum of its inputs. Another example of causal independence is the noisy adder <ref> [Heckerman, 1993] </ref>. In this case, each cause c i is binary, each variable e 0 i takes on integer states 0 &lt; 1 &lt; : : : &lt; m, and e 0 = 0. The function f returns the sum of its inputs.

Reference-contexts: Our strategy in this paper is to generate a series of approximations that more efficiently selects either an observation, a repair action, or the service-call action at each stage of the troubleshooting process.
