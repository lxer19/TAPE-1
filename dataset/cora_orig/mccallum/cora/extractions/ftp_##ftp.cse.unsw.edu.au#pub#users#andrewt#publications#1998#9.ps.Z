Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to the design of intelligent systems. A new framework is used in which the specification of the actual system is sought to be an interactive process taking place directly between the knowledge acquisition system and the domain expert. The need for a mediating knowledge engineer is reduced to an initial domain modelling stage. Furthermore, the interactions necessary between the expert and the KA system take place at a level that is as intuitive as possible to the expert. The emphasis of the types of systems we are addressing are KBS where search is an integral part of the problem solving process. Clearly defined combinatorial optimisation problems mark one end of the spectrum. The other end of the spectrum is marked by reducing the search process to just a single step, i.e. this covers also classification tasks. Intermediate problems being addressed are problems whose solution is probably best found by substantial search, however, where the criteria for an acceptable or even the best solution are difficult to define at the drawing board. Thus, the criteria for defined and refined during the initial use of the system. Our approach targets at the implicit representation of the less clearly definable quality criteria by allowing the expert to limit their input to the system to explanations of the steps in the expert search process. The explanations are used to construct a knowledge base representing search control knowledge. We are acquiring the knowledge in the context of its use, which substantially eases the knowledge acquisition process.

Reference-contexts: Any higher order description of a search state such as Excessive Tension, Engine Too Small, can be accommodated using Nested RDRs as it is done in SmS <ref> [Beydoun & Hoffmann, 1997] </ref>. A typical knowledge acquisition session may start with a case where the elevator car is big enough for ten people but the engine is too weak and the specification requires ten people. So, he may enter a rule: "If Engine Too Small then Engine Upgrade".

Reference-contexts: This knowledge base would classify which search states, to be generated by applying a given search operator, are worth pursuing in a given search state. The knowledge base is incrementally developed using a Ripple Down Rule based representation <ref> [Compton et al., 1992] </ref>. In SmS the case representation includes all the primitives describing the current state and the state transition operator which led to this state because this operator description is often needed by the expert to explain the current state.

Reference-contexts: Our knowledge acquisition takes place in the context of the actual use of the knowledge being specified by the expert. Previous experiments with acquiring classification knowledge in the context of its use has been highly successful <ref> [Compton et al.,1993] </ref>. Thus, we believe that the acquisition of search knowledge in the context of its use will be similarly effective in the general case and, as a consequence, that the general framework for problem-solving presented in this paper is widely applicable.

Reference-contexts: However, we argued that even problems like classification tasks fit into the framework, which involve virtually no search at all. While we are promoting a knowledge acquisition method based on Ripple-Down Rules, we approached the problem class of parametric design from a different angle as in <ref> [Compton et al.,1998] </ref>. In [Fensel ,1997] it was suggested to adapt a given problem solving method to a given domain and task. In our approach we took the extreme view by having just a single generic problem solver for a large class of search problems.

Reference-contexts: introduction of new terms into the language. This adds another dimension of flexibility to the language, and hence to the system. From the above discussion and adopting Fensel (et al)'s <ref> [Fensel et al.,1997] </ref> viewpoint of problem solving methods, that problem solving method are search engines adapted to a given domain, the adaptation in SmS across domains takes place in the following ways: * The operators and the ontological units in the domain specific search operators are created for the given domain <p> This problem provides a well-known example of a parametric design problem. Fensel (et al) <ref> [Fensel et al.,1997] </ref> present a detailed sketch of parametric design. Briefly, the design problem is to define values for a given set of interdependent parameters for which values must fall within given ranges and satisfy certain constraints given as a specification for the sought solution.
