Abstract: TECHNICAL REPORT ANL-93/34 Abstract. The properties of periodized Daubechies wavelets on [0; 1] are detailed and contrasted against their counterparts which form a basis for L 2 (R). Numerical examples illustrate the analytical estimates for convergence and demonstrate by comparison with Fourier spectral methods the superiority of wavelet projection methods for approximations. The analytical solution to inner products of periodized wavelets and their derivatives, which are known as connection coefficients, is presented, and several tabulated values are included.

Reference-contexts: An alternative approach developed by Latto, Resnikoff, and Tenenbaum <ref> [7] </ref> circumvents some of the difficulty by exploiting the scaling relation and the moment condition to reduce the calculation to an eigenvector problem. Their method is designed for nonperiodic compactly supported wavelets. <p> Here we follow the procedure outlined in <ref> [7] </ref>. The 2-tuple case will be shown in detail; it is a simple exercise to extend the method to the n-tuple situation. Several tabulated connection coefficients are included in the appendix. <p> Fix d; j 2 N, such that ' (d) j is well defined. To simplify notation, denote ' (d) k . In <ref> [7] </ref> it is suggested, without proof, that this method also holds for the first d for which d is discontinuous. For low-order differential equations, however, D 6 or D 8 wavelets should provide sufficient regularity.

Reference-contexts: These two results are strong, in contrast to the convergence properties of Fourier functional approximations. In fact it has been shown that the continuous functions whose Fourier series do not uniformly converge are dense in C (T) <ref> [10] </ref>. In this sense, wavelets provide a much more general basis than Fourier bases and hence have potentially broader applications. These results suggest that wavelets should do a better job at pointwise approximation, especially for continuous functions.
