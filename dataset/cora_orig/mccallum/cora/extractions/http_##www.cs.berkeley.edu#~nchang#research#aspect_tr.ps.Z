Abstract: This work addresses the complexities involved in aspectual composition by presenting a cognitively motivated analysis that makes use of active event representations. Verbs, arguments and temporal modifiers are characterized in terms of the conceptual features they impose or contribute to this framework, which employs representations of both motor-schematic and image-schematic change. By accommodating the inherently dynamic nature of temporal events and resource usage, this framework can not only make standard aspectual distinctions (e.g. between states and processes, or between perfective and imperfective processes) but also provide simple analyses of usually difficult aspectual phenomena. The representation also illuminates the interaction between event structure and nominals, which can instantiate pieces of the image-schematic representation or otherwise constrain possible interpretations. Cognitive explanations of event structure distinctions are made more concrete by illustration in the context of the Neural Theory of Language modeling project at the International Computer Science Institute (Feldman et al. 1996).

Reference-contexts: The models used here mix variants of Narayanan's APN notation with a representation for image schemas. APNs are made up of x-schemas, an extension of the Petri Net formalism <ref> (Murata 1989) </ref>. In this formalism, places (represented as circles) usually correspond to states, conditions or resources, and transitions (represented as rectangles) usually correspond to actions.

Reference-contexts: A number of verbs are explicitly aspectual, like stop, start and resume; others must be specified in the context of some other verb (such as stumble, which is construed in terms of interruption of a walking process <ref> (Narayanan 1997) </ref>). Any account of inherent verb meaning must somehow encompass all of these seemingly disparate varieties of change, and the specific context of aspectual composition is no exception.
