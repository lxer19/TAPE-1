Abstract: Branch Predictor Using Value Information Report on Research in Summer 98 Abstract Certain patterns of source code structures were identified [1] as common among branches with high misses. A close inspection of the branches suggests that using information from data value related to those branches may increase the prediction accuracy. Further more, for those branches inside a bracketing loop , using the value of induction variable of the loop proves to help better synchronizing value history with changes affecting the branch inside, thus help to increase the prediction accuracy significantly .

Reference-contexts: Once the associated register is known, we can obtain the register value to use together with branch history to index into the prediction table and make a prediction. Register value may not be immediately available. Past value or predicted (using a separate value predictor <ref> [9] </ref> ) value will need to be used.

Reference-contexts: Experiments need to be done to identify the top miss branches before we can analyze their patterns, decide what other information from a program can be used to increase prediction rate and how to use them. An in-order simulator from SimpleScalar <ref> [10] </ref> toolset is used, which can predict branch outcome, report predictor configuration and collect prediction miss rate for each static branch.
