Abstract: We present a coevolutionary architecture for solving decomposable problems and apply it to the evolution of artificial neural networks. Although this work is preliminary in nature it has a number of advantages over non-coevolutionary approaches. The coevolutionary approach utilizes a divide-and-conquer technique in which species representing simpler subtasks are evolved in separate instances of a genetic algorithm executing in parallel. Collaborations among the species are formed representing complete solutions. Species are created dynamically as needed. Results are presented in which the coevolutionary architecture produces higher quality solutions in fewer evolutionary trials when compared with an alternative non-coevolutionary approach on the problem of evolving cascade networks for parity computation.

Reference-contexts: In addition, individuals occasionally migrate from one subpopulation (island) to another, so there is a mixing of genetic material. The previous work that has looked at cooperating rather than competing subpop-ulations has involved a user-specified decomposition of the problem into species (see, for example, (Husbands and Mill 1991) or <ref> (Hills 1990) </ref>). Cooperative coevolutionary algorithms (CCAs) combine and extend ideas from these earlier systems in several ways. As shown in figure 1, a CCA consists of a collection of evolutionary algorithms, each attempting to evolve subcomponents (species) which are useful as modules for achieving higher level goals.
