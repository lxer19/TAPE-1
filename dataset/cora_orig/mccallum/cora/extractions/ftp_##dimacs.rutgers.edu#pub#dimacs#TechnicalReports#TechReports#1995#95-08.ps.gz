Reference-contexts: However, TSP is the most celebrated example of an NP-complete problem <ref> [1] </ref>, while it is hard to imagine an easier algorithm than Kruskal's greedy algorithm [5] for finding an optimal spanning tree. It is clear that in order to fully understand the problem one cannot just formalize it and forget about any of its specifics.

Reference-contexts: Thus, every greedy solution is optimal and possible ties can be resolved arbitrarily. Another example of this type is a well known scheduling problem denoted in standard notation by 1jp j j C j (e.g. see <ref> [2] </ref>): we are given n jobs with processing times p j which need to be scheduled on a single machine (one at a time) so that the sum of their completion times (or avarage completion time) is minimal.

Reference-contexts: More generally, the weights can measure preferences or priorities. For concreteness, we shall sometimes refer to the weights w e as priorities. Let us briefly introduce the language of measurement theory. There exsists an extensive literature on this subject (e.g. <ref> [4, 14, 6, 9, 10, 11] </ref>), and we will follow Roberts [11]. A scale of measurement is a mapping which assigns (positive) real numbers to objects being measured in such a way that certain empirical relations are preserved.

Reference-contexts: In many cases, only a slight modification of the Greeedy Algorithm will eliminate greedy solutions which are not optimal. Therefore, information that priorities can be measured on an ordinal scale is valuable and can be the main step towards finding an efficient optimization algorithm. Mahadev, Pekec, and Roberts <ref> [7, 8] </ref> consider a specific scheduling problem arising from the problems at the Air Mobility Command of the Unites States Air Force: n items need to be assigned arrival dates in such a way that no two items have the same arrival date.

Mahadev, Pekec and Roberts analyze the meaningfulness of the conclusion of optimality for a variety of Penalty functions. For example they show in <ref> [8] </ref> that for the problem where a 1 = a 2 = : : : = a n1 &lt; a n and where the penalty for a schedule x is given by P (x; t) = i=1 for some increasing function h, the conclusion of optimality is meaningful if priorities are

Reference-contexts: In measurement theory, we call a statement using scales meaningful if its truth or falsity is unchanged after applying admissible transformations to all of the scales in the statement. The meaningfulness of the conclusion of optimality for combinatorial optimization problems was studied by Roberts in <ref> [12, 13] </ref>. In this paper we analyze the problems where data is assigned positive real numbers and is measured on an ordinal scale - 2 - In the next section we will formulate our problem and introduce additional terminology.
