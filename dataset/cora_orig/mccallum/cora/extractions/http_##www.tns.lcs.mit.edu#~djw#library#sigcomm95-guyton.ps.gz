Reference: [1] <author> Michael Accetta. </author> <title> RFC 887: Resource location protocol, </title> <month> December </month> <year> 1983. </year>
Reference-contexts: While it is impossible to cover them all, we present two representative examples here. Accetta defined a server location protocol intended to be used on top of whatever network protocols are available (e.g., UDP datagrams or broadcasts) <ref> [1] </ref>. The Eden system used a combination of broadcasts and hint caching to locate objects [2]. From the perspective of the current paper, a key limitation of these systems is that none of them considered network topology; they focused on local area networks.

Reference-contexts: In his thesis he defined a directed broadcast mechanism by which a host could send a broadcast to a particular network, and an expanding ring broadcast mechanism which allowed broadcasts to increasingly large concentric rings around the broadcasting host <ref> [3] </ref>. Xerox later incorporated expanding ring broadcasts into their Network Binding Protocol [7]. More recent approaches have considered various forms of multicast routing.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we address the large middle ground. For example, at present there are over 11,000 Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers reachable on the Internet, but the load among these servers is poorly distributed [10]. Other examples of highly replicated Internet services include Harvest Brokers and Caches <ref> [4] </ref>. We consider a range of techniques, ranging from routing-layer multicast and its derivatives, to application layer techniques using network probes ala "ping" [15] and "traceroute" [13] to gather the server location database. <p> This approach clearly does not segregate traffic by network region, but is effective in reducing server loading problems. It is being used, for example, by NCSA for their popular WWW server, and by Harvest Brokers <ref> [4] </ref>. Another simple strategy is to configure routing topologies manually. While labor intensive, this approach is widely used, for example in the MBONE [6] and USENET [14].

Reference-contexts: More recently, a number of systems have been developed that use geographical information to approximate network topology considerations. These include Braun and Claffy's DNS mapping scheme <ref> [5] </ref>, Gwertzman and Margo Seltzer's geographical push-caching scheme [11]. As noted in Section 1, this approach is effective when there are few replicas. Because network topology often does not correspond to geographic proximity, in general this approach may not work well.

Reference-contexts: Xerox later incorporated expanding ring broadcasts into their Network Binding Protocol <ref> [7] </ref>. More recent approaches have considered various forms of multicast routing. That is, given a multicast group joined by all instances of a particular type of server, one can choose the server that responds most quickly to a group multicast message.

Our experimental results focus on the Internet, both because it provides a measurable environment, and because of the practical importance of replicating Internet services. We begin in Section 2 by considering a range of server location approaches. <p> To provide a realistic topology, we began with a list of 11,000 Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers on the Internet, as discovered by an earlier survey <ref> [10] </ref>. We coalesced this graph to one server per IP network, to reduce the Internet load needed to determine the topology, and to reduce the scale of the simulation.

The intuition is illustrated in Figure 2. As measured from B, S could be located either at s 0 or at s 00 , and C could be either at c 0 or c 00 . <p> What it can do is place bounds on the minimum and maximum distances between two measured points <ref> [12] </ref>. These bounds can be used as an initial filter, with clients selecting among the resulting subset by measuring their own distances to each of the remaining replicated servers.

Reference-contexts: Since it is wasteful to transmit a message to an entire group to locate only a few servers, Partridge et al. have proposed an anycasting mechanism, which attempts to deliver to one nearby host <ref> [16] </ref>. While the details of anycasting have yet to be worked out, we observe that anycasting should develop routing information proactively. <p> At the routing layer the location database can be constructed incrementally by monitoring routing update traffic and group join/leave requests.
