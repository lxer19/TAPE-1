Abstract: The structure of spacetime duality and discrete worldsheet symmetries of compactified string theory is examined within the framework of noncommutative geometry. The full noncommutative string spacetime is constructed using the Frohlich-Gaw~edzki spectral triple which incorporates the vertex operator algebra of the string theory. The duality group appears naturally as a subgroup of the automorphism group of the vertex operator algebra and spacetime duality is shown to arise as the possibility of associating two independent Dirac operators, arising from the chiral structure of the worldsheet theory, to the noncommutative geometry.

Reference-contexts: Typeset using REVT E X fl Permanent Address: Dipartimento di Scienze Fisiche, Universita di Napoli Federico II y Work supported in part by NSERC (Canada). 1 (June 26, 1997) One of the key tools to the understanding of the spacetime structure of string theory is the concept of `duality' (see <ref> [1] </ref> for a review). A duality in string theory relates a geometry of the target space in which the strings live to an inequivalent one. The mapping between distinct geometries is a symmetry of the quantum string theory. <p> spacetime, general covariance implies that the two spacetimes represented by the corresponding spectral triples are equivalent, (H; A; D) ~ = (H; A; D) (5) More complicated duality symmetries can also be constructed by introducing a larger set of Dirac operators associated with, say, an N = 2 supersymmetric sigma-model <ref> [1] </ref> which contains a larger symmetry than just the chiral-antichiral one exploited above. The spacetime duality maps T are, by definition, those which preserve the low-energy spectral triple T 0 . <p> It corresponds to an inversion of the background matrices d ! (d ) 1 and is the d-dimensional analog of the R ! 1=R circle duality <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Dualities have been exploited recently to relate apparently distinct string theories. A present model for the spacetime structure of superstring theory is `M Theory' <ref> [2] </ref> which subsumes all five consistent superstring theories in ten dimensions via duality transformations and contains 11-dimensional supergravity as its low-energy limit. T-duality, which relates large and small radius circles, leads to a fundamental length scale in string theory, determined by the Planck length l P . <p> They can also be generalized to include worldsheet gravitational effects and more complicated target space geometries [7], as well as to obtain duality maps between different spectral triples representing the equivalences of distinct string theories and D-brane models as dictated by M Theory <ref> [2] </ref>. The duality group is a subgroup of the full group of automorphisms of the algebra A which represents the diffeomorphism and internal symmetries of the stringy general relativity.

Reference-contexts: The string configurations are conjectured to be smeared out and the notion of a `point' in the spacetime ceases to make sense. A recent candidate theory for this picture is the effective matrix field theory for D-branes <ref> [3] </ref> in which the spacetime coordinates are described by noncommuting matrices. In this Letter we shall discuss how the effective string spacetime and its associated dualities can be described using the techniques of noncommutative geometry [4].

Reference-contexts: In this Letter we shall discuss how the effective string spacetime and its associated dualities can be described using the techniques of noncommutative geometry <ref> [4] </ref>. These mathematical tools are particularly well-suited to the study of the structure of the stringy spacetime, in that it views it not as a set of coordinates, but rather in terms of the set of fields defined on it.

For this we exploit the operator-state correspondence which relates the Hilbert space H X to an appropriate operator algebra.

Reference-contexts: The noncommutativity of the algebra A X is expressed in terms of the operator product expansion formula of the vertex operators, which in turn encodes the complete set of relations of the quantum field algebra and of A X <ref> [7] </ref>. The vertex operators (3) generate all string scattering amplitudes, and so the noncommutative algebra A X represents the "space" of interacting strings. Finally, we introduce a Dirac operator. The chiral-antichiral decomposition in (1) allows two such operators to be introduced. <p> The C fl -algebra A = I A X acts trivially on the spinor part of H. We then define two mutually anticommuting Dirac operators by D (z ) = 2fl 1 X p ff k z k with ff () - . The Dirac operators (4) are related <ref> [7] </ref> to Witten's Dirac-Ramond operator associated with N = 1 superstrings [8]. These Dirac operators have been used recently by Chamseddine in [9] to construct an effective superstring action using the spectral action principle of noncommutative geometry [10]. <p> There are many other symmetries that arise from such isomorphisms, corresponding to mappings from H () 0 onto other subspaces of ker D. For example, worldsheet parity and factorized duality (equivalently mirror symmetry when d is even) easily arise in this way <ref> [7] </ref>. Besides these geometrical symmetries, there are two other internal symmetries of the spacetime which trivially leave the spectral triples in (5) invariant. The first is a change of basis of the lattice , a process which preserves all quantities composing the spectral triples. <p> The above constructions thus show how the geometry and topology relevant for general relativity must be embedded in a larger noncommutative structure in string theory. They can also be generalized to include worldsheet gravitational effects and more complicated target space geometries <ref> [7] </ref>, as well as to obtain duality maps between different spectral triples representing the equivalences of distinct string theories and D-brane models as dictated by M Theory [2]. <p> Thus the full set of symmetries of the string spacetime is intimately connected with some of the exotic mathematical structures which appear in the theory of vertex operator algebras, such as the Monster Lie algebra [11]. More details about these constructions will appear in a forthcoming paper <ref> [7] </ref>. 10 (June 26, 1997)
