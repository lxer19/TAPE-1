Abstract: Data mining, or knowledge discovery, has recently become a popular research area. Data mining methods have been applied to a wide variety of domains, from supermarket basket data and telecommunication alarm data to the analysis of satellite pictures and human genomes. Surprisingly enough, only a few examples of data mining in text are available. However, considering the amount of existing document collections, text mining would be most useful. Traditionally, texts have been analysed using various information retrieval related methods, such as full-text analysis, and natural language processing. In this paper, we present our first experiments in applying general methods of data mining to discovering phrases and co-occurring terms. We also describe the text mining process developed. Our results show that data mining methods | with appropriate preprocessing | can be used in text processing, and that by shifting the focus the process can be used to obtain results for various purposes.

Reference-contexts: give a brief description of episodes and episode rules and some reference to the methods used for their discovery. 2.1 Episodes Episode rules and episodes are a modification of the concept of association rules and frequent sets, applied to sequential data. (For the basic definitions of association rules, see, e.g., <ref> [AMS + 96] </ref>.) Sequential data can be seen as a sequence of events, where each event is a pair (event type, time).

Reference-contexts: In addition to simple queries, content descriptors can be used for various text classification tasks. For instance, documents can be clustered according to their similarity, to visualize a large document collection <ref> [CKPT92] </ref>. Also a query result can be clustered to give a better overall view of the documents retrieved. Moreover, the user can choose some of the resulting documents, and ask the system to find other documents that are somehow similar to them.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, data mining from existing document collections, including the World Wide Web, which contains large amounts of semi-structured text in Html format, would be most useful. Surprisingly enough, only a few examples of data mining in text analysis are available. The most notable are the Kdt and Fact systems <ref> [FDK96] </ref> used in mining Reuters news articles.

Reference-contexts: Referring to the results in different domain areas and applications, preprocessing can take as much as 80 per cent of the total effort [Man96]. In the context of our knowledge presentation formats, a Kdd process, adapted, e.g., from <ref> [FPSS96] </ref>, consists of 1. Data preprocessing (selection, cleaning, etc.), 2. Data transformation and input selection for discovery phase, 3. Discovery of episodes and episode rules, 4. Presentation of the results, and 5. Interpretation and utilization of the results.

Reference-contexts: Discovery of co-occurring words has applications within several fields. For instance, in information retrieval | or more specifically text retrieval | keywords and key phrases are commonly used to boost query processing <ref> [Sal88, LSJ96] </ref>. Consider a common information retrieval task: The user expresses his/her information needs, e.g., by giving a query, and the system executes the search by matching the query with the documents. With large collections simply scanning the text is not feasible. <p> Although indexing and selecting keywords are well-studied within information retrieval, new challenges have been recently set by the sudden appearance of very large heterogeneous full text document collections. Lewis and Sparck Jones <ref> [LSJ96] </ref> consider compound keyterms as one essential possibility to improve the quality of text retrieval in the new situation. <p> They also emphasise the need of exhaustive experimenting: "Experiments are needed to determine the precise form of these compound terms and how they should be selected and weighted, say, relative to their constituents." <ref> [LSJ96] </ref> In this paper, we present our first experiments in applying general methods of data mining to discovering phrases and co-occurring terms. We also describe the text mining process developed.

Reference-contexts: To get appropriate data for the analysis, substantial effort must usually be directed to the preprocessing phase. Referring to the results in different domain areas and applications, preprocessing can take as much as 80 per cent of the total effort <ref> [Man96] </ref>. In the context of our knowledge presentation formats, a Kdd process, adapted, e.g., from [FPSS96], consists of 1. Data preprocessing (selection, cleaning, etc.), 2. Data transformation and input selection for discovery phase, 3. Discovery of episodes and episode rules, 4. Presentation of the results, and 5.

Reference-contexts: More elaborate ways of utilizing co-occurrent terms can be found in natural language processing techniques. A specific class of co-occurring terms are so-called collocations, i.e., recurrent combinations of words that correspond to arbitrary word usages <ref> [Sma93] </ref>. Opposite to typical phrases used in information retrieval, collocations may often contain prepositions and inflected words. In addition to the linguistic interest, collocations may be useful in retrieval tasks.
