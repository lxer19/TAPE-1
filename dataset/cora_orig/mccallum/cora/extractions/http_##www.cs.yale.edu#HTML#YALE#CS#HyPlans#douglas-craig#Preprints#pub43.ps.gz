Abstract: In this paper, we extend some results from an earlier paper (SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 30 (1993), pp. 136-158) of the first two authors. We provide a unified theory for multilevel and multigrid methods when the usual assumptions are not present. For example, we do not assume that the solution spaces or the grids are nested. Further, we do not assume that there is an algebraic relationship between the linear algebra problems on different levels. What we provide is a computationally useful theory for adaptively changing levels. Theory is provided for multilevel correction schemes, nested iteration schemes, and one way (i.e., coarse to fine grid with no correction iterations) schemes. We include examples showing the applicability of this theory: finite element examples using quadrature in the matrix assembly and finite volume examples with non-nested grids. Our theory applies directly to finite difference, wavelet, and collocation based multilevel examples as well.

Reference-contexts: The theory here is more precise than the earlier one. Further, it is applicable to problems that are not nested and/or ones in which the linear systems use quadrature in their assembly. Finally, the theory here allows multigrid software (e.g., <ref> [3] </ref>) adaptively to change levels with a higher degree of precision than with the earlier theory. 12 C. C. Douglas et al.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION In this paper, some concepts and theory first developed in <ref> [4] </ref> are extended. We do not make many assumptions in this paper. In particular, the grids do not necessarily have to be nested. The norms correspond to inner products on a grid, but the inner products do not have to be identical from level to level. <p> For partial differential equations that are discretized in a standard fashion, there can be natural definitions for R k+1 and P k . Some of these are shown graphically in <ref> [4] </ref>. For most finite difference schemes, P k is related to a conventional linear interpolation scheme; R k+1 usually corresponds to a weighted average of neighboring points. Many times, R k+1 = cP T k , where c 2 IR. See Figure 1 for an example set of grids. <p> Once again, see Figure 1 for an example set of grids or <ref> [4] </ref>. For many finite volume schemes, P k and R k+1 are similar to the ones in the finite element case. While the grids are nested, the location of the unknowns in the matrix problem are not necessarily nested. <p> The solvers can be smoothers, roughers, or direct solvers. In order to analyze Algorithm MG from an iterative method viewpoint, we transform it into a nonstandard form similar to that introduced in <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> A k (^x (i) (i) (i) (4e) Post-solve: Update ^x (i) (i) (i) k such that A k x k + R k+1 z k+1 = z k , where kz (i) (i) (i) (5) Return x ( k ) This is almost the same algorithm as was analyzed in <ref> [4] </ref>. The difference is in step (4c). Here we calculate the norm of the difference between the effect of two similar operators on the correction with respect to the residual before the correction was computed. Consider the example of adaptively changing levels based on reducing the residual norm adequately. <p> z k1 k (i) (i) (i) ( k1 ) (i) (i) (i) (i) ( k1 ) (i1) so that kz k k k E k kz k+1 k k+1 : A more precise analysis, based on an affine space decomposition of each M k , would follow the analysis in <ref> [4] </ref>. The basic theorem for Algorithm NSNI is the following: Theorem 2. Make the same assumptions as in Theorem 1. Further assume that (1.1) is approximated by some ~ k such that A k ~ k + f k = k (2.2) 8 C. C.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, one would not use a multigrid approach to solve this problem. However, multigrid is a viable alternative for the equivalent multi-dimensional problem. The following remarks generalize to the multi-dimensional case through the use of tensor product formulations for the prolongation and restriction operators (see <ref> [5] </ref> for applications). We discuss the one-dimensional case for clarity.

Reference-contexts: Choosing ` = 0, all `, corresponds to one way multigrid, i.e., no correction cycles whatsoever (see [2] and <ref> [6] </ref>). <p> The one way multigrid method is a common computational method in engineering applications. It has been used for decades as a method for producing an initial guess on the grid in which a solution to a problem is actually wanted. This process is described in <ref> [6] </ref> for a procedure that he first saw in the 1920's. Consider a typical partial differential equation problem to be solved numerically. It is discretized on a set of grids k , 1 k j, with some notion of grid spacing (or a mesh diameter) h k .
