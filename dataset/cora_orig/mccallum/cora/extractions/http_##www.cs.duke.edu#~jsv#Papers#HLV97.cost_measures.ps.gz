Abstract: We present and compare methods for choosing motion vectors for block-based motion-compensated video coding. The primary focus is on videophone and video-conferencing applications, where low bit rates are necessary, where motion is usually limited, and where the amount of computation is also limited. In a typical block-based motion-compensated video coding system, motion vectors are transmitted along with a lossy encoding of the residuals. As the bit rate decreases, the proportion required to transmit the motion vectors increases. We provide experimental evidence that choosing motion vectors explicitly to minimize rate (including motion vector coding), subject to implicit constraints on distortion, yields better rate-distortion tradeoffs than minimizing some measure of prediction error. Minimizing a combination of rate and distortion yields further improvements. Although these explicit-minimization schemes are computationally intensive, they provide invaluable insight which we use to develop practical algorithms. We show that minimizing a simple heuristic function of the prediction error and the motion vector code-length results in rate-distortion performance comparable to explicit-minimization schemes while being computationally feasible. Experimental results are provided for coders that operate within the H.261 standard.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the H.263 standard is similar enough to H.261 that it seems clear that these methods will work well with H.263. As a case in point, the bit-minimization strategy has been applied in <ref> [12] </ref> within a non-standard quadtree-based coder that chooses motion vectors to optimize a hierarchical encoding of the motion information within a block-matching framework with variable block sizes.

Reference-contexts: RD minimizes the objective function: C RD (~v; ~c) = B (~v; ~c) + D (~v; ~c): (1) If B (~v; ~c) and D (~v; ~c) for each block were independent of the choices of ~v and ~c for previously coded blocks, results of Shoham and Gersho <ref> [17] </ref> imply that an objective function of the form (1) would minimize distortion subject to a rate constraint. Since in p fi 64 a motion vector is coded with reference to a previously coded motion vector, there is some dependence at the macroblock level. <p> Since in p fi 64 a motion vector is coded with reference to a previously coded motion vector, there is some dependence at the macroblock level. Therefore, minimizing (1) locally for each block is globally suboptimal in the rate-distortion sense. With this caveat noted, we proceed as in <ref> [17] </ref>. In principle, we should choose based upon the theoretical rate-distortion curve for the input video. A good choice is to set to be equal to the negative of the slope of the line tangent to the distortion vs. rate curve at the desired operating point. <p> This way we are optimizing in a direction perpendicular to the rate-distortion curve at the operating point. The rate-distortion curve can be estimated, for example, by preprocessing a portion of the input video. An online iterative search method could also be used <ref> [17] </ref>. In our experiments, we code the test sequence several times with different quantizer step sizes to estimate the rate-distortion function, and fix based upon the slope of the function at the desired rate. Our purpose is to explore the performance improvement offered by such an approach. D.

Reference-contexts: B.2 Adaptive Cost Function The above results rely on pre-training the model parameters c i for each value of Q for each video sequence. This is a tedious and time-consuming operation. Instead, we can use an adaptive on-line technique, such as the Widrow-Hoff learning rule <ref> [18] </ref>, [19], to train the model parameters. The training examples could be generated each time we encode a macroblock using motion compensation mode. However, we cannot possibly hope to train one model for each value 5 Fig. 3.

Reference-contexts: We need a single model whose parameters are independent of Q. The curve fitting results from the pre-training trials show a strong correlation between the model parameters and Q 1 . This agrees well with previous work on rate-quantization modeling <ref> [20] </ref>. Therefore we propose the following form for the cost function: H (~; Q) = c 1 Q This can be simplified as H ( ) = c 1 + c 2 ; (8) (a) Miss America (b) Claire Fig. 6.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, with the H2 coder, which applies bit-minimization to coding control, the number of bits used for coding side information is also reduced. V. Related Work In related work, Chung, Kossentini and Smith <ref> [21] </ref> consider rate-distortion optimizations for motion estimation in a hybrid video coder based upon subband coding and block-matching motion compensation. The input frames are first decomposed into subbands, which are divided into 10 (c) H1-WH (d) H2-WH Fig. 10.

Reference-contexts: Only the luminance component is shown. uniform rectangular blocks. For each block, a Lagrangian cost function is used to select between intraframe and in-terframe modes and to select between a small number of candidate motion vectors, which are coded with a lossy two-dimensional vector quantizer. In <ref> [22] </ref>, rate-distortion optimization is applied to the selection of coding control for low-bit-rate video coding under the H.263 standard, a newer standard than the H.261 standard that we consider here. A greedy optimization strategy is adopted to avoid the exponential complexity that a global optimization would entail.

Reference-contexts: Even with simplifying assumptions, the rate-distortion optimization is computationally complex and may not be suitable for real-time implementation, as the authors freely admit. Ribas-Corbera and Neuhoff <ref> [23] </ref> describe a procedure for minimizing rate in a lossless motion-compensated video coder. They explore the allocation of bits between the coding of motion vectors and the coding of prediction error.

Reference-contexts: It is not clear whether this work can be extended to lossy coding since distortion is not taken into account in the formulation. A linear relationship between MAD and both rate and distortion has been independently observed in <ref> [24] </ref>. The authors mention the possibility of performing motion vector search to minimize the bit rate, but conclude that just minimizing MAD would have a similar effect. VI.

Reference-contexts: Thus, it seems that fixing is safe in practice. Still, since influences rate to some extent, it can be used in conjunction with the quantization step size in performing rate control. Automatic control of based upon buffer feedback as described in <ref> [25] </ref> is a possibility. Although the methods presented here have been implemented within the H.261 standard, it should be generally applicable to any video coder that employs motion compensation in a low bit rate setting.
