Title: On First-Order Two-Dimensional Linear Homogeneous Partial Difference Equations  
Author: G. Neil Haven Dmitri A. Gusev 
Abstract: Analysis of algorithms occasionally requires solving of first-order two-dimensional linear homogeneous partial difference equations. We survey solutions to special cases of the linear recurrence equation (am + bn + c)F m;n = (dm + en + f)F m1;n + (gm + hn + i)F m1;n1 in terms of known functions and establish equivalences between unsolved cases. The article also reviews solution techniques used to simplify recurrences and establish equivalences between them.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The standard form for the recurrence equation we will be considering is x (m; n)F m;n = y (m; n)F m1;n + z (m; n)F m1;n1 : Recurrences of this form arise in problems related to analysis of algorithms and combinatorics (see, for example, <ref> [7] </ref>, Sections 6.3.1 and 8.2). <p> In fact, there are many more sources, because the functions under consideration are extremely common. 1.

We also provide references to sources where one may read more about these functions (how to compute them, their properties, etc.).
