Abstract This paper presents an approach for solving the inherent problem with multicast routing scalability - by cooperation between endsystems and the network. We introduce an extremely efficient, elegant way to name arbitrary sized inter-meshed aggregations of multicast addresses. This is done in such a way that it is easy to calculate how to change the name to encompass many more related names. We describe how these aggregate names could be used anywhere in place of the set of addresses to which they refer, not by resolving them into multiple operations, but by a single bulk action throughout the routing tree, and in session descriptions potentially including those for reservations. Initial aggregation in endsystems might only reduce the problem by an order of magnitude, but it is believed that this will provide sufficient structure for routers to be able to recognise further aggregation potential. To improve the chances of router aggregation, address set allocation schemes must fulfil certain criteria that are laid down in this paper.

Reference-contexts: A large class of applications utilises multiple multicast addresses internally. Further, many such applications consist of varying sets of multiple multicast groups that are all subsets of a bigger set (e.g. news, stock-feeds, network games, virtual worlds, distributed simulations, all applications using layered multicast <ref> [1] </ref>). Any solution should ensure that such "nucleating applications" use aggregations of addresses that can be identified as such. Related work is described later. Most is in the area of straightforward multicast address allocation, which is, perhaps surprisingly, far from being sorted out.

Reference-contexts: Scheme Description The proposed scheme for identifying aggregates of multicast addresses builds directly on IP multicasting <ref> [2] </ref>. The scheme assigns a new meaning to (a number that looks like) any existing multicast address, but only when it is in in a context associated with (at least) two other parameters that define aggregation size.

Reference-contexts: This would point to where the mask started.

The two potentially masked octets would then have to be built into another similar lookup table. Finding any one address in this structure would again be akin to the longest prefix (shortest mask) problem.

Reference-contexts: For example, if A 1 2 3 in Fig 2 were the three AMAs respectively: (a,m,17), (a,m,0, 31,42), (a,m,0, 20,37) then the routing table entry for the super-AMA (a,m,42) with respect to source S would be: a, m, S, <ref> [(0, 17, f ,), (20, 42, f ,)] </ref>, 4 5 6 ,)], misc When a packet arrives at the incoming interface, it's destination is matched against the AMA associated with each outgoing interface.

Evolution from current versions of protocols needs more careful analysis. The design of an AMA scheme for IPv6 <ref> [18] </ref> needs to be done. ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) multicast may benefit from a scheme based on similar thinking? 5.

Reference-contexts: This limits the sets of interesting multicast addresses to AMAs that are related to the one in use. This is a limitation of the AMA scheme when compared to schemes based on arbitrary masks such as <ref> [19] </ref> (which has different limitations discussed under Related work). However, this was a concious compromise to avoid the larger storage needed for arbitrary masks as opposed to contiguous ones. <p> Address allocation mechanisms (such as AAP or M-DHCP (see below)) will listen to announcements and allocate addresses to sessions appropriately. A possibility being investigated for MASC address range allocation is "Kampai style" addressing <ref> [19] </ref> which uses a noncontinuous mask to define the allocated range so is more flexible when range sizes need to be arbitrarily increased or decreased. However, Kampai-style addressing allocates ranges in sizes that are powers of two and hence could be very wasteful where large ranges are concerned.

Reference-contexts: Thus there is currently no standard mechanism for address allocation, but the author of the sd tools recently agreed to publish the address allocation mechanism from sdr as a separate protocol - Address Allocation Protocol (AAP) <ref> [20] </ref> - which could be incorporated into other address allocators. Microsoft created an alternative means for allocation of multicast addresses by extending their Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, originally designed to allocate temporary unicast addresses.

Reference-contexts: the multicast address allocation proposals are distinct from unicast in the following aspects: No fixed assignments of address ranges to IP domains - address ranges are claimed as needed Random allocation of addresses to sessions within a domain Allocations of addresses have finite lifetimes The MASC (Multicast Address Set Claim) <ref> [21] </ref> is one such proposal. This is work in progress but the outline of the mechanism as described by the authors is as follows: 1. <p> Address ranges will be allocated for a set lifetime and in such a way that they may be aggregated. Allocation will take account of administratively scoped multicast addresses. 3. The ISP then advertises this address range to other domains using BGP4++ <ref> [21] </ref> (or similar mechanism). All border routers will thus hear these announcements. It waits a certain time, however, (typ. 3 days) before using the address range, to detect collisions 4. Address allocation mechanisms (such as AAP or M-DHCP (see below)) will listen to announcements and allocate addresses to sessions appropriately. <p> Address ranges are associated (at least temporarily) with domains, allocated using the MASC mechanism described above. 2.

Thus, multicast address ranges will be advertised in much the same way as unicast IPv4 NLRIs are advertised in BGP4 now. They will be advertised at least a day in advance of use, to enable any clashes of address allocation to be resolved. 3.

Reference-contexts: Although there is brief consideration of a way to remove this restriction, it is admitted it will be more complex and hasn't been thought through.

Address ranges are associated (at least temporarily) with domains, allocated using the MASC mechanism described above. 2. These address ranges will be advertised globally. The proposal is that BGP4 will be used for this, given the proposed Multiprotocol Extensions [21].

Reference-contexts: The latter would be necessary if the tree were source-based, but it may be possible for the allocation service (or some other service) to suggest the best tree root position if using core-based multicast. 2.3 Further storage optimisation (for IPv4) Optimisations considered but rejected are recorded elsewhere <ref> [25] </ref>. 2.3.1 Mask width, m In the contexts where AMAs are used, the first four bits of the address are redundant, as a non-multicast address wouldn't make sense. m is the natural candidate to store in place of this 1110 bit pattern which is fixed for IPv4 (class D) addresses (but <p> BGMP then assumes an inter-domain shared tree, for which the `root domain' (the focal domain of the shared tree) is the domain owning the address. Some alternative ideas generated while preparing this paper (but rejected in favour of the scheme presented) are recorded elsewhere <ref> [25] </ref> 4. Limitations and Further Work The ability to do large-scale aggregation is based on hope that higher level organisation will be achieved. This scheme "feels" as if it is a good foundation for solutions to these problems, but the author can't give any guarantees without more work.

Reference-contexts: It should also be possible to grow or shrink the size of the set identified by the name, while avoiding clashes with addresses in use by other sessions. An informal list of further requirements of address allocation schemes, which are not directly relevant to the discussion here, is at <ref> [26] </ref>. These aggregation names should themselves be open to aggregation, implying the naming should be recursive. Otherwise the smallscale clustering that the "nucleating applications" will be able to engender, will simply result in these small clusters collecting in routers deeper into the network.

Reference-contexts: It is possible that m is redundant, but it is believed that keeping it will make the aggregation maths a lot easier . Applicability of AMAs as a solution to reliable multicast clustering/layering needs assessment. Applicability of AMAs for aggregation in RSVP (reservation protocol) <ref> [27] </ref> when used for multicast needs assessment. Further work is needed on the potential for using AMAs to insulate upstream routers from high join/leave churn by introducing pessimistic inertia in the aggregation. The effect on leave latency (particularly where used for congestion control in layered multicast) would need careful study.
