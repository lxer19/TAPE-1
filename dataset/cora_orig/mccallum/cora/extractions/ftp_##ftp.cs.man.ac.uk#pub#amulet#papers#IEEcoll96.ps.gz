Abstract: If asynchronous technology is to have a role in the future of the electronics industry there are several challenges which we, its principal proponents, must meet: 1. We must demonstrate the technical merits of asynchronous design. This requires that circuits of commercially relevant complexity are developed and that they show, convincingly, some advantage over comparable clocked designs. Building large-scale circuits is an expensive undertaking and beyond the capability of many (though not all) academic groups. 2. We must develop efficient design methodologies for asynchronous circuits. Even if asynchronous circuits can be shown to have advantages, this will not lead to commercial take-up if design costs are high. The Philips Tangram experience suggests that it is possible to build design tools for asynchronous circuits that are more efficient than those for clocked circuits, but much remains to be done. 3. We must develop production testing strategies for asynchronous circuits. Design for testability techniques The last decade has seen a remarkable growth in the interest in asynchronous techniques, despite the paucity of demonstrations of merit and the design and test difficulties. Some companies now appear ready to accept the risks for the potential benefits, and an atmosphere of expectancy has arisen which may not be sustainable for long. I think we will see asynchronous designs gain a significant commercial foothold over the next five years, attracting the level of resource which is required to make them competitive. If they fail, a new dark age will descend, but if they succeed we will have changed one of the fundamental precepts of our industry. Whilst asynchronous design has perceived advantages over clocked design, there is a marked shortage of convincing demonstrations that these advantages apply to practical designs of commercial interest. We need considerably more concrete evidence that asynchronous circuits can be designed and tested at competitive cost and then have real benefits; without this, most of the worlds design community will continue to view asynchronous techniques as academic curiosities pursued only for their qualities of truth and beauty. Unfortunately, developing competitive designs requires a level of resource which is rarely available to academics. We must therefore grasp the opportunity which is presented by the current level of industrial interest in our work and be prepared to face the commercial pressures which are associated with getting involved in product development. If we decline this opportunity, the next may be a long time coming! such as built-in and scan-based test circuitry are beginning to appear, but again there is much to be done.

Reference: 1. <author> Power-efficiency. </author> <title> Clocks beat away, causing power dissipation whether or not the circuit is doing useful work. Clock gating and dividing alleviates this problem, but only on a coarse granularity. An asynchronous circuit is inherently data driven and only uses power for useful work. </title>
Reference: 2. <author> Modularity. </author> <title> A clock is a global variable; merging two design components which were developed with different clock requirements is very difficult. Asynchronous circuits have clean interfaces and avoid this problem. </title>
Reference: 3. <author> Performance. </author> <title> The clock must be set so that the slowest logic stage can complete within a clock period under worst-case processing, data and environmental conditions. An asynchronous circuit delivers typical performance under typical conditions, which for a given logic function is twice the worst-case performance. </title>
Reference: 4. <author> Clock skew. </author> <title> As clocks get faster, chips get bigger and tracks get thinner, it is increasingly hard to keep clock skew within tolerable limits. The engineering effort and silicon resource which goes into the clock distribution network on todays high-end processors illustrate the scale of the problem. Asynchronous circuits have no clock and therefore do not suffer from clock skew. </title>
Reference: 5. <author> Concurrency. </author> <title> Most abstract representations of concurrent systems map far more naturally onto asynchronous circuits than they do onto clocked circuits. </title>
