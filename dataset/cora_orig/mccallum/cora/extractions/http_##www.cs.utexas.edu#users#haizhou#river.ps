Abstract: With the increasing density of VLSI circuits, the interconnection wires are getting packed even closer. This has increased the effect of interaction between these wires on circuit performance and hence, the importance of controlling crosstalk. In this paper, we consider river routing with crosstalk constraints. Given the positions of the pins in a single-layer routing channel and the maximum tolerable crosstalk between each pair of nets, we give a polynomial time algorithm to decide whether there is a feasible river routing solution and produce one with minimum crosstalk whenever the problem is feasible.

Reference-contexts: The program constructs the flow network and outputs it to a file in DIMACS format. This file is then input to a maximum flow program (here we use gold hlf <ref> [1] </ref>) to get a maximum flow. We run the program on 10 problems P 1 ; P 2 ; : : : ; P 10 .

Reference-contexts: All these factors increase the coupling effect (inductive and capacitive) between wiring resources. Increased coupling effect not only increases signal delays, but also decreases signal integrity due to transmission line behavior. This phenomenon is called crosstalk <ref> [2] </ref>. In the literature, previous works on the crosstalk problem in detailed routing fall into two main categories. In the first category, the gridless routing model is used and spacings between wires are adjusted to reduce crosstalk [3, 8].

The general approach used in all previous works consists of two steps.

Although river routing has the best developed theory among all detailed routing problems [9], there is no previous work which considered it together with crosstalk. Contrary to works in <ref> [3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11] </ref>, we consider crosstalk among wires in a global way during the routing process and develop a novel routing algorithm.

Reference-contexts: So the numbers of nodes and edges in the flow network are O (n 2 ). Since the total amount of spaces is at most W L, simply using Ford-Fulkerson algorithm gives us O (n 2 W L) running time <ref> [4] </ref>. 4 Post-Processing Routing solutions given by the above algorithm are composed of MC routes, which may have many stairs. In fact, not all stairs in the solution are necessary. We have a post-processing procedure to reduce the number of bends.

Contrary to works in [3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11], we consider crosstalk among wires in a global way during the routing process and develop a novel routing algorithm. <p> We also assume all routes to be monotonic, that is, starting from one pin, a route can only go under at most two directions. All previous works on river routing used this assumption, since it does not hurt the routabil-ity <ref> [9] </ref>, and at the same time, also assure each route to be the shortest one. A routing solution is a set of routes, one for each net, such that no route shares a grid point. A route in a routing solution is called a legal route. <p> Therefore, the two shaded regions must be considered equivalent. We can define equivalent spaces as follows. Here a falling net means its top pin is at the left of its bottom pin, and a rising net means its top pin is at the right of its bottom pin <ref> [9] </ref>. Definition 6 (equivalent spaces) Given net i and j with i &lt; j, move MC regions of nets j j i units down and left if it is a falling net, or j i units up and left if it is a rising net.

Reference-contexts: The post-processing procedure changes routes net by net, consisting of two passes. The first pass is from net 1 to net n. For each net, the contours are first derived. Then a line-search algorithm <ref> [10] </ref> can be used to find the leftmost route with minimum bends within the contours. The second pass is similar, but processes from net n to net 1. Instead, rightmost minimum bend routes are found.
