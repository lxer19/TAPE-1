Abstract: A dynamic bandwidth allocation strategy to support variable bit rate (VBR) video traffic is proposed. This strategy predicts the bandwidth requirements for future frames using either adaptive or non-adaptive least mean square (LMS) error linear predictors. The adaptive technique does not require any prior knowledge of the statistics, nor assumes stationarity. Several reservation schemes and pro-active congestion approach are also presented. Analysis using six one-half hour video traces indicate that prediction errors for the bandwidth required for the next frame are almost white noise. By reserving bandwidth equal to the predicted value, only the prediction errors need to be buffered. Because the errors are almost white noise, small buffers size, high utilization, and small delay are achieved. Simulation results show that for the same expected cell loss, buffers size is reduced by more than a factor of 100 and network utilization is increased more that 250 % as compared to a fixed service rate.

Reference-contexts: Several studies on VBR video traffic indicate the existence of a slowly decaying auto-correlation structure [4, 5, 6, 16]. Providing efficient transport and Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for VBR video is nontrivial in packet-switched networks. For instance, correlated traffic dramatically increases the queue length statistics at a multiplexor <ref> [1, 11, 12, 13] </ref>. Supporting VBR video traffic at a deterministic fixed service, not close to the peak, usually results in large buffers, large delay, and large delay jitter. <p> Using fixed service rate, for highly correlated input traffic with a heavy tail, if not served at a rate close to the peak, causes large queues, large delays, and excessive cell loss <ref> [1, 13, 17] </ref>. In contrast, by reserving bandwidth at least equal to the predicted value, only the errors in the prediction needs to be buffered. Because the errors resemble white noise or at most short memory, small buffers, high utilization and small delays can be achieved. <p> Highly correlated input process with a heavy tail, if served at a fixed rate not close to the peak, causes large queues, large delays, and excessive cell loss <ref> [1, 13, 17] </ref>. Hence, by reserving bandwidth at least equal to the prediction, only the errors of the prediction need to be buffered. Since the errors resemble white noise or at most short memory, smaller buffers, less delays, and higher utilization are expected when compared to traditional fixed rate reservations. <p> Highly correlated input process with a heavy tail, if served at a fixed rate not close to the peak, causes large queues, large delays, and excessive cell loss <ref> [1, 13, 17] </ref>.

If the predicted value is less than the actual value, the difference is buffered.

Reference-contexts: Also, it's worth noting that the filter coefficients used for prediction emphasize the last value. This is especially true for the I frames. Thus, one may model the I frame subsequence as a non stationary autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) with a difference d equal to one <ref> [3] </ref>. 6 Pro-Active Congestion Control This section discusses how a prediction algorithm can be used to achieve high utilization and prevent congestion in the network. One possible approach is to use a framing strategy. Time is split into frames, each frame corresponds to a time interval T.

The LMS is an adaptive approach. It does not require any prior knowledge of the autocorrelation of the sequence. Therefore, it can be used as an on-line algorithm for forecasting bandwidth.

If 0 &lt; &lt; 2, then NLMS will converge in the mean <ref> [8] </ref>. Using large results in a faster convergence and quicker response to signal changes. However, after convergence, the prediction coefficients will have large fluctuations. On the other hand using small results in slower convergence and less fluctuation after convergence, i.e., there is a trade off.

Two scenarios were studied through the simulation: (1) fixed service rate and (2) dynamic service rate based on prediction.

For more details about the encoder parameters see <ref> [18] </ref>. Table 1 shows the video traces, their mean, and maximum frame sizes. The traces were used to test the forecast methods. Since I, P, and B frame types have different statistical characteristics, we separate them and forecast each frame type separately.
