Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of shortest path interval routing, a space-efficient strategy for routing in distributed networks. In this scheme, an ordering of the vertices is chosen so that the edges of the network can be labeled with one or more subintervals of the vertex ordering: the resulting routing tables must be deterministic and route along shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. We first show constructively that any interval graph can be labeled with one circular subinterval on each edge; this extends a known result for proper interval graphs. We also provide a partial characterization for networks that admit linear interval routing when edges are labeled with exactly one interval, in terms of the biconnected components of any such network. This is the first such characterization when the paths are required to be shortest paths under the distance metric. Finally, we show that the class of networks that can be labeled with k 1 subintervals per edge is closed under composition with a certain class of graphs. fl A preliminary version of this paper appeared in the Proccedings of the Third International Colloquium on Structural Information and Communication Complexity (SIROCCO '96). z Department of Computer Science and Engg., University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE 68588, USA. email: sunil@calypso.unl.edu, FAX (402) 472-7767.

Reference-contexts: For large networks, this is clearly not a feasible solution, as the size of the routing table grows with the size of the network. Strategies to reduce the amount of space required by these schemes have been investigated. In <ref> [1] </ref>, a hierarchy of routing tables that limit the amount of space required, while staying within a constant factor of the length of the shortest paths, is used, i.e. it is shown that routing table space can be reduced at the expense of increasing the distance traversed by a message. <p> This method has been used in the C104 Router Chip of the INMOS T9000 Transputer design [12]. In this method, each node is assigned a distinct label from the set f1; : : : ; ng. Links are bidirectional and are individually labeled with subintervals of the interval <ref> [1; n] </ref>. The assignment of intervals to links is deterministic and must be such that for any node v in the network, the subintervals associated with outgoing links from v are pairwise disjoint, and their union covers the interval [1; n]. <p> are bidirectional and are individually labeled with subintervals of the interval <ref> [1; n] </ref>. The assignment of intervals to links is deterministic and must be such that for any node v in the network, the subintervals associated with outgoing links from v are pairwise disjoint, and their union covers the interval [1; n]. As a result, the routing table at a vertex has exactly d entries, where d is the degree of the vertex; furthermore, routing using this scheme requires very simple router complexity. Suppose a message with destination u arrives at node v. <p> There are many possible variations on this basic type of scheme. For instance, 2 an interval labeling scheme which always ensures that messages are routed along shortest paths is called an optimal scheme. Generally, the interval <ref> [1; n] </ref> is considered to be ordered circularly; all labels are understood to wrap around. We denote such a scheme a circular interval labeling or simply, an interval labeling (circularity being the default). If the interval [1; n] is used without wraparound, such a labeling scheme is called a linear interval <p> Generally, the interval <ref> [1; n] </ref> is considered to be ordered circularly; all labels are understood to wrap around. We denote such a scheme a circular interval labeling or simply, an interval labeling (circularity being the default). If the interval [1; n] is used without wraparound, such a labeling scheme is called a linear interval labeling. If we require that any label on an outgoing edge from v cannot include the label for v, the scheme is called a strict interval labeling [7]. <p> It is convenient to use integer labels for the vertices, and accordingly, given a positive integer n 1, we shall be dealing with the discrete interval <ref> [1; n] </ref>, consisting of the standard linear order of the integers 1; 2; : : : ; n. A subinterval of this interval is a contiguous subcollection of integers in the range from 1 to n (inclusive). <p> To each directed edge, e = (u; v) 2 E (G), we assign an edge label, L G (e), which is a set containing k or fewer disjoint subintervals of the cyclic interval <ref> [1; n] </ref>. Finally, for every pair of distinct vertices u; v, the following conditions are satisfied: 1. There is a unique outgoing edge, e, from v such that L G (u) is contained in one of the sub-intervals that constitute L G (e), and 2. <p> The labeling is linear if and only if all the subintervals that appear on any edge label are subintervals of the linear interval, <ref> [1; n] </ref>. We say that G 2 k-IRS if there exists an optimal k interval labeling for G. In addition, G 2 k-SIRS if there exists a optimal, strict, k interval labeling for G. <p> Consider a directed edge, e = (u; x 2 ), where u 2 V (H 2 ) fx 2 g. Then, under the given labeling L, the edge e must be labeled with a linear interval containing both 1 14 and n (i.e. the interval <ref> [1; n] </ref>), because e must be the first edge on any shortest path from u to either of vertices a or b. <p> Proof: Suppose that neither G 1 nor G k contain one of the vertices a and b. Consider an edge e = (u; x 1 ), with u 2 V (G 1 ), in the biconnected component G 1 . It must be labeled by the interval <ref> [1; n] </ref> since vertices a and b are not in G 1 and are only reachable from u by shortest paths which first traverse the edge e. But this violates strictness at vertex u. <p> Suppose edge e = (u 1 ; u 2 ) 2 E (G 0 ) has an edge label containing the interval [p; q] (which is a subinterval of the underlying circular interval <ref> [1; n] </ref>). <p> Consider a vertex (u; v). Suppose the neighbors of the vertex v in G 1 have labels v 1 ; v 2 ; : : : ; v k . We know that taken together with v, these labels form a contiguous subinterval of the linearly ordered interval <ref> [1; m] </ref> under the strict linear labeling L 1 for G 1 .

Reference-contexts: Note that in all other respects, the graph is considered to be undirected. 4 We assume that the reader is familiar with common terminology such as induced subgraphs, connected components (of an undirected graph) and maximal cliques (for definitions, see Bollobas <ref> [4] </ref>). The principal goal of interval routing schemes is to assign an ordered labeling to the nodes and links in a network, such that any point to point message can be routed efficiently using the labeling.

Furthermore, the 3-fan graph, another non-proper interval graph, does not admit any 1 linear interval labeling, whether strict or non-strict. In general, it is interesting to ask whether every interval graph can be circularly labeled in a strict manner.

Reference-contexts: Interval graphs are the intersection graphs of a set of intervals on a linear ordering, e.g. the real line. For our purpose, the following equivalent characterization (see Theorem 8.1, page 172 in Golumbic <ref> [11] </ref>) is more convenient. Definition 2 (Interval Graphs) Let G = (V; E) be a graph. Then the following statements are equivalent: 1. G is an interval graph. 2. <p> The clique representation is sometimes called the consecutive-ones ordering of the maximal cliques of G (it corresponds to a presentation of the clique-vertex incidence matrix such that every column has exactly one block of consecutive ones; see <ref> [11] </ref>). An interval graph is proper if and only if it does not contain K 1;3 as an induced subgraph. The following result is known: Theorem 1 ([6]) Let G be a connected interval graph. Then G is in 1-SLIRS if it is a proper interval graph. <p> See <ref> [11] </ref> for a formal definition. If the graphs G 1 ; G 2 ; : : : ; G n are all the same graph then their composition graph can be referred to be by G 0 [G 1 ].
