Abstract: a) Show that (S; F ; ~ P ) is a probability space. b) We want to show that conditioning in effect allows us to focus on a natural probability space with the sample space restricted to the set B. Can you find a set of events ~ F of subsets of B such that ~ F F and (B; ~ F; P B ) is a probability space, where p B is the restriction of ~ P on ~ F , i.e.
