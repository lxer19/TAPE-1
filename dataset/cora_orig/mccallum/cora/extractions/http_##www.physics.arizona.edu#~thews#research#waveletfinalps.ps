Abstract: Wavelet-type methods are employed for the analysis of pion field configurations that have been obtained by dynamical simulations in idealized scenarios relevant to the formation of disoriented chiral condensates. It is illustrated how the measurement of the isospin domain structure depends on the ability to zoom in on limited parts of the phase space, due to the interplay between the pion correlation length and the effective source geometry. The need for advanced analysis methods is underscored by the fact that the extracted neutral-fraction distribution would differ significantly from the ideal form, even under perfect experimental conditions, and, moreover, by the circumstance that thermal sources with suitably adjusted temperatures can lead to distributions that may be practically indistinguishable from those arising from DCC-type non-equilibrium evolutions.

Reference-contexts: situations can be addressed, such as three-dimensional pion field configurations, and 2) we apply the various analyses to more realistic scenarios containing pion field configurations that have been generated by dynamical simulations of the conditions expected to occur in the course of actual collisions. 2 Scenarios The earlier wavelet analyses <ref> [6] </ref> have been performed for one-dimensional systems. In the present study we wish to address scenarios in which the underlying pion fields are fully three-dimensional and have been generated by non-equlibrium evolutions of the kind characteristic of the DCC phenomenon. <p> Such a procedure and its characterization in terms of the distribution histograms were first presented in Ref. <ref> [6] </ref>. (We note that here the equivalent L value has a maximum of 8 in the wavelet formalism, since one does not generally utilize the average value of the signal function as a separate step in the wavelet hierarchy, i.e. the data sets for j=j min = 1 contain 2 j <p> the Haar basis, restricted to equal scales j = (9 L)=3 in each dimension. 5 5 Results The rope events are essentially one-dimensional, though they have been obtained with a fully three-dimensional calculation, and so they can be readily subjected to the same wavelet analyses as were made in Ref. <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In the present study we wish to address scenarios in which the underlying pion fields are fully three-dimensional and have been generated by non-equlibrium evolutions of the kind characteristic of the DCC phenomenon. For this purpose, we employ the linear model at the semi-classical level, as described in Ref. <ref> [7] </ref>. The chiral degrees of freedom are then described by a real O (4) field, (r; t) = (; ), and subject to a quartic self-interaction, V = 4 ( 2 v 2 ) 2 H. <p> We shall consider fields that have been obtained with intermediate (D=2) and fast (D=3) cooling, in which cases significant non-equilibrium behavior occurs [8]. In addition to these non-equilibrium scenarios, we shall also consider samples of rope and cube configurations drawn from thermal equilibrium ensembles <ref> [7] </ref>. 2 3 Wavelet formalism From the spatial dependence of the pion charge fractions in the events generated, we wish to extract information about possible domains of DCC. These domains will obviously occur with various scales and be located at various positions in space. <p> It should be added that a more detailed analysis may help to resolve this ambiguity, because the correlation function resulting from non-equilibrium dynamics differs qualitatively from the thermal form. Whereas the latter exhibits a typical gaussian-like fall-off with distance (see figs. 10-11 of Ref. <ref> [7] </ref>), the former has an anomalous tail resulting from the amplified soft modes (see Fig. 2 of Ref. [23]). Consequently, in principle, a sufficiently detailed analysis would reveal whether the source is of thermal form. In practice, though, it might be difficult to acquire such detailed information.

Reference-contexts: Then P 1 (f ) would be equal to the ideal form 1=2 p f and the distributions for the coarser scales would be the corresponding multiple convolutions (see Ref. <ref> [23] </ref>). In particular, the width would be given by f = (2 3L =45) 1=2 . <p> i.e. the deviation from a well-peaked distribution around 1 3 , is generally larger for the sample that has has been most rapidly cooled, D=3, as is to be expected because those events have experienced the most pronounced growth of the soft modes and thus possess the longest correlation length <ref> [23] </ref>. The difference between the two cooling rates is evident already at the coarsest scale and it grows steadily more pronounced. <p> Indeed, when the correlation length is smaller that the width of the rope, several independent sources effectively contribute and the resulting distribution is a result of a multiple convo 6 lution of the idealized distribution corresponding to a fully isospin aligned source (see Ref. <ref> [23] </ref>). Since the correlation length is larger for the D=3 events, the pion field maintains its direction better across any given slice and the effective number of sources per slice is then smaller for for D=2. This fact is manifested in a significantly more anomalous form of P (f ). <p> This fact is manifested in a significantly more anomalous form of P (f ). In fact, making a comparison with Fig. 3 in Ref. <ref> [23] </ref>, it appears that the P (f ) extracted for D=3 corresponds roughly to that obtained analytically for two independent sources in the scenarios with a random overall multiplicity, whereas the distribution extracted for D=2 looks more like the one obtained for six sources. <p> These observations are quite compatible with the fact that the correlation lengths, as measured by the full width at half maximum of the pion correlation function, are approximately 2.8 fm and 1.6 fm, for D=3 and D=2, respectively (as extracted from Fig. 2 in Ref. <ref> [23] </ref>). One would then expect (2:8=1:6) 2 3 more sources per area for D=2, which indeed appears to be the case, as just noted (six versus two). <p> Whereas the latter exhibits a typical gaussian-like fall-off with distance (see figs. 10-11 of Ref. [7]), the former has an anomalous tail resulting from the amplified soft modes (see Fig. 2 of Ref. <ref> [23] </ref>). Consequently, in principle, a sufficiently detailed analysis would reveal whether the source is of thermal form. In practice, though, it might be difficult to acquire such detailed information.
