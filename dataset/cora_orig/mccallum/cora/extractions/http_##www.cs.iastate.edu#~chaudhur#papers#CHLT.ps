Abstract: We prove tight bounds on the time needed to solve k-set agreement. In this problem, each processor starts with an arbitrary input value taken from a fixed set, and halts after choosing an output value. In every execution, at most k distinct output values may be chosen, and every processor's output value must be some processor's input value. We analyze this problem in a synchronous, message-passing model where processors fail by crashing. We prove a lower bound of bf =kc + 1 rounds of communication for solutions to k-set agreement that tolerate f failures, and we exhibit a protocol proving the matching upper bound. This result shows that there is an inherent tradeoff between the running time, the degree of coordination required, and the number of faults tolerated, even in idealized models like the synchronous model. The proof of this result is interesting because it is the first to apply topological techniques to the synchronous model.

Reference-contexts: In the past few years, researchers have developed powerful new tools based on classical algebraic topology for analyzing tasks in asynchronous models (e.g., <ref> [AR96, BG93, GK96, HR94, HR95, HS93, HS94, SZ93] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Consensus is well-known to be the "hardest" problem, in the sense that all other decision problems can be reduced to it. Consensus arises in applications as diverse as on-board aircraft control [W + 78], database transaction commit <ref> [BHG87] </ref>, and concurrent object design [Her91]. Between these extremes, as we vary the value of k from n to 1, we gradually increase the degree of processor coordination required. We consider this family of problems in a synchronous, message-passing model with crash failures.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we give a precise characterization of the tradeoffs required by studying a family of basic coordination problems called k-set agreement. In k-set agreement <ref> [Cha91] </ref>, each processor starts with an arbitrary input value and halts after choosing an output value. These output values must satisfy two conditions: each output value must be some processor's input value, and the set of output values chosen must contain at most k distinct values. <p> For a fixed value of f , Figure 1 shows that 2-set agreement can be achieved in half the time needed to achieve consensus. In addition, the lower bound proof itself is interesting because of the geometric proof technique we use, combining ideas due to Chaudhuri <ref> [Cha91, Cha93] </ref>, Fischer and Lynch [FL82], Herlihy and Shavit [HS93], and Dwork, Moses, and Tuttle [DM90, MT88]. In the past few years, researchers have developed powerful new tools based on classical algebraic topology for analyzing tasks in asynchronous models (e.g., [AR96, BG93, GK96, HR94, HR95, HS93, HS94, SZ93]). <p> Thus, in the case illustrated above, there is no protocol for 2-set agreement halting in 1 round. We note that the basic structure of the Bermuda Triangle and the idea of coloring the vertices with decision values and applying Sperner's Lemma have appeared in previous work by Chaudhuri <ref> [Cha91, Cha93] </ref>. In that work, she also proved a lower bound of bf =kc + 1 rounds for k-set agreement, but for a very restricted class of protocols. <p> when proving the lower bound in this paper: Lemma 1: If there is an n-processor protocol solving k-set agreement with f failures in r rounds, then there is an n-processor full-information protocol solving k-set agreement with f failures in r rounds. 4 The k-set Agreement Problem The k-set agreement problem <ref> [Cha91] </ref> is defined as follows. We assume that each processor p i has two private registers in its local state, a read-only input register and a write-only output register. <p> Theorem 24: The protocol P solves k-set agreement in bf =kc + 1 rounds. Acknowledgments The results in the paper have appeared earlier in preliminary form. The lower bound result has appeared in [CHLT93] and the algorithm has appeared in <ref> [Cha91] </ref>.

We note that the basic structure of the Bermuda Triangle and the idea of coloring the vertices with decision values and applying Sperner's Lemma have appeared in previous work by Chaudhuri <ref> [Cha91, Cha93] </ref>. In that work, she also proved a lower bound of bf =kc + 1 rounds for k-set agreement, but for a very restricted class of protocols. <p> The k + 1 points visited by this walk define the vertices of a simplex, and the triangulation B consists of all simplexes determined by such walks. For example, the 2-dimensional Bermuda Triangle is illustrated in Figure 5. This triangulation, known as Kuhn's triangulation, is defined formally as follows <ref> [Cha93] </ref>. Let e 1 ; : : : ; e k be the unit vectors; that is, e i is the vector (0; : : : ; 1; : : : ; 0) with a single 1 in the ith coordinate.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, the set of output values chosen has size at most k, as we are done. Theorem 24: The protocol P solves k-set agreement in bf =kc + 1 rounds.

Reference-contexts: In the past few years, researchers have developed powerful new tools based on classical algebraic topology for analyzing tasks in asynchronous models (e.g., <ref> [AR96, BG93, GK96, HR94, HR95, HS93, HS94, SZ93] </ref>). The principal innovation of these papers is to model computations as simplicial complexes (rather than graphs) and to derive connections between computations and the topological properties of their complexes.

Reference-contexts: Colorings with this property are called Sperner colorings, and have 9 been studied extensively in the field of algebraic topology. At this point, we exploit a remarkable combinatorial result first proved in 1928: Sperner's Lemma <ref> [Spa66, p.151] </ref> states that any Sperner coloring of any triangulated k-dimensional simplex must include at least one simplex whose corners are colored with all k + 1 colors.

Reference-contexts: Consensus is well-known to be the "hardest" problem, in the sense that all other decision problems can be reduced to it. Consensus arises in applications as diverse as on-board aircraft control <ref> [W + 78] </ref>, database transaction commit [BHG87], and concurrent object design [Her91]. Between these extremes, as we vary the value of k from n to 1, we gradually increase the degree of processor coordination required. We consider this family of problems in a synchronous, message-passing model with crash failures.
