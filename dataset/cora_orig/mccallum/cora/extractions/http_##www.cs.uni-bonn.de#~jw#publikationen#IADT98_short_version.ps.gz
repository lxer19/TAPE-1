Abstract: On the one hand, users should be able to specify their interests in a simple and comfortable way. Building on experiences gained by the information retrieval community we propose sets of weighted terms and best-match retrieval for this purpose. On the other hand, many on-line library catalogues exclusively provide a Boolean interface (exact-match retrieval). We therefore have to tackle the problem of mapping a set of weighted terms on an appropriate collection of Boolean queries, while at the same time restrictions of local warehouse resources and the generated net load have to be taken into account. In this paper the mapping problem and optimal solutions are defined in exact terms. We then develop two heuristic algorithms for the weighted and unweighted case and discuss some important implementation aspects.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION The design and analysis of query languages is at the heart of database research. Expressiveness of database query languages and the relationships between expressiveness and computational complexity are intensively studied by database theorists <ref> (Abiteboul et al., 1995) </ref>, where mostly the logical data model is assumed. On the application side SQL has been established as a standard for relational databases. In recent years the maintenance of different kinds of objects has increasingly become the focus of the database community.

Conf. on Management of Data, </booktitle> <pages> pages 207-216. </pages>
Reference-contexts: We expect that information needs can be rather large such that only few terms will actually co-occur in data records and the bottom-up computation of hit counts significantly prunes the power set lattice. 6 Let us mention that this idea has also been used in the mining of association rules <ref> (Agrawal et al., 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: resource restriction N , how many documents should be transferred from each R i in order to maximize the total number of relevant documents received? Blair describes an approach where a set of weighted query terms entered by the user is automatically converted into a set of conjunctive Boolean queries <ref> (Blair, 1984) </ref>. The use of weights is to reflect how successful the user believes them to be in the search as index terms, which is significantly different from our use of weights.

Reference-contexts: In general bibliographic data repositories support only exact-match queries. If all the repositories supported the same best-match query evaluation, the term set would be submitted as one single query to each of them and their results be merged <ref> (Callan et al., 1995) </ref>. However, this is the exception. What concerns traditional libraries we have to cope with exact-match query processing. 2. The resources, i.e., the storage capacity N of the local warehouse and the acceptable transmission costs are limited.

Reference-contexts: Information needs are typically characterized by some general as well as more specific terms. The weights express the relative importance of the different terms. This design decision was chosen in contrast to a complex query language to avoid the following drawbacks, but see <ref> (Chang et al., 1996) </ref> for a different approach: * Learning just another query formalism to express the complex specifications. * Uncertainty in formulating the vague information need, particularly at the beginning of the work. <p> It then remains to be tested, whether all the other subsets of the new set are in C. 7 RELATED WORK In <ref> (Chang et al., 1996) </ref> a translation problem is studied which is in some way similar to ours. While we are discussing the gap between information needs as term sets and Boolean queries, the cited papers concentrate on exact-match queries in "rich" Boolean languages.

Reference-contexts: FastLoad instead reduces the number of queries to n and tries to construct a query set whose storage costs are uniformly distributed among the terms of I. A system which aims at integrating distributed Internet resources and uses word-frequency information is GlOSS <ref> (Gravano et al., 1993) </ref>. It focuses on the identification of relevant text databases for a given query and uses the word-frequencies to estimate the result sizes of the query. An estimation of this kind based on some probability distributions can also be used in our framework.

Reference-contexts: By submitting only n hit counts for the singleton queries in -(I) the remaining 2 n n 1 hit counts can be saved. The hard problem of modeling a user's information need is not tackled in GlOSS. The Harvest system <ref> (Hardy et al., 1996) </ref> is an integrated set of customizable tools for gathering information from diverse Internet repositories and their subsequent effective use. The architecture enables the con struction of topic-specific content indexes, but the def-inition of a personalized view is not supported directly.

Reference-contexts: When queries are expressed by a sequence of keywords, the order can in the most simple case be given by the number of keywords which occur in a document (known as coordination level match). A survey of more sophisticated ranking schemes can be found in <ref> (Harman, 1992) </ref>. While in MyView the user's information need is described by a set of keywords and phrases which clearly calls for best-match retrieval, traditional libraries usually support only exact-match queries.

Reference-contexts: Subset checking, set union and intersection can then be reduced to bitwise operations. A collection of queries like Q is represented by the trie of bit vectors rep (T) for all T 2 Q. Remember that a trie is a digital search tree <ref> (Sedgewick, 1989) </ref> where at every inner node branching is determined by the single bits of the vectors: At the first level we branch to the left, if b 1 = 0 (FALSE), and to the right, if b 1 = 1 (TRUE); at the second level we branch according to b

The interested reader can find more information about MyView in <ref> (Wolff and Kalinski, 1997) </ref>. 2.2 TERM SETS VS. QUERIES The personalized collection of bibliographic data records provided by MyView is the result of the individual user's specification. Thus the description of the information need is of essential significance. <p> The resources can be computed in an exact way, but this accuracy has to be paid with a loss of efficiency <ref> (Wolff and Kalinski, 1997) </ref>. Proposition 5 Let Q be a query set determined by algorithm BestLoadUnweighted. Then Q satisfies condi tions (1) and (2) of Goal 1. 4 WEIGHTED INFORMATION NEEDS 4.1 BASIC CONCEPTS We now return to the general case, where information needs are expressed by weighted terms. <p> Note that rep (T 0 ) = rep (T 1 ) _ rep (T 2 ). It can be shown that the collection of all such pairs T 1 and T 2 can be generated by means of trie operations <ref> (Wolff and Kalinski, 1997) </ref>. It then remains to be tested, whether all the other subsets of the new set are in C. 7 RELATED WORK In (Chang et al., 1996) a translation problem is studied which is in some way similar to ours. <p> We do not expect that the user estimates the suitability of a term for searching, but that he describes the relevance of the terms among one another. In <ref> (Wolff and Kalinski, 1997) </ref> we discuss a different algorithm (FastLoad ) for the unweighted approach.
