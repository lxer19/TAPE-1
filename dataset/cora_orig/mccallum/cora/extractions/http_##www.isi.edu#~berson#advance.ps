Title: An Architecture for Advance Reservations in the Internet  
Author: Steven Berson Robert Lindell Robert Braden 
Date: July 16, 1998  
Affiliation: USC Information Sciences Institute  
Abstract: Much work has been done on establishing resource reservations over the Internet [3, 2, 8], but almost all of this work has consisted of establishing a reservation that begins immediately and has indefinite duration. An important issue is how to request an advance reservation, a reservation made now for resources that are to be reserved in the future. In this paper, we propose an architecture for Advance Reservation Servers (ARS), and describe their operation. By using ARS, no reservation state or scheduling state needs to be set up in the routers until the reservation is established. No multicast routing state (for multicast sessions) needs to be set up, either, until the reservation is established.

Reference-contexts: of multicast routing information in the destination domains makes it impossible for the advance reservation servers to reinject an RSVP message to be received by the destination hosts. 4 Related Work Proposals to add advance reservation support to the existing Internet Integrated Services Architecture were described in the RBONE presentation <ref> [4] </ref>. Early experiments with both Integrated Services and the emerging MBONE helped to realize the shortcoming of the current architecture 17 at that time. The issues raised by this early effort identity key problems, issues, and solutions and helped to shape the subsequent research in this area.

Reference-contexts: While these approaches provide a simple and straightforward extension to an existing immediate reservation system, it ignores the concerns of greatly inflating the amount of state that must be managed by routers. The work of Schelen and Pink, et al <ref> [6, 7, 14, 15] </ref> relates most closely to the work presented in this paper. They propose a server based approach that is domain based. For multicast reservations, servers communicate with other domains assuming that multicast routing has been installed in routers.

Reference-contexts: Instead, we assume the existence of an inter-domain multicast routing protocol, such as BGMP, which provides use with information to construct the distribution trees. We also address issues that arise with signaling over asymmetric routes between two domains. The work of the Tenet project <ref> [9] </ref> demonstrated that effective utilization of the network can be achieved using a movable partitioning between advance reservation and immediate reservation resources.
