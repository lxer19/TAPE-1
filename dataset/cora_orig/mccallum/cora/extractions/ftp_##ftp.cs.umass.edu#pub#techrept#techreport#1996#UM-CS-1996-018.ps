Abstract: In this paper, I show that methods from computational algebraic geometry can be used to carry out symbolic model checking using an encoding of Boolean sets as the common zeros of sets of polynomials. This approach could serve as a useful supplement to symbolic model checking methods based on Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams and may provide important theoretical insights by bringing the powerful mathematical machinery of algebraic geometry to bear on the model checking problem.

Reference-contexts: If G 1 = R 1 " G y 0 , then the variety defined by hG 1 i I corresponds to the points satisfying the formula _ EXy. In this fashion, we can find the least fixed point of y: _ EXy. I used the program Macaulay <ref> [2] </ref> to carry out these calculations. Macaulay provides facilities for defining rings, ideals, and homomorphisms, and for carrying out a variety of Grobner basis calculations. Many of these calculations could have been done using other computer algebra systems; Macaulay seemed to be the most convenient for these experiments.

Reference-contexts: Note, however, that each of these orders is defined only up to a permutation of the variables; there are really n! versions of the lexicographic and graded reverse lexicographic orders. There are results indicating that, for many applications, the graded reverse lexicographic order is most efficient <ref> [3] </ref>. 5 As we will see soon, some special orders, perhaps constructed from the graded reverse lexicographic, are also required for certain operations on ideals that are used in symbolic model checking. We need some additional notation.

Reference-contexts: In the general case, all of these measures behave fairly badly. For instance, examples are known where the construction of a Grobner basis for an ideal generated by polynomials of degree less than or equal to d can involve polynomials of degree 2 2 d <ref> [11] </ref>. Over the field of two elements, however, all the coefficients are 0 or 1, and when our ideal includes all the x 2 i + x i , the only polynomials we have to consider are those in which 7 no variable appears with degree greater than 1.
