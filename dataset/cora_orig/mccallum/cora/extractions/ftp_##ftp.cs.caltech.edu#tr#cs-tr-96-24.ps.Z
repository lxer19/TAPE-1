Title: Portable Graphical Tools for Concurrent Plasma Simulation October 18, 1996  
Author: Bradley D. Nelson Faculty Sponsor: Dr. Stephen Taylor 
Abstract: Low pressure reactors (less than 1.5 Torr) are used for etching processes in the microelectronics industry. Hawk, a 3-D concurrent DSMC simulation tool, is used for large-scale simulations of these reactors. In order for Hawk to be convenient for the process engineers who use such tools, XHawk, a graphical interface to Hawk, and XFalcon, the graphical interface to a chemical database used by Hawk, were created. These applications were developed for the X-Windows platform [Nelson95]. In order to make this tool useful to a broader segment of users, and to maintain support for new simulation techniques incorporated into Hawk, a new version of XHawk/XFalcon has been developed using Tcl/Tk. This multi-platform, portable, interface development language has reduced the code size of XHawk/XFalcon, making the applications more manageable and expandable, and at the same time has allowed the incorporation of many new interface features. The XFalcon chemical database system has been expanded to incorporate an improved description of chemical reactions. These interface tools are being used in the microelectronics industry for the design and evaluation of plasma reactors.

The DSMC method simulates individual particles as they move through a computational grid, colliding with walls and other particles.

Reference-contexts: Thus, Hawk takes advantage of parallel processor machines by mapping regions of the computational grid to each processing element. Hawk has been designed to be portable to a wide variety parallel processing platform. It is based on the Scalable Concurrent Programming (SCP) Library <ref> [Taylor96] </ref>, which uses an abstraction that allows Hawk to run on both message passing machines such as the Intel Paragon and shared memory machines such as the SGI Power Challenge. <p> It actually supports two forms of automatically generated reading and writing to files. One is a human readable text format that shows the value of each field and its type name and nested structure. The other is a packed binary format implemented in SCPlib <ref> [Taylor96] </ref>, which provides a compact structure that is still portable, but not human readable. A complete refrence of the field systems functions is provided in Appendix A. This system of fields has been interfaced to Tcl.
