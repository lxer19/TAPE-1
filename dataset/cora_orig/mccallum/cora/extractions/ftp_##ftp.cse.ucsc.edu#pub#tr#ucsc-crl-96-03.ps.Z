Abstract: In this paper, we for the first time present experimental evidence that the die surface can act as an RC interconnect, becoming an important factor in determining the voltage of a floating wire created by a CMOS open. We present a circuit model for this effect verified with HSPICE simulations. A detailed analysis of potential mechanisms behind this phenomenon is provided. We also present our measurement results for the trapped charge deposited on floating gates during fabrication.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, air increases the conductivity of the speculated hygroscopic film by a factor of 1000 or more. 4.4 Adsorption by the Die Surface? More than 40 years ago, Brattain and Bardeen <ref> [1] </ref> discovered that gas adsorption onto a semiconductor surface changes the conductance of that surface. This is the operating principle for many semiconducting gas and humidity detectors today [11].

Reference-contexts: The following day, the Vdd-ring effect has completely disappeared. This was an evidence that air entering the die cavity has something to do with this phenomenon. We learned from MOSIS <ref> [3] </ref> that in the case of hermetic sealing the packages are placed in a closed oven, where the chips are cleared of moisture at a temperature of 150 ffi C by passing dry nitrogen through the oven.

Reference-contexts: This charge is important, because it is one of the factors that determine the voltage on a floating gate [10] [2] [7] [4] [12], thus determining the behavior of the faulty cell this floating-gate transistor is in. Johnson <ref> [5] </ref> designed and performed trapped charge measurements on test structures that consist of floating-gate p-channel and n-channel transistors with varying lengths of poly extensions. These measurements showed that there was always a positive charge on the floating poly, and the voltage created by this charge ranged from 0.1V to 2.3V. <p> In this state, the measured gate voltage on the reference transistor will be the same as the gate voltage on the floating-gate transistor. This method is also used by Johnson <ref> [5] </ref>, but our measurement technique shown in Figure 2.1 keeps the drain-source voltage fixed at 0.2V, thus eliminating the hot electron effect that might otherwise alter the amount of the trapped charge, as we explain in Section A.2. <p> These metal wires are not surrounded by any other wire, that is, we can control the floating-gate voltage only by controlling the source-drain voltage. This is also the technique used by Johnson <ref> [5] </ref>. Figure 2.2 shows our measurement circuitry for this technique. A similar circuit is also used by Pricket et al. [8]. <p> So, as the floating wire gets closer to the die surface, it becomes more influenced by the voltage change on the Vdd-ring, which supports our die surface conduction speculation. It does not surprise us that Johnson <ref> [5] </ref> has not reported any such phenomenon, because all of the poly extensions in his F G transistors were covered by metal lines connected to transistor drains or sources, which shielded the poly extensions from the die surface. <p> One main conclusion from our measurements is that floating gate transistors with no or some poly extensions have negative trapped charge voltages sitting on their gates, up to almost -4V. This is in contrast with Johnson's measurements <ref> [5] </ref>, who measured always positive charge on his floating gate transistors, which also had some or no poly extensions. This clearly shows the fabrication process dependence of the trapped charge polarity. <p> The extrapolation error with C fw = 34fF corresponding to transistor 7 with the largest C fw among transistors 7-12 was -0.07V. Therefore, we expect the extrapolation error for transistors 8-11 to be between -0.5V and -0.07V. Even though Johnson <ref> [5] </ref> has not reported his extrapolation errors, we expect his to be similar as ours. <p> and keeping the drain-source voltage fixed at 0.2V as shown in Figure 2.1 ensures that the F G transistor will be in the linear region while taking measurements, whereas controlling the F G voltage with the source or drain terminal of the F G transistor, as also done by Johnson <ref> [5] </ref>, allows the transistor to be only in the saturation region while taking measurements, unless there is a large enough V tc on the gate.

Reference-contexts: In a standard cell design, most of the area is taken by the metal interconnect. Therefore, the likelihood of a break in the interconnect is greater than the one inside a cell. Moreover, not all breaks inside a cell create floating-gate transistors. They may create, for instance, network breaks <ref> [6] </ref>. In addition to observing the effects of different metal layers and metal lengths on the amount of trapped charge, we also wanted to try erasing this charge via ultra-violet light as done for EPROMs.

Reference-contexts: In the HP 0.8 technology our chips were fabricated with, two passivation layers are used. First, a 0.35 silicon oxynitride film is deposited on top of the metal-3 layer, followed by a 0.60 silicon nitride film. Rabiller et al. <ref> [9] </ref> reported that the room temperature resistivity varies smoothly from less than 10 14 cm for silicon nitride to more than 10 16 cm for silicon dioxide by varying the ratios of oxygen and nitrogen in a silicon oxynitride film deposited using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). <p> Because metal-2 might be slightly closer to the die surface than it is to the substrate in this 3-metal process, and the dielectric constant is 7.0 for silicon nitride and between 3.9 and 7.0 for silicon oxynitride depending on its oxygen-nitrogen composition <ref> [9] </ref>, we assumed C fwsurf to be 30fF.
