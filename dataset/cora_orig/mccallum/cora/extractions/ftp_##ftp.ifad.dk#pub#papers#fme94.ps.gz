Abstract: System Component: first results in a Abstract. This paper presents initial results in a comparative study of formal and conventional techniques in the design of a secure system component: a trusted gateway. The operation of a trusted gateway is briefly introduced. The industrial context of its development is described, as is the form of the experiment. So far, part-formal and conventional design specifications have been produced for the trusted gateway from a common informal requirements document. As part of this process, queries have been raised against the informal requirements. These have been carefully logged, and form the subject of a preliminary analysis presented here. These first results suggest that the use of a formal specification language (in this case VDM-SL) leads to an an increased number of queries, and a bias in the specifier's comparative study

Reference-contexts: The syntax of the language was checked quickly by the tool and the correctness of the specification with respect to informal requirements was validated by executing the specification on simple test cases (cf. the notion of validation conjecture in <ref> [BFL + 94] </ref>) and using the Toolbox's facilities for test suite construction and coverage analysis. A tendency was noted towards the use of familiar constructions instead of the most appropriate or concise form.

Reference-contexts: Other functions which do not benefit are the initialisation where data is merely read from one source and stored in another for future use. Boswell's description of the formalization of a security policy model in Z <ref> [Bos93] </ref> shows similarities with our approach. In particular, we note the same "tension between abstraction and `completeness' " in determining how much of the customer requirement is to be written in formal notation.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction British Aerospace (Systems and Equipment) (BASE) produces a number of security-critical systems. The use of formal methods in the development of these systems is not mandatory, but to attain the higher evaluation levels <ref> [SEC91] </ref>, certain aspects of the design should be modelled formally. For example, there is a requirement at the E5 level of assurance for the security policy enforced by the product to be described formally. At E6, formal development with proofs is required.

Reference-contexts: Independence is enforced by ensuring that the teams work in physically separate areas and are instructed not to discuss the project with each other. One team uses the standard BASE development methodology, Ward and Mellor <ref> [WM85] </ref>, supported by the Teamwork Computer Aided System/Software Engineering tool set 4 . The other team follows a similar design methodology, but uses formal specification to describe at least the function enforcing the security policy implemented by the gateway.
