Reference-contexts: One possibility is to forward the entire execution trace to the originator, who checks it. This however is too costly. We would like to explore the use of holographic proof checking techniques <ref> [1] </ref>. This is quite a speculative idea. The current approaches are very theoretical. In principle they do help, but the cost in practice of existing solutions is prohibitive. We are considering investigating ways to use the ideas in a more practical way.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the basic support for agent execution, the Sanctuary project will develop the trust framework needed for inter-server communications. This necessarily implies having some basic public key infrastructure | we should be able to leverage off of the existing work being done to support SSL [5], PCT <ref> [2] </ref>, and TLS. 2 2 The Internet Engineering Task Force's Transport Level Security group is developing a merged protocol based on SSL version 3 and features from PCT.

Reference-contexts: In agent-based computing, most researchers have been concentrating on one side of the security issue: protecting the server from potentially malicious agents. Related work in downloadable executable content (Java, Software Fault Isolation [14], Proof-Carrying Code [12, 11], OS extension mechanisms such as packet filters [8], type safe languages <ref> [3, 6] </ref>, etc) all focus on this problem.

Reference-contexts: In Sanctuary, we envision that the trust decision will be made by the agent's software itself. Thus, trust specification is simply an object in Java, and any efficiently computable function may be used. This is similar in spirit with the work of Blaze and Feigenbaum <ref> [4] </ref>, except that by unifying the agent language and the trust specification language, the programmer's work is simplified. 5 Mobile Java Other approaches to providing mobility to Java programs [13] requires modifying the interpreter.

Reference-contexts: So there is no choice but to transmit y 0 in entirety. We will not save bandwidth. We will gain something: the verification process is faster. (The verifier receiving y 0 will perform some quick spot-checks). A better approach is to use computationally sound (CS) proofs as in <ref> [7, 9] </ref>. Having constructed the holographic proof y 0 as above, the server hashes it down via a tree hashing scheme using a collision-resistant hash function h. Only the root of the tree is sent to the originator. This is relatively short, so bandwidth is saved.

Reference-contexts: No agent state needs to be transferred at all. 3.3 Fault Tolerance Approaches In <ref> [10] </ref>, Schneider developed a general method for mobile agent computation security, marrying some ideas from the field of fault tolerance and cryptography. Unfortunately, its fault model is completely unrealistic: it assumes that replicated servers fail independently.
