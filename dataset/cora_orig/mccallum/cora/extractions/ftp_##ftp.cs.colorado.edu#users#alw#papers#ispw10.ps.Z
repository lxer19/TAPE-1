Abstract: A software system spends its life in two, very different worlds: development and operations. Traditional software process technology has focused on supporting the activities associated only with development. We believe that there are significant benefits to be gained by also supporting processes in the field. Furthermore, once support is in place for operation processes, we can begin to consider how to profitably integrate development and operations.

If we could apply the full power of existing pre-deployment (i.e., development) configuration management processes, we could provide the following capabilities. * Localizationthe ability to alter various parameters of the operational system.
