Abstract: Many practical dextrous manipulation tasks involve large-scale motion of the grasped object while maintaining a stable grasp. To plan such tasks, one must control both the motion of the object and the contact locations, while also adhering to the workspace constraints typical of multi-fingered hands. In this paper, we integrate the relevant theories of contact kinematics, nonholonomic motion planning, coordinated object manipulation, grasp stability and finger gaits to develop a general framework for dextrous manipulation planing. To illustrate our approach, the framework is applied to the problem of manipulating a sphere with three hemi-spherical fingertips. The simulation results are presented.

Reference-contexts: The simulation results showed that large-scale motion were achieved by incorporating rolling movements and finger gaiting. We are currently working on generalizing this work to dextrous manipulation of general objects and incorporate the finger chains into the problem setting. More issues like contact force optimization <ref> [3] </ref>, uncertainty and dynamic constraints will also be incorporated into the framework.

Reference-contexts: Several results related to the force closure grasps of a sphere and primitive planing algorithms are given in this section. Due grasp to the limited paper space, we will not give proofs here and interested readers please refer to our technical report <ref> [7] </ref>. The simulation results will be given in next section. Assume the radius of a sphere is r and the coefficient of friction between the sphere and fingers are = tan (). The we have following results on FC grasps of a sphere: 1. <p> Note the `longitude' and `equator' here are not restricted for one specific coordinate system of the sphere. Any two great circles that are perpendicular to each other can be made into a longitude and an equator, through some coordinate transformation <ref> [7] </ref>. If the initial grasp is only 3-finger FC but not 2-finger FC, the rolling path need to be used to adjust the contact points to get a 2-finger FC grasp.

The scenario is as the following: suppose fingers f 1 and f 2 form a grasp but reach their limits. <p> This essentially suggests that only one pair of FC regions on the object may be enough for using finger substitution to move the object for arbitrary amount. This observation is important since paper <ref> [8] </ref> proved the existence of opposite positions on smooth objects, which means there exists at least 1 pair of FC regions on all smooth objects.

Reference-contexts: However, it requires detailed computation to maintain the 3 fingers to form a FC grasp before the two reach antipodal positions. Borrow the concept <ref> [12] </ref> of task-oriented optimal grasp, the initial grasps which are or close to 2-finger FC grasp are preferred for dextrous manipulation tasks with three fingers. As for applying the finger gaitings for sphere manipulation, note that sphere is homogeneous with respect to rotation movements.

Reference-contexts: The authors proved the existence of some `good' grasps on smooth objects and repeatedly used finger gaiting to achieve those grasps. The change of a grasp from three fingers to two fingers, i.e. finger gaiting, was referred as a "hyperspace" jump by Montana <ref> [14] </ref>, since the number of degrees of freedom increased as contact is lost. Montana discussed a path of twirling a baton using coordinated object manipulation and finger gaiting, but didn't discuss how to automatically generate plans utilizing finger gaits. <p> The relevant theory of contact kinematics <ref> [13, 14] </ref>, nonholonomic motion planning [10, 15], grasp stability [16, 17],coordinated object manipulation [11] and finger gaiting [8] are naturally incorporated in this framework.

The contact model for three-finger grasp is hard-finger contact and the model for two-finger grasp is soft-finger contact <ref> [15] </ref>. To implement finger gaiting with three fingers, two fingers need to form a FC grasp. Then a necessary condition for using gaiting with three fingers is that at least one of the grasping fingers can form a force closure grasp with other two fingers of the hand.
