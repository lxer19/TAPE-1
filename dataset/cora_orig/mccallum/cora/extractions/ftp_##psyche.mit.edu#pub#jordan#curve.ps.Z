Abstract: Unconstrained point-to-point human arm movements are generally gently curved, a fact which has been used to assess the validity of models of trajectory formation. In this study we examined the relationship between curvature perception and movement curvature for planar sagittal and transverse arm movements. We found a significant correlation (p &lt; 0:0001, n = 16) between the curvature perceived as straight and the curvature of actual arm movements. We suggest that subjects try to make straight-line movements, but that actual movements are curved because visual perceptual distortion makes the movements appear to be straighter than they really are. We conclude that perceptual distortion of curvature contributes to the curvature seen in human point-to-point arm movements and that this must be taken into account in the assessment of models of trajectory formation.

Reference-contexts: Uno, Kawato and Suzuki (1989) suggested this possibility based on their minimum torque change model. This model is based on an optimal control formulation in which a `cost function' is chosen in order to evaluate the performance of the system under control <ref> (Bryson and Ho 1975) </ref>. The cost function is usually defined as the integral of an instantaneous cost over a certain time interval, and the aim of the planner is to minimize the value of this cost function.

Reference-contexts: Imperfections in such a controller could lead to curved trajectories. The third possibility is that the central nervous system, rather than directly computing torque, specifies the trajectory in terms of an intermediate representation, such as a series of equilibrium positions (Flash 1987) or desired muscle lengths <ref> (Bullock and Grossberg 1988) </ref>. The actual trajectory produced then depends on the dynamics of the arm. This possibility differs from imperfect control in that it is this intermediate representation, rather than the outcome, which is matched to the reference trajectory.

Reference-contexts: The movement times were averaged across subjects for each direction of movement. To assess curvature perception we calculated the amplitude of the sinusoid (P c ) at which the subjects perceived the cursor as moving in a straight path. The 2AFC data was analyzed using probit analysis <ref> (Dobson 1990) </ref>; a cumulative Gaussian function was fit to the forced choice data to calculate the mean. The 95% confidence limits of the mean were also estimated from the psychometric function.

Reference-contexts: The nature of this trajectory curvature in relation to the parameters of the movement has often been used to evaluate the predictive power of models of trajectory planning (e.g. Uno et al. 1989) and control <ref> (e.g. Flash 1987) </ref>.
