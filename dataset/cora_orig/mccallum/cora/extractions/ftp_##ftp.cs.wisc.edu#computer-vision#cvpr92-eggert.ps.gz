Abstract: Currently the aspect graph is computed from the theoretical standpoint of perfect resolution in the viewpoint, the projected image and the object shape. This means that the aspect graph may include details that an observer could never see in practice. Introducing the notion of scale into the aspect graph framework provides a mechanism for selecting a level of detail that is "large enough" to merit explicit representation. This effectively allows control over the number of nodes retained in the aspect graph. This paper introduces the concept of the scale space aspect graph, defines an interpretation of the scale dimension in terms of the spatial extent of features in the image and presents a detailed example for a simple class of objects.

Reference-contexts: Research in this area was popularized by Witkin's scale space analysis of the inflections of a 1-D signal [28].

In addition, a number of other researchers have described different "hierarchical" or "multi-resolution" representations, for example pyramids, that are similar to the scale space concept. To better explain the approach we review the basics of Witkin's 1-D signal analysis.

Reference-contexts: Implicit in this method is the fact that the size effects due to viewing distance will also be accounted for. These ideas are similar in nature to those used by researchers determining visibility constraints for automatic sensor placement <ref> [6] </ref>. First one must determine which features should be measured. In order to be measured a feature must have some spatial extent in the image. This means that a junction, which occurs at a single point, should not be one of the features we now concentrate on.

In their representation separate instances of the aspect graph are recorded for varying articulation parameter values of an object. Here scale can be thought of in a similar manner. The more implicit of the two forms corresponds most closely to the asp of Plantinga and Dyer [20]. <p> Alternatively, one can analyze the overall partition in viewpoint space as scale is varied and detect those values at which the structure of the subdivision is altered. This technique lends itself well to sampling methods used to locate these values, as has been done with articulated assemblies <ref> [23] </ref>. Finally, how does this method lead to a selection of the "most important" aspects. First, if a particular image resolution is chosen, a more accurate depiction of the viewpoint space parcellation is available. This in conjunction with techniques based on relative cell size could order the aspects.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The aspect graph is considered important because it provides a a complete view-centered representation of an object. Considerable research has been performed in recent years to generate algorithms that compute the aspect graph and its related representations <ref> [4, 7, 9, 14, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27] </ref>. However, the practical utility of the resulting aspect graphs has been questioned. <p> The domain of 2 objects has evolved from polygons [10], to polyhedra [9, 20, 25, 26, 27], to solids of revolution [7, 14], to piecewise-smooth objects <ref> [4, 21, 22, 24] </ref>, to articulated assemblies [23]. Almost without exception, a view of the object is represented using a qualitative description of the line drawing, such as the image structure graph (ISG) [16]. The actual labeling of contours and junctions varies slightly among researchers. <p> Distinctions between general and accidental views are usually based on isomorphism of the ISG. Lastly, two viewpoint space models are commonly used. The first is the 2-D viewing sphere, on which each point defines a viewing direction for orthographic projection <ref> [9, 14, 20, 21, 22, 24] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Also, the qualitative features of X at a given scale can be traced back across all lower scales ("causality"). Research in this area was popularized by Witkin's scale space analysis of the inflections of a 1-D signal <ref> [28] </ref>. Since that time the scale space concept has been applied to the curvature of 2-D curves [5, 17], the curvature of 3-D curves [18], the 2-D intensity map [1, 12, 15, 29] and 3-D object shape [13]. <p> In their representation the aspect graph was formed as the projection of certain higher-dimensional "volumes", representing particular feature configurations, into the viewpoint space. This is essentially the conversion process used between the two forms given here. Other representations such as extensions of the interval tree concept <ref> [15, 28] </ref> may exist depending on the interpretation of the scale parameter, which is the topic of the next section. 4.1 Interpretations of Scale in the Scale Space Aspect Graph We have proceeded this far without assigning any particular meaning to the scale dimension and without saying how the scale parameter

In addition, a number of other researchers have described different "hierarchical" or "multi-resolution" representations, for example pyramids, that are similar to the scale space concept. To better explain the approach we review the basics of Witkin's 1-D signal analysis.
