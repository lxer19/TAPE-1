Abstract: The question is: How to get the right information at the right time? A scientist analyzing terabytes of data is interested in tools and results developed by other scientists investigating the same or similar data. This information needs to be available to a scientist at the time of his investigation to gain maximum benefit, not before and not after. In this paper we describe a proposed system (Track ) for tracking tools developed and results obtained by scientists while analyzing databases. The system provides interoperability of tools and results of interest to scientists at time of investigation. We are addressing a period in the lifetime of information which is not yet fully established to be designed and categorized in a central database, where a support team is available for the task; nor is it too trivial, i.e. it would be a great loss if this information is not captured and shared with other scientists for the benefit of ongoing research. Track is for the scientist to use and benefit from as a collaborative medium.

Reference-contexts: Whether it be information lying on an individual's desktop hard disks, or published in a conference or journal, that is the problem. The problem becomes more evident in multidisciplinary projects, where semantical barriers for data among scientists is a problem, let alone tools and results <ref> [CIESIN 91] </ref>. Data sharing has an impact on all of us, but the sharing of information (i.e. tools and results) will have a greater impact on 1 the advancement of research and moves us into an information sharing era.

Reference-contexts: Each element in the set of data attributes forming a concept, might require a different conversion or transformation to satisfy a tool's input criteria. In other cases, the object or relation containing the attributes is the one that needs translation <ref> [Frank 88] </ref>. For example, an image in raw format might need to be converted into GIFF, though the attributes of interest are within the image (e.g. image intensity as in differential movement example in section 2).

Reference-contexts: It is becoming quite difficult to extract relevant information or independent results from the massive available literature. The inefficiency stems from the little or no support available for information developed by the individual scientist to be pooled back together into a system for the benefit of other scientists <ref> [French 90, Schatz 91] </ref>. This could cause delay and sometimes frustration in carrying out ongoing research. It is our goal to integrate data from databases, hook up analysis tools developed, and results from publications into a single system for scientists. <p> Data sharing has an impact on all of us, but the sharing of information (i.e. tools and results) will have a greater impact on 1 the advancement of research and moves us into an information sharing era. As <ref> [French 90] </ref> states: Failure to integrate the data management and analysis environments restricts the productivity of the scientist. Typically, extant systems are not integrated In this paper we propose a system geared towards capturing tools and results developed by scientists.

Reference-contexts: Track does not have a mechanism for data retrieval; it relies on using underlying databases (see figure 1). Databases can be of many kinds, federated database (FDBS), non-federated, distributed, : : : , etc. as noted in [Amit 90]. Having recent advancements in the heterogeneous database area <ref> [Hsiao 89, Sheth 90, Kim 91] </ref>, data extraction out of multidisciplinary databases is more feasible. However, non-federated databases still demand scientists to explore and find interesting data on their own.
