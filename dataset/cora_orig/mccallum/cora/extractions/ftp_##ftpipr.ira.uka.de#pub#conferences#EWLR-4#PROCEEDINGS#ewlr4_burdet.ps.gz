Abstract: In this paper, a method is presented for the fast learning of visually guided movements. The presented algorithms have been tested with a manipulator tracking manoeuvering targets. Three parameters critical for the visuo-motor coordination have been identified, and are learned in less than one hour of repeated movements. The conditions for fast and precise vision have been investigated analytically, and the results of this analysis have been used for improving the image processing during the motions. After learning, the robot performs smooth and fast reaching movements and can easily drop small objects into the waggon of a moving model train. Finally, the method is generalised to a methodology for the representation of artificial systems, which provides them the ability to adapt themselves to many different tasks. It is also explained how biological models can be used in this scheme.

Reference-contexts: The trajectory of the ma-noeuvering object is modelled by equations (2) and (3). The object's state is calculated using a Kalman-filter, which guarantees the best estimation in the least square sense <ref> (A. E. Bryson, 1975) </ref>. Because a delay occurs, due to image processing and the corresponding motor reaction time, the filter gives an estimate of the past object state. The actual object position is predicted using this estimate and equation (2) with V k 0. (simulation).

Reference-contexts: Generally, the objects are reached only in a limited area, and the parameters are tuned by the programmer (Allen, 1992; But-tazo, 1994). We require, in contrast, a robot which optimises its parameters autonomously and is able to reach objects in its whole workspace. In (Wen, 1995) and <ref> (Aboaf, 1988) </ref>, algorithms for improving the hitting of a ball have been proposed. The learning was performed off-line using a free body model of the ball trajectory. Tracking a manoeu-vering object is a more difficult task.

Reference-contexts: Recent work has brought evidence that the motion is planned in extrinsic cartesian coordinates (Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi, 1993), that the visual control is performed at discrete times (Milner, 1992) and the spinal control and muscle elasticity roughly corresponds to feedback control <ref> (McIntyre, 1990) </ref>. The control scheme of figure 1 is therefore a coarse model for the control of the human arm, and our implementation proved that this model works. Our artificial robot system, learning visually guided movements, can be compared with the young child learning reaching motions (van Hofsten, 1990).

Reference-contexts: To improve the reaching strategy, some properties of human motions have been transposed in the robot motion behav-iour. In human arm motions with high accuracy, it has been observed that the velocity is adapted to the required accuracy and synchronised with the vision <ref> (Milner, 1992) </ref>. It was further shown that this is probably achieved by optimising the movements with respect to smoothness and fastness (Hoff, 1992; Burdet, 1996). <p> From a control theoretic standpoint, the control of our robot and of the human arm are similar.

Reference-contexts: Planing using techniques of the optimal control theory has been investigated, but led to solve nearly Gauss-distributed around the expected positions. a sixth order polynomial, which is not possible for real time application using simple hardware <ref> (Mueller, 1995) </ref>. A new flexible motion planer has been built which plans smooth motions and is able to handle sensor signals or user inputs at any time (Luthiger, 1996). With this planner, it is for example possible to reset the destination during the movement. <p> Using this special window, the frequency of analysed images decreased to 80 ms, which is the minimal time possible with our frame grabber <ref> (Mueller, 1995) </ref>. 4 LEARNING THE VISUO MOTOR COORDINATION Learning efficient reaching movements is a complex task, which probably could not be performed in one step. We therefore subdivided this task into four subtasks which are simpler to learn. <p> To reach the same precision as our method, a feedfor-ward neural network or a Kohonen neural network required more than two times more operations to perform the hand-eye transformation <ref> (Mueller, 1995) </ref>. 4.2 Human-like Velocity Scaling To control the timing of robot movements, the timing of human arm movements has been transposed. <p> The movement is performed 10 times and the mean synchronicity measure is used to determine the optimal RT. It is necessary to use mean values, because the reaching includes many different processes whose timing are only partially reproductable <ref> (Mueller, 1995) </ref>. The RT depends on the kinematics of the robot motions and therefore it is necessary to find the optimal RT for each velocity scaling factor . The result of the optimisation is shown in figure 5. <p> The result of the optimisation is shown in figure 5. This function is stored in a table and used to perform further movements. the velocity scaling factor . It was experimentally confirmed that the learned RT does not depend on the velocity of the moving object <ref> (Mueller, 1995) </ref>. It must also be checked that the reaching is improved by the optimisation. In this aim, the grasping time T grasp was measured as a function of the RT, for different . <p> The task we implemented consists of grasping a long object. Long objects must be grasped widthwise, thus this task requires the knowledge of the object's centre of mass and orientation. A fast algorithm for determining the orientation of long objects requiring only 1 multiplication/pixel and 4 additions/pixel was designed <ref> (Mueller, 1995) </ref>. The position was determined as before. The object may be grasped only after the position and orientation have been accurately determined, i.e after about 1 s.
