Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Large scale (&gt;100 ton), low background (&lt;1 event/day/ton) underground particle detectors have acquired importance in the study of rare events, such as those associated with solar and atmospheric neutrino detection and stellar collapse [1-6], or the search for exotic phenomena such as dark matter [7,8], proton decay <ref> [9] </ref>, and magnetic monopoles [10]. The sensitivity of these experiments is ultimately limited by the detector volume (which sets the signal rate) and the detector background. Although the magnitude and nature of this background varies among experiments, depending on the event signature, there are generally three main contributions: 1.

Reference-contexts: Detection of low energy signals relies on both reducing radioactive impurities and/or identifying the signature of specific impurities and subtracting it from the background. Almost without exception the detectors now in operation or under construction are either modular tracking arrays with scintillation counters (e.g.MACRO <ref> [11] </ref>) or water Cherenkov detectors (e.g. Kamioka [12] and SNO [13]). These detectors are limited to energies above the thallium barrier. Cherenkov detectors do not produce sufficient light below a few MeV energy, and modular scintillators contain too many radioactive contaminants.

Reference-contexts: Kamioka [12] and SNO [13]). These detectors are limited to energies above the thallium barrier. Cherenkov detectors do not produce sufficient light below a few MeV energy, and modular scintillators contain too many radioactive contaminants. The only large, unsegmented underground scintillation detector described in the literature (Artemovsk <ref> [14] </ref>), also has too high a radioactive background to be useful at low energies. This paper describes a moderately sized unsegmented liquid scintillation detector - the Counting Test Facility (CTF)- in the Underground Laboratory at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso.

Reference-contexts: The scintillator is viewed by 100 photomultipliers immersed in 1000 tons of purified water. The primary objective of the CTF was to determine the feasibility of a low background liquid scintillation detector for signals with energies extending down to 250 keV, specifically for the Borexino Solar Neutrino Experiment <ref> [15] </ref>. The CTF detector was operated down to 25 keV to measure the 14 C b-spectrum with an endpoint of 156 keV. Borexino, which is now under construction, will detect the low energy neutrinos from the decay of 7 Be in the sun by neutrino-electron scattering.

Preliminary laboratory tests of the optical properties and radiopurity of scintillator components and mixtures were studies after a variety of purification processes <ref> [17] </ref>. These studies indicated that the scintillator solvent, pseudocumene, was radiopure of U, Th and K at the level &lt; 10 -4 Bq/kg; the fluor, PPO, was also radiopure of U and Th at the level &lt; 10 -4 Bq/kg. <p> The plant capacity was 50 L/h in the water extraction mode and 20 L/h in the distillation mode. Details of the construction and operation of the purification plant are reported elsewhere <ref> [17] </ref>. 3.5 Water Tank and Clean Room The tank containing the shielding water is constructed of 8 mm thick carbon steel, coated with Permatex on the interior. It stands 10 m high and is 11 m in diameter.

Reference-contexts: Samples of the shielding water are removed and tested for radon. A preconcentration method followed by counting in a miniaturized low background gas counter achieved sensitivities of 1 mBq/m 3 [31]. Water samples were also tested for U and Th by inductively coupled mass spectroscopy <ref> [18] </ref>, and neutron activation [38] with a sensitivity of 2 x 10 -16 g U,Th/g-water. Samples of scintillator are routinely checked for their optical attenuation length and fluorescence by spectrometers [20]. Measurements of U,Th and K in the scintillator were also obtained by high sensitivity neutron activation analysis [38].

Reference-contexts: The yield for 7.7 MeV aparticles from 214 Po decay is approximately 1000 photons/MeV. Scintillation from a-excitation was distinguished from bexcitation from the long time fluorescence tail [21,22,34,35]. Detailed studies of the absorption and fluorescence spectra of potential scintillator mixtures were carried out in the laboratory <ref> [20] </ref>. The maximum in the fluorescence spectrum of the chosen scintillator was at 365 nm, as measured in a conventional fluorescence spectrometer. The optical processes involved in the emission and propagation of scintillation light in a large detector are complex. <p> Water samples were also tested for U and Th by inductively coupled mass spectroscopy [18], and neutron activation [38] with a sensitivity of 2 x 10 -16 g U,Th/g-water.

Measurements of U,Th and K in the scintillator were also obtained by high sensitivity neutron activation analysis [38]. A muon telescope was installed on the top of the water tank to obtain unambiguous data on the CTF-response to muons.

An overview of the CTF and its conceptual design is provided in section 2. Section 3 provides a summary of the major components of the CTF detector. <p> The energy resolution of the 214 Po a was 70 keV (1s) with 100 phototubes. The energy resolution deteriorated with loss of phototubes, with the resolution scaling approximately as n -1/2 being the number of phototubes). Details of the energy calibration are reported elsewhere <ref> [32] </ref>. The location of events in the CTF are reconstructed based on photon arrival times at the phototubes after the trigger. <p> The probability density function of the photoelectron arrival times for the reconstruction is determined by mapping out events with known positions using a radon spiked scintillator source within the detector [39]. Details of event reconstruction are reported in detail elsewhere <ref> [32] </ref>. The spatial resolution of event 15 reconstruction of the CTF detector is approximately 15 cm at 300 keV decreasing to 10 cm at 1 MeV, based on 100 phototubes. <p> With 100 phototubes &gt;90% of the 7.7 MeV 214 Po (a) were identified with less than 5% b-events misidentified as an a-event (the efficiency of a/b discrimination is improved significantly when the discriminator is optimized for spatial position of the event <ref> [32] </ref>). As the number of phototubes decreased the a/b discrimination deteriorated. 5.
