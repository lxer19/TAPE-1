Abstract: Exploratory analysis of remotely-sensed data aims at acquiring insight as to the stability of possible classifications of these data and their information value for specific applications. For this purpose, knowledge of the uncertainties underlying these classifications is imperative. In this paper, we introduce various measures that summarise for a classification, in a single number per pixel, the distribution and extent of the uncertainties involved. Since exploratory analysis needs effective ways of conveying information to the user, we in addition address various ways of cartographic visualisation of uncertainty.

Reference-contexts: Some visualisation of data quality is called for. In fact, graphical representation of the quality of remotely-sensed data has recently evolved as a challenging cartographic activity: several interesting representation methods are being explored, building on the possibilities offered by computer technology <ref> (Beard et al., 1991) </ref>. Using the visualisation model of DiBiase (DiBiase et al., 1992), we review several techniques for the visualisation of uncertainty, tailored to the support of exploratory analysis of remotely-sensed data. A distinction is made between static and dynamic visualisation.

Reference-contexts: Conveying uncertainty by means of graphic variables in a static map is firmly rooted in cartographic tradition and can, therefore, benefit from the existence of a sound theoretical framework <ref> (Bertin, 1983) </ref>. Dynamic cartography, on the other hand, is still evolving: its | sometimes | immature concepts have yet to deal with considerations of feasibility, both with regard to technology and perception.

Reference-contexts: The resulting bivariate maps are highly informative, reflecting the strengths with which the classes have been assigned to the various pixels. The high information content, however, produces a complex interpretation key. Moreover, colours with low saturation may be difficult to distinguish, thus contributing to confusion in the interpretation <ref> (Brown and Van Elzakker, 1993) </ref>. By nature, colour hue fails to give an impression of order as required for conveying the quantitative character of uncertainty. It can nevertheless be applied for this purpose by taking advantage of the subjective associations by which people deal with a sequence of hues.

Reference-contexts: The entropy measure is, however, not the only measure that exhibits this property. In essence, any measure that builds on the notion of weighted uncertainty will do the same thing. As another measure of weighted uncertainty, we briefly discuss the quadratic score <ref> (Glasziou and Hilden, 1989) </ref>. The quadratic score builds on the notion of confirmation. The uncertainty in 7 a single class for a pixel is the amount of probability required to establish this class with complete accuracy.

Reference-contexts: Lunetta et al. (1991) give an overview of the sources of errors and uncertainties in remote-sensing classification. The uncertainty that is introduced during classification of a set of remotely-sensed data is characterised by the probability vectors that are yielded as a byproduct by most probabilistic classification procedures <ref> (Goodchild et al., 1992) </ref>. In a maximum a posteriori classification, for every pixel in the data, a vector of probabilities is calculated that specifies for each recognised class its probability of being the true class. <p> The probability vectors yielded by classifi-cation reflect the differences in uncertainty in the resulting classification and may be considered indicative of dubious classifications, of mixed pixels, of heterogeneous classes, or of fuzzy boundaries between classes <ref> (Goodchild et al., 1992) </ref>. Building on probability vectors, various measures of uncertainty may be used. An example of such a measure is the maximum probability appearing in a probability vector.

Reference-contexts: This implicit "stamp of approval", as Morrison <ref> (Guptill and Morrison, 1995) </ref> calls it, has gradually lost its significance with the advent of computer technology and the dissemination of mapping abilities to application specialists rather than cartographers. On-screen maps are more transitory than paper maps.

Reference-contexts: An error matrix is created for the classification by matching a random sample and its counterpart from a reference data set representing the actual environment. From such a matrix, various statistics are derived <ref> (Janssen and Van der Wel, 1994) </ref>. Accuracy 1 assessment based on an error matrix, however, has several drawbacks. Among these is the non-spatial and general character of a global statement like 95% accuracy for an entire classification.

Reference-contexts: Sound can facilitate the visualisation of uncertainty while preserving the static graphic variables for the thematic information of the classification at hand. The perceptual consequences of exploiting sound for conveying information have, however, hardly been explored <ref> (Krygier, 1994) </ref>. A traditional many-coloured map of a remote-sensing classification and its associated maximum probability grey-scale map may be toggled to result in a combined sensation of classes and uncertainty in a dynamic map pair. The time lapse between the alternating display of maps can generally be selected interactively.
