Abstract: WWW Information: The Modelling Challenge was issued in IOPener Vol 2, No. 4. It was motivated by the report that participants in a case study had felt that Role Activity Diagrams gave less information about the end-to-end ow of a process than IDEF0. This report was given in the authors Comments on the use of RADs in case studies (http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/ipg/publications.html). A complete set of responses was published in IOPener Vol. 3 No. 1. First of all, I seek to provide some background on my use of Role Activity Diagrams (RADs). A number of recent collaborative projects with different companies has suggested to me that RADs are a very useful way of modelling activity. In particular, it is the modularity of RADs that seems to be important. Each role represents a module of activity with its own (internal and external) coordination characteristics and support requirements. A process can be configured through the assemblage of roles. A role may occur more than once in a process and indeed may be shared by different processes. Therefore a role, as expressed in a RAD, is a building block which we can use to understand and assemble processes. Furthermore, it seems that the best way to understand what we want of technology comes from an understanding of the activities we wish it to serve or enable. A RAD role can be described as a neat little package which represents activity and the technology required by that activity. I am hinting at the utility of RADs as reusable components in process design/redesign projects but have no cause to develop this point further at the present time. Now, we need to be clear about the comment which has given rise to this challenge. Reporting my favourable impressions of RADs in the last IOPener I noted criticisms made of them by some participants in the collaborative projects, viz: RADs give less information about what makes an activity happen than IDEF0, and are less well suited to expressing the overall ow and structure of an end to end process. It is the second of these points which we discuss through this modelling challenge. It arose because when wishing to consider the process as a whole (customer request through to satisfaction) the participants preferred to look at an IDEF0 representation rather than an equivalent RAD. This preference might be accounted for by many factors. Perhaps it was the nature of the process under consideration, the interpretation of the notations by the modeller, the backgrounds of the participants, or something integral to the RAD and IDEF0 notations themselves. In this challenge the issue has been simplified by concentrating only upon the last of these variables. That is, is there is something inherent in IDEF0 and RADs that makes each more suited to a different kind of modelling? It seems reasonable to suppose that this is the case. Moreover, to state my own position, I suspect that there are good reasons to use IDEF0 to model a process at a high level and to use RADs to represent the lower level activities which take place within this process. However it is difficult, and probably unnecessary, to formulate firm principles.
