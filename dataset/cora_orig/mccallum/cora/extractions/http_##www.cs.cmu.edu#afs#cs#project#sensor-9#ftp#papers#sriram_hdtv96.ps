Abstract: Compression can be achieved by exploiting knowledge both internal and external to a given image or video source. In this paper, we present means for generating and exploiting the specific external knowledge of a 3D stereoscopic depth map of the given scene to compress the given monoscopic source. Several instances in which the depth map can potentially increase compression or provide improved functionality are presented to motivate further work along this line of reasoning.

Reference-contexts: motion parallel to the scene ) Extracted object (trajectory over time to be estimated) Fig. 2: (b) Nonstationary background identification and mosic construction interactively manipulate scene objects, and easy indexing / retrieval capabilities, as reflected by the synthetic/natural hybrid coding (SNHC) proposals call ed for by the MPEG-4 standardization committee <ref> [1] </ref>. For instance, the task might be to replace the natural background with a synthetic background or to render the given scene from a different perspective or to retrieve a specified object in the scene from a video database.

Reference-contexts: This requires thresholding based on depth to identify the background within a frame, and registration of the background from frame to frame, to construct the background mosaic. Several mosaic construction and camera motion stabilization methods are presented in <ref> [2, 4] </ref>. Once the background mosaic has been obtained, it can be compressed as a single still image; as in the stationary case, the cost over time of maintaining even a very high resolution mosaic is very small.

Reference-contexts: Once again the knowledge abo ut the depth greatly simplifies the identification of the background. Compared to the layered coding approach reported in <ref> [3] </ref>, the availability of the depth map can considerably reduce the high computational complexity.

Reference-contexts: It should, however, be noted that the advantage that segment tracking based coding brings must be evaluated against the increase in the bit-rate arising from the need for transmitting the depth map. Segment tracking along with depth--based disambiguation was employed in a stereoscopic sequence coding context in <ref> [5] </ref>. A stereoscopic pair of frames were segmented based on disparity and inter-frame motion using quadtree decomposition and the segments so obtained were tracked from frame to frame in both the sequences over time till the next segmented frame. <p> This requires suitable scaling of the disparity map, detection of occluded areas and areas with disparity estimation errors, and suitable prediction/interpolation strategies for obtaining a disparity estimate for such areas <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. A brief review of different synthesis techniques along with a new efficient scheme for synthesis from block-based disparity maps can be found in [ 6, 7 ]. <p> Also, in applications that require transmission of the depth map, a compact representation of the depth map is vital. We have employed a disparity-adaptive segmentation method to create a sparse representation for the disparity (depth) map in <ref> [5] </ref>. Also it has to be borne in mind that depth values for pixels in the main view that are occluded in the auxiliary view cannot be estimated, which can affect the performance of the algorithm that uses the depth map.
