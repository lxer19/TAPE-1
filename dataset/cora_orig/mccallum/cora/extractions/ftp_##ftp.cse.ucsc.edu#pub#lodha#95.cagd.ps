Abstract: The computational complexity of general change of basis algorithms from one bivariate polynomial basis of degree n to another bivariate polynomial basis of degree n using matrix multiplication is O(n 4 ). Applying blossoming and duality, we derive change of basis algorithms with computational complexity O(n 3 ) between two important classes of polynomial bases used for representing surfaces in CAGD: B-bases and L-bases. Change of basis algorithms for B-bases follow from their blossoming property; change of basis algorithms for L-bases follow from the duality between L-bases and B-bases. The Bezier and multinomial bases are special cases of both B-bases and L-bases, so these algorithms can be used to convert between the Bezier and multinomial forms. We also show that the bivariate Horner evaluation algorithm for the multinomial basis is dual to the bivariate de Boor evaluation algorithm for B-patches.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The purpose of this paper is to derive efficient change of basis algorithms for surfaces represented in terms of B-bases or L-bases. This work extends similar results by Goldman and Barry <ref> [GB92] </ref> on change of basis algorithms for curves represented in terms of univariate B-splines or polya bases. Our work easily generalizes to higher dimensions. Nevertheless, for the sake of simplicity, the results are presented and derived here only for surfaces. <p> However, we shall refer to this basis as the multinomial basis in accordance with <ref> [GB92] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Similar results can be obtained by generalizing the de Boor-Fix dual functionals [dBF73] from curves to surfaces <ref> [LG94] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Also there is a need to investigate other B-bases and L-bases that are useful in CAGD. We plan to investigate bivariate Newton and Lagrange L-bases and the dual Newton dual and power B-bases in a forthcoming paper <ref> [LG95] </ref>. Some properties, such as differentiation, are simple for B-bases; other properties, such as degree elevation, are simple for L-bases. It would be useful to study the dual analogues to these formulas. Finally, the change of basis techniques discussed in this work are local.

Reference-contexts: Ramshaw's blossoming recurrence diagram <ref> [Ram87] </ref> for the cubic case is shown in Figure 1. Appropriate multisets of three vectors from the knot-net lie at the base of the pyramid. We shall interpret the meaning of these multisets shortly in Section 2.2 as the value of the blossom of a B-patch evaluated at these multisets.

Reference-contexts: This procedure is the same as the evaluation algorithm for multinomial polynomials described by Schumaker and Volk <ref> [SV86] </ref>. The above algorithm requires two divisions. However it is possible to carry out this computation without divisions although at the expense of some additional multiplications.
