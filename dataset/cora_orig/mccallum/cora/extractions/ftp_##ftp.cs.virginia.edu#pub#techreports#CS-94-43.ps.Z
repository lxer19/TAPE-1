Reference-contexts: This, of course, may be a consequence of this particular problem. We cannot give a direct comparison of our results with <ref> [7] </ref> since they used larger problem sizes than we could. For example, for a 512fi512 grid, they reported a time (on 256 processors of an NCUBE2) of 237 seconds for GMRES using 64 vectors and with one GS step as the preconditioner. <p> On this particular problem, a factor of six improvement would have made the SOR preconditioner comparable to their best least squares polynomial preconditioner, which in turn was far slower than a multigrid preconditioner. However, on the other three (and more difficult) problems in <ref> [7] </ref> the multigrid and polynomial preconditioners did not show such superiority and, in fact, failed on some problems. We next consider (5.2), which was Problem 4 in [7]. Table 5 gives results for a nominal value of fi = 100 and for 64 GMRES vectors. <p> However, on the other three (and more difficult) problems in <ref> [7] </ref> the multigrid and polynomial preconditioners did not show such superiority and, in fact, failed on some problems.

Reference-contexts: We note that we also ran the problem of Table 5 using 32 GMRES vectors but the results were considerably worse. 6 BiCGSTAB We next give some experimental results using BiCGSTAB <ref> [8] </ref> as the base iteration. Table 6 is for the model equation (2.1) and corresponds to Table 1. We see that, as with GMRES and as expected, the natural and red/black orderings are comparable.
