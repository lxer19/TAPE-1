Title: Interactive Modeling using Surface Splines  
Author: Carlos Gonzalez Ochoa Aleman 
Affiliation: Department of Computer Sciences Purdue University  
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a direct manipulation framework to model surface splines [ Peters, 1993 ] . The framework presents the designer with intuitive tools to control the surface, however, the designer does not have to know any details of how the surface is represented. The surface spline is a parametric representation that permits us to model objects of arbitrary topology. The representation is simple enough to formulate intuitive tools, to control and model the surface. Tools intuitive to designers, such that smooth or create creases on a surface, follow the characteristics that define surface splines. We present some details of the creation of these tools.

Reference-contexts: While direct 3D user input devices have been used with relative success to control traditional CAD environments, these systems are limited to CSG and polygonal meshes. Other alternatives to direct manipulation are physical based modeling <ref> [ Barzel and Barr, 1988 ] </ref> and freeform deformation [ Sederberg and Parry, 1986 ] . These paradigms permit a wide variety of intuitive distortions and simple modifications to the object if maintained simple. For complex distortions such as twists and bends, they may produce singularities and self-intersections.

Reference-contexts: At this time, in the context of the 3D modeling paradigm, the problem is still not completely solved. Work in direct manipulation [ Chiyokura and Kimura, 1983 ] has focused more on polygonal models and less on curves and surfaces. Systems based on virtual tools <ref> [ Bill and Lodha, 1995 ] </ref> have appeared but are limited only to polygonal meshes because of the complexity of their internal representation. <p> Fragmentation One problem associated with interactive modeling using virtual tools over polygonal meshes is to decide how and where to fragment the mesh to elongate it or smooth it. This problem described by Lodha and Bill <ref> [ Bill and Lodha, 1995 ] </ref> states that, as the surface grows larger or needs to become smoother, it should be fragmented to accommodate further changes. This problem occurs when the manipulation is concentrated over a small part of the surface.

Reference-contexts: Recently, the use of sketching [ Zeleznik et al., 1996 ] to define a 3D object has become a popular research topic. To translate the sketch into a complete and unambiguous representation of the object, specially when free-form surfaces are required <ref> [ Branco et al., 1994 ] </ref> is still not completely solved. Other representations used to do modeling are vox-els [ Wang and Kaufman, 1995 ] and particles [ Szeliski and Tonnesen, 1992 ] .

Reference-contexts: Direct manipulation of curves and surfaces is considered a more difficult problem [ Yamashita and Fukui, 1993 ] because of their non-linear behavior and the com-plexity of classifying points. As an example, direct manipulation of tensor-product bezier patches was presented by Fowler <ref> [ Fowler, 1992 ] </ref> . He presented a process to determine how to change the control points of the patch to certain geometric constraints. While direct 3D user input devices have been used with relative success to control traditional CAD environments, these systems are limited to CSG and polygonal meshes.

Reference-contexts: In general, this kind of modelers are based on polygonal meshes and only few of these support smooth surfaces. The representation most commonly used for meshes is one based on a variation of a B-rep, and smooth surfaces are most often represented using parametric basis functions <ref> [ Hoschek and Lasser, 1993, pp 250 ] </ref> . The drawback of surface modelers is the use of multiple surfaces as individual entities, that is, each surface is isolated from each other.

Reference-contexts: This process is computationally more expensive than for polygonal models, requiring many faces to obtain an accurate approximation of the surface. The problem of interaction is based on the fact that it is easier to manipulate surfaces indirectly by manipulating control points <ref> [ Kuriyama and Tachibana, 1995 ] </ref> than to directly control the surface. 1.3 Direct Manipulation One fundamental issue of interaction is direct manipulation; Sutherland considered it as one of the ten unsolved problems in computer graphics.

Reference-contexts: Some operations may not correspond to physical manipulations but are easy to develop or compute. Operations that are intuitive, such as hands modeling clay, are much more complex to develop. 1.1 Issues in interactive modeling Traditional modeling is based on the use of sketches and illustrations <ref> [ Mitchell and McCullough, 1995 ] </ref> to come up with an idea and then creating a prototype. These models are time consuming, difficult and sometimes hazardous to create (e.g. molding plastics and resins), and in general cannot be modified afterwards. Creating them, especially when many revisions are made, is expensive.

Reference-contexts: The focus is the modification of the shape of objects directly by the designer, which we will refer to as interactive modeling. The ultimate goal in interactive modeling is to simulate modeling with a flexible material similar to clay <ref> [ Pentland, 1986 ] </ref> , and to be able to modify it in real time. The ideal system would respond immediately and accurately to the gestures and movements of the designer's hands.

Reference-contexts: For complex distortions such as twists and bends, they may produce singularities and self-intersections. This makes them more suitable for animation than for engineering tasks. 2 Surface representation We choose surface splines <ref> [ Peters, 1993 ] </ref> as our basic surface representation because of their built-in smoothness, low degree, simple interpolation and local convex hull properties which yield a predictable shape. Surface splines represent a parametric 3D surface similar to a carpet of piecewise polynomial surfaces that maintain certain conditions of continuity. <p> The first two parameters define the input mesh. From the input mesh we construct a dual mesh by cutting edges based on the mesh connectivity and the blend ratios. On the dual mesh we use Peters' corner cutting <ref> [ Peters, 1993 ] </ref> algorithm to define, on the user's choice, triangular or tensor product patches of degree 2 or 3. 2.1 Interaction paradigm Our approach to direct manipulation consists of the use of virtual tools (controlled by 3D or 2D input devices) to control the surface.

Reference-contexts: The overhead comes from the time spent by the application to validate the model after applying each operation.

Modeling with particles is achieved by defining the particles' positions, the force-repulsion factor between each other, and other shape constraints by a set of equations.
