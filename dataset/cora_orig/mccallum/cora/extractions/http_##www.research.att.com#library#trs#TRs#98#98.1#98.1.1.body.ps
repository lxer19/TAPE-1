Reference-contexts: Protocol cascade is (i) effective, (ii) unforgeable under the SDL assumption, (iii) restrictive (see Prerequisite 1) and (iv) unconditionally blind in the sense that Bob's results from executing protocol cascade are unconditionally unlinkable to Alice's views of these executions. 3 2.4 Diverted Proof of Knowledge Brands <ref> [B93] </ref> has proposed an interactive proof based on work of Chaum, Evertse and van de Graaf [CEG88] where a prover P proves to a verifier V that she knows a witness, namely a representation u = (u 1 ; : : : ; u l ) 2 ZZ q l , <p> For all l &gt; 1, this interactive proof is witness indistinguishable over the predicate family W [FS90], where W = fW q g and W q = f ( ; w)j = i=1 g u i i g. Brands has further shown in <ref> [B93] </ref> how his proof protocol can be "diverted" such that (i) P , during the interactive proof protocol with V , has online access to a third party, called the co-prover Q, and (ii) the witness u is shared between P and Q in a way that neither P nor Q

Reference-contexts: Biometric verification facilities need to distinguish only one particular identity from all others, whereas biometric recognition facilities need to distinguish a (large) number of biometric identities from each other. Recently, there is increasing scientific and commercial interest in biometric person authentication <ref> [BCB97] </ref>. A growing number of easy-to-use computer peripherals is available in the consumer market (e.g., www.abio.com, www.digitalpersona.com, www.identix.com).

Reference-contexts: Choosing an element uniformly at random from a set A and assigning it to a variable a is denoted a 2 R A. Evaluating an expression E and assigning the result to a is denoted by a left arrow a E. By h we denote a pseudo-random hash function <ref> [BR93] </ref> that, on input any binary string, returns a value in ZZ q . We relax the notation by allowing any number of arguments to h meaning that their binary representations are concatenated and then fed to h.

Reference-contexts: All observers share a co-signing key x O , whose corresponding co-verification key y O is also broadcast to all road checkpoints and is built into all wallets. 5 Other examples of this more general notion of divertibility of proofs of knowledge have been considered by Chen <ref> [C94] </ref>, but a formal definition is outstanding. 6 In a more integrated system, the issuers of different kinds of certificates could rationalize this approach by establishing a pseudonym binding center and relying upon the same binding procedure. 7 This signing key serves to issue one kind of driver's license.

Reference-contexts: In the following, we explore the latter solution. We assume each driver is equipped with a personal communication device (called wallet for historical reasons) that can run a trusted local process (called observer ) <ref> [CP92] </ref>. For example, wallets and observers could be implemented by palmtops or pilots with a built-in tamper resistant chip [PPSW97]. Drivers need to trust their observers to support all legitimate operations, whereas road checkpoints need to trust observers to prevent any illegitimate operation. <p> Preventing outflow and inflow requires that the observer has no communication link other than to its hosting wallet, and all communication protocols must prevent outflow from the observer (or inflow to the observer). This concept has been introduced by Chaum and Pedersen <ref> [CP92] </ref> as the wallet with observer architecture. Adding a biometric authentication facility to the observer has not been studied for this architecture before (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Wallet with observer architecture Each observer needs to be personalized to its respective owner in a way that is trusted by the MVS. <p> Hence, follows the claim. ut 4 Conclusions and Open Questions We have proposed an efficient implementation for electronic driver's licenses that drivers can freely carry around in small personal devices. Our proposal is based on the wallet with observer architecture proposed by Chaum and Pedersen <ref> [CP92] </ref>. Since transferability of driver's licenses can only be prevented by some kind of biometric driver authentication, we propose to implant some biometric verification facility into the observer.

Reference-contexts: The phrase "proceed iff P " with P a Boolean predicate indicates that the protocol execution proceeds if and only if P holds. Otherwise, the protocol is aborted and the participants return a corresponding exception. Polynomial composition of protocols <ref> [FS90] </ref> means to execute a given set of protocols a polynomial number of times in arbitrarily interleaved fashion. 2.2 Restrictive Blind Signature Scheme The signer Alice chooses her private key x 2 R ZZ q uniformly at random and publishes the corresponding public key y g x mod p. <p> For all l &gt; 1, this interactive proof is witness indistinguishable over the predicate family W <ref> [FS90] </ref>, where W = fW q g and W q = f ( ; w)j = i=1 g u i i g. <p> From Prerequisite 3 we have that protocol prove is witness indistinguishable for predicate W q , and according to Feige, Shamir <ref> [FS90] </ref> this also holds for any polynomial composition of protocol prove. Hence, follows the claim. ut 4 Conclusions and Open Questions We have proposed an efficient implementation for electronic driver's licenses that drivers can freely carry around in small personal devices.

Reference-contexts: In contrast to the well-defined notion of divertibility by Okamoto and Ohta <ref> [OO90] </ref>, the "diverted" proof protocol by Brands takes private input not only from the co-prover, but also from the prover, and there is no input common 3 For simplicity, we assume only one such generator g.
