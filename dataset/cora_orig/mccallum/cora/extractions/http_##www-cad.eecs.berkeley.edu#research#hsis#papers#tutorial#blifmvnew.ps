Title: Abstract  
Abstract: This document serves to define and extend BLIF-MV, adding some new constructs and making some syntactical changes. BLIF-MV is an intermediate format used as input to synthesis and verification systems. Synthesis subsets of high-level languages, such as Verilog, VHDL, and Esterel, can be mapped to BLIF-MV. Our contributions are as follows:

Reference-contexts: We consider the following concurrency models: selection/resolution model ([Agg83]) used in COSPAN ([Har90]), shared-variable used in Murphi ([Dil92]), and CSP-like message-passing used in many systems and languages. This paper summarizes our experiences in the past three years with building an intermediate format for verification and synthesis. The first, <ref> [Bra91] </ref>, was implemented in HSIS. This document is the result of efforts to overcome certain bottlenecks and deficiencies. We believe that BLIF-MV can be easily used as an intermediate format for verification and synthesis systems, possibly for hardware/software co-synthesis as well, spanning an even larger spectrum in system design.
