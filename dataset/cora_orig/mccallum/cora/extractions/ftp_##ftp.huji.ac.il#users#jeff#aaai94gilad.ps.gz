Abstract: In some domains, however, it may be possible for beneficial agreements to be reached among sub-groups of agents, who might be individually motivated to work together to the exclusion of others outside the group. This paper considers this more general case of n-agent coalition formation. We present a simple coalition formation mechanism that uses cryptographic techniques for subadditive Task Oriented Domains. The mechanism is efficient, symmetric, and individual rational. When the domain is also concave, the mechanism also satisfies coalition rationality.

Reference-contexts: Sub-groups cannot make sub-agreements that exclude other members of the group. Interesting variations on these approaches, which nonetheless remain bilateral in essence, are the Contract Net (Smith 1978), which allows bilateral agreement in n-agent environments, and bilateral negotiation among two sub-groups discussed in <ref> (Kraus, Wilkenfeld, & Zlotkin 1995) </ref>. In some domains, however, it may be possible for beneficial agreements to be reached among sub-groups of agents, who might be individually motivated to work together to the exclusion of others outside the group.

Reference-contexts: Coalitions An Example|The Tileworld Consider the following simple example in a multi-agent version of the Tileworld <ref> (Pollack & Ringuette 1990) </ref> (see Figure 1). A single hole in the grid is represented by a framed letter (such as a ). Each agent's position is marked by its name (such as A 1 ). Tiles are represented by black squares ( ) inside the grid squares.

Reference-contexts: Mechanisms for Subadditive TODs We would like to set up rules of interaction such that communities of self-interested agents will form beneficial coalitions. There are several attributes of the rules of interaction that might be important to the designers of these self-interested agents (as discussed further in <ref> (Rosenschein 1993) </ref>): 1. Efficiency: The agents should not squander resources when they come to an agreement; there should not be wasted utility when an agreement is reached.

Reference-contexts: T k will also be called A k 's goal. The Postmen Domain <ref> (Zlotkin & Rosenschein 1989) </ref> is one classic example of a TOD. In this domain, each agent is given a set of letters to deliver to various nodes on a graph; starting and ending at the Post Office, the agents are to traverse the graph and make their deliveries.

Reference-contexts: When two agents form a coalition it means that they are coordinating their actions. The utility of an agent from a joint plan that achieves his goal is the difference between the cost of achieving his goal alone and the cost of his part of the joint plan <ref> (Zlotkin & Rosenschein 1991) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This paper considers this more general case of n-agent coalition formation (recent pieces of work on similar topics are (Ketchpel 1993; Shechory & Kraus 1993)). Building on our previous work <ref> (Zlotkin & Rosenschein 1993a) </ref>, which dealt only with bilateral negotiation mechanisms, we here analyze the kinds of n-agent coordination mechanisms that can be used in specific classes of domains. <p> A given coalition is guaranteed to get a certain utility, regardless of what coalitions are formed by the other agents. In the Tile-world domain this assumption is not necessarily true| though it is true in the example we gave above. We will see below that in Task Oriented Domains <ref> (Zlotkin & Rosenschein 1993a) </ref> this definition of the coalition value is directly applicable. <p> Theorem 5 [Shapley (1971)] (Shapley 1971): In convex coalition games, the Shapley Value always satisfies the criterion of coalition rationality. 4 The cost of a set of tasks needs to be calculated only a linear number of times. 5 The definition is from <ref> (Zlotkin & Rosenschein 1993a) </ref>. In concave TODs, the Shapley-based mechanism introduced above is fully stable, i.e., satisfies individual, group, and coalition rationality.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 1 Any encounter (T 1 ; : : :; T n ) in a subad-ditive TOD induces a superadditive coalition game (N; v). Proof.
