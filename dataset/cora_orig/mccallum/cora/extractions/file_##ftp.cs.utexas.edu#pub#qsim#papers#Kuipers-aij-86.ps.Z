Abstract: Qualitative simulation is a key inference process in qualitative causal reasoning. However, the precise meaning of the different proposals and their relation with differential equations is often unclear. In this paper, we present a precise definition of qualitative structure and behavior descriptions as abstractions of differential equations and continuously differentiable functions. We present a new algorithm for qualitative simulation that generalizes the best features of existing algorithms, and allows direct comparisons among alternate approaches. Starting with a set of constraints abstracted from a differential equation, we prove that the QSIM algorithm is guaranteed to produce a qualitative behavior corresponding to any solution to the original equation. We also show that any qualitative simulation algorithm will sometimes produce spurious qualitative behaviors: ones which do not correspond to any mechanism satisfying the given constraints. These observations suggest specific types of care that must be taken in designing applications of qualitative causal reasoning systems, and in constructing and validating a knowledge base of mechanism descriptions. Keywords: qualitative simulation, qualitative mathematics, naive physics.

Reference-contexts: A physical system is characterized by a number of real-valued parameters, which vary continuously over time. We consider each physical parameter to be a function f : [a; b] ! &lt; fl , where &lt; fl = <ref> [1; 1] </ref>, the extended real number line. The domain and range of a function f are both closed intervals in the extended reals, &lt; fl . <p> The function f : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! &lt; fl is defined to be continuous at 1 exactly if lim t!1 f (t) exists. For example, both e t and e t are continuously differentiable on [0; 1], but sin t is not. <p> The function f : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! &lt; fl is defined to be continuous at 1 exactly if lim t!1 f (t) exists. For example, both e t and e t are continuously differentiable on [0; 1], but sin t is not. <p> A qualitative functional relationship need not be strictly monotonic if it can be divided into sections that are alternately increasing or decreasing monotonic, with critical points at the joints between sections. For example, suppose that x = cos for x 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref> and 2 [0; 2]. <p> First, the dynamical systems approach to qualitative analysis of differential equations (e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>) has greater expressive and inferential power than local qualitative simulation methods.

Reference-contexts: Note that M + (f; g) does not imply that f and g are monotonic functions on [a; b]. For example, M + (2 sin t; sin t) holds on <ref> [0; 2] </ref>, where H (x) = 2x. Proposition 2 Consider two continuously differentiable functions f; g : [a; b] ! &lt; fl , where M + (f; g). <p> A qualitative functional relationship need not be strictly monotonic if it can be divided into sections that are alternately increasing or decreasing monotonic, with critical points at the joints between sections. For example, suppose that x = cos for x 2 [1; 1] and 2 <ref> [0; 2] </ref>. <p> This approach takes us outside the realm of qualitative simulation, and into the realm of problem formulation. Chi, Feltovich, and Glaser <ref> [2] </ref> have shown that expert causal reasoning involves the use of domain-specific knowledge to select the correct formulation of a problem, leading to its direct solution.

Reference-contexts: Such sequences of 7 states appear to be required when the computational inference cycle must run more than once to generate a state corresponding to the next physical state. De Kleer and Bobrow <ref> [6] </ref> adopt the standard model for quantities, but appear less committed to alternating points and intervals in the time domain. Kuipers [16] and Williams [24,25] follow the standard model. <p> The restriction to boundary elements handles the case where f becomes constant over an interval: only the endpoints of the interval are distinguished time-points. De Kleer and Bobrow <ref> [6] </ref> eliminate this case by assuming that parameters have derivatives of all orders, in which case any function which is constant over an interval is constant everywhere. All functions mentioned in the rest of this paper should be presumed reasonable unless specified otherwise. <p> That is, only if we may conclude from this simulation that V (t 4 ) = V (t 0 ). A match between the states t 4 and t 0 in this behavior suppresses the distinction between increasing, stable, or decreasing amplitude (see figure 7). De Kleer and Bobrow <ref> [6] </ref> present an example of a spring with frictional damping, whose actual behavior is a decreasing oscillation. The behavioral description they present is cyclic, and similar to that given in figure 6, with the addition of terms for the frictional force.

Reference-contexts: The behavioral description may be used to explain a set of observations or the way a mechanism produces its behavior. Researchers working in different problem domains have taken very different approaches to the derivation of constraint equations from physical structure. De Kleer and Brown <ref> [8] </ref> and Williams [25] describe a physical system in terms of components and connections. Constraint equations are derived from the component models and from the interaction paths provided by the connections. <p> This point of view has led them to propose principles of good form, such as "No Function in Structure," which states that component models must be formulated independently of the device contexts in which they will appear <ref> [8] </ref>. Studying naive physics reasoning about everyday physical situations, Forbus [12] determines the current set of active processes. The constraint equations are derived from the complete set of currently active processes. <p> Both Forbus [10,12] and de Kleer and Brown <ref> [8] </ref> adopt non-standard models of time in which "mythical" or "infinitesimal" time may separate qualitative states that correspond to the same physical point in time. <p> In de Kleer and Brown's case we may define a translated variable W (t) = V (t) V fl so that W (t) = 0 corresponds to V (t) = V fl <ref> [8] </ref>. In both cases, when the system is approaching its initial state both position and velocity are approaching limits, with no way to determine which arrives first.

Reference-contexts: This point of view has led them to propose principles of good form, such as "No Function in Structure," which states that component models must be formulated independently of the device contexts in which they will appear [8]. Studying naive physics reasoning about everyday physical situations, Forbus <ref> [12] </ref> determines the current set of active processes. The constraint equations are derived from the complete set of currently active processes. Working primarily in medical physiology, Kuipers [16,19] treats constraint equations as given, either by textbook or experiential learning, but outside the scope of immediate causal problem-solving. <p> Kuipers [16] expresses an increasing monotonic relationship between X and Y as Y = M + (X ) or M + (X; Y ), meaning that there is some well-defined but unspecified function f with the desired properties, such that Y = f (X). Forbus <ref> [12] </ref> uses the notation X / Q+ Y , meaning that Y = f (: : : X; : : :) where the dependence of Y on X is monotonically increasing, all else held equal. <p> In Forbus' case, we introduce a landmark value initial length (S) for the initial displacement of the spring mass, such that A [initial length (S)] &gt; A [rest length (s)] <ref> [12, pp. 144-146] </ref>. In de Kleer and Brown's case we may define a translated variable W (t) = V (t) V fl so that W (t) = 0 corresponds to V (t) = V fl [8]. <p> When the constraints are constructed by hand, this can be done by exhibiting the ODE that they abstract. However if the set of constraints is to be derived automatically from the current process structure <ref> [12] </ref>, guaranteeing consistency may be more difficult. * If qualitative simulation yields several possible behaviors, further anal ysis is required before concluding that they represent possible futures. <p> Returning to the larger problem of qualitative causal reasoning about mechanisms, an important problem is to formulate a suitable set of constraints given a physical situation, using the device-topology approach of de Kleer, Brown and Bobrow [6,8], the process-based approach of Forbus <ref> [12] </ref>, or some approach yet to be discovered. 47

Reference-contexts: The goal of this paper is to clarify and formalize the qualitative mathematics behind the prediction of behavior from qualitative constraint equations. The the results presented here apply across approaches to qualitative physics. The representation for constraints and behavior was originally described in <ref> [16] </ref>. The QSIM algorithm presented here replaces the previous ENV qualitative simulation algorithm. <p> Values defining operating region boundaries may also be used, but they are not part of the qualitative addition and multiplication operations. Forbus [10,12] and Kuipers <ref> [16] </ref> define a quantity space as a partially ordered set of landmark values, so that a quantity is described in terms of its ordinal relations with the landmarks. The Kuipers [16] approach is different from the others in allowing new landmarks to be discovered during the qualitative simulation, and used to <p> Forbus [10,12] and Kuipers <ref> [16] </ref> define a quantity space as a partially ordered set of landmark values, so that a quantity is described in terms of its ordinal relations with the landmarks. The Kuipers [16] approach is different from the others in allowing new landmarks to be discovered during the qualitative simulation, and used to define new qualitative distinctions. <p> De Kleer and Bobrow [6] adopt the standard model for quantities, but appear less committed to alternating points and intervals in the time domain. Kuipers <ref> [16] </ref> and Williams [24,25] follow the standard model. As Williams' work and this paper demonstrate, the standard model makes it possible to state and prove useful theorems about the validity of the predictions made by qualitative simulation. <p> Although constraints for expressing monotonic relationships are used by all researchers on qualitative simulation, the precise definition of the constraint varies significantly. Kuipers <ref> [16] </ref> expresses an increasing monotonic relationship between X and Y as Y = M + (X ) or M + (X; Y ), meaning that there is some well-defined but unspecified function f with the desired properties, such that Y = f (X).

Reference-contexts: In both cases, when the system is approaching its initial state both position and velocity are approaching limits, with no way to determine which arrives first. Without the translated variable, neither approach expresses the distinction between increasing, steady, and decreasing amplitudes <ref> [17] </ref>. 44 As the simulation approaches t = t 4 , there is no local rule that can determine whether V reaches V fl before, after, or at the same time as X and A reach zero.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the number of constraints visited is proportional to the total number of tuples, which is linear in the number of constraints. Each visit takes bounded time. Thus, Waltz filtering takes o (c) time <ref> [22] </ref>. 1 Some possible heuristics include: * (Quiescence.) If all functions have derivative zero, conclude that the system is quiescent, the new time-point is the endpoint of the domain (possibly t = 1), and do not place the new state on ACTIVE. * (No Divergence.) In physical systems, eliminate transitions in <p> Typically, the remaining space is small, but unfortunately there are pathological cases which yield 2 p possible successor states. * The most expensive of the global filters is the check for previous iden tical states, which requires o (pt) time. Mackworth and Freuder <ref> [22] </ref> show that in a sparse graph such as this, an interpretation satisfying the constraints may be generated in linear time. However, the number of global interpretations may be exponential in the number of parameters, and the QSIM algorithm generates them all.

Reference-contexts: To be pairwise consistent, tuples on adjacent constraints must assign the same transition to the function they share. For certain tuples, there may be no opposite number to make such a consistent pair. If so, that tuple may be deleted.
