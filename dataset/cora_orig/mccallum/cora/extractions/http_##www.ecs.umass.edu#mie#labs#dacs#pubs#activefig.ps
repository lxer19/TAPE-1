Abstract: In this paper we take a closer look at the prevalent notion that adaptive filters are preferred to fixed-filters in cancelling noise in ducts. For this purpose, we consider an active noise control (ANC) system with configuration similar to that used in most adaptive implementations; i.e., a duct equipped with both feedforward and feedback sensors and a control speaker. Our design of a linear, time-invariant controller involves three steps: (1) system identification from the experimental duct frequency response, (2) H 1 synthesis using the identified plant and model errors, and (3) use of Quanti- tative Feedback Theory (QFT) to further improve performance by sequential tuning of the feedback and feedforward filters by using the experimental data. Preliminary experiments indicate that attenuation levels of at least 10-20 dB are achievable over a 400 Hz band. An important consequence of LTI designs is that the performance is guaranteed for wide-band noise as well as pure tone disturbances and, unlike adaptive schemes, stability and performance can be guaranteed beforehand.

Reference-contexts: The state-of-the-art in ANC in ducts uses adaptive feed- forward algorithms primarily derived from adaptive noise cancellation techniques; see Widrow et al. (1975) for an introduction to adaptive filtering with application to ANC. Despite the positive outlook in a recent ANC review paper <ref> (Fuller and von Flotow, 1995) </ref>, adaptive schemes suffer drawbacks including instability (Jiang et al., 1995) and a lack of understanding, especially in the presence of acoustic feedback which is prevalent in duct systems; see Nelson and Elliot (1992).

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Historically, ANC in ducts has been the focus of much attention, since successful duct silencing has a commercial potential <ref> (Nelson and Elliot, 1992) </ref>. For example, active noise reduction in automobile exhaust systems reduces back pressure on the engine thereby increasing engine efficiency as well as attenuating low-frequency engine noise that traditional mu*ers fail to quiet.
