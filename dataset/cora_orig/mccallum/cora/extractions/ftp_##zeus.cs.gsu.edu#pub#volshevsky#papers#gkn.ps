Abstract: Two geometric characteristics, namely cyclic dimensions and kernel multiplicities, are introduced for a square matrix. The connection between these characteristics and Gohberg-Kaashoek numbers is studied. On this basis two simple geometric proofs are given for the theorem about the change of the Jordan structure of a given matrix under small perturbation.

Reference-contexts: For convenience we set m i (A; 0 ) = 0 (i = t + 1; t + 2; :::; n). The numbers m i (A) = 2oe (A) are referred to as Gohberg-Kaashoek numbers.

Reference-contexts: The vector k = fk i g n 1 is referred to as dual to fm i g n 1 if it satisfies k i = max fl : m l ig: Following <ref> [MO, 7.B] </ref> introduce for fm i g n 1 the incidence matrix B 2 C nfim 1 , so that the first m i entries in the i-th row of B are ones, and the other entries of the i-th row are zeros (i = 1; :::; n). <p> Counting in this matrix the the column sums, one obtains that the dual vector is given by fk i g 5 1 = 3 2 2 1 0 . The following lemma is combined from the statements 7.B.2 and 7.B.5 in <ref> [MO] </ref>. LEMMA 2.1 Let fk i g n 1 and fk 0 1 be the vectors, dual to fm i g n 1 and fm 0 1 , respectively.

Reference-contexts: Note that in case where matrices A 0 and A are selfadjoint with respect to indefinite inner product, there are additional to (0.1) restrictions for the Jordan structure of a perturbation A, see, e.g. <ref> [O1] </ref>, where the role played by the so-called sign characteristic is revealed. Here we may also remark that the proof of the assertion (ii) of Theorem 0.1 makes no difficulties, and that it is essentially reduced to Examples 1 and 2, given in Appendix ( see, e.g. [MP], [DBT] ).

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the relations (3.1) provide a geometric interpretation of algebraic inequalities (2.1). The proof of Theorem 3.2 is based on the following lemma, which was stated in <ref> [O2] </ref>. We provide it here with a short proof. LEMMA 3.3 Let fk (j) i=1 (j = 1; 2; :::; l) be l vectors, which are dual to fm (j) i=1 (j = 1; 2; :::; l), respectively.
