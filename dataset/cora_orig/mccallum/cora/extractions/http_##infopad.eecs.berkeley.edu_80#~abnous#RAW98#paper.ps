Abstract: Programmability is an important capability that provides flexible computing devices, but it incurs significant performance and power penalties. We have proposed an architecture that relies on dynamic reconfiguration of hardware resources to implement low-power and programmable processors for DSP applications. In this paper, we evaluate this architectural approach and compare it to other programmable architectures.

Reference-contexts: The result is a domain-specific processor whose design involves trading off the flexibility of a general-purpose programmable device to achieve higher levels of energy efficiency, while maintaining the flexibility to handle a variety of algorithms within the domain of interest. The Berkeley Pleiades architecture is based on this approach <ref> [1] </ref>. In this paper we analyze the energy-efficiency of the Pleiades architecture, and we compare it to other programmable architectures. 2 Architectural Evaluation For the purposes of this study, we chose a set of programmable architectures ranging from general-purpose microprocessors to field-programmable gate arrays.

Reference-contexts: For this study, we chose two commonly used processors from Texas Instruments: the TMS320C2xx and the TMS320LC54x. The TMS320LC54x is an advanced signal processor that has been designed specifically for low-power operation. Starting with assembly programs published by Texas Instruments in their application reports <ref> [3, 4, 5, 6] </ref>, we created a set of benchmark programs in assembly language. All of these programs include initialization sections that were excluded in the performance and power calculations. A 3.0V supply voltage was used in these calculations.

Reference-contexts: All of these programs include initialization sections that were excluded in the performance and power calculations. A 3.0V supply voltage was used in these calculations. Energy values were calculated by adding the contributions of all instructions in a kernel using instruction-level power consumption data published by Texas Instruments <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. The same method was used to calculate the number of cycles spent executing a kernel. 2.4 XC4003A Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) have recently been used to implement high-throughput DSP applications that are beyond the reach of conventional signal processors. We evaluated the Xilinx XC4003A FPGA in this study.

Therefore, to make a meaningful comparison, we had to normalize the energy and delay values to a reference.
