Abstract: This paper presents a novel scheme for scheduling packet traffic on a wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) local optical network which employs a wavelength router. An N -port latin router allows N 2 fi N 2 connectivity via only N physical wavelengths. We propose TDM schedules for interconnecting MN nodes with a wavelength router. We show that for non-zero transceiver tuning time, throughput on the order of N can be achieved.

Reference-contexts: As of the time of this writing, all single-hop local network protocols for multichannel optical networks have been based on either the passive-star coupler <ref> [1] </ref> [2] [3], the dual optical bus [4], or the optical ring [5]. In this paper, we propose scheduling algorithms for local optical networks using a centralized wavelength router, which has recently been fabricated as an integrated device, called the wavelguide grating multiplexer [6] [7].

Reference-contexts: The wavelength router is based on the principle of latin squares. A latin square is an N fiN matrix where each entry is an element from the set S = f1; 2; :::; N g <ref> [8] </ref>. Each column and row of the matrix contain all of the elements of S, which implies that each column and row must contain each element exactly once.
