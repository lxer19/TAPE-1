Reference-contexts: In view of our results and the formulas for the phase error, we have made series of experiments with a fixed k 3 H 2 as well as k 3 h 2 . 5. Numerical Results The software used was developed with the PETSc library <ref> [1] </ref> supplied by Ar-gonne National laboratories, as well as Matlab (TM), a product of Mathworks, Inc. We would like to acknowledge the generous help of the PETSc implementors in developing and debugging our code.

Reference-contexts: we are exploring the possible benefits of a coarse solver as a part of our preconditioner; we note that the use of a coarse space correction is required to establish convergence of domain decomposition algorithms for a class of nonsymmetric and indefinite elliptic problems previously considered by Cai and Widlund <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. We also take advantage of well-known accelerators of the basic iteration schemes, in particular the GMRES algorithm. We refer to Smith, Bjtrstad, and Gropp [11] for an introduction to domain decomposition methods in general, and these ideas in particular. <p> Theoretical Results Optimal convergence has been established for ALG1 and ALG2, with a coarse space V H and GMRES acceleration, using essentially only our older theory; see <ref> [2, 3] </ref> or [11, Chapter 5.4]. Our result is also valid for ALG3 in the case when there are no cross points.

Reference-contexts: While this is, quite possibly, a new type of overlapping Schwarz methods, we have been inspired to develop this idea by the thesis of Despres <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It can be argued that an alternative boundary condition, which more closely approximates the correct nonlocal non-reflecting boundary condition, would lead to more rapid convergence. These ideas have indeed been tested with some success by Ghanemi <ref> [5] </ref> and others. This essentially amounts to replacing the ik terms in the interface condition (1) with ikT , where T is an appropriate nonlocal operator. See also [9] for work more closely related to ours.

Reference-contexts: So far, we have worked mainly with OVERLAPPING SCHWARZ ALGORITHMS FOR HELHOLTZ'S EQUATION 439 lower order elements but have made progress towards extending our studies and numerical experiments to spectral elements. Our interest in the spectral element case has been inspired by the work of Ihlen-burg and Babuska <ref> [7, 8, 6] </ref> and the thesis by Melenk [10]. They have considered the well-posedness of the original problem and different finite element discretizations and proven, for a model problem in one dimension, that the basic estimate juj H 1 CkjF j H 1 holds.

We refer to Smith, Bjtrstad, and Gropp <ref> [11] </ref> for an introduction to domain decomposition methods in general, and these ideas in particular. We note that there are a number of variants of the Schwarz algorithms: additive, hybrid, restricted, etc. In our work, we are now focusing on the classical, multiplicative algorithm. 2. <p> Theoretical Results Optimal convergence has been established for ALG1 and ALG2, with a coarse space V H and GMRES acceleration, using essentially only our older theory; see [2, 3] or <ref> [11, Chapter 5.4] </ref>.
