Reference-contexts: For simplicity, we assume that the inputs to the series structure arrive simultaneously and they are sized uniformly; however, reordering of inputs and tapering of the chain of transistors is required for power optimization. Several researchers proposed extension of the inverter based delay model for series connected MOSFETS <ref> [13, 14, 3] </ref>. The problem is commonly framed as that of finding the equivalent width of a single inverter that would result in the same delay as the chain of MOSFETs. The authors of [13] also considered the power consumption of the gate.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Transistor sizing is a very effective way to improve the delay of a circuit. Earlier approaches for transistor sizing formulated the problem as that of minimizing the area of the circuit subject to certain delay constraint or optimizing the area-delay product <ref> [10, 4, 5, 16, 11, 7, 8, 15] </ref>. With improved process techniques and reduced feature sizes the constraint on area is becoming less strict; on the other hand, the growing market of low-power electronics is pushing the constraint of power consumption to the top of the stack of priorities.

Reference-contexts: If the power minimal layout satisfies the required delay, we have produced a layout with minimum power consumption and the algorithm returns. The algorithm, after detecting the critical paths using a technique similar to PERT <ref> [12] </ref>, size the transistors on the critical path to their power-delay optimal sizes (pd optimal size ()), from the gates driving primary outputs towards the primary inputs, reflecting the change in the load capacitance due to increase in transistor sizes.
