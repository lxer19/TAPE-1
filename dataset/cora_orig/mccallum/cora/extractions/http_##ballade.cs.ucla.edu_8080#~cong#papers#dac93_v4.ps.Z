Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient multilayer general area router, named V4R, for MCM and dense PCB designs. It uses no more than four vias to route every net and yet produces high quality routing solutions. It combines global routing and detailed routing in one step and produces high quality detailed routing solutions directly from the given netlist and module placement. As a result, V4R is independent of net ordering, runs much faster, and uses far less memory compared to other multilayer general area routers. Experimental results show that V4R outperforms both the 3D maze router and the SLICE router significantly.

Reference-contexts: nets so that it can be routed using at most 4 (k - 1) vias by V4R. high-performance MCMs, vias not only increase the manufacturing cost but also degrade the system performance since they form impedance discontinuities and cause reflections when the interconnections have to be modeled as transmission lines <ref> [Ba90] </ref>. Another unique feature of V4R is that it combines global routing and detailed routing in one step and produces high quality detailed routing solutions directly from the given net-list and module placement.

Reference-contexts: First, MCMs may have far more interconnection layers than ICs.

Moreover, unlike routing in ICs where the routing region can be naturally decomposed into channels and switchboxes, there is no natural routing hierarchy in MCM routing.

Reference-contexts: The use of maze router again slows down the computation and introduces extra vias. Several efficient routers have been proposed for silicon-on-silicon based MCM technology <ref> [PrPC89, DaDS91] </ref>. Since the number of routing layers is usually small (2 layers for signal routing in most cases) in this technology, many techniques for IC routing, such as hierarchical routing and rubber-band routing, can be applied to yield good solutions.

Few methods are available for multilayer MCM routing. A commonly used method for multilayer MCM designs is the three-dimensional (3D) maze routing <ref> [HaYY90, Mi91] </ref>. Although this method is conceptually simple to implement, it suffers from several problems. First, the quality of the maze routing solution is very sensitive to the ordering of the nets being routed, yet there is no effective algorithm for determining a good net ordering in general.

Reference-contexts: Another method for multilayer MCM routing is to divide the routing layers into several x -y layer pairs. Nets are first assigned to x -y layer pairs and then two-layer routing is carried out for each x -y layer pair <ref> [HoSV90] </ref>. Although this approach is efficient in general, it faces a few problems. First we have to pre-determine the number of the routing layers before we can carry out layer assignment, but there is no accurate estimation for the number of routing layers required.

Reference-contexts: the terminals in net i, and MST (i) is the wirelength of a minimum spanning tree connecting all the terminals in net i. (It is well known that the wirelength of a minimum spanning tree is no more than 1.5 times that of a minimum Steiner tree in Manhattan routing <ref> [Hw76] </ref>.) 6 There are many multi-terminal nets in mcc1. Among its 802 nets, 107 of them are multi-terminal nets of size 4 or larger. In this case, the lower bound is considerably smaller than the optimal wirelength.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, detailed routing information, such as constraints on via and segment locations, are not considered during the layer assignment stage, which may lead to poor detailed routing results. Recently, a multilayer MCM router named SLICE was developed by Khoo and Cong <ref> [KhCo92] </ref>. It computes a routing solution on a layer-by-layer basis and carries out planar routing in each layer. On average it uses 29% fewer vias and runs four times faster than the 3D maze router. <p> Based on these results and the efficient solution to the generalized maximum weighted non-crossing matching problem by Khoo and Cong in <ref> [KhCo92] </ref>, we have concluded that the horizontal track assignment of the left ter minals in column c can be carried out optimally in O (h c logh c ) time. 3.3.2.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we present an efficient multilayer general area router, named V4R, for MCM and dense PCB designs. One unique feature of V4R is that it uses no more than four vias to route every two-terminal net 2 and yet produces very satisfactory routing solutions. Marek-Sadowska <ref> [Ma84] </ref> showed a theoretical result that each two-terminal net can be routed using at most one via in a two-layer topological routing solution. <p> Although her result is interesting in theory, the resulting topological solution of one-via routing usually uses long wires and introduces congestion when mapped to a physical routing solution. Therefore, the method in <ref> [Ma84] </ref> is usually not applied directly in practice. To our knowledge, V4R is the first practical multilayer general area router that guarantees to use no more than a fixed number of vias for every net yet produces high quality physical routing solutions.
