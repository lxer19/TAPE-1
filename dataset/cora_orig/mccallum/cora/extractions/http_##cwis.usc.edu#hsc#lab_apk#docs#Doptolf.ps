Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION This note briefly describes an approach to optimal experiment design put forth in <ref> [1] </ref> which gets around the usual "catch-22" of having to know the true parameters in order to design an optimal experiment to find them. <p> Interestingly, it follows from this formulation that the optimal policy must by necessity use feedback and actively probe for information neither of which are properties inherent to conventional experiment design approaches. The method in <ref> [1] </ref> is specialized here to the E-Log-D-optimal criteria and is focused on finding optimal sampling times.
