Abstract: This paper reports on extensions that have been made to the DRESUN testbed for research on distributed situation assessment (DSA). These extensions involve issues that have arisen in modeling the beliefs of other agents when dealing with inter-agent communication of incomplete and conflicting evidence, and evidence at multiple levels of abstraction. The extensions support highly directed exchanges of evidence among agents because they better represent the uncertainties that occur when DRESUN agents exchange incomplete and conflicting information. This is important in FA/C systems because agents must share results in order to satisfy their local goals as well as the overall system goals. Thus, sharing must be done efficiently for an FA/C approach to be effective. These issues will arise in any distributed problem solving application involving interacting subproblems, when agents must function without complete and up-to-date information.
