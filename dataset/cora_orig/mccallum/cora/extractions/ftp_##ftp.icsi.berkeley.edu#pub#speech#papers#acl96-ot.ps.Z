Title: On Reversing the Generation Process in Optimality Theory

Abstract: Optimality Theory, a constraint-based phonology and morphology paradigm, has allowed linguists to make elegant analyses of many phenomena, including infixation and reduplication. In this work-in-progress, we build on the work of Ellison (1994) to investigate the possibility of using OT as a parsing tool that derives underlying forms from surface forms.

Reference-contexts: Infixation in Tagalog, however, has been modeled using OT (McCarthy and Prince, 1995). In Tagalog, the um affix can appear as a prefix, or "move" slightly into the word to which it is attaching <ref> (French, 1988) </ref>. Root with um Gloss alis um-alis "leave" sulat s-um-ulat "write" gradwet gr-um-adwet "graduate" McCarthy and Prince analyze um as a prefix, which moves into a word to reduce the number of coda consonants. They postulate two competing constraints, Align-prefix and the higher-ranked NoCoda.

Reference-contexts: There have, however, been no computational models of OT parsers that derive underlying forms from the surface form. 1 In this work, we lay the theoretical groundwork for using OT as a parsing tool. 2 Comparing Derivational Methods to Optimality Theory In traditional computational phonology/morphology systems such as two-level phonology <ref> (Koskenniemi, 1983) </ref>, grammars that generate surface forms are invertible, allowing parsing back into underlying forms. In a derivational framework, the grammar converts underlying forms to surface outputs via transformations; the input and output share the same space (Figure 1a).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Optimality Theory <ref> (Prince and Smolensky, 1993) </ref> is a constraint-based phonological and morphological system that allows violable constraints in deriving output surface forms from underlying forms. In OT a system of constraints selects an "optimal" surface output from a set of candidates.
