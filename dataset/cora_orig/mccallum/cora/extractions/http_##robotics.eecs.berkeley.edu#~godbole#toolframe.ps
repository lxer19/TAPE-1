Reference-contexts: Significant amongst these are simulation tools for system-level AHS simulation, technical analysis tools for safety, highway productivity, comfort, environmental impact, and cost, and design tools for vehicle, highway, communication, driver interface, and other technologies. We present a framework in which these tool needs can be discussed (see <ref> [1] </ref>). An AHS design consists of four specifications: vehicle design, infrastructure design, AHS operating rules, and failure events. An AHS is designed for deployment in an environment specified in terms of benchmark scenarios. The benchmark scenarios are given in terms of highway configuration, travel demand, weather conditions, and abnormal events.

Reference-contexts: In section 3 we describe some of these tools being developed by us based on the hybrid systems approach. 1.1 The PATH AHS Architecture The PATH Program at UC-Berkeley has proposed a hierarchical control architecture that yields up to four-fold increase in transportation capacity while enhancing safety <ref> [4, 3] </ref>. The architecture proposes a strategy of platooning several vehicles as they travel along the highway. The separation of vehicles within a platoon is small (2m) while separation of platoons from each other is large (60m).

Reference-contexts: In the PATH architecture, individual vehicle dynamics are governed by the hybrid control system formed by the interacting coordination and regulation layer controllers. Thus, collision analysis is equivalent to hybrid system verification. Although verification problems for general hybrid dynamical systems are undecidable, we are using optimal control techniques (see <ref> [8] </ref>) to get conservative guarantees and estimates of inter-vehicle collisions. 3.3 Productivity Analysis SmartCap is a link layer macro-simulator that performs numerical computation of the analytical activity flow model [9], an extension of traditional traffic flow models.

It permits differentiation of discrete activities such as entry, exit, merge, join, lane change, and cruise, performed by vehicles and it captures the impact of these activities on highway productivity.
