Reference-contexts: A detailed description of these methods is given in Section 3. The Jacobian matrix need not be evaluated explicitly at each iteration as two quasi-Newton update methods are also available: Broyden's (1965) method and a more recent method proposed by Lee and Lee <ref> (1989) </ref>. If the Jacobian matrix is to be evaluated explicitly there are two methods, namely a user-supplied analytical Jacobian or via finite differences. <p> for choosing how the Jacobian is updated): JACTYP=0 Analytical Jacobian provided JACTYP=1 Forward Difference Jacobian JACTYP=2 Backward Difference Jacobian JACTYP=3 Central Difference Jacobian 1 JUPDM Jacobian update method: JUPDM=0 Jacobian calculated at every iteration (either using analytical derivatives or finite differences) JUPDM=1 Broyden's (1965) quasi-Newton update JUPDM=2 Lee and Lee's <ref> (1989) </ref> quasi-Newton update 0 MAXEXP Maximum exponent allowed (base ten). <p> Stop if: This stopping tolerance governs step size before the line search; see STPTOL for the step size control after the step reduction via line search or trust region updating. e m OMEGA Factor [0,1] in Lee and Lee <ref> (1989) </ref> update. 0.1 RATIOF Comparison factor (0,1] in quasi-Newton methods. otherwise NFAIL remains unchanged. <p> However, it occasionally works better with bounded problems in that it has less tendency to get stuck at boundaries because the inaccuracies in the Jacobian result in search directions which don't pull toward the boundary as strongly. 6. The Lee and Lee <ref> (1989) </ref> quasi-Newton method is generally faster than Broyden's (1965) method although it does require extra O (n 2 ) operations internally; the choice for OMEGA does affect performance. There is little difference in robustness between the two. 7. <p> Kearfott (1990) has made an interval bisection method, INTBIS, available through NetLib. A third alternative are the ABS (Abaffy, Broyden and Spedicato) projection methods as advocated by Abaffy and Spedicato <ref> (1989) </ref>. At the time of writing, the solvers available from MINPACK, NAG and IMSL are based on the same principles as NNES so are unlikely to succeed where NNES fails. - 15 - 3. <p> Two such methods are available in NNES: the well-known Broyden's (1965) method and that of Lee and Lee <ref> (1989) </ref>. The compromise is that it usually takes more iterations (in some cases many more) to achieve convergence. When the function evaluations are simple it is faster to recalculate the Jacobian at each iteration; this is the choice of the default setup.

Reference-contexts: The Newton length is always greater, thus setting CAUCHY to TRUE is, generally, a more conservative and thus a slower approach. FALSE DEUFLH The initial line search relaxation factor, l, can be set to LAM0 or by a version of Deuflhard's <ref> (1974,1975) </ref> relaxation factor initialization process which estimates what the relaxation factor should be at each iteration. LAM0 is usually 1.0 but may be made smaller if the problem is extremely nonlinear. TRUE GEOMS Two types of search may be used to reduce either l or d. <p> NNES allows three important variations from this general setup: a nonmonotonic extension of the Armijo criterion as proposed by Grippo, Lampariello and Lucidi (1986) has been added; the initial relaxation factor in each line search, l 0 , can be estimated using a variation of the method given by Deuflhard <ref> (1974,1975) </ref> and a second objective function can be used. These three extensions are described below. The nonmonotonic extension entails comparing the objective function at the trial point to the maximum of a user-selected number (MGLL in NNES) of previous trial points. <p> There are other mechanisms such as boundaries, setting MAXSTP, switching to trust region methods and using OVERFL in the function vector which are better ways to avoid such problems. The second method, devised by Deuflhard <ref> (1974, 1975) </ref>, relies on calculating a vector, designated as `s in NNES, using the Jacobian from the previous point and the new function vector: and then defining fi k by - 20 - so, finally, l 0 at iteration k is estimated by (18) Since the original version of Deuflhard's initialization <p> Deuflhard <ref> (1974, 1975) </ref> also proposed a second step acceptance criterion, known as the natural objective function, based on s`.

Reference-contexts: If no solution has been found yet, it is unlikely that NNES will be able to find it. There are other methods available such as true continuation methods. Several are available through NetLib. General references are the books by Garcia and Zangwill <ref> (1981) </ref>, Morgan (1987) and Allgower and Georg (1990). The last two have FORTRAN code included. Also, Shacham (1986) lists the FORTRAN source code for his simple continuation method.
