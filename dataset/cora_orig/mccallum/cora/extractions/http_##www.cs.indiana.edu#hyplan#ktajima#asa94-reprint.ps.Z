Abstract: This study investigates the contribution of the temporal patterning of speech to the reduced intelligibility of foreign-accented utterances. Short English phrases spoken by a native Chinese speaker were instrumentally modified, using LPC resynthesis and dynamic time warping, so as to align the duration of acoustic segments with tokens of the same phrases spoken by a native English speaker, while retaining the spectral and source characteristics of the Chinese speaker. Similarly, the native speaker's productions were distorted to match the durational patterns of the nonnative speaker. Intelligibility of these stimuli was measured based on native English listeners' performance in a forced-choice identification test with four alternatives: the correct phrase plus three phonetically similar distractor phrases suggested by listening to the Chinese productions. Intelligibility of the unmodified Chinese-accented phrases was poor (39% correct), but improved significantly (to 58%) after temporal correction. Performance on the native productions was high (94%), but declined significantly (to 83%) after temporal distortion according to the Chinese speaker's timing. These results suggest that intelligibility of foreign-language speakers may be enhanced if explicit training is provided on temporal properties of their speech.

Reference-contexts: Short English phrases were produced by a Chinese speaker of English and a native English speaker. Chinese was selected partly because of the large structural differences between Chinese and English (Cheng, 1966). Using objective methods involving LPC-based speech coding and resynthesis <ref> (e.g. Atal and Hanauer, 1971) </ref> along with dynamic time warping (e.g. Rabiner, Rosenberg, and Levinson, 1978), the Chinese speaker's productions were temporally modified so that the duration of acoustic segments matched the duration of corresponding segments in the native speaker's productions.

Reference-contexts: Many of these errors were also consistent with a tendency to avoid producing consonant clusters through either vowel epenthesis (e.g. phrase F, "foreign market") or consonant deletion (e.g. phrase A, "briefest outline") <ref> (cf. Tarone, 1980) </ref>. Locating these phrases in Figure 4 (a), it is evident that these phrases were generally associated with more positive changes in intelligibility than phrases which did not involve such "discrete" modifications (i.e. phrases B, C, D, and H).
