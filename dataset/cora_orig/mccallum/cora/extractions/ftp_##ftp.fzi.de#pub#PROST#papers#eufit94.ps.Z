Title: Fuzzy Exploration of an Unknown Environment

Abstract: We present a novel approach to the well known problem to have an autonomous mobile robot explore its environment. Due to the kinematic model and the very simple sensors employed we are faced with a lot of considerable uncertainties. By consequently and systematically exploiting the fuzzy nature of the data involved we obtain very convincing results. From our point of view our system is yet another argument endorsing the extensive use of intelligible, i.e. transparent mechanisms dealing with fuzziness.
