Title: PARALLEL STABLE COMPACTIFICATION FOR ODE WITH PARAMETERS AND MULTIPOINT CONDITIONS  
Author: R. M. M. MATTHEIJ S. J. WRIGHT 
Date: June 30, 1993  
Abstract: Many algorithms for solving ordinary differential equations with parameters and multipoint side conditions give rise to systems of linear algebraic equations in which the coefficient matrices have a bordered block diagonal structure. In this paper, we show how these problems can be solved by using parallel algorithms based on stabilized compactification.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that the potential switch points o k (from which the fi k are chosen) are known before hand, while the ff k may be anywhere in the interval (a; b). 3 The Basic Algorithm The "stabilized compactification" algorithm has been described in Ascher, Mattheij, and Russell <ref> [1, pp. 157-161] </ref>. In this section, we outline a parallel version and discuss some aspects of its implementation in a message-passing computational environment.

For purposes of efficiency, it is usually best to use the original form when solving such problems. Each of these problem categories has a corresponding "discrete" form, in which the differential equation is replaced by a difference equation.

Reference-contexts: Correspondingly, a row is dropped from the first part of i during the backward sweep. This is essentially the strategy used by de Hoog and Mattheij <ref> [4, x4] </ref>. A circumstance that causes more immediate failure of the algorithm occurs when the submatrix [A i B i ] fails to have full rank for some i.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, solution of the reduced system is such a small part of the overall computation that near-perfect speedup is attained. Our second example arises from transport theory. Consider the single-group one-dimensional transport equation as defined by Jin and Levermore <ref> [7, Example 2] </ref>: @ x (x; ) + oe T (x)(x; ) = 1 Z 1 (x; 0 ) d 0 ; x 2 (0; L); (57) STABLE PARALLEL COMPACTIFICATION FOR ODEs 22 Table 3: Example 1, four processors, N = 4000. <p> ! i &gt; 0 leads to the approximation Z 1 f () d i=1 Using the notation i (x) = (x; i ); and discretizing the boundary conditions in an obvious (though not optimal) way, we can write the boundary value problem arising from Example 2 of Jin and Levermore <ref> [7] </ref> as i 0 2 w (x)oe T (x) j=1 i (0) = 5; i = 1 2 n: (60) Because of separation of the boundary conditions and the well-posed nature of this problem, we would expect exactly half of the fundamental modes to be nonincreasing and half to be nondecreasing

Reference-contexts: Proof. We assume throughout the proof that k:k denotes the Euclidean norm k:k 2 . Our result depends on standard analysis for Householder QR factorizations (Lawson and Hanson, <ref> [8, pp. 86-89] </ref>) and LU factorizations (Golub and Van Loan [6, x3.3]). The key to the stability argument is the fact that element growth in the L and U factors of P L QARP R is bounded, because of (i). <p> First, we take account of the errors arising from the initial orthogonal transformation. By the argument of Lawson and Hanson <ref> [8, p. 87] </ref>, we have that if C 2 Rl nfin is a general matrix and Q 2 Rl nfin is a product of n Householder transformations, then comp (QC) = Q (C + H); where comp (:) denotes the computed value of its argument, taking roundoff error into account, and

Reference-contexts: Mattheij <ref> [9, p. 329] </ref> describes a heuristic that, applied to the present situation, would find R k j +1 so that the diagonal elements of V 1 i U i (namely, (U i ) ll =(V i ) ll , l = 1; ; n) appear in descending order for most i <p> Otherwise, we require the lower right ` fi ` submatrix (V i ) 22 of V i to dominate the corresponding submatrix (U i ) 22 of U i . For "close calls," we can use the test suggested in <ref> [9] </ref>: If the quantity p X k j+1 1 X log U i ll i (j) j i is negative, the l-th diagonal element is included in the (2; 2) partition. In a multiprocessor setting, the formation of this "global" sum requires interprocesssor communication.

Reference-contexts: To make the discussion in subsequent sections clearer, we group the problems to be addressed into three categories: Two-point boundary value problems: _x = A (t)x + c (t); t 2 [a; b]; (1) Parametrized problems with multipoint conditions (see, for example, soluton formulations discussed in Rinzel and Terman <ref> [11] </ref>): _x = A (t)x + C (t) + c (t); t 2 [a; b]; (2) j=1 M i x (o j ) + N = d; a o 1 o p b; Parameter identification problems (see, for example, chemical rate constant identification as in Bock [3]): min j=1 kM j

Reference-contexts: In x3, a parallel algorithm for (4) is described and is contrasted with previously proposed algorithms (e.g., Wright <ref> [13, 12] </ref>). This algorithm is extended to problems of the form (5) and (6) in x5. Finally, some numerical results are presented in x6. 2 Conditioning of the Problem and Structure of the Solution Spaces The various problems defined in x1 relate to solution spaces of potentially different types. <p> The extra columns in the shooting matrix that are due to the presence of parameters are handled as described in Wright <ref> [12, x5] </ref>. Each processor compresses its "slice" of the shooting matrix into a single block row, leaving a reduced system with (p + 1)n + m rows and columns. This system is solved by using a "cyclic reduction" variant of SQR, which we now briefly describe.
