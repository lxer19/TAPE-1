Reference-contexts: Java Virtual Machine [Meyer and Downing, 1997] provides an informal, but less authoritative, introduction to the JVM. Access to The Java Language Specification [Gosling et al., 1996] may also be useful. The Java Language <ref> [Arnold and Gosling, 1996] </ref> provides a good introduction to the Java language. 2.1 The dJVM as a State Machine The dJVM state consists of a set of class declarations, a set of objects (instances of classes), a call stack, and a status flag.
