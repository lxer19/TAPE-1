Title: Users' Guide to mpich, a Portable Implementation of MPI  
Author: Patrick Bridges Nathan Doss William Gropp Edward Karrels Ewing Lusk Anthony Skjellum 
Date: July 31, 1995  
Abstract: MPI (Message-Passing Interface) is a standard specification for message-passing libraries. mpich is a portable implementation of the full MPI specification for a wide variety of parallel computing environments. This paper describes how to build and run MPI programs using the MPICH implementation of MPI.

Reference-contexts: One that we use is called Upshot, which is a derivative of Upshot [5], written in Tcl/Tk. A screen dump of Upshot in use is shown in Figure 1. It shows parallel time lines with process states, like one of the paraGraph <ref> [4] </ref>. The view can be zoomed in or out, horizontally or vertically, centered on any point in the display chosen with the mouse. In Figure 1, the middle window has resulted from zooming in on the upper window at a chosen point to show more detail.

Reference-contexts: During execution, MPI Pcontrol can be used to suspend and restart logging operations. The logfile produced at the end can be analyzed by a variety of tools. One that we use is called Upshot, which is a derivative of Upshot <ref> [5] </ref>, written in Tcl/Tk. A screen dump of Upshot in use is shown in Figure 1.

To go with mpich it has been completely rewritten by Ed Karrels to provide more robustness and flexibility. The current version resides in the directory profiling/upshot, and there is a symbolic link to the executable in mpich/bin.
