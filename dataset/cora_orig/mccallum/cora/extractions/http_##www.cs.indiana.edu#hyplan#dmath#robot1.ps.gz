Abstract: Recently, Mathias introduced a model of teaching that allows a high degree of interaction between the teacher and learner [13]. The stated goal of that model (indeed of any model of teaching) is to model accurately learning scenarios in which the objective of the environment is to help the learner accomplish its learning task as efficiently as possible. While it is important to develop such models to enhance understanding of learning problems and their tractability, it is crucial that we not neglect the utility of models of teaching and learning for solving "real-world" problems. Therefore, we present in this paper the results of several experiments devised to gauge the relevance of our interactive teaching model to a realistic learning domain. Specifically, we present results obtained using a simulator we developed for the problem of robotic terrain acquisition. The simulator is described in Section 4. The empirical results in this paper should be viewed as preliminary evidence that helpful teachers, with no extraordinary powers, can positively impact learning efficiency.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm they present achieves a competitive ratio of O (k). Kalyanasundaram and Pruhs [8] show a lower bound of (min (k; p kff)) for terrain acquisition in the presence of convex obstacles, where ff is the average aspect ratio of the k obstacles. Finally, Awerbuch et al. <ref> [1] </ref> consider terrain acquisition with the restriction that the robot must occasionally return to some "home base" for refueling. Representing the domain as graph G = (V; E), they give an algorithm that traverses O (jEj + jV j 1+o (1) ) edges, achieving nearly linear time.

Reference-contexts: For the navigation problem Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [15] first showed that the competitive ratio for 2 dimensional space, when all obstacles are squares, is at least 1:5 and at most 1:5 + o (1). Blum, Raghavan and Schieber <ref> [3] </ref> formulate a variant of the navigation problem, known as the room problem, in which the learner's goal is to navigate from a corner of a square room to the center of the room in the presence of obstacles.

They also give an algorithm for a rectilinear room with rectilinear obstacles. Let k be the number of obstacles in the room.

Reference-contexts: The terrain acquisition problem is considered by Rao et al. [19] for 2 and 3 dimensions under the framework described above. Lumelsky et al. <ref> [11] </ref> consider this problem for robots with continuous vision sensors. They develop two distinct models. <p> Finally, in the third mode the robot make no decisions on its own. It simply does what the teacher tells it to do. The algorithm used by the robot, when acting autonomously, is a modified version of the sightseer algorithm <ref> [11] </ref>. In that algorithm the robot repeatedly walks to the nearest unvisited obstacle and completely circumnavigates it. Every obstacle is circumnavigated at most once. We have modified this algorithm in the following ways.

Reference-contexts: This algorithm repeatedly calculates a spur | a region hidden by obstacles. After each spur is computed it is explored and a new spur is computed. This continues until the destination is visible. More recently, Lumelsky and Skewis <ref> [12] </ref> gave an algorithm for the case of obstacles defined by closed curves. Considering discrete vision sensors, Rao [17, 18] and Rao et al. [20] have provided geometric frameworks within which this problem can be considered (they use a finite graph representation).

In this paper we present empirical evidence that models of teaching can be useful with respect to "real-world" problems. Specifically, we consider the interactive teaching model of Mathias <ref> [13] </ref>. In this model, the teacher and learner have on-going interaction as opposed to the batch communication in previous teaching models. We consider the following learning problem. A robot with vision sensors must autonomously navigate some terrain (i.e. a warehouse).

Reference-contexts: These figures are roughly 50% greater than autonomous operation and more than 300% greater than when interacting with a helpful teacher. A weak upper bound on the number of destination points that the teacher must supply is provided by one of the art gallery theorems <ref> [14] </ref>. The general art gallery problem is: given a polygon, how many guards are necessary to guard the polygon? That is, what is the minimum number of points from which the entire polygon (interior and boundary) can bee seen? Guards are assumed to have 360 ffi vision. <p> Let s be the number of obstacles and n the number of vertices in the environment. Aggarwal has shown that dn=4e + 1 vertex guards are sufficient to see the exterior of a rectilinear polygon on n vertices (see O'Rourke <ref> [14] </ref>, page 149). From this we can easily derive a bound on the number of guards that are sufficient to see the exterior of s rectilinear obstacles. Let G represent the number of guards and n i represent the number of vertices in obstacle i. <p> In addition, the destination points (analogous to a guard point) are not restricted to be vertices. It is conjectured that bn=4c point guards (not necessarily on vertices) are sufficient to guard any number of rectilinear obstacles <ref> [14] </ref>. In our experiments, in every case the number of queries used is much less than the derived upper bound. In all cases but one the number of queries used is less than the conjectured bound.

Reference-contexts: However, there has been considerable work on algorithms that give performance guarantees, typically in the form of the ratio of actual path length to optimal, off-line path length, known as the competitive ratio. For the navigation problem Papadimitriou and Yannakakis <ref> [15] </ref> first showed that the competitive ratio for 2 dimensional space, when all obstacles are squares, is at least 1:5 and at most 1:5 + o (1).

We first summarize results for robots (again, these are theoretical results; no actual robots were used) using vision sensors for the navigation problem. The first algorithm using continuous vision sensing for this problem is due to Sutherland [21].
