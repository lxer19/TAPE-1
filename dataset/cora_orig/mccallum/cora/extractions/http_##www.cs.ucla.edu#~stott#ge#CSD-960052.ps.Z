Abstract: Recently we have reported on new LU factorization and block matrix methods that use randomized linear preconditioning in place of dynamic strategies such as partial and pairwise pivoting. We elaborate on the theory underlying these a priori methods, and apply it to several examples, including a new method for the calculation of Moore-Penrose pseudoinverses.
