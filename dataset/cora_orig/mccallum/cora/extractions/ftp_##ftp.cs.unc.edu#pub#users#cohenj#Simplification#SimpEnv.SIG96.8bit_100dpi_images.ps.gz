Abstract: We propose the idea of simplification envelopes for generating a hierarchy of level-of-detail approximations for a given polygonal model. Our approach guarantees that all points of an approximation are within a user-specifiable distance * from the original model and that all points of the original model are within a distance * from the approximation. Simplification envelopes provide a general framework within which a large collection of existing simplification algorithms can run. We demonstrate this technique in conjunction with two algorithms, one local, the other global. The local algorithm provides a fast method for generating approximations to large input meshes (at least hundreds of thousands of triangles). The global algorithm provides the opportunity to avoid local minima and possibly achieve better simplifications as a result. Each approximation attempts to minimize the total number of polygons required to satisfy the above * constraint. The key advantages of our approach are:

Reference-contexts: This wavelet approach preserves global topology. In computational geometry, it has been shown that computing the minimal-facet *-approximation is NP-hard for both convex polytopes [5] and polyhedral terrains <ref> [1] </ref>. Thus, algorithms to solve these problems have evolved around finding polynomial-time approximations that are close to the optimal. Let k o be the size of a min-# approximation. <p> In [2] Bronnimann and Goodrich observed that a variant of Clarkson's algorithm yields a polynomial-time deterministic algorithm that computes an approximation of size O (k 0 ). Working with polyhedral terrains, <ref> [1] </ref> present a polynomial-time algorithm that computes an *-approximation of size O (k o log k o ) to a polyhedral terrain. Our work is different from the above in that it allows adaptive, genus-preserving, *-approximation of arbitrary polygonal objects. Additionally, we can simplify bordered meshes and meshes with holes.

Reference-contexts: Let k o be the size of a min-# approximation. An algorithm has been given in [16] for computing an *- approximation of size O (k o log n) for convex polytopes. This has recently been improved by Clarkson in <ref> [3] </ref>; he proposes a randomized algorithm for computing an approx imation of size O (k o log k o ) in expected time O (k o n 1+ffi ) for any ffi &gt; 0 (the constant of proportionality depends on ffi, and tends to +1 as ffi tends to 0). <p> This sort of confirmation reassures us that the single-pass heuristic works well in practice. 5.3 Global Algorithm This algorithm extends the algorithm presented in <ref> [3] </ref> to non-convex surfaces. Our major contribution is the use of simplification envelopes to bound the error on a non-convex polygonal surface and the use of fundamental prisms to provide a generalized projection mechanism for testing for regions of multiple covering (overlaps).

For the same error bound, we are able to obtain much improved solutions. We have automated the process which sets the * value for each object by assigning it to be a percentage of the diagonal of its bounding box.
