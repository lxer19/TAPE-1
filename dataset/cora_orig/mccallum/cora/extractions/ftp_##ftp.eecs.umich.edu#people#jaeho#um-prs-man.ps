Reference-contexts: A demo system, including of all of the necessary components for a complete, running system, is included with the UM-PRS package. The UM-PRS execution cycle is very similar to that originally discussed for PRS in <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4, 6] </ref>. Changes to the world model or posting of new goals triggers the system to search for all valid (based upon the goal and context) KAs that might be used to deal with the situation.
