Title: Packet Filtering in an IP Router  
Author: Bruce Corbridge, Robert Henig, Charles Slater Telebit Corporation 
Abstract: By using existing information in packet headers, routers can provide system administrators a facility to manage network connections between computers. Host address, network number, interface, direction, protocol, and port number are parameters that may be used to implement an access control policy. We present experiences developing the packet filtering facility in the NetBlazer dial-up IP router. We address the sometimes conflicting design goals of efficient performance and ease of administration by choosing internal data structures that simplify per packet lookup and then devoting 90 per cent of our code to implementing commands that maintain these tables in manner that is easy for system administrators.

Reference-contexts: The command displays the results of input filter, routing, and output filter table lookup. Lookup Order Traditionally, a 32-bit IP address has been considered to have three components: network, subnet, and host <ref> [1] </ref>. Phil Karn's ka9q views an IP address simply as network and host with the network portion being of a variable length that is defined by the sub-net mask [7]. Routing lookup is done by searching the network numbers with the longest subnet masks first.

Reference-contexts: Broadcast packets, packets for which the router does not have a route, packets with bad IP headers, and packets that have been bouncing around over too many gateways (packets with TTL = 0) are not forwarded <ref> [2] </ref>. Routers from several manufacturers can use IP source and destination address to provide administrative control of which hosts or networks may communicate with each other. Some also use UDP or TCP port or ICMP message type to control what applications network connections are used for [4, 14, 15].

Reference-contexts: The syntax for the configuration language is specified with a BNF and implemented using lex and yacc. Screend uses a cache of recently used packet descriptions and decisions to reduce lookup time. Application-Layer Proxy In the application-layer gateway used at AT&T Bell Laboratories described by Cheswick <ref> [6] </ref>, two specialized machines are used: inet and r70. Only inet is visible to the outside world. It contains a very limited amount of secret information.

Reference-contexts: Packet Filtering Gateway and Authentication Server Several sites use a combination of a packet filtering gateway and an authentication server to secure an internet connection. The MITRE Corporation uses a cisco router to limit the number of hosts exposed to the Internet <ref> [8] </ref>. Applications such as telnet, rlogin, and ftp have been modified to use a SecureID smartcard system. Connections from the Internet are validated with a challenge/response system.

Reference-contexts: In principle, the routing table could be used to decide to which destinations packets may be routed and to which they may not. This solution is secure if only static routes are used. Commonly used routing protocols such as RIP are not secure <ref> [9] </ref>. Some routers can choose from which source address they will accept RIP information [4, 11]. This helps secure against acquisition of incorrect routing information that was accidentally provided.

Reference-contexts: Input filter lookup is done first then routing table lookup, then output table lookup. The most significant network number (the ones with the most bits) are searched first.

Reference-contexts: The other is an application-layer gateway that provides proxy access to the Internet. A third technique uses a combination of a packet filtering gateway and an authentication server. Packet Filtering Gateway Digital Equipment Corporation's screend is packet filter that runs as a UNIX process <ref> [13] </ref>. Packets are filtered on input. The decision to accept or deny a packet may be based on host address, sub-net or application (port or ICMP type code). Screend supports one-way or bi-directional filters, source or destination addresses, and wildcards (accept any value). Figure 1 shows examples of filter specifications. <p> Source routed packets may slip through a filtering router by appearing to be destined for an authorized host and then being forwarded to an unauthorized host. Screend solves this problem by not routing source routed packets <ref> [13] </ref>. Except for the first one, fragments of a packet do not contain the next level protocol information needed to do port filtering. Passing subsequent fragments is relatively harmless since it is difficult to compromise a system without sending it complete packets. <p> One-line Commands Other implementations use configuration languages to create a filter configuration file. In these implementations, rules are applied to packets in the order in which they were entered <ref> [4, 13] </ref>. We wanted administrators to be able to update the filter table with one-line commands in much the same way that they update the routing table and we wanted the search process to be order of entry independent.
