Harter. </author> <title> Teleporting Making Applications Mobile. </title> <booktitle> In Proceedings of 1994 Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications, </booktitle> <address> Santa Cruz, </address> <month> December </month> <year> 1994. </year> <month> 9 </month>
Reference-contexts: These applications and systems use SPIRIT for personalisation and adaptation as they can share some of the users' perception of the environment. 3.3.1 The Teleporting System The Teleporting System <ref> [Richardson 95, BRH 94] </ref> is a tool for experiencing an alternative approach to mobile computing in which application interfaces, rather than the computer on which the applications run, are able to move.

Reference-contexts: We rely Ora 4 cle7 for managing concurrency control, locking, transaction processing, query optimisa-tions, indexing and so on. The database maintenance packages are implemented using PL/SQL <ref> [Feuerstein 95] </ref> which is Oracle's procedural extension to SQL combining data manipulation and transaction processing capabilities of SQL with procedural programming constructs. Spatial queries and monitoring are supported by a dedicated spatial indexing system which communicates via shared memory with the Oracle database.

Reference-contexts: The main system currently deployed is the infra-red based Active Badge system. This will be augmented in the next 2 year by a finer-grained ultrasound-based system. These sensors provide the main source of location information for the database. 3.2.1 Active Badges The Active Badge System 1 <ref> [HH 94] </ref> provides a means of locating individuals within a building by determining the location of their active badge. This is a small device which is worn by personnel; it transmits a unique infra-red signal every 10 seconds.

Reference-contexts: This approach has been adopted by the MIND project <ref> [Kilic 95] </ref> which is a system that uses CORBA implementation in developing a multidatabse system.

Mapp. </author> <title> Integrating Multimedia Streams into a Distributed Computing System. </title> <booktitle> In Proceedings of Multimedia Computing and Networking, </booktitle> <address> San Jose, CA, USA, </address> <month> January </month> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: C. Olivetti & C., S.p.A 3 For teleporting suitable displays must be specified according to the current location of the user. Such information can be drawn from SPIRIT. 3.3.2 Mobile Multimedia Streams The goal of the mobile multimedia streams project <ref> [MM 96] </ref> is to integrate continuous media, such as audio and video, into a mobile adaptive, distributed computing environment. The major sense of mobile relates to the mobility of the user.

Reference-contexts: This is the data which cannot be reported by telemetry. SPIRIT communicates with its sources of information as well as its application clients via CORBA interfaces. CORBA (The Common Object Request Broker Architecture) which 5 is developed by the Object Management Group OMG <ref> [OMG 91] </ref> is a specification and an ar-chitecture that provides an implementation independent access to objects on heterogeneous systems.
Reference: [OMG 95] <institution> Object Management Group, Object Property Service, OMG document Number 95.6.1, </institution> <month> June, </month> <year> 1995. </year>
Reference-contexts: Although this approach is easy to implement, it requires all 6 end users to be expert in SQL and to be aware of the details of the data model and schemas which is not practical. * Using the CORBA Object Property Service The Property Service <ref> [OMG 95] </ref> is a standard CORBA 2.0 service that allows users to associate a PropertySet to an object then add, update or delete properties to this PropertySet dynamically. Using OPS, one can provide functions that gather related attributes together in a PropertySet and returns a handle to the PropertySet.
Reference: [Oracle 92] <institution> Oracle7 Server Concepts Manual, Oracle Corporation, </institution> <month> December, </month> <year> 1992. </year>
Reference-contexts: An overview of the architecture of SPIRIT is shown in Figure 1. It is based around an Oracle7 <ref> [Oracle 92] </ref> database which stores all the relevant information describing hardware and software resources as well as people. We rely Ora 4 cle7 for managing concurrency control, locking, transaction processing, query optimisa-tions, indexing and so on.
Reference: [Oracle 93] <institution> Progammer's guide to the Oracle Pro*C Precompiler, Oracle Corporation, </institution> <month> December, </month> <year> 1993. </year>
Reference-contexts: This approach seemed to be the most suitable and was the one adopted. An example of a portion of an IDL interface is given in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 3, the database server consists of a CORBA server written in Pro*C/C++ <ref> [Oracle 93] </ref> using embedded SQL to implement the specified functions. The CORBA server can access the database directly using SQL commands or call one or more of the stored PL/SQL procedures or functions. A set of CORBA interfaces are provided for the clients, one for each resource. * Sedona.

Reference-contexts: These applications and systems use SPIRIT for personalisation and adaptation as they can share some of the users' perception of the environment. 3.3.1 The Teleporting System The Teleporting System <ref> [Richardson 95, BRH 94] </ref> is a tool for experiencing an alternative approach to mobile computing in which application interfaces, rather than the computer on which the applications run, are able to move.
