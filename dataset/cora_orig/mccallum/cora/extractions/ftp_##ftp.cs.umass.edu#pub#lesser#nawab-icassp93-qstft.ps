Title: EFFICIENT STFT APPROXIMATION USING A QUANTIZATION AND DIFFERENCING METHOD  
Author: S.Hamid Nawab, Erkan Dorken 
Affiliation: ECS Department, Boston University  
Abstract: We introduce a novel class of algorithms for efficiently computing approximations to the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) of any given signal. These algorithms may be classified in accordance with the number of quantization levels they use to represent the values in each short-time frame of the input signal. The structure and properties of these algorithms are illustrated in this paper through a specific case which uses a 3-level quantization in each frame. We also present results obtained by applying an implementation of the 3-level algorithm to musical and speech signals. The resulting approximations conform to theoretical expectations of 9dB SNR in the STFT approximations. However, these approximations are found to require an order of magnitude less computation than FFT-based algorithms for the exact STFT.

In such applications, real-time performance may be obtained by substituting the exact STFT with an approximate but highly efficient STFT. We have developed a class of such algorithms which produce approximations to the STFT with a quality that allows the identification of salient signal features for various practical applications.
