Reference-contexts: Experimental Results The 512 fi 512 images "goldhill" and "lena", with various noise level = 5; 10; 15; 20, are used as test data. The chosen wavelet is Daubechies' least asymmetric compactly-supported wavelet with 8 vanishing moments <ref> [4] </ref>, and 4 scales of decomposition are used. Firstly, to show that the thresholded coefficients are nearly Laplacian, the Q-Q plot of the HL 1 subband of goldhill is shown in Figure 8.

When there is a rate or distortion constraint, the constraint problem can be formulated into a minimization problem with a Lagrange multiplier, D + R. <p> When there is a rate or distortion constraint, the constraint problem can be formulated into a minimization problem with a Lagrange multiplier, D + R.

Natarajan [14] and Liu and Moulin <ref> [11] </ref> both proposed to use compression for denoising, with the former operating at a constrained distortion, D 2 , and the latter operating at = 1 2 2 ln 2 on the R-D curve. Both works recommend the use of any reasonable coder.

Reference-contexts: Typically, these two criteria are conflicting requirements. In order to reach a compromise, there needs to be a criterion for selecting the most suitable outcome. Rissanen's Minimum Description Length principle serves exactly this purpose <ref> [15] </ref>. A. Original MDL Criterion Let M be a library or class of models from which we will choose the "best" one to represent the data. <p> This term can be viewed as the ideal code-length for coding u at precision ffi. With the value ffi fixed, log p (u) is called the idealized code-length. Rissanen <ref> [15] </ref> showed that the optimal ffi is on the order of 1= p N for parametric models. Let us now state the MDL principle. Given the set of observations Y , we wish to find a model ^ X to describe it.

Reference-contexts: II, the (non-zero) thresholded coefficients ^ X = T (Y ) can be seen to be close to Laplacian distributed (see the text in Section IV and Laplacian random variables has been well-studied and the design of the entropy-constrained scalar quantizer (ECSQ) for a Laplacian distribution is discussed by Sullivan <ref> [21] </ref>. Furthermore, it was shown that the uniform threshold quantizer (UTQ) achieves nearly the performance of the ECSQ, and has the additional benefit of being simple to design.
