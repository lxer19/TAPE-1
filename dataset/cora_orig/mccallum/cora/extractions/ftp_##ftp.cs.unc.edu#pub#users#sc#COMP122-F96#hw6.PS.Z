Abstract: Problems to hand in H-1 An undirected graph G = (V; E) is said to be planar if it can be drawn on a sheet of paper without any of the edges intersecting. More formally, G is planar if and only if there exists a mapping of the vertices and edges of the graph into the plane such that each vertex is mapped into a distinct point, each edge (v; w) is mapped onto a simple curve, with the vertices v and w mapped onto the endpoints of the curve, and mappings of distinct edges have only the mappings of their common endpoints in common. A face of a planar graph is a region of the plane enclosed by the graph. The outside region is counted as a face. The graph shown below has 11 vertices, 19 edges, and 10 faces.
