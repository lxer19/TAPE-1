Abstract: We study the asymptotic form as p ! 1 of the Daubechies orthogonal minimum phase filter h p [n], scaling function p (t) and wavelet w p (t). Kateb-Lemarie calculated the leading term in the phase of the frequency response H p (!). The infinite product b p (!) = H p (!=2 k ) leads us to a problem in stationary phase, for an oscillatory integral with parameter t. The leading terms change form with t = t=p and we find tt 1 sin[p(G (1) () t )] + o(p 1 ) The numbers t 0 ' :1817 and t 1 ' :3515 are known constants. The function G and its integral G (1) are independent of p . Regions 1 and 2 are matched over the interval p 2=3 t t t 0 t 1. The wavelets have a simpler asymptotic expression because the Airy wavefront is removed by the highpass filter. We also find the asymptotics of the impulse response h p [n] | a different function g(!) controls the three regions.

Reference-contexts: We note an important difference in the time scale t=p, compared to the asymptotics of B-splines (see Unser et. al. <ref> [4] </ref>). The splines are symmetric. They approach Gaussians with scaling t= p p. The spline wavelets approach cosine-modulated Gaussians on that scale too. The central limit theorem is at work. Our problem requires a further step, and the technical tool will be the method of stationary phase.

Reference-contexts: Therefore it is energy insignif icant. In one word, the energy of the impulse response h p [n] is asymptotically concentrated on the interval n 2 [t h 0 p; t h 1 p]. Our analysis of these coefficients began with Nico Temme's plot of h 100 [n] in <ref> [10] </ref>, which is reproduced in Figure 6. In this case p = 100, and the leading order is log 10 100 = 1.
