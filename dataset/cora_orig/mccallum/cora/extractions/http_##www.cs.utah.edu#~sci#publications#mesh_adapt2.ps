Abstract: In this paper we present an adaptive method for the solution of large scale forward and inverse problems occurring in biomedicine. Specifically, we describe models based on magnetic resonance images of the human thorax that are used to solve electric and potential field imaging problems. We introduce two- and three-dimensional nonuniform spatial mesh adaptation schemes based upon a posteriori error estimates from the finite element approximation, an algorithm that utilizes a minimax theorem based on estimates of the electric and potential fields and a three-dimensional, Delaunay triangulation program. Initial results are presented for two- and three-dimensional models.

For all of the problems stated above, the ability to obtain accurate solutions depends on how well we can describe the geometry and conductivity values and control numerical errors, which occur in part because of the inadequate treatment of large potential gradients.

For problems in which experimental validation is difficult (or 14 impossible) and the effects of errors are potentially catastrophic, as is frequently the case in medicine, confidence in the simulation results is crucial. Adaptive methods present an appealing way to decrease errors due to discretization and thus increase accuracy.
