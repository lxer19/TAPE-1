Title: Unlinkable Serial Transactions

Abstract: We present a protocol for unlinkable serial transactions suitable for a variety of network-based subscription services. The protocol prevents the service from tracking the behavior of its customers while protecting the service vendor from abuse due to simultaneous or "cloned" usage from a single subscription. We present variants of the protocol supporting pay-per-use transactions within a subscription. We describe other applications including third-party subscription management, multiven dor package sales, proof of group membership, and voter registration.

Reference-contexts: User's worried about traffic analysis can use Babel [12] or other Mixmaster [8] based remailers which forward messages through a series of Chaum mixes [4]. Each mix can identify only the previous and next mix, and never (both) the sender and recipient. For Web browsing, the Anonymizer <ref> [1] </ref> provides a degree of protection. Web connections made through the Anonymizer are anonymized. By looking at connection information, packet headers, etc. the destination Web server can only identify that the connection came from (through) the Anonymizer. 4 Paul F. Syverson, Stuart G.

Reference-contexts: As long as the customer does not double spend, his identity is protected. Nobody but the customer can generate responses, so the customer cannot be framed for double spending. It may be the case that truly anonymous unlinkable e-cash enables criminal activity. Several key escrow or trustee-based systems <ref> [2] </ref> have been developed that can reveal identities to authorities who obtain proper authorizations. Our notion of unlinkable certificates came from asking the following question: what else shares some of the features of digital cash? Unlinkable certifi 3 Paul F. Syverson, Stuart G.

Reference-contexts: How do we guarantee that the client pays the vendor for the pay-per-use transaction? Either the vendor never releases the new blinded certificate (message 4) unless he is payed or we assume some protocol for fair exchange <ref> [10, 3] </ref>. The latter choice properly partitions responsibility without complicating recovery. There are alternatives to this protocol. For example, certificates could include a credit balance, which must be periodically paid. Payment would be made as a transaction.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand customers have an interest in the privacy of their personal information, in particular the privacy of profiles of their commercial activity. One well known approach to this problem is to allow a customer to register with vendors under pseudonyms, one for each vendor <ref> [4] </ref>. By conducting transactions using anonymous electronic cash (e-cash) the customer's anonymity is maintained. But, the vendor is able to protect his interests by maintaining a profile on each of his anonymous customers. In this paper we present effectively the opposite solution to this problem. <p> For e-mail, anonymous remailers can be used to forward mail through a service that promises not to reveal the sender's identity to the recipient. User's worried about traffic analysis can use Babel [12] or other Mixmaster [8] based remailers which forward messages through a series of Chaum mixes <ref> [4] </ref>. Each mix can identify only the previous and next mix, and never (both) the sender and recipient. For Web browsing, the Anonymizer [1] provides a degree of protection. Web connections made through the Anonymizer are anonymized.

[16] or Cybercash [7] or simply sending credit card numbers over SSL). <p> In an off-line scheme, double spending must be detectable later, and the identity of the double spender must then be revealed. Previously agreed upon penalties can then be applied that make double spending not cost effective. Chaum's notion of blinding <ref> [5] </ref> is a fundamental technique used in anonymous e-cash and assigning pseudonyms. A bank customer may want a certain amount of e-cash from the bank, but may not trust the bank not to mark (and record) the e-cash in some way. <p> Unlike e-cash, however, transferability is not desirable. We use hashing of random numbers and blinding in our development of unlinkable certificates. Our unlinkable certificates differ from Chaum's pseudonyms <ref> [5] </ref> which are an alternative to a universal identification system. Each pseudonym is supposed to identify its owner to some institution and not be linkable across different institutions. Unlinkable serial certificates are designed to be unlinkable both across institutions and across transactions within a single institution.

Reference-contexts: After the money is spent, the bank must record the hash to prevent it from being spent again. This scheme can be combined with blinding, to hide the actual e-cash certificate from the bank during withdrawal. One off-line e-cash scheme is presented in <ref> [11] </ref>. There, the bank signs blinded certificates. To spend the e-cash, the customer must respond to a vendor's challenge. The response can be checked by inspecting the e-cash.

Reference-contexts: If the randomly chosen certificates turn out to be legitimate when unblinded, the bank can have confidence that the remaining blinded certificate is legitimate too. One on-line e-cash scheme is presented in <ref> [15] </ref>. To obtain an e-cash certificate that only he can use, a customer presents the bank with a hash of a random number. The bank signs an e-cash certificate linking that hash with a denomination.

Applications of our protocol that require payment are not dependent on the payment mechanisms used. Thus, our protocol can be easily applied now but is equally amenable to use with e-cash.

Onion routing <ref> [17] </ref> provides anonymizing services for a variety of Internet services over connections that are resistant to traffic analysis. Like Babel, onion routing can be used for e-mail. Onion routing can also be used to hide Web browsing, remote logins, and file transfers.
