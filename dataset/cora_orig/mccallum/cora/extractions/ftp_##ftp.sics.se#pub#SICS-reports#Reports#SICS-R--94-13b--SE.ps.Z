Abstract: Report R94:13b ISRN SICS-R-94/13b-SE ISSN 0283-3638 Abstract We have defined and implemented a method for analysis of the CCP language AKL in the spirit of abstract interpretation that uses a static set of semantic equations which abstracts the concurrent execu - tion of an AKL program. The method strictly separates the setting up of the equation system from the solving of the system with a fixpoint procedure. The computation strategies used, results for a number of test programs and the conclusions we draw from this experimental effort are reported.
