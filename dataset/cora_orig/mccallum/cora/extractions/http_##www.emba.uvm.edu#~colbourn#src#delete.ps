Reference-contexts: If k 62 K, this indicates that there is exactly one block of size k in the PBD. On the other hand, if k 2 K, then there is at least one block of size k in the PBD. See <ref> [1] </ref> and [3] for background on PBDs and designs. 1 The objective of this paper is to show that certain line configurations can be re-moved from the projective plane to obtain some interesting PBDs. <p> Lemma 4.1 If q is an odd prime power, then there exists a projective plane of order q containing an anti-Fano configuration. Proof: It is known that the desarguesian projective plane of order q, q odd, does not contain a projective subplane of order 2 <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For more complete results on closures of sets with three consecutive block sizes, see [6] and [5]. Naturally, the idea of employing configurations in finite planes to produce PBDs is far from new; see <ref> [2] </ref> and [3] for related results. The results here are general; while we illustrate them primarily with their consequences for B (fk; k + 1; k + 2g) when k is small, the goal is really to develop general observations about simple configurations in planes.

Reference-contexts: However, if we restrict that no three corners in a dual k-arc are collinear, we can obtain some more PBDs with consecutive block sizes. We call a dual k-arc scattering if no three of the corner points obtained from six different lines are collinear. From Lemma 9.1.1 in <ref> [4] </ref>, one obtains a necessary condition on scattering dual k-arcs. Lemma 3.12 A scattering dual k-arc in a projective plane of order q must satisfy k (k 1)(k 2)(k 3) + 8k 8 (q 2 + q + 1). However, the necessary condition is not sufficient.

Reference-contexts: Numerous applications of PBDs with three but not four consecutive block sizes are given in <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. In determining existence of PBDs on v points with block sizes fk; k + 1; k + 2g, often the most difficult cases seem to arise when v is greater than (k + 2) 2 , but not much greater. <p> For more complete results on closures of sets with three consecutive block sizes, see [6] and <ref> [5] </ref>.
