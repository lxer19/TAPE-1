Abstract: We examine the estimation of selectivities for range and spatial join queries in real spatial databases. As we have shown earlier [FK94a], real point sets: (a) violate consistently the "uniformity" and "independence" assumptions, (b) can often be described as "fractals", with non-integer (fractal) dimension. In this paper we show that, among the infinite family of fractal dimensions, the so called "Correlation Dimension" D 2 is the one that we need to predict the selectivity of spatial join. The main contribution is that, for all the real and synthetic point-sets we tried, the average number of neighbors for a given point of the point-set follows a power law, with D 2 as the exponent. This immediately solves the selectivity estimation for spatial joins, as well as for "biased" range queries (i.e., queries whose centers prefer areas of high point density). We present the formulas to estimate the selectivity for the biased queries, including an integration constant (K `shape 0 ) for each query shape. Finally, we show results on real and synthetic point sets, where our formulas achieve very low relative errors (typically about 10%, versus

Reference-contexts: Even in simulation studies, researchers on spatial access methods and multi-attribute query optimization are forced to use ad-hoc, non-uniform distributions, such as the Gaussian distribution [NS86], some sort of clustered distributions (with points clustering around uniformly distributed sites [Ore86], or points clustering around curves, like the sinusoidal curve <ref> [BKSS90] </ref>). Although these distributions are non-uniform, they suffer from two drawbacks: 1. it is unclear whether these distributions are related to real-world distributions; 2. they do not help make the analysis tractable. <p> The idea was to use concepts from the theory of fractals. Using real data sets, we showed that they indeed behave as fractals and we showed how to accurately predict the performance of R-trees [Gut84], <ref> [BKSS90] </ref> using the Hausdorff fractal dimension (D 0 ) of the target point-set. Next we introduce the basic concepts from the theory of fractals.

Reference-contexts: In general, the characteristic of fractals is this self-similarity property: parts of the fractal are similar (exactly or statistically) to the whole fractal. For our experiments we use 5,000 sample points from the Sierpinski triangle (termed `Sierpinski5K' dataset from now on), using Barnsley's algorithm of Iterated Function Systems <ref> [BS88] </ref> to generated these points quickly. (a): `Sierpinski5K' dataset (b): `StrLine3D' dataset Like all fractals, the Sierpinski triangle is a rich source of paradoxes: it is a point-set * with area zero (being proportional to: lim i!1 (3=4) i ), * and with infinite-length perimeter (proportional to lim i!1 (1 +
