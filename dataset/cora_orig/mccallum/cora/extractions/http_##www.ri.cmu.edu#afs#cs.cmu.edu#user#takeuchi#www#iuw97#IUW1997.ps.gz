Title: Abstract  
Abstract: Recognizing landmark is a critical task for mobile robots. Landmarks are used for robot positioning, and for building maps of unknown environments. In this context, the traditional recognition techniques based on strong geometric models cannot be used. Rather, models of landmarks must be built from observations using image-based visual learning techniques. Beyond its application to mobile robot navigation, this approach addresses the more general problem of identifying groups of images with common attributes in sequences of images. We show that, with the appropriate domain constraints and image descriptions, this can be done using efficient algorithms as follows: Starting with a training sequence of images, we identify groups of images corresponding to distinctive landmarks. Each group is described by a set of feature distributions. At run-time, the observed images are compared with the sets of models in order to recognize the landmarks in the input stream.

Reference-contexts: An object model is built by extracting features from a collection of observations. The most significant features are extracted for the entire set and are used in the model representation. Extension to generic object recognition were presented recently <ref> [Carlsson, 1996] </ref>. Other recent approaches use the images directly to extract a small set of characteristic images of the objects which are compared with observed views at recognition time. For example, the eigen-images techniques are based on this idea.

Reference-contexts: The information most relevant to recognition is extracted from the collection of raw images and used as the model for recognition. This process is often referred to as visual learning. Progress has been made recently in developing such approaches. For example, in object modeling <ref> [Gros et al.] </ref>, 2D or 3D model of objects are built for recognition applications. An object model is built by extracting features from a collection of observations. The most significant features are extracted for the entire set and are used in the model representation. <p> The main goal of the work presented here was to explore the use of tools and methods in the field of image retrieval to the problem of landmark recognition. It is clear that the global architecture of the system is close to that of object recognition systems <ref> [Gros et al.] </ref>: a training stage in which 3D shape, 2D aspects, or groups, are characterized is followed by a recognition stage in which this information is used to recognize the models, objects or groups in new images.

Reference-contexts: This provided the ground truth for evaluating the performance of the algorithm. Vehicle position was recorded using the INS system onboard a HMMWV used in a separate Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) project <ref> [Hebert et al., 1996] </ref>. Using the algorithm outlined above, all the images in the test sequence were compared with the landmarks found in the training sequence. The images corresponding to a distinct distance minimum are labeled with the corresponding landmark number.

Reference-contexts: Worse, it is often not known in advance which of the objects observed in the environment would constitute good landmarks. A similar problem, although in a different context, is encountered in image indexing, where the main problem is to store and organize images to facilitate their retrieval <ref> [Lamiroy et al., 1996] </ref> [Schmid et al., 1996]. The emphasis in this case is the kind of features used and the type of requests that can be made by the user. Our approach tries to combine these two categories of systems.

Reference-contexts: This distance, in its simplest form, evaluates the probability that two sets of data, here the histograms or the densities, are derived from the same theoretical distribution. If the distributions are h = (h i ) and l = (l i ), their difference is computed as <ref> [Press et al., 1992] </ref>: d (h, l) = S i (h i - l i ) 2 /(h i + l i ). The main problem is to derive a global distance between two images from the individual distances computed for each type of density and histogram.
