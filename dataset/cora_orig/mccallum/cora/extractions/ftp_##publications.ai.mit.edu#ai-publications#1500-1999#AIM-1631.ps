Reference-contexts: For example, the class of differentiable manifolds with boundary is not closed under the product manifold construction: Consider the unit interval I = <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. <p> For example, Abelson, et. al., describe a novel new approach to computing that may be able to exploit the locality inherent in finite difference and finite element approximations to perform computations in parallel <ref> [1] </ref>. 56 unknown values, thus combining local equations into a global system. In this figure, the triangular nodes belong to chart 1, while the circular nodes belong to chart 2. There are several possibilities for applying finite difference techniques to manifolds. <p> Thus, the source code will not be included here because they are not very illuminating. The problem in which we are interested is the rectangular slot problem: Consider the unit square = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> fi [0; 1], depicted in Figure 3-4. Given the electric potential on the boundary of and the condition that there are no charges in the interior of , what is the electric potential everywhere inside ?

As motivating examples for the main definitions, problems in classical mechanics are presented using the manifold formalism.

Reference-contexts: A well-known theorem then states that u satisfies Laplace's equation if and only if it has the mean value property. The equivalence of Laplace's equation and the mean-value property has many important consequences; Ahlfors <ref> [3] </ref> contains more details.

Reference-contexts: Also, Guillemin and Pollack give a beautifully lucid exposition on the topology of manifolds [14]. A more technical and abstract treatment is given in Warner [28], and the classic by Arnold <ref> [4] </ref> presents manifolds in the context of classical mechanics|An approach followed closely in spirit in this chapter. 2.1 A brief introduction to manifolds This section introduces the basic notions using a physical example, which will be revisited from time to time as new concepts are developed. 2.1.1 The spherical pendulum A <p> This provides an easy way to change coordinate systems: Simply substitute the new coordinates into the Lagrangian, simplify the resulting expression, and derive the Euler-Lagrange equations for the new coordinate system. For more information on this topic, see Arnold <ref> [4] </ref>. 15 It is also possible to enforce the conservation laws as constraints, so that one integrates the equations of motion on submanifolds of the state space.

Reference-contexts: The classic treatise on partial differential equations is Courant and Hilbert [10], which may be too encyclopedic to serve as an introduction but contains a lot of good stuff. A very brief but clear survey article appears in the McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science & Technology <ref> [5] </ref>. Notational and mathematical conventions This section will not rigorously define such terms as open set, closed set, and boundary, since these topological concepts should be fairly intuitive in this setting. It will only define some notations and terms not commonly covered in introductory calculus courses.

Reference-contexts: here depend on efficient mesh generators, which are most easily constructed for two dimensions. 1 However, it should be noted that there exist much more powerful mesh generators than the one used here, and hence the programs developed in this section should generalize to higher dimensions without too much difficulty <ref> [6] </ref>. Appendix A briefly describes some background material on partial differential equations, including a brief treatment of finite element methods and an even less complete description of iterative solution methods for sparse linear systems of equations. <p> Another way is to generate a set of nodes that fill V "densely," and to triangulate them using a mesh generation algorithm such as quickhull <ref> [6] </ref>, which works for general n-dimensional convex polytopes. Having generated a mesh over each chart, one can then apply standard finite element methods, such as Rayleigh-Ritz or Galerkin's method, to the open subset V of R n . This yields locally discretized equations for each chart. <p> Thus, the mathematical proof does not actually supply a solution to the computational problem of triangulating a manifold. In fact, the merging of local meshes into global ones is the main bottleneck of the entire process. As shown by the quickhull algorithm <ref> [6] </ref>, one can always efficiently triangulate convex subsets of Euclidean spaces. Thus, the only major problem is the merging of local meshes into global ones. One possible solution is to use abstractions other than manifolds to describe spaces with complex geometries.

Reference-contexts: Readers unfamiliar with these topics may wish to take a look at Appendix A first, and to use Vichnevetsky [27] as a more in-depth reference. Petersson [23] describes the solution of PDEs using multiple coordinate systems in a more specialized and less abstract context, as do Chesshire and Henshaw <ref> [7] </ref>. Note that this chapter focuses on elliptic boundary-value problems, although many of the ideas extend to more general problems. Hyperbolic initial-value problems are considered in the next chapter. The rest of this chapter begins with an exploration of theoretical representations of partial differential operators on manifolds. <p> The price we paid for simplicity in the combination phase is that the local problem becomes more difficult. Chesshire and Henshaw avoid these difficulties by using a different approach <ref> [7] </ref>: Their method uses locally regular grids for local discretization, and instead of copying nodes (which destroys the regularity of local grids in the method outlined above), the combination phase is carried out by using interpolation functions between nodes. <p> First, we can use more sophisticated methods of generating constraint equations and choosing interpolation nodes, such as the methods proposed in Chesshire and Henshaw <ref> [7] </ref> or Petersson [23]. While this will not avoid the necessity of computing the normal equations, it does hold the hope of minimizing the effects of the rigidity problem.

Reference-contexts: But this turns out to be a rather difficult problem. For more details, Clark, et. al., present and analyze one possible way of carrying out this procedure, and describe its application to image processing <ref> [8] </ref>. 59 Applying this approximation twice to f at x, we have an estimate of the second derivative of f : f (x + h) + f (x h) 2f (x) Now suppose we are interested in solving the boundary value problem for Laplace's equation over some region in R n

Reference-contexts: Johnson [17] also contains a clear and more detailed account of finite element methods. For an analytical approach, the opening chapters of Fritz John's text [16] offer a good introduction.

Reference-contexts: A global finite element method should work rather nicely on a manifold. Or one could exploit the meshless methods developed by Duarte and Oden <ref> [11] </ref>, which explicitly build partitions of unity using discrete sample points without first generating a mesh. This has the advantage that one does not need to think about combining meshes to use these methods on manifolds.

However, those applications would take us too far afield and will not be discussed here. For more information, please see either Guillemin and Pollack <ref> [14] </ref> or Warner [28]. Recall the change of variables theorem (3.19): Z f (y)dy = x2V 1 where f is a function on B and : A ! B is a smooth bijection. In x3.4.1, this theorem is used to define integrals of scalar-valued functions on compact Riemannian manifolds.

Reference-contexts: the theoretical insight it provides; like partial differential operators in x3.1, the code used in this chapter can seem ad-hoc and confusing without a proper framework in mind. 22 A good introduction to general topology and such concepts as compactness, connectedness, and conti nuity for general topological spaces is Munkres <ref> [19] </ref>. 76 3.4.2 More about boundaries This section picks up where x2.1.8 left off: In order to discuss the computational solution of elliptic boundary-value problems on manifolds, it is necessary to build a computational framework for working with boundary charts and manifolds with boundaries.

Improving interpolation methods For the sake of completeness, let us take a brief look at how well these variations on interpolation methods work. <p> A distinctly different approach would be to simply do finite differences on regular grids, and to basically follow the Chesshire-Henshaw idea. While their idea works well for some special problems, however, there are cases when their idea produces less reasonable answers. For a discussion of this, see <ref> [23] </ref>. 3.6.2 Improvements to finite elements To improve the performance of finite element methods on manifolds, on the other hand, probably requires more work.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the larger the condition number is, the closer the matrix is to being singular, and it becomes increasingly difficult to obtain numerically accurate solutions. For a more thorough discussion of condition numbers, as well as a discussion of this particular problem, see <ref> [24] </ref>. 62 smaller squares, over which the nodal values are averaged. <p> Furthermore, the resulting Gauss-Seidel iteration matrix again has a spectral radius close to 1, making convergence extremely slow. 31 This is what the procedure sparse-normal-equations does. While there exist much better methods for producing least-squares solutions to overdetermined systems, such as singular value decomposition (also known as SVD; see <ref> [24] </ref>), they do not apply easily to large systems of equations.
