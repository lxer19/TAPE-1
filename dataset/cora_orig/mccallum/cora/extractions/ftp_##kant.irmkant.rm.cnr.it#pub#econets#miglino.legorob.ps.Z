Abstract: We have evolved artificial neural networks to control the wandering behavior of small robots. The task was to touch as many squares in a grid as possible during a fixed period of time. A number of the simulated robots were embodied in small Lego (Trademark) robot, controlled by a Motorola (Trademark) 6811 processor; and their performance was compared to the simulations. We observed that: (a) evolution was an effective means to program control; (b) progress was characterized by sharply stepped periods of improvement, separated by periods of stasis that corresponded to levels of behavioral/computational complexity; and (c) the simulated and realized robots behaved quite similarly, the realized robots in some cases outperforming the simulated ones. Introducing random noise to the simulations improved the fit somewhat (from 0.73 to 0.79). Hybrid simulated/embodied selection regimes for evolutionary robots are discussed.

Reference-contexts: as it would take to build and observe the actual robot itself. (b) Integrate physical realizations of some parts of the robots together with simulations of other parts, e.g. evaluate the robots to be selected based upon combined simulations for the slower components with actual realizations for the faster parts <ref> [1] </ref>; and (c) Use hybrid simulated/embodied selection regimes - large numbers of simulated robots are first examined, but only the most promising subset of these are actually built and examined, thereby reducing the scope of the problem . <p> Hybrid regimes where some parts of the robot are simulated and some are physically realized, as discussed by Bagrodia and Shen <ref> [1] </ref>, also seem promising. We suggest that this will be a fertile ground for further advances. Acknowledgments We thank Fred Martin and Randy Sargent, and Michael Croddy for their assistance in this study.

Reference-contexts: For example, to move from the center of one square to the center of another at a 45 degree angle would require moving 10 * Sqrt <ref> [2] </ref> cm, a significantly greater distance. For simplicity we chose to ignore this difference for the simulations, and ruled that one step would relocate the robot onto one of its 8 neighboring squares, depending on the direction it was facing.

Reference-contexts: The number of steps allowed was 400, typically occurring in 5.5 - 6 minutes, depending on battery condition, sequence of steps, etc. The robot was controlled by an artificial neural network, for reasons described by Jefferson et al. [12], and by Collins and Jefferson <ref> [5] </ref>. It was a recurrent network inspired by Elman [8], with 2 sensory units, 2 output units, 2 hidden units, and 1 memory unit (Figure 2).

Reference-contexts: recombination for this theory and the decreasing opportunity for incremental improvements of performance for selection limits, we think that is unlikely. 3.2 Detailed Study of One Simulation There were sharp and large discontinuities in the evolution we observed, much like those associated with the theory of punctuated evolution (see e.g. <ref> [7] </ref>). This is especially true for the top scoring individuals, but occurred for populations means as well. To understand this better, we examined the course of one population in detail, illustrated in figure 6c.

Reference-contexts: The robot was controlled by an artificial neural network, for reasons described by Jefferson et al. [12], and by Collins and Jefferson [5]. It was a recurrent network inspired by Elman <ref> [8] </ref>, with 2 sensory units, 2 output units, 2 hidden units, and 1 memory unit (Figure 2). Although the microprocessor contained over 12K bytes of memory, most of this was required by the Micro-C compiler, leaving only a small amount available for the controlling program itself.

Reference-contexts: We surmise that if more robots could have been practically evaluated (i.e. automatically), and if that evaluation could become part of the selection criterion, then performance might have been further improved. The correlation between simulated and observed performance was 0.73. From well-understood theoretical principles of quantitative genetics (e.g. <ref> [9] </ref>), it seems likely that better performance would be obtainable through selection for correlated characters, on the basis of measured behavior. Hybrid regimes where some parts of the robot are simulated and some are physically realized, as discussed by Bagrodia and Shen [1], also seem promising.

Reference-contexts: Because our objective has been to study issues in biology and psychology, our efforts have been directed toward those robots which are sometimes called mobile autonomous vehicles, or mobots, as opposed to moveable arms often used for industrial manufacturing <ref> [13] </ref>. For such vehicles the conventional wisdom has been that simulations are of limited usefulness for predicting the behavior of real robots [2,3]. This is because the real world is so complicated and the imperfections of physical robots so limiting, that simulations sometimes make a poor guide for their behavior.
