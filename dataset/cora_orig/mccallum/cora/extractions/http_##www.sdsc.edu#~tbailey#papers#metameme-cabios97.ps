Reference-contexts: This paper addresses that need by developing hidden Markov models which precisely model only the highly conserved regions of a family of sequences. These motif-based HMMs consist primarily of motif models generated by MEME (Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation) <ref> [ Bailey and Elkan, 1995a; Bailey and Elkan, 1995b ] </ref> . Meta-MEME is a software tool for combining MEME motif models within a standard linear HMM framework. Because Meta-MEME operates in an automated fashion, it is particularly useful for analyzing the increasingly large sequence databases becoming available.

Reference-contexts: Note that, although the resulting model is tuned to find motifs which appear no more than once in each sequence, it may still find repeated motifs. We use Dirichlet mixtures for prior probabilities, modified by the megaprior heuristic <ref> [ Bailey and Gribskov, 1996 ] </ref> . The minimum width of a motif is specified as 12 (although the motifs returned may be shorter than this, due to a shortening heuristic in MEME), and the maximum width is 55.

Reference-contexts: In order to use the standard HMM framework, the motifs must be arranged in a linear fashion. Ideally, the order and spacing of motifs should reflect the canonical order and spacing of motifs in the family. The Motif Annotation and Search Tool (MAST) <ref> [ Bailey and Gribskov, 1997 ] </ref> is part of the MEME software distribution [ MEME, 1996 ] . MAST searches a database for motif occurrences and assigns a score to each sequence based upon the sequence's most likely match to each of the given motifs.

Reference-contexts: A model based upon a smaller data set may overfit the data, modelling details specific to the training set but not to the larger protein family. In order to avoid overfitting, standard HMMs often rely upon a set of Bayesian prior probabilities <ref> [ Brown et al., 1995; Sjolander et al., 1996 ] </ref> . In this case, however, with a small training set and a large model, the trained model may depend upon the prior probabilities more than it reflects the training sequences.

Reference-contexts: This information differentiates homologs from unrelated proteins which contain isolated fragments resembling sequences in the training set. Comparison of protein 3D structures is the most sensitive method for determining homology <ref> [ Chothia and Lesk, 1986 ] </ref> . This explains Meta-MEME's excellent ability to recognize alcohol dehydrogenase homologs as seen in Figure 4 (a).

Reference-contexts: researchers have shown that weighting schemes, which attempt to compensate for bias in the training set by assigning weights to individual sequences, may significantly improve the performance of database searching algorithms [ Henikoff and Henikoff, 1994a; Altschul et al., 1989; Sibbald and Argos, 1990; Thompson et al., 1994 ] . <ref> [ Eddy et al., 1995 ] </ref> have developed a maximum discrimination training algorithm for hidden Markov models which addresses the same problem. Use of such methods may also provide a means of improving Meta-MEME's performance. REFERENCES 11 We hope to improve Meta-MEME's models in several ways.

Reference-contexts: An ideal HMM would pick out all and only the members of the family from the rest of the database. This database search can be carried out using existing software. Two standard HMM packages are freely available, SAM [ Hughey and Krogh, 1996; SAM, 1996 ] and HMMER <ref> [ Eddy, 1995; HMMER, 1996 ] </ref> . Although the SAM package allows for slightly more complicated models, HMMER is more appropriate for our needs because it includes a variety of searching algorithms.

These thirty-eight sequences represent a small portion of the approximately 650 known dehydrogenases in genpept release 95 <ref> [ GenBank, 1996 ] </ref> . We also applied Meta-MEME to a set of 4Fe-4S ferredoxins. The family members are listed in Appendix B. These 159 sequences comprise all known 4Fe-4S ferredoxins in SWISSPROT release 33 [ Bairoch, 1994 ] .

Reference-contexts: Error bars represent standard error. into a single value. Unfortunately, for large database searches, the number of negatives far exceeds the number of positives, so ROC values must be computed to a high degree of precision. A similar statistic, ROC 50 <ref> [ Gribskov and Robinson, 1996 ] </ref> , provides a wider spread of values. ROC 50 is the area under the ROC curve plotted until 50 false positives are found.

Reference-contexts: The core of the standard model is a sequence of states, called "match states," which represent the canonical sequence for this family. Each match state corresponds to one position in the canonical sequence. This series of states is similar to a profile <ref> [ Gribskov et al., 1990 ] </ref> , since each state contains a frequency distribution across the entire alphabet. The probabilities that a given state emits each possible base are taken from this frequency distribution and are called the "emission probabilities" for that state.

Reference-contexts: Given such a set of sequences, MEME outputs one or more probabilistic models of motifs found in the data. The models consist of a frequency matrix and are therefore similar to a gapless profile. A parallelized version of MEME running on a supercomputer is available on the World-Wide Web <ref> [ Grundy et al., 1996; ParaMEME, 1996 ] </ref> . MEME motifs provide reliable indicators of family membership. If trained on a set of related sequences, MEME will build motif models of the most highly conserved regions in that data set.

Reference-contexts: Meta-MEME focuses on these regions and does not attempt to model the less-conserved, intermediate regions in detail. In many ways, Meta-MEME resembles the BLOCKS method for protein family classification <ref> [ Henikoff and Henikoff, 1994b; Henikoff and Henikoff, 1996 ] </ref> . The BLOCKMAKER program discovers highly conserved regions of protein families by combining motifs found by either the MOTIF algorithm [ Smith et al., 1990 ] or the Gibbs sampling algorithm [ Lawrence et al., 1993 ] .

Reference-contexts: The BLOCKS database [ BLOCKS, 1996 ] contains, for each known protein family, an ordered set of blocks along with the minimum and maximum observed spacings between the blocks in the training set. The BLIMPS program <ref> [ Henikoff et al., 1995 ] </ref> searches this database using a single sequence as a query, thus taking into account the order and spacing of blocks.

For example, <ref> [ Krogh et al., 1994 ] </ref> mention a lower limit of approximately 70 carefully selected training sequences in order to adequately model the globin family.

Reference-contexts: These biases would explain the relatively large standard error bars in Figure 4 (b). Such biases could have been reduced by first removing highly similar sequences using a program such as PURGE <ref> [ Neuwald and Green, 1994 ] </ref> . In addition to reducing training set bias, this approach reduces the amount of computation required during training.

Reference-contexts: In many ways, Meta-MEME resembles the BLOCKS method for protein family classification [ Henikoff and Henikoff, 1994b; Henikoff and Henikoff, 1996 ] . The BLOCKMAKER program discovers highly conserved regions of protein families by combining motifs found by either the MOTIF algorithm <ref> [ Smith et al., 1990 ] </ref> or the Gibbs sampling algorithm [ Lawrence et al., 1993 ] . Individual blocks may be represented as ungapped position-specific scoring matrices, similar to the motif models created by MEME.

Reference-contexts: Even for speech recognition systems, for which the training set size is relatively large, researchers attempt to simplify their models in order to reduce the number of trainable parameters <ref> [ Woodland et al., 1994 ] </ref> . When modeling biological sequences, the need for smaller models is even more pronounced. This paper addresses that need by developing hidden Markov models which precisely model only the highly conserved regions of a family of sequences.
