Abstract: We present the wireless routing protocol (WRP). In WRP, routing nodes communicate the distance and second-to-last hop for each destination. WRP reduces the number of cases in which a temporary routing loop can occur, which accounts for its fast convergence properties. A detailed proof of correctness is presented and its performance is compared by simulation with the performance of the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm (DBF), DUAL (a loop-free distance-vector algorithm) and an ideal link-state algorithm (ILS), which represent the state of the art of internet routing. The simulation results indicate that WRP is the most efficient of the alternatives analyzed.

According to DBF, a routing node knows the length of the shortest path from each neighbor to every network destination and this information is used to compute the shortest path and successor in the path to each destination.

Reference-contexts: Also, DSDV uses both periodic and triggered updates for updating routing information, which could cause excessive communication overhead. A distributed routing algorithm for mobile wireless networks based on diffusing computations has been proposed by Corson and Ephremides <ref> [6] </ref>. This protocol relies on the exchange of short control packets forming a query-reply process. It also has the ability to maintain multiple paths to a given destination. This is a destination-oriented protocol in which separate versions of the algorithm run independently for each destination.

Reference-contexts: To address these problems, we have proposed a path-finding algorithm, PFA, which substantially reduces temporary looping situations <ref> [13] </ref>, and which limits routing table updates to include only that entries affected by a network change.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, there is a need for a new routing protocol which is devoid of all these drawbacks. In the recent past, a number of efforts have been made to address the limitation of DBF and topology broadcast in mobile wireless networks. One such effort is the DSDV protocol <ref> [14] </ref>. In this protocol, each mobile host, which is a specialized router that periodically advertises its view of the interconnection topology with other mobile hosts within the network to maintain up to date information about the status of the network.

The library provides a standard input syntax and a framework for constructing simulations consisting of routers attached to each other via links. Drama itself is an extension to C. The network simulation library treats both routers and links as actors.
