Title: Frobenius's degree formula and Toda's polynomials  
Author: Jin-Yi Cai 
Abstract: We discuss a connection between the degree formula of Frobenius in group representation theory and a family of polynomials used by Toda in his proof of the containment P H P #P . The connection gives us a construction and proof of a generalized family of Toda polynomials.
