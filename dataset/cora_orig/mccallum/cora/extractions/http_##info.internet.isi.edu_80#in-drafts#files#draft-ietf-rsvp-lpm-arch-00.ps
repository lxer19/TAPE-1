Pubnum: RSVP  Memo  
Abstract: This document is an Internet-Draft. Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Note that other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts. Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress." Abstract This memo describes a set of building blocks for policy based admission control in RSVP. We describe an interface between RSVP and Local Policy Modules (LPM); this interface provides RSVP with policy related information, and allows Local policy modules to support various accounting and access control policies.

Reference-contexts: the reservation is shared among the different policy data objects. 3 The sharing model, and the selection of cost allocation and actual debiting mechanisms is an issue of LPM local configuration, and is not discussed in this document. 3.3.5 Security issues Hop-by-hop authentication mechanism: The RSVP security mechanism proposed in <ref> [BAK96] </ref> relies on hop-by-hop authentication. This form of authentication creates a chain of trust that is only as strong as its weakest element (in our case, the weakest router).

Reference-contexts: Edge Pricing is an extension of simple debiting: Edge Pricing can determine how much is to be debited, and the set of credentials associated with the reservation determines who (which account) should be debited. 4. MultiCost (MCost) MCost is an accounting scheme (and mechanism) that was introduced in <ref> [HER95] </ref>. MCost has a unique feature: it takes into account the benefits of sharing a multi-cast tree and distributes these savings among the members of the multicast group, according to configurable policies, basic fairness, and equality.

Reference-contexts: Here, the basic idea is that market forces would be the driving force behind what users specify as their willingness to pay. 3. Edge Pricing Edge Pricing was presented in <ref> [SHE95] </ref>. This paradigm is based on the assumption that network costs can be estimated and approximated at the edge of the network, based on purely local information.
