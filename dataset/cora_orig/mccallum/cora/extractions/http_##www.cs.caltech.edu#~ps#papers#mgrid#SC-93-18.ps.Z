Reference-contexts: Obstacle problems play an important role in the mathematical modeling of a variety of free boundary problems, arising for instance in porous media flow, device simulation or nonlinear mechanics. We refer to Baiocchi and Capelo <ref> [1] </ref>, Cottle et al. [7], Glowinski [11], Kinderlehrer and Stampaccia [19] or Rodrigues [27] for detailed information. Let T j be a given partition of in triangles t 2 T j with minimal diameter of order 2 j . <p> Then we have from Lemma 2.1 that v l = ! l v fl l with some ! l 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Following Bank et al. <ref> [3] </ref>, a triangle t 2 T k is refined either by subdividing it into four congruent subtriangles or by connecting one of its vertices to the midpoint of the opposite side.

Reference-contexts: This single-grid relaxation typically suffers from rapidly deteriorating convergence rates when proceeding to more and more refined triangulations. This undesirable behavior stimulated the development of various multigrid methods based on a hierarchy of triangulations <ref> [6, 4, 14, 15, 16, 17, 25, 26, 30] </ref>. However, even if applied to simple model problems, all those methods suffer either from missing robustness or from unsatisfactory convergence rates. <p> Note that BRCR entered an infinite loop if applied to the same problem on the lower refinement level j = 4, while (slow) convergence occurred for j = 5. This lack of robustness of Brandt and Cryer's method is well-known for quite a while (c.f. Bollrath <ref> [4] </ref>, p. 29). However, such cases as resulting from the choice of C = 10: were considered as artificial compared to moderate situations as provided by C = 2:5.

Reference-contexts: The concept of extended underrelaxations as described herein is open to various generalizations. For example, the treatment of more general boundary conditions and lower or double obstacle problems is obvious. In view of re 3 cent work on multilevel methods in three space dimensions (c.f. Bornemann et al. <ref> [5] </ref>, Erdmann et al. [9, 10]), the extension of the presented algorithms to the 3-D case is straightforward.

Reference-contexts: This single-grid relaxation typically suffers from rapidly deteriorating convergence rates when proceeding to more and more refined triangulations. This undesirable behavior stimulated the development of various multigrid methods based on a hierarchy of triangulations <ref> [6, 4, 14, 15, 16, 17, 25, 26, 30] </ref>. However, even if applied to simple model problems, all those methods suffer either from missing robustness or from unsatisfactory convergence rates. <p> In multigrid terminology, the unsymmetric truncation of coarse-grid basis functions amounts to well-known perturbations of the weighted restrictions and prolongations in the neighborhood of the free boundary. It seems that the good convergence properties of the multigrid method proposed by Brandt and Cryer <ref> [6] </ref> are an outcome of such modified restrictions and prolongations. However, the present lack of a convergence proof may be due to the slightly inconsistent use of these modifications. The final Section 4 is devoted to some illustrative numerical experiments. <p> For the unsymmetric method, we also found a better convergence behavior than for the considered variant of Brandt and Cryer's method <ref> [6] </ref>, which in turn was mostly superior to the symmetric scheme, but failed in some of our numerical experiments. Moreover, using the interpolated results from the previous level, we observed the same efficiency of the constrained unsymmetric multigrid method as in the corresponding unconstrained case. <p> To avoid unnecessary computational work, the possibly varying restriction of the stiffness matrix has to be implemented carefully. We have recovered the well-known local modifications of the canonical restrictions and prolongations in the neighborhood of the free boundary (c.f. Brandt and Cryer <ref> [6] </ref> ). Recall that the way we are using these modifications is jus tified by the convergence results mentioned above. <p> SYMMA: The symmetric multigrid method proposed by Mandel [25, 26]. SYMKH: The symmetric multigrid method with new restriction of the defect obstacle (c.f. Theorem 3.1). BRCR: A variant of the multigrid methods proposed by Brandt and Cryer <ref> [6] </ref>. UNSYMKH: The unsymmetric multigrid method with modified new restric tions (c.f. Theorem 3.2). For all four methods we only consider the V-cycle with one pre-smoothing step. The multigrid method BRCR needs some further explanation. <p> Note that BRCR seems to be the most prominent of several other variants 18 proposed in <ref> [6] </ref>. Though there is a lot of similarity to the unsymmetric method, BRCR is not monotone. The implementation was carried out in the framework of the finite element code KASKADE (c.f. Roitzsch [28, 29]) and we used a SPARC IPX workstation for the actual computation.

Reference: [11] <author> R. Glowinski: </author> <title> Numerical Methods for Nonlinear Variational Problems. </title> <publisher> Springer Verlag, </publisher> <address> New York (1984) 22 </address>
Reference-contexts: The quadratic functional J , J (v) = 1 is induced by a continuous, symmetric and H 1 0 ()-elliptic bilinear form a (v; w) = i;j=1 and a linear functional ` 2 H 1 (). It is well-known (c.f. Glowinski <ref> [11] </ref>) that the obstacle problem (1.1) can be rewritten as the following elliptic variational inequality of the first kind u 2 K : a (u; v u) `(v u); v 2 K; (1.4) and admits a unique solution u 2 K. <p> Obstacle problems play an important role in the mathematical modeling of a variety of free boundary problems, arising for instance in porous media flow, device simulation or nonlinear mechanics. We refer to Baiocchi and Capelo [1], Cottle et al. [7], Glowinski <ref> [11] </ref>, Kinderlehrer and Stampaccia [19] or Rodrigues [27] for detailed information. Let T j be a given partition of in triangles t 2 T j with minimal diameter of order 2 j . We denote the set of interior nodes and edges by N j and E j , respectively. <p> Of course, (1.6) is uniquely solvable and can be reformulated as the variational inequality u j 2 K j : a (u j ; v u j ) `(v u j ); v 2 K j : (1.6) It is well-known (c.f. Glowinski <ref> [11] </ref>) that u j is converging to u in H 1 0 (), if the meshsize of T j tends to zero and the interior angles of t 2 T j are uniformly bounded from below. Let fl j denote the set of nodal basis functions of S j . <p> It is clear from (2.8) and (2.10) that u fl j is also a fixed point of the single-grid relaxation, which is well-known to have the unique fixed point u j (c.f. <ref> [11] </ref>). This gives the assertion. We still have to show the convergence of the corrections (2.10). Recall that the optimal correction v fl l = v fl l (w l1 ), resulting from the exact evaluation of the next local subproblem, satisfies the variational inequality (2.1). <p> In particular, a related convergence result for elliptic variational inequalities of the second kind (i.e. Theorem 2.1 in [20]) can be shown almost literally in the same way. The convergence of single-grid relaxations applied to other elliptic variational inequalities is discussed to some extend by Glowinski <ref> [11] </ref>. The remainder of this section is devoted to the asymptotic behavior of extended underrelaxations. We define the active set N * j (w) of some w 2 S j as the subset of nodes p 2 N j with the property w (p) = ' j (p).

Reference-contexts: Hence, we improve the coarse-grid transport by suitable unsymmetric truncation of the coarse-grid functions 2 fl c (c.f. Hoppe and Kornhuber <ref> [18] </ref>), providing variable search directions M - = fl j [ ~ fl - c , - 0, which depend on the actual guess of the discrete free boundary. As a consequence, the possible inactivation of active points is performed only on the fine grid. <p> The first case is called regular (red) refinement while the second case is referred to as irregular (green) refinement. The refinement process has to obey further structural rules, which are meanwhile standard in the literature on multilevel methods <ref> [2, 3, 8, 18, 32] </ref>. We refer for example to Yserentant [32] for further information. Let fl k = f (k) p j p 2 N k g denote the sets of nodal basis functions in S k , k = 0; : : : ; j. <p> Monotone multigrid methods induced by fl are called symmetric because the elements of the reduced set fl ffi may be regarded as symmetric truncations of 2 fl (see a related notation in <ref> [18] </ref>). Of course, fl is regular in the sense of the preceding section. <p> We refer for example to Rodrigues [27] for further information.

Reference-contexts: We emphasize that both the symmetric and the unsymmetric approach are permanent extensions of linear multigrid methods, reducing to the standard V-cycle with incomplete Gauss-Seidel smoother, if u j has no contact with the obstacle ' j . Applying recent results on linear multigrid methods (c.f. Kornhuber and Yserentant <ref> [23] </ref>) to the reduced linear problems, we obtain 1 O (j 2 ) estimates of the asymptotic convergence rate without any regularity assumptions on the free boundary. Global estimates of the convergence rates will be a subject of future research. <p> Moreover, Theorem 2.2 states that the iteration (2.4) asymptotically reduces to the linear scheme (2.21) induced by M ffi = fl ffi for the iterative solution of the reduced linear problem (2.20). The convergence of this linear method is investigated in a recent paper of Kornhuber and Yserentant <ref> [23] </ref>, from which the error estimate (3.11) is taken. Note that the proof of the asymptotic error estimate (3.11) is restricted to two space dimensions, referring to Kornhuber and Yserentant [23] for details. We emphasize that no regularity assumptions on the free boundary have entered into our considerations. <p> The convergence of this linear method is investigated in a recent paper of Kornhuber and Yserentant <ref> [23] </ref>, from which the error estimate (3.11) is taken.

We emphasize that no regularity assumptions on the free boundary have entered into our considerations. Excluding contributions of the coarse-grid functions l 2 fl n fl ffi may considerably deteriorate the coarse-grid transport of the linear scheme (2.21), at least compared to standard linear multigrid methods. <p> Following the proof of Theorem 3.1 the assertions are immediately deduced from Theorem 2.2 and the results in <ref> [23] </ref>. We emphasize that both the symmetric and the unsymmetric monotone multigrid method can be implemented as a usual multigrid V-cycle. Indeed, the symmetric multigrid method amounts to a sequence of projected Gauss-Seidel smoothings on the refinement levels k = j; : : : ; 0.

Though definition (3.7) looks quite natural in view of condition (3.3), it does not take advantage of the fact that the arguments v 2 S k+1 of r k k+1 are piecewise linear on T k . <p> Excluding contributions of the coarse-grid functions l 2 fl n fl ffi may considerably deteriorate the coarse-grid transport of the linear scheme (2.21), at least compared to standard linear multigrid methods. This explains, why the symmetric scheme induced by fl usually suffers from unsatisfying asymptotic convergence rates (c.f. Mandel <ref> [26] </ref>). To improve the asymptotic convergence by improved coarse-grid transport, we will extend the set fl ffi by suitable unsymmetric truncations of the multilevel nodal basis functions 2 fl. <p> The resulting discrete problems of the form (1.5) are solved iteratively comparing the four different multigrid methods described as follows. SYMMA: The symmetric multigrid method proposed by Mandel <ref> [25, 26] </ref>. SYMKH: The symmetric multigrid method with new restriction of the defect obstacle (c.f. Theorem 3.1). BRCR: A variant of the multigrid methods proposed by Brandt and Cryer [6]. UNSYMKH: The unsymmetric multigrid method with modified new restric tions (c.f. Theorem 3.2).

Reference-contexts: Obstacle problems play an important role in the mathematical modeling of a variety of free boundary problems, arising for instance in porous media flow, device simulation or nonlinear mechanics. We refer to Baiocchi and Capelo [1], Cottle et al. [7], Glowinski [11], Kinderlehrer and Stampaccia [19] or Rodrigues <ref> [27] </ref> for detailed information. Let T j be a given partition of in triangles t 2 T j with minimal diameter of order 2 j . We denote the set of interior nodes and edges by N j and E j , respectively. <p> The solution u represents the stress potential and the applied twist angle is expressed by the parameter C. We refer for example to Rodrigues <ref> [27] </ref> for further information. The elastic region is located along the diagonals of and becomes arbitraryly small with increasing C, rendering a challenging test example for various numerical methods (see [9, 12, 15, 18]).

Reference-contexts: Note that BRCR seems to be the most prominent of several other variants 18 proposed in [6]. Though there is a lot of similarity to the unsymmetric method, BRCR is not monotone. The implementation was carried out in the framework of the finite element code KASKADE (c.f. Roitzsch <ref> [28, 29] </ref>) and we used a SPARC IPX workstation for the actual computation. In our first experiment we investigate the convergence behavior of the four multigrid methods for the fixed initial iterate u 0 j = 0 and fixed refinement level j = 6.

Reference-contexts: This single-grid relaxation typically suffers from rapidly deteriorating convergence rates when proceeding to more and more refined triangulations. This undesirable behavior stimulated the development of various multigrid methods based on a hierarchy of triangulations <ref> [6, 4, 14, 15, 16, 17, 25, 26, 30] </ref>. However, even if applied to simple model problems, all those methods suffer either from missing robustness or from unsatisfactory convergence rates.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, in case of linear problems, we recover the standard multigrid V-cycle with incomplete Gauss-Seidel smoother by adding the set M c = fl c of all new coarse-grid nodal basis functions to the fine-grid nodal basis fl j . See the excellent overviews of Xu <ref> [31] </ref> and Yserentant [33] for further information. Of course, extended relaxations can be also interpreted as successive subspace corrections or nonlinear multiplicative Schwarz methods. Usually, the local optimization problems corresponding to 2 M - c cannot be evaluated efficiently, motivating the approximation by suitable inexact solvers.
