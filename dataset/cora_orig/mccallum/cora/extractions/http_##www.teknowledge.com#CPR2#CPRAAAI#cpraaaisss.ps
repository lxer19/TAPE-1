Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The Core Plan Representation (CPR) <ref> [Pease and Carrico, 1996] </ref> is an effort to develop a plan ontology which supports the representation needs of many different planning systems. It is being developed for the Joint Task Force Advanced Technology Demonstration (JTF-ATD). <p> Each new design must largely start from scratch. The CPR effort has taken the opposite approach. Whenever reasonable choices are encountered, they are recorded (see <ref> [Pease and Carrico, 1996] </ref>). name subPlans objectives actions alternatives evaluation issues Plan name objectives subActors Actor name subActions actors resources planObjects begin end Action name terms levelOfHardness subConstraints Constraint Core Plan Representation Design name terms Fact name subAnnotations Annotation Evaluation Criterion name Resource slotList Frame type value actions evaluationCriteria subObjectives Objective

Reference-contexts: While KRSL-Plans is working on developing an ontology of plans and activities, CPR is striving for an object oriented software design developed with a strong ontological awareness. It should be noted that KRSL-Plans , like CPR , is also an ongoing effort, although it began much earlier. &lt;I-NOVA&gt; <ref> [Tate, 1996] </ref> is another ongoing effort which bears some similarity to CPR due to the significant contribution of Austin Tate to the CPR effort. Another important related effort is the Process Interchange Format [Lee, 1996]. 3.
