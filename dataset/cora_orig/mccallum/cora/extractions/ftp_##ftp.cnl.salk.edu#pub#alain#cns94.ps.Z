Abstract: FAST KINETIC MODELS FOR SIMULATING AMPA, NMDA, GABA A AND GABA B RECEPTORS Alain Destexhe, Zachary F. Mainen and Terrence J. Sejnowski* The Salk Institute for Biological Studies and The Howard Hughes Medical Institute, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, California 92037 * also in the Department of Biology, University of California San Diego In: The Neurobiology of Computation, Edited by Bower, J., Kluwer Academic Press, Norwell MA, pp. 9-14, 1995. Abstract Since the introduction of the alpha function by Rall in 1967 [12], there has been significant progress in our understanding of the molecular events underlying synaptic transmission. Particular receptor types have been identified and their activation kinetics characterized. It is now possible to develop models of these receptors, using a formalism similar to that introduced by Hodgkin and Huxley [9]. In this paper, we present recently-introduced models obtained by simplifying more detailed biophysical models of postsynaptic receptors [7]. The simplified models are fully compatible with the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism, are very efficient to simulate, and account for important phenomena such as synaptic summation and desensitization. These models should be useful in large-scale network simulations. Fast kinetic models In a previous paper [7], we developed a model of synaptic transmission that incorporated the kinetics of voltage-dependent channels, the kinetics of exo-cytosis of neurotransmitter in the synapse, diffusion of the neurotransmitter and binding to postsynaptic receptors, and finally the kinetics of activation of these receptors. It was shown that introducing simplifying assumptions leads to much simpler kinetic models for a variety of receptor types, including fast transmission and neuromodulation. Synaptic receptors activate or deactivate ion channels located in the postsy-naptic cell. In the case of "fast" synaptic transmission, the receptor and the channel are part of the same protein complex. In these so-called ionotropic receptors, the ligand is a neurotransmitter and its binding to the complex leads to the opening of the associated ionophore. Ionotropic receptors include the glutamate AMPA/kainate and NMDA types, the fast GABAergic receptors 9

In the latter, L is a second messenger and occurs as a pulse of 1 M amplitude and 50-100 ms duration. These values were estimated from kinetic data of second-messenger transduction.
