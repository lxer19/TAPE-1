Abstract: In this paper, we establish the notion of divertibility as a protocol property as opposed to the existing notion as a language property (see Okamoto, Ohta [OO90]). We give a definition of protocol divertibil-ity that applies to arbitrary 2-party protocols and is compatible with Okamoto and Ohta's definition in the case of interactive zero-knowledge proofs. Other important examples falling under the new definition are blind signature protocols. A sufficient criterion for divertibility is presented and found to be satisfied by many examples of protocols in the literature. The generality of the definition is further demonstrated by examples from protocol classes that have not been considered for di-vertibility before. We show diverted El-Gamal encryption and diverted Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

Reference-contexts: Since identification protocols were developed in close relation to interactive zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), Okamoto and Ohta [OO90] (and later Desmedt and Burmester <ref> [BD91] </ref> and Ihto et al [ISS91]) established the notion of divertibility as a language property, i.e., a language is called divertible if it can be recognized by a diverted interactive zero-knowledge proof system.

Reference-contexts: If for given (a; b), an attacker could distinguish valid from invalid diverted out-messages (a 0 ; b 0 ) with non-negligible probability, i.e., probability 1 P (k) for some polynomial P , then he had broken the simultaneous discrete log assumption <ref> [CEG88] </ref>. ut 6 Conclusions and Open Questions We have introduced the notion of perfect and computational protocol divertibil-ity, and have given a sufficient criterion for the former. All diverted protocols we have found in the literature (see Appendix 7.2) turned out to satisfy this criterion.

Reference-contexts: In this Section, we investigate two examples in more detail: (i) the diverted ZKP that Okamoto and Ohta used to prove their main theorem [OO90] and (ii) a blind modified El-Gamal Signature, which was presented by Horster, Michels and Petersen [HMP95] who built on ideas of Camenisch, Piveteau and Stadler <ref> [CPS95] </ref>. More examples, all satisfying the divertibility criterion, can be found in Appendix 7.2. Since all the following protocols are based on the intractability of computing discrete logarithms, the following definitions are useful.

Reference-contexts: Both illustrate our claim that divertibility is an independent concept rather than a special topic of zero knowledge proof theory. 2 Definitions In order to deal with protocols of more than two parties, we generalize the notion of interactive Turing machine (ITM) by Goldwasser et al <ref> [GMR89] </ref>. Then we define connections of ITMs and finally give the definition of protocol divertibility. Definition 1 ((m; n)-Interactive Turing Machine). <p> This notion as well as that of polynomial indistinguishability of families of random variables is defined, e.g., by Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff <ref> [GMR89] </ref>. An immediate consequence of the definition is that if a protocol P is di--vertible, then we can insert second and third wardens and we, again, obtain a diverted protocol. 3 Main Result Theorem 4 (Criterion for Perfect Divertibility).

Reference-contexts: In Section 4, we demonstrate (i) by applying the criterion to a diverted ZKP protocol that Okamoto and Ohta used for their important result [OO90] and to an interesting blind modified El-Gamal signature by Horster et al <ref> [HMP95] </ref>.

Here, both the signer and the recipient have a private input, namely her private signing key x and his message m to be signed, respectively. The common input is the public verification key y corresponding to x.

We reconsider their diverted protocol and show that it satisfies our divertibility criterion.
