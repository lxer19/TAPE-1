Abstract: Due to the strong experimental evidence that the traffic to be offered to future broadband networks will display long-range dependence, it is important to study the possible implications that such traffic may have for the design and performance of these networks. In particular, an important question is whether the offered traffic preserves its long-range dependent nature after passing through a policing mechanism at the interface of the network. One of the proposed solutions for flow control in the context of the emerging ATM standard is the so-called leaky bucket scheme. In this paper we consider a leaky bucket system with long-range dependent input traffic. We adopt the following popular model for long-range dependent traffic : Time is discrete. At each unit time a random number of sessions is initiated, having the distribution of a Poisson random variable with mean . Each of these sessions consists of a random number t of cells, where t has finite mean, infinite variance, and a regularly varying tail, i.e. P (t &gt; k) ~ k ff L(k), where 1 &lt; ff &lt; 2 and L() is a slowly varying function. Once a session is initiated, it generates one cell at each unit of time until its termination. We examine the departure process of the leaky bucket policing mechanism driven by such an arrival process, and show that it too is long-range dependent for any token buffer size and any finite or infinite cell buffer size.

Reference-contexts: We first examine the departure process in the case C = 1. In this case the leaky bucket system is equivalent to a single-server queue that is served at a constant rate equal to one cell per unit time. Thus we have one of the cases analyzed in <ref> [1] </ref>, (i.e, the case s = 1 in the notation of [1]). We prove the following: Lemma 1. The departure process of the leaky bucket system in the case C = 1 is long-range dependent.

Reference-contexts: According to the results in [8], we may consider a stationary regime in which the departure process is stationary and ergodic this will become clear once we write the system equations later in the paper. Following Cox <ref> [5] </ref>, a stationary second-order stochastic process is defined to be long-range dependent if the sum of the absolute values of its covariances is infinite, i.e. 1 X j r (m) j= 1; (1) where r (m) the covariance function of the process. <p> In this paper we analyze a leaky bucket system with the arrival process as discussed above; a straightforward calculation shows that this arrival process is long-range dependent, see e.g. Cox <ref> [5] </ref>. We examine the stationary departure process of the system and show that it too is long-range dependent. Before going on to the statement of our results and the detailed proofs, we introduce the timing conventions and notation we will use, see Figure 1..
