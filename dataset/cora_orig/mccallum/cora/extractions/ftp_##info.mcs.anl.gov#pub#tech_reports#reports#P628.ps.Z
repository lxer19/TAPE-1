Reference-contexts: The embed algorithm (Crippen and Havel [4], Havel [11, 12]) and the alternating projection algorithm (Glunt, Hayden, and Raydan [7, 8]) are the most promising techniques for the solution of the distance geometry problem (1.2). For related work, see <ref> [1, 2, 3, 19] </ref>. General global optimization techniques (multi-starts with a local optimization algorithm, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms) and molecular dynamics algorithms could also be used, but they have not been shown to be suitable for distance geometry problems. <p> We emphasize that the determination of protein structures from distance data requires appropriate data and an algorithm to determine solutions to (1.1). The issue of what distance data is needed has been addressed in several recent papers <ref> [15, 28, 1, 20] </ref>. In this paper we do not address this issue, but concentrate on showing that dgsol can be used to obtain solutions to the distance geometry problem (1.1) for a wide range of distance data. To our knowledge, no other algorithm can make this claim.

The distance geometry problem (1.1) can be formulated as a global optimization problem. The standard formulation, suggested by Crippen and Havel [4], is in terms of finding the global minimum of the function f (x) = i;j2S where the pairwise function p i;j : R n 7! R is defined by p i;j (x) = min 2 kxk 2 l 2 l 2 ; 0 + max 2 kxk 2 u 2 <p> The approach in this paper can be extended to these chirality constraints, but since our aim is to develop reliable algorithms for the distance geometry problem (1.1), we consider only the potential function (1.2).

Reference-contexts: We used o d = 10 2 since this tolerance reflects the accuracy available for bonds lengths <ref> [5] </ref>. A secondary aim of the computational experiments is to study the dependence of the solution structures on variations on the bounds l i;j and u i;j . <p> With this formulation, we are able to study the behavior of the structures as " varies over (0; 1). We varied " over [0:04; 0:16] since this translates into a 4 16% deviation from the expected value for the bond length. These variations seem to be typical <ref> [5] </ref>. In many of our numerical results we examine the performance of dgsol as " and vary.

Reference-contexts: For details see, for example, Golub and VanLoan <ref> [9, page 582] </ref>. The coordinate error E C is commonly used to measure the deviation between structures. In particular, many researchers require that structures have an E C of 1-2 A to be considered similar, while others only require an E C of 2-3 A.

The distance geometry problem (1.1) can be formulated as a global optimization problem. <p> These constraints can be handled by adding a term to the potential function (1.2) whenever chirality constraints are imposed on the atoms x i ; x j ; x k ; x l . The chirality constraint function (for example, Havel <ref> [11, 12] </ref>) is usually of the form c i;j;k;l (x) = (vol (x i ; x j ; x k ; x l ) v i;j;k;l ) 2 ; where vol is the oriented volume of the four atoms and v i;j;k;l is a target value. <p> The approach in this paper can be extended to these chirality constraints, but since our aim is to develop reliable algorithms for the distance geometry problem (1.1), we consider only the potential function (1.2). The embed algorithm (Crippen and Havel [4], Havel <ref> [11, 12] </ref>) and the alternating projection algorithm (Glunt, Hayden, and Raydan [7, 8]) are the most promising techniques for the solution of the distance geometry problem (1.2).

Reference-contexts: Another interesting issue is the dependence of the structures on the distance data. From a mathematical viewpoint, we do not know when structures can be determined uniquely with exact, but incomplete distance data. For some results in this direction, see Hendrickson <ref> [13, 14] </ref>. Acknowledgments Our work has been influenced, in particular, by conversations with Paul Bash, Gordon Crippen, and Teresa Head-Gordon.

Reference-contexts: Other algorithms that work with a sparse set of distance constraints do not aim to solve the distance geometry problem (1.1), but to minimize a potential energy function that incorporates distance constraints and other information to determine the protein structure. For work in this direction, see <ref> [28, 15] </ref>. 2 In our approach, we use Gaussian smoothing to transform f into a smoother function with fewer minimizers. <p> We emphasize that the determination of protein structures from distance data requires appropriate data and an algorithm to determine solutions to (1.1). The issue of what distance data is needed has been addressed in several recent papers <ref> [15, 28, 1, 20] </ref>. In this paper we do not address this issue, but concentrate on showing that dgsol can be used to obtain solutions to the distance geometry problem (1.1) for a wide range of distance data.

Reference-contexts: An immediate advantage of our approach is that the work per iteration is proportional to S, which for sparse distance data should be proportional to the number of atoms m.

Reference-contexts: In particular, E C is dependent on the scaling of the coordinates. For a discussion of these deficiencies, see Mairov and Crippen <ref> [21] </ref>. If we accept the view that proteins with E C of 2-3 A are similar, then the results in Table 5.2 show that, on the average, dgsol is able to find structures that are similar to the original structure.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the Gaussian transform commutes with differentiation so that the Gaussian transform of the gradient (Hessian) is the gradient (Hessian) of the Gaussian transform. These properties of the Gaussian transform are not usually shared by other approaches to smoothing. For additional discussion of these properties, see Wu <ref> [31] </ref> and More and Wu [23, 24]. We illustrate the transformation process in Figure 2.1 with a function that is the sum of four Gaussians. The original function ( = 0) is on the left while = 0:3 is on the right.
