Reference-contexts: The system comprises of a dynamic set of machines that communicate via asynchronous multicast messages. Transis creates a daemon that runs in the background and supplies communication services to clients. For a detailed description of the Transis environment and services refer to <ref> [1] </ref>. 2 The Simulator (SIM) Layer and the Simulator The purpose of the simulator (SIM) layer is to allow a separate Simulator process to interact with processes using this layer. A user can simulate partitions in a group of processes by giving the Simulator the desired partitions.

Reference-contexts: The X-interface provided for the Simulator is a minimal version of the X-interface provided with the TXconsole tool for simulating and monitoring partitions in processor level (see <ref> [2] </ref>). The user of the Simulator sees in the main window a list of all the members of the simulation group and the the partition numbers which they belong to.
