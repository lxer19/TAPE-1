Abstract: We propose algorithms to automate the segmentation of pulmonary tree structures in the lung, using tools from Mathematical Morphology. This involves segmenting three different types of three-dimensional tree structures (airway tree, pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein) from a stack of grayscale Computed Tomography (CT) images. The proposed algorithms rely on the grayscale reconstruction operator to extract potential tree regions in each of the CT images. A three-dimensional seeded region growing is performed on the processed stack of images to obtain the segmented tree volumes. We first segment the airway tree, and use the geometric features (shape & size) of its segmented output to segment the pulmonary arterial and veinous trees. Segmentation results of pulmonary tree volumes obtained from CT image stacks of a static dog lung are very encouraging and we intend to apply these techniques on dynamic lung data in a clinical setting.

Reference-contexts: Inspiration and expiration cause changes in the pulmonary tree structures thereby changing their branch lengths, branch cross sectional area and the bifurcation angle between branches. Exact measurement of these parameters is possible only if these tree structures are segmented accurately. We provide an overview of lung physiology <ref> [1] </ref> to better understand the geometric complexity of various trees in the lung. Each lobe of a lung has an airway tree which contains the air we breath, and vascular trees which contain blood. The airway tree is surrounded throughout by an airway wall which, in turn, is blood filled. <p> The idea behind mathematical morphology is to use geometric structures of different sizes and shapes to process images, and these are known as structuring elements. The underlying model <ref> [1] </ref> we use to segment lung tree structures is that they have almost cylindrical branches which taper in size as one goes down the tree volume.

Reference-contexts: The airways correspond to low intensity regions, and the vessels along with the airway wall correspond to high intensity regions, as imaged by HRCT (Fig. 4). Although, no previous literature exists in automating the segmentation of all the tree structures in the lung, previous work <ref> [2, 3] </ref> involved efforts to automate segmentation of the airway trees alone. One study [2] involved segmenting the airways using simple thresholding techniques [4]. <p> Although, no previous literature exists in automating the segmentation of all the tree structures in the lung, previous work [2, 3] involved efforts to automate segmentation of the airway trees alone. One study <ref> [2] </ref> involved segmenting the airways using simple thresholding techniques [4]. Threshold based segmentation is conservative in selecting the threshold in order to avoid leaks (occur due to gaps in airway wall) to the background, and hence underestimates the area of airway regions in each image and the airway volume. <p> Moreover, as airways get smaller, the transition areas between airway regions and the airway wall overlap thereby reducing the intensity gradient. Hence, these airways are not captured as they do not fall within the threshold <ref> [2] </ref>. The reduction in intensity gradient in small airways coupled with blurring of the airways due to lung motion make it very hard to segment them. <p> The difficulty in segmenting vessels is that the airway wall attaches itself to the PA tree (both have similar intensities), and is almost impossible to segment using thresholding alone. In <ref> [2] </ref>, thresholding was followed up by manual processing in order to separate the PA and PV trees from the airway wall. Knowledge-based approach was tried [3] to segment airway tree alone, by using the proximity information of the PA tree to the airways.

Segmentation Algorithm for Airway Trees The algorithm to segment airways involves, performing a 2D morphological analysis to obtain potential airways in each image (Fig. 2), and then a 3D region growing of the processed image stack to obtain the segmented airway volume.

Reference-contexts: We discuss our segmentation results on volume data of static dog lung obtained from HRCT in section 5 and conclude in section 6 with possible improvements. 2. Mathematical Morphology Mathematical morphology was introduced in <ref> [7] </ref> as a tool to investigate geometric structures in images. Binary images are represented as sets in the two-dimensional Euclidean space. Geometric information from a set X is extracted by probing it with another smaller set B called the structuring element. <p> We assume knowledge of basic morphological operators like dilation (X B), erosion (X B), opening (X ffi B) and closing (X * B), both in the binary and grayscale case. The reader is referred to <ref> [7, 8] </ref> for a formal treatment. 2.1. Morphological Reconstruction Reconstruction operators have been used to obtain maxima and minima (i.e. peaks and valleys) in grayscale images. Let I and J be two binary/grayscale images. I is referred to as the mask image and J as the marker image.

Reference-contexts: Hence, by comparing the two tree topologies, one could obtain missing airways by probing near the corresponding PA branches. In order to compare the airway and PA tree volumes, as a first step, they are reduced to a straight line central axis tree <ref> [9] </ref>. By corresponding the two central axis trees [10], we can identify missing airway branches. Our approach is 2D in nature, though we used the segmented knowledge of previous images to process the current image.
