Reference-contexts: Other researchers have used spreading activation in semantic networks to retrieve analogues. Holland et. al.'s PI [Holland et al., 1986], Anderson's PUPS <ref> [Anderson and Thompson, 1989] </ref>, and Jones's EUREKA [Jones, 1989] are all general cognitive models which use spreading activation for analogue retrieval (as well as other knowledge retrieval).

Reference-contexts: Go to 2. memory (step 2 in the figure) is conducted by a spreading activation mechanism (see, e.g., <ref> [Anderson, 1983] </ref>). In this formalism, activation is passed from node to adjacent node via the links that connect them until one concept accumulates enough aggregate activation to be considered retrieved. This basic spreading activation model is a blind knowledge search mechanism.

Reference-contexts: When a KDSA search suffers from beacons that direct the search away from, rather than toward, the eventual base, KDSA still shows substantial savings over standard SA. 6 Related Work There is a large body of AI literature on information retrieval in semantic networks. SCISOR [Rau, 1987] and GRANT <ref> [Cohen and Kjeldsen, 1987] </ref> both use heuristic information to direct a spread of activation in semantic networks. KDSA's search control component is similar to the relatedness condition which controls the spread of markers in SCISOR and the path endorsements which direct spreading activation in GRANT.

Reference-contexts: In this way KDSA can account for an individual possibly "stumbling across a solution", i.e., being 1 In the computer implementation of KDSA, the agent architecture used was BB1 <ref> [Hayes-Roth, 1990] </ref>. reminded of an analogue by external or internal cues. The important components of the retrieval system are discussed in more detail below. Match Evaluation Each time a concept is retrieved by the spreading activation search as a potential base concept, it is passed to the matching component.

Reference-contexts: Edison's invention of the quadruplex telegraph was based almost entirely on an analogy to a water system of pumps, pipes, valves, and water wheels <ref> [Hughes, 1971] </ref>. And actress Hedy Lamarr conceived of a method for coordinating frequencies between sender and receiver in frequency-hopping communication by analogy to a player-piano roll [Simon et al., 1985]. These examples all show the inventor making a connection between two concepts not normally thought of as connected.

Reference-contexts: The literature on invention is full of examples of inventions that were guided by semantically distant analogies. Gutenberg invented the printing press after noticing the connection between applying force to impress script on paper and applying force to squeeze grapes in a wine press <ref> [Koestler, 1965] </ref> . Edison's invention of the quadruplex telegraph was based almost entirely on an analogy to a water system of pumps, pipes, valves, and water wheels [Hughes, 1971].

Reference-contexts: In this way KDSA can use these promising concepts as beacons along the way to the final good analogy. This is very similar to the way that promising intermediate states are used in heuristic search techniques such as hill-climbing or best-first search <ref> [Pearl and Korf, 1987] </ref>. The use of the matching component of the mechanism to provide feedback to the spreading activation search provides a key distinguishing feature of our approach.

Reference-contexts: And actress Hedy Lamarr conceived of a method for coordinating frequencies between sender and receiver in frequency-hopping communication by analogy to a player-piano roll <ref> [Simon et al., 1985] </ref>. These examples all show the inventor making a connection between two concepts not normally thought of as connected. The fact that human inventors use semantically distant analogies in their reasoning suggests that these analogies can be an important technique for computer reasoning as well.

Reference-contexts: This description of KDSA will assume that all world knowledge is represented in a single semantic network. Within that semantic network, small subgraphs of nodes and links which represent aggregate concepts are explicitly grouped together as conceptual graphs <ref> [Sowa, 1984] </ref>. Individual conceptual graphs are treated the same as primitive nodes|i.e., they can be associated with other nodes via links, and they can themselves be parts of larger conceptual graphs. In the discussion below, conceptual graphs will be referred to merely as "concepts".

Reference-contexts: Both methods showed retrieval time for KDSA growing much more slowly than for standard spreading activation as KB size grows. The theoretical model predicts behavior that is roughly logarithmic in the size of the KB. Detailed presentations of the theoretical and experimental results are published in <ref> [Wolverton, 1994] </ref>.
