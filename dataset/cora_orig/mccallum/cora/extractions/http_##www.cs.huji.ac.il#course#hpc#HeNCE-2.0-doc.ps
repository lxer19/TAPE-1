Abstract: HeNCE, Heterogeneous Network Computing Environment, is a graphical parallel programming environment. HeNCE provides an easy to use interface for creating, compiling, executing, and debugging parallel programs which run under the PVM system which is also described in this document. HeNCE programs can be run on a heterogeneous network of UNIX workstations. This report describes the installation and use of the HeNCE software.

Reference-contexts: HeNCE allows the programmer unfamiliar with parallelism to glue together sequential subroutines with a picture, creating a parallel program. For a more general description of HeNCE see also <ref> [1] </ref>. HeNCE is non-exclusively oriented towards applications in computational science. 3 3 Supported Hardware There are two phases to HeNCE use. First a parallel program must be drawn and annotated. Then, it must be run on a virtual parallel machine.

Reference-contexts: PVM <ref> [2] </ref> is a set of library routines and control programs that allow distributed programs to be created using either "C" or Fortran. Users add calls to PVM routines to otherwise sequential programs to perform tasks such as message passing and process creation.

Reference-contexts: We recommend against obtaining HeNCE and PVM (especially in binary form) from any sites other than ours. 1. Xnetlib. If you have xnetlib <ref> [3] </ref> installed, you can obtain the HeNCE packages using it. Xnetlib is a graphical interface to a large library of software and documents that are of interest to computational scientists. Xnetlib itself can be obtained by means of netlib or by anonymous ftp to ftp.netlib.org. <p> Moreover, changes to a won't affect a [0 : 4] , as they both point to different chunks of memory. HeNCE attempts to perform type conversion as much as possible. Therefore, in the following declaration: 17 NODE 0 NEW &lt;&gt; char a <ref> [3] </ref> = "abc" ; NEW &lt;&gt; int b [3] = a; NEW &lt;&gt; float c [3] = b; NEW &lt;&gt; int d = 3; NEW &lt;&gt; double e = d; null () b will bef97, 98, 99g, c will bef97.0, 98.0, 99.0g and e will be 3.0. 7 Defining a Cost <p> HeNCE attempts to perform type conversion as much as possible.
