Abstract: Architecture level power estimation has received more attention recently because of its efficiency. This article presents a technique used to do power analysis of processors at the architecture level. It provides cycle-by-cycle power consumption data of the architecture based on the instruction/data flow stream. To characterize the power dissipation of control units, a novel hierarchical method has been developed. Using this technique, a power estimator has been implemented for a commercial processor. The accuracy of the estimator has been validated by comparing the power values it produces against measurements made by a gate-level power simulator for the same benchmark set. Our estimation approach has been shown to provide very efficient, accurate power analysis at the architecture level. The energy models built for first pass estimation (such as ALU, MAC unit, register files) are reusable for future architecture design modification. In this article, we have demonstrated the application of the technique. Furthermore, this technique can evaluate various software to achieve hardware/software co-design for low power.
