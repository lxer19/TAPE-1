Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress". To learn the current status of any Internet-Draft, please check the "1id-abstracts.txt" listing contained in the Internet-Drafts Shadow Directories on ftp.is.co.za (Africa), nic.nordu.net (Europe), munnari.oz.au (Pacific Rim), ds.internic.net (US East Coast), or ftp.isi.edu (US West Coast). Distribution of this document is unlimited. Abstract This note describes a profile for the use of the real-time transport protocol (RTP) and the associated control protocol, RTCP, within audio and video multiparticipant conferences with minimal control. It provides interpretations of generic fields within the RTP specification suitable for audio and video conferences. In particular, this document defines a set of default mappings from payload type numbers to encodings.

Reference-contexts: In RTP audio packets, information from lower-numbered channels precedes that from higher-numbered channels. For more than two channels, the convention followed by the AIFF-C audio interchange format should be followed <ref> [1] </ref>. For two-channel stereo, the numbering sequence is left, right; for three channels, left, right, center; for quadrophonic systems, front left, front right, rear left, rear right; for four-channel systems, left, center, right, and surround sound; for six-channel systems left, left center, center, right, right center and surround sound.

Schulzrinne Expires 12/1/95 [Page 3] INTERNET-DRAFT draft-ietf-avt-profile-05.ps July 7, 1995 The packing order for fractional encodings is that described for the IMA Wave types <ref> [2] </ref>. For audio encodings yielding four bits per sample, eight such compressed samples from channel 1 are packet into one 32-bit word, followed by eight compressed samples from channel 2, until all channels have been accomodated and the packing resumes at channel 1. <p> A reference implementation was written by Carsten Borman and Jutta Degener (TU Berlin, Germany) and is available at ftp://ftp.cs.tu-berlin.de/pub/local/kbs/tubmik/gsm/. DVI4: DVI4 is specified, with pseudo-code, in <ref> [2] </ref> as the ADPCM wave type. <p> Sampling rate and channel count are contained in the payload. PCMU: PCMU is specified in CCITT/ITU-T recommendation G.711. Audio data is encoded as eight bits per sample, after companding.

Reference-contexts: However, it is not sufficient to use the video frame rate (typically between 15 and 30 Hz) because that does not provide adequate resolution for typical synchronization requirements when calculating the RTP timestamp corresponding to the NTP timestamp in an RTCP SR packet <ref> [8] </ref>. The timestamp resolution must also be sufficient for the jitter estimate contained in the receiver reports. The standard video encodings and their payload types are listed in Table 5. H.
