Title: Fuzzy classification of spectra

Abstract: Measured spectra are often a composition of a number of basic spectra. The purpose of fuzzy classification is to determine the presence and abundance of the basic spectra in a measured spectrum. In this paper spectra from remote sensing imaging spectrometers with 6 resp. 220 spectral bands are considered each composed of 3 basic spectra from a set of 6 resp. 11 basic spectra. It will be shown that a backpropagation neural network is able to determine the types and abundances of the basic spectra in a mixed spectrum.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Measured spectra are often a composition of a number of basic spectra. In remote sensing, imaging spectrometers <ref> [1] </ref> acquire images simultaneously in many narrow spectral bands from visible to infrared. Due to the limited spatial resolution, a pixel often contains more than one ground cover e.g. grass, mais and a water filled ditch in between.

Reference-contexts: The purpose of fuzzy classification or mixed pixel analysis is to determine the fractions of the ground cover categories (called endmembers) present in each pixel. Usually a linear mixture model <ref> [2] </ref> is used, the signal received for a pixel in band i is assumed to be: s i = P c j=1 f j M ij + e i ; i = 1; 2; :::; n.

Reference-contexts: In classical methods <ref> [3, 4] </ref> the error is assumed to have a multivariate normal distribution with zero mean and covariance matrix N f determined by the covariance matrices of the endmembers: N f = P c j=1 f j N j .

Reference-contexts: Number of pixels in learn and test set per class per spectrometer Pixel spectra from two spectrometers were available, the class of each pixel being determined by ground survey or classification of an image. From a 6 band Landsat image of the Lisbon area in Portugal <ref> [5] </ref> 6 classes were taken. From the 220 band AVIRIS data accompanying the MultiSpec computer program [6] 11 classes were selected. In table 1 the classes and the number of pixels in a learn and a test set are given.

Reference-contexts: Train and test sets are so generated for both spectrometers. As a neural network the multi-layer back-propagation <ref> [7] </ref> net was used. The simulations were performed with our network simulator program, which executes on a PowerXplorer parallel machine and is implemented in C using PVM for communication. Based on our experiences with other applications the following strategies were used.

Reference-contexts: On a sequential machine online learning is usually faster (that is: the weights with best results on the test data are quicker obtained) than epoch learning. On a parallel machine however different parallelization strategies <ref> [8] </ref> can be used for online and (semi-)epoch learning, making the latter faster as less communication operations are needed.
