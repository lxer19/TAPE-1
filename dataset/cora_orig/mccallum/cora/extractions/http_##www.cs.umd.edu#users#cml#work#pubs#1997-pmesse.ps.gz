Reference-contexts: Top-down approaches such as Barry Boehm's Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) <ref> [Boe81] </ref> ask the estimator to supply a size estimate using object points or lines of code, answer a series of questions about product characteristics, and then apply a series of formulas to arrive at a predicted schedule and resource estimate. <p> Bottom-up approaches ask the estimator to define a detailed work-breakdown structure, estimate the cost of the lowest-level tasks, and then sum the estimates (hoping thereby that the errors in the estimates will cancel). There is extensive literature on cost estimation, including <ref> [Boe81, DeM82, BP88] </ref>. Existing approaches, however, do not take business models such as staged contracts into account, and they offer a one-size-fits-all approach to a problem that demands tailored solutions.
