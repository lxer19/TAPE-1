Abstract: The macros described in this paper yield an extension of the L A T E X theorem mechanism. It is designed is to satisfy the different requirements of various journals. Thus, the layout of the "theorems" can be manipulated by determining a "style". This article describes not only the use, but also the definition, of the necessary macros.

Reference-contexts: This mechanism 7 is adopted unchanged from <ref> [2] </ref>; the essential point here is that, for example, in the second case, the arguments Lem, Lemma and section are passed over to the macro "@xnthm. <p> Such a definition will fail whenever a list environment follows immediately. With the above construction, the "mbox-- causes the switch @inlabel (cf. definition of "list and "trivlist in <ref> [2] </ref>) to be set to false and so the following list will insert additional vertical space ("topskip). This is quite annoying. Therefore, we create the line break within the "item.
