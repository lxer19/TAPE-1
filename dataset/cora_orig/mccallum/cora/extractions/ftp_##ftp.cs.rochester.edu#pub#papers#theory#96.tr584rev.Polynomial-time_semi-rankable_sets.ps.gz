Abstract: We study the polynomial-time semi-rankable sets (P-sr), the ranking analog of the P-selective sets. We prove that P-sr is a strict subset of the P-selective sets, and indeed that the two classes differ with respect to closure under complementation, closure under union with P sets, closure under join with P sets, and closure under P-isomorphism. While P=poly is equal to the closure of P-selective sets under polynomial-time Turing reductions, we build a tally set that is not polynomial-time reducible to any P-sr set. We also show that though P-sr falls between the P-rankable and the weakly-P-rankable sets in its inclusiveness, it equals neither of these classes.

Reference-contexts: Although the classes P-sr and P-selective differ with respect to some simple operations, their lowness properties are similar.

Reference-contexts: In the absence of oracles, such a result is currently beyond reach, because it was shown by E. Hemaspaandra, Naik, Ogihara, and Selman [HNOSa] that if P = PP, then every P-selective set is P T equivalent to a tally set and thus is in c EL 2 <ref> [BB86] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Thus the sets in the low hierarchy are those sets in NP that provide no additional power to some level of the polynomial hierarchy, when given as an oracle. To help classify sets that are not in NP, the extended low hierarchy was defined by Balcazar, Book, and Schoning <ref> [BBS86] </ref> as follows: For all k 1, EL k is the class of sets L such that p;L p;LSAT k1 , where A B = f0x j x 2 Ag [ f1x j x 2 Bg. Similarly, one can define intermediate levels, as suggested by Schoning in [Sch86].

Reference-contexts: Though not closed under union or join [HJ], the P-selective sets are clearly closed under union (equivalently, intersection) with P sets, under join with P sets, and under complementation. Also, the P-selective sets are closed under P-isomorphism and, in fact, they are closed under positive Turing reductions <ref> [BTvEB93] </ref>. In contrast, we show that P-sr is not closed under union with P sets, under join with P sets, under complementation, or under P-isomorphism. <p> In particular, though Buhrman, Torenvliet, and van Emde Boas have shown that the P-selective sets are closed under positive Turing reductions <ref> [BTvEB93] </ref>, Theorem 4.2 shows that the P-sr sets are not closed under positive reductions, or indeed even under many-one reductions or honest many-one reductions. It is somewhat surprising that deciding the closure of P-sr under intersection with P sets is a much more difficult problem.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the late 1970s, Selman [Sel79] defined the semi-feasible (i.e., P-selective) sets, which are the polynomial-time analog of the Jockush's [Joc68] semi-recursive sets. Recently, there has been an intense renewal of interest in the P-selective sets and variants of the P-selective sets (see the survey <ref> [DHHT94] </ref>). Among the variants of the P-selective sets that have recently been studied are the membership comparable sets defined by Ogihara [Ogi94b], the nondeterministically selective sets [HNOSb,HHO + 93], and the probabilistically selective sets defined by Wang [Wan].

Reference-contexts: Theorem 4.2 P-sr is not closed under P-isomorphism. Proof: Let b be the function defined inductively by b (0) = 0 and b (i + 1) = 2 2 b (i) . It follows easily from the proof of the main theorem in <ref> [GHS91] </ref> that there is an infinite set H f0 b (0) ; 0 b (1) ; 0 b (2) ; : : :g such that H is in DTIME [2 n ] but no infinite subset of H is in DTIME [2 2 n ].

Reference-contexts: It follows easily from the definitions that P-sr is a superset of the polynomial-time rankable sets of Goldberg and Sipser <ref> [GS91] </ref>, and is a subset of the polynomial-time weakly rankable sets of Hemaspaandra and Rudich [HR90]. We prove that both these inclusions are strict. It follows immediately that all sets in P are polynomial-time semi-rankable if and only if P = P #P . <p> There have been many papers studying the issue of which sets can be ranked [GS91,HR90,BGS91,Huy90]. Definition 2.1 1. <ref> [GS91] </ref> For any set B and any string x, define rank B (x) = jjB x jj. <p> It follows immediately from the definitions that P-rankable P-sr weakly-P-rankable and P-sr P-selective. From this and the result that all P sets are P-rankable if and only if all P sets are weakly-P-rankable if and only if P = P #P ([HR90], see also <ref> [GS91] </ref>), we have the following. Proposition 2.5 All P sets are polynomial-time semi-rankable if and only if P = P #P . Ko proved that all P-selective sets have small circuits (i.e., P-selective P=poly).

Reference-contexts: In light of Theorem 4.2, Proposition 2.4, and the obvious closure under P-isomorphism of the P-selective sets, we immediately have the following. Corollary 4.3 The weakly-P-rankable sets are not closed under P-isomorphism. Corollary 4.3 contrasts with the result of Goldsmith and Homer <ref> [GH95] </ref> that the strongly-P-rankable sets are closed under P-isomorphism if and only if P = P #P . (Similarly, and thus also in contrast to Corollary 4.3, the P-rankable sets are closed under P-isomorphism if and only if P = P #P .) It follows immediately from Theorem 4.2 that the

Reference-contexts: We also observe that the nearly near-testable sets <ref> [HH91] </ref> also lack closure under intersection (equivalently union) with P sets unless P = P #P (equivalently, P = NP = PH = P #P = PP PH ). 1 2 Definitions We let our alphabet, , be f0; 1g. <p> Then A is weakly rankable, but A " ( fl 0 fl ) is not. We claim that NNT, the class of sets having polynomial-time "implicit membership tests," also lacks such minimal closure properties under reasonable complexity-theoretic assumptions. NNT <ref> [HH91] </ref> is the class of all sets A such that A has a polynomial-time computable function f that on each input x states (correctly) either that x 2 A, or that x 62 A, or that exactly one of x and the lexicographical predecessor of x is in A, or that <p> If NNT is closed under intersection with P sets|indeed, under intersection with the very simple set (0 + 1) fl 0|then clearly P = NNT. By combining two results of <ref> [HH91] </ref> (namely, the characterization of OptP|which is now known (see the discussion in [HO94]) to be equivalent to the serializability class [CF91,Ogi94a] SF 2 |in terms of NNT, and the observation regarding the consequences of NNT = OptP) it follows that P = PP PH .

Reference-contexts: Theorem 4.7 There is a tally set that is not polynomial-time Turing reducible to any P-sr set. Proof: We use the following property of the P-selective sets (see <ref> [HHO95] </ref>). Let f be a P-selector function, i.e. a function with the property that for every x; y in fl , f (x; y) 2 fx; yg.

Reference-contexts: Further, we prove that P-sr is a proper refinement of the P-selective sets. Nonetheless, we also prove that the polynomial-time semi-rankable sets remain extremely complex. Though not closed under union or join <ref> [HJ] </ref>, the P-selective sets are clearly closed under union (equivalently, intersection) with P sets, under join with P sets, and under complementation. Also, the P-selective sets are closed under P-isomorphism and, in fact, they are closed under positive Turing reductions [BTvEB93]. <p> P-selective: Structural Comparison Theorem 3.1 shows that the P-sr sets and the P-selective sets are different classes. Yet, one may wonder whether they differ on natural properties. In fact, they differ sharply regarding closure properties. Though Hemaspaandra and Jiang <ref> [HJ] </ref> have noted that the P-selective sets are not closed under union (equivalently, due to closure under complementation, intersection) or join, the P-selective sets clearly are closed under complementation, and under union (equivalently, intersection) with P sets.

Reference-contexts: P-selective sets that have been built in the literature are either P-selective or p m equivalent to a standard left set and, in fact, showing that there is a P-selective set that is not p m equivalent to a standard left set is as hard as showing P 6= PP <ref> [HNOSa] </ref>. In contrast, we observe that standard left cuts that are weakly-rankable are in P. <p> In the absence of oracles, such a result is currently beyond reach, because it was shown by E. Hemaspaandra, Naik, Ogihara, and Selman <ref> [HNOSa] </ref> that if P = PP, then every P-selective set is P T equivalent to a tally set and thus is in c EL 2 [BB86].

Reference-contexts: We assume that all semi-ranking functions discussed henceforward are already in this "oblivious to the ordering of their arguments" form. We review the definitions of the low and extended low hierarchies to which we will refer in the last part of the paper.
