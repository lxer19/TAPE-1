Abstract: A database of course materials in computer architecture is being developed on the WorldWide Web. Its goal is to allow instructors at different institutions to share materials and develop them jointly. This database comprises problems downloaded from the Web sites of courses in computer architecture at universities around the world. The site is searchable by classification or fulltext string for problems on particular topics in computer architecture. At this writing, the database contains 240 problems, and new problems are being added at a rapid pace. In the future, lecture notes and laboratory exercises will also be included. The software is adaptable to other academic fields as well.

Reference-contexts: This could be indicated by giving a pointer to the course Web site. However, an instructor may not be the author of all the questions (s)he uses; if not, some effort should be made to identify the author. When we initially proposed this database three years ago <ref> [Geh 95] </ref>, interest was very high, with four dozen instructors indicating a willingness to participate. But when we began to gather questions in July 1997, hardly anyone followed through. It took weeks to identify even a half dozen authors to get the database started.

Reference-contexts: This database currently contains about 65 courses, of which 10 are on computer architecture. The lead author of this paper has compiled a database of courses in object technology in conjunction with education-oriented workshops at OOPSLA 97 and 98; this material can be found at http://www2.ncsu.edu/eos/project/csc/reuse-workshop/database.html <ref> [Geh 98] </ref>. Currently, information on about 50 courses is included; of these, 25 have Web sites.

Reference-contexts: What we really need is a database which can, given search terms, serve up homework problems, test questions, or lectures on a particular topic. The database The software for the Computer Architecture Course Database is built on top of WWWAssign <ref> [TMB 98] </ref>, a Web-based multimedia exam and homework-grading system developed in the NCSU Physics department using Sybase 11 and a Sun Ultra 2.1 server. This allows us to share the database format and Web accessibility of the physics database.
