Abstract: We present a novel concept, vector restoration, for motion compensated predictive coding of video. Conventional predictive coders generate predictions of the input signal and encode the residual signal. Here, the predicted images are operated upon directly with the goal of restoring the original images at the decoder. The predicted images are processed in a piecewise manner using restoration functions chosen from a codebook. Compression is achieved by transmitting only an index of the chosen restoration function for each image region. We describe the manner in which the restoration functions are generated and chosen. Vector restoration is shown to outperform residual vector quantization and transform-based coders. This superiority is due to vector restorations ability to adaptively exploit the non-trivial correlation between the predicted and residual images.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Motion, or displacement, compensated predictive coders have become the de facto standard for the compression of video signals <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. These coders attempt to exploit the temporal redundancy of video signals by predicting a desired frame from reference frames offset in time. A residual image can then be formed by subtracting the predicted image from the original image. <p> To reduce the computational complexity, this operation will be applied to the predicted signal in a piecewise manner. The main features of vector restoration (VR) based coding are depicted in Fig. 1. A predicted image is generated using any available motion compensated predictive coding technique <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. The input image and predicted image are sectioned into small subimages, and the pixel values of the subimages are listed in vector form. In general, the input and predicted vectors can be constructed from the images in any manner. <p> For this frame VR produced a gain of 1.6 dB over VQ. To evaluate the performance of vector restoration in a more practical situation, we compared VR using separable transforms with residual VQ and with an IP-only MPEG-1 [2] coder, which is comparable to the H.261 <ref> [1] </ref> video telephony standard. Six-bit codebooks were generated using 102598 training vectors from regions of size obtained from two video-conferencing sequences (Mom and Mom and Daughter). A third sequence (Grandmom) was used as the test sequence.

Reference-contexts: A residual image can then be formed by subtracting the predicted image from the original image. The residual signal often is coded by common intraframe coding techniques, such as vector quantization <ref> [3] </ref> or transform coding [4], to exploit spatial redundancy. While displacement compensated predictive coding has been demonstrated to be an effective technique for many applications, conventional methods of residual encoding typically fail to recognize the non-trivial correlation between the residual signal and the predicted signal for practical images. <p> The nearest-neighbor encoding rule can be applied to generate the index such that, (2) An iterative algorithm can be applied to design a codebook of restoration functions from a set of representative training vectors, similar to the well-known Generalized Lloyd Algorithm for vector quantization (VQ) codebook design <ref> [3] </ref>. In each iteration, the training vectors are first partitioned by encoding with the current codebook. Each restoration function in the codebook then is updated by computing the pair, , that minimizes the partial mean-squared error, (3) for the th partition.

Reference-contexts: We shall call this new class of predictive coding techniques restoration based coding. Prior work most closely related to this class of techniques is vector classified adaptive filtering (VCAF), developed by Richardson <ref> [5] </ref>. VCAF was applied to the problem of image restoration, where only a degraded signal and a model of the degradation are available. The selection of the filter was based on the degraded vector and not the original vector, as in vector restoration based coding. 2.

Reference-contexts: Each restoration function in the codebook then is updated by computing the pair, , that minimizes the partial mean-squared error, (3) for the th partition. The solution of this minimization lies within Wiener filter theory <ref> [6] </ref>, which yields, and (4) where , , and respectively denote the con ditional cross and auto-covariance matrices, and the con ditional expectation, with respect to the th partition. These values can be numerically estimated by computing the ensemble averages over the partition.

Reference-contexts: Separable transforms also reduce the number of multiplications and additions that must be performed. The mathematics of separable transforms can be derived similarly to the general case that we have shown. 3. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS Codebooks were generated by modifying VQ codebook splitting techniques <ref> [7] </ref>. The vectors used to train the code-books and the test vectors used to examine the performance of the techniques were independent. The predicted images were generated using block-based techniques with blocks and half-pixel displacement estimation accuracy.
