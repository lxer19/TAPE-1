Abstract: In this section, we provide some intuition on the definitions given in Section 5 and relate them to the agreement protocol of Chandra and Toueg [3] and the E3PC protocol of Keidar and Dolev [7]. Note, however, that this section is intended to give some intuition, and not to cover all possible cases. Both the E3PC and the Chandra and Toueg protocols consist of rounds, each of which, if all goes well, requires 3 phases. In the first phase, the coordinator solicits initial votes from the members; In the second phase, the coordinator suggests a possible decision value to the members, and waits to hear if a majority of these members agree; finally, in the third phase, after receiving approvals from a majority of the members for the value that was suggested, the coordinator can decide, and distribute its decision. Our characterization establishes that such a structure is required in order to bring the system to a configuration in which it is close to deciding on one value and far from deciding on any other value. 2 c processes (other than the coordinator) receive the coordinator's suggestion in any round, then the system is already in a univalent state. Thus, after sending the suggestion, say v, the coordinator's causal cut (the cut of all events that precede the send event) is close to deciding v. Similarly, the causal cut of any member that just received the coordinator's suggestion is also close to deciding v, since if less 2 c processes other then itself before it can make a new proposition. For a future round to become close to a different value u, the coordinator has to receive the vote of at least one member in every minority that was able to bring the system to a v-valent state in the round that was abandoned. Both these protocols give unique numbers to rounds in such a way that if a coordinator receives votes from two members that were in two different rounds, then the vote of the member with the larger round number can be recognized as reflecting a more advanced system state, in the sense of Theorem 5.4, than the vote of the member with the smaller round number. In particular, in both protocols, whenever the coordinator receives votes from members with different round numbers, picks the vote of one of the members whose round number is the than b n
