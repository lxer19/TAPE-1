Abstract: In this paper, a methodology for computation of bounds on MCM and PCB net length and width consistent with timing and noise constraints is proposed. In this method, The initial length and width of each net are used for the AWE-based simulation. For the simulated length and width of the line, the delay and overshoot at receivers are expanded in the form of multi-variable Taylor series of length/width of segments for a multi-pin net. When the resulting linear delay and overshoot functions are bounded by timing and overshoot constraints, the line length and width that satisfy the constraints are obtained by solving a linear programming problem. Computed bounds can be used in practical design to reduce the number of timing and signal integrity violations and shorten the design cycle.

Reference-contexts: Computed bounds can be used in practical design to reduce the number of timing and signal integrity violations and shorten design cycle. 2 Previous Works There are a few publications stating computation of bounds as their goal. In <ref> [1] </ref>, multiple simulations are performed to determine the so-called wiring rules that define the limits of line lengths and loads. [2] and [3] describe a general procedure of conversion from noise and timing constraints into line length. [4] proposes a framework for VLSI interconnection simulation, sensitivity analysis and optimization.
