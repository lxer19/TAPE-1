Abstract: We consider the following problem: given any two convex polygons which are free to translate and rotate arbitrarily in the plane and which have m and n vertices respectively, what is the maximum number of ways they may contact each other such that three independent boundary contacts are made? This problem is similar to several others which have been investigated in the field of combinatorial geometry, such as the polygon containment problem, but has the significant difference that in our context the polygons are allowed to overlap. We present the results of an empirical study of the number of such configurations, and we prove that an upper bound on the total is O(m 3 n 2 + m 2 n 3 ).

Reference-contexts: Our problem is also related to the "polygon containment" problem. There the goal is to determine whether a given polygon will fit inside another. <ref> [Cha83] </ref> proves that this is true if and only if there exists a relative configuration in which three simple contacts are made, and in addition gives an algorithm to compute all such configurations in O (m 3 n 3 (m+n) log (mn)) time for arbitrary polygons of size m and n.

Reference-contexts: In most of the robotics applications, for example, one of the polygons is taken as a model of a mobile robot, while the other models a workspace, and in such a context any overlap represents a non-free configuration and hence does not count. For example, <ref> [LS87] </ref> gives an upper bound of O (mn s (mn)) on the number of independent contact triples (called "critical contacts") for the case of a convex robot P and an arbitrary polygonal environment Q, which may be non-convex and even disconnected, where s is a constant less than or equal to <p> The number of these latter is exactly the question addressed in the present paper. Given any fixed triple of independent simple contacts, it is known that there cannot exist more than 4 relative configurations of P and Q which satisfy all three of them (see e.g. [SS83]; in fact, <ref> [LS87] </ref> conjecture that in fact there can be at most 2 such configura tions). Therefore, a trivial upper bound on K (m; n) is 4 3 2 O (m 3 n 3 ).

Reference-contexts: The details of the algorithm and of its implementation are described in <ref> [PT91] </ref>; here we simply wish to quote the main empirical results from that report. Critical configurations may be classified into different types, depending on the types of the simple contacts which they satisfy. <p> Thus the number of simple contacts was 2 fi 5 fi 7 = 70. The number of a priori possible triples was therefore 3 , which is 54740. By applying the distance constraints (aluded to above and described in detail in <ref> [PT91] </ref>), the number of these which needed to be examined 4 further was 906, or about 1.7%. Of these, only 93 turned out to yield transformations which really placed P on Q in such a way that the three contact constraints were met.

Reference-contexts: a convex robot P and an arbitrary polygonal environment Q, which may be non-convex and even disconnected, where s is a constant less than or equal to 6 and s (q) is an almost linear function known to be in O (q log fl q) for any constant s (see <ref> [Sze74] </ref>). Our problem is also related to the "polygon containment" problem.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [TT89] </ref>, it was shown that the graph of the set of 5 and 4 dimensional strata of the contact space along with their adjacencies is sufficient for solving this contact motion planning problem, and furthermore that this graph has size fi (mn) and can be computed in (optimal) time O (mn),
