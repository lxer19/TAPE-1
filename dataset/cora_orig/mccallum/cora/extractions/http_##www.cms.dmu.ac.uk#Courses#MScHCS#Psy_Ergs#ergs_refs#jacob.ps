Abstract: Current input device taxonomies and other frameworks typically emphasize the mechanical structure of input devices. We suggest that selecting an appropriate input device for an interactive task requires looking beyond the physical structure of devices to the deeper perceptual structure of the task, the device, and the interrelationship between the perceptual structure of the task and the control properties of the device. We affirm that perception is key to understanding performance of multidimensional input devices on multidimensional tasks. We have therefore extended the theory of processing of perceptual structure to graphical interactive tasks and to the control structure of input devices. This allows us to predict task and device combinations that lead to better performance and hypothesize that performance is improved when the perceptual structure of the task matches the control structure of the device. We conducted an experiment in which subjects performed two tasks with different perceptual structures, using two input devices with correspondingly different control structures, a three-dimensional tracker and a mouse. We analyzed both speed and accuracy, as well as the trajectories generated by subjects as they used the unconstrained three-dimensional tracker to perform each task. The results support our hypothesis and confirm the importance of matching the perceptual structure of the task and the control structure of the input device.

Reference-contexts: The subject, however, was allowed to adjust the position of the mouse pad and the button upon the table tops for comfort. The experimenter sat at a terminal to the left rear of the subject. The experiment was conducted in a special purpose laboratory designed for such work <ref> [1] </ref>. Subjects were required to designate a preferred hand and use it to manipulate both devices. Information about handedness and choice of preferred hand was recorded, as was gender of the subject.

Reference-contexts: A multidimensional object is characterized by its attributes. A small red circle has size, color, shape, and location. Investigations into spatial structures that describe the perception of such attributes <ref> [2, 16] </ref> led Garner [10] to observe the attributes of some visual objects combine perceptually to form a unitary whole, while those of other objects remain more distinct and identifiable. Attributes that combine perceptually are said to be integral; those that remain distinct are separable.

Reference-contexts: The taxonomy and model were - 5 - used in an interactive design tool to suggest one or more natural interaction techniques based on a description of an interaction task <ref> [3] </ref>. The model introduces a set of heuristic rules and a pattern matching procedure rather than a more general, theoretical framework, but it highlights the need for such information in the design process.

Reference-contexts: Bleser developed a device taxonomy and input model that explicitly incorporated the physical attributes of input devices, including the notion of the physical separability of input degrees of freedom, and knowledge about task requirements <ref> [4] </ref>. The taxonomy and model were - 5 - used in an interactive design tool to suggest one or more natural interaction techniques based on a description of an interaction task [3].

Reference-contexts: They hid the crucial pragmatic aspects of haptic input by treating devices that output the same information as equivalent, despite the different subjective qualities they present to the user. Buxton recognized the importance of these qualitative differences which he called pragmatic attributes <ref> [5] </ref>. He developed a taxonomy that organized continuous input devices by property (position, motion, pressure) and the number of dimensions. A tablet, light pen, and two-dimensional joystick have two-dimensions and sense position, but they differ from a two-dimensional trackball because it senses motion.

Reference-contexts: The present study provides one example of the development and use of such a theoretical framework to the problem of three-dimensional input devices (as, for example, Card, Moran, and Newell <ref> [6] </ref> have done for two-dimensional pointing devices). To do this, we extend the theory of processing of perceptual structure [9, 10], first developed with fixed images, to interactive graphical manipulation tasks.

Reference-contexts: While this approach can point out that substituting a trackball for a joystick is not equivalent, it does not explain why. Mackinlay, Card, and Robertson expanded Buxton's taxonomy to include most input devices and complex controls <ref> [7, 15] </ref>. One feature of their approach is an evaluation technique for comparing alternative designs in terms of expressiveness (is the meaning exactly conveyed) and effectiveness (is the meaning conveyed with felicity).

Reference-contexts: Foley, Wallace, and Chan's taxonomy of interaction techniques improved upon this concept by adding a middle layer that made explicit the fact that more than one interaction technique may perform a given elementary task <ref> [8] </ref>. However, both approaches considered, for example, selecting with a joystick or trackball equivalent. They hid the crucial pragmatic aspects of haptic input by treating devices that output the same information as equivalent, despite the different subjective qualities they present to the user.

Integral and separable define two classes of perceptual structure that mark the endpoints of a continuum rather than forming a sharp dichotomy. Where an object falls can be determined by two operational methods. <p> The separable task required changing x-y location and the color (lightness or darkness of greyscale). Studies of noninteractive stimuli suggested that position and size are perceived as integral attributes, while position and color are perceived as separable <ref> [10] </ref>. For the integral device, we used the Polhemus tracker which permits input of three integral values. For the separable device, we used a conventional mouse which permits two integral values, to which we added a mode change to enable input of a third, separable, value.

Reference-contexts: Later systems added knowledge about device pragmatics and task requirements to better capture their qualities and use. An early abstraction is that of logical device found in device-independent graphics packages developed from standards such as ACM's Core Graphics System <ref> [11] </ref>. Devices were assigned to - 4 - logical device classes based on how they performed fundamental user actions.

Reference-contexts: To facilitate the latter two analyses, we recorded the position of the mouse or Polhemus approximately every 20 ms. during each trial. All processing and aggregation was conducted after the data collection part of the experiment was completed. The analysis of questionnaire data can be found in <ref> [14] </ref>. Time to End of Trial The first analysis looked at time and accuracy when a subject ended a trial. Time was measured from the appearance of the target until the subject pressed the indicator button.
