Note: Abstract  
Abstract: We consider problems involving robot motion planning in an initially unknown scene of obstacles. The two specific problems that we examine are mapping the scene and searching the scene for a recognizable target whose location is unknown. We use competitive analysis as a tool for comparing algorithms. In the case of convex polygonal obstacles, we show a tight fi(min(k; p k ff)) bound on the competitive factor for these problems, where ff and k are the average aspect ratio and the number of objects, respectively. We also consider the competitive factor for the Nearest Neighbor heuristic.

Reference-contexts: The aspect ratio of a convex polygonal object O is defined to be R=r where R is the radius of the smallest circle that circumscribes O and r is the largest circle that inscribes O <ref> [2] </ref>. The aspect ratio of a scene is defined as the maximum of the aspect ratio of any object in the scene. They also showed that no online algorithm with a constant competitive factor exists if the objects are convex polygons with unbounded aspect ratio. Blum, Raghavan, and Schieber [2] continued <p> O <ref> [2] </ref>. The aspect ratio of a scene is defined as the maximum of the aspect ratio of any object in the scene. They also showed that no online algorithm with a constant competitive factor exists if the objects are convex polygons with unbounded aspect ratio. Blum, Raghavan, and Schieber [2] continued studying the problem of finding an obstacle avoid ing path to a known destination in the plane. <p> One factor that makes it more difficult to navigate is the number of objects in the scene. Another property of the scene that makes searching hard is the aspect ratio of the objects <ref> [10, 2] </ref>. We will thus measure the competitive factor as a function of the number of objects and the aspect ratios of the objects. <p> The average aspect ratio is just the sum of the aspect ratios of the k objects divided by k. In this paper we consider only convex polygonal objects to avoid mazelike scenes <ref> [2] </ref>. We define the function M (k; ff) to be min (k; p In section 2, we construct scenes where ff = fi (ff), and establish a bound of (M (k; ff)), and hence (M (k; ff)), on the competitive factor for searching and mapping.

Reference-contexts: Deng and Papadimitriou [4] originally proposed using competitive analysis to study the mapping problem. The o*ine version of mapping is sometimes called the watchman route problem (see for example <ref> [3] </ref>). 1.3 Summary of Results The ability of the robot to navigate quickly depends on the type of environment that it inhabits. One factor that makes it more difficult to navigate is the number of objects in the scene.

Reference-contexts: Yet, the bound for BNN does not match the lower bound given in section 2. Finally, we present a traversal based algorithm, Tourist, that achieves the optimal competitive factor of fi (M (k; ff)) for searching and mapping. Independently of our investigation, Deng, Kameda and Papadimitriou <ref> [5] </ref> studied mapping in the case of arbitrary polygonal obstacles. Their main result was an O (1)-competitive algorithm for mapping the exterior, or interior, of a simple polygon. Their algorithm is O (k)-competitive algorithm for mapping a scene of k, not necessarily convex, polygonal objects.

Reference-contexts: We can then repeat the above construction with the aspect ratio ff = k. In the case of scenes containing only squares, one can show a lower bound of ( p competitive factor for searching and mapping <ref> [6] </ref>. Similarly, for three dimensional scenes containing cubes one can show a lower bound of (k 2=3 ) [6]. <p> In the case of scenes containing only squares, one can show a lower bound of ( p competitive factor for searching and mapping <ref> [6] </ref>. Similarly, for three dimensional scenes containing cubes one can show a lower bound of (k 2=3 ) [6]. It should be clear from the proof of theorem 2.1 that randomization does not provide any asymptotic benefit for the online algorithm. 3 Nearest Neighbor In this section we analyze the competitive factor of the Nearest Neighbor (NN) heuristic. <p> It would also be interesting to consider extending the results for searching and mapping to nonconvex objects. To correctly capture the hindrance posed by nonconvex objects, or three dimensional objects, one seems to need to introduce a different notion of aspect ratio, which we call resistivity (see <ref> [6] </ref>). An object O is ff resistive if for every pair of points x and y on the boundary of O the shortest path from x to y along the boundary of O is at most ff times the straight line distance between x and y. <p> Since this does not benefit the adversary we we would like to devise a strategy to improve the competitive factor by O (m), where m is the number of robots. Some preliminary results can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>. One could also consider the problem of finding a short path to a known destination in the case of multiple robots. One could also assume that a robot must be close to an object to fully map the object. This is perhaps a more realistic assumption in many situations.

Reference-contexts: This is perhaps a more realistic assumption in many situations. We call the resulting problem the visual traveling salesman problem since the robot must then essentially visit each object. We give a constant competitive algorithm for this problem in <ref> [7] </ref>. This shows that the reason that the competitive factors are so high for mapping is the adversary's ability to map from a distance. 13

Reference-contexts: Blum et al also examined several other aspects of this problem, including allowing more general objects in some cases, randomization, the restriction to tactile robots, and generalization to higher dimensions. In addition, Karloff, Rabani and Ravid <ref> [8] </ref> give an !(1) bound on the competitive factor achievable by randomized algorithms for this problem.

Reference-contexts: that we consider the advantage of competitive analysis, versus worst case analysis, is that competitive analysis is a more expressive measure for the complexity of the online algorithms. 1.2 Previous Results The problems of searching and mapping have been studied extensively in the robot navigation literature ( for example, see <ref> [9, 13] </ref> for current surveys). Yet, there has been no previous work using competitive analysis for the problems that we consider. However, there have been some recent investigations, using competitive analysis, into some related problems that are set in unknown scenes. We now survey these investigations.

Reference-contexts: The cat's goal is to minimize the ratio of the distance that it travels over the shortest path for the mouse. The competitive factor for Hide and Seek in d-dimensional Euclidean space is fi (k (d1)=d )[6]. Hide and seek is similar Raghavan and Snir's Cat and Mouse Game <ref> [11] </ref>. There is a number of obvious ways in which the results in this paper could be extended. There is fi (log k) gap between the lower and upper bounds of Bifold Nearest Neighbor.

Lemma 3.4 Assume that a (k; ff; ff)-scene S fits within an r by r square S. Then the total distance traveled by Nearest Neighbor, starting from the center of S, is O (r log k M (k; ff)).
