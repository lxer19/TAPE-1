Title: Layer Assignment for Yield Enhancement

Abstract: In this paper, two algorithms for layer assignment with the goal of yield enhancement are proposed. In the first, vias in an existing layout are moved in order to decrease its sensitivity to defects. A greedy algorithm for achieving this objective is presented. In the second, we formulate the layer assignment problem as a network bipartitioning problem. By applying the primal-dual algorithm[1] (a variation of the Kernighan-Lin algorithm[2]), the objective of critical area minimization can be achieved. These two methods are applied to a set of benchmark circuits to demonstrate their effectiveness.

Reference-contexts: These proposed layout modification algorithms, however, do not take the number of vias into consideration. Vias have a very important impact on yield. For example, for the defect density reported in <ref> [7] </ref>, the fault probability of a single metal 1 to metal 2 contact (0.266ppm) is equivalent to the probability of a short-circuit type fault in a metal 2 wire segment (4.949/100m) of length 5.5 microns. <p> The costs for the different types of defects used in the examples are: C v = 15, C 1o = C 2o = 1, C 1s = C 2s = 5 <ref> [7] </ref>. To simplify the calculations in the channel routing examples, we use the length of the overlap between wire segments in two adjacent rows or columns to represent the critical area for the short-circuit type faults.

Reference-contexts: The number of vias is determined in the stage of layer assignment, and the objective of layer assignment has traditionally been to minimize the total number of vias in the layout <ref> [8, 9, 10] </ref>. This has been motivated primarily by a need to minimize the manufacturing cost and maximize the reliability of IC circuits. However, the number of vias is not the only factor that affects yield.

Reference-contexts: The layer assignment problem can thus be formulated as a network bipartitioning problem of assigning each cluster to one of the two classes to obtain a minimum cut between these two classes, i.e., Min Cost = X w ij (3) Unfortunately, this graph partitioning problem is NP-complete <ref> [12] </ref>, and a heuristic al gorithm is needed for its solution. It is reported in [13] that the primal-dual algorithm [1], which is a variation of the Kernighan-Lin Algorithm [2], is a better choice than the Fiduccia-Matheyses algorithm [14].

Reference-contexts: This simplification is based on the observation that the diameter x of a defect has a density function f (x) that decreases as 1=x 3 <ref> [17] </ref>, and therefore, the error introduced by ignoring the critical area between non-adjacent wire segments is small. Since in channel routing all wire segments have the same width, we can use the length of the wire segments to represent the critical area for open-circuit type faults.
