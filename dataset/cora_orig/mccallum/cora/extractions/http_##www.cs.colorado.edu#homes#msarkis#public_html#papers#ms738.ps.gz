Abstract: Multilevel Schwarz methods are developed for a conforming finite element approximation of second order elliptic problems. We focus on problems in three dimensions with possibly large jumps in the coefficients across the interface separating the subregions. We establish a condition number estimate for the iterative operator, which is independent of the coefficients, and grows at most as the square of the number of levels. We also characterize a class of distributions of the coefficients, called quasi-monotone, for which the weighted L 2 -projection is stable and for which we can use the standard piecewise linear functions as a coarse space. In this case, we obtain optimal methods, i.e. bounds which are independent of the number of levels and subregions. We also design and analyze multilevel methods with new coarse spaces given by simple explicit formulas. We consider nonuniform meshes and conclude by an analysis of multilevel iterative substructuring methods. 1. Introduction. The purpose of this paper is to develop multilevel

Reference-contexts: Elliptic problems with discontinuous coefficients have solutions with singular behavior. Therefore, in Section 8, we consider nonuniform refinements. We begin with a coarse triangulation that is shape regular and possibly nonuniform and then refine it using a local refinement scheme analyzed by Bornemann and Yserentant <ref> [1] </ref>. We establish a condition number estimate for the iteration operator which is bounded from above by C (1 + `) 2 . For quasi-monotone coefficients, we obtain an optimal multilevel preconditioner. 2. Differential and Finite Element Model Problems. <p> We note, in particular, that solutions of elliptic problems with highly discontinuous coefficients are very likely to become increasingly singular when we approach the wire basket. Nested local refinements have previously been analyzed by Borne-mann and Yserentant <ref> [1] </ref>, Bramble and Pasciak [2], Cheng [7, 8], Oswald [20, 21], and Yserentant [31, 32]. By nested local refinement we mean that an element, which is not refined at level j, cannot be a candidate for further refinement. <p> We note that Assumption 1 guarantees that all elements in T ` fl ( i ) with a common vertex are of comparable size. This type of refinement is exactly the same as that analyzed by Bornemann and Yserentant <ref> [1] </ref>. Let V k fl be the space of piecewise linear functions associated with the triangulation T k fl , which are continuous on and vanish on @. By construction, V k 0 V k+1 fl 0 . The vertices of the elements of T k fl are called nodes. <p> For the local problems with constant coefficients, we use the decomposition given in Bornemann and Yserentant <ref> [1] </ref>. Note that our refinement is a particular case of the local refinement NLR2 considered by Oswald [21]; we can then apply Theorem 6 of Oswald [21] to obtain a good decomposition. <p> The proof is very similar to that of Theorem 6 using now Lemmas 12-16. We note that Lemma 9, for k = 0, holds for a locally quasi-uniform triangulation T 0 fl . We now replace the decomposition (45) by a decomposition analyzed by Bornemann and Yserentant <ref> [1] </ref>, or Oswald [21]. We note that Assumption 1 is needed to prove the first inequality in (46). 9. Multilevel methods on the interface. In this section, we extend our results to multilevel iterative substructuring algorithms for problems with discontinuous coefficients.

Reference-contexts: The multiplicative methods are variants of the multigrid V-cycle method. In our design and analysis, we use a general Schwarz method framework developed in Dryja and Widlund [13, 14, 17], and Dryja, Smith, and Wid-lund [12] for the additive variant, and in Bramble, Pasciak, Xu, and Wang <ref> [4] </ref> for the multiplicative one. Among the particular cases, discussed here, are the BPX algorithm, cf. Bramble, Pasciak and Xu [5], and Xu [30], and the multilevel Schwarz method with one-dimensional subspaces considered by Zhang [33, 34]; see also Dryja and Widlund [15, 16].

Reference-contexts: In Section 5, we study in detail the weighted L 2 projection with weights given by the discontinuous coefficients of the elliptic problem.

Reference-contexts: We consider two classes of the methods, additive and multiplicative. The multiplicative methods are variants of the multigrid V-cycle method. In our design and analysis, we use a general Schwarz method framework developed in Dryja and Widlund [13, 14, 17], and Dryja, Smith, and Wid-lund <ref> [12] </ref> for the additive variant, and in Bramble, Pasciak, Xu, and Wang [4] for the multiplicative one. Among the particular cases, discussed here, are the BPX algorithm, cf. <p> We then design methods with several coarse spaces, sometimes known as exotic coarse spaces; cf. Widlund [28].

The proof of (36) is a direct consequence of Schwarz inequality. The proof of (37) is related to the proof of (32). To get the seminorm bound in (34), we use the same arguments as for (33).

Special coefficients and an optimal algorithm. <p> However, we can define new exotic coarse spaces, denoted by V ~ X 1 , with ~ X = ~ F ; ~ E; g N N; and ~ W by introducing approximate discrete harmonic extensions. They are given by simple explicit formulas <ref> [12, 22] </ref> and have the same H 1 stability estimates as the discrete harmonic extensions. Here we use strongly the fact that our exotic spaces V ~ X 1 have constant values at the nodal points of the faces of the substructures. <p> p p p p q q q A A A q S C Q E k1 E k3 To approximate the discrete harmonic function F ij in i , we use the finite element function # F ij introduced in the proof of Lemma 4.4 of Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [12] </ref> (see also Extension 3 in Sarkis [22]), given by (see Fig. 3). Definition 3. <p> Note that # F ij 2 V h 0 , and F ij @ i We remark that other extensions are also possible; see, e.g., Extension 2 of [22].

Nonuniform refinements. We now consider finite element approximation with locally nested refinement. Such refinements can be used to improve the accuracy of the solutions of problems with singular behavior which arise in elliptic problems with discontinuous coefficients, nonconvex domains, or singular data. <p> For the proof of the first inequality, we use Assumption 1 and the inverse inequality. For the second inequality, we use that V ` fl ( i ) V ` ( i ) and then apply a standard Sobolev type inequality (see Lemma 4.3 of <ref> [12] </ref>). <p> Proof. The first inequality is trivial since the discrete harmonic function has minimal energy. For the second inequality, we use the same ideas as in Lemma 4.4 of Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [12] </ref>. Assumption 1 is crucial in this proof. 2 We denote by V ` fl (@ i ) the restriction of V ` fl ( i ) to @ i . <p> Using the same ideas as in Lemma 4.4 of Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [12] </ref>, we obtain 34 Lemma 15.

Let F ij be the discrete harmonic function, defined in i , which equals 1 on F ij;h and zero on @ i;h nF ij;h . Using Lemma 3 of Dryja and Widlund <ref> [17] </ref>, which is an inequality for H 1=2 00 (F ij ), and Poincare's inequality, we obtain i k (u u h H 1=2 i k (I h ( F ij (u u h i k (I h ( F ij (u u h and using Lemma 4.5 of Dryja, Smith, <p> Lemma 5.

For different values of fi, we use an argument similar to that of the proof of Lemma 2; cf. also Sarkis [22]. Returning to the proof of Theorem 2, we find that (23) follows from Corollary 1, and Lemmas 1 and 5. <p> This has been established in Remark 3:3 in Zhang [34]. 2 Remark 1.
