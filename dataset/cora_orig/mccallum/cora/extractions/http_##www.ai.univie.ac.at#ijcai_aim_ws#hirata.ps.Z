Abstract: The aim of this research is to provide a formalization method for the musical concepts and entities observed in scores and texts, that is, musical knowledge. As a first step, the knowledge domain of the research is restricted to a jazz piano solo performance, and the knowledge activities of a jazz pianist are represented using the deductive object-oriented (DOO) method. The advantages of the DOO method bring about that musical knowledge is systematized by a partial ordering, the flexible object representation makes it possible to manipulate musical knowledge incrementally, and the rules in a clausal form realizes useful and complicated functions, such as property inheritance, similarity and deductive inference. First, this paper shows a sample problem that the transcription of an actual solo performance by a jazz pianist is presented, explained, and analyzed. We are motivated to formalize the various musical knowledge appearing in the sample problem. From the sample problem, the observation that the piano performance analysis consists of abstraction and association is obtained. In the DOO framework, the abstraction relation can be naturally represented by a partial order v, and the association by connecting different musical concepts to each other. The author is prototyping a musical knowledge base system employing the formalization method presented in this paper. The proto

Reference-contexts: As a starting point, the transcription of an actual solo performance by a jazz pianist is presented, explained, and analyzed <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> . Once the musical knowledge contained in these materials is extracted and represented using the DOO method, we can treat the knowledge in a formal way. <p> That allows useful operations, such as associative retrieving, analogy, belief revision, nonstandard reasoning and inductive learning, to be easily designed and implemented. 2 Sample Problem a jazz pianist; the tune title is Autumn Leaves <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> . The pianist added the following comment to his performance: The voicing of C m7 does not belong to the conventional 3rd-build system 1 . It has three perfect 4th intervals (C5 F 5 B [ 5 E [ 6).
