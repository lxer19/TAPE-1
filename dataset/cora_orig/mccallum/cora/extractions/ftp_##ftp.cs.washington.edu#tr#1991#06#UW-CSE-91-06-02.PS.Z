Reference-contexts: The problem for undi rected graphs (ustcon) is complete for the seemingly weaker "symmetric" variant of nondeterministic space bounded machines [18], and is known to be solvable by logarithmic space and polynomial time bounded randomized algorithms, even errorless ones <ref> [1, 7] </ref>. Any problem solvable deterministically in logarithmic space can be reduced to either stcon or ustcon | i.e., both are DLOG-hard [18, 22]. The fundamental open problem in this area remains whether deterministic, nondeterministic, and probabilistic space bounded complexity classes are equal or distinct. <p> This paper presents new upper bounds 2 for the problem. For probabilistic algorithms, much is known about the simultaneous time and space requirements for ustcon. The random walk result of Aleliunas, Karp, Lipton, Lovasz, and Rackoff <ref> [1] </ref> provides a space-optimal, but somewhat slow algorithm for ustcon. At the other extreme, well-known deterministic methods like depth- and breadth-first search provide time-optimal, but space-intensive solutions. Both extremes exhibit a time-space product of O (mn log n). <p> In addi tion, there is one sublinear space deterministic algorithm for ustcon that does not also solve stcon. Nisan [19], improving on results of Babai, Nisan and Szegedy [3], has shown how to "derandomize" the probabilistic algorithm of Aleliunas, et al. <ref> [1] </ref> to obtain a small-space deterministic algorithm for ustcon. It again has essentially the same performance as Sav-itch's: very small space, namely fi (log 2 n), but superpolynomial time, namely n fi (log n) .

Reference-contexts: For undirected s-t connectivity, all of the algorithms cited in the previous paragraph apply as well, with the same complexity bounds. In addi tion, there is one sublinear space deterministic algorithm for ustcon that does not also solve stcon. Nisan [19], improving on results of Babai, Nisan and Szegedy <ref> [3] </ref>, has shown how to "derandomize" the probabilistic algorithm of Aleliunas, et al. [1] to obtain a small-space deterministic algorithm for ustcon. It again has essentially the same performance as Sav-itch's: very small space, namely fi (log 2 n), but superpolynomial time, namely n fi (log n) . <p> Using an extension of work by Babai, Nisan and Segedy <ref> [3] </ref> and Nisan [19] on pseudorandom generators, he shows that polynomial time and O (log 2 n) space are simultaneously achievable. Note that the space bound for his algorithm is again fi (log 2 n), making the second open question all the more intriguing.

Reference-contexts: When s = fi (n log n), the time bound is O ((m + n) log n), only a factor of log n worse than the time-optimal bound of depth- and breadth-first search. As noted in Bar Noy, et al. <ref> [4] </ref>, no previously known deterministic algorithm for ustcon simultaneously achieves polynomial time and sublinear space.

Reference-contexts: At the other extreme, well-known deterministic methods like depth- and breadth-first search provide time-optimal, but space-intensive solutions. Both extremes exhibit a time-space product of O (mn log n). The probabilistic algorithm of Broder, Karlin, Raghavan, and Upfal <ref> [10] </ref> provides a spectrum of compromises roughly between these two extremes: time O (m 2 log 5 n=s) with space s. For deterministic algorithms, less is known. For directed graphs, depth-and breadth-first search are still applicable, still time-optimal, and still require space fi (n log n) in the worst case. <p> None of these results provides the sort of spectrum of compromises between time and space that Broder, et al. <ref> [10] </ref> give. The main results of our paper are three new deterministic algorithms for undirected s-t connectivity that achieve sublinear space and polynomial time simultaneously. <p> This is off by a factor of at most n log n from the best known algorithms (depth-first or breadth-first search, and random walk; see Broder et al. <ref> [10] </ref>), and a factor of n when the space approaches its upper bound (O (n log n)). In summary, we have shown the following.

Reference-contexts: A fruitful intermediate step is to explore time-space tradeoffs for the problem: the simultaneous time and space requirements of algorithms for ustcon. Even for this simpler intermediate problem, no nontrivial lower bounds are known for general models of computation (such as Turing machines), although Cook and Rackoff <ref> [11] </ref> and Beame, et al. [6] have obtained lower bounds for restricted models. This paper presents new upper bounds 2 for the problem. For probabilistic algorithms, much is known about the simultaneous time and space requirements for ustcon. <p> Savitch's Theorem [22] provides a deterministic fi (log 2 n) space algorithm for stcon, but it requires time exponential in its space bound: n fi (log n) . A similar but more subtle algorithm by Cook and Rackoff <ref> [11] </ref> for their more restricted "JAG" model has essentially the same performance. No sublinear space, polynomial time algorithm is known for stcon, and there is evidence suggesting that none is possible. Specifically, Tompa [24] has shown that certain natural approaches to solving stcon admit no such solution.

Reference-contexts: Instead, our bounded breadth-first search routine looks up the endpoint of the edge in the list of vertices already known to be in the neighborhood. Lookup and insertion in a list can be accomplished in time O (log b) by using a balanced search tree <ref> [16] </ref>. Thus, overall, bbfs uses time O (b 2 log b) with O (b) registers | it can explore only b vertices, which can have only O (b 2 ) edges among them.

Reference-contexts: Also, there is one algorithm solving a restricted case of ustcon in O (log 2 n= log log n) space, namely the case of undirected graphs of (log n)- 3 bounded genus, solved by Kriegel <ref> [17] </ref>. None of these results provides the sort of spectrum of compromises between time and space that Broder, et al. [10] give. The main results of our paper are three new deterministic algorithms for undirected s-t connectivity that achieve sublinear space and polynomial time simultaneously.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the s-t connectivity problem for directed graphs (stcon) is the prototypical complete problem for nondeterministic logarithmic space [22].

The complexity of ustcon sits squarely in the middle of this question.

Reference-contexts: space bound, can our time bound be improved? Second, can the space bound for undirected s-t connectivity be reduced to o (log 2 n), i.e., can Sav-itch's Theorem be bettered for undirected graphs? Third, are sublinear space and polynomial time simultaneously achievable for directed s-t connectivity? Recent work by Nisan <ref> [20] </ref> has made surprising progress on the first question. Using an extension of work by Babai, Nisan and Segedy [3] and Nisan [19] on pseudorandom generators, he shows that polynomial time and O (log 2 n) space are simultaneously achievable.

Reference-contexts: Let bbfs (v; b) denote this set, and define a full neighborhood to be one that contains b vertices. All our algorithms depend on repeatedly recomputing the neighborhoods of vertices; such recomputation is common when attempting to use a limited amount of space. (See <ref> [21] </ref>, for example). Using the bbfs routine, a few special cases can be eliminated with a little initial work. Begin by generating the neighborhoods of s and t. If they intersect, we are finished: s and t are connected. Next, check that both neighborhoods are full.

Reference-contexts: In computational complexity theory, it has an additional significance: understanding its complexity is a key to understanding the relationships among deterministic, nondeterministic, and probabilistic space bounded complexity classes. In particular, the s-t connectivity problem for directed graphs (stcon) is the prototypical complete problem for nondeterministic logarithmic space <ref> [22] </ref>. The problem for undi rected graphs (ustcon) is complete for the seemingly weaker "symmetric" variant of nondeterministic space bounded machines [18], and is known to be solvable by logarithmic space and polynomial time bounded randomized algorithms, even errorless ones [1, 7]. <p> Any problem solvable deterministically in logarithmic space can be reduced to either stcon or ustcon | i.e., both are DLOG-hard <ref> [18, 22] </ref>.

The complexity of ustcon sits squarely in the middle of this question. <p> For deterministic algorithms, less is known. For directed graphs, depth-and breadth-first search are still applicable, still time-optimal, and still require space fi (n log n) in the worst case. Savitch's Theorem <ref> [22] </ref> provides a deterministic fi (log 2 n) space algorithm for stcon, but it requires time exponential in its space bound: n fi (log n) . A similar but more subtle algorithm by Cook and Rackoff [11] for their more restricted "JAG" model has essentially the same performance. <p> When the recursive algorithm is taken to extremes, its time and space bounds resemble those for Savitch's result <ref> [22] </ref>. The lower limit for the space 23 used by the algorithm is reached when * = 1= log n. With this low value for *, the algorithm uses space O (log 2 n) and time n O (log n) , similar to Savitch's space and time bounds [22]. <p> Savitch's result <ref> [22] </ref>. The lower limit for the space 23 used by the algorithm is reached when * = 1= log n. With this low value for *, the algorithm uses space O (log 2 n) and time n O (log n) , similar to Savitch's space and time bounds [22]. There are three obvious open questions about s-t connectivity.

Reference-contexts: The sets can be manipulated efficiently using Union-Find subroutines with weighted union and path compression <ref> [23] </ref>. We will call these sets union-find sets. Begin by constructing a singleton set containing each landmark, plus an extra set containing the special value "small". For all the edges e = fu; vg, perform a Union on Find (cl (u)) and Find (cl (v)). <p> The loop to find the landmarks takes time O (b 2 ln log b), using O (b + l) registers. The Union-Find operations take time O (mff (m)) <ref> [23] </ref> and use O (l) registers. The cl routine is called 2m times, each call taking time O (b 2 l log b), so, assuming m = (n), connecting the union-find sets dominates the algorithm's running time, taking time O (b 2 lm log b).

Specifically, Tompa <ref> [24] </ref> has shown that certain natural approaches to solving stcon admit no such solution. Indeed, he shows that for these approaches, performance degrades sharply with decreasing space: space o (n) implies time n (log n) , essentially as slow as Savitch's algorithm.

Reference-contexts: This method would fail miserably were the graph directed. However, studying stcon in another context, Ullman and Yannakakis <ref> [26] </ref> employed vaguely similar techniques involving multiple small searches, so generalization of our methods to directed graphs is not out of the question. 6 Acknowledgements We thank Simon Kahan, who presented a similar problem that led to our discussion of this one.
