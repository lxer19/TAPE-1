Abstract: This paper describes a computational case-based model for the creative planning process. Our approach is inspired in Wallas model for the creative process in that we consider that creativity involves a sequence of four stages: preparation, incubation, illumination and verification. Preparation includes problem acquisition and assimilation of background knowledge, which is represented by cases, i.e., documented past experiences. With the aim of achieving a flexible knowledge representation, as a means to potentiate specific creative abilities like Fluency, Synthesis and Analysis , we structure each case as a network of hierarchically and temporally related case pieces. These case pieces can be considered individually, providing better recombinations of them. These recombinations, rather than made by chance, are guided by those hierarchical and temporal case piece relations (or explanations). We explain the role of opportunistic knowledge acquisition at the incubation stage. We sustain that illumination may comprise recursive calls of the sequence of the first three stages. This computational model is implemented in the system INSPIRER ( ImagiNation 1 taking as Source Past and Imperfectly RElated Reasonings). An application in musical composition domain is presented. We also show how a musical composition task may be cognitively modelled and treated as a planning task. We also present a short example illustrating how

Reference-contexts: During this phase, t he problem is being unconsciously pursued and the flexibly organised background knowledge, acquired during the anterior phase, is being restructured into new schemata, i.e., new mental structures are created by recombinations and reorderings of the original knowledge <ref> ( Armbruster, 1989) </ref>. In our approach, this process of recombination of knowledge fragments is performed in the following way.

Reference-contexts: Our approach for creativity We think that creativity is characterised by a connection, combination, association or integration of different (and possibly contrary) things in the same product (the creative product) directly or using metaphoric and analogic techniques. However, to be considered creative, the product must be <ref> (Cabezas, 1993) </ref>: I. novel, i.e., not common, not conventional and not frequent. E.g., the Copernicuss theory was a new scientific product, which no one proposed before; II. unpredictable, i.e., creativity activity uses and changes in an unpredictable way what already exists.

Reference-contexts: However, everybody seems to agree that one cannot originate new things out of nothing. Besides originality, valuability is also refer red by the authors as an important characteristic of a creative product <ref> ( Ibez, 1991) </ref>. Cabezas (1993), for instance, states that creativity results from the combination of previous ideas, experiences, elements, phenomena, images, realities, etc., in a new, original and useful way.
