Reference-contexts: A first study has demonstrated the feasibility on a mockup of this code called Thyc-1D (see <ref> [1, 2] </ref> for more details). Two difficulties have been encountered in differentiating Thyc-1D and Thyc-3D. First, the program has black-box subroutines, whose code is not available.
