Abstract: We consider the standard Quicksort algorithm that sorts n distinct keys with all possible n! orderings of keys being equally likely. Equivalently, we analyze the total path length L n in a randomly built binary search tree. Obtaining the limiting distribution of L n is still an outstanding open problem. In this paper, we establish an integral equation for the probability density of the number of comparisons L n . Then, we investigate the large deviations of L n . We shall show that the left tail of the limiting distribution is much "thinner" (i.e., double exponential) than the right tail (which is only exponential). Our results contain some constants that must be determined numerically. We use asymptotic methods of applied mathematics such as the WKB method and matched asymptotics. fl The work of this author was supported by NSF Grant DMS-93-00136 and DOE Grant DE-FG02-93ER25168.

Reference-contexts: In Section 3, we analyze (4) asymptotically for n ! 1 and for various ranges of u. We use asymptotic methods of applied mathematics, such as the WKB method and matched asymptotics <ref> [2, 6] </ref>. The most important scale is where n ! 1 with u 1 = O (n 1 ), which corresponds to k = E [L n ] + O (n) = 2n log n + O (n). Most of the probability mass is concentrated in this range of k.
