Abstract: When mining large databases, the data extraction problem and the interface between the database and data mining algorithm become important issues. Rather than giving a mining algorithm full access to a database (by extracting to a flat file or other directly-accessible data structure), we propose the SQL Interface Protocol (SIP), which is a framework for interaction between a mining algorithm and a database. The data continues to reside entirely within the database management system (DBMS), but the query interface to the database gives the data mining algorithm sufficient information to discover the same patterns it would have found with direct access to the data. This model of interaction brings several advantages; for example, it allows a mining algorithm to be parallelized automatically just by using a parallelized DBMS to answer queries. We show how two families of mining algorithms may be implemented as "SIPpers," and we discuss related work in databases that should further enhance performance in the future.

Reference-contexts: The inspiration for the SQL interface protocol was the statistical query model of learning <ref> (Kearns 1993) </ref>. Any mining algorithm that fits the statistical query model will be SIP-compliant. The idea that most classification tree splitting criteria are based on simple probability estimates is described in John (1996).

Reference-contexts: Whang, Kim & Wieder-hold (1994) explore the multi-level grid file method for precomputing and incrementally updating multidimensional counts, which is logarithmic in the number of attributes. Slower but more exact methods for precomputing and updating statistics are studied in statistical databases <ref> (Michalewicz 1992) </ref>. Most of the top DBMS vendors have parallelized their systems. With a clean and modular interface between the mining components and the relational DBMS, performance benefits realized by the DBMS will immediately benefit the mining process as well.

Reference-contexts: This obviates the need for flat file extracts, but is otherwise uninteresting and is not in the spirit of the SIP framework. We will next discuss the C4.5 <ref> (Quinlan 1993) </ref> classification tree algorithm and the simple Bayesian classifier, two examples of algorithms that can be implemented as SIPpers.
