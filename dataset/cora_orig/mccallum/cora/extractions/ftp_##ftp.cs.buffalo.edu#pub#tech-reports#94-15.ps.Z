Title: On the impossibility of amplifying the independence of random variables (Extended Abstract)  
Author: Jin-yi Cai Suresh Chari 
Abstract: In this paper we prove improved lower and upper bounds on the size of sample spaces which are required to be independent on specified neighborhoods. Our new constructions yield sample spaces whose size is smaller than previous constructions due to Schulman[8]. Our lower bounds generalize the known lower bounds of [1, 3, 2]. In obtaining these bounds we examine the possibilities and limitations of amplifying limited independence by fixed functions. We show that in general independence can not be amplified from k-wise independence to (k + 1)-wise independence. Finally, we enumerate all possible logical consequences of pair-wise independent random bits.

Reference-contexts: We improve the lower bound to show that jSj -(G), where -(G) is the function defined by Lovasz <ref> [6] </ref> to approximate the Shannon capacity of graphs. We also show that there exists a sample space of size (G) where (G) is the chromatic number of G. <p> Thus, S satisfies all the pairwise independence constraints specified by G (n). We now show that a lower bound for S (n; 2; m; d) is provided by the following interesting function of Lovasz <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> Thus, (u 1 ; : : : ; u n ) is an orthonormal representation for G with each vector of dimension jSj. The lower bound follows from the fact that if G admits a dimension d orthonormal representation then -(G) d <ref> [6] </ref>. 2 Now consider the case k &gt; 2. Let N 1 ; : : : ; N m be the neighborhoods over which we want independence. <p> This generalizes the lower bounds of [1, 2, 3] since if we need independence in all k sized neighborhoods, then G n;k has a clique of size n n and for all graphs G, -(G) !(G) <ref> [6] </ref>, where !(G) is the clique number of G.
