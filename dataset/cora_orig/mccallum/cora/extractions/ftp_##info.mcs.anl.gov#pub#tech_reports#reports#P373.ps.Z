Abstract: A basic objective in computational fluid dynamics is the efficient solution of nonlinear systems of equations that arise in finite element modeling of convective-diffusive flow. The use of implicit Newton-like schemes to solve the coupled system of Navier-Stokes and continuity equations enables rapid convergence, although the well-known difficulty of indirect pressure linkage requires attention when forming the Jacobian matrices. Traditional approaches for overcoming this obstacle include reordering strategies, modification of diagonal terms, and changes of variables. In contrast, we develop a primitive variable finite element formulation which employs an auxiliary pressure equation derived from the Navier-Stokes and continuity equations. This formulation extends the work of Rice and Schnipke, where a similar equation was developed in the context of a segregated solution method. Approximate Newton methods using the new finite element formulation are evaluated in terms of accuracy, convergence rate, and overall efficiency for flow problems with varying degrees of nonlinearity.

Reference-contexts: We consider explicit formation of the Jacobian matrix both analytically and with the use of finite differencing approximations. Development of the subsidiary pressure equation extends the finite element work of Rice and Schnipke <ref> [1] </ref>, which is itself based on the SIMPLER finite difference technique of Patankar [2], where similar equations are derived within the context of a segregated solution approach. <p> The resulting discretized pressure equation is symmetric positive definite, and equal-order interpolation functions can be employed for all variables instead of the usual lower-order interpolation for pressure. As shown by Rice and Schnipke <ref> [1] </ref>, the segregated solution variant of this problem formulation eliminates spurious pressure modes that often arise for simple multilinear elements when constant pressures would be required to satisfy the Babuska-Brezzi stability condition. <p> This is the case for all problems considered in this work. 2.3 Derivation of the Auxiliary Pressure Equation We extend the segregated velocity-pressure approach of Rice and Schnipke <ref> [1] </ref> to derive the new pressure equation. As previously discussed, the method of 9 weighted residuals is employed to discretize the momentum eqs. (2.2). We next turn to the continuity eq. (2.1), by which pressure is indirectly determined. <p> by OE i = a ii B @ l=1 (a il OE l ) + ^ f j i C A ; i = 1; : : : ; n: (2:39) Note that the algebraic form of the partial velocities developed in the segregated solution approach of Rice and Schnipke <ref> [1] </ref> is retained, although the intermediate linearized momentum systems are not solved to obtain trial velocities for use in the row sums. 3 Formation of the Jacobian Matrix We next consider analytic formation of the Jacobian matrix corresponding to (2.6), which is given by F 0 (w) = A (w) + <p> Of particular interest is a comparison between the Newton-like schemes and the segregated solution approach of Rice and Schnipke <ref> [1] </ref>, since the velocity-pressure formulations of the two approaches are closely related. <p> No slip boundary conditions are given for the top wall, and a symmetry condition exists at the bottom of the grid. These test cases are similar to cases considered by Rice and Schnipke <ref> [1] </ref> and Gosman et al. [10] as well as various other researchers, and are presented for benchmark comparisons of flow features. The meshes DUCT1 and DUCT2 are employed, which respectively have the dimensions of 7fi61 and 11fi181. <p> The meshes DUCT1 and DUCT2 are employed, which respectively have the dimensions of 7fi61 and 11fi181. We examine isothermal flow over a backward-facing step, where the problem and mesh geometry are adapted from Rice and Schnipke <ref> [1] </ref> and Gartling [11]. Although the problem geometry is simple, the flow exhibits complex features that are found in many other cases of practical interest. <p> Differences between solutions obtained by the segregated solution technique and the approximate Newton method fluctuate only according to the specified strictness of the convergence criteria. Key flow features agree with those discussed by Rice and Schnipke <ref> [1] </ref>, Gosman et al. [10], and Armaly et al. [12]. The new velocity-pressure-temperature formulation overcomes the difficulty of indirect pressure linkage inherent in the coupled system of Navier-Stokes and continuity equations.

Development of the subsidiary pressure equation extends the finite element work of Rice and Schnipke [1], which is itself based on the SIMPLER finite difference technique of Patankar <ref> [2] </ref>, where similar equations are derived within the context of a segregated solution approach. As described, for example, by Chorin [3], a distinguishing characteristic of segregated solution methods is that the governing partial differential equations are repeatedly solved in sequence rather than concurrently. <p> Damping is required within the approximate Newton approach only for solution of the natural convection problem with a Raleigh number of 10 6 . 19 Within the segregated solver a variable-band Cholesky factorization method [17] is used to solve the symmetric pressure equation. In addition, a tridiagonal matrix algorithm <ref> [2] </ref>, [14] is employed for the momentum equations. Our experiments indicate that for all test problems the approximate New-ton method, using the velocity-pressure formulation discussed in Section 2, determines the flow solution both rapidly and accurately.

As described, for example, by Chorin <ref> [3] </ref>, a distinguishing characteristic of segregated solution methods is that the governing partial differential equations are repeatedly solved in sequence rather than concurrently. This feature offers the advantage of relatively modest memory requirements, since the coefficient matrix for only one linearized system 2 must be stored at a given time.

Reference-contexts: In addition, since the segregated solution approach reduces the residual only locally at each step, the number of iterations required for convergence and the computational effort tend to increase significantly as grids are refined (see, e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>). We maintain the favorable features of the Rice-Schnipke finite element formulation and incorporate the benefits of solving a fully coupled nonlinear system in which the residual is reduced globally at each iteration. <p> This approach is particularly useful for finely discretized problems with high degrees of nonlinearity. As discussed by MacArthur and Patankar <ref> [4] </ref>, since the segregated solver reduces the residual only locally at each step of the solution process, its convergence rate is strongly influenced by the number of unknowns. In addition, the decoupling inherent in the segregated solver causes relatively slow transmission of boundary data throughout the problem domain.
