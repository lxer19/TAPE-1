Abstract: Image Database Management Systems (IDBMS) aim to store large collections of images, and to support efficient content-based retrieval. In this paper we explore the idea of image data modeling as a tool for describing image domains, with the twofold objectives of guiding feature extraction and incorporating semantics into the extracted summaries of images. We discuss the implementation of these ideas in the PIQ image DBMS, and demonstrate that significat gains in the expressiveness of content-based queries can be achieved. Image Database Management Systems (IDBMS) aim to store large collections of images, and to support efficient content-based retrieval of the images. Like any other DBMS, an IDBMS has a storage facility, the data is arranged according to some data model, and it has a query facility. The main IDBMS issue this paper explores is the data model and its impact on the expressiveness of the query language. The kind of queries we focus on are selection queries. In other words, we want to select a few images from the database, based on their content. Imagine a query facility that loads all the images from the database and checks each image to see if it fits the selection criterion. In all but extreme cases this query facility would be inefficient. The only other option is to have more information about the images stored in the database so it can be used for evaluating the selection criterion. We call this extra information a summary. When an image is stored in the database, its summary is stored as well. Queries are executed using only the information in the summaries. Images are retrieved only after we check that the summary conforms to the selection criterion. This means that any content information we want to query must be in the summary. Therefore, the expressiveness of any IDBMS query language is limited by the type of information in the summary. Note that every existing IDBMS uses the idea of a summary for query optimization and execution. Some systems create the summaries automatically when an image is inserted into the database. Other systems need the help of a user in constructing the summary. User supplied input on a per-image basis has dire consequences on the system's ability to scale. One can't expect a user to provide input for many thousands of images. Therefore, a system capable of handling large collections of images must have automated summary construction (which includes feature extraction). Copyright 1996 IEEE.

Reference-contexts: The type of information in the summary is determined at the time the system is built and can't be changed. Images in a given specialized domain have much in common. This commonality is reflected in the type of information put in summaries. For example, the VIMS (or VIMSYS) <ref> [1, 3] </ref> system can handle only images of frontal views of single Human faces. The type of information in the summaries fits this image domain. A special feature extraction algorithm was constructed so that summaries can be created automatically.

Reference-contexts: This means that the type of information that can be extracted automatically must be relevant to every possible image. This excludes any notion of semantic content of the information in the summaries. QBIC <ref> [4, 2] </ref> is an example for such a system. When an image is inserted with no user-supplied input, the system extracts two features of the image: a color histogram, and a condensed edge map that represents the layout of the image. <p> This point seems trivial, but it is the cause of major limitations to the leading IDBMSs such as QBIC <ref> [4, 2] </ref> and Photobook [5]. In the case of PIQ, one can create schemas, thereby determining what information in the images is important. In this case the true limit to the expressiveness of queries is the query language and query processing facility.

Reference-contexts: PIQ differs from existing IDBMSs by being able to handle different specialized domains. We introduce the idea of image data modeling as a remedy to the problems listed above. Data modeling is used for describing the contents of images of a specific image domain. In <ref> [7, 6] </ref> we show how the PIQ data model is used for automated feature extraction. <p> Then, for every image, the summary of the image will contain a value for eye-color (e.g. blue). The values of summaries are generated by an automated feature extraction facility (see <ref> [7, 6] </ref>). It is important to note a fundamental aspect of PIQ: the DBMS does feature extraction and organizes the resulting summary information, in order to store, index and query this information efficiently. <p> The set of leaf node types is dynamic. Whenever we have some feature extraction algorithm we want to use, we can define a new leaf node type for it. Thus, the system's data model can be extended. For more details on DDL guided feature extraction see <ref> [7, 6] </ref>. Internal nodes of a schema tree represent operations done on the objects associated with the children of that node. Those types are: Union. The object referred to by a node whose type is Union is the union of the objects referred to by the node's children.
