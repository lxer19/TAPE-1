Title: Protecting Routing Infrastructures from Denial of Service Using Cooperative Intrusion Detection

Abstract: We present a solution to the denial of service problem for routing infrastructures. When a network suffers from denial of service, packets cannot reach their destinations. Existing routing protocols are not well-equipped to deal with denial of service; a misbehaving router|which may be caused by software/hardware faults, misconfiguration, or malicious attacks|may be able to disable entire networks. To protect network infrastructures from routers that incorrectly drop packets and misroute packets, we hypothesize failure models for routers and present protocols that detect and respond to those misbehaving routers. Based on realistic assumptions, we prove that our protocols have the following properties: (1) A well-behaved router never incorrectly claims another router as a misbehaving router; (2) If a network has misbehaving routers, one or more of them can be located; (3) Misbehaving routers will eventually be removed.

Reference-contexts: We view intrusion detection as the second line of defense. To the best of our knowledge, no work has been published on intrusion detection in routing infrastructures. Moreover, very little intrusion detection work has been done on detecting denial of service attacks <ref> [1] </ref>. 4 Our Model A network is modeled by a directed graph G = (V; E). Vertices represent routers and edges represent communication channels, which may be point-to-point links or networks attached to more than one router. Note that we do not model hosts that are not routers.

Reference-contexts: Preparata, Metze, and Chien (PMC) [19] proposed a framework for this kind of diagnosis. (Barborak, et al.'s paper <ref> [2] </ref> surveys work that [19] has initiated.) Preparata, et al. modeled a system equipped with automatic fault diagnosis in which system components can test each other to detect and to locate faulty components.

Reference-contexts: Temporary routing loops occur naturally, say when a link goes down, and solutions have been proposed to deal with them (e.g., <ref> [3] </ref>). Permanent routing loops or misrouting by a malicious router, depicted in Figure 1, are more serious problems. In an IP network, packets have a time-to-live (TTL) field, which guarantees a packet will not stay in the network forever. Hence routing loops and misrouting can cause packets to be dropped.

Reference-contexts: Thus when we remotely download router software to routers or configure routers, we need to use secure remote access protocols. Finn's report [5] is a good source of background information on the vulnerabilities of computer networks. Intrusion detection (e.g., <ref> [4, 6, 9, 15] </ref>) is a retrofit approach to improve the security of computer systems and networks. Intrusion detection systems detect and possibly respond to policy violations. A fundamental assumption of intrusion detection is that we have to live with existing systems and network infrastructures.

Reference-contexts: Because those control packets received a higher priority than the data packets, the routers in the ARPANET spent most of their time handling these routing updates. Thus the network was unavailable for hours. This particular problem was fixed, but other similar problems might still exist. Finn's comments <ref> [5] </ref> on the ARPANET incident are as follows: "It is clear that many such update sequences can be found. This occurred entirely by accident, from an unlikely set of circumstances. Network designers did not consider it a serious possibility. <p> However, a malicious router could easily create this situation and halt the network. Such an attack would be extremely damaging, difficult to prevent, and difficult to correct once it occurred." Routers exchange control packets to reflect changes, such as topology changes, in a network. A black hole router (e.g., <ref> [5] </ref>) sends out routing updates claiming that it is on zero-cost (or low-cost) paths to all destinations and then proceeds to drop the packets that it receives. <p> Thus the cryptographic authentication scheme does not offer adequate protection against some misbehaving routers. Perlman [17, 18] presents a scheme for public-key distribution and for protecting link state updates by means of digital signatures. Finn <ref> [5] </ref> discusses using public-key and secret-key routing update authentication in general and proposes a secure routing protocol. Kumar and Crowcroft [8] propose a design to secure IDPR, an inter-domain routing protocol. Murphy and Badger [16] propose a design to incorporate public-key distribution and signing link state updates in OSPF. <p> If a router is faulty or compromised, it may send out erroneous but authentic routing control packets. Thus when we remotely download router software to routers or configure routers, we need to use secure remote access protocols. Finn's report <ref> [5] </ref> is a good source of background information on the vulnerabilities of computer networks. Intrusion detection (e.g., [4, 6, 9, 15]) is a retrofit approach to improve the security of computer systems and networks. Intrusion detection systems detect and possibly respond to policy violations.

Reference-contexts: Bad routers may be caused by software/hardware faults, misconfiguration, or malicious attacks. We make the following assumption about good routers. its own routing table.

Assumption 4 (Existence and Connectivity of Good Routers) There exists at least one good router in the network. Good routers are connected via good routers.

Reference-contexts: For example, sending plain-text passwords in the clear is the only authentication method currently defined to protect routing update packets in RIP version 2 <ref> [10] </ref>. For OSPF version 2 [14], the OSPF standard defines a cryptographic authentication scheme in addition to a simple plain-text password scheme. However, in that cryptographic authentication scheme, routers on a network/subnet use a secret shared key to authenticate routing protocol packets.

Reference-contexts: In other words, neighboring routers can send packets directly to each other. Traditionally, security research works on the worst-case assumption that an adversary has unlimited power. Solutions developed under that assumption, if they exist at all, may be impractical to use <ref> [12] </ref>. In reality, some failures may be less likely to occur than others. For example, many router failures are caused by accidents. Another example is that an attacker may be able to change the routing table of a router but not the router software.

Reference-contexts: Although a bad router could delay forwarding those control packets, it only hurts that bad router itself for not having a consistent view among that router and its neighbors. Second, as noted in <ref> [13] </ref>, link costs are static, independent of link load, in modern link-state routing protocols. Thus normally link states do not change often. To cope with the few cases in which our assumption does not hold, again the threshold technique can be used.

Reference-contexts: We use a detection-response (i.e., an expansive view of intrusion detection) approach to protect networks from denial of service. In our approach, routers cooperatively diagnose each other to detect, locate, and respond to misbehaving routers. The idea of system diagnosis is not new; Preparata's, Metze's, and Chien's seminal paper <ref> [19] </ref> proposed a framework for automated system diagnosis. Our contribution is on designing tests specifically for router diagnosis and proving their detection and response properties. In simple terms, a testing router A sends a packet to a tested router B and verifies B's behavior against its expected behavior. <p> Preparata, Metze, and Chien (PMC) <ref> [19] </ref> proposed a framework for this kind of diagnosis. (Barborak, et al.'s paper [2] surveys work that [19] has initiated.)

Reference-contexts: They are the 1980 ARPANET collapse, "black hole" routers, and routers that misroute packets. In the 1980 ARPANET collapse <ref> [20] </ref>, the source of the problem was mainly due to a faulty router which generated a sequence of bad control packets. The sequence numbers of these control packets were ordered such that one was "fresher" than another and thus formed a cycle.
