Title: Relation algebra reducts of cylindric algebras and an application to proof theory  
Author: Robin Hirsch, Ian Hodkinson and Roger Maddux 
Date: December 7, 1998  
Abstract: We confirm a conjecture about neat embeddings of cylindric algebras made in 1969 by J. D. Monk, confirm a later conjecture by Maddux about relation algebras obtained from cylindric algebras, and solve a problem raised by Tarski and Givant. These results in algebraic logic have the following consequence for predicate logic: for every finite cardinal ff 3 there is a logically valid sentence ', in a first-order language with equality and exactly one nonlogical binary relation symbol, such that ' contains only 3 variables (each of which can occur arbitrarily many times), ' has a proof containing exactly ff+1 variables, but no proof containing only ff variables.

Reference-contexts: The conditions on ff and fi are sufficient for our purposes, but not entirely necessary. The definitions apply to any ff and fi, but we assume ff fi for simplicity and to avoid exploring fringe cases. The algebras constructed here were obtained from algebras in <ref> [10] </ref> by the addition of all the cycles of the form [e; q ; q ]. We could extend these results to cover the case fi = !, though the algebras are no longer finite in this case. <p> One of e, p 1 , or p 2 will work. Here we use 4 ff fi. 3.2 N fi ff is an ff-dimensional reduct We refer to <ref> [10] </ref> for the notions in this section. <p> In particular, B ff N fi dimensional basic matrices over N fi Lemma 6 For 4 ff fi &lt; !, B ff N fi ff is an ff-dimensional cylindrical basis for N fi Proof: By <ref> [10, theorem 7] </ref>, B ff A is an ff-dimensional cylindrical basis for A if we have 0 6= &lt;ff2 x ;y whenever x; y 2 ff2 fe; p 1 ; p 2 ; : : : ; p ff2 ; q 0 ; q 1 ; q 2 ; : : <p> Then [p fl ; x ; y ] is not a forbidden cycle, hence p fl Q Theorem 7 N fi Proof: B ff N ff is a cylindrical basis, so, by <ref> [10, theorem 10] </ref>, we may apply the complex algebra operator Ca and obtain a cylindric algebra C = CaB ff N fi ff with C 2 CA ff and N ff = RaC. ff is one-generated Theorem 8 N fi ff is generated by e without using 1 , Proof: 6 <p> Theorem 14 If 4 ff &lt; ! then fij ff ; " 3 6= fij ff+1 ; " 3 fij + 3 6= fij + 3 : Proof: The proof is based on the proof of <ref> [10, Theorem 25] </ref>. Suppose fi &gt; ff. Later we will choose fi 2 (f (ff 1) + 1). We use the algebra N fi ff to form an algebraic realization of L + ff . <p> The set B ff N ff is an ff-dimensional cylindrical basis for N fi and it is easy to see that B ff N fi ff is also "permutation closed" (meaning that B ff N fi satisfies condition (C 3 ) in <ref> [10, Definition 16] </ref>), so M = hN fi fi dimensional algebraic realization [10, Definition 16]. <p> N ff is an ff-dimensional cylindrical basis for N fi and it is easy to see that B ff N fi ff is also "permutation closed" (meaning that B ff N fi satisfies condition (C 3 ) in <ref> [10, Definition 16] </ref>), so M = hN fi fi dimensional algebraic realization [10, Definition 16]. The set of predicates forms an algebra under the predicate operations, namely P = ; +; ; fi;; 1 : The algebra P is an absolutely free algebra of similarity type h2; 1; 2; 1; 0i, freely generated by E (see [16, p. 238]). <p> it is easy to prove that h (P ) = v 0 P v 1 =' + ff+1 for every P 2 . (Alternatively, one can define the mapping h by this formula, and then use (DI)- (DV) to prove that h is a homomorphism.) The denotation function D M <ref> [10, Definition 17] </ref> maps predicates in to elements of N fi ff and formulas in + ff to subsets of B ff N fi ff . <p> Restricted to , D M is a homomorphism from P onto N fi Since P is absolutely freely generated by E, this homomorphism is completely determined by the condition that D M (E) = e. It follows from <ref> [10, Theorem 22 (iii)] </ref> that D M (X) = B ff N fi ff for every X 2 fij + ff ;: (7) g h fi A P H H H H H Hj j Next we will derive a contradiction by assuming that D M (P ) = D M <p> On the other hand, D M (P ) 6= D M (Q) implies D M (P = Q) 6= B ff N fi by <ref> [10, lemma 21 (x)] </ref>, hence by (7), P = Q =2 fij + ff ;. Note that P = Q is in + 3 since it is a sentence with no variables at all. Thus the second inequality holds.

In <ref> [16] </ref> it is shown that L + is actually equipollent with L in means of both expression and proof; there is a recursive function G that eliminates occurences of the predicate operators in accordance with (DI)- (DV), preserving provability and meaning; see Chapter 2 for details. <p> For 3 ff &lt; !, the formalisms L ff and L + ff are obtained from L and L + by restricting the set of variables to ff = fv 0 ; : : : ; v ff1 g (see <ref> [16, p. 91] </ref>.)

Treating the connectives and quantifiers as operations on formulas, we construct another absolutely free algebra, this time having the same similarity type as (ff + 1)-dimensional cylindric algebras, namely, C = + ffi E : Define a binary relation ' + ff+1 on + ff+1 as follows. <p> Note that P = Q is in + 3 since it is a sentence with no variables at all.
