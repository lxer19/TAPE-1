Abstract: This paper describes the work achieved in the first half of a 4-year cooperative research project (ARCADE), financed by AUPELF-UREF. The project is devoted to the evaluation of parallel text alignment techniques. In its first period ARCADE ran a competition between six systems on a sentence-to-sentence alignment task which yielded two main types of results. First, a large reference bilingual corpus comprising of texts of different genres was created, each presenting various degrees of difficulty with respect to the alignment task.

Reference-contexts: More sophisticated applications based on alignment technology have also been the object of recent work, such as the automatic building of bilingual lexical resources (Melamed, 1996; Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1995), the automatic verification of translations (Macklovitch, 1995), the automatic dictation of translations <ref> (Brousseau et al., 1995) </ref> and even interactive machine translation (Foster et al., 1997). Enthusiasm for this relatively new field was sparked early on by the apparent demonstration that very simple techniques could yield almost perfect results.

Reference-contexts: A dynamic programming scheme is applied to all alignment levels in successive steps. IRMC This system involves a preliminary, rough word alignment step which uses a transfer dictionary and a measure of the proximity of words <ref> (Debili et al., 1994) </ref>. Sentence alignment is then achieved by an algorithm which optimizes several criteria such as word-order conservation and synchronization between the two texts. LIA Like Jacal, the LIA system uses a pre-processing step involving cognate recognition which restricts the search space, but in a less restrictive way.

Reference-contexts: The underlying principle is the automatic detection of isolated cognates (i.e. for which no other similar word exists in a window of given size). Once the search space is reduced, the system aligns the sentences using the well-known sentence-length model described in <ref> (Gale and Church, 1991) </ref>. RALI/Salign The second method proposed by RALI is based on a dynamic programming scheme which uses a score function derived from a translation model similar to that of (Brown et al., 1990).
