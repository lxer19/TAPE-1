Title: Infinitary Domain Logic for Finitary Transition Systems  
Author: Marcello M. Bonsangue and Joost N. Kok

Abstract: The Lindenbaum algebra generated by the Abramsky fini-tary logic is a distributive lattice dual to an SFP-domain obtained as a solution of a recursive domain equation. We extend Abramsky's result by proving that the Lindenbaum algebra generated by the infinitary logic is a completely distributive lattice dual to the same SFP-domain. As a consequence soundness and completeness of the infinitary logic is obtained for the class of finitary transition systems. A corollary of this result is that the same holds for the infinitary Hennessy-Milner logic.

Reference-contexts: It is surely worthwhile to work out these infinitary extensions in detail, but we leave it as future work. The present paper does not deal with a formal comparison between Abram-sky's logic and Hennessy-Milner logic for transition systems. Such a comparison can be found in <ref> [Abr91b] </ref>, where L 1;1 is proved equivalent to the infinitary Hennessy-Milner logic in the sense that a process of a transition system satisfies a formula of Abramsky's logic if and only if it satisfies the equivalent formula in the Hennessy-Milner logic.

Reference-contexts: by means of general and reusable mathematical notions of topology and domain theory (examples in this direction include a domain logic for Gamma [GH94] which was originally formulated as a transition assertion logic [EHJ93], and a domain logic for a shared-variable parallel language [Zha91] which was originally formulated by Brookes <ref> [Bro85] </ref>). This is part of Abramsky's general programme of connecting domain theory and operational notions of observability with denotational semantics and program logics. In this paper we have not fully provided the infinitary domain logics for the specific languages of Abramsky for properties, typed terms, and morphisms.
