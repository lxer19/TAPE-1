Abstract: We describe a prototype implementation of an analysis system for medical imaging. Our system is based on a Scheme interpreter kernel steering and interconnecting the other modules. The kernel sees the functionalities of the modules as Scheme's primitives, even if the modules are running on different machines.

Reference-contexts: All the other modules are seen by the kernel as Scheme <ref> [AS85] </ref> primitives. The following are the advantages of this mechanism. Easy system expansion When a module is added the kernel gets its definition, as a list of input and output variables. Modules can either be running as a different process or be directly linked to the kernel program.

Reference-contexts: Direct volume rendering techniques are instead well suited to visualize anatomical structures which voxels' values cover a wide range as, for instance, brain tissues <ref> [Lev88, DCH88] </ref>. We implemented a volume rendering method, based on the ray-tracing technique, as a module for our system. In Fig.9 the same dataset of Fig.8 is rendered using this module to generate a similar picture.

Reference-contexts: The hub of the system is the kernel connected with the computational modules <ref> [HE92] </ref>. The modules can reside on the same machine of the kernel and communicate with it sharing data in memory or on a different machine and communicate via a socket connection. 2.1 The kernel The central part of the system is the kernel module based on Elk a .

Reference-contexts: There are several languages that are explicitly designed to perform manipulation over arrays. The oldest of them is APL (Array Processing Language) dated back to the sixties. More recently came the new version of APL, APL2 and a language directly related to APL named J <ref> [Hui] </ref>. Although these languages are very powerful and flexible they are, in a way, too sophisticated for our needs. They tend, for instance, to replicate many times the data structures they work with.

Reference-contexts: The most popular method to reconstruct 3D iso-surfaces, the "marching cubes" algorithm, has been developed in an MRI environment <ref> [LC87, WG90] </ref>. We implemented our version of this algorithm in a module. The environment can be programmed in Scheme, so that the user can pick a range of values from the Synthetic X-rays module and, by a mouse click, launch the iso-surface extractor.
