Abstract: We propose a new approach, which we call independence diagrams. We divide each attribute into ranges; for each pair of attributes, the combination of these ranges defines a two-dimensional grid. For each cell of this grid, we store the number of data items in it. We display the grid, scaling each attribute axis so that the displayed width of a range is proportional to the total number of data items within that range. The brightness of a cell is proportional to the density of data items in it. As a result, both attributes are independently normalized by frequency, ensuring insensitivity to outliers and skew, and allowing specific focus on attribute dependencies. Furthermore, independence diagrams provide quantitative measures of the interaction between two attributes, and allow formal reasoning about issues such as statistical significance.

Reference-contexts: Little of this information could be conveyed by a scatterplot or equi-width histogram under presence of outliers and skew. Related Work A variety of data visualization techniques such as scatterplots <ref> (Andrews 1972) </ref>, hyperslice (van Wijk & van Liere 1993), parallel coordinates (Inselberg 1985) and circle segments (Ankerst, Keim, & Kriegel 1996) have been proposed. No previous technique specifically addressed visualizing attribute dependence effects while normalizing out the one-dimensional distributions. See (Keim 1997) for a survey.

Reference-contexts: The width of the region gives us x = P r (R A ). Thus, one can also generate the counts for each range and the intersection region, which allows one to estimate the statistical significance of the difference between x and y. (See <ref> (DuMouchel et al. 1996) </ref> for an example of a technique for evaluating statistical significance in a two-dimensional matrix.) In a first example, we show what an uninteresting independence diagram looks like. Recall that uninteresting in our sense means "contains no attribute dependencies".

Reference-contexts: The 5% and 95% quantile values gave good results on most (but not all) of our data sets. A more sophisticated approach might be to use a grey-scale mapping table as proposed in <ref> (Levkowitz 1997) </ref>. Such tables have been constructed so that visual gradations in brightness correspond subjectively to humans as linear gradations in some scale. We tried such mappings, but found that they did not give sufficiently good grey-scale distinction between buckets.
