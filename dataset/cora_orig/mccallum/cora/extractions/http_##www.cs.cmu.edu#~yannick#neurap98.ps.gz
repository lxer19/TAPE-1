Abstract: One of the most interesting properties of neuro-symbolic hybrid models is that they allow for the combination of knowledge-based and data-based approaches. We have used such a strategy in a large, complex steel-making problem. We present this problem together with one of the hybrid models that have been tested on it. We choose to describe this hybrid in details because it is representative of such data-knowledge integration.

Reference-contexts: The rules can be defined by an expert, or learned from a data set, which is the ap 2 proach adopted here. The rules were generated by Iglesias et al. <ref> [2] </ref> using the C4.5 decision tree algorithm [7] and the training set described below. This data-based fuzzy-logic module is used to tune a knowledge-based model. Once trained, the fuzzy logic engine is fed with the 12 parameters constituting a point, and returns an ff value.

Reference-contexts: To solve atypical points, the physical model is used. In order to maximize the accuracy of the physical model, we use a fuzzy logic engine to compute the error-correcting ff coefficients. This component is based on the FuzzyCLIPS <ref> [3] </ref> engine. FuzzyCLIPS is an extended version of the CLIPS expert system shell developed by the NASA that allows fuzzy and normal terms to be freely mixed in the rules and facts of an expert system.

Reference-contexts: As a consequence, the steelmakers found that 3,500 tons of steel that used to be returned each year by customers will not be returned any longer because of the higher quality of the steel. A new version of that system, using a Ko-honen network <ref> [4] </ref> to select the model to use instead of a look-up table leads to a 10:5% error rate [1]. An online implementation of this new version is currently under study.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, dividing the space optimally is a complex problem. 3.2 A multi-layer perceptron Presetting the rolling force can also be done by a multilayer perceptron (MLP). A 12x12x6x1 MLP was designed and trained on this task <ref> [5] </ref>. The inputs of the MLP are the normalized values (in the [0..1] interval) of the parameters listed in table 1. <p> The learning algorithm is back-propagation. The MLP has been trained for 1000 epochs using the training set described below. Unlike the physical model, this model does not use any knowledge but only data to achieve its performance. Previous tests <ref> [5] </ref> showed that the MLP model was accurate for most data points, but performed poorly on certain specific points. We call a point typical if the MLP gives an accurate reply. If not, the point is called atypical. <p> The atypical points are situated in the atypical domains listed in table 2 <ref> [5] </ref> and correspond to uncommon customer orders. The atypical domains have been empirically determined by examining the error distribution of the MLP. 4 Architecture of the hybrid system In order to maximize the performance of the MLP, our hybrid system uses the MLP only to solve typical points.

Reference-contexts: Then we fully describe one specific hybrid model, in order to underline the performance gain due to the hybridization and give an example of successful integration of data-based and knowledge-based approaches. 2 The application The application we are interested in <ref> [6] </ref> consists of presetting the rolling force that is applied to a sheet of steel in a steel rollmill (Figure 1). The value of that force will determine the characteristics of the sheet when it leaves the rollmill.

Reference-contexts: different existing models of the application at our disposal: one using a knowledge-based approach (the physical model) and one using a data-based approach (a multi-layer perceptron). 3.1 The physical model Presetting the rolling force can be done by a model describing the physical processes that take place in the rollmill <ref> [8] </ref>. This model is a set of equations based on several areas of physics (especially mechanics and thermodynamics). Using 8 of our 12 parameters, the model leads to a value for the rolling force. <p> Using 8 of our 12 parameters, the model leads to a value for the rolling force. This value is obtained by following a set of well defined and meaningful steps, as described in <ref> [8] </ref>; this is clearly a knowledge-based approach to solve the problem. Unfortunately this model is not very accurate (with an average error rate as defined in section 6.2 of 25%) and its accuracy depends on the region of 12-dimensional space on which it is applied.
