Title: Group Blind Digital Signatures: A Scalable Solution to Electronic Cash

Abstract: In this paper we construct a practical group blind signature scheme. Our scheme combines the already existing notions of blind signatures and group signatures. It is an extension of Camenisch and Stadler's Group Signature Scheme [5] that adds the blindness property. We show how to use our group blind signatures to construct an electronic cash system in which multiple banks can securely distribute anonymous and untraceable e-cash. Moreover, the identity of the e-cash issuing bank is concealed, which is conceptually novel. The space, time, and communication complexities of the relevant parameters and operations are independent of the group size.

Reference-contexts: The spender retains anonymity in any transaction that involves electronic coins since they are blindly signed. Blind Signatures have been looked at extensively in the literature [6, 16, 14].

Reference-contexts: Recently, Camenisch and Stadler [5] presented the first group signature scheme for which the size of the group public key remains independent of the group size, as do the time, space, and, communication complexities of the necessary operations; in previous schemes <ref> [9, 3, 10] </ref> the size of the public key grew with the size of the group which is impractical for large groups. We extend [5] by showing how to add the blindness property to their scheme. <p> Our scheme consists of several signers (members of the group), their group manager, and several users. We combine two concepts: blind signatures [6, 16, 14] and group signatures <ref> [5, 9, 3, 10] </ref>. Our model allows the members of a group to sign messages on behalf of the group such that the following properties hold for the resulting signature: 1.

To construct blind signatures of knowledge, we modify some of the signatures of knowledge constructs proposed by [5]. The proofs of security that work for [5] also work for our signatures of knowledge. The first signature of knowledge we consider, both in the regular and blind settings, is the signature of knowledge of the discrete logarithm of a given y 2 G to a given base g (hgi = G). Definition 1. <p> We now define signatures of knowledge based on variations of the discrete logarithm problem and extend the protocol above to construct blind versions of these signatures. One important variation is the representation problem, studied in <ref> [2, 5] </ref>. It is a direct generalization of the signature of knowledge discussed above, except we have y 1 ; :::; y w instead of just one y, and g 1 ; :::; g v , instead of just one g. <p> We omit a more formal treatment of signatures of knowledge based on the representation problem due to space limitations. We also employ signatures of knowledge of the double discrete logarithm and of the roots of discrete logarithms introduced in <ref> [5] </ref> and show how to make them blind signatures. Definition 2. <p> We omit this here due to lack of space. 4 Our Group Blind Signature Scheme Camenisch and Stadler <ref> [5] </ref> have two schemes for group signatures: their basic scheme and their efficient scheme. Their efficient scheme is less secure and there fore in this extended abstract we concentrate on extending their basic scheme to allow for blind signatures. <p> Their efficient scheme is less secure and there fore in this extended abstract we concentrate on extending their basic scheme to allow for blind signatures. However, our techniques apply to both. 4.1 Setup To set up the group signature scheme, as in <ref> [5] </ref>, the group manager chooses a security parameter l and computes the following values: 1. An RSA Public Key (n,e), where the length of n is at least 2l bits. 2. A cyclic group G = hgi of order n for which computing discrete logarithms is hard. <p> An upper bound on the length of the secret keys and a constant &gt; 1. The group's public key is Y = (n; e; G; g; a; ; ). 4.2 Join As in <ref> [5] </ref>, if Alice wants to join the group she picks a secret key x 2 R f0; 1; : : :; 2 1g and calculates y = a x (mod n) and the membership key z = g y . <p> If the group manager is convinced that Alice knows x he gives her a membership certificate v (y + 1) 1=e (mod n). It is an additional security assumption due to <ref> [5] </ref> that computing v without factoring n is hard. 4.3 Sign and Verify Unlike [5], our signature construction protocol is blind. When responding to a sign request, the signer does the following: 1. Obtain q 2 R ZZ fl n and set ~z := ~g y (8) 2. <p> If the group manager is convinced that Alice knows x he gives her a membership certificate v (y + 1) 1=e (mod n). It is an additional security assumption due to <ref> [5] </ref> that computing v without factoring n is hard. 4.3 Sign and Verify Unlike [5], our signature construction protocol is blind. When responding to a sign request, the signer does the following: 1. Obtain q 2 R ZZ fl n and set ~z := ~g y (8) 2. <p> All signatures take constant space, and communication complexity per signature is constant. Computational, space, and communication complexities are linear in the security parameter l. 4.6 Security of the Proposed Scheme Our scheme is exactly as secure as Camenisch and Stadler's Basic Group Signature Scheme <ref> [5] </ref>. The security of the scheme is based on the assumptions that the discrete logarithm, double discrete logarithm, and the roots of discrete logarithm problems are hard. In addition, it is based on the security of the Schnorr and the RSA signature schemes and on the additional assumption due to [5] <p> <ref> [5] </ref>. The security of the scheme is based on the assumptions that the discrete logarithm, double discrete logarithm, and the roots of discrete logarithm problems are hard. In addition, it is based on the security of the Schnorr and the RSA signature schemes and on the additional assumption due to [5] that computing membership certificates is hard. 4.7 Improvements on the Efficiency Camenisch and Stadler [5] also proposed a group signature scheme in which the computational complexity of the Open algorithm is constant in the size of the group. <p> In addition, it is based on the security of the Schnorr and the RSA signature schemes and on the additional assumption due to <ref> [5] </ref> that computing membership certificates is hard. 4.7 Improvements on the Efficiency Camenisch and Stadler [5] also proposed a group signature scheme in which the computational complexity of the Open algorithm is constant in the size of the group. This scheme can also be extended to a group blind signature scheme. <p> Our result is an extension of the group signature scheme recently prosposed by Camenisch and Stadler in <ref> [5] </ref>. We showed how our construction could be used to set up an electronic cash system in which more than one bank can dispense anonymous e-cash.

Reference-contexts: Our scheme is unique since it considers scalability as a criterion in the design of electronic cash systems. Moreover, our scheme is conceptually novel since we conceal the bank's identity in addition to the spender's. 1.2 Blind Digital Signatures Blind Digital Signatures were introduced by Chaum <ref> [7] </ref> to allow for spender anonymity in Electronic Cash systems. Such signatures require that a signer be able to sign a document without knowing its contents. <p> We now show how to use group blind digital signatures to achieve a scheme in which multiple banks can securely distribute anonymous and untraceable electronic cash. First we give the main ideas, and then we address some of the relevant problems. The basic techniques are due to Chaum <ref> [7] </ref>. All the banks form a group and their manager will be the country's Central Bank (e.g. U.S. Treasury or the Federal Reserve). If Alice wants to withdraw e-cash from her bank, she first creates an electronic coin C.
