Abstract: More and more databases are being used in situations where real-time constraints exist. A set of misconceptions have arisen regarding what a real-time database is and the appropriateness of using conventional databases in real-time applications. Nine misconceptions are identified and discussed. Various research challenges are enumerated and explained. In total, the paper articulates the special nature of real-time databases.

Reference-contexts: There now exists ample evidence that such protocols are considerably better at supporting real-time transaction and data correctness than standard database protocols which simply go fast <ref> [1, 6, 7, 10, 12] </ref>. Real-time computing is equivalent to fast computing. 4 The objective of fast computing is to minimize the average response time of a set of transactions.

Reference-contexts: higher level (non-real-time) data was required it was probably placed in a totally separate database system, outside the real-time data purview. 2 Definition A real-time database system is a database system where timing constraints are associated with transactions and data have specific time intervals for which the data are valid <ref> [9, 2] </ref>. The transaction timing constraints can be deadlines to complete by, times by which they must start, periodic invocations, etc. It is not necessary that every transaction has a timing constraint, only that some transactions do. See Figure 1 for an example of a real-time database application.

Reference-contexts: However, different real-time operating system don't have to be developed for each application. 4 Research Challenges While a significant amount of real-time database research has been done <ref> [3] </ref>, this field is still in its early stages. Several key research challenges are now itemized and discussed. 4.1 System Support In comparison to traditional tasks (processes), database transactions differ in several ways. One area is the differences with respect to obtaining worst case execution times.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that disk scheduling algorithms that combine a scan and deadline requirement works considerably better than conventional algorithms <ref> [4] </ref>. It is likely that some combined solution will prevail where critical data is placed and pinned in (non-volatile) main memory, and other, less critical data is stored on the disk using time cognizant 6 disk scheduling. A temporal database is a real-time database.

Reference-contexts: Time has several dimensions, but in the context of databases, two dimensions are of particular interest: valid time which denotes the time a fact was true in reality, and transaction time during which the fact was present in the database as stored data <ref> [8] </ref>. These two dimensions are in general orthogonal, although there could be some application-dependent correlations of the two times.
