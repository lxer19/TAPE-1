Title: Experimental Study of Issues in End-to-End QoS  
Author: Klara Nahrstedt and Jonathan Smith

Affiliation: Distributed System Laboratory Computer Science Department University of  
Abstract: Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for 'delay sensitive' networked applications must be end-to-end. This paper presents an experimental study of this class of applications where the endpoints are computer workstations. The experiments show that operating system effects dominate any jitter in the network. Our conclusion is that QoS provision by the workstation operating system is as important for maintaining end-to-end guarantees as is network QoS. In local-area settings, operating system influences may be more challenging for end-to-end QoS than network influences. The important influence variables are the degree of multiprocessing, the employed transport protocol (e.g. UDP or TCP), and the priorities assigned to processes.

Reference-contexts: Recent foci have included real-time thread models (e.g. Real-Time Mach) and scheduling mechanisms of the processor (e.g. Integrated Time-Driven Scheduler) <ref> [1] </ref>, fine granularity of timers and clock interfaces (e.g. POSIX 1003.4, AIX 3.1, SVR4 UNIX). Further, there are operating systems like FORMULA, which provide user primitives for coordinating timing requests from the applications [19]. Scheduling primitives were implemented in FORMULA for the Computer Music Performance.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One of the important forms of information networks carry is "delay sensitive multimedia" traffic. The information is carried between end-points using delay-bounded communication protocols. Such protocols and their architecture have been of great interest in the computer networking community [3], <ref> [2] </ref>, [6]. The other element in delay-sensitive networking is the behavior of the endpoints. This is the focus of our paper. The endpoints of future networks, except for the most trivial, will contain a processor, and should be flexible enough to offer some customization.

The measured delay is equal to the the processing time of XPutImage <ref> [16] </ref> in case of IPC and TCP/IP communication between application client and X server, and in case of UDP/IP we measure the time between sending the first byte of the video frame at the sender side and display of the full video frame with XPutImage through IPC at the receiver side.
