Abstract: Some speech analysis techniques used in automatic speech recognition utilize temporal processing of short-term speech feature vectors to derive a final feature set. We argue that such a strategy in in priciple consistent with properties of human hearing and could lead to improved performance of the recognizer in adverse environments.

Reference-contexts: In its original formulation of the technique an averaged spectrum of a new signal is matched to an averaged spectrum of some reference. The current reincarnation of this technique, known under the name of cep-stral mean subtraction (see e.g. <ref> [2] </ref>) simply removes means of all time trajectories of cep-stral coefficients, thus setting the log spectrum mean to zero. The cepstral mean subtraction is currently quickly becoming a main stream supplementary technique in speech analysis in ASR whenever a real-time operation is not required.

Reference-contexts: The time-spectral pattern seems to be used exclusively in conjunction with nonlinear classifiers.

Reference-contexts: The integration time constant of the filter is about 160 ms. The filter pass-band appears to have some relation to properties of human hearing in perception of FM signals <ref> [14] </ref>. The steep filter slopes, however, do not seem to be consistent with human auditory perception [15]. Hermansky et al. [19] also investigate use of FIR RASTA filtering of the cubic-root compressed power spectrum trajectories for enhancement of noisy speech.

Reference-contexts: The recent work <ref> [15] </ref> indicates that RASTA processing may be simulating forward temporal masking in human hearing. Ideally, after the appropriate transformation of the features prior to RASTA filtering, the disturbing components should combine linearly with the components which we need to preserve, so that the two can be separated by linear filtering. <p> The integration time constant of the filter is about 160 ms.

Reference-contexts: on the original short-term features, they do contribute new information which was previously unavailable to the pattern classification component of an ASR system: the information about surroundings of the current short-term segment. 4.4 Dynamic Cepstrum (time frequency masking filters) Just as the dynamic feature calculation, a so called dynamic cepstrum <ref> [16] </ref> explicitly imposes weighting of cepstral coefficients within the relatively short (about 50 ms) temporal window. The weighting represents a Gaussian approximation of the data on simultaneous time-frequency masking. It implies longer time constants of the forward temporal masking on lower quefrency cepstral coefficients.

Reference-contexts: Different cepstral coefficients are processed by different FIR filters. All the filters are high-pass filters with a cutoff frequency around 10-15 Hz. The filters for lower cepstral coefficients have steeper slopes than filters for higher cepstral coefficients. Bacchiani and Aikawa <ref> [17] </ref> attempt to optimize the time-frequency masking filters weights in a multilayer perceptron recognizer yields only small changes in the weights and also only a marginal improvement in the accuracy of recognition. 4.5 RASTA processing Similarly to the dynamic feature calculation, the so called RASTA processing [18] does filtering of time

Reference-contexts: To minimize the inherent processing delay of this technique, the mean is typically computed over some finite amount of future data. (Past data are also used in some implementations). Mean removal over different length data implies different FIR filtering of cepstral coefficient time trajectories <ref> [18] </ref>. 4.2 Multi-vector input Some ten years ago Makino et al. [?] proposed a so called time-spectrum pattern as a method to classify a short-term speech segment using additional information available in a longer time interval of speech surrounding a given speech instant. <p> The dynamic feature calculation represents finite impulse response (FIR) filtering of time trajectories of cepstral coefficients. The implied band-pass filters are rather selective, emphasizing speech components with a higher (about 8-12 Hz) rate of change <ref> [18] </ref>. As men tioned above, the dynamic features are invariant to fixed distortions in parameters. <p> Bacchiani and Aikawa [17] attempt to optimize the time-frequency masking filters weights in a multilayer perceptron recognizer yields only small changes in the weights and also only a marginal improvement in the accuracy of recognition. 4.5 RASTA processing Similarly to the dynamic feature calculation, the so called RASTA processing <ref> [18] </ref> does filtering of time trajectories of speech features.

Reference-contexts: Also, speech transitions are typically enhanced. This presents no problem in whole-word ASR but needs to be considered in current sub-word (phoneme) based ASR systems. 4.6 Probabilistic optimum filtering The most recent application of temporal filtering in the feature space is the so called probabilistic optimum filtering <ref> [20] </ref>. In this technique, relatively short (typically about 70 ms) two-dimensional piecewise-linear FIR filters are used on a time-quefrency pattern of cepstral coefficients. The filters are derived by optimizing the mapping between a vector-quantized vector space of clean speech cep-stral coefficients and a vector space of noisy coefficients.
