Abstract: In this paper we report on an ongoing project to design and build the network and transport layers for mobile networking. The network architecture used is unique in that it separates the mobile network(s) from fixed networks and provides connectivity between the two via special gateways. These gateways provide QOS guarantees to mobile users for all their open connections. We provide summaries of all the protocols we are implementing (or have implemented) and discuss possible improvements.

Reference-contexts: This results in the TCP sender timing out and retransmitting the unacknowledged packets thus greatly reducing the efficiency of the connection. A solution to this problem is the I-TCP protocol (Indirect-TCP), implemented at Rutgers University as part of the DataMan project (see Barke <ref> [1] </ref>), that provides efficient reliable communication for the wireless environment. A benefit of the above implementation is that it allows mobile hosts to be connected over the Internet. <p> Specifically, if the receiver is a MH, the TCP sender times out frequently because of the `blackout' periods in mobile networks. The solution of Barke <ref> [1] </ref> breaks the connection in two (similar to our idea with the difference that they consider mobile networks to be part of the internet) from the fixed host to the MSS and from the MSS to the MH. <p> Since M-TCP is layered on top of a reliable virtual circuit connection (reliable within one mobile sub-network), its design is relatively simplified. Even though this design looks similar to I-TCP, unlike Brake <ref> [1] </ref>, we implement almost TCP-like semantics that make it easier for the sending application to recover from the type of error described above. The TCP client on the SH always ACKs all but the last byte of data received from the sender.

Reference-contexts: Only a small percentage of loss is due to lack of bandwidth. A high-level view of our M-UDP protocol as implemented is the following (a detailed protocol may be found in Brown <ref> [2] </ref>). * Every UDP packet is buffered at the SH. * The SH discards a packet if it has run out of buffer space or if it has been transmitted n times to the MSS.

Here, a geographical region such as a campus is divided into microcells with a diameter of the order of hundreds of meters.

Reference-contexts: These messages are then retransmitted to the new location of the MH. A detailed protocol is presented in Gahi <ref> [6] </ref> (though our current implementation contains many changes). For routing over the fixed network (e.g., between SHs or between an SH and a service provider), the existing routing protocol provided over the fixed network is used. <p> The information exchanged during this handshake includes the identity of the previous SH and information about all open connections, see Ghai <ref> [6] </ref>). Meanwhile all datagrams arriving at the old SH are sent on to the new SH via IP loose source routing. In our implementation, we require the MH to maintain the identity of the original SH (who first set up the TCP connection).

Reference-contexts: Some of the problems mentioned above have been addressed by other researchers as we discuss below. Routing in Mobile Networks: In mobile networks, since the hosts are mobile, routing is a problem. Ioanidis <ref> [9] </ref> proposes a solution called the IPIP ("IP-within-IP") protocol. Here every MH has a unique IP address called its `home address'. To deliver a packet to a remote MH, the source MSS first broadcasts an ARP to all other MSS nodes to locate the MH. Eventually some MSS responds.

Reference-contexts: In our implementation all MH nodes have unique IP addresses (with some `home' network as part of the address). Here the SH nodes route messages to the MH by using the IP loose source routing option (following the work of Johnson <ref> [10] </ref>). The destination address in the header is set to the IP address of the MSS and the MH IP address is contained as the first IP address in the option part of the header.

Reference-contexts: The prefix M stands for `mobile'. Thus we have a version of mobile-TCP and mobile-UDP. M-CM refers to the mobile-continuous media protocol and is useful for implementing real-time services such as voice or video. It is loosely based on the continuous media protocol of Moran <ref> [12] </ref>. The mobility management module deals with the problems of mobility (i.e., re-establishing transport connections when a MH moves between sub-networks and renegotiating QOS parameters). 10 3.2.1 M-TCP In section 1.1 we touched upon the problems associated with providing TCP-like service over mobile networks. <p> This kind of data is referred to as continuous media and some examples include voice communication, video communication, etc. Continuous media applications have severe time deadlines and bandwidth requirements and thus cannot be implemented on top of message-based transport protocols such as M-TCP or M-UDP. Following Moran <ref> [12] </ref> we propose a separate transport protocol suite called M-CM (mobile-continuous media) that will provide the functionality required by such applications. Unfortunately, however, the protocols proposed in Moran [12] and other solutions 12 proposed for the high-speed network domain cannot be adapted to the mobile networks because of two reasons: * <p> Following Moran <ref> [12] </ref> we propose a separate transport protocol suite called M-CM (mobile-continuous media) that will provide the functionality required by such applications.

Reference-contexts: A detailed protocol is presented in Seal <ref> [13] </ref>. See Figure 6 for an explanation of the operation of this layer. Here the data stream at the sender is broken into data segments (logical segments) separated by special flags. These flags are inserted by the LPTSL layer at the sender.

Reference-contexts: This is clearly an undesirable situation. * Cell latency times (staying time in a cell) are typically small (several seconds). This exac erbates both of the above problems. Our architecture is discussed in detail in Singh <ref> [14] </ref>. We summarize the main points in this section. Our architecture may be viewed as a three-level hierarchy (see Figure 1). At the lowest level are the mobile hosts (MH) who communicate with MSS nodes in each cell. <p> This is because the intermediate routers in the fixed network will automatically associate the IP address of SH 2 with the VIP address of the MH (see Singh <ref> [14] </ref> for more details) and route datagrams accordingly. 3.2.2 M-UDP If we were to implement UDP in the mobile network without any changes, the performance seen by a MH would be very poor.

Reference-contexts: Upon receiving this packet the destination MSS extracts the original packet and attempts to deliver it to the destination MH. If the MH has moved away, the destination MSS attempts to locate it by broadcasting an ARP request. As discussed in Teraoka <ref> [15] </ref> this method is not easily scalable. Teraoka [15] proposes a more flexible solution to the problem called the Virtual Internet Protocol or VIP. Here every host has a virtual network address (VIP address) that is unchanging. <p> If the MH has moved away, the destination MSS attempts to locate it by broadcasting an ARP request.
