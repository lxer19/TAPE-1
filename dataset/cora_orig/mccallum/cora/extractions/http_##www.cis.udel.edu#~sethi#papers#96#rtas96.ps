Abstract: A group of individual real-time systems that must coordinate high level actions among themselves can itself be viewed as a real-time system. Often, the communications must be wireless, which being inherently noisy, constrains these high level messages to being soft, i.e., some deadlines can be missed without detrimentally effecting overall functioning. Current military systems and future interconnection of embedded real-time systems will require wireless communications. We present and compare analyses of three protocols; variations of two published protocols by Paterakis and Gallager as well as our new one, the Sliding Partition (SP) collision resolution algorithm (CRA). The modified Gallager CRA cannot be practically implemented in wireless networks but is used for comparison because it is perhaps the most famous window splitting CRA. In a real-time setting, however, it consistently performs worst of the three we consider. We observe that the time bounded Paterakis CRA offers extremely easy implementation, and performs better than the modified Gallager CRA but worse than our new CRA. Our proposed SP algorithm offers both easy implementation and better performance. We also observe that our SP algorithm is fairer to low laxity packets than the Paterakis CRA. We present an analytic model for each when packets are assigned varying initial laxities. Both analytic and simulation results are obtained to study the maximum input traffic rates that can be sustained for various laxities, CRA delay bounds, and message loss rates.

Reference-contexts: Subsequently, Zhao et al. [ZSR90] proposed a window splitting protocol which always performed in simulation at least as well as the virtual time protocols and often better. Less complex window splitting algorithms are presented for both hard and soft real-time systems by Arvind <ref> [Arv91] </ref> where protocol operations are simulated and some worst case performance analysis is also presented. Georgiadis et al. [GMPK87] develop a straightforward, general method of delay analysis using regenerative properties of random multiple access algorithms. <p> We do the same for the other two protocols. The next considered is a variation of the famous FCFS Gallager algorithm [Gal78], [BG92] modified by us with binary feedback, strict delay bounds, and laxity ranking. This is similar to one studied by Arvind <ref> [Arv91] </ref> but his does not incorporate a delay bound. Finally, we present a new protocol, the Sliding Partition (SP) CRA, that takes deadlines into account yet remains algorithmically simple. 2 Algorithm In these protocols, a packet has a single property of interest, its laxity.

Reference-contexts: This is unrealistic for general real-time systems, so we make the change of assigning a deadline from a distribution. We do the same for the other two protocols. The next considered is a variation of the famous FCFS Gallager algorithm [Gal78], <ref> [BG92] </ref> modified by us with binary feedback, strict delay bounds, and laxity ranking. This is similar to one studied by Arvind [Arv91] but his does not incorporate a delay bound. <p> Paterakis simply uses this technique at the outset. 2 If another collision occurs, the window is split in half, and the CRA recurses first on the left half and then on the right. The CRA behaves similarly to the classical FCFS splitting algorithm <ref> [BG92] </ref> with a few differences: packets in a window following a collision are ordered by laxity rather than by queue arrival time, and feedback is binary rather than ternary. We further impose a bound T which is the maximum number of slots a CRI may comprise.

Reference-contexts: Approaches to limiting or removing these shortcomings for time constrained communication on random access channels have concentrated on two methods: the use of virtual time clocks, and window splitting techniques. Virtual time clocks were first proposed by Molle and Kleinrock <ref> [MK85] </ref> and based on message arrival time. This has the advantage of making transmission of queued messages fairer.

Reference-contexts: We further impose a bound T which is the maximum number of slots a CRI may comprise. If T slot times are reached, all packets involved in the CRI are dropped, and the algorithm is reset. This CRA is analyzed in detail in <ref> [MS95] </ref> for constant initial laxities. Because of the laxity ordering, the first successful transmission during a CRI will be the lowest laxity packet, the second will be the second lowest, and so on, guaranteeing a laxity ordered transmission schedule appropriate in a real-time setting. <p> In the subsequent paragraphs we present the technique for analysis of time bounded CRAs with packets having variable laxity assignments. See Paterakis et al. [PGPK89] for the presentation of the original, fixed laxity assignment technique used to analyze their protocol, or <ref> [MS95] </ref> for our first exten sions to analyze the more involved fixed initial laxity, time bounded, and laxity ordered Gallager CRA. 3.1 Notation In this analysis, we make the assumption that initial packet laxities are drawn from a uniform distribution between 2 and T; inclusive.
