Abstract: Workflow Management (WM) is an emerging area that involves cross-disciplinary fields as Database, Software Engineering, Business Management, Human Coordination. A Workflow Management System (WMS) is a software tool to automate Business Processes (BPs) and coordinate people of an organization. BPs are a set of linked procedures concentrated on reaching a business goal, normally following a set of procedural rules. This work presents the OBJECTFLOW 1 project, result of the cooperation between an industrial partner, the Centro de Clculo de Sabadell (CCS, a software company located near Barcelona), and the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC). The main aim of OBJECTFLOW project is constructing a flexible WMS to automate BPs of the medium and big enterprise, allowing the integration to existing software systems. Several paradigms were used to design and develop the OBJECTFLOW WMS: from an architectural point of view, it is a Client Server application. For the analysis, design and programming of the software component, the Rumbaugh OMT methodology was used. As a WMS, it was designed to support different kinds of workflow applications, integrating legacy systems and compound documents. It is composed by four principal modules (the Designer, the Workflow Engine, the Admintool, and the Client Desktop ) and others secondary components. This WMS does not incorporate the latest result in WM research but shows a successful cooperation between a research group and a Software factory, producing a commercial sof t-ware tool.

Reference-contexts: It is the aut o-mation of a Business Process (BP) enabling the coordination among people, the distribution of information and documents and the integration of software applications, everything this a c-cording to a set of procedural rules. OBJECTFLOW is a project <ref> [1] </ref> comprised into the Pan European Project (PEP, a project from the company CCS), in which an integral business management system for medium or big corp orations has been created. Its main objective is the development of a Business Information Sy stem integrated and automated by workflow tools.

Reference-contexts: This work shows the architectural and related technological issues of the OBJECTFLOW WMS. The architecture of WMS was designed taking into account the Workflow Reference Model of the Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC) <ref> [2] </ref> and the principal modules are a Process Definition Tool (the Designer), a Workflow Engine , an Administration Tool (the Ad-mintool), and a user interface (the Client Desktop ). These modules are used to modeling, e n-acting, and managing Business Processes (BPs); and interacting with workflow participants, respectively. <p> Section 3 describes the architecture of the WMS. Section 4 presents conclusions. Appendix A shows a case of study where the different tools are applied. 2 Background As defined by the WfMC <ref> [2] </ref>, a workflow is the automation of a BP, in whole or part, during which documents, information or tasks are passed from one participant to another for action, according to a set of procedural rules. <p> With this representation, Cases are created for each new occurrence of the BP. The UPL language is a Visual Basic for Application like language designed to represent a Template and used in other CCS applications. A Template is a kind of graph, with six different types of nodes <ref> [2] </ref> (each of them represented by a graphical shape), and arcs connecting them. The most important node is the Responsibility, which has an associated role and task.

Reference-contexts: The modeling of Information System has focused on analyzing data flows and transformation, one issue of the success of WMS is that it allows to model data flows and transformation e x-tending computer use beyond transaction processing into human communication and coordin a-tion <ref> [3] </ref>. 3 Workflow Management is a discipline that emerged first in industry and later as a research area. The need to improve the efficiency in the organization and the possibility to model organiz a-tions as process-centered, automating these models, have promoted the development of WMSs.

Reference-contexts: The need to improve the efficiency in the organization and the possibility to model organiz a-tions as process-centered, automating these models, have promoted the development of WMSs. There are several successful applications reported in industry <ref> [4] </ref> and more than one hundred commercial products [5,6]. Also there are projects with both industry and research participation [7]. As a research area, there are four main fields: technology [8], conceptual modeling [9,10], organization [11] and methodology [12].

Reference-contexts: Tasks are composed by a set of a c-tivities. The worker who wants to take the Responsibility must accomplish the specified role or can be assigned directly to the Responsibility at design time. Each node has associated events <ref> [17] </ref>, as well as other events are produced when a Template is activated (users can generate instances of it) or deactivated (the Template cannot be longer i n-stanced). Events are also generated when a Case is created, suspended or resumed.

Reference-contexts: already explained benefits obtained by using ODBC drivers, are extended to UNIX applications, in this case, the workflow server. 3.2 Client Modules 3.2.1 Designer Designer is the component used to model BP, providing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which facilitates the description of Templates and the intuitive understanding of designs <ref> [18] </ref>. The output is a binary file or UPL code, interpretable by the workflow engine. The design env i-ronment provides all kind of graphical tools to improve productivity. Figure 4 shows the graphical interface of this module. 8 A graphical language is provided with the purpose to model a BP.
