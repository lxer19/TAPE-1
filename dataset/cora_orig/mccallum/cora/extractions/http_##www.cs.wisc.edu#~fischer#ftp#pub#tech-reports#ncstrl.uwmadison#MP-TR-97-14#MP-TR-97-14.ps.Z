Abstract: We present a new method for the solution of the box constrained variational inequality problem, BVIP for short. Basically, this method is a nonsmooth Newton method applied to a reformulation of BVIP as a system of nonsmooth equations involving the natural residual. The method is globalized by using the D-gap function. We show that the proposed algorithm is globally and fast locally convergent. Moreover, if the problem is described by an affine function, the algorithm has a finite termination property. Numerical results for some large-scale variational inequality problems are reported. 2 Current address (October 1, 1997 | September 30, 1998): Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin | Madison, 1210 West Dayton Street, 53706 Madison, WI; e-mail: kanzow@cs.wisc.edu.

We stress, however, that the proof is based on the fact that the squared natural residual has the same growth behaviour as the D-gap function, see Proposition 2.3.

Reference-contexts: This problem is also called the mixed complementarity problem, see <ref> [3, 4] </ref>, where the reader may also find a number of interesting applications of this problem.

In our numerical experiments, we replaced the standard Armijo rule in Step (S.3) of Algorithm 3.2 by a nonmonotone Armijo-rule [10]. We terminate the algorithm if kr (x k )k " holds for an iterate x k .

Reference-contexts: In fact, since the `mid' operator is a semismooth operator, we have the following results, which follow immediately from the fact that the composition of (strongly) semismooth functions is again (strongly) semismooth <ref> [13, 5] </ref>. Lemma 3.1 The natural residual r is semismooth. If, in addition, F 0 is locally Lipschitzian, then the natural residual r is strongly semismooth. Basically, the proposed algorithm is a nonsmooth Newton method [16] applied to the system of semismooth equations (2).

Reference-contexts: Finally we mention a finite termination property of the algorithm. The proof of this result can be carried out along the same lines as in <ref> [6] </ref> for the nonlinear complementarity problem. In particular, the proof heavily exploits the fact that the natural residual is piecewise smooth. Theorem 3.6 Let x fl be a b-regular solution of BVIP and F be an affine mapping.

Reference-contexts: Since this system is not differentiable, we have to take a nonsmooth Newton method. However, it is not a trivial matter to globalize the nonsmooth Newton method. The globalization we suggest is based on another reformulation of problem (1). We first recall that the regularized gap function <ref> [7] </ref> for problem (1) is given by g fl (x) := max fl kx yk 2 ; where fl &gt; 0 is any given parameter. <p> Since the expression in the curly brackets is a strictly concave quadratic function in y, it has a unique maximizer, which we denote y fl (x). In fact, it is easy to see that this maximizer is given by y fl (x) = IB x fl ! see <ref> [7] </ref>.

As shown in <ref> [12] </ref>, a stationary point x fl of the D-gap function is a solution of BVIP if the Jacobian matrix F 0 (x fl ) is a P -matrix. This assumption holds, in particular, if F itself is a uniform P -function. <p> This assumption holds, in particular, if F itself is a uniform P -function. Since the level sets of the D-gap function are compact for uniform P -functions (see <ref> [12] </ref>), it follows from Theorem 3.3 that, under this assumption, Algorithm 3.2 will generate a sequence that converges to the unique solution of BVIP. To establish a fast local convergence property of the algorithm, we first need a preliminary result.
