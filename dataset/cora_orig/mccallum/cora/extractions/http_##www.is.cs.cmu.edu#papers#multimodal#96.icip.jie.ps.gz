Title: Abstract  
Abstract: Low bitrate video tele-conferencing requires adapting algorithms that may work perfectly well in a high-bitrate situation. When a slow transmission rate is unacceptable, compromise must be reached among the demands of speed, bandwidth limits and image quality. In this paper we present an approach to low bitrate video teleconferencing by focusing attention on important information. We show that by selectively degrading the quality of less important regions, more important regions can be sent without loss of quality but with greatly reduced bandwidth requirements. A prototype system has been developed to demonstrate the concept. The experimental results show significant savings of required bandwidth for video subjected to the changes.

Reference-contexts: Although rapid progress has been made in technologies of digital communications, demand for data transmission bandwidth is too much for current systems. Very low bitrate tele-conferencing is another research field for addressing such a problem <ref> [1] </ref>. Video delivery depends not only on the bandwidth and data size, but also the network traffic. While sending the same amount of data via even the same network, different network traffic can result in different delivery times.

Reference-contexts: The implementation is to add a selection function on top of classical coding system and make no change on the original coder and network protocols. This new approach differs from the model-based coding approach <ref> [2] </ref> in that no model is needed at the receiver. In order to demonstrate the proposed approach, we have developed a face tracker-based tele-conferencing system.

Reference-contexts: In order to demonstrate the proposed approach, we have developed a face tracker-based tele-conferencing system. The system can automatically focus its attention on a given face found by a real-time face-tracker <ref> [3] </ref> and its adjustable surrounding area, which is then fed to the coding system and sent to the receiver. The face can be selected by a mouse click or finger pointing if a touch screen is used.

Reference-contexts: The window size can reect the network traffic. The image outside of the window will be either cropped or blurred. The preprocessed image is then fed to a tele-conferencing software package- vic, a real-time multimedia application for video conferencing over the Internet <ref> [4] </ref>. Some modifications have been made to make it send the selected images. The system has been successfully running in our lab across different Alpha and HP machines. We have performed several experiments to evaluate the system performance. <p> This requires the system to have the ability to estimate the motion while locating the face. Furthermore, to track faces outside a certain range the system needs to control the camera, e.g., panning, tilting, and zooming. We have developed a real-time face tracker <ref> [4] </ref>. The cameras panning, tilting, and zooming are controlled by the program. Analog video images are digitized by a framegrabber into RGB values. Three types of models have been employed in developing the system. First, a stochastic model is used to characterize skin-colors of human faces.

Reference-contexts: The technique is the use of feature-indicating interest images to focus attention on specific areas of the video imagery. The motivation comes from scientific studies on selective visual attention <ref> [5] </ref>. Humans outperform computers in many pattern recognition and navigation tasks. One explanation is that computers have to process all available information, whereas a human quickly focuses attention to the most important information without paying too much to less relevant information.

One of the largest branches of study has studied attention in static images [8] [9].

For a sequence of images, the process of focusing attention becomes more challenging because objects can move and change.
