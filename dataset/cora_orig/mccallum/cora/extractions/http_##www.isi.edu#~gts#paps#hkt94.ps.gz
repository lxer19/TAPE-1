Abstract: User mobility is rapidly becoming an important and popular feature in today's networks. This is especially evident in wireless/cellular environments. While useful and desirable, user mobility raises a number of important security-related issues and concerns. One of them is the issue of tracking mobile user's movements and current whereabouts. Ideally, no entity other than the user himself and a responsible authority in the user's home domain should know either the real identity or the current location of the mobile user. At present, environments supporting user mobility either do not address the problem at all or base their solutions on the specific hardware capabilities of the user's personal device, e.g., a cellular telephone. This paper discusses a wide range of issues related to anonymity in mobile environments, reviews current state-of-the-art approaches and proposes several potential solutions. Solutions vary in complexity, degree of protection and assumptions about the underlying environment.

Reference-contexts: The purpose of the latter is to establish (at the domain level) the necessary state for the mobile unit. In the course of registration, the mobile unit is authenticated with the direct aid of its home location (see <ref> [1, 5] </ref>) and a TMSI is assigned. However, authentication of the mobile involves its real identity (IMSI) communicated in the clear over the air link. In summary, the GSM design focuses on mobile unit's anonymity over the air link. The design offers no anonymity against the base stations.

Reference-contexts: Each MD-IS controls an area covered by a number of MDBS-s. Therefore, it only makes sense to discuss anonymity with respect to inter-area mobility. Upon arrival to a new area, the mobile unit first engages in a Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol <ref> [2] </ref> with the local MD-IS. As a result, both parties obtain a shared secret key. Subsequently, the mobile unit encrypts its real identity (Network Equipment Identifier - NEI) and transmits it to the local MD-IS. While seemingly more secure than GSM, the CDPD approach has two major drawbacks. <p> If the user is not equipped with a smartcard-like device, P W u is the user's password which he enters into the public workstation or some 6 The authentication protocol may be optionally preceded by a two-flow Diffie-Hellman <ref> [2] </ref> key exchange a la CDPD [4].In this case, the entire procedure becomes resistant to passive intruders since all messages can be enciphered under the new key. 7 The reason for different notation is that SUid may be, for example, an encrypted version of SUid. 8 In case of DES or

In the course of registration, the mobile unit is authenticated with the direct aid of its home location (see <ref> [1, 5] </ref>) and a TMSI is assigned. However, authentication of the mobile involves its real identity (IMSI) communicated in the clear over the air link. In summary, the GSM design focuses on mobile unit's anonymity over the air link. The design offers no anonymity against the base stations. <p> The authentication and temporary record establishment procedure can be abstracted as shown in Figure 1. 6 (See <ref> [5] </ref> for detailed protocol description.) The exact format of the authentication flows is not important in this context. Regardless of the authentication specifics, the identity of U x must be somehow communicated to AS x . <p> Finally, establishing the "real" identity of the mobile user is only half the work; AS x must then verify the authentication information supplied in the second flow. However, this is unrelated to the problem at hand. (See, for example, <ref> [5] </ref> for a treatment of this subject.) 6 Stronger Anonymity Solutions Although suitable for personal devices (smart-cards), the time-based anonymity approach described in the preceding section is truly appealing to an unarmed user, i.e., a user without any personal gadgets.

Reference-contexts: This is true of most, if not all, current mobile user environments. However, this assumption may not hold in the future. Increasing popularity of the electronic cash concept (pioneered by David Chaum <ref> [8, 9] </ref>) may eventually result in homeless mobile user environments. For example, a cellular telephone user, instead of subscribing with a particular service provider, may simply obtain some electronic cash at, say, a vending machine or a kiosk, and spend it piecemeal on making calls from anywhere he pleases.
