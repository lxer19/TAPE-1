Abstract: We have developed a multiagent robotic system including perception, cognition, and action components to function in a dynamic environment. The system involves the integration and coordination of a variety of diverse functional modules. At the sensing level, our complete multiagent robotic system incorporates detection and recognition algorithms to handle the motion of multiple mobile robots in a noisy environment. At the strategic and decision-making level, deliberative and reactive components take in the processed sensory inputs and select the appropriate actions to reach objectives under the dynamic and changing environmental conditions. At the actuator level, physical robotic effectors execute the motion commands generated by the cognition level. In this paper, we focus on presenting our approach for reactive visual control of multiple mobile robots. We present a tracking and prediction algorithm which handles visually homogeneous agents. We describe our non-holonomic control for single robot navigation, and show how it applies to dynamic path generation to avoid multiple moving obstacles. We illustrate our algorithms with examples from our real implementation. Using the approaches introduced, our robotic team won the RoboCup-97 small-size robot competition at IJCAI-97 in Nagoya, Japan.

Reference-contexts: Systems with on-board and off-board types have appeared in recent years. All have found that the reactiveness of soccer robots requires a vision system with a high processing cycle time. However, due to the rich visual input, researchers have found that dedicated processors or even DSPs are often needed <ref> [1, 9] </ref>. Our current system uses a frame-grabber with frame-rate transfer from a 3CCD camera. A relatively slow processor (166MHz Pentium) was at the heart of the vision system, performing all vision computations.

Reference-contexts: Robotic soccer offers a challenging research domain to investigate a large spectrum of issues of relevance to the development of complete autonomous agents <ref> [2, 7] </ref>. The fast-paced nature of the domain necessitates real-time sensing coupled with quick behaving and decision making.

Reference-contexts: However, the ad-vantage outweighs the disadvantage. To handle the possibility of failure, a failure recovery routine was devised. 4.1 Reactive Non-Holonomic Control The navigational movement control is done via reactive control. The control rules described below are inspired by the Braitenburg vehicle <ref> [3] </ref>. The Braitenburg love vehicle defines a reactive control mechanism that directs a differential-drive robot to a certain target. A similar behavior is required in the system; however, the love vehicle's control mechanism is too simplistic and, in some start configurations, tends to converge to the goal very slowly.

Reference-contexts: The ability to direct the ball in a given direction, and the ability to intercept a moving ball are all built on top of this simple behavior. The non-holonomic path planning problem has been addressed by many researchers, e.g., <ref> [8, 4] </ref>. However, most of the algorithms deal with static worlds and generate pre-planned global paths.

Reference-contexts: Like for real soccer players, it is often essential for robots to predict future locations of the ball (or even of the other players). We have used an Extended Kalman filter (EKF) for such a purpose <ref> [5] </ref>, which is very suitable since the detection of the ball's location is noisy. The EKF is a recursive estimator for a possibly nonlinear system. It involves a two-step iterative process, namely update and propagate.

In particular, we developed a dynamic path generation algorithm that applies to highly dynamic environments, such as robotic soccer. In the robotic soccer field, there are always multiple non-static obstacles between a robot and its target location.

Reference-contexts: This information is sent to an off-board controller and distributed to the different agent algorithms. Each agent evaluates the world state and uses its strategic knowledge to decide what to do next. Actions are motion commands that 1 For hardware details and specifications of the robots, please see <ref> [12] </ref>. are sent by the off-board controller through radio frequency communication. Commands can be broadcast or sent directly to individual agents. Each robot has an identification binary code that is used on-board to detect commands intended for that robot.
