Abstract: E. Yanagida recently proved that the classical Matukuma equation with a given exponent has only one finite mass solution. We show how similar ideas can be exploited to obtain uniqueness results for other classes of equations as well as Matukuma equations with more general coefficients. One particular example covered is u + u p u = 0, with p &gt; 1. The key ingredients of the method are energy functions and suitable transformations. We also study general boundary conditions, using an extension of a recent result by Bandle and Kwong. Yanagida's proof does not extend to solutions of Matukuma's equation satisfying other boundary conditions. We treat these with a completely different method of Kwong and Zhang.

Reference-contexts: For all values of n, the cutoff value of q for the first case is n=(n 2), whereas for n = 3, the value q = 1 is in a category by itself. Atkinson and Peletier <ref> [1] </ref> made a further study of the equation using the shooting method. They showed that when q &gt; 1, uniqueness is generally not true. Here we are concerned only with the case where the lower-order term u q is linear. The pertinent existence result in [3] follows.

Reference-contexts: L. Zhang has recently informed us that he also had solved the conjecture using a different method. Our result allows a coefficient in the linear term and covers Dirichlet problems on annular regions. 2 In Section 4 we first extend a result in Bandle and Kwong <ref> [2] </ref> to enable us to apply the preveious results to boundary value problems with more general homogeneous conditions. We also give other results for situations where the extended Bandle-Kwong theorem may not work. <p> The cases A = 1 and B = 1 are taken to mean the usual Dirchlet boundary conditions, u (a) = 0 and u (b) = 0, respectively. To this end, we first obtain an extension of a result by Bandle and Kwong <ref> [2] </ref>, who confirmed a conjecture raised and partially resolved by Coffman and Marcus in [7] concerning the universal uniqueness property of Dirchlet boundary value problems for superlinear equations: Suppose it is known that given any bounded interval (a; b), the Dirichlet problem has a unique positive solution. <p> Then the Neumann-Dirichlet problem has also a unique solution. In our improved version, we replaced the second boundary value problem by any Robin problem, and we require only the uniqueness of the Dirchlet problem for one suitable interval. Our proof is different from that in <ref> [2] </ref>. We formulate our result for second-order equations of the Emden-Fowler type, namely, those in which u 0 does not appear explicitly. There is no loss of generality since a change of the independent variable can transform more general equations into this type. <p> When the interval is sufficiently short, this situation is known to be valid. For the simpler equation u + f (u) = 0, this fact is implied by Theorem 1.7 of Ni and Nussbaum [20]. Lemma 12 in <ref> [2] </ref> confirms this assertion for general equations. A continuation argument then lets us extend this assertion to general (a; b) provided we can show that under no circumstances can w (r) have exactly one zero inside (a; b) and w (b) = 0.

Reference-contexts: Hence our result here applies to both (3.1) and (3.2).

A situation in which the extendability hypothesis of Theorem 4 may not be automatically guaranteed by the form of the equations in Theorem 6 arises when the coefficient g (x) of (2.1) is negative. <p> The required property of w (r) can be proved by examining the oscillatory behavior of w (r) in each of the subintervals (0; ae) and (ae; b). By Theorem 1 of <ref> [14] </ref>, the monotonicity of r 2 q (r) in (0; ae) implies that w (r) cannot change sign in (0; ae). On the other hand, Theorem 12 implies that w (r) cannot change sign in (ae; b). <p> Hence the only change of sign occurs at ae, and uniqueness of the Dirichlet problem is established. Example 3. The equation u 00 (x) + x 4 (u 5 + u) = 0 (7:7) has been shown in <ref> [14] </ref> to have the uniqueness property for Dirichlet problems.

A simple example is f (u) = u p u q , with p &gt; q &gt; 1. <p> Yanagida's technique does not appear to be extendable to general boundary conditions. The main obstacle is that (5.12) and (5.13) are no longer valid. The method also fails to include supercritical p. Instead we turn to an alternative approach that Kwong and Zhang <ref> [15] </ref> recently applied to equations of the form u + f (u) = 0. We will derive several uniqueness criteria. The first is a stronger form of (5.9). We require that (5.9) holds for all j &gt; 0, not just for the particular one given by (5.6). <p> It is easy to see that an equivalent condition is rq 0 (r) is nonincreasing in (a; b): (6:4) 26 This is reminiscent of the condition imposed on f (u) in <ref> [15] </ref>.

The ideas will only be sketched since the method is similar to that of the result in [15]. <p> Lemma 12 in [2] confirms this assertion for general equations. A continuation argument then lets us extend this assertion to general (a; b) provided we can show that under no circumstances can w (r) have exactly one zero inside (a; b) and w (b) = 0. In <ref> [15] </ref>, this crucial step is implemented by establishing Lemma 7, which is stated below in a more general form. Lemma 2 Suppose that w (b) = 0 and that w (r) has only one zero ae inside (a; b). <p> If we can construct a suitable function z (r) satisfying (6.7), with z (a) &gt; 0 but z (b) &lt; 0, then Lemma 2 implies that w (r) cannot have a zero at b, and the uniqueness proof is complete. In <ref> [15] </ref>, the function z = ru 0 + fiu, with a suitable choice of the constant fi was used. <p> In the case that = 1, the first two types are void. To close the section, we point out a major difference between the result here and that obtained in <ref> [15] </ref> and indicate some further extensions. What the proof exploits is the sign property, not the actual magnitude, of the righthand side of (6.7).

In [15], the righthand side of the corresponding (6.7) has the required sign property only if we know that u (r) is nonincreasing in the interval [a; b]. For this reason, the result there is only established when a Neumann condition is satisfied at the left endpoint a. <p> For this reason, the result there is only established when a Neumann condition is satisfied at the left endpoint a.

Yanagida [24] gave an affirmative answer to the conjecture concerning the uniqueness of the solution with finite mass in the special case that q (r) = 1=(1 + r 2 ). His proof actually works without much change for more general coefficients.

Reference-contexts: This equation was first proposed by Matukuma [18] as a mathematical model of a globular cluster of stars. The question of existence and symmetry properties of ground states has been studied extensively by Li and Ni [16, 17], Ni and Yotsutani [21], and Noussair and Swanson <ref> [22] </ref>. Yanagida's uniqueness proof made some innovative use of the Pohozaev identity. The complexity of the identity, however, has not helped to elucidate the ingenious underlying arguments. We find that similar techniques are applicable to a wider class of problems. We give several examples in this paper.

Reference-contexts: It is also easy to see that if q (r) satisfies (6.4), so does q (1=r). Coefficients of the form q (r) = ff + 1 + r 2 ; ff &gt; 0; (6:14) have been studied by Toland <ref> [23] </ref>. However, the condition (6.4) is not satisfied unless b is small. Theorem 3 of Section 3 also fails. It is interesting to ask whether uniqueness is still valid for these equations. Theorem 10 furnishes a complete description on the structure of the solutions of the Matukuma equation.

Reference-contexts: The existence of each type of solution and its dependence on the initial height u (0) were studied in great detail by Ni and Yotustani [21].

By virtue of superlinear-ity, we see that (s) must intersect OE (s) at least once. As in <ref> [24] </ref>, we proceed to show that OE (s) and (s) cannot intersect for a second time. Suppose they do.
