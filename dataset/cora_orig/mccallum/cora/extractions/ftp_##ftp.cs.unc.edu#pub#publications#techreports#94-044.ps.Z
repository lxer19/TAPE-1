Abstract: We propose an object-based interpolation that utilizes the core, a multiscale representation of object shape, as the basis for determining an interpolated object's position and intensities. The core calculations are made directly from image intensities, with no intermediate location of object boundaries. The core of the interpolated object is first determined by an interpolation of the cores of the corresponding objects. The intensity at each of the positions in the object specified by the interpolated core is then determined by interpolating intensities from the equivalent positions in the corresponding objects; positions with equivalent distances along and from the core are chosen via the algorithm described in the paper. This object-based geography has produced promising results for simple, single-core interobject interpolations , and research continues in determining an interpolation method for multi-figure objects as well as the background positions in realistic medical images. The three-dimensional surface or volume renderings of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging data utilized in anatomical visualization are invariably computed from a sequence of two-dimensional transaxial cross-sections, or slices. Because the distance between the sampled slices is often greater than the inter-pixel resolution within the slices, initial processing of the three-dimensional data set in the form of inter-slice interpolation is frequently necessitated in order to resample the data at arbitrary resolutions and obtain a subsequently more accurate or efficient rendering of the data. Anatomical structures change size and position along the axial dimension, and the slices in the acquired data contain two-dimensional objects which are a sampling of those structures. The interpolation of inter-slice data thus ought to consist of interpolating between the objects in the sampled slices. Simple greyscale interpolation along the axial dimension, where the intensity at the k th pixel is interpolated from the intensities at the k th pixels in adjacent slices, or related methods using bilinear or spline interpolations on larger intra- or inter-slice neighborhoods, are inadequate because they fail to explicitly recognize and interpolate between the objects in the slices. Raya and Udupa 1 first proposed the notion of a shape-based interpolation. Their approach computes a distance transform of a binary image, and labels distances within the object as positive and outside the object as negative. These boundary distances are then interpolated and thresholded at zero to obtain a binary, interpolated image that is relatively
