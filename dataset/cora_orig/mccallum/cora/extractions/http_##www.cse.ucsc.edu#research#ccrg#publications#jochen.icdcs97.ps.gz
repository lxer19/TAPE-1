Abstract: Routing protocols based on the distribution of link-state information rely on sequence numbers to validate information that a router receives. A fundamental problem is to bound the sequence-number space. We propose a new sequence-number reset algorithm that needs neither periodic retransmissions nor age fields. It is based on a recursive query-response procedure and is designed to handle resource failures during operation. This new algorithm is applicable to routing protocols based on both flooding and selective distribution of link-state information. The correctness of the algorithm is verified in the context of selective dissemination of topology information, and its complexity analyzed. Because the reset algorithm does not use any aging, the distribution of new link-state information or the purging of old information is always done in a time proportional to the time it takes to traverse the network.

Reference-contexts: The latency of our algorithm is bounded only by the time it takes for an LSU to traverse the network, rather than by a global timer, which is the case in all previous reset schemes used or proposed to date (e.g., see <ref> [13, 1] </ref>). The following section states the goals for our reset mechanism. Section 3 describes the new reset algorithm in the context of flooding as well as selective diffusing of topology information. <p> A reset algorithm for IFP with goals similar to the above three has been sketched in <ref> [1] </ref>. According to this algorithm, whenever the sequence number of an LSU reaches its upper bound at some router, this router makes a reset request. When a request reaches a router other than the source, that router resets its sequence number to 0 and forwards the request.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 2 Upon termination of a diffusing computation for a given link (i; j), the information about the link is consistent throughout the network, i.e., any node in the network has the correct information. The proof of this theorem is based on a series of lemmas <ref> [2] </ref> showing that * Any node with information about the link will receive a query. * After termination, all nodes have consistent informa tion about (i; j). * All information about (i; j) will be removed in a dis connected component. * A diffusing computation started in a seemingly disconnected part

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Disseminating link-state (topology) information reliably is essential to many internet routing protocols proposed or implemented to date. This dissemination can take the form of broadcast, in which every network node (router) maintains the same topology map <ref> [3] </ref>, or selective distribution, in which each node maintains only the subset of the topology map it needs to perform correct routing [7]. <p> When the source of the LSU receives the request, it sets its sequence number to 1 and broadcasts its most recent LSU. This type of reset has two problems: erroneous LSU information has to propagate all the way to the source before it can be erased <ref> [3] </ref>. Other than having a global timer, there is no provision for erasing an obsolete LSU after the failure of the source of the LSU or the partition of the network.

Reference-contexts: This paper focuses on flooding because of its simplicity and popularity. Examples of standard internet routing protocols based on the flooding of link states are OSPF [10], IS-IS [9] and NLSP [11]. In addition, the inter-domain policy routing (IDPR) architecture [6] and the Nim-rod architecture for scalable internet routing <ref> [4] </ref> are both based on flooding. These protocols and architectures use the same basic approach for the flooding of topology information, which we simply call intelligent flooding protocol or IFP in the rest of this paper (e.g., see [12, 13]).

Reference-contexts: We propose a new algorithm that achieves fast dissemination of up-to-date link-state information without periodic updates or age fields. This algorithm is based on a finite and linear sequence-number space and diffusing computations <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> Queries have the same fields as an LSU. Replies do not need to transmit link information, but may carry a tag signaling the possibility of an error. Based on these queries and replies, our reset algorithm operates in a manner very similar to Dijkstra and Scholten's algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>. A node that needs to reliably distribute information about a link through the network and detect the termination of this, sends queries instead of LSUs to all its neighbors and then waits until it receives a reply from each neighbor.

Reference-contexts: This dissemination can take the form of broadcast, in which every network node (router) maintains the same topology map [3], or selective distribution, in which each node maintains only the subset of the topology map it needs to perform correct routing <ref> [7] </ref>. <p> It must be ensured that nodes age LSUs at a similar pace, and LSUs must be sent reliably between neighbors. The link-vector algorithm (LVA) introduced in <ref> [7] </ref> is based on the selective distribution of topology information, rather than on flooding. The purpose of this algorithm is to allow a router to maintain only the link-state information it needs to reach a destination, rather than the entire topology map. <p> In addition, the router tells its neighbors which links it no longer uses to reach destinations. A basic assumption for the correct operation of the LVA implementation introduced in <ref> [7] </ref> is that routers can determine whether an update contains up-to-date information using the same update validation scheme used for LSUs in IFP. <p> With LVA, this extra query is used to update the set of reporting nodes at the predecessor node. On the other hand, with IFP, the worst case always occurs because the whole network is flooded with the information, while LVA produces fewer messages in the average case <ref> [7] </ref>. 5.2 Time and Storage Complexity In the connected component of the network, the worst-case time complexity is O (x), where x is the number of affected routers. With IFP, x obviously is the number of nodes in the network, while with LVA it can be significantly less.
