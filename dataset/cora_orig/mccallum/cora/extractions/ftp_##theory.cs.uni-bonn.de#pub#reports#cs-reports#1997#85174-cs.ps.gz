Reference-contexts: Sauer's Lemma (cf., e. g., [AB92]) says: Lemma 2: If n d, C (n) &lt; i d Thus C (n) has polynomial growth. Because of this there is clear interest in the infimum of all reals r such that C (n)=n r is bounded (as n ! 1). Dudley <ref> [D84] </ref> calls this r dens (C), the density of C. 3.4 Probabilistic Considerations As above, C has finite VC-dimension d. Let be a probability distribution on X, and, for m 1, m the product distribution on X m (to be construed as the space of ordered m-samples from X). <p> See <ref> [D84] </ref> and [P84] for discussion of this kind of point, and methods of solution. We will follow Pollard's Appendix C. <p> In the real case we integrate real functions, but in the p-adic case we integrate also real functions, typically jg (x)j s , where g is a p-adic valued function and s a real variable (as in p-adic Poincare' series <ref> [D84] </ref>). 8.2 In the real case, if f 0 we can of course express R f as the volume "under the graph of f ", but for the VC-methods the probabilities would be against the measure R f d, and could be reduced to estimates using a nonzero lower bound for <p> The notion of expressing an "-approximate integral is the obvious analogue of that for volume. The translation argument goes through, and Hoeffding's Inequality (cf. Lemma 12) still applies. In the p-adic case, too, there is no real change. 8.6 Remark about Poincare series By [M76], <ref> [D84] </ref> the maps s 7! jf (x; ~ff)j s d are, uniformly in ~ff, rational functions of p s . It is, however, not at all obvious how to bound the complexity of such rational functions. If one knew this, one could interpolate the functions in the style of [GKS94].

Reference-contexts: Henceforward when we discuss any language for IR, &lt; will be a primitive. Similarly, for the Q p there are compelling reasons for taking as primitives each: P k (x) () (9y)(y k = x) see <ref> [M76, D86] </ref>. Again, in any discussion of Q p , these are taken as primitive. For the finite extensions of Q p , see [PR84] for the appropriate modification. <p> For example, the language of exponentiation interprets the absolute metric in hyperbolic geometry, as well as many topics about sigmoidal neural nets. The p-adic case, via Poincare series, is of considerable interest in number theory and Lie theory <ref> [D86, S93] </ref>. 6 Approximate Definitions of Haar measure 6.1 The results now to be described overlap significantly with those of Koiran [K95], but were independently obtained (see Section 1). The goal was to see if (' ~ fi ) could be obtained "in first-order terms" .

Reference-contexts: It has become clear in the last thirty years that there are strong metamathematical resemblences too [M86].

Lemma 11: In an o-minimal theory on IR, any definable set A in IR n is a Boolean combination of definable closed sets.

Corollary: For any k 1 any o-minimal system on IR admits quantifier-elimination in terms of total C k functions. Proof: Clear. This allows us to make full use of a method from [KM97a].

Reference-contexts: Finally, there are significant problems about finite fields.

But one may reasonably hope to discover the dependence on p, both for VC and for density.

Reference-contexts: We have not seen his proof, which we suspect is more combinatorial than ours. In the case of quantifier-free Pfaffian formulas, our method in [KM97a] gives a very sharp result. We only recently realized, in writing <ref> [KM97b] </ref>, that our axiomatic development there is almost good enough to handle the general case. The result is: Theorem 10: Let ( 1 ; : : : ; k ; y 1 ; : : : ; y ` ) be a formula in an o-minimal theory on IR. <p> Problem 1: (cf. 6.1) Extend the result of [KM97a], bounding VC-dimension in the quantifier-free Pfaffian case, to a relative Pfaffian case of the type analyzed in <ref> [KM97b] </ref>. Abstractly, we know how to do this. The q (q 1)=2 term in [K91] is the degree of a certain iteration of the Jacobian, and in any given relativization we could work this out.

Reference-contexts: Van den Dries and Denef [DD88] revealed a striking analogy between IR and the p-adic fields at the level of suban-alytic sets.

This research was also motivated by the problems of estimating the VC-dimension of neural networks. <p> In this paper we concentrate on combinatorial and probabilistic notions which make sense for all the locally compact K. 3.2 VC-Dimension We assume familiarity with the basics about VC dimension ([BEHW90], [V82], <ref> [L92] </ref>, [GJ93], [KM97a]).
