Title: Evolving Robot Behaviours with Diffusing Gas Networks  
Author: Phil Husbands 
Address: Brighton, UK  
Affiliation: School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences and Centre for Computational Neuroscience and Robotics University of Sussex,  
Abstract: This paper introduces a new type of artificial nervous system and shows that it is possible to use evolutionary computing techniques to find robot controllers based on them. The controllers are built from networks inspired by the modulatory effects of freely diffusing gases, especially nitric oxide, in real neuronal networks. Using Jakobi's radical minimal simulations, successful behaviours have been consistently evolved in far fewer evaluations than were needed when using more conventional connectionist style networks. Indeed the reduction is by a factor of roughly one order of magnitude.

Reference-contexts: These networks can be envisaged as simple nodes connected together by directional wires along which signals flow. The nodes perform an input output mapping that is usually some sort of sigmoid function [7]. Occasionally a simple differential equation is used instead, providing the possibility of richer dynamics <ref> [1] </ref>. Some have used feed-forward architectures, others have explored more free form arbitrarily recurrent networks. The original inspiration for all these styles of network is the neuro-science of the 1940s and 1950s. They abstract something of the electrical properties and behaviours of real neuronal networks.

Reference-contexts: Among others, Brooks and colleagues went some way down that path by using ideas gleaned from some of the properties of the lobster hormonal system <ref> [2] </ref>. As far as the author of this paper is concerned, current understandings of nervous systems seem to suggest that a useful abstract way to think of them is in terms of several interacting classes of dynamical processes, each with distinct characteristics (e.g. electrical, short-range chemical, long-range chemical) 1 .

Reference-contexts: of generating adaptive behaviours in autonomous robots of a kind that is much more sophisticated than we can manage today? Even if they are, will it be possible to find the networks in question, through evolutionary search or some other technique? As has been pointed out by various people (e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>), advances in neuroscience have made it clear that the propagation of action potentials, and the changing of synaptic connection strengths, is only a very small part of the story of the brain (e.g [16]).

Reference-contexts: This basic encoding can be used to search for network topologies and geometries with a fixed number of nodes, or a dynamic length version can be used to evolve networks in a more open-ended way <ref> [6] </ref>. Of course, the use of the segments to determine the connectivity means the number of connections, and hence the basic architecture, is never fixed. To say nothing of the additional dynamic properties introduced by the diffusing gases.

Reference-contexts: Developing networks on a 2D plane has a number of advantages as discussed in [11]. The idea of using a plane has been previously explored by at least Husbands <ref> [8] </ref>, Nolfi [15] and Jakobi [10]. Of course, in this case the geometry of the network is crucial to the workings of the gas diffusion, so the networks have to exist on a plane. This particular encoding is directly inspired by Jakobi's [11].

Reference-contexts: The left hand side is connected to the Khepera's left hand sensors and motor, the right hand side is connected to the Khepera's right hand sensors and motor. One predetermined node for each sensor and motor. A distributed, or diffusion, GA of the kind described in <ref> [9] </ref> was used. It employed a population of 225 spread out over a 15x15 grid with overlapping Gaussian local neighbourhoods, in which local selection rules operated. Standard one point crossover was used with a probability of 0.9. Mutation operated as follows.

Reference-contexts: When the gases were removed all together, it was not possible to evolve successful controllers within 500 generations. Since the gases are the agents of a form of plasticity in the networks, these observations suggest that the Baldwin effect <ref> [14] </ref> is at play, albeit a rather different form than has been observed before. This will need further investigation. Many different successful behaviour generating mechanisms were observed. The evolved controller shown in figure 4 represents a class of mechanisms, making use of the gases, of which several examples were seen.
