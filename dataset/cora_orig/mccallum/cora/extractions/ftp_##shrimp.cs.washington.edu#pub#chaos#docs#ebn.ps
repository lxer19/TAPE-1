Abstract: We present the Express Broadcast Network (EBN), a network used for quick and reliable broadcast of control messages in multicomputer networks. The EBN can be implemented with a single extra wire per network link and with minimal extra hardware at each routing node. However, it provides very fast broadcast mechanisms that take advantage of all redundancy in the network to deliver messages regardless of faulty network components. We present extensions of the basic network to include multiple-wire, multiple-bit, and bidirectional wire support, as well as describing basic methods of using the EBN for various applications.

Reference-contexts: A failure on a link causes loss of communication to all of its descendants. Furthermore, the only node that can broadcast in this tree is the single source node. Cray Research's T3D uses a special network to implement barrier synchronization and broadcast primitives using static trees <ref> [2] </ref>. This allows multiple source nodes, but still suffers from single-point failures. To avoid these problems, the EBN incorporates a dynamic redundant tree structure. The EBN tree structure is dynamic in that any node may become the root of the broadcast tree at will. <p> This is shown in network despite the presence of faults. The EBN has, in its simplest form, two basic communication primitives: eurekas and barriers. Eurekas <ref> [2] </ref> are one-to-all broadcast messages and are used when the entire network is waiting for a single event. Barriers are used when the network is waiting for all nodes to experience a common event. Barriers can be implemented by hav message to all of its neighbors.

Reference-contexts: The Thinking Machines CM-5 computer includes three distinct physical networks: a data network, a control network, and a diagnostic network [4]. The Fujitsu AP1000 also has three networks, one for data, one for control broadcasting, and one for synchronization <ref> [3] </ref>. However, the additional hardware needed to build three separate high-bandwidth networks is very costly. IBM's Vulcan architecture uses a virtual broadcast network built on top of the data network's links to implement its fault-tolerance mechanisms [5].

Reference-contexts: However, the additional hardware needed to build three separate high-bandwidth networks is very costly. IBM's Vulcan architecture uses a virtual broadcast network built on top of the data network's links to implement its fault-tolerance mechanisms <ref> [5] </ref>. Unfortunately, adding a virtual network on top of the existing network complicates the critical path of the network routers. Thus, a low-cost, but physically separate control network is needed for a large-scale machine. <p> The Chaos Fault Tolerant Router utilizes various operational modes of the EBN. In the Normal Operation state, any router may signal a possible error condition by broadcasting, via the EBN, an error-detected eureka signal. This is similar to the function of the global faulting mechanism in the Vulcan architecture <ref> [5] </ref>. At this point the routers enter the System Drain state, and all the nodes cease injection of new packets into the data network in order to drain the system. Completion of the system drain is detected by a barrier waiting for all nodes to drain.
