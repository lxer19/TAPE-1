Abstract: We consider the following adversarial situation. Let n, m and t be arbitrary integers, and let f : f0; 1g n 7! f0; 1g m be a function. An adversary, knowing the function f, sets t of the n input bits, while the rest (n t input bits) are chosen at random (independently and with uniform probability distribution). The adversary tries to prevent the outcome of f from being uniformly distributed in f0; 1g m . The question addressed is for what values of n, m and t does the adversary necessarily fail in biasing the outcome of f : f0; 1g n 7! f0; 1g m , when being restricted to set t of the input bits of f . We present various lower and upper bounds on m's allowing an affirmative answer. These bounds are relatively close for t n=3 and for t 2n=3. Our results have applications in the fields of fault-tolerance and cryptography.
