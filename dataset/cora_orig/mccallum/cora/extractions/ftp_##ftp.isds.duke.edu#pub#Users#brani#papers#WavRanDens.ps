Title: A NOTE ON RANDOM DENSITIES VIA WAVELETS  
Author: By Brani Vidakovic 
Keyword: Key words and phrases: Wavelets, Parseval's Identity, Random density.  
Affiliation: Duke University  
Abstract: It is a well known fact that any orthonormal basis in L 2 can produce a "random density". If f n g is an orthonormal basis and fa n g is a sequence of random variables such that a 2 n = 1 a.s., then f(x) = ja n n (x)j 2 is a random density. In this note we define a random density via orthogonal bases of wavelets and explore some of its basic properties.
