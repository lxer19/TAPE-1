Title: The Rutgers CAP Project Design Associate  
Author: Thomas Ellman John Keane Mark Schwabacher 
Date: August 1992  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science Rutgers University  
Pubnum: CAP-TR-7  
Abstract: The Design Associate is intended to be an interactive environment that supports decision-making, performance evaluation, design-record management and knowledge acquisition tasks. The system is specifically intended to handle the design of complex, physical structures, such as ships and planes, among others. Two key difficulties characterize this class of design problems: (1) Design goals depend on global properties of an artifact. (2) Evaluation of the performance of an artifact is computationally expen sive. The Design Associate provides a set of tools for attacking each of these problems: Global constraints are attacked by methods of automatically abstracting and decomposing search spaces. Computational costs of evaluation are attacked by methods of intelligently selecting evaluation models at varying levels of approximation. Future work will extend the Design Associate by building a Model Associate for automatically generating new performance evaluation models. This extension is intended to support innovative design by diminishing the time and monetary costs of developing new models needed to evaluate radically new designs. Research on the Design Associate is expected to contribute to the field of Computer-Aided Design by formalizing the generic task structure of complex, physical structure design. It is also expected to contribute to the field of Artificial Intelligence, by attacking problems such as search control, search space formulation, abstraction, decomposition, model selection and model formation. fl The research reported in this paper was supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), under DARPA-funded NASA grant No. NAG 2-645. This research has benefited from numerous discussions with all members of the Rutgers CAP project, including Saul Amarel, Andrew Gelsey, Haym Hirsh, Chun Liew, Ringo Ling, Gerry Richter, Louis Steinberg, Chris Tong and Ke-Thia Yao.

Reference-contexts: As a contribution to Computer-Aided Design, this research is aimed at formalizing the generic task structure <ref> [ Chandrasekaran, 1986 ] </ref> of a class of design problems: the design of complex, physical structures. In particular, it aims to identify the principal tasks that arise in such design problems, as well as the flow of control among these tasks.

Reference-contexts: It requires that the "rating" of each yacht be at most "12 meters". Ratings of yachts are determined by a complex set of rules known as the "International Measurement System" devised by the Offshore Racing Council <ref> [ Council, 1991 ] </ref> . The Design Associate estimates the rating of a yacht using a simplified formula depending on a few major geometric measurements of the yacht hull. Finally, a cost goal is specified by providing an upper bound on the cost of building the yacht.

Reference-contexts: Thus by intelligently deciding when to reuse prior evaluation results, the Design Associate can achieve considerable savings in the computational costs of design. 2 The role of PMARC and computational fluid dynamics in the Design Associate is discussed in <ref> [ Gelsey, 1992 ] </ref> . <p> Expected properties of the outputs also be represented formally and used to perform "sanity checking" on the data generated by running the model <ref> [ Gelsey, 1992 ] </ref> . Sensitivity information will be represented formally and used to guide Operator Analysis 22 as described in Section 3, and to guide model selection as described in Section 4.

Reference-contexts: An example of a 12-meter yacht, the Stars and Stripes '87, is shown in Figure 1. This yacht figures prominently in the history of America's Cup racing. In particular, it won the America's cup back from Australia in 1987 <ref> [ Letcher et al., 1987 ] </ref> . The Design Associate is being developed with an eye toward reconstructing the design process that led to the Stars and Stripes '87 yacht. Racing yachts can be designed to meet a variety of objectives.

Reference-contexts: In the Design Associate, the course time is estimated using a velocity prediction program, called "VPP" <ref> [ Letcher, 1991 ] </ref> . The rating goal is imposed by the authorities who manage the America's Cup races. It requires that the "rating" of each yacht be at most "12 meters". <p> For example, suppose a designer were to consider a novel yacht architecture having two keels rather than one. The performance of such a novel design could not be evaluated using standard velocity prediction programs such as the Aero/Hydro VPP program <ref> [ Letcher, 1991 ] </ref> . This program incorporates a variety of simplifying assumptions that limit its applicability to relatively standard yacht designs, in particular, yachts having a single keel. When a designer wants to consider such a novel design, he must recognize when the available evaluation models are not appropriate.

Reference-contexts: Of all the quantities appearing in the design goals, course time is the most difficult to evaluate. The VPP program that performs this task is described in Figure 3. VPP takes as input a set of B-Spline surfaces representing the geometry of the yacht hull <ref> [ Rogers and Adams, 1990 ] </ref> . Each surface is itself represented as a matrix of "control points" that define its shape.
