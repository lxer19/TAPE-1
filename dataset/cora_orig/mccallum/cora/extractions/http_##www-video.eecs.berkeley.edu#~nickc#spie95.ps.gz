Abstract: In previous work, Cobb and Zakhor[1] developed an automated mask design algorithm using optimization to produce masks which can print at smaller feature sizes. In this work, we build upon our previous approach with special regard to computational efficiency and mask manufacturability to produce an Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) algorithm which operates orders of magnitude faster and produces simpler optimized masks. The algorithm can be used for OPC of Manhattan geometry masks for which phase assignment has been previously completed. Therefore, the OPC problem is divorced from phase-mask design and the two tasks are performed independently. Our algorithm decomposes the mask features into edges and corners which can be moved from their original placements to improve the image characteristics. The resulting optimization algorithm inherently requires computation of O( 3 o ) where o is the density of edges and corners on the mask. A major feature of the algorithm is a new fast intensity computation technique which uses lookup tables to achieve single point intensity computation on the order of O(N a M r ) where N a is the order of approximation to the optical system and M r is the number of rectangles in the mask region description. The single point intensity computation time is typically around 300sec for fairly complicated masks on an HP 700 series workstation. The resulting algorithm optimized a 36 fi36 m 2 test mask in 6 iterations at 11 seconds per iteration pass on the same machine. The new techniques make the described algorithm viable for a production environment with k 1 as low as k 1 = 0:4.

Reference-contexts: Rieger and Stirniman [8] use experimental data to construct a lumped-model of various proximity effects from which corrections are decided. Our approach builds upon our previous work <ref> [1] </ref> which performs optimization of simulated optical data to decide mask modifications on phase-assigned Manhattan geometry masks. The simulations use a parametric model of the optical system to compute intensity. Geometrically, the technique is constrained to produce relatively simple masks. <p> Since the cost function requires knowledge of the intensity at the various control points, a fast intensity calculation method is developed in the next section. 3 Fast Sparse Intensity Point Calculation In this section, the previously encountered idea of mask windowing <ref> [1] </ref> is combined with a new lookup table method to produce a fast intensity computation engine. Any speedup in intensity computation is a direct speedup to the entire optimization algorithm since the algorithm requires intensity calculations for every cost function evaluation. <p> the entire mask at any point during optimization is described by: M = p2P f X s p t p 1 p (7) and the initial mask is obtained by letting the second summation be zero. 3.2 Windowing The intensity calculation can be simplified by introducing windowing of the mask <ref> [1] </ref>. By windowing out a section of the mask, the intensity in a given region or point can be computed without considering the entire mask. As an illustrative example, refer to Figure 5 where the intensity of the marked control point triplet is desired. <p> The SPLAT formulation requires three operations in order to compute the intensity: (1) Fourier series expansion of mask region (2) correlation operation similar to convolution and (3) inverse Fourier Series, which can be performed at a total cost of O (M 2 M r + M 4 ) operations <ref> [1] </ref> for M r rectangles in the windowed mask area and M Fourier harmonics.

Reference-contexts: This region might correspond to a windowed area of mask if the windowing technique described previously is being used. First, we consider the 1-D case. By periodicizing the length L x mask, and taking its Fourier series expansion ~ G (n), as done by Flanner <ref> [2] </ref> we obtain the following expression for the Fourier series of the resulting periodic intensity, ~ I (): ~ I (n) = n 0 (a) (b) rectangles Suppose that the transmission cross coefficient function ~ T (n 0 ; n 00 ) can be approximated by: ~ T (n 0 ; <p> The error properties of this approximation are discussed further by Pati and Kailath [7]. The lookup table method can be compared to the Hopkins frequency domain model for partially coherent imaging as implemented in the SPLAT program <ref> [2, 9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The rule-based techniques of Otto et al. [6] can use experimental data to supplement simulation data in order to "anchor" simulated data to the particular lithography system in use. The model- based approach of Pati and Kailath <ref> [7] </ref> combines OPC with phase-shift mask design and employs a pixel mask model to solve a signal processing inverse problem to obtain their phase-shift mask design. <p> The premise behind the lookup table method is that the partially coherent imaging system can be approximated by a finite sum of squared outputs from N a linear systems, as done by Pati and Kailath <ref> [7] </ref>. Because of this, the mask can be decomposed into basic patterns for which the outputs of the linear systems are known in advance and stored in lookup tables. This saves considerable time in computing the intensity at a desired point. <p> We call this an N a th order approximation. Such an approximation is achieved using eigenfunction decomposition as shown by Pati and Kailath <ref> [7] </ref>. <p> Although 2% is already accurate enough for the needs here, it should be noted that this error can be pushed arbitrarily low in exchange for more computation time by increasing the approximation order N a . The error properties of this approximation are discussed further by Pati and Kailath <ref> [7] </ref>. The lookup table method can be compared to the Hopkins frequency domain model for partially coherent imaging as implemented in the SPLAT program [2, 9].
