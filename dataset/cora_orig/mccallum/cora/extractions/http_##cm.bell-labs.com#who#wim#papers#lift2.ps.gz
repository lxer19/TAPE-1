Title: THE LIFTING SCHEME: A CONSTRUCTION OF SECOND GENERATION WAVELETS  
Author: WIM SWELDENS 
Keyword: Key words. wavelet, multiresolution, second generation wavelet, lifting scheme  
Note: AMS subject classifications. 42C15  
Abstract: We present the lifting scheme, a simple construction of second generation wavelets, wavelets that are not necessarily translates and dilates of one fixed function. Such wavelets can be adapted to intervals, domains, surfaces, weights, and irregular samples. We show how the lifting scheme leads to a faster, in-place calculation of the wavelet transform. Several examples are included. 1. Introduction. Wavelets form a versatile tool for representing general functions or data sets. Essentially we can think of them as data building blocks. Their

Reference-contexts: As pointed out earlier, lifting does not guarantee these conditions and they have to be verified in each particular case. 14.5. Recursive wavelets. The principle of recursive wavelets is explained in <ref> [8, 56] </ref>. The basic idea is not to use the cascade algorithm ad infinitum to construct the scaling functions, but instead fix the scaling functions on an arbitrary finest level n. This can be generalized easily to the second generation case. <p> In other words, one has to use adaptive grids to obtain the correct convergence order. There is another important application of wavelets on domains. It is a technique called wavelet probing introduced independently in [59] and <ref> [8, 53] </ref>. Let us discuss the idea first on the real line. Consider a function which is smooth except for jump discontinuities at isolated points. We know that the decay of the wavelet coefficients is fast away from the jumps, and slow in the neighborhood of the jumps.

In <ref> [16] </ref> lifting is used to build reversible wavelets which map integers to integers for applications to lossless image coding. The idea is to introduce a non-linear round-off in each lifting step. This way the result is guaranteed to be integer while the lifting assure that the transform is invertible.

Reference-contexts: Note. As mentioned in the introduction, we learned after finishing this work that Wolfgang Dahmen and collaborators independently obtained a construction of multi-scale bases with a technique very similar to lifting <ref> [17] </ref>. We here go into more detail comparing the two approaches. <p> In the setting of <ref> [17] </ref> a more general operator of the form 0 K is used (which for K = I becomes lifting). This operator is invertible if and only if K is invertible. <p> This operator is invertible if and only if K is invertible. The inverse is then given by 0 K 1 : This setting is more general and allows to explore all degrees of freedom one has to generate new biorthogonal filters. In Section 3.3 of <ref> [17] </ref> a K 6= I is construced LIFTING AND SECOND GENERATION WAVELETS 31 which generates orthogonal decompositions. Section 4.1 of [17] discusses the case of compactly supported semi-orthogonal spline wavelets on irregular knot sequences. However, these settings do not allow both K and K 1 to be sparse. <p> In Section 3.3 of <ref> [17] </ref> a K 6= I is construced LIFTING AND SECOND GENERATION WAVELETS 31 which generates orthogonal decompositions.

Reference-contexts: Higher-dimensional wavelets can always be constructed using tensor products, but this leads to severe axial directional dependencies.

Here too lifting can help. Each lattice allows for the immediate definition of a Lazy wavelet or a Haar wavelet, either 2-band or M -band. Polynomial cancelation then leads to the filter coefficients.

Reference-contexts: In [44] it is shown that one can use wavelets to build multilevel preconditioners which result in stiffness matrices with uniformly bounded condition numbers. This leads to linear solution algorithms. To solve real life problems one needs wavelets constructed on non-smooth (Lipschitz) domains in R n . In <ref> [27, 74] </ref> such a construction is presented. In both cases, tensor product wavelets are used in the interior of the domain while at the boundary specially adapted wavelets are constructed. In this sense these constructions are the natural generalization of the interval constructions to higher dimensions.

Reference-contexts: It is important to note that even though recursive wavelets only use a finite number of levels, the stability issue does not go away but rather manifests itself as a problem concerning ill-conditioning. 14.6.

The idea is to also further split the W j spaces with the help of the h and g filters. This way one obtains a better frequency localization. The splitting leads to a full binary tree of wavelet packets, which form a redundant set.

Reference-contexts: For a given function, one can choose the best-basis with respect to a criterion such as the entropy of the basis coefficients. A fast tree algorithm to find the best basis was introduced in <ref> [36] </ref>, see also [115]. This idea again carries over into the second generation setting and can be combined with lifting. The conditions for exact reconstruction have exactly the same algebraic structure as in the wavelet case.

Reference-contexts: Already in the simple case of the Laplace equation and a non-smooth domain it was recently shown that one cannot obtain an O (M 2 ) accuracy (where M is the number of elements) unless one uses non-linear approximation <ref> [39] </ref>. The underlying reason is that the solution does not belong to the second order Sobolev space but rather to a second order Besov space. In other words, one has to use adaptive grids to obtain the correct convergence order. There is another important application of wavelets on domains.

In <ref> [44] </ref> it is shown that one can use wavelets to build multilevel preconditioners which result in stiffness matrices with uniformly bounded condition numbers.

Reference-contexts: This does not cascade out. Lifting thus opens the door to smooth adaptive wavelets. Current research involves the incorporation of these wavelets in illumination computations. A word of caution is needed here. In <ref> [46, 96] </ref> it is shown that adaptive wavelet algorithms require wavelets on manifolds satisfying specific conditions concerning stability, regularity, and norm equivalence. As pointed out earlier, lifting does not guarantee these conditions and they have to be verified in each particular case. 14.5. Recursive wavelets.

Reference-contexts: Moreover K 1 might be difficult to compute numerically. Many of the attractive features of lifting such as in-place computation, no need for inverting operators, and adaptive transforms using "aunt" functions disappear when allowing a general K 6= I. In the first generation setting it was shown recently <ref> [52] </ref> that in case of finite filters no generality is lost when restricting oneself to the lifting setting: all finite filters can be obtained using multiple alternate primal and dual lifting steps.

Reference-contexts: Once a Lazy wavelet is defined, dual lifting provides interpolating scaling functions, and lifting yields wavelets with vanishing moments. The dual lifting can be seen as an instance of irregular Deslauriers-Dubuc subdivision <ref> [54, 55] </ref>. Current research involves the study of more advanced choices for the Lazy wavelet.

Reference-contexts: As pointed out earlier, lifting does not guarantee these conditions and they have to be verified in each particular case. 14.5. Recursive wavelets. The principle of recursive wavelets is explained in <ref> [8, 56] </ref>. The basic idea is not to use the cascade algorithm ad infinitum to construct the scaling functions, but instead fix the scaling functions on an arbitrary finest level n. This can be generalized easily to the second generation case.

Reference-contexts: In other words, one has to use adaptive grids to obtain the correct convergence order. There is another important application of wavelets on domains. It is a technique called wavelet probing introduced independently in <ref> [59] </ref> and [8, 53]. Let us discuss the idea first on the real line. Consider a function which is smooth except for jump discontinuities at isolated points. We know that the decay of the wavelet coefficients is fast away from the jumps, and slow in the neighborhood of the jumps.

Reference-contexts: Lifting then only requires pulling in the right aunts (scaling functions on the coarser level) at the boundary of the interval. All calculations can be done in-place. For details we refer to [106]. A software package, LIFTPACK, to calculate the wavelet transformation of images is currently available <ref> [64] </ref>. Its properties are: in-place calculation, correct treatment of boundaries, arbitrary size images (not only powers of two), and a faster implementation of existing biorthogonal wavelet filters (speedup can be a factor of two). 14.2.

Reference-contexts: This restriction, however, is not fundamental. Recursive wavelets allow for atomic measures. Indeed, there is no reason why any of the subsets of S n;k should be measurable. As is shown in <ref> [68] </ref>, it is possible to build Haar wavelets on fully discrete sets such as the integers, or on sets which are of mixed continuous/discrete nature. Also the lifting scheme remains valid. The idea of recursive wavelets can also be combined with the idea of adaptive wavelets of the previous section.

Reference-contexts: In [44] it is shown that one can use wavelets to build multilevel preconditioners which result in stiffness matrices with uniformly bounded condition numbers. This leads to linear solution algorithms. To solve real life problems one needs wavelets constructed on non-smooth (Lipschitz) domains in R n . In <ref> [27, 74] </ref> such a construction is presented. In both cases, tensor product wavelets are used in the interior of the domain while at the boundary specially adapted wavelets are constructed. In this sense these constructions are the natural generalization of the interval constructions to higher dimensions.

If the operator is of the form DaD, then operator wavelets defined as the anti-derivative of weighted wavelets with weight function w (x) = p a (x) diagonalize the operator. The solution algorithm is thus simply a forward and inverse wavelet transform.

Reference-contexts: Higher-dimensional wavelets can always be constructed using tensor products, but this leads to severe axial directional dependencies. Instead one prefers to work with non separable wavelets which have more axial symmetry and which do not necessarily use a product lattice, see for example <ref> [22, 28, 32, 76, 77, 89, 90, 92, 93] </ref>. Here too lifting can help. Each lattice allows for the immediate definition of a Lazy wavelet or a Haar wavelet, either 2-band or M -band. Polynomial cancelation then leads to the filter coefficients.

Reference-contexts: This does not cascade out. Lifting thus opens the door to smooth adaptive wavelets. Current research involves the incorporation of these wavelets in illumination computations. A word of caution is needed here. In <ref> [46, 96] </ref> it is shown that adaptive wavelet algorithms require wavelets on manifolds satisfying specific conditions concerning stability, regularity, and norm equivalence. As pointed out earlier, lifting does not guarantee these conditions and they have to be verified in each particular case. 14.5. Recursive wavelets.

Reference-contexts: Lifting will take care of the rest. The resulting wavelets are defined intrinsically on the manifold and do not depend on any parameterization or atlas. In <ref> [99] </ref> the lifting scheme is used to construct wavelets on a sphere. Partition-ings of the sphere were obtained by starting from a Platonic solid and alternating triangular subdivision and projection out to the sphere. This is known as a geodesic sphere construction. <p> This process cascades out and would imply subdividing the whole level j and thus makes adaptive constructions awkward. LIFTING AND SECOND GENERATION WAVELETS 27 Tree wavelets are discontinuous and this is a drawback in many applications. As shown in <ref> [99] </ref>, lifting provides a solution here. Indeed, because of the "aunt" property, subdividing a set S on level j only requires its neighbors to exist, but not necessarily requires them to be subdivided as well. <p> Acknowledgement.

The feedback from the numerous and stimulating discussions with Peter was a tremendous help in writing this paper and has led to several new insights.

If the operator is of the form DaD, then operator wavelets defined as the anti-derivative of weighted wavelets with weight function w (x) = p a (x) diagonalize the operator. The solution algorithm is thus simply a forward and inverse wavelet transform.

Reference-contexts: This way we can construct non compactly supported wavelets with only finite filters. 14.8. Non separable wavelets in R n . As mentioned earlier, the lifting scheme also leads to new insights in the construction of first generation wavelets. This was shown in the one-dimensional case in <ref> [105] </ref>. Higher-dimensional wavelets can always be constructed using tensor products, but this leads to severe axial directional dependencies.

Reference-contexts: The Haar and Lazy wavelet can be trivially defined on the interval. Lifting then only requires pulling in the right aunts (scaling functions on the coarser level) at the boundary of the interval. All calculations can be done in-place. For details we refer to <ref> [106] </ref>. A software package, LIFTPACK, to calculate the wavelet transformation of images is currently available [64]. Its properties are: in-place calculation, correct treatment of boundaries, arbitrary size images (not only powers of two), and a faster implementation of existing biorthogonal wavelet filters (speedup can be a factor of two). 14.2. <p> If we can now choose a weight function w so that w f is a smooth function, then the approximation with weighted wavelets will be again of the order of the number of vanishing moments. An example of this behavior is given in <ref> [106] </ref>. 26 WIM SWELDENS Weighted wavelets are also useful in the solution of boundary value ODEs, see [75, 104]. If the operator is of the form DaD, then operator wavelets defined as the anti-derivative of weighted wavelets with weight function w (x) = p a (x) diagonalize the operator. <p> Coarser levels are needed in the wavelet transform, finer in the cascade algorithm. A simple strategy, which was used in <ref> [106] </ref> is to retain every other sample on the coarser level and put a new sample in the middle of two old samples on the finer levels. Once a Lazy wavelet is defined, dual lifting provides interpolating scaling functions, and lifting yields wavelets with vanishing moments. <p> Acknowledgement. While this paper was being written (spring 1995), the author worked in close collaboration with Peter Schroder on the application of the lifting scheme to the construction of spherical wavelets [99, 100] and on a tutorial paper <ref> [106] </ref>. The feedback from the numerous and stimulating discussions with Peter was a tremendous help in writing this paper and has led to several new insights. Peter also helped improving the exposition in this paper considerably.

Reference-contexts: For each subspace a different filter is used. Several constructions were introduced in <ref> [72, 81, 102, 109] </ref>. In some sense the second generation wavelet setting already incorporates this. Indeed, it even allows for different filters for each individual wavelet. However, thinking of lifting combined with M -band wavelets can lead to new constructions. Let us start with the Lazy wavelet. <p> Indeed, it even allows for different filters for each individual wavelet. However, thinking of lifting combined with M -band wavelets can lead to new constructions. Let us start with the Lazy wavelet. An M -band Lazy wavelet is easily defined and again is the standard polyphase transform <ref> [109] </ref>. Now one can define a new wavelet as an old wavelet plus a linear combination of scaling functions on the coarser level. This would be ordinary lifting.

Reference-contexts: It is important to note that even though recursive wavelets only use a finite number of levels, the stability issue does not go away but rather manifests itself as a problem concerning ill-conditioning. 14.6. Wavelet packets. Wavelet packets were introduced by Coifman, Meyer, and Wickerhauser <ref> [34, 35, 114, 115] </ref>. The idea is to also further split the W j spaces with the help of the h and g filters. This way one obtains a better frequency localization. The splitting leads to a full binary tree of wavelet packets, which form a redundant set.

A fast tree algorithm to find the best basis was introduced in [36], see also <ref> [115] </ref>. This idea again carries over into the second generation setting and can be combined with lifting. The conditions for exact reconstruction have exactly the same algebraic structure as in the wavelet case.
