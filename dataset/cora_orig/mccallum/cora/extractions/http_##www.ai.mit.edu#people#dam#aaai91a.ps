Title: Observations on Cognitive Judgments  
Author: David McAllester 
Abstract: It is obvious to anyone familiar with the rules of the game of chess that a king on an empty board can reach every square. It is true, but not obvious, that a knight can reach every square. Why is the first fact obvious but the second fact not? This paper presents an analytic theory of a class of obviousness judgments of this type. Whether or not the specifics of this analysis are correct, it seems that the study of obviousness judgments can be used to construct integrated theories of This report describes research done at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Consider the following examples, some of which are given above.

Reference-contexts: The language contains a Kleene star operation to express an indeterminate number of iterations of an operation. The induction rule is similar to the induction rule of propositional dynamic logic [ Pratt, 1976 ] , <ref> [ Harel, 1984 ] </ref> , [ Kozen and Tiuryn, 1990 ] . The language described here is also closely related to the knowledge representation language described in [ McAllester et al., 1989 ] . The classical syntax for first order logic involves two grammatical categories | formulas and terms.

Reference-contexts: The remainder of this paper can be divided into two parts. The first discusses local rule sets and their role in theories of cognitive judgments. The general concept of a local rule set was introduced in <ref> [ McAllester, 1990 ] </ref> . The second part of the paper discusses a class of "inductive" cognitive judgments. An inductive cognitive judgement consists of an obvious sequent where a formal (syntactic) derivation of the sequent appears to require reasoning by mathematical induction. <p> Let R be a set of inference rules. The following definitions and lemma are from <ref> [ McAllester, 1990 ] </ref> . <p> An immediate consequence of the above definitions and lemma is that local rule sets are tractable, i.e., they generate polynomial time decidable inference relations. A variety of nontrivial local rule sets is presented in <ref> [ McAllester, 1990 ] </ref> .
