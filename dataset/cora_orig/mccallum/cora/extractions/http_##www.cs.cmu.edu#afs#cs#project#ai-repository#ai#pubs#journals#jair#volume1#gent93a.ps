Abstract: We describe an extensive study of search in GSAT, an approximation procedure for propositional satisfiability. GSAT performs greedy hill-climbing on the number of satisfied clauses in a truth assignment. Our experiments provide a more complete picture of GSAT's search than previous accounts. We describe in detail the two phases of search: rapid hill-climbing followed by a long plateau search. We demonstrate that when applied to randomly generated 3-SAT problems, there is a very simple scaling with problem size for both the mean number of satisfied clauses and the mean branching rate. Our results allow us to make detailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hill-climbing phase, the average gradient of this phase, and to conjecture that both the average score and average branching rate decay exponentially during plateau search. We end by showing how these results can be used to direct future theoretical analysis. This work provides a case study of how computer experiments can be used to improve understanding of the theoretical properties of algorithms.

Reference-contexts: At lower L, most problems generated are under-constrained and are thus satisfiable; at higher L, most problems generated are over-constrained and are thus unsatisfiable. As with many NP-complete problems, problems in the phase transition are typically much more difficult to solve than problems away from the transition <ref> (Cheeseman, Kanefsky, & Taylor, 1991) </ref>. The region L=4.3N is thus generally considered to be a good source of hard SAT problems and has been the focus of much recent experimental effort. 4.

Reference-contexts: We believe that the results we give here will actually apply to a larger family of procedures for satisfiability called GenSAT <ref> (Gent & Walsh, 1993) </ref>. Understanding such procedures more fully is of considerable practical interest since SAT is, in many ways, the archetypical (and intractable) NP-hard problem. In addition, many AI problems can be encoded quite naturally in SAT (eg. constraint satisfaction, diagnosis and vision interpretation, refutational theorem proving, planning). <p> := 1 to Max-flips if T satisfies then return T else Poss-flips := set of vars which increase satisfiability most V := a random element of Poss-flips T := T with V's truth assignment flipped end return "no satisfying assignment found" 48 An Empirical Analysis of Search in GSAT In <ref> (Gent & Walsh, 1993) </ref> we describe a large number of experiments which suggest that neither greediness not randomness is important for the performance of this procedure. These experiments also suggest various other conjectures. <p> Although almost all such problems are unsatisfiable, we observed exactly the same scaling behaviour. The score 3. At 100 variables, 2.5N flips is close to the optimal value for Max-flips. However, experiments have suggested that Max-flips may need to vary quadratically for larger N <ref> (Gent & Walsh, 1993) </ref>. 52 An Empirical Analysis of Search in GSAT (a) Mean score (b) Mean change in score, poss-flips (a) mean score, L = 4.3N (b) mean poss-flips, L = 4.3N does not reach such a high value as in Figure 4a, as is to be expected, but nevertheless <p> Another "greedy algorithm for satisfiability" has been analysed in (Koutsoupias & Papadimitriou, 1992), but our results are not directly applicable to it because, unlike GSAT, it disallows sideways flips. In <ref> (Gent & Walsh, 1993) </ref> we describe an empirical study of GenSAT, a family of procedures related to GSAT. This study focuses on the importance of randomness, greediness and hill-climbing for the effectiveness of these procedures. In addition, we determine how performance depends on parameters like Max-tries and Max-flips.

Reference-contexts: Related Work Prior to the introduction of GSAT in (Selman et al., 1992), a closely related set of procedures were studied by Gu <ref> (Gu, 1992) </ref>. These procedures have a different control structure to GSAT which allows them, for instance, to make sideways moves when upwards moves are possible. This makes it difficult to compare our results directly.

Reference-contexts: However, such theoretical analysis is often too complex for our current mathematical tools. Where theoretical analysis is practical, it is often limited to (unrealistically) simple cases. For example, results presented in <ref> (Koutsoupias & Papadimitriou, 1992) </ref> for the greedy algorithm for satisfiability do not apply to interesting and hard region of problems as described in x3. In addition, actual behaviour on real problems is sometimes quite different to worst and average case analyses. <p> This makes it difficult to compare our results directly. Nevertheless, we are confident that the approach taken here would apply equally well to these procedures, and that similar results could be expected. Another "greedy algorithm for satisfiability" has been analysed in <ref> (Koutsoupias & Papadimitriou, 1992) </ref>, but our results are not directly applicable to it because, unlike GSAT, it disallows sideways flips. In (Gent & Walsh, 1993) we describe an empirical study of GenSAT, a family of procedures related to GSAT.

Reference-contexts: In addition, actual behaviour on real problems is sometimes quite different to worst and average case analyses. We therefore support the calls of McGeoch <ref> (McGeoch, 1986) </ref>, Hooker (Hooker, 1993) and others for the development of an empirical science of algorithms. In such a science, experiments as well as theory are used to advance our understanding of the properties of algorithms. <p> Informal observations to this effect were made by Bart Selman during the presentation of (Selman et al., 1992) at AAAI-92.

That is, we looked for features of performance which are meaningful and which are as predictable as possible.
