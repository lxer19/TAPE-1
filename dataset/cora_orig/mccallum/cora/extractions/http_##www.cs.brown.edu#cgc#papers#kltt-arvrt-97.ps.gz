Title: Area Requirement of Visibility Representations of Trees  
Author: Goos Kant Giuseppe Liotta Roberto Tamassia Ioannis G. Tollis 
Abstract: We study the area requirement of bar-visibility and rectangle-visibility representations of trees in the plane. We prove asymptotically tight lower and upper bounds on the area of such representations, and give linear-time algorithms that construct representations with asymptotically optimal area.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Visibility is a fundamental relation in computational geometry (see, e.g., <ref> [1, 8, 9] </ref>). In particular, the problem of constructing visibility representations of graphs, where the vertices are drawn as geometric objects of a certain class and the edges are associated with pairs of "visible" objects, has been extensively investigated (see, e.g., [3, 5, 12]).

Reference-contexts: If instead the bars are required to be closed segments (i.e., to include their endpoints), then it is NP-complete to determine whether a graph admits a bar-visibility representation <ref> [2] </ref>. If G is a directed graph, an upward bar-visibility representation of G is a bar-visibility representation such that for every edge (v 0 ; v 00 ), the bar of v 00 is vertically above the bar of v 0 .
