Abstract: On Some Tighter Inapproximability Results, Abstract Improved inaproximability results are given, including the best up to date explicit approximation thresholds for bounded occurence sat-isfiability problems, like MAX-2SAT and E2-LIN-2, and problems in bounded degree graphs, like MIS, Node Cover and MAX CUT. We prove also for the first time inapproximability of the problem of Sorting by Reversals and display an explicit approximation threshold for this problem. fl A preliminary version of this paper appeared in ECCC TR98-029 (1998). z Dept. of Computer Science, University of Bonn, 53117 Bonn.

Reference-contexts: The method uses randomized reductions and applies to the number of problems including Maximum Independent Set in graphs of degree d (d-MIS), bounded degree Minimum Node Cover (d-Node Cover), bounded degree MAX CUT (d-MAX CUT) and bounded occurrence MAX-2SAT (d-OCC-MAX-2SAT), (cf. [PY91], [A94], [BS92], [BF94], [BF95], <ref> [AFWZ95] </ref>). This yields also the first explicit approximation lower bounds for the small degree graph problems, and the small dependency satisfiability.

Reference-contexts: The last reduction, , converts a breakpoint graph G into a permutation (G), an instance of sorting by reversals, MIN-SBR. We use a standard reduction, i.e. the correspondence between permutations and breakpoints graphs used in the approximation algorithms for MIN-SBR (this approach was initiated by Bafna and Pevzner, <ref> [BP96] </ref>). In general, this correspondence is not approximation preserving because of so-called hurdles (see [BP96, HP95]). <p> We use a standard reduction, i.e. the correspondence between permutations and breakpoints graphs used in the approximation algorithms for MIN-SBR (this approach was initiated by Bafna and Pevzner, [BP96]). In general, this correspondence is not approximation preserving because of so-called hurdles (see <ref> [BP96, HP95] </ref>). <p> The basic reason is that all ACs of length 4 that may belong to a normalized solution (decomposition into ACs) for a single connected component in the interleaving graph (cf. <ref> [BP96, HP95] </ref>), because the number of longer cycles in a cover is O (n=log n), this implies that the total number of connected components of the interleaving graph is O (n=log n).

Reference-contexts: Independently, we apply this method to prove for the first time approximation hardness of the problem of sorting by reversals, MIN-SBR, motivated by molecular biology [HP95], and proven only recently to be NP-hard [C97].

The core of the new method is the use of restricted versions of the E2-LIN-2 and E3-LIN-2 problems studied in [H97]. <p> This translation replaces each node/variable with a small gadget. The resulting instances of 4-MIS can be transformed into the next problem that we consider, which we call breakpoint graph decomposition, BGD. This problem is related to maximum alternating cycle decomposition, (e.g. see Caprara, <ref> [C97] </ref>) but has a different objective function (as with another pair of related problems, Node Cover and MIS, the choice of the objective function affects approximability). <p> instance of 3-OCC-MAX 2SAT with 2016n clauses has a truth assignment that satisfies at least (2012 *)n clauses, or it can be at most (2011 + *)n. 18 8 Reduction to MIN-SBR Our reduction from BGD to MIN-SBR is straightforward, in particular we can use the procedure GET-PERMUTATION of Caprara <ref> [C97, p.77] </ref> to obtain permutation (G) from a given breakpoint graph G. It is easy to show that if G is the result of reduction o 4 ffi o 1 applied to E2-LIN-2, then has o (n) hurdles.
