Abstract: In some applications of electronic watermarks, the device that detects whether content contains a watermark or not is in public domain. Attackers can misuse such detector as an oracle that reveals up to one bit of information about the watermark in each experiment. An information-theoretical analysis of the information leakage is provided, and a method is proposed to reduce the information leakage by orders of magnitude. keywords: Cryptanalysis, Copy Protection, Electronic Watermarks

Reference-contexts: An important class of proposed detectors is covered in Section 2. An attacker can nonetheless learn and erase the watermark by experimenting with the content that he inputs to the detector <ref> [1] </ref>. Unless special precautions are taken, the attacker gains one bit of information about the watermark in every attempt. This implies that the attack is linear with the number of pixels in the image. <p> This detector can either be in a tamperproof box, or it can be a remote server algorithm on a network that allows users to submit random images for watermarks detection. In abstract terms, the attacker operates as follows <ref> [1] </ref>: [Select random point in S &lt; , near S = ] He initially searches for a random point q 0 2 S &lt; as close as practically possible to S = . At this point it does not matter whether the resulting image resembles the original or not. <p> The use of watermarks in copy control for consumer electronic products, however, is not yet fully understood. We have investigated the sensitivity attack. The proposed countermeasure increases the workload by orders of magnitude, but the workload remains linear in the number of pixels. In <ref> [1] </ref> a sensitivity attack is described that shows that if a watermark detection algorithm could be placed in a perfectly tamperproof box, this does not necessarily imply that the attacker cannot find a method to remove the watermark.

Reference-contexts: Particularly because of ongoing developments in perceptual modelling, such solutions tend to differ from implementation to implementation and to improve over time <ref> [7] </ref>. The reader may assume that the embedding method creates a new image q with q = r + fl w, where is an appropriate embedding depth and fl is a pixelwise multiplication.

Reference-contexts: We notice that h 0 (x) = log ((1x)=x) and that the second derivative h (2) (x) = 1=(x (1x) ln 2). For a thorough treatment in information theory we refer to Cover and Thomas <ref> [8] </ref>. To defend the confidentiality of the watermark, the system designer of the copy protection scheme keeps the information that D i reveals about the watermark as small as possible. He designs function p such that I (D i ; w (n)) is small enough.
