Title: On The State of Evolutionary Computation

Affiliation: George Mason University  Naval Research Laboratory  
Abstract: In the past few years the evolutionary computation landscape has been rapidly changing as a result of increased levels of interaction between various research groups and the injection of new ideas which challenge old tenets. The effect has been simultaneously exciting, invigorating, annoying, and bewildering to the old-timers as well as the new-comers to the field. Emerging out of all of this activity are the beginnings of some structure, some common themes, and some agreement on important open issues. We attempt to summarize these emergent properties in this paper.

Reference-contexts: Historically, the EP and ES communities have emphasized the former while the GA community has emphasized the latter. However, these traditional views are breaking down rapidly. The ES community has found recombination to to be useful, particularly in evolving adaptive mutation rates <ref> (Ba .. ck et al, 1991) </ref>. Various members of the GA community have reported improved results by not using recombination (de Garis, 1990), by not using mutation (Koza, 1992), or by adding new and more powerful mutation operators (Eshelman and Schaffer, 1991). <p> One of the important issues not well understood is the bene fit of adaptive reproductive operators. There are now a variety of empirical studies which show the effectiveness of adaptive mutation rates (e.g., (Fogarty, 1989), <ref> (Ba .. ck et al, 1991) </ref>, or (Fogel and Atmar, 1992)) as well as adaptive recombination mechanisms (e.g., (Schaffer and Morishima, 1987), (Davis, 1989), or (Spears, 1992b)). 4 NEW AND POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT DIMENSIONS FOR EC RESEARCH In the previous section, we summarized the current state of the art with respect to

Reference-contexts: Some solutions to these problems have been suggested, such as crowding (De Jong, 1975), sharing (Goldberg, 1987), and tagging <ref> (Booker, 1982) </ref>. Unfortunately, these solutions tend to make fairly strong assumptions, such as the number of species and/or the distribution of niches in the environment. For some problems these assumptions are reasonable.

Reference-contexts: Beginning with Holland's initial work (1975), the GA community has analyzed in considerable detail the role of crossover and mutation (see, for example, (Goldberg, 1989b), (Vose and Liepins, 1991), <ref> (Booker, 1992) </ref>, (De Jong and Spears, 1992), or (Spears, 1992a)). The ES community has developed theoretical models for optimal mutation rates with respect to convergence and convergence rates in the context of function optimization (Schwefel, 1981).

Reference-contexts: As we move to more complex systems which attempt to evolve cooperating behavior and which may have more than one evolutionary process active simultaneously, the roles of non-random mating and speciation will become an important issue. Some solutions to these problems have been suggested, such as crowding <ref> (De Jong, 1975) </ref>, sharing (Goldberg, 1987), and tagging (Booker, 1982). Unfortunately, these solutions tend to make fairly strong assumptions, such as the number of species and/or the distribution of niches in the environment.

Reference-contexts: Universality was also a central theme of the early work on EP. The direction this took was the idea of representing individuals phenotypically as finite state machines capable of responding to environmental stimuli, and developing operators (primarily mutation) for effecting structural and behavioral change over time <ref> (Fogel et al, 1966) </ref>. These ideas were then applied to a broad range of problems including prediction problems, optimization, and machine learning. These early characterizations, however, are no longer all that useful in describing the enormous variety of current activities on the field.

Reference-contexts: Although we understand that the size of an EA's population can affect its ability to solve problems, we have only the beginnings of a theory strong enough to provide a priori guidance in choosing an appropriate fixed size (e.g., <ref> (Goldberg, 1989a) </ref>), not much theory regarding appropriate levels of elasticity (K), and even less understanding as to the merits of dynamically adjusting the population size. 3.3.2 Deletion Strategies The processes used to delete individuals varies significantly from one EA to another and includes strategies such as uniform random deletion, deletion of

Reference-contexts: GA practitioners are seldom constrained to universal fixed-length binary implementations. ES practitioners have incorporated recombination operators into their systems. EP is used for more than just the evolution of finite state machines. Provocative new terms and ideas like "messy GAs" <ref> (Goldberg, 1991) </ref> and "genetic programming" (de Garis, 1990; Koza, 1992) have emerged on the landscape. This suggests that we need to rethink how we think about evolutionary computation. Categorizing things according to historical roots appears to have outgrown its usefulness. <p> If we use an EA, how do we use fitness as a performance feedback for self-adaptation ? On a positive note, the EC community has already empirically illustrated the viability of self-adaptation of mutation and recombination as noted earlier, as well as adaptive representations like Argot (Shaefer, 1987), messy GAs <ref> (Goldberg, 1991) </ref>, the dynamic parameter encoding (DPE) scheme of Schraudolph and Belew (1992), and the Delta coding of Whitley et al (1991). 4.6 CO-EVOLUTIONARY SYSTEMS Hillis' recent work (1990) on the improvements achievable by co-evolving parasites along with the actual individuals of interest gives an exciting glimpse of the behavioral complexity

Reference-contexts: Clearly, the parent selection and individual deletion strategies must complement each other in terms of the overall effect they have on the exploration/exploitation balance. We have some theory here for particular cases such as Holland's "optimal allocation of trials" characterization of traditional GAs <ref> (Holland, 1975) </ref>, and the "1/5" rule for ESs (Schwefel, 1981), but much stronger results are needed. 3.3.4 The Mechanisms of Reproduction In addition to these selection processes, the mechanisms used for reproduction also affect the balance between exploration and exploitation.

However, as we attempt to evolve increasingly more complex structures (e.g., Lisp code <ref> (Koza, 1992) </ref> or neural networks (de Garis, 1990)), it becomes increasingly difficult to define forms of mutation and recombination which are capable of producing structurally sound and interesting new individuals.
