Title: Combining Data Mining and Machine Learning for Effective User Profiling

Abstract: This paper describes the automatic design of methods for detecting fraudulent behavior. Much of the design is accomplished using a series of machine learning methods. In particular, we combine data mining and constructive induction with more standard machine learning techniques to design methods for detecting fraudulent usage of cellular telephones based on profiling customer behavior. Specifically, we use a rule- learning program to uncover indicators of fraudulent behavior from a large database of cellular calls. These indicators are used to create profilers, which then serve as features to a system that combines evidence from multiple profilers to generate high-confidence alarms. Experiments indicate that this automatic approach performs nearly as well as the best hand-tuned methods for detecting fraud.

Reference-contexts: Stan- dard methods of fraud detection include analyzing call data for overlapping calls (collisions), or calls in temporal proximity that could not have been placed by the same user due to geographic dispersion (velocity checks) <ref> (Davis & Goyal 1993) </ref>. More sophisticated methods involve profiling user behavior and looking for significant deviations from normal patterns. This paper addresses the automatic design of such methods. One approach to detecting fraud automatically is to learn a classifier for individual calls.

Reference-contexts: A feature selection process is used to reduce the number of profilers in the final detector. Some of the rules do not perform well when used in profilers, and some profilers overlap in their fraud detection coverage. We therefore employ a sequential forward selection process <ref> (Kittler 1986) </ref> which chooses a small set of useful profilers. Empirically, this simplifies the final detector and increases its accuracy.

Reference-contexts: RL searches for rules with certainty factors above a user-defined threshold. The certainty factor we used for these runs was a simple frequency-based probability estimate, corrected for small samples <ref> (Quinlan 1987) </ref>. The call data are organized by account, and each call record is labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. When RL is applied to an account's calls it produces a set of rules that serve to distinguish, within that account, the fraudulent calls from the legitimate calls.

Reference-contexts: Methods that deal with time series are relevant to our work. However, time series analysis (Chatfield 1984; Farnum & Stanton 1989) strives to characterize an entire time series or to forecast future events in the series. Neither ability is directly useful to fraud detection. Hidden Markov Models <ref> (Rabiner & Juang 1986) </ref> are concerned with distinguishing recurring sequences of states and the transitions between them. However, fraud detection usually only deals with two states (the "frauded" and "un-frauded" states) with a single transition between them.

Reference-contexts: Introduction In the United States, cellular fraud costs the telecommunications industry hundreds of millions of dollars per year <ref> (Walters & Wilkinson 1994) </ref>. A specific kind of cellular fraud called cloning is particularly expensive and epidemic in major cities throughout the United States. Existing methods for detecting cloning fraud are ad hoc and their evaluation is virtually nonexistent.
