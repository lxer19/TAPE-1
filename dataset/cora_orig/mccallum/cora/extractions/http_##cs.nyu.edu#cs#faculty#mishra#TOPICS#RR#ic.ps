Title: Reactive Algorithms for Grasping using a modified parallel jaw gripper  
Author: Marek Teichmann and Bud Mishra 
Abstract: We consider the problem of grasping an unknown polygonal flat object using a parallel jaw gripper. Here we propose to equip a standard gripper with several light-beam sensors (close to each jaw) and describe a reactive grasping algorithm. This is done by probing the object to locate a good grasp position, and then grasping, without moving the object significantly. The goal is to do as little motion as possible to find a grasp. This algorithm can be viewed in a competitive framework, where our algorithm is competing against any algorithm which already knows the object.

Reference-contexts: minor modifications, the algorithms can also be used for determining the shape of (the convex hull of) a planar part, again without disturbing the part. 2 Related Literature Our work shares some similarities with Goldberg's gripper [G90] and is motivated by the same paradigm as Canny and Goldberg's RISC robotics <ref> [CG93] </ref>. In [G90], Ken Goldberg has modified the basic gripper to reduce the friction between the gripper and the object being grasped. This friction occurs when the gripper is being closed on an object, and this object is forced to rotate.

Reference-contexts: This permits the determination of the object, but also subjects it to many motions. Another method involves grasping in random orientations to distinguish planar parts. In the Computational Geometry literature, there are several results on probing. Probing using finger probes <ref> [CY] </ref>, and line and other probes [DEY] is considered. We are mainly interested in line probes: a line is swept (either in parallel or rotating) until the object is hit. The probe returns the position of the line where it hit the object first.

Reference-contexts: much more sensory information than what is assumed theoretically necessary, and (2) simple parallel jaw grippers, where grasping algorithms can be made immune to lack of any sensory information (for instance, by removing friction in the transversal direction between a jaw of the gripper and the grasped object; see Goldberg <ref> [G90] </ref>). <p> With minor modifications, the algorithms can also be used for determining the shape of (the convex hull of) a planar part, again without disturbing the part. 2 Related Literature Our work shares some similarities with Goldberg's gripper <ref> [G90] </ref> and is motivated by the same paradigm as Canny and Goldberg's RISC robotics [CG93].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the past, the usual approach to grasping has been to assume an accurate model of the object to be grasped and from such a model, an o*ine geometric algorithm determines a set of grip points, where the fingers are then placed. (See Mishra, Schwartz and Sharir <ref> [MSS87] </ref>). Once the grip points have been determined, the geometry of the object is deemed irrelevant and the grasp is determined and maintained by only controlling the magnitudes of the forces at the grip points.

Reference-contexts: Several results exist on finding grasps for such a parallel jaw gripper, when the object is known [RG92a, RG92b]. Recent results consider closing the gripper on an unknown object, and measuring the jaw distance for various orientations <ref> [R93] </ref>. This permits the determination of the object, but also subjects it to many motions. Another method involves grasping in random orientations to distinguish planar parts. In the Computational Geometry literature, there are several results on probing. Probing using finger probes [CY], and line and other probes [DEY] is considered.
