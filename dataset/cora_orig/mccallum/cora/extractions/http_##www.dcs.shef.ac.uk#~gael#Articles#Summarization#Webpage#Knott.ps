Reference-contexts: For one thing, referring to intentions permits a more fundamental analysis of text: speech act theory (Austin <ref> [1] </ref>, Searle [25]) makes clear the descriptive inadequacies of purely truth-functional analyses. For another thing, the relations allow a uniform compositional account of text.

Reference-contexts: These are perhaps the most obvious means of signalling relations in text, and many other researchers make reference to them under one name or another (Cohen <ref> [2] </ref>: `clue words'; Grosz and Sidner [5]: `cue phrases'; Schiffrin [23]: `discourse markers'). <p> Some definitions of the category of cue phrases exist already, but these are often expressed in theory-laden terms, the only independent characterisation being lists of examples: this is the case, for instance in Grosz and Sidner [5], and in Cohen <ref> [2] </ref>. Cohen's list of examples is more extensive than Grosz and Sidner's, but neither study claims to have a complete list.

Reference-contexts: The class of relations marked by these latter phrases (see figure 6) seems to correspond to Sanders et al's `negative polarity' relations. (However, note that but also marks relations signalling a lack of causality or a lack of similarity; yet as El-hadad and McKeown <ref> [3] </ref> point out, and the taxonomy also shows, but and although are not intersubstitutable.) There is also a certain amount of evidence for Sanders et al's source of coherence parameter (which, it will be recalled, takes a value of `semantic' or `pragmatic').
Reference: [4] <author> J Grimes. </author> <title> The Thread of Discourse. The Hague: </title> <publisher> Mouton, </publisher> <year> 1975. </year>
Reference-contexts: We will refer to theories that make use of ideas of this kind as theories of discourse relations: Grimes' <ref> [4] </ref> rhetorical predicates, Martin's [15] conjunctive relations and Hobbs' [7] coherence relations would all fall into this category. Another fairly common idea in the literature is the notion that at least some kinds of texts have an underlying hierarchical structure.

Reference-contexts: We might call such theories theories of discourse structure. Recent examples of this kind of theory include that of Grosz and Sidner <ref> [5] </ref>, who define textual hierarchy in terms of the dominance and satisfaction-precedence relationships between the underlying intentions of the speaker; and that of Polanyi [17], who proposes related notions of subordination and co-ordination. <p> These are perhaps the most obvious means of signalling relations in text, and many other researchers make reference to them under one name or another (Cohen [2]: `clue words'; Grosz and Sidner <ref> [5] </ref>: `cue phrases'; Schiffrin [23]: `discourse markers'). <p> Some definitions of the category of cue phrases exist already, but these are often expressed in theory-laden terms, the only independent characterisation being lists of examples: this is the case, for instance in Grosz and Sidner <ref> [5] </ref>, and in Cohen [2].

Reference: [6] <author> M Halliday and R Hasan. </author> <title> Cohesion in English. </title> <publisher> Longman, </publisher> <year> 1976. </year>
Reference-contexts: In such cases, it is preferable to leave the anaphoric expression in the phrase. Indeed, as Halliday and Hasan <ref> [6] </ref> point out, many bona fide relational phrases clearly derive from phrases involving anaphora (consider words like therefore and thereby); so this analysis is justified. Another problem in the application of the test is to decide whether the required context for a mini-discourse is linguistic or non-linguistic.

Reference-contexts: We will refer to theories that make use of ideas of this kind as theories of discourse relations: Grimes' [4] rhetorical predicates, Martin's [15] conjunctive relations and Hobbs' <ref> [7] </ref> coherence relations would all fall into this category. Another fairly common idea in the literature is the notion that at least some kinds of texts have an underlying hierarchical structure. <p> The difficult question is deciding which set of relations we use as part of this machinery|if indeed we use relational constructs at all. Hobbs <ref> [7] </ref> was perhaps the first to suggest an explicitly psychological account of relations. He refers to his relations as `text-building strategies', employed by the writer to ease the reader's comprehension process.

Reference-contexts: However, it has recently been adapted for procedural use in a number of natural language generation systems: following early systems by Hovy <ref> [8] </ref> and Moore and Paris [16], many subsequent text planners have incorporated aspects of the theory (for example, Vander Linden et al [28] [27], Rosner and Stede [19] [20]). 3 In the present paper, we take rst as our starting point. <p> Given these features, it is clear why rhetorical relations have proved popular in text generation. Hovy [10] calls them `the basic building elements of coherent text'. The particular role that relations play in text planning varies from system to system: in some (eg Hovy <ref> [8] </ref>), they act as strips-style planning operators which are used to structure a text whose content has already been determined by some prior process; in some (eg Moore and Paris [16]) they are also used to guide content selection; and in some (eg Vander Linden et al [28], Rosner and Stede <p> In Hovy's <ref> [8] </ref> text planner, for instance, relations are used as planning operators, which control how textual elements are incorporated together into a single coherent paragraph. A hierarchy of relations is built up, with clause-sized semantic elements at its leaves.

Reference-contexts: In other cases, relations with the same name are defined differently|for instance, Hovy's sequence has a nucleus and a satellite while the rst sequence is multinuclear; and Rosner and Stede's sequence does not cover sequences of instructions while rst's sequence does. Recently, Hovy <ref> [9] </ref> collected a large set of relations from other researchers, and organised them into a taxonomy: the idea was to produce a `standardised and covering set of relations'. <p> Textual realisation methods can also be used to arrange relations in the hierarchy: in an earlier paper (based on a slightly different taxonomy), Hovy suggests that cue words which can mark a given relation can also be used to mark any of its subordinates (Hovy <ref> [9] </ref>). For instance, then (which marks a sequence relation) can also be used to mark the subordinate temporal-sequence relation). It is clearly expedient for the text planner to use relations which can be associated with methods of textual marking. But there remain some questions about this approach.

Reference-contexts: On the basis of this assumption, it is possible to describe text recursively, using a hierarchical structure of relations. Given these features, it is clear why rhetorical relations have proved popular in text generation. Hovy <ref> [10] </ref> calls them `the basic building elements of coherent text'.

Reference-contexts: Recently, Hovy [9] collected a large set of relations from other researchers, and organised them into a taxonomy: the idea was to produce a `standardised and covering set of relations'. The taxonomy has subsequently been reworked by Maier and Hovy [12] and Hovy et al <ref> [11] </ref>. 5 The surprising feature of these classifications is the number of relations they involve: the latter study uses a systemic network with over 80 relations at the leaves and over 170 relations in the network as a whole. <p> So one way to justify a set of relations is to consider its effectiveness when used as a component of a text planning system like the one just outlined. Hovy's current classification of relations (Hovy et al <ref> [11] </ref>) seems at least partially justified in this way. His relations are arranged into a hierarchy|a top-level distinction between ideational, interpersonal and textual relations is motivated on theoretical (Hallidayan) grounds; but lower down, the practical uses of relations within the planner are given more emphasis.

Reference-contexts: Relation definitions have the status of applications of the theory rather than elements of the theory. One might want to change or replace the definitions: : : such changes are to be expected and do not cross the definitional boundaries of rst. Mann, Matthiessen and Thompson <ref> [13] </ref>, p48. Secondly, the set of relations in rst is `in principle open'. Mann and Thompson claim that a small number of relations is sufficient for analysing the great majority of texts; and that the exceptions involve rare relations seldom seem in normal texts.

Reference-contexts: In the field of computational linguistics, and particularly in the subfield of natural language generation, Mann and Thompson's Rhetorical Structure Theory (rst) <ref> [14] </ref> has been the most influential theory of this kind. <p> For instance, Scott and Souza's list relation [24] is hard to describe in terms of the relations given by Mann and Thompson <ref> [14] </ref>: Scott and Souza use this relation to expand the satellite of a superordinate relation into a number of elements, where Mann and Thompson might be more likely to use multiple satellites for the same nucleus.

Reference-contexts: for instance, it is possible to imagine how words like anyway or because have evolved from more complex formulas and phrases. * There is substantial empirical evidence that cue phrases are used by readers to facilitate the construction of a mental representation of text. (See for example Segal et al <ref> [26] </ref>, for an account of the role of the phrases and, then, so, because and but.) Again, this suggests that a link can be drawn between cue phrases and cognitive representations of text. 13 6 A Data-driven Methodology for Determining a Set of Re- lations In the previous section, it was

Reference-contexts: A variety of sources of evidence suggest that languages are `optimised' in some ways so as best to reflect the communicative needs of their users. For instance, Zipf <ref> [29] </ref> has shown that commonly used words tend to be shorter than uncommon ones: this clearly makes for communicative efficiency, because it minimises the average length of the words we use.
