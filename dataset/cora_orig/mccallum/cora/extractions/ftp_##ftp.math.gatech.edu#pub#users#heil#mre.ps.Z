Title: The Journal of Fourier Analysis and Applications  Matrix Refinement Equations: Existence and Uniqueness  
Author: Christopher Heil and David Colella

Abstract: Matrix refinement equations are functional equations of the form f(x) = P N k=0 c k f(2x k), where the coefficients c k are matrices and f is a vector-valued function. Refinement equations play key roles in wavelet theory and approximation theory. Existence and uniqueness properties of scalar refinement equations (where the coefficients c k are scalars) are known. This paper considers analogous questions for matrix refinement equations. Conditions for existence and uniqueness of compactly supported distributional solutions are given in terms of the convergence properties of an infinite product of the matrix = 1 c k with itself. Fundamental differences between solutions of matrix equations and scalar refinement equations are examined. In particular, it is shown that "constrained" solutions of the matrix refinement equation can exist even when the infinite product diverges. The existence of constrained solutions is related to the eigenvalue structure of ; solutions are obtained from the convergence of on its 1-eigenspace.

Fundamental existence and uniqueness theorems for integrable solutions of scalar refinement equations were proved by Daubechies and Lagarias [DL]. As remarked there, the results extend to compactly supported distributional solutions. We find this latter setting of scaling distributions a convenient framework in which to work.

For example, no compactly supported orthogonal wavelet, other than the Haar wavelet, can be symmetric or antisymmetric [D1]. In addition, the accuracy and smoothness of the scaling function is tied to the number of coefficients in the refinement equation <ref> [DL] </ref>. Thus high accuracy or smoothness implies a large support for the scaling function, for if c 0 , c N 6= 0 then [0; N ] is the smallest connected interval containing supp (f ). <p> The theory of scalar refinement equations is considerably developed.

As remarked there, the results extend to compactly supported distributional solutions. We find this latter setting of scaling distributions a convenient framework in which to work. <p> The fundamental results for scalar refinement equations can be outlined as follows <ref> [DL] </ref>. a. There exists a compactly supported scaling distribution if and only if = 2 n for some integer n 0. In this case, f is supported in the interval [0; N ]. If f is an integrable function, it can have at most N 2 continuous derivatives. 366 C. <p> This completes the proof of Theorem 3.3. In fact, it proves slightly more; when 1 exists and is nontrivial, all distributional solutions whose Fourier transforms are continuous functions must be compactly supported. This can fail if 1 does not exist, even in the scalar case <ref> [DL] </ref>. 6. Constrained Solutions In this section we prove Theorem 3.4. Assume that 1 does not exist but that there is a single eigenvalue such that jj = () &lt; 2 and that this eigenvalue is nondegenerate with multiplicity t.

Reference-contexts: Then f is a tempered distribution whose Fourier transform is a continuous function that satisfies ^ f (2fl) = M (fl) ^ f (fl). Therefore, f is a scaling distribution. To see that f is compactly supported, we modify a technique introduced by Deslauriers and Dubuc <ref> [DD] </ref> for one specific scalar refinement equation.

Moreover, P n (2 n fl) = M (2 n1 fl) M (fl).
