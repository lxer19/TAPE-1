Reference-contexts: Hence, the average response time is (15 + 344) / 2 seconds = 179.5 seconds or an improvement of 60%. It is important to point out that some tape systems, for instance, the D2 tapes used in the Ampex robot system, have the concept of zones <ref> [1] </ref>. These are places on the tape where the tape can drift to and when we stop reading from the tape.

Reference-contexts: This is why in recent years, research in multimedia storage system has received a lot of attention. Most of the research works have investigated in the design of multimedia storage server systems with disk space as the primary storage. In <ref> [2, 13] </ref>, issues such as real-time playback of multiple audio channels have been studied. In [12], the author presented a technique for storing video and audio streams individually on magnetic disk.

Reference-contexts: For example, video movies require high bandwidth and very large storage space. A 100 minutes HDTV video requires at least 2 Mbytes/second display bandwidth and 12 Gbytes of storage <ref> [3] </ref>. A moderate size video library with 1000 videos would then require 12 TBytes storage. To implement and manage such an enormous amount of data all on magnetic disks would not be cost effective.

Reference-contexts: The same author propose in [11]techniques for merging storage patterns of multiple video or audio streams to optimize the disk space utilization and to maximize the number of simultaneous streams. In [5, 6], performance and reliability study was carried out on a robotic storage system. In <ref> [4] </ref>, a novel storage structure known as the staggered stripping technique was proposed as an efficient way for the delivery of multiple video or audio objects with different bandwidth demands to multiple display stations. Finally, a prototype of a continuous media disk storage server was described in [8]. <p> To implement and manage such an enormous amount of data all on magnetic disks would not be cost effective. One approach is to use a robotic tape library as the main storage and a pool of disks, such as disk arrays [10], for buffering and distribution <ref> [4] </ref>. That is, the multimedia objects reside permanently on tapes, and are loaded onto the disks for delivery when requested by the disk server. To reduce the tape access delays, the most actively accessed videos would also be stored in the disks on a longer term basis. <p> In <ref> [4] </ref>, a novel architecture known as the Staggered Striping technique was proposed for high bandwidth objects, such as HTDV video objects. It has been shown that Staggered Striping has a better throughput than the simple striping and virtual data replication techniques for various system loads [4]. <p> In <ref> [4] </ref>, a novel architecture known as the Staggered Striping technique was proposed for high bandwidth objects, such as HTDV video objects. It has been shown that Staggered Striping has a better throughput than the simple striping and virtual data replication techniques for various system loads [4]. <p> We have studied a class of novel tape scheduling algorithms and shown that under light to moderate workload, this class of tape scheduling has better response time, disk buffer utilization. Also, we complement our work to the proposed Staggered Striping Architecture <ref> [4] </ref> and showed that using our proposed scheduling, how do we organize our disk layouts for current upload and display of large multimedia objects. Currently, we are studying issues of caching and replacing large objects in the disk storage system and how to support continuously variable display bandwidth objects. 30

Reference-contexts: In [4], a novel storage structure known as the staggered stripping technique was proposed as an efficient way for the delivery of multiple video or audio objects with different bandwidth demands to multiple display stations. Finally, a prototype of a continuous media disk storage server was described in <ref> [8] </ref>. It is a challenging task to implement a cost-effective continuous multimedia storage system that can store many large multimedia objects (e.g., video) and at the same time, can allow the retrieval of these objects at their playback bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: Active tasks are served in ascending order of slack time. We choose the LS algorithm for tape scheduling because both the LS algorithm and the earliest deadline algorithm are optimal for a single tape system <ref> [9] </ref> 4 in the sense that if scheduling can be achieved by any algorithm, then it can be achieved by the optimal algorithm. Both the LS and the earliest deadline algorithm are not optimal for robotic libraries with multiple tape drives [9]. <p> deadline algorithm are optimal for a single tape system <ref> [9] </ref> 4 in the sense that if scheduling can be achieved by any algorithm, then it can be achieved by the optimal algorithm. Both the LS and the earliest deadline algorithm are not optimal for robotic libraries with multiple tape drives [9]. For a single robot tape library with multiple tape drives, the LS algorithm schedules the requests (robot load or robot unload) to the robot arm by the earliest deadline algorithm. Hence, the robot arm is scheduled optimally.
