Abstract: We describe the design and calibration of a 2D airjet force perturbation device for identification of human joint mechanical properties based on our successful construction of a 1D airjet device [2]. The key advantage in these devices is that they do not impose any motion constraints on human joint movements. Our design combines two airjet actuators in a plane. We present signal processing methods to eliminate from the force measurement the ringing due to the resonance of the force sensor and the inertia force due to the airjet motion.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Perturbations have been used with success to study the overall mechanical properties of the single intact human joint and to characterize reflex activation of muscle <ref> [1] </ref>. The study of multi-joint properties is lacking because of limitations in perturbation devices. Designs using electrical or hydraulic actuators impose motion constraints or complicate the study by the dynamics of the apparatus itself.

Reference-contexts: The 1D airjet device consists of a fork shaped airjet actuator (Figure 1) and an I-beam type force sensor <ref> [2] </ref>. The air-jet actuator directs flow based on the Coanda effect. The entire actuator sits on the tip of a force sensor. After considering many design possibilities for the 2D airjet device, we chose the design shown in Figure 2 which meets the above requirements.

Reference-contexts: The arm is instrumented with a damper (Kinetrol's KD-2aa) and springs. The joint motion is monitored by an Optotrak system (Northern Digital Inc.). The force data acquisition and control are done through the Condor system <ref> [3] </ref>. The sampling rates for Optotrak and Condor systems are 500 and 1000 Hz, respectively. The force signals are conditioned by strain gauge conditioners (2B31J, Analog Devices Inc.) which have a 3 pole Bessel filter having a cutoff frequency set at 200 Hz.
