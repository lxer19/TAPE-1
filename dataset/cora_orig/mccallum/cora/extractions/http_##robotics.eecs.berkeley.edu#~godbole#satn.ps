Abstract: The problem of feedback linearization of nonlinear systems in the presence of input saturation is considered in this paper. Although different approaches for stabilization of linear and nonlinear systems under bounded controls have been suggested in the literature, the need to perform output tracking for nonlinear systems dictates the choice of feedback linearization in our control design. This method results in linear error dynamics allowing the estimation of the convergence rate. Explicit characterization of the space of feasible trajectories that can be tracked using bounded inputs is provided followed by simulation results.
