Abstract: This paper presents the visualization effort of the REINAS (Realtime Environmental Information Network Analysis System) project. REINAS is a continuing engineering research and development system with the goal of designing, developing and testing an operational prototype system for data acquisition, data management, and visualization. It includes a growing web of networked remote and in-situ instruments, a federated geographical database, and an extensible visualization interface. REINAS focuses on the needs of both oceanographers and meteorologists who monitor real-time data or analyze retrospective data. The visualization system of REINAS provides an integrated access via a distributed database to a host of different realtime data sources, numerical model forecasts, as well as more static data sets such as coastline and terrain information. It is designed as a modular tool-based system where users activate the appropriate visualization tools to generate different types of visualization products. It is also designed to be an extensible systems where tool designers can create new tools by programming and linking simpler elements together. Finally, it also supports visualization-on-demand through the WWW where visualization products using the latest available data are generated on the fly based on information obtained from a web request.

In addition, powerful general-purpose commercial visualization packages such as Data Explorer (DX) and AVS can certainly serve the purpose of making visualizations out of scientific data.

Reference-contexts: The banana slug is the mascot of our university, while PET is an acronym for Products, Elements, and Tools which reflect the architecture of the new system. The new system is being developed using OpenGL, C++, and xforms <ref> [9] </ref> for improved portability. It uses dynamic shared object libraries to facilitate phased incremental release of the system. It is also a tool-based system as opposed to a mode-based system allowing users to activate different visualization tools as needed.

Reference-contexts: These are described next. 5.1 Database query interface A graphical user interface is provided for the user to query the database via an application programmer's interface <ref> [10] </ref> that isolates the visualization applica-tion from the database development efforts. Queries are specified by three general characteristics: region of interest, time period of interest, and environmental parameter (e.g. pressure, humidity, etc).

Reference-contexts: The dataset manager then keeps track of the internal data structure used to hold the query results (see Figure 7). In addition, the dataset manager also allows static data stored in HDF <ref> [11] </ref> files to be loaded. One of the advantages of having a separate dataset manager is the reduction in data replication when datasets are processed elements within a tool. and time period of interest. 5.2 Animation controller Most data queried through the database have an associated time stamp.

Vector plot tool for displaying vector information such as those from CODAR (ocean surface current data) and vertical wind profilers. This tool provides several types of glyphs for representing vector information: arrows, barbs, and uncertainty glyphs <ref> [12] </ref>. 5.5 Multiple graphics windows During a visualization, the user may create one or more windows for the renderers to send their output. Each window may have its own region, camera, and associated set of tools. Additionally, these object may be shared across multiple windows.

Reference-contexts: was used to fly a "grid" pattern over the Monterey Bay. from both vertical wind profilers and balloon launches. 6.2 Data assimilation Data assimilation is the process of resolving the differences between observed and forecasted values and integrating updated conditions back into the numerical forecast in order to improve accuracy <ref> [13] </ref>. In the process of forecasting, incoming observational data is continuously blended into the model state in such a way as to minimize expected error. There are many parameters to this operation, all of which can have a profound effect on the final forecast.
