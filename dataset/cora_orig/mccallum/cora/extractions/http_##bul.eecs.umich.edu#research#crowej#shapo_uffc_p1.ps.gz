Abstract: Tissue elasticity can be estimated from displacement and strain images acquired under controlled deformation. We extend this approach for coronary arteries, deformed and imaged by an integrated angioplasty balloon and ultrasonic imaging probe. Because the lumen cross section of a severely occluded artery is generally not circular, we have also developed a technique to perform all motion computations in the reference frame of the lumens geometric center. This coordinate system is independent of the imaging catheter, and consequently referencing to this frame removes artifacts associated with probe motion within the balloon during deformation. Displacements and strains estimated by phasesensitive correlation-based speckle tracking were used to distinguish arterial plaques in simulated coronary arteries of differing elastic moduli: hard, soft, and homogenous. We have also applied these methods to images of a homogeneous gelatin phantom collected with the integrated probe. The spatial dependence of these quantities shows good agreement with theoretically predicted values.

Reference-contexts: These data should help predict which approach is best for each patient. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), during which a small balloon is inserted into a partially occluded artery and pressurized with fluid to expand, is the most common procedure. Long-term restenosis is the major problem with this treatment <ref> [1] </ref>. A newer approach places a metallic tube or stent inside the artery to resist restenosis. These devices, however, can be expensive and present increased risk of hemorrhage and dangerous blood clots [2]. Another option is atherectomy, in which the plaque is forcibly removed with a sharp blade.

These devices, however, can be expensive and present increased risk of hemorrhage and dangerous blood clots <ref> [2] </ref>. Another option is atherectomy, in which the plaque is forcibly removed with a sharp blade. Because tissue is actually removed, this procedure should theoretically decrease restenosis relative to PTCA. Clinical studies have shown, however, that atherectomy roughly doubles the risk of both immediate and long-term complications [3].

Clinical studies have shown, however, that atherectomy roughly doubles the risk of both immediate and long-term complications <ref> [3] </ref>. Large, highly calcified plaques with large elastic moduli are not good candidates for angioplasty because they are very stiff and the host artery may be likely to rupture rather than deform with balloon inflation.

Reference-contexts: Our general approach to elasticity imaging involves three critical steps: estimation of tissue motion under controlled deformation using phasesensitive speckle tracking, assessment of 2D tissue strain tensor elements as a function of 2 spatial variables, and elasticity reconstruction using these strain components <ref> [13] </ref>. This work focuses on the first two of these and extends their application to coronary arteries imaged with intravascular ultrasound. In the experimental work described here, an imaging catheter is mounted on the shaft within a PTCA balloon.

Reference-contexts: Since radial normal strain is the spatial derivative of u (r) in the r-direction, this quantity will be proportional to -1/r 2 . The PIST algorithm uses phasesensitive operations on locally averaged regions of consecutive images <ref> [14] </ref>. Because radial displacement estimates can be aliased for sufficient balloon pressures, a method has been developed to determine the correct balloon contour displacement based on the balloon GC. This process provides a boundary from which the absolute displacement can be calculated.

Reference-contexts: This process provides a boundary from which the absolute displacement can be calculated. Simulated arteries with different plaques were processed using PIST to verify that it can distinguish tissue by elasticity. The tissue mechanical model assumes a linearly elastic, incompressible material <ref> [15] </ref>. The beam pattern for the synthetically focused transducer array was modeled as a Gaussian radially and as an in-focus lens with f/number linearly increasing as a function of distance in the azimuthal direction. The convolution of this beam pattern with the tissue model gives simulated B-scans.

Reference-contexts: While somewhat noisy, the data are encouraging and these results agree well with simple theory. Future work will start with phantom studies including an inhomogeneous plaque. Meanwhile, a 64-element array, with greatly improved spatial resolution, will be available soon and should facilitate less noisy speckle tracking <ref> [16] </ref>. Finally, in vitro studies with diseased arteries will be the next step towards a clinical machine.
