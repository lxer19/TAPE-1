Reference-contexts: When considering biological issues involving ensembles of billions of "local" cell types, each developed from and functioning according to a single, shared, "global" genome and evaluated in terms of the "fitness" of the single resulting organism, the use of CA as a model of such "emergent" computations is especially appropriate <ref> [1] </ref>. A canonical example of such an emergent computation is to use a locally-specified CA to determine the global density of bits in an initial state configuration.

Reference-contexts: In what follows, we will assume for convenience that if n is the size of the one-dimensional lattice, n is not an integer. The best known solution to this problem for = 1=2 is the GKL rule <ref> [2] </ref>. The basic strategy taken by GKL can be viewed as consolidating regions of local homogeneity, and sending 'signals' to ambiguous regions. Solid blocks of 0's or 1's convert adjacent undecided areas to their own state.

Reference-contexts: Land & Belew: CA Density Classification 3 Attempts to evolve CA that solve this task have occupied a number of investigators. Mitchell et al. <ref> [4] </ref> used the Genetic Algorithm to find solutions to this problem for = 1=2. They were successful in finding solutions that were nearly as good as GKL. Solutions were tested by picking random initial configurations with a uniform distribution over densities.

Reference-contexts: With this distribution, their best solution was correct about 95% of the time, compared to 97.8% for GKL, on lattices of size 149 (More recent work by Mitchell has achieved better results, but still no better than GKL <ref> [5] </ref>). Experiments of our own evolving CA for the density classification task using a different representation have resulted in an automaton that may be in some ways superior to, but is roughly comparable with, that found by Mitchell.
