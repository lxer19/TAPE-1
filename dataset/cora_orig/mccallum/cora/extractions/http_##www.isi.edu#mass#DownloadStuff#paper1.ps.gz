Abstract: The use of an IMS system with its associated user interface been explored for application to robotic assembly either as a feeder or as an assembly system in itself. Simple incremental motion modalities were simulated. Experiments showed the basic operations of the IMS as an assembly work bench. An IMS, as demonstrated above, can translate, filter and orient a part in a variety of ways under program control. Only sensorless IMSs were discussed in this paper. The extensions to using an extrinsic sensor (such as a tv camera) or an intrinsic sensor (such as a strain gauge on the individual robot arm or a photocell at the base of each robot) are obvious. The addition of these sensors will allow the exploration of a different and new set of algorithms. The work here has assumed that each cell is individually controllable in mode, and direction.This puts a functionality, power and area burden and challenge on the design of the control processor required to drive each individual machine. The main issues for future study is the validation of the experiments described here in a real, physical test. This is being done in parallel hardware oriented studies. Preliminary results from at least one MEMS implementation has confirmed some of the results.These studies will be described elsewhere. [19] Software and algorithm issues requiring study include the design of an array control language since the integrated system must provide a simple control language, the design of the corresponding interpreter or compiler for loading the specific area with the motion desired, the design of the control processor residing in each cell of the array, and more experiments of the form described here.
