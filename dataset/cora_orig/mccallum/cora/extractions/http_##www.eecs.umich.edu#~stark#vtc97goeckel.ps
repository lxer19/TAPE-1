Abstract: In this paper, we present a class of multicarrier systems for studying the effect of the method of diversity allocation on coherent multi-user communication system performance over fading channels. After demonstrating that a number of popular multi-user system alternatives are represented by systems in the class, optimization over this class of systems is considered for a fixed number of users in the system. For a system where there is only multiple-access interference and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), it is observed that either the exclusive allocation or completely shared allocation is optimal for any signal-to-noise ratio and user density. For reasonable signal-to-noise ratios and user densities, it is shown that the exclusive allocation scheme is optimal in a single-cell environment with perfect subchannel separation at the receiver. Next, we consider optimization in the presence of partial-band interference. Once again, the exclusive allocation or maximum sharing scheme is observed to be optimal. The presence of the partial-band interference enlarges the region where the maximum resource sharing scheme is optimal, especially when the probability of a particular time-frequency slot experiencing interference is high.

Reference-contexts: The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, the class of systems is introduced, and the key system equivalences demonstrated in <ref> [1] </ref> are reviewed. Section 3 considers optimization over the class when the only noise not attributable to users in the system is AWGN. <p> consists of all systems described above such that L 2 f1; : : :; N g and K 2 f1; : : : ; 1g. 2.2 Timing and Receiver Assumptions In this paper, only a synchronous system will be considered although the optimization of asynchronous systems can be done similarly <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>. Although better performance for systems in the class can be obtained through the use of multi-user receivers [7], only single-user receivers will be considered here. <p> The curve in the lower left hand corner indicates the exclusive allocation systems that occur when K = L = 1. These systems are mathematical identical to a fast frequency hopping system with L independent hops per bit <ref> [1] </ref>. Moving upward in the plane increases the diversity that each user is employing, but since the system user density is fixed, this implies that each slot is shared with an increasing number of users. <p> When the diversity allocated to each user is large, systems in the class have a close performance relation to DS/CDMA systems, with equality in the limit as L ! 1 <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> pulse shape p (t) is chosen such that it results in negligible intersymbol interference on a nonselectively faded channel and the only non-system interference in the system is AWGN with two-sided power spectral density N 0 2 , the probability of error for the synchronous system can be derived as <ref> [1] </ref> P s Z 1 Q 2fl s (L; L; )f (L 1)! where Q (x) = R 1 1 p y 2 2 dy, and the signal-to interference ratio per subchannel fl s (L; L; ) is given by fl s (L; L; ) = (L 1) + L 1 <p> It is then straightforward to establish that this bound is minimized at L = 1 For the case 1, L 2 <ref> [1; N ] </ref> and the probability of error is given succinctly by P s Z 1 Q 2f ! (L 1)! It is possible to study the optimal values of L for extreme values of s . <p> Furthermore, the L = N (for N &gt; 10) case is well approximated by the L = 1 case. Thus, P s e (; 1; ) and lim L!1 P s are compared. From <ref> [1] </ref>, L = 1 is preferable whenever 1 2 1 Q 2 The convexity of Q () guarantees that Q (p) intersects a straight line at only two points. <p> Thus, we see that it requires a very large value of s for the maximum shared allocation system to be preferable to the exclusive allocation scheme. 4 Optimization in Partial-Band Interference As demonstrated in <ref> [1] </ref>, the multicarrier direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (MC/DS/CDMA) systems of [4] fit under the multicarrier framework studied here. In [4], the emphasis is on the comparison of DS/CDMA amd MC/DS/CDMA, and it is shown that MC/DS/CDMA shows markedly better performance in partial-band interference.

Reference-contexts: For this link, the fading of the users can be modeled as independent of one another. For each user, we assume the frequency-selective, time-nonselective Gaussian wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (GWSSUS) model presented in <ref> [5] </ref>. Furthermore, it will be assumed that the receiver is unable to resolve specific paths of the channel, which implies a Rayleigh fading model. A multicarrier system consists of a number of narrow-band subchannels, each of which is approximately flat faded.

It will be assumed that the fading parameters and carrier phase of the desired user's signal are estimated perfectly at the receiver of that user.
