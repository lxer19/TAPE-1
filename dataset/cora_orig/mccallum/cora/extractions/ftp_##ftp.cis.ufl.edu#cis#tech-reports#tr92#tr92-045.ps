Reference-contexts: There are different alternatives for performing fragmentation and allocation. Figure 2 illustrates some of the widely used alternatives. Apers <ref> [1] </ref> considers data fragmentation and allocation as a single problem (alternative A in Figure 2). In this paper, we take the approach B, as our primary objective of this work is to obtain an objective function that can be used to compare earlier work/algorithms on data fragmentation.

Reference-contexts: Hoffer [10] developed a non-linear, zero-one program which minimizes a linear combination of storage, retrieval and update costs, with capacity constraints for each file. Babad <ref> [2] </ref> formulated a less restrictive vertical partitioning problem for variable length attributes as a non-linear zero-one program.

Reference-contexts: Hammer and Niamir [8] use a file design cost estimator and a heuristic to arrive at a "bottom up" partitioning scheme.

In the second step, estimated cost factors reflecting the physical environment of fragment storage are considered for further refinement of the partitioning scheme. Cornell and Yu <ref> [6] </ref> propose an algorithm, as an extension of Navathe et al [18] approach, which decreases the number of disk accesses to obtain an optimal binary partitioning. This algorithm uses specific physical factors such as number of attributes, their length and selectivity, cardinality of the relation etc.

Reference-contexts: Several vertical partitioning algorithms have been proposed in the literature. Hoffer and Severance [9] measure the affinity between pairs of attributes and try to cluster attributes according to their pairwise affinity by using the bond energy algorithm (BEA) [14].

Segment sizes and scan information is used to minimize the page faults. Hammer and Niamir <ref> [8] </ref> developed two heuristics, grouping and regrouping, and used them to 7 perform the partitioning. The grouping heuristic starts by initially assigning each attribute to a different partition.

Reference-contexts: The aim of vertical partitioning technique (and in general data partitioning techniques) is to find a partitioning scheme which would satisfy the above objective. Several vertical partitioning algorithms have been proposed in the literature.

March and Severance [15] extended this model to incorporate block factors for both primary and secondary memories. Hoffer and Severance <ref> [9] </ref> grouped the attributes of a relation based on the extent to which they were used together (measured the "affinity between pairs of attributes"). This clustering of attributes based on their pairwise affinity was done using the bond energy algorithm (BEA).

Reference-contexts: Recently Chu [5] has proposed a transaction-oriented approach to at-tribute to vertical partitioning in which transaction is used as the decision variable. In addition to these vertical partitioning algorithms, there are many data clustering techniques <ref> [11] </ref>, traditionally used in pattern recognition and statistics, some of which can be adapted to partitioning of a database. These data clustering algorithms include Square-error clustering [11], Zahn's clustering [25], Nearest-neighbor clustering [13] and Fuzzy [11]clustering.

The partitioning algorithms mentioned above use some heuristics to create fragments of a relation. The input to most of these algorithms is an Attribute Usage Matrix (AUM). <p> Specifically: 1. We have, perhaps for the first time, studied the applicability of some data clustering algorithms for distributed database design 3 proposed in areas such as pattern classification, statistics etc., <ref> [11] </ref>, [25], [13], to data fragmentation problem. In fact, we start from one such objective function proposed for data clustering and modify and extend it to the specific problem at hand. 2. <p> A number of data clustering algorithms have been developed in application areas such as statistics and pattern classification and analysis which address the problem of grouping or clustering data using various criteria. The most commonly used partitioning clustering strategy is based on the square-error criterion <ref> [11] </ref>. The general objective is to obtain that partition which, for a fixed number of clusters, minimizes the square-error. Minimizing square-error, or within-cluster variation, has been shown to be equivalent to maximizing the between-cluster variation. <p> Shaffer et al [22] demonstrate the similarity of the mode-seeking partitioning algorithm [12] to the graph algorithm of Zahn [25] based on minimum spanning trees. Lu and Fu [13] used another graph-based approach called "Nearest-Neighbor clustering algorithm" to cluster patterns during character recognition <ref> [11] </ref>. The concept of using fragmentation of data as a means of improving the performance of a database management system has often appeared in the literature on file design and optimization. <p> We would like to have a number of fragments which is typically much less than n and still having the least E 2 M value. In some data clustering techniques, the number of data clusters is minimized using an index called Davies-Bouldwin (DB) index <ref> [11] </ref> which is a measure of the spread between centers of the clusters. For a typical data set with small standard deviation (less than 0:1), this index reaches a global minimum (highest spread) for a partition size that falls between the extremes. <p> For this particular example, other algorithms such as Ra's [19], Zahn's [25] and Binary Vertical Partitioning [18] identify the above mentioned partition set (i.e., 3 fragments) as optimum. In Zahn's approach, once the maximum spanning tree is obtained two different conditions can be 18 used to determine the partitions <ref> [11] </ref>. For this example, when these two conditions are applied to Zahn's algorithm, they produce two different partitioning schemes. One of them is the same as the optimal partitioning scheme obtained as above and the other one is not.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we delimit our discussion to one of the data fragmentation problems, namely the vertical partitioning problem. Vertical Partitioning (also called attribute partitioning) is a technique that is used during the design of a database to improve the performance of transactions <ref> [18] </ref>. In vertical partitioning, attributes of a relation R 1 are clustered into non-overlapping 2 groups and the relation R is projected into fragment relations according to these attribute groups. In distributed database systems, these fragments are allocated among the different sites. <p> If the fragments closely match the requirements of the set of transactions provided, then the transaction processing cost could be minimized. Vertical partitioning also has its use in partitioning individual files in centralized databases, and dividing data among different levels of memory hierarchies etc. <ref> [18, 21] </ref>. In the case of distributed databases, transaction processing cost is minimized by increasing the local processing of transactions (at a site) as well as by reducing the amount of accesses to data items that are not local. <p> Hammer and Niamir [8] use a file design cost estimator and a heuristic to arrive at a "bottom up" partitioning scheme. Navathe, et al <ref> [18] </ref> extend the BEA approach and propose a two phase approach for vertical partitioning.

During regrouping, attributes are moved between partitions to achieve any additional improvements possible. Navathe et al <ref> [18] </ref> use a two step approach for vertical partitioning. In the first step, they use the given input parameters in the form of an attribute usage matrix to construct the attribute affinity matrix on which clustering is performed. <p> In the second step, estimated cost factors reflecting the physical environment of fragment storage are considered for further refinement of the partitioning scheme. Cornell and Yu [6] propose an algorithm, as an extension of Navathe et al <ref> [18] </ref> approach, which decreases the number of disk accesses to obtain an optimal binary partitioning.
