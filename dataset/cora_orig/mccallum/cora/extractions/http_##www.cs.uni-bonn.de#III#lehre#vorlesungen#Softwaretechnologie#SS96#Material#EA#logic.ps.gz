Reference-contexts: Because of the time and space limits, I refer those interested in technical developments to the two Prolog and WAM papers by Dean Rosenzweig and myself [BoeRos94a,94b]. All references are to <ref> [1] </ref> 2 . The best I can do here is to sketch the development of ideas in my work on the subject since 1986.
