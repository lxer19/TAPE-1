Title: A High Speed Scheduler/Controller for Unbuffered Banyan Networks  
Author: C. Salisbury and R. Melhem

Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of  
Abstract: This paper describes the design of a centralized controller/scheduler for a communication switch with a Banyan switching fabric built using unbuffered switches. The controller accepts a set of connection requirements and identifies a nonconflicting subset that can be used to set the state of the switches for data transfer. The logic can be implemented using a relatively small number of gates and can be pipelined to provide rapid control of the switch fabric. The controller can be used with a replicated banyan network fabric that provides sufficient switching bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: A key performance measure of these designs is the packet loss rate. The loss rate can be reduced by using multiple banyan networks. For example, replicated architectures distribute the workload across several networks placed in parallel <ref> [1, 5] </ref>. Tandem architectures place banyan networks in a series [10]. Dilated architectures increase the number of links between switches in the banyan [5]. These architectures have been enhanced by interconnecting replicated or tandem networks using dilated links [12] or bypass connections [4].

Reference-contexts: During request processing, the controller also determines the state required at each switch. This network state information can be used to control the network and establish the selected connections. Since packets are not transmitted until the desired connection is available, requests that are not granted are resubmitted <ref> [3] </ref>, rather than recirculated. To provide satisfactory performance, the controller must be capable of determining non-conflicting sets of connection requests at a rate sufficient to handle the requests arriving from the input ports.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A wide variety of banyan-based network architectures have been developed to overcome the performance limitations imposed by blocking <ref> [9] </ref>. Many designs place control logic in the switches to buffer and / or route packets. Packets which cannot be routed correctly due to contention may be dropped or passed through the switch fabric using deflection routing.

Three policies can be considered for resubmitting requests. The first policy is that requests are never resubmitted. Requests not satisfied after a single pass through the controller are lost. With this policy, a single set of connections is developed from each set of requests. <p> In the special case where t p = mn, for some integer m, each request can be resubmitted up to m times before being discarded. Each time it is submitted, it contends with fewer requests. In this case, the only-if policy emulates a tandem network <ref> [10] </ref>. Combining this with the submission of requests from different input ports into different pipeline cycles results in the emulation of replicated tandem networks. To fully exploit the pipeline, each input port could be allowed to submit multiple requests.

Reference-contexts: Packets which cannot be routed correctly due to contention may be dropped or passed through the switch fabric using deflection routing. Packets which exit the network at an incorrect destination are undeliverable, and may be discarded or recirculated <ref> [11] </ref>. A key performance measure of these designs is the packet loss rate. The loss rate can be reduced by using multiple banyan networks. For example, replicated architectures distribute the workload across several networks placed in parallel [1, 5]. Tandem architectures place banyan networks in a series [10]. <p> A second policy is to always resubmit unsuccessful requests. Packets received by an input port are never discarded or lost. Depending on packet arrival rates, network flow control may be needed to eliminate input buffer overflows. Unsuccessful requests are resubmitted immediately and the controller emulates a recirculating banyan network <ref> [11] </ref>. A third policy is to resubmit requests subject to some condition. One approach is to resubmit requests only if no new packets have arrived at the input port.
