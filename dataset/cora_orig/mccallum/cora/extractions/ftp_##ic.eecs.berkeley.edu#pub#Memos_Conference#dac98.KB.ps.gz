Abstract: We propose a hierarchical timing analysis technique for combinational circuits under the tightest known sensitization criterion, the XBD0 delay model. Given a hierarchical combinational circuit, a generalized delay model of each leaf module is characterized first. Since this timing characterization step takes into account false paths in each module, the delay model is more accurate than the one obtained by topological analysis. Then topological delay analysis is performed on the circuit composed of generalized gates replacing the leaf modules, where the gate delay model is the derived one. As far as the authors know, this is the first result that shows that hierarchical analysis is possible under state-of-the-art tight sensitization criteria. We demonstrate by experimental results that loss of accuracy in using the hierarchical approach is very minimal in practice. The theory developed in this paper also provides a foundation for incremental timing analysis under accurate sensitization criteria.

Reference-contexts: This assumption makes hierarchical analysis trivial. However, false paths are completely ignored in this approach, thereby making more accurate analysis difficult. Recently Belkhale and Suess <ref> [1] </ref> proposed topological timing analysis under known false subgraphs. They assume that designers give the correct information on false subgraphs, which is then used to perform analysis more accurately. The falsity of a subgraph, however, is in many cases relative to arrival times at primary inputs.

Reference-contexts: This delay model is the underlying model for state-of-the-art sensitization criteria like floating mode [2] and viability [5]. We show that a conservative yet relatively accurate delay characterization of combinational modules is possible by using our recent result on exact required time analysis <ref> [4] </ref>. Delay models for leaf modules computed using this method can capture false path effects (as characterized by the tight XBD0 sensitization) inside modules, thus are guaranteed to be more accurate than those constructed by topological analysis. <p> We prove that the result is a conservative approximation to the delay obtained by flat analysis. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes exact required time analysis <ref> [4] </ref>, which forms the basis of delay characterization of combinational modules. Section 3 discusses how analysis can be done in two steps: 1) delay model construction of leaf modules and 2) top-level delay analysis. A simple example of hierarchical analysis is shown in Section 4. <p> Experimental results of this improved algorithm are reported in Section 6.

In the following, assume for simplicity that a combinational circuit under analysis has a single output. The basic idea of <ref> [4] </ref> is that given a combinational circuit and a required time at a primary output, the stability of the output at the required time can be characterized by a function of the stability of primary inputs at potential required times. <p> Notice that the notion of required times is extended from a single value to a relation between input vectors and required times at primary inputs.

Interested readers should refer to [4]. Consider a single-output combinational circuit. Let X = fx 1 ; : : : ; x n g be the set of primary inputs of the circuit and z be the primary output. Assume that a required time t = 0 is asserted at z. <p> If topological analysis is performed, the required time at x i is l i , where l i is the longest topological path delay from x i to z. Note that the required time of each input is completely independent of input values. The technique developed in <ref> [4] </ref> computes a more sophisticated input-vector-dependent constraint on required times, which is guaranteed to be looser than the one obtained by topological analysis. <p> Since the exact characterization is only practical for small circuits due to its inherent complexity, two approximate approaches were proposed in <ref> [4] </ref>. The main idea is to partially ignore interactions between inputs to simplify the analysis. The required times at the primary inputs computed in this approach are characterized as a set of timing tuples T approx R . <p> Since for each vector there may be several choices, the maximum over all vectors is not unique in general. <ref> [4] </ref> shows that an approximate algorithm based on repeated functional timing analysis can handle large circuits and that required times looser than topological analysis are obtained in many examples. In this paper we use the approximate technique to simplify the illustration.

In all the circuits, primary inputs were assumed to arrive at t = 0. Accuracy of estimated delay was fully preserved in all cases. CPU time saving of hierarchical analysis was significant.

Reference-contexts: We have experimentally shown that this approach maintains enough accuracy even with approximate timing models. The timing characterization step can be used in constructing the timing abstraction of black box modules, e.g. intellectual property blocks <ref> [8] </ref>. The delay models can be accurate without giving the internal details of black boxes.

Reference-contexts: Characterizing manually the correct condition of arrival times at the primary inputs that the falsity of a subgraph is guaranteed is error-prone. Our approach can be thought of as a way of automating this process. Yalcin and Hayes recently proposed in <ref> [9] </ref> a hierarchical timing analysis technique using conditional delays. <p> These points were not mentioned in <ref> [9] </ref>. Their experimental results on hierarchical analysis in fact are based on static sensitization, which is known to underapproximate delays also. In this paper we propose a hierarchical timing analysis technique for combinational circuits under the XBD0 delay model [6] 3 . <p> This way the delay model computed in <ref> [9] </ref> can be safely used without any underapproximation. However this is not the way they used the delay model. <p> done in the XBD0 model, required times computed follow the monotone speedup property, i.e. if a signal arrives earlier than the required time specified, it never worsens the stability of the output. 8 If T exact is used instead of T approx , one can construct the correct conditional delay <ref> [9] </ref> of the module under the XBD0 model. In general, each output has more than one conditional delay unlike the formulation in [9]. To illustrate the technique proposed in Section 3 we take a simple example. Consider a 2-bit carry-skip adder [7](page 24) shown in Figure 1. <p> time specified, it never worsens the stability of the output. 8 If T exact is used instead of T approx , one can construct the correct conditional delay <ref> [9] </ref> of the module under the XBD0 model. In general, each output has more than one conditional delay unlike the formulation in [9]. To illustrate the technique proposed in Section 3 we take a simple example. Consider a 2-bit carry-skip adder [7](page 24) shown in Figure 1. Cascading this adder n times yields a carry-skip adder of 2n bits.
