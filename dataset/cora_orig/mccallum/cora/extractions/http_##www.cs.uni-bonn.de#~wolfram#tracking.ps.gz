Abstract: One of the main problems in the field of mobile robotics is the estimation of the robot's position in the environment. Position probability grids have been proven to be a robust technique for the estimation of the absolute position of a mobile robot. In this paper we describe an application of position probability grids to the tracking of the position of the robot. The main difference of our method to previous approaches lies in the fact that the position probability grid technique is a Bayesian approach which is able to deal with noisy sensors as well as ambiguities and is able to integrate sensor readings of different types of sensors over time. Given a starting position this method estimates the robot's current position by matching sensor readings against a metric model of the environment. Results described in this paper illustrate the robustness of this method against noisy sensors and errors in the environmental model.

Reference-contexts: Position tracking in large environments As a complex example we used a typical run of RHINO in the arena of the 1994 Mobile robot competition [12]. Fig ures 2 and 3 show the occupancy grid map of the arena constructed with the map-building tool of the RHINO system <ref> [1, 15] </ref>. The size of the environment amounts 20 fi 30m 2 . The sonar sensor measurements as well as the position information of the wheel encoders were recorded during a run through this arena. Figure 2 includes the path of the robot as measured by the wheel-encoders.

Reference-contexts: Position tracking in fact can be regarded as a special case of estimating the absolute position, because it uses a restricted search space generally centered around the robot's predicted position instead of considering each point in environment as a possible position. In <ref> [2] </ref> we introduced the position probability grid as a robust technique for the estimation of the absolute position of a mobile robot in its envir 1 In the remainder of this paper we use the notion position to refer to position and orientation if not stated otherwise. onment. <p> Thus the grid provides a discrete approximation of the probability function of the robot's current position. The approximation is adapted by integrating the likelihoods of sensor information over time. These likelihoods are computed by matching the measurements against a given environmental model. In <ref> [2] </ref> we showed that position probability grids are a robust technique allowing a mobile robot to determine its absolute position in typical office environments within a short time. In this paper we describe a specialization of the position probability grid approach to the tracking problem. <p> By integrating the likelihoods of measurements over time, it provides a discrete approximation of the position probability density function. 3. Position tracking with position probability grids The position probability grid approach <ref> [2] </ref> initially has been designed to estimate the absolute position of a mobile robot in a known environment. The basic idea of this approach is to provide a discrete approximation of the position probability density function for the given environment. <p> Then the probability of x referring to the current position of the robot given new sensory input s n is defined as <ref> [2] </ref>: p (x j s 1 ^ : : : ^ s n1 ^ s n ^ m) = The constant ff simply normalizes the sum of the position probabilities over all x up to 1 [10]. <p> Therefore, the value p (x j m) is computed as follows: p (x j m) = P (6) 5. Experimental results The position probability grid technique has been implemented and extensively tested for the estimation of the absolute position <ref> [2] </ref> and the tracking problem. The current system is able to interpret sensor readings of ultrasonic sensors and match them against occupancy probability grid maps.

Related work Different techniques for the tracking of the position of mobile vehicles by map-matching have been developed in the past (see <ref> [3, 4] </ref> for overviews).

Reference-contexts: The problem of estimating the robot's position can be divided into two sub-problems: the estimation of the absolute position in the environment and the tracking of the robot's position relative to a given starting point <ref> [4] </ref>. The task of the tracking techniques is the correction of accumulated dead reckoning errors coming from the inherent inaccuracy of the wheel encoders and other factors such as slipping. <p> Finally, Section 5 describes experiments with this application in typical office environments. 2.

Reference-contexts: The local map is matched against the global map to produce a position and orientation estimate. This estimate is combined with the previous estimate using a Kalman filter <ref> [6] </ref>, where the uncertainty is represented by the width of the Gaussian distribution. Compared to the approach of Wei et al., our technique allows an integration of different measurements over time rather than taking the optimum match of the most recent sensing as a guess for the current position. <p> An interesting question concerns the relation of the position probability grid technique to Kalman filters <ref> [6, 14] </ref> as applied in [11]. The difference between both approaches lies in the approximation of the position probability density function. Whereas our method provides a discrete approximation of this function, Kalman filters approximate the overall distribution by a Gaussian density function.
