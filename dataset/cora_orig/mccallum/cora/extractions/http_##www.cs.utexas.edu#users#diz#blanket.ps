Title: Multiple Cover Time  
Author: Peter Winkler and David Zuckerman 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in Markov estimation and distributed computing, we define the blanket time of an undirected graph G to be the expected time for a random walk to hit every vertex of G within a constant factor of the number of times predicted by the stationary distribution. Thus the blanket time is, essentially, the number of steps required of a random walk in order that the observed distribution reflect the stationary distribution. We provide substantial evidence for the following conjecture: that the blanket time of a graph never exceeds the cover time by more than a constant factor. In other words, at the cost of a multiplicative constant one can hit every vertex often instead of merely once. We prove the conjecture in the case where the cover time and maximum hitting time differ by a logarithmic factor. This case includes almost all graphs, as well as most "nat-ural" graphs: the hypercube, k-dimensional lattices for k 2, balanced k-ary trees, and expanders. We further prove the conjecture for perhaps the most natural graphs not falling in the above case: paths and cycles. Finally, we prove the conjecture in the case of independent stochastic processes.

Reference-contexts: We support this conjecture with three results. To motivate the first, one very useful bound on the cover times is C = O (H log n) <ref> [1, 18] </ref>. We strengthen this by showing that in fact B = O (H log n). This establishes our conjecture in the very common case where C = fi (H log n). <p> We strengthen this by showing that in fact B = O (H log n).

Reference-contexts: Although the cover time problem is solved, the literature does not appear to supply the means for computing blanket time in the non-uniform case. However, using a result of Aldous <ref> [2] </ref> we are able to derive the result for independent stochastic processes from our theorem below, which covers Markov chains in which C = fi (H log n). <p> Aldous <ref> [2] </ref>). This gives Corollary 2 For independent stochastic processes, B 1* = O (C=* 2 ): Note also that if there is a constant number of hard-to-hit vertices, then S and C are both fi (H), so the conjecture is proved in this case. Proof of Theorem.
