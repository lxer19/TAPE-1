Abstract: 1 This work is sponsored by DARPA under Fort Huachuca Contract No. DABT-63-92-C-0052 Abstract: In this paper we will derive an offline sensorless (open loop) dynamic control algorithm for moving parts on an Intelligent Motion Surface (IMS), along paths composed of sequences of straight line segments. The algorithm uses a dynamic squeeze force field to move parts around the IMS, assuming the dynamic force field will abruptly stop at the end of each straight line segment. We assume the path is given a priori, being obtained using one of the several well-known path planning methods available in the literature. Initially, we will derive the algorithm assuming the part is a particle coincident with its center of mass. Later, we will relax this assumption, making the necessary modifications to the algorithm to take into account the parts geometry.

Reference-contexts: The work presented here extends our previous results on designing sensorless dynamic control algorithms for paths composed of a single straight line segment <ref> [1] </ref>. We assume the path is given a priori, being obtained using one of the several well-known path planning methods available in the literature [6]. Initially, we will derive the algorithm assuming the part is a particle coincident with its center of mass. <p> From now on, up to section 6, the words part and particle will be used interchangeably. 2. Using dynamic force fields to move parts between work cells Dynamic force fields have been introduced as a means of moving parts on an IMS <ref> [1] </ref>. A dynamic force field is a sub-region of the IMS that has its shape and/or position within the IMS changed on a time-varying basis. <p> The idea is to put a force field around a part and move the force field in a continuous or discrete way, dragging the part along with the field (see Figure 1.) A realistic model of the movement of dynamic force fields was derived in <ref> [1] </ref>, taking into account the discrete placement of the manipulators on the IMS surface. It was shown that the overall movement of the dynamic force field is not continuous, being limited to integer multiples of the length of the manipulators along the direction of movement. <p> This overall movement constraint affects the dynamics of parts being manipulated and how fast we can move the dynamic force field without losing the part during the movement. This last problem is defined as the capture condition <ref> [1] </ref>. 3. Moving parts along a straight line segment using a squeeze force field A design goal of our algorithms is to maximize throughput. In order to achieve that, we need to move parts robustly and fast between work cells. <p> Robustly implies that we will enforce the capture condition at all times. Fast implies that we will choose a particular dynamic force field and move it in such a way that the part will gain as much velocity as possible. In <ref> [1] </ref>, we have derived a sensorless (open loop) dynamic control algorithm that enforces the capture condition while moving a part along a single straight line path, using a squeeze force field (see Figure 2.) The algorithm consists of moving the squeeze force field by a fixed distance d using nonuniform time <p> In this case, special care must be taken to avoid overshooting the part, that is, throwing the part outside the squeeze force field when it stops moving. The formulas presented in <ref> [1] </ref> where derived taking this case into account. part initially stabilized; (b) At the next time step, the squeeze vector force field is moved by a distance d (not continuously), instantaneously placing the part at a distance d from the center line. 3.1. <p> The dynamics of the movement using a squeeze force field In this section we will overview the differential equation derived in <ref> [1] </ref>, that governs the movement of a particle on a squeeze force field, moving along a straight line path. Without loss of generality, lets assume that the direction of the straight line path coincides with the (positive) x-axis direction. <p> part will be thrown outside the squeeze region (the capture condition will fail.) Given the distance L between the start and final goal positions (that is, the total distance we should move the dynamic squeeze force field), and the maximum squeeze force F, a set of formulas were derived in <ref> [1] </ref> to compute the appropriate values of R, d, and n (see the entire movement. In this paper, we will extend these formulas to cope with paths composed by a sequence of several consecutive straight line segments (and not just one.) 4. <p> Computing the settling time for the abrupt stop case. Lets assume the dynamic force field abruptly stops at time step n. As soon as it stops, the part will penetrate a distance of <ref> [1] </ref>: d F f depth n = 2 (eq. 2) into the right side region of the squeeze force field, where v n is the velocity of the part at the end of time step n. As in [1], we are assuming without loss of generality that the movement is being <p> As soon as it stops, the part will penetrate a distance of <ref> [1] </ref>: d F f depth n = 2 (eq. 2) into the right side region of the squeeze force field, where v n is the velocity of the part at the end of time step n. As in [1], we are assuming without loss of generality that the movement is being made along the (positive) x-axis direction. Figure 6 (a) shows the part positioned at a distance d depth from the center line. At this point, the part has a zero instantaneous velocity. <p> Basically, the proposed algorithm can be subdivided into two parts. The first part consists of enforcing the capture condition at all times, while moving the part along each straight line segment defined in the path. This can be accomplished using the algorithm derived in <ref> [1] </ref>, for each straight line segment. The second part consists of enforcing the capture condition while switching movement directions between consecutive straight line segments of the path.

Reference-contexts: The array is usually built from simple manipulators, each capable of moving in one single direction. The appropriate choice of force fields can move objects in manners that are suitable for mechanical assembly operations such as rotation, translation, orientation, alignment, parts feeder, and spatial filtering, among others <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> We envisage the IMS being used as a workbench with several work cells, where parts are manipulated and assembled in each work cell, and are transported between work cells (see Figure 1.)

However, most of them are based on quasi-static analysis, not being applicable for the case of dynamically controlling the movement of parts between work cells.
