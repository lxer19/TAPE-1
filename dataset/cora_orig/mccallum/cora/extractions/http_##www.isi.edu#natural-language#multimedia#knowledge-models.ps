Abstract: We address one of the problems at the heart of automated multimedia presentation production and interpretation. The media allocation problem can be stated as follows: how does the producer of a presentation determine which information to allocate to which medium, and how does a perceiver recognize the function of each part as displayed in the presentation and integrate them into a coherent whole? What knowledge is used, and what processes? We describe the four major types of knowledge that play a role in the allocation problem as well as interdependencies that hold among them. We discuss two formalisms that can be used to represent this knowledge and, using examples, describe the kinds of processing required for the media allocation problem.

Reference-contexts: For our purposes, we have chosen to borrow and adapt a partial classification of a producer's communicative goals from existing work on Speech Acts. Figure 5 provides a small portion of the network containing aspects of a producer's communicative intentions that may affect the appearance of a presentation (see <ref> [Vossers 91] </ref> for more details). In this network fragment is distinguished from because, unlike inform speech acts, the semantics of warnings involve capturing the attention of the reader in order to affect his/her goals or actions. <p> Existing research provides considerable material with a bearing on the topic, including especially the work in Cognitive Psychology on issues of human perception which influence the appropriateness of media choices for presentation of certain types of data. A survey and discussion of these results is presented in <ref> [Vossers 91] </ref>.
