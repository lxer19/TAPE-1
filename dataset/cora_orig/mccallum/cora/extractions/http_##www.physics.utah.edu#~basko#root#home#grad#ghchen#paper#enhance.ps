Abstract: We studied the relationship between the spin-orbit (SO) coupling and the long range coulomb interaction. With the Hartree-Fock approximation, we analytically demonstrate the SO interaction will be enhanced as ff eff = ff 1 r s 4:44 [1:1+ln( k F ffik )] . Furthermore, we verify such a enhacement survives in the frame of random phase approximation(RPA) with local field field correction. Remarkbally, this enhancement will be suppressed by the magnetic field through the Zeeman splitting. PACS numbers: 73.20.Dx, 73.20.Hb, 74.20-z
