Title: Computer Break-ins: A Case Study*  
Author: Leendert van Doorn 
Address: Amsterdam, The Netherlands  
Affiliation: Vrije Universiteit  
Abstract: Computer break-ins are getting more common every day. Log files and even program binaries are changed, making it very hard for the system administrators to assess the damage and track down the intruders. This paper describes the modus operandi of hackers based on multiple hacking attempts that occurred during this year at some department computers. Special attention is paid to the methods they use to break into computer systems and what they do once they are in.

Reference-contexts: This is mainly caused by the technological change that took place during this last decade: Computers are interconnected using networks [7] and most systems even rely on this. For example, a network operating system like SunOS, which is based on the client/server abstraction <ref> [1] </ref> (where client and servers reside on different machines) relies heavily on its interconnection. Unfortunately, network operating system designers have the tendency to model the network as an extension of the internal data bus.

Reference-contexts: The latest NIS, NFS and many more security software fixes for SUN computers can be found in ftp.uu.net:/systems/sun/sun-fixes, or from be obtained your own vendor. A very useful tool to detect security weaknesses (possibly caused by hackers) is the freely available program called COPS <ref> [2] </ref>. A copy of COPS can be found in cert.sei.cmu.edu:/pub/tools/cops. 6. Reflections All the break-ins described in this paper could have been prevented when the administrators of the attacked systems were more aware of computer security.

Reference-contexts: In line with the UNIX philosophy, passwords are stored in an encrypted form in a public readable file. This file was readable since the designers did not think that a brute force attack was feasible [5]. However studies <ref> [4] </ref> showed that given an English, French, and Dutch dictionary, a list of male and female names, and a lot of clever permutations of them, 25% of the passwords can be broken.

Reference-contexts: Most of them misused this trust system by planting a .rhosts that allowed full access from anywhere into a home directory, using NFS, or FTP. Network file system Sun's network file system (NFS) <ref> [6] </ref> is a system that allows system administrators to mount file systems that reside on remote computers in exactly the same manner as they would mount a local disk.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Computer break-ins are much more common now days than they were, say, ten years ago. This is mainly caused by the technological change that took place during this last decade: Computers are interconnected using networks <ref> [7] </ref> and most systems even rely on this.

Reference-contexts: You should always examine your log files regularly, especially the files generated by the system log service and the wtmp file. Watch for connections made from unusual hosts or at unusual times (Wietze Venema's TCP wrapper package <ref> [8] </ref> is very useful in this respect). Also accounts that have been unused for a while and start being used again are suspect. A common rule is that hackers usually go about their business between the hours of 18.00 and 8.00, and on Saturdays, Sundays, and national holidays.
