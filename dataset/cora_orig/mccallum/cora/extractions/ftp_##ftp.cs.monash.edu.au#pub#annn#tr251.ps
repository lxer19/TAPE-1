Reference-contexts: More recently researchers have used belief networks in dynamic domains such as the fall diagnosis problem, where the world changes and the focus is reasoning over time [7, 11, 15, 10] Such dynamic applications include robot navigation and map learning based on temporal belief networks [7], monitoring diabetes <ref> [1] </ref>, monitoring robot vehicles [13], oil forecasting [5], [17], forecasting sleep apnea [4], automated vehicle control [8] and traffic plan recognition [18]. For such applications the network grows over time, as the state of each domain variable at different times is represented by a series of nodes.

Reference-contexts: Timing data for the observations is also given.

In Sect. 4 we develop a complete belief network model for the fall diagnosis problem, with results given in Sect. 5.

Reference-contexts: Second there is no distinction between actual states of the world and observations of that state, for example, the fall state is really a fall-alarm state. That is, there is no explicit representation of the uncertainty in the sensor observation 4 <ref> [14] </ref>. <p> They provide the foundation for the dynamic construction of the network, identifying when the nodes for a new time slice should be added. An example of event observation is the robot vehicle monitoring in <ref> [14] </ref>: the environment (a laboratory in which a robot vehicle roams) is divided into regions by the light-beam sensors, which provide observations on events where an agent (person or robot) moves between regions. 6 3.4 Representing actions For planning and monitoring applications, it is often useful to have the action as <p> It represents adequately the underlying assumptions about the data uncertainty, however it does not provide an explanation of why the observed sensor data might be incorrect. We can represent the most usual source of incorrect data, namely a defective sensor, by the addition of a sensor status node SS <ref> [14] </ref> for each sensor.

The types of nodes are: World nodes, which describe the central domain variables (for example, position, heading, velocity) variables; Event nodes, which represent a change in the state of a world node; Observation nodes, which represent direct observations of world nodes, or the observable effects of an event. <p> In <ref> [15] </ref>, where the observations are on the light beam sensor crossing events, the action structure is added together with additional structure which maintains information about movement trends, and provides a conditional probability for the action. 4 Basic DBN Model for Fall Diagnosis Davies's state machine essentially defines the fall diagnosis problem <p> This is represented in a DBN by the use of a history node <ref> [15] </ref>, which maintains a count of how long the agent has been exhibiting one type of behaviour. For our domain, this would be a status history node, H i , for each time slice; its predecessors are the previous and current walking status nodes, S i1 and S i .

Given the problems with combining continuous and discrete variables <ref> [19, p.465] </ref> and the limitations of the sensor, node T has discrete values representing tenths of seconds. 2 Note that we can easily extend the model to handle a person jumping, by adding an additional possible value for A, say jump. 8 While the fact that there is no obvious upper
