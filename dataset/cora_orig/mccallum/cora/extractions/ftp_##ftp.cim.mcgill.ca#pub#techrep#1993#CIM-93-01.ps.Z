Reference-contexts: This has also been termed surroundedness in the past [ 16 ][ 19 ] . Historically, artists have realized the connection between the perception of figure and the degree to which a region is enclosed <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> . Early work which explicitly examined this issue was performed by Rubin [ 20 ] . He studied multi-stable figure/ground phenomena in conjunction with ambiguous contours where the perception of figure and ground oscillates between two stable values. <p> Using this argument, it has been possible to explain some common visual phenomena. For example, the perception of a circular contour may be quite different depending on whether the focus of gaze is on the central or surrounding region <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> . In the first case, a filled circular disk is more likely to be seen as figure since the 5 contour is concave with respect to the fixation point. In the latter case, the percept is more like a hole existing in a figural plane.

Reference-contexts: We will outline a method which overcomes some of these limitations, thereby providing a practical tool for identifying and quantifying enclosure in complex images. The practical application of techniques which use symmetry information (such as the Medial Axis Transform <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> ) have generally been limited since the inside of an object must be known a priori. The identification of these interior regions requires that a segmentation operation occur prior to symmetry extraction. <p> The surroundedness metric is then just the summation of all angles where an intersection occurs (see Figure 1.6). This metric is similar in nature to the modified winding 10 (numbered) is sampled from a fixed point p by sweeping a ray through the angular range 2 <ref> [0; 2] </ref>. (b) Instances where contours are intersected are recorded as a function of the angular position . The angular interval corresponding to the i th contour fragment has a length i . The degree of surroundedness S is computed by taking the summation of all intervals. <p> For a given value of , the presence or absence of an intersection is recorded. Hence, the resulting angular profile is a binary function of the form S p () where 2 <ref> [0; 2] </ref>. It is clear that the extent of individual break angles ff may be read directly from such a profile. 2.2 Symmetric Enclosure for Non-Circular Contours We now consider how these ideas extend to non-circular contours. <p> This is equivalent to many existing computational approaches which have extracted symmetry-based representations by using the analogy of `maximal discs' which are bitangent to the contour <ref> [ 2 ] </ref>[ 18 ] . In our work, rather than detect fl This same argument can be made for any arbitrary number of fragments whose combined arclength sums to fi. <p> angular position .

This profile corresponds to complete enclosure for the particular annular region shown. When a single break is introduced, the angular scope of the break is reflected in the angular profile (see angle 1 .

Reference-contexts: Research performed during the 1940's used the term closure to refer to the process whereby disconnected shape components are perceived to be parts of a single whole, as measured using so-called completion tests <ref> [ 4 ] </ref> . The results of this branch of research were rather inconclusive in resolving the mechanisms underlying the perceptual phenomenon of grouping. Recent research has begun to re-kindle interest in the perceptual significance of contour closure.

Reference-contexts: From this point onward, we will use the term contour to represent a set of planar curves. The most fundamental case of enclosure occurs when the contour consists of a simple closed planar curve. Here, the Jordan Curve Theorem <ref> [ 5 ] </ref> provides a means for defining the inside and outside of the curve based upon the fact that the contour partitions the plane into two sets. The bounded region of these two sets is labelled as the inside.

Reference-contexts: It is important to note that closure in the perceptual sense can be considered as a graded quantity, and does not require connectivity between contour elements [ 8 ] . More recent psychophysical findings by Elder have substantiated this <ref> [ 6 ] </ref> , with evidence suggesting that varying degrees of closure do exist. Results from this work appear to indicate that a human's ability to perceive shape is directly influenced by contour closure. <p> Therefore, it is assumed that the relationship between the size of area enclosed by a circular contour and the angular extent of its break angles is a nonlinear one. It has been observed by Elder <ref> [ 6 ] </ref> that in situations involving multiple contour breaks, those with the largest extent tend to have a more profound impact in decreasing the speed at which a figure is perceived. <p> Hence, there have been several previous attempts made to develop appropriate computational strategies for analysis. Some of these have been reviewed in depth by Elder <ref> [ 6 ] </ref> . However, it has been difficult to find analytical tools which are capable of fully explaining the perceptual phenomena of enclosure that was demonstrated in the above examples. Mathematics provides a precise means for determining whether a curve is closed or not. <p> The angular interval corresponding to the i th contour fragment has a length i . The degree of surroundedness S is computed by taking the summation of all intervals. For this example, S = P 5 11 number method proposed by Elder <ref> [ 6 ] </ref> . The winding number is a mathematical tool used to quantify the number of complete (integer) encirclements that a curve makes about a chosen point [ 14 ] . <p> There is also the complicating factor of scale when employing a winding number metric for enclosure <ref> [ 6 ] </ref> . Suppose we consider two sets of contour fragments located at vastly different distances from the external point. <p> This limitation has motivated us to employ annular symmetry operators as a means for separating enclosing structures as a function of regional scale. <ref> [ 6 ] </ref> ) Relative to the external point p the contour has a unity winding number which indicates a completely closed contour. However, we see that the enclosing structures occur at two different scales. <p> The concept of containment has been linked to the phenomenon of contour enclosure by others <ref> [ 6 ] </ref> . In our second analogy, the capacity for a boundary to contain variable sized particles is considered. Two dimensional particles represented by disks are contained within the confines of a circular contour.

Reference-contexts: Further confusion is found when the term closure is related to the mathematical notion of closed curves. While methods have been developed for quantifying the degree of closure for non-closed (mathematically) curves <ref> [ 7 ] </ref>[ 9 ] , we shall see that there is a fundamental difference between this and the surrounding phenomenon that has been associated with the perceptual separation of figure from ground (see Section 1.5). <p> Although this new metric is better for explaining a spiral situation, it still cannot adequately explain the nonlinear dependence on break angles discussed in the previous section. Previously we have alluded to the fundamental difference between the mathematical notion of curve closure and that of enclosure. The authors of <ref> [ 7 ] </ref> have proposed a model for quantifying the degree of closure for non-closed curves by deriving a measure based 12 on the sizes of contour gaps measured relative to the overall closed contour arclength (see convex polygons in image data [ 9 ] . <p> By expressing these values relative to the overall arclength ( ff l ), one can derive an expression for the degree of curve closure whereby the closure decreases in proportion to the size of the gaps <ref> [ 7 ] </ref> . 13 having one gap. (b) Its closed counterpart has an arclength l. (c) The size of the contour gap is measured along the closed contour, resulting in value ff. <p> We note that equation (2.1) has a form which is similar to the closure measure proposed in <ref> [ 7 ] </ref> . However, we recall that there is a fundamental difference between the notion of closure presented in this work and the notion of enclosure that we employ here (see Section 1.5). <p> <ref> [ 7 ] </ref> . However, we recall that there is a fundamental difference between the notion of closure presented in this work and the notion of enclosure that we employ here (see Section 1.5). In terms of quantifying enclosure, we therefore employ a modified version of the measure introduced in [ 7 ] . For a given annulus, we consider only those contour fragments which fall within the corresponding annular region. We recall that this set of fragments is treated as equivalent to a fragmented circular contour (see Section 2.2). <p> We recall that this set of fragments is treated as equivalent to a fragmented circular contour (see Section 2.2). Hence, for an annular region, we can make an analogy with the method used in <ref> [ 7 ] </ref> . Rather than expressing the size of contour gaps relative to the overall contour arclength, we instead express the size of break angles found in the associated angular profile relative to a closed circular contour. This results in normalized values of the form i 2 . <p> This results in normalized values of the form i 2 . By modelling enclosure using two simple physical analogies (see Appendix 2.4), we arrive at the values - = 2:35 and - = 1:75 for the exponent in equation (2.1). We note that the visual search results of <ref> [ 7 ] </ref> were best described in terms of a model based on an L 2 norm. <p> Both of the exponent values that were found based on physical analogies are close to the exponent - = 2 that was used to quantify closure in <ref> [ 7 ] </ref> . 24 3. Summary In this report we have introduced the idea of symmetric enclosure.

Reference-contexts: One further property found to be linked with the perception of figure is symmetry. Objects exhibiting a high degree of symmetry are more likely to be seen as figure [ 16 ] .

However, the term has also been used for describing various grouping processes - specifically those associated with so-called "memory trace" processes <ref> [ 15 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: One factor which appears to influence the perceptual distinction between figure and ground is the extent to which regions are enclosed by a given contour. This has also been termed surroundedness in the past <ref> [ 16 ] </ref>[ 19 ] . Historically, artists have realized the connection between the perception of figure and the degree to which a region is enclosed [ 1 ] . Early work which explicitly examined this issue was performed by Rubin [ 20 ] . <p> This is consistent with the fact that the contour is now convex relative to the fixation point.

Reference-contexts: However, such a binary definition does not allow for varying degrees of closure to be measured, and there are no formal mathematical methods which deal with this as such. Points falling on the inside of a closed curve may be viewed to be topologically surrounded by the curve <ref> [ 17 ] </ref> . However, once a break is introduced the situation changes from a topological standpoint. A broken curve is topologically equivalent to a straight line segment and thus it no longer partitions the plane in the same way.

Reference-contexts: As the author points out, this method is severely limited since it assumes fully closed contours in isolation. One paper published within the computational vision community has made a direct attempt at the quantification of enclosure. In this work, entitled, "Degree of Adjacency or Surroundedness" <ref> [ 19 ] </ref> , Rosenfeld establishes a mathematical formalism which deals with enclosure. As with Ullman's method, he first defines a point to be surrounded by a contour if any path from that point to infinity intersects the contour. <p> However, we see that the enclosing structures occur at two different scales. To appropriately interpret the enclosing configuration requires that we adopt a method that will separate structures as a function of scale. In <ref> [ 19 ] </ref> , the authors propose a second metric which partially compensates for the inadequacies of the first. It is based upon the intuitive notion that a point becomes more enclosed as the path required for it to escape from the contour becomes less linear.

Reference-contexts: Her results indicated that a degree of closure could be associated with the gap size in a contour and with the retinal size of a projected figure. These results also pointed to closure as being a graded quantity. Research begun in the 1970's by Treisman and her colleagues <ref> [ 21 ] </ref> began to uncover evidence suggesting the role of closure during the performance of psychophysical search tasks. <p> Here, closure is viewed as being an "emergent feature" which is extracted from a set of viewed curves: "...the perceptual definition of closure does not require connected lines but simply a space that is partially enclosed by a convex contour." <ref> [ 21 ] </ref> Evidence from this research suggested that the degree of contour closure had a direct effect in mediating the response times found during visual search tasks.

Reference-contexts: It is clear that the limited mathematical definitions of closure will not be applicable in situations involving disconnected curve segments. Thus, in order to explain the perceptual phenomenon of enclosure, we need to look beyond these definitions. In his paper on visual routines, Ullman <ref> [ 22 ] </ref> proposes several simple heuristics for determining whether a point p is inside or outside a curve. The "ray intersection method" employs a ray emanating from the point in question outwards in an arbitrary direction. The number of instances the ray crosses contour segments is recorded.
