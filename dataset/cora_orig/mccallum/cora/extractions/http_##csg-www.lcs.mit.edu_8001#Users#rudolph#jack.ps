Reference-contexts: Some bus arbitration schemes use one request line per master and all the lines are feed into an arbitration circuit this assume no more than a dozen or so masters. A daisy chaining, or token passing approach is also common <ref> [3] </ref>. But these cases do not scale very well. Our solution will be closest in spirit to distributed arbitration schemes for buses, but will be suitable for very large numbers of masters.

Reference-contexts: But these cases do not scale very well. Our solution will be closest in spirit to distributed arbitration schemes for buses, but will be suitable for very large numbers of masters. The special-purpose electro-optical hardware is based on a proposal by Dror Feitelson <ref> [6] </ref> to build a true CRCW (Concurrent-Read, Concurrent-Write) memory with free-space optics. His observation is that with free-space optical commu (VERSION OF TITLE FOR HEADLINE) 5 nication, the direction of a light beam can be exploited. <p> If light is imaged to both detectors (by different PEs), then an arbitrary state is chosen. We note in passing that it is difficult to extend this scheme to provide a multiple bit word of CRCW memory (we know of some less than satisfying solutions <ref> [6] </ref>). The scheme for a CRCW memory bit can be modified to provide arbitration hardware. A read-modify-write type of functionality is provided by putting a beam splitter in front of the shutter and imaging some of the incoming "reading" light into the detectors of the memory bit (see Figure 3).

Reference-contexts: One major, often cited use for free-space optical communication is to support the information interchange needs of parallel processors [2]. The shortcomings of traditional electronic means has been known for a long time. For example, in 1981, when Jack Schwartz <ref> [7] </ref> proposed a realizable approximation to the more desirable "paracomputer" model of parallel computation, he noted that fan-in fan-out limitations of electronics imply that a multistaged interconnection network is required to send messages to all processors.

Reference-contexts: For the detector, D and d are similarly defined. detector array. Tewksbury <ref> [8] </ref> breifly considered a related problem in which the source and destination arrays are misaligned by a rotation around the center axis. We assume an array of transmitters that are on one chip and an array of detectors on a second chip.
