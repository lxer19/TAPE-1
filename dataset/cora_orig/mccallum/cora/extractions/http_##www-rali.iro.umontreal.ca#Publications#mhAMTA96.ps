Abstract: We present a quantitative evaluation of one well-known word alignment algorithm, as well as an analysis of frequent errors in terms of this models underlying assumptions. Despite error rates that range from 22% to 32%, we argue that this technology can be put to good use in certain automated aids for human translators. We support our contention by pointing to certain successful applications and outline ways in which text alignments below the sentence level would allow us to improve the performance of other translation support tools.

See Brousseau et al. <ref> [1] </ref> for more details. These, and the other systems alluded to above, demonstrate that the performance of current alignment algorithms, although far from perfect, is certainly sufficient to support the development of what is justifiably called a new generation of translation support tools.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Considerable effort has been invested in the past few years in developing what has been called a new generation of translation support tools based on parallel text alignment (Brown et al. <ref> [2] </ref>; Gale and Church [8]; Isabelle et al. [10]). <p> The first published algorithms for aligning sentences in parallel texts were proposed by Gale and Church [8] and Brown et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. Based on the observation that the length of a text and the length of its translation are highly correlated, they calculate the most likely sentence correspondences as a function of the relative length of the candidates.

Reference-contexts: This process does away with the need for finding sentence and/or paragraph boundaries, a task which can be quite difficult for noisy input texts. 2.3.2 Word Alignment As part of their efforts to develop a statistical machine translation system, Brown et al. <ref> [3] </ref> outline a series of five increasingly complex translation models that can also be used to establish word alignments. <p> The statistical translation models are quite technical, so we will only attempt to outline their general properties in laymans terms here; the mathematically fearless reader is referred to Brown et al. <ref> [3] </ref> for an explanation of the intricacies of the underlying statistical calculations. All of the models are based on the notion that every target string, T, is a possible translation of a given string of source words, S. <p> To help us answer these questions, we undertook a small-scale study of word alignment outputs produced by our own alignment program, known as TM-Align. This program is based directly on Model 2, the second in the series of statistical translation models defined by Brown et al. <ref> [3] </ref>. It was trained on a bilingual corpus of 74 million words drawn from the Canadian Hansards, and includes a vocabulary of 92 129 word forms in English and 114 517 word forms in French. <p> The words underlined in each sentence pair were properly aligned by the program.) As Brown et al. <ref> [3] </ref> remark, number is not invariant across translation (p.286): (i) [Comment pouvons nous mener de bonnes ngotiations commerciales... How can we have a proper negotiation on trade when... #850] Of course, number is not the only grammatical property that may vary across translation. <p> The problem is not just with Model 2; none of the translation models of Brown et al. <ref> [3] </ref> allow for what they call general alignments of phrases to phrases, although they do of course recognize that these may be required for some translations. <p> Such 8. If the order of Canadian and federation is inverted in (vii), TM-Align does correctly connect canadienne and Canadian. 9. This is actually deliberate, since Brown et al. <ref> [3] </ref> intend the translation component embodied by Model 2 to work in conjunction with a separate target language model within their larger statistical MT system. connections are clearly not warranted here. This, then, is a serious inadequacy inherent in the at representations of Brown et al. [3]: they cannot simultaneously express <p> since Brown et al. <ref> [3] </ref> intend the translation component embodied by Model 2 to work in conjunction with a separate target language model within their larger statistical MT system. connections are clearly not warranted here. This, then, is a serious inadequacy inherent in the at representations of Brown et al. [3]: they cannot simultaneously express correspondences between higher-level units while at the same time indicating that some of the words within those units are mutual translations and others are not. For this, a richer kind of hierarchical representation would be required. <p> A straightforward solution to this problem would be to add a morphological analysis component to the system, so that all the different forms of a word could be related to the same lexeme. Brown et al. <ref> [3] </ref> propose just this change at the end of their paper, saying that it should significantly improve their models statistics. (p. 295) Actually, the models of Brown et al. [3] already include certain simple morphological transformations: We have restored the e to the end of qu and have ... analyzed des <p> Brown et al. <ref> [3] </ref> propose just this change at the end of their paper, saying that it should significantly improve their models statistics.

Brown et al. <ref> [3] </ref> suggest replacing the inected variants of a verb with its canonical form plus an abstract feature (which they call an ending), indicating its person, number and tense values in a given sentence. <p> Conclusion There is an obvious objection that may be raised regarding our attempt to quantify and analyse word alignment errors produced by a system like TM-Align: Why bother? If, in response to the inadequacies of Model 2, Brown et al. <ref> [3] </ref> have developed Models 3, 4 and 5, why not perform our tests on an implementation of these more powerful models? There are a number of answers to this objection.

Reference-contexts: Keeping this kind of difficulty in mind, we will now examine recent work in the area of text alignment. 2.3 Recent Progress 2.3.1 Character Alignment As a more robust alternative to sentence-level alignment, Church <ref> [4] </ref> proposes a method for aligning text based on character matches within source and target texts. Following Simard et al. [14], this method makes use of an operational definition of cognates to hypothesize links between the texts.

Reference-contexts: All the models outlined above require aligned sentences as input. An alternative word alignment program is proposed by Dagan et al. <ref> [5] </ref>, in which the input is instead a rough global alignment of the two texts (the output of char_align), and the program used is an adapted version of Brown et al.s Model 2. <p> We therefore turn to our experiment and the issue of evaluation. 3. How well do current word alignment algorithms work? The only published quantitative evaluation of current word alignment algorithms that we are aware of is found in Dagan et al. <ref> [5] </ref>. The authors actually describe two evaluations of their word_align program. The first was conducted on a 160 000-word corpus taken from the bilingual Canadian Hansards; errors were sampled at sentence boundaries and compared with the true alignments, as established by a panel of human judges. <p> LL Les accusations en question ne s appuient sur rien de concret . ???? French words in the sample are summarized in Table 1 below. 6 Perhaps the first thing to notice about these results is that they are significantly better than those cited from Dagan et al. <ref> [5] </ref>: they report an error rate of 39.5% for a 300-word sample which does not include any function words. 7 The overall error rate in our sample is 32%, and this drops to 22% when function words are excluded. Several factors have probably contributed to produce this difference. <p> For another, there is the fact that the more powerful models are also computationally more costly. Perhaps this is why Dagan et al. <ref> [5] </ref> base their own word_align program on Model 2. In any case, our intention was not to prove that systems like TM-Align are not up to the task of expressing the full range of translation correspondences that may be found in two texts; we knew this beforehand.

Reference-contexts: Despite this obvious limitation, several useful applications for sentence-level alignments have been found, including bilingual terminology research (Dagan et al. <ref> [6] </ref>) and novel translators aids such as TransSearch, a bilingual concordancing tool (Isabelle et al. [10]), and TransCheck, a tool for automatically detecting certain types of translation errors (Macklovitch [12]). The problems of sentence-level alignment, if not entirely resolved, are fairly well understood. <p> On the contrary, we contend that current word alignment algorithms, if applied judiciously to well-defined sub-tasks in translation, already allow for exciting new types of translation support tools. We will conclude by briey illustrating with two examples. The Termight system described in Dagan & Church <ref> [6] </ref> is designed to assist translators and lexicographers in building glossaries from previously translated texts. It extracts candidate terms from the source text, which are reviewed and confirmed by a terminologist in an interactive session.

Reference-contexts: Another word-based refinement method, in which the preferred sentence alignment is the one that maximizes the number of systematic word correspondences, is proposed by Kay and Roscheisen [11]. Debili and Sammouda <ref> [7] </ref> build on this method by using a bilingual dictionary to guide the initial hypotheses on word correspondences, thereby reducing the algorithms search space. <p> The problems of sentence-level alignment, if not entirely resolved, are fairly well understood. What about translation correspondences below the sentence level? As Debili and Sammouda <ref> [7] </ref> point out, as we descend the text hierarchy, from chapter to section, section to paragraph, paragraph to sentence, sentence to word and word to character, there seems to be a breaking point at the level of the sentence.

Reference-contexts: However, the term alignment can also refer to research efforts into finding practical methods for obtaining such aligned texts. The product of an alignment at the level of the entire text is also known as a bi-text. Harris <ref> [9] </ref> is credited with coining this term to designate the juxtaposition of a translations source and target texts on the same page or screen, in a way that can be stored for future consultation. <p> The idea was to construct a bilingual concordance by having a data operator manually input the text and its translation, thus creating a valuable reference tool for translators. Harris discussion <ref> [9] </ref> of the uses for bi-text is motivated by the same desire to capitalize on existing resources.

Translation Analysis 2.1 Definition of Terms and Concepts The term translation analysis, introduced by Isabelle et al. <ref> [10] </ref>, can be defined as a set of techniques for automatically reconstructing the correspondences between segments of a source text and the segments of its translation. <p> Despite this obvious limitation, several useful applications for sentence-level alignments have been found, including bilingual terminology research (Dagan et al. [6]) and novel translators aids such as TransSearch, a bilingual concordancing tool (Isabelle et al. <ref> [10] </ref>), and TransCheck, a tool for automatically detecting certain types of translation errors (Macklovitch [12]).

Reference-contexts: subsection, we will give a brief overview of the history of text alignment, beginning with the first proposals for recycling past translations. 2.2 Brief History of Alignment The idea of electronically storing past translations in a bilingual format in the hopes of reusing their contents was first proposed by Melby <ref> [13] </ref>. The idea was to construct a bilingual concordance by having a data operator manually input the text and its translation, thus creating a valuable reference tool for translators. Harris discussion [9] of the uses for bi-text is motivated by the same desire to capitalize on existing resources.

Reference-contexts: Used alone, length-based alignment algorithms are therefore neither very robust nor reliable. Ensuing work in sentence alignment suggested various ways of dealing with these robustness and reliability issues. Simard et al. <ref> [14] </ref> propose a method for coupling the length criterion with the notion of cognateness 2 to boost the algorithms performance. Another word-based refinement method, in which the preferred sentence alignment is the one that maximizes the number of systematic word correspondences, is proposed by Kay and Roscheisen [11]. <p> Following Simard et al. <ref> [14] </ref>, this method makes use of an operational definition of cognates to hypothesize links between the texts. Its basic assumption is that cognates of words in the immediate vicinity of a given word x will be found among the words in the vicinity of its translation f (x). <p> Cognates are pairs of words in different languages which, usually due to a common etymology, share phonological or orthographic properties as well as semantic properties, so that they are often employed as mutual translations.

Reference-contexts: This process of analysis in turn facilitates the development of new kinds of automatic translation aids. The concept of alignment is more difficult to pin down. It has been used to designate both a process and the result of that process. According to the Collins Cobuild dictionary <ref> [15] </ref>, if you align something, you place it in a certain position in relation to something else, usually along a particular line or parallel to it.
