Abstract: A study is made of a non-smooth matrix optimization problem arising in adaptive-optics, which involves the optimal real-time control of a very fast-acting deformable mirror designed to compensate for atmospheric turbulence and other image degradation factors, such as wind-induced telescope vibration (windshake). The surface shape of this mirror must change rapidly to correct for time-varying optical distortions caused by these sources of image degradation. One formulation of this problem yields a functional f (U ) = P n i=1 max j f(U T M j U ) ii g over orthogonal matrices U , where U defines the basis of de-formable mirror control modes to be used, and the collection of nfin symmetric matrices M j characterize adaptive-optics performance over multiple control bandwidths. Selecting the orthogonal matrix U which maximizes f (U ) corresponds to defining a basis of deformable mirror control modes and their associated control bandwidths. We consider first the situation which can arise in practical applications where the matrices M j are "nearly" pairwise commutative. Besides providing useful bounds, these results lead to a simple corollary providing a closed-form solution for maximizing f in the special case where M j are simultaneously diagonalizable. The general optimization problem is approached using a heuristic Jacobi-like algorithm, and results in a previous paper on this approach by the authors are extended. Numerical tests using the algorithm indicate that in the presence of windshake, the performance of a closed-loop adaptive-optics system can be improved by the selection of distinct and independently optimized control bandwidths for separate modes of the wave-front distortion profile. These results may be relevant for the adaptive-optics system planned for the 8-meter Gemini-North telescope to be located on the mountain of Mauna

Reference-contexts: A comprehensive study of numerical methods for simultaneous diagonalization of matrix pairs is given in <ref> [3] </ref>. There, a Jacobi-like algorithm is developed for simultaneous diagonalization of commuting pairs of complex normal matrices by orthogonal similarity transformations, using a sequence of similarity transformations by rotations to drive the off-diagonal entries to zero. The algorithm is shown to have asymptotic quadratic convergence and to be numerically stable [3]. <p> <ref> [3] </ref>. There, a Jacobi-like algorithm is developed for simultaneous diagonalization of commuting pairs of complex normal matrices by orthogonal similarity transformations, using a sequence of similarity transformations by rotations to drive the off-diagonal entries to zero. The algorithm is shown to have asymptotic quadratic convergence and to be numerically stable [3]. 4 General Case Corollary 1 shows that the functional f (U ) in equation (1) has a global maximum value whenever the matrices M j are simultaneously diagonalizable. This result holds in general. <p> In view of Theorem 1, one obvious approach for approximating a maximizer U for the general case would be to apply an extension of the simultaneous diagonalization of matrix pairs algorithm, e.g. the algorithm in <ref> [3] </ref>, to the M 1 ; : : : ; M k , until the transformed matrices are "close to" diagonal. <p> by a quantity such as off (M 1 ; : : : ; M k ) = i&lt;j ij + + i&lt;j ij : But the simultaneous diagonalization of more than two matrices is not an easy task to formulate algorithmically, and any such scheme would be very computationally intensive <ref> [3] </ref>. We have not implemented this approximate simultaneous diagonalization type of approach. Rather we choose a faster heuristic scheme described in the following sections, which appears to perform quite well on practical adaptive optics problems. The general multiple bandwidth (MB) matrix optimization problem is considered next.

In [8] the authors described a technique for improving the performance of a modal adaptive optics control system by simultaneously optimizing both the basis of wave front control modes and their associated multiple control bandwidths, which we call the multiple bandwidth (MB) approach. <p> A special case of this technique yields a control system employing only a single bandwidth on a reduced range of the possible deformable mirror degrees of freedom, which we call the single bandwidth (SB) approach. For the tests reported in <ref> [8] </ref>, the two approaches yielded nearly identical performance improvements relative to an adaptive optics control system using a single control bandwidth for all observable deformable mirror degrees of freedom with an optimized wave front reconstruction algorithm. <p> The multiple bandwidth (MB) matrix optimization problem, as formulated in <ref> [8] </ref>, reduces to the functional (1) defined above. The matrix U defines the basis of orthonormal control modes to be used, and the symmetric matrix M j characterizes adaptive-optics performance when all deformable mirror degrees of freedom are controlled at a common bandwidth ! j [7, 8]. <p> The matrix U defines the basis of orthonormal control modes to be used, and the symmetric matrix M j characterizes adaptive-optics performance when all deformable mirror degrees of freedom are controlled at a common bandwidth ! j <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. Finding an orthogonal matrix U which maximizes f (U ) corresponds to defining a basis of deformable mirror control modes and their associated control bandwidths. The deformable mirror control modes are given by the columns of the matrix U . <p> Mode number i is controlled at bandwidth ! k precisely when (U T M k U ) ii = max j (U T M j U ) ii . A detailed development of this adaptive-optics multiple bandwidth control model can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. 3 The Nearly Diagonalizable Case For computational convenience, we restrict our attention to the case of real n fi n matrices M j and orthogonal U . <p> As indicated earlier, finding an orthogonal matrix U which maximizes f (U ) in (1) corresponds to defining a basis of deformable mirror control modes and their associated control bandwidths. It has been observed in practical data <ref> [8] </ref>, that the M j in (1) are nearly diagonal matrices, and thus, of course, are almost simultaneously diagonalizable. The computations reported in [8] were performed with such data. Below is given a bound that sheds light on this situation and clarifies 5 some observations reported in that paper. <p> It has been observed in practical data <ref> [8] </ref>, that the M j in (1) are nearly diagonal matrices, and thus, of course, are almost simultaneously diagonalizable. The computations reported in [8] were performed with such data. Below is given a bound that sheds light on this situation and clarifies 5 some observations reported in that paper. <p> We say that the fM j g form a "nearly optimal" set of mirror matrices if n X max f (M j ) ii g is close to f max . It was conjectured by the authors <ref> [8] </ref> that f in (1) is maximized by a particular orthogonal matrix Q in the special case where the M j are simultaneously diagonalized by Q. We now formally state and prove this result, which also includes the single-bandwidth reduced-range deformable mirror control case considered in [8] as a consequence. <p> conjectured by the authors <ref> [8] </ref> that f in (1) is maximized by a particular orthogonal matrix Q in the special case where the M j are simultaneously diagonalized by Q. We now formally state and prove this result, which also includes the single-bandwidth reduced-range deformable mirror control case considered in [8] as a consequence. Theorem 1 Suppose fM j g, 1 j k, is a collection of n-by-n symmetric matrices. <p> Therefore a value of U which actually maximizes f (U ) always exists. This matrix U is not necessarily unique. 8 However, any U maximizing (1) yields an optimal solution to the deformable mirror control problem considered in <ref> [8] </ref>. In this section we approach the general problem of maximizing f (U ), where the M j are not necessarily simultaneously diagonalizable. <p> The algorithm terminates when the sequence ff (U (j) )g converges. The work requirements in using this algorithm are O (kn 3 ) operations per sweep. Our experience on some practical adaptive optics problems reported on <ref> [8] </ref>, and in x5 of this paper, is that only a few sweeps are necessary for convergence. We can avoid the use of temporary storage for the set of matrices B by directly updating the matrices M and U . <p> = 2 where 2 0 is the "open loop" mean-square phase error due to turbulence and windshake effects with no adaptive optics at all. f (U ) is the value found using either the single bandwidth reduced range algorithm (SB) or the multiple bandwidth control algorithm (MB), as described in <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. For most of the cases we have considered, f (U ) is quite close to 2 0 , so even a small change in f (U ) can make a big (relative) difference to the residual error 2 . <p> The phase variance due to windshake is entirely due to the tip and tilt modes, while the turbulence-induced error is distributed across the entire range of spatial frequencies. In order to produce a consistent comparison with the tests we reported in <ref> [8] </ref>, our new tests are again made with eighteen control bandwidths, including one at infinity. The mirror matrices M j for these control bandwidths are again chosen to be 76 fi 76, the size determined by the number of continuous facesheet deformable mirror actuators. <p> The adaptive optics Strehl ratio [12, 22] is approximately equal to exp ( 2 ), so variations of 2 on the order of 0.1 to 0.2 are practically very significant. Here are some preliminary observations from the results reported in the tables: * As reported in <ref> [8] </ref>, the performance difference between the SB and MB algorithms is not large enough to be of practical significance when windshake is neglected (see Table 2). * Including windshake significantly degrades the performance of the SB algorithm (see Figures 2 and 3). <p> This paper extends earlier work on an optimization method from <ref> [8] </ref> for the real-time control of deformable mirrors with the use of multiple bandwidths for adaptive-optics applications.

Reference-contexts: To be effective, these corrections have to be performed at real-time speed. Adaptive-optics control systems form the subject of considerable recent investigation, see, e.g. <ref> [7, 8, 24] </ref>. An algorithm for optimizing the real-time control of a very fast-acting deformable mirror designed for atmospheric turbulence compensation is an application of interest in this paper. In some situations, wind-induced telescope vibration (windshake) must also be compensated as the image is initially acquired.
