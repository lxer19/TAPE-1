Reference-contexts: In an attempt to make some progress on the problem, it is natural to look for long cycles in order to obtain at least a good lower bound on the length of the longest cycle in the middle two levels graph. As a starting point, a result of Babai <ref> [1] </ref> on vertex transitive graphs establishes that there is a cycle of length at least (3N ) 1=2 , where N is the total number of vertices in the middle two levels.

Reference-contexts: Since the first and last elements of L n also differ in one bit position, the code is in fact a cycle. It can be implemented efficiently in the sense that successive elements can be generated in worst case constant time <ref> [2] </ref>. In practice, Gray codes with certain additional properties may be desirable (see [8] for a survey).

Reference-contexts: One reason that the middle levels graph has attracted so much attention is that it belongs to this class; thus, either it has a hamilton path, or it provides a negative answer to the question of Lovasz.

Reference-contexts: Recently, Felsner and Trotter have shown that G 2k+1 (k) has a cycle of length at least one-fourth the length of a hamilton cycle, giving the first constant factor approximation <ref> [6] </ref>; we show in Section 3 that monotone Gray codes do even better, yielding paths of more than half the 5 ; 1,2 2,3 1,3 3,4 1,4 2,4 4,5 2,5 3; 5 1; 5 1,2,3,4 2,3,4,5 1,3,4,5 1,2,4,5 1,2,3,5 1. length of a hamilton cycle. <p> In [16] a technique was presented for constructing a cycle of length at least N :836 , and then in a recent breakthrough, Felsner and Trotter <ref> [6] </ref> showed how to construct cycles of length at least .25N , giving the first constant factor approximation. 13 In this section, we show that our monotone Gray code already provides a path of length .5N ; in Section 5 we use another construction to make a further improvement. <p> Concluding Remarks We mention an open problem related to monotone Gray codes, due to Felsner and Trotter. As in <ref> [6] </ref>, define an ffsequence for B n to be a sequence C 1 ; : : : ; C h of subsets of [n] satisfying C j 6ae C i1 [ C i for 1 &lt; i &lt; j h: It is shown in [6] that an ffsequence for B n <p> As in <ref> [6] </ref>, define an ffsequence for B n to be a sequence C 1 ; : : : ; C h of subsets of [n] satisfying C j 6ae C i1 [ C i for 1 &lt; i &lt; j h: It is shown in [6] that an ffsequence for B n can have length at most 2 n1 + b (n + 1)=2c. <p> This result is used in <ref> [6] </ref> to establish a lower bound of 1 + dlog 2 (ht (I))e on the chromatic number of the diagram of any interval order, I.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction An n-bit binary Gray code is an enumeration of all n-bit strings so that successive elements differ in one bit position. In 1953, Frank Gray patented a simple and efficient scheme to generate a binary Gray code for any value of n <ref> [7, 9] </ref>. His scheme, now called the "binary reflected Gray code," can be defined recursively as follows.

Reference-contexts: It can be implemented efficiently in the sense that successive elements can be generated in worst case constant time [2]. In practice, Gray codes with certain additional properties may be desirable (see <ref> [8] </ref> for a survey). For example, note that as the elements of L n are scanned, the lowest order (rightmost) bit changes 2 n1 times, whereas the highest order bit changes only twice, counting the return to the first element. <p> Only in the case where n is a power of two is a balanced Gray code known to exist [18]. In other applications, the requirement is to maximize the shortest maximal consecutive sequence of zeroes (or ones) among all bit positions <ref> [8] </ref>. Here we consider a new constraint. Define the weight of a binary string to be the number of 1's in the string.

Reference-contexts: In the opposite direction, dilation of any embedding of the hypercube into the array is (2 n = p n); in fact, Harper <ref> [10] </ref> shows that the precise minimum dilation (called the "bandwidth" of the hypercube) is n1 X bj=2c : This dilation is achievable by embedding level-by-level, ordering lexicographically within each level; but like any level-by-level embedding its inverse has dilation (n).

Reference-contexts: The problem sounds simple, but has resisted the efforts of many researchers. The largest value of k for which a hamilton cycle is known to exist is k = 11 (attributed to David Moews and Mike Reid [14]). Lovasz <ref> [13] </ref> has asked whether every connected, vertex transitive graph has a hamilton path.
