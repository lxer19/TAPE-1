Title: Reconstruction of Metabolic Networks Using Incomplete Information  
Author: by Terry Gaasterland and Evgeni Selkov 
Abstract: This paper describes an approach that uses methods for automated sequence analysis [GLMC94] and multiple databases accessed through an object+attribute view of the data [BDG + 92], together with metabolic pathways, reaction equations, and compounds parsed into a logical representation from the Enzyme and Metabolic Pathway Database [SYet.al.94], as the sources of data for automatically reconstructing a weighted partial metabolic network for a prokaryotic organism. Additional information can be provided interactively by the expert user to guide reconstruction.

Reference-contexts: Automatic Sequence Analysis The AutoSeq automatic sequence analysis system is composed of three separate modules. The first is a data collection module that accepts DNA sequence, sends it out to an array of analysis tools (including blastx, blastn, tblastn, blaize, fasta, genmark, and blocks <ref> [AGM + 90, HH93, CC90] </ref>), and parses the output into prolog facts. Each input sequence has a unique identifier. Each fact gleaned about a sequence expresses a property about some range within the sequence.

Reference-contexts: Also needed is an environment for answering queries about individual sequences, phylo-genetically related organisms, and sets of sequences interrelated by homology. The GenoBase integrated database system <ref> [BDG + 92, YSK + 92] </ref> provides this environment. It treats each body of data as a set of objects with attributes. Each object-attribute structure is encoded as one or more Prolog facts. Prolog rules capture operators over the objects.

Reference-contexts: The work has unfolded in close concert with the manual reconstruction of the metabolism of Mycoplasma capricolum by domain experts with the intention of building a tool that will work rapidly and reliably for procaryotic organisms, in particular for archaea <ref> [Doo92] </ref>. One critical component for carrying out reconstruction of metabolism from genome sequence data is a system that produces a ranked list of potential proteins that appear in the sequence data. The AutoSeq system at Argonne [GL94, GLMC94] provides this facility.

Reference-contexts: All of these pentoses are very common in the host of M. capricolum (the gut of a goat), so we can postulate that M. capricolum takes advantage of it. Finally, we reason forward through connectivity that D-xylulose-5-phosphate enters the glycolytic system via the truncated hexose-monophosphate shunt <ref> [DTP89] </ref>. There is strong direct evidence for transketylase, 2.2.1.1, which takes D-xylulose-5-phosphate to D-fructose-6-phosphate, which like carbamoyl phosphate leads us into the glycolytic system. 7 Figure 4 shows the reconstruction. Our third example carries the unfolding pathway topology in the direction of energy metabolism.

Reference-contexts: The distance between organisms is the sum of their distances to their closest common ancestor. Thus, the phylogenetic tree provides a measurement of proximity between organisms for use in query relaxation <ref> [GGM92] </ref>. 3 Reconstruction from Direct Sequence Evidence The problem of reconstructing metabolism automatically for an organism can be partitioned into a series of reasoning steps. The starting point is a list of proteins in the organism for which there is evidence.

Reference-contexts: We reason about arginine biosynthesis as follows. We have weak genome sequence evidence for the enzyme that catalyzes arginine hydrolysis, 3.5.3.6. We have strong evidence for 2.1.3.3, ornithine carbomoyl transferase. The literature tells us that arginine hydrolysis occurs in several Mycoplasma strains <ref> [Pol86] </ref>. So from the putative enzymes 3.5.3.6 and 2.1.3.3, we infer that the pathway between arginine and L-ornithine is present. Through connectivity and default reasoning, we suppose that carbamoyl phosphate is taken to CO 2 by enzyme 2.7.2.2.
