Abstract: Wireless networking is becoming an increasingly important communication means, yet high wide-area wireless data connectivity is difficult to achieve due to technological and physical limitations. To alleviate these problems we experiment with an alternative by placing many high bandwidth local "islands" of info-stations dispersed throughout the low bandwidth wide-area wireless network. The location and distribution of the individual stations is crucial for the network's overall effectiveness, as demonstrated by our investigations. The info-stations are deployed in a transparent manner, often not geographically visible to the user. Applications must be designed mobile-aware and able to account for changing network characteristics by optimally utilizing the available network resources. We simulate alternative network layouts and determine their effectiveness by experimenting with an incremental map downloading application for road travelers that uses intelligent prefetching to take advantage of the info-stations. The prefetching algorithm uses location, route and speed information to predict future data access. Our experiments show substantial performance improvement of the mobile-aware application in the info-station network over a mobile-unaware application in a conventional wide-area wireless network. The prefetching algorithm proves to hide latency from the user better than a mobile-unaware prefetching algorithm. The results also suggest that a network design with frequent short range info-stations is better than one with fewer, longer range stations.

Reference-contexts: To hide latency and improve availability of the data at the client site, we design the application to be aware of the high bandwidth info-station links and use intelligent prefetching techniques. Since the data transferred to the client is large, a dissemination based approach <ref> [AFZ96] </ref> would not be feasible. Using permanent storage, such as CD-ROM or hard disk, is also nonoptimal because, (1) thin clients are desirable; (2) data on CD-ROM is not updated easily, therefore time dependent information related to location, such as traffic information and whether updates, cannot not be included.

Reference-contexts: In later sections we demonstrate the benefits of such application-network coupling over an application that is unaware of the network bandwidth variation. It is possible that such coupling could happen in the network layer, as suggested in <ref> [Bad96] </ref>, but we leave that as a future network layer design option. Mechanisms for notifying the application of network variation, such as high bandwidth availability, are discussed in [BW96]. 3 Modeling the mobile environment We simulate the Map-on-the-Move application and the network of info-stations.

Reference-contexts: In [Fra97], the conceptual design of an Infostation, its impact on future PCS, and the potential differences in design of the OSI layers, as required by mobile versus stationary clients, is briefly sketched. No attribute to mobile-awareness within the application design is given. Badrinath, <ref> [Bad97] </ref>, first proposed the theory of supporting users with information services, such as, e-mail, fax, and web access offered by 'infostations' as pocket of high bandwidth areas along the highway, at traffic lights or airport entrances. we aim at hiding user perceived latency through network aware application design. <p> Infostations, as discussed by Frenkeil et al. have first been mentioned by Imielin-ski [Imi96] in a DataMan project perspective. The idea of placing info-stations, "pockets of high bit rate connectivity", in a wireless network to enhance connectivity was first presented by Badrinath in <ref> [Bad97] </ref>. Badri-nath, however, aims more at supporting stationary "information kiosks", where mobile users can download e-mail, fax, news and local information.

Reference-contexts: Techniques referred to as stashing and hoarding are used in mobile computing environments [KS92] and <ref> [TLAC95] </ref>. These approaches are very similar to prefetching. Their focus is more on improving availability of the data in the system as opposed to directly influencing performance gain.

Reference-contexts: Such a network configuration provides high bandwidth, but not uniformly. Combined with a network-aware application design, it could benefit a large class of non-latency sensitive applications. Examples include interactive map querying, e-mail retrieval, and web browsing, et cetera. A related approach has first been pioneered by Take et al., <ref> [TMOIT94b, TMOIT94a] </ref>, who proposed and studied a network system based on 'chained isolated radio zones' located along a road to enable non-real-time media services for moving vehicles. <p> The benchmark results show small but frequent info-station coverage is more favored. 5 Related Work The idea to deploy "information islands" along roads to enable wireless communication for driving vehicles has first been studied by Take et al. <ref> [TMOIT94b, TMOIT94a] </ref>. They propose a mobile packet communication system based on chained isolated microradio zones and study the relationship between the time a vehicle spends in a radio zone and the achievable throughput.

Reference-contexts: Prefetching has been widely studied and applied to improve system performance in different areas ranging from software system design to hardware design, e.g., in database systems [Sto81], operating systems [PGS93], in language compilers <ref> [Tri79] </ref>, and microprocessors design [CB92] have prefetching techniques been successfully employed. Techniques referred to as stashing and hoarding are used in mobile computing environments [KS92] and [TLAC95]. These approaches are very similar to prefetching.

Reference-contexts: Some work on event signaling [BW96], has already been done to support this kind of mobile awareness. Watson, <ref> [Wat94] </ref>, summarizes several design techniques helpful for mobile application design. Snoop TCP [BSAK95] and indirect TCP [BB95] propose transport layer protocol improvement for wireless networks. Fox et al., [FGBA96], showed how proxy support can be used in wireless networks.

Reference-contexts: The microcell network, Ricochet [Met95], by Met-ricom Inc., provides up to 30kbps bandwidth, but it does not support that under vehicular speeds. Emerging, third generation networks, investigated in Eu-rope under the umbrella term UMTS (Universal Mobile Telephone Services) aim at supporting up to 2 Mbps services on mobile links <ref> [XII96, KLO97, BGR + 98, O'M98] </ref>. Mobile services for the use in and the control of high-speed trains are projects currently pursued [ICG + 97].

Reference-contexts: We also focus on supporting highly mobile users, such as driving vehicles, with non-real-time media services by placing info-stations transparently to the user, By constructing info-stations along major highways we can enable such applications for highly mobile users, which is currently not possible, as initially demonstrated in <ref> [YJK97] </ref>, Most of today's applications are not designed network aware. For the class of applications we are targeting network awareness refers to the need to establish a connection between the changing network availability of info-stations, the user interactions, and the application design.
