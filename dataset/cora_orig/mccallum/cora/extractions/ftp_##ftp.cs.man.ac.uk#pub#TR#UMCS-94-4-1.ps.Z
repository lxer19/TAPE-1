Reference-contexts: Whereas human beings were able to react to such inconsistent views of the company's operation, their electronic counterparts could not. In fact, more than one corporation failed in its first attempts to develop integrated information systems.

Reference-contexts: Nonetheless, there are clear signs that researchers (both implementers and users) are beginning to view this system as an information resource, as exemplified by some of the articles in the August 1994 issue of the Communications of the ACM on `Internet Technology'. In particular, the paper on `Resource Discovery' <ref> [BDMS94] </ref> describes situations similar to those expected in the GyP R Access paths must be planned, with a view to both performing computation where it can be undertaken most efficiently and to avoiding the transfer of huge volumes of data over expensive networks where most of the data will simply be

Reference-contexts: Even though this example involves a considerable amount of processing (in the simulation), it is still, from the user's point of view, a matter of first compiling the necessary input information and then accessing the formatted results. Another motivation is provided by Vannevar Bush's <ref> [Bus67] </ref> picture of the scientist's desk: `Memex', which clearly recognises the importance of connections between items of information. <p> Huberman's book [Hub88] `The Ecology of Computation' has chapters on `Agoric Systems', `Deals among Agents' and `Market-like Task Schedulers' which all relate to this topic. 5 5 As a frustrating example of difficulty in accessing information, <ref> [Bus67, Hub88, Ken78] </ref> are all out-of-print and two of these had to be obtained by the time-consuming `Inter-Library Loan' process. 14 Some interesting effects emerge when the concepts of compiling and accessing of information are applied to distributed networks themselves (i.e., the subject of a database is the structure and operation

Reference-contexts: Indeed, this simple entity-relation view is one way of designing closed information systems (see, for example, [RBP + 91] or <ref> [CAB + 94] </ref> for a description of its use in `OMT' or `Fusion', respectively). Relational databases cement this view as a way of storing and accessing information.

Reference-contexts: It is quite probable that the early state had to be endured in order to overcome the specific problems then being encountered. Perhaps the penultimate word can be left to Keith Devlin <ref> [Dev91] </ref> who writes: That there is such a thing as information cannot be disputed, can it? After all, our very lives depend upon it, upon its gathering, storage, manipulation, transmission, security and so on.

Reference-contexts: This interview also echoes our view that progress in this kind of endeavour relies on integrated application of multiple technical approaches. Distributed AI and Cooperative Distributed Problem Solving <ref> [DLC89] </ref> are developments of this topic that seem pertinent to the GyP R IS Challenge.

Reference-contexts: The state of the art in this area is captured pertinently in the July 1994 issue of the Communications of the ACM, on `Intelligent Agents'. A paper in that issue on the Cyc system <ref> [GL94] </ref> contemplates potential applications that are highly relevant to our quest, and the Editor's interview with Marvin Minsky [Rie94] throws useful light on the practical barriers to be overcome in future research.

Reference-contexts: The GyP IS Challenge adds a new dimension to this problem in that it is necessary to access information from many different sources. The discussion of `Open Systems' in <ref> [HdJ84] </ref> and the recently proposed concept of `Megaprogramming' [WWC92] seem to begin to address this need.

Reference-contexts: Some databases nowadays can be accessed via a `natural language' interface, and there have been several attempts to provide adaptive database interfaces (e.g. <ref> [HK91] </ref>), although the degree of adaptability is very limited when compared with human behaviour. Attempts to mimic the adaptability of `real' human behaviour have foundered so far on issues such as consciousness and common sense.

Reference-contexts: the entire Human Genome Initiative is redolent with information-oriented challenges that have a considerable amount in common with the themes of this paper [Fre91]. 13 being developed for support of `multi-agent' computing, and there is interest in the creation of `societies' of such computational entities (see, also, the comments on <ref> [Hub88] </ref> in section 3.4). Of course, it is tempting to believe that achievement of `strong AI' would offer a way of overcoming all of the problems in the GyP R IS Challenge. <p> This has obvious resonance with the design of cache memory systems for massively parallel computer systems (see [Tok90] for an interesting view on this).

Reference-contexts: This is exactly what goes wrong when it is falsely recorded that somebody has died: the relation in the information system no longer corresponds to the perceived reality. Michael Jackson <ref> [Jac83] </ref> proposes an approach to designing information systems where the physical world is first understood and then appropriate methods are designed to link changes to its abstract representation in our computer system to events in the physical world.

Reference-contexts: presumably possible that they might avoid having to pay tax)! The problems of keeping the abstractions inside a computer in step with the reality of the world about which they are supposed to record information are enormous and often revolve around issues of uniquely identifying objects which are reviewed in <ref> [Ken78] </ref>. While writing this article there was a newspaper report that the UK Driver Vehicle Licencing Agency had been investigated by the National Audit Office and it was found that one third of the records about drivers and one quarter of the information about vehicles contained errors. <p> However, the development of `better' database technologies is not of itself going to solve all the GyP IS problems. As articulated so clearly by William Kent <ref> [Ken78] </ref>, it is always going to be necessary to view data from some unanticipated angle in order to maintain compatibility with the human view of the information it represents: there is no all-pervading, `best' view. <p> Huberman's book [Hub88] `The Ecology of Computation' has chapters on `Agoric Systems', `Deals among Agents' and `Market-like Task Schedulers' which all relate to this topic. 5 5 As a frustrating example of difficulty in accessing information, <ref> [Bus67, Hub88, Ken78] </ref> are all out-of-print and two of these had to be obtained by the time-consuming `Inter-Library Loan' process. 14 Some interesting effects emerge when the concepts of compiling and accessing of information are applied to distributed networks themselves (i.e., the subject of a database is the structure and operation

Reference-contexts: As has been observed by Manny Lehman <ref> [LB85] </ref>, the presence of an information system changes the environment and effectively guarantees that the users' requirements will change. For example, consider the way the world has changed now that we can use our `Switch' (Electronic Funds Transfer) card in the supermarket.

Reference-contexts: Time and again we have seen cases where access to the right information at the right time saves lives, creates wealth, improves the environment, etc., etc. The contribution made by Gutenburg to the dissemination of information is discussed in the seminal work of Marshall McLuhan <ref> [McL62] </ref>. The exponential progress in science, technology and engineering would have been impossible without our ability to disseminate technical information. Today's computing and communications technology can support an enormous growth in information access, inducing who knows what changes in our society.

Reference-contexts: Everyone can benefit from access to multiple sources of computer-based data, suitably interpreted as the human-related information it represents. Such information would be even more useful if it could be integrated in a reasonable way <ref> [MGT + 87] </ref>. However, there are severe technical problems standing in the way of this ideal.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, this simple entity-relation view is one way of designing closed information systems (see, for example, <ref> [RBP + 91] </ref> or [CAB + 94] for a description of its use in `OMT' or `Fusion', respectively).

Reference-contexts: As each need was identified, so a new system was developed to `satisfice' <ref> [Sim69] </ref> it. It was not long before senior management realised that this multiplicity of different computer systems was not only inefficient but that it was leading 9 to new sorts of `clerical' problems which had not been encountered in the manual information processing age.

Reference-contexts: In moving on, it is desirable to have the same kind of theoretical underpinning as was present with abstract data types for the new concepts which are to be used in future systems. One natural extension of the abstract data type theme is found in object-oriented concepts (notably <ref> [Tok93] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The dangers of `Wire Pirates' are discussed in <ref> [Wal94] </ref>. On the social front, the displacement of human advisers by computational activities, plus the emergence of jobs in the new information service `industry', will precipitate yet another round of `reskilling' of the workforce.
