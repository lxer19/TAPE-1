Abstract: Let T (n) denote the number of n-simplices in a minimum cardinality decomposition of the n-cube into n-simplices. For n 1 we show that T (n) H(n), where H(n) is the ratio of the 2 6 n=2 (n + 1) n+1 Also lim n!1 p n[H(n)] 1=n 0:9281. Explicit bounds for T (n) are tabulated for n 10, and we mention some other results on hyperbolic volumes. hyperbolic volume of the ideal cube to the ideal regular simplex. H(n) 1
