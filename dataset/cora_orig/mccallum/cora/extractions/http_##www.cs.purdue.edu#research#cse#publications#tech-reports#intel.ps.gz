Reference-contexts: The amount of communication is reduced by a combination of caching, profiling, proxied access, delayed writes and loose reads. Data consistency is provided by using the proxy services, a centralized data manager with callbacks and strict reads. In <ref> [9] </ref>, the authors present techniques for detecting mutual consistency between shared objects. Since objects must be cached at the client to ensure disconnected operation, it is necessary to ensure that the objects are mutually consistent. How to use the approach to support causal consistence is also described.

Reference-contexts: This architecture supports a uniform model for application activation and (event) notification. The socket-based approach makes the media/network type being used for the communication (for example, dial-up line, local docking station, infrared or wireless LAN) transparent to the application. In <ref> [10] </ref>, the authors present three algorithms for maintaining causal ordering on message delivery in mobile systems. The first algorithm handles resource constraints introduced by mobile hosts, but doe not scale well and is not graceful to host disconnections and connections. The second algorithm eliminates these problems while inhibiting some messages.

Reference-contexts: The paper presents a classification of the different degrees of non-traceability and presents a new, efficient method for alias computation. Using this technique during authentication of mobile users avoids the drawbacks of existing solutions such as GSM and CDPD. In <ref> [12] </ref>, the authors present the implementation of a pen-based database interface for a pen computer (using the PenPoint operating system) with a built in cellular phone. Using the cellular phone capabilities, the interface connects to remote databases and displays the schema information of the database chosen by the user.

Reference-contexts: The first algorithm handles resource constraints introduced by mobile hosts, but doe not scale well and is not graceful to host disconnections and connections. The second algorithm eliminates these problems while inhibiting some messages. The final algorithm is a trade-off between the first two algorithms. In <ref> [16] </ref>, the author discusses how changing communication requirements are handled in the MosquitoNet project. Their goal is to allow portable computers to move seamlessly from one communication medium to another, for example from an ethernet connection to a wireless modem, without rebooting or restarting applications.

Reference-contexts: The intent is to present individual applications with their own view of the database that is consistent with their own actions, even if they read and write from different, potentially inconsistent servers. In <ref> [17] </ref> Barbara and Imielinski present two different caching strategies in mobile environments. They envision a future where a large number of users armed with low-power palmtop machines will query databases over wireless communication channels.

Reference-contexts: A protocol is described in which the hosts themselves serve as forwarding agents and thus constitute an impromptu mobile infrastructure. The implementation of a Web browser on an Apple Newton, communicating via a low-bandwidth wireless link is described in <ref> [19] </ref>. The strategy adopted was that of partitioning applications so that the CPU-intensive processing occured on powerful servers. This was also shown to be critical to good performance. A very different approach to mobile access of the Web is described in [65].

Reference-contexts: The system uses a list of observed file references and a set of clustering algorithms to construct a plausible mapping of those references into different tasks. Hoarding is then performed on tasks rather than on individual files. A paper on teleporting, <ref> [22] </ref>, reported on experience with using a system that allows the display of an application to follow the user around as he moves, leaving program execution at the original site. This ability is especially convenient when combined with an active badge system that tracks user location.

Reference-contexts: In response to gestures made by the user, the interface automatically generates queries and retrieves results. The universal relation concept is used to aid in automatically generating queries based on the attributes chosen by the user. In <ref> [23] </ref>, the authors discuss alternative approaches to transparent resource discovery for mobile computers. They consider the mobile-IP approach to transparency (having the mobile machine have some virtual location) not acceptable as the associated latencies are location dependent.

Reference-contexts: An overview is provided for customers as well as for enterprise offering global services. Different branches are characterized in order to show the potential of commodities and services based on mobility and telecommunications. The effects of host motion on the performance of active transport-level connections is explored in <ref> [26] </ref>. Current retransmission policies are shown to introduce unacceptably long pauses in communication (800 milliseconds and longer). A fast retransmission scheme that can reduce these pauses to levels more suitable for human interaction is proposed.

Reference-contexts: Duchamp in [39] also provides a similar overview. He deals with the challenges that mobile computing poses to internetworking and service providing, amongst others, and lists the research issues that need to be addressed. Another review is provided by Caldwell <ref> [27] </ref>. His focus, however, is on how such systems will 6 reshape the way people use technology, and the manner in which ubiquity will affect managing IS needs for business and management. He also comments on the potential difficulties that will arise in mobile applications. <p> The paper talks about several existing hardware systems and their performance, and also outlines the history of technology in this area. Badrinath, Acharya and Imilienski have produced significant work in the area of mobile systems, especially on how mobility affects database like systems. In this paper <ref> [27] </ref>, they formulate a theoretical model of how distributed computations are affected by characteristics of mobile computers, such as elective disconnections and the differential cost of sending messages to mobile and static hosts. They argue that traditional distributed algorithms will not perform as well for mobile systems.

Reference-contexts: In certain cases, it was shown to be desirable to offer alternative actions to 12 the user, allowing them to make performance versus cost decisions. The use of group communication primitives for mobile computing is detailed in <ref> [30] </ref>. It was emphasized that the performance overhead of this approach is indeed acceptable. A video transport protocol for wireless networks is also presented in [76]. The novel feature of this protocol is its ability to dynamically adapt the bandwidth required to the current content of the video.

Reference-contexts: Intelligent models that address the aforementioned problems are also presented. The architectural design of ubiquitous Problem Solving Environments (UPSEs)on wireless notebook platforms supported by stationary high performance computing (HPC) servers is addressed in <ref> [38] </ref>. PSEs are being mapped onto mobile and stationary computational engines. A partial differential equation based PDE (PDELab) is extended and a proxy-based methodology is used to partition the application components across the dual (wireless and stationary) network 18 of computational units. This helps in building a distributed PSE architecture. <p> This is designed in the context of scientific computing models based on partial differential equations to permit the non-expert user to cost-effectively and easily develop software for solving complex mathematical problems. This approach can be combined with the proxy approach described in <ref> [38] </ref> to allow wirelessly connected hosts with limited compute power to access the power of networked High Performance Computing platforms. This approach also requires that the cooperation mechanism of the agents be dynamic and adaptable.

Reference-contexts: Instead of fetching data on demand, clients continuously listen to the transmissions and cache information of interest to them. This is found to be extremely valuable when the network has asymmetric bandwidth. Techniques to cope with the performance and reliability of mobile networks are focussed in <ref> [42] </ref>. The techniques spanned three areas : deferring update propagation during periods of low bandwidth, opportunistically using high bandwidth when available, and the use of an abstraction called dynamic sets to reduce network latency during search.

This is different from the approach in systems such as Coda <ref> [58] </ref> which rely on changes to both the client and the server. Rather than committing to a specific file access protocol, they support access to multiple file services. In [77], the authors present a design for supporting file access in a mobile environment.

In <ref> [84] </ref> Parmar reviews how the power management has been done traditionally in the desktop personal computers. Then he argues that the traditional methods do not work properly for the mobile computers and presents some new power management techniques to use in the portable computer designs.

Reference-contexts: When clusters are merged, strict consistency is restored. Means for providing transaction support appropriate for mobile environments are discussed in [87]. The general architecture of an information system for mobile environments is described in <ref> [85] </ref>. System support for maintaining consistency of replicated data, and for providing transaction schemas that account for the frequent but predictable disconnections, the mobility, and the vulnerability of the environment is also detailed. Reliable stream transmission in mobile computing environments is also discussed [113].

Reference-contexts: It has been recongised that many of the decision making processes involved in the above methodology are not `crisp'. Rather, they are `fuzzy'. Several recent computationally intelligent approaches have been proposed that address this situation. Ramakrishnan et.al. <ref> [90] </ref>, propose a neuro-fuzzy system that automate the class-selection problem, the first step in PYTHIA's method, that determines the class (es) to which the given PDE problem belongs.

Reference-contexts: It also reviews the technical requirements and solutions of a high-speed, wireless LAN. The state-of-the-art in Wireless LANs is discussed in [72],[53] and [45]. New Agent based WANs have been shown to presage the future of connected computing in <ref> [91] </ref>. Instead of relying on real-time, connection-oriented sessions, smart networks make extensive use of store and forward messaging transports.

Reference-contexts: They identify effective cache invalidation strategies for both sleeper and workaholic units. In [52] Guthery argues that mobile computing requires new ways of thinking about networks. He argues against switched networks and explores possibilities for switchless networks which are named EchoNets. In <ref> [92] </ref> Rekhter presents an approach to mobile internetworking that allows hosts to move around an internet in a fashion transparent to the transport layer protocols.

Reference-contexts: They propose three approaches to address these challenges: using the database query language for hoarding, 17 using dependent commits to tentatively commit transactions at the disconnected client and using the high-level semantic of objects to avoid transaction aborts. In <ref> [93] </ref>, the authors discuss a hybrid client-server and peer-to-peer model for file systems based on multi-level replication. They use the relationship between mobile computing personae and file systems to support the file system needs of mobile users. In [14], the authors describe an indoor wireless system for personalized shopping assistance.

Reference-contexts: The server maintains all the customer and store information and provides audio/visual responses to inquiries from tens to hundreds of customers in real-time over a small area wireless network. In <ref> [94] </ref>, the authors describe a method for providing identity privacy to mobile users during authentication. This work is aimed at avoiding unauthorized tracking of users' migration. The basic solution is to use aliases, which ensures non-traceability by hiding the user's real identity and also his relationship with domain authorities.

Reference-contexts: He states that though many IS managers are aware of its importance, few companies are prepared for the transition from fixed to mobile computing. He claims that a successful transition depends to a large degree on how companies handle their client-server applications. In <ref> [95] </ref>, Satyanarayanan describes the main differences between fixed and mobile computing, and how they contradict the assumptions made in current distributed systems. He details a few key features of mobile computers as: being relatively resource-poor, being more prone to loss/damage, and operating under a broader range of network conditions.

Reference-contexts: This ability is especially convenient when combined with an active badge system that tracks user location. Work at Xerox PARC on making ParcTab applications sensitive to the current physical location of the user are described in <ref> [96] </ref>. Each ParcTab was associated with a user, and that the loss of a Tab was as serious as losing a key, though some additional security could be provided via a PIN code. The privileges of a Tab could be easily revoked by killing the proxy server associated with it.

Reference-contexts: They introduce the idea of applications that are cost aware. An important feature of mobile systems is there dynamics, which change often. Thus an application needs to be aware of such dynamics. This is the subject of a paper <ref> [98] </ref> by researchers from Xerox PARC, where they describe such a scenario. Users in there scenario interact with mobile as well as stationary systems in an office environment. There work uses dynamic environment variables to allow flexible sharing of customization information and provides efficient notification of environmental changes to applications.

Reference-contexts: Their architecture is based on having a user agent manage the location information and a partially decentralized location query service. While making certain query operations somewhat expensive, this architecture gives the user primary control over their location information. In <ref> [99] </ref> Schulman considers four techno-market areas that exemplify some of the newest and best mobile computing applications: multimedia, global positioning systems, pen-based computing and personal assistants/communicators.

Reference-contexts: He argues that this well-modularized architecture provides sufficient flexibility (can be gracefully introduced to the existing infrastructure) and generality (well-suited to a wide range of applications) to implement a mobile internet. In <ref> [100] </ref> Spreitzer and Theimer present an architecture which allows them to provide location information to mobile clients in a controlled fashion. Their architecture is based on having a user agent manage the location information and a partially decentralized location query service.

Reference-contexts: Then they propose a new service to support shared libraries in mobile environments and discuss the integration of this service into a wider architecture of reactive services being developed to support distributed mobile computing. In <ref> [102, 101] </ref> Spreitzer and Theimer discuss the necessity of providing and using of user location information in a mobile and wireless computing environment and the corresponding security and privacy threats of revealing such information to unauthorized agents.

Conf. on Parallel and Distributed Information Systems, </booktitle> <year> 1994. </year>
Reference-contexts: They argue that given that PDAs will be used largely for interacting with external services and devices (rather than as computing devices themselves), the operating systems for them must also be different from today's computing devices' operating systems. In <ref> [103] </ref> the authors present four per-session guarantee strategies for users and applications of weakly consistent replicated data.

Reference-contexts: They are also developing technology that will allow simultaneous transmission of separate multimedia information to specific users in confined areas. Novel interfaces, based on pen and voice, are also being developed. In <ref> [104] </ref> the authors present their views of what operating systems for PDA type devices will be like.

Reference-contexts: The authors also note the key product features that were found to be productive and user-friendly during these experiments. In <ref> [105] </ref>, Vecchione claims that in many corporate environments, the management of mobile computing resources is an issue that has not been dealt with clearly. He states that though many IS managers are aware of its importance, few companies are prepared for the transition from fixed to mobile computing.

Reference-contexts: Each mobile unit is represented by an agent or a proxy which resides at a well-known location. It is the responsibility of the agent to track the mobile unit as it moves from cell to cell and to deliver messages to the mobile unit. In <ref> [106] </ref> the authors describe a mobile computing environment that provides migration transparency using packet forwarding. Each mobile host has a home address and a temporary address when they are temporarily located on some network.
Reference: [107] <author> T. Watson, </author> <title> Application Design for Wireles Computing, </title> <booktitle> Proceedings of the IEEE Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications, </booktitle> <year> 1994. </year>
Reference-contexts: The privileges of a Tab could be easily revoked by killing the proxy server associated with it. The typical bandwidth was 19.2Kbps, although bandwidths up to 1 Mb/s were possible. Experiences with designing applications for wireless computing are described in <ref> [107] </ref>. The theme is that developers should exploit application-specific knowledge to address mobile resource constraints. In certain cases, it was shown to be desirable to offer alternative actions to 12 the user, allowing them to make performance versus cost decisions.

Reference-contexts: A language (SKI-F), useful for interagent coordination is also outlined. For creating intelligent interfaces to work with mobile hosts, AI techniques sensitive to the domain of application are needed. PYTHIA, an intelligent agent to guide PDE (Partial Differential Equation) solving is introduced in <ref> [109] </ref>. PYTHIA attempts to solve the problem of determining an optimal strategy (i.e., a solution method and its parameters) for solving a given PDE problem within user specified resource and accuracy requirements.

Reference-contexts: There work uses dynamic environment variables to allow flexible sharing of customization information and provides efficient notification of environmental changes to applications. They also describe a sample application built at PARC which uses this system. In a series of articles, for instance <ref> [110] </ref> and [111], Mark Weiser outlines his vision of ubiquity. He argues that in future, decreasing hardware and communication costs will make computers available everywhere. However, he argues that this by itself is not sufficient to achieve ubiquity. Computers today are tools that demand attention to operate.

Reference-contexts: While there is an obvious market for mobile computing technology, the authors found that there is a significant mismatch between the end user requirements of mobile systems and the technologies currently available to them. In <ref> [112] </ref> Wood looks at the trends in portable computing equipment. He argues that the availability of add-on facilities through PCMCIA cards and the constant improvements in notebook's capabilities are making notebook computers more attractive to potential buyers.

Reference-contexts: In fact, this is the opposite of MPEG, where segments with lots of motion tend to result in higher bandwidth requirements. The problem of end-to-end TCP adaptation in mobile environments is addressed by Yavatkar et.al. <ref> [114] </ref>. They observed that such communication often involves a wireless segment and a much longer LAN or WAN segment. A solution is described in which intermediary code allows TCP to independently adapt to the characteristics of the two segments.

Reference-contexts: Also, the properties of the medium makes the passive broadcasting of information a desirable approach for disseminating public data. The large number of potential users brings up the issues of scaling the services available to mobile users and their appropriate organization. In <ref> [115] </ref> Yokote presents the object-oriented operating system Apertos and its underlying architecture which allows it to accommodate mobile environments. Apertos is built upon a set of objects which are characterized by a set of properties, methods, storage, etc., called metaobjects. A group of metaobjects form a metaspace.

Reference-contexts: The authors also discuss how the existing algorithms have to be tuned for a mobile environment. In <ref> [116] </ref> Zadok and Duchamp describe a mechanism for replacing files, including open files, of a read-only file system while the file system remains mounted; the act of replacement is transparent to the user. Such a replacement mechanism can improve fault-tolerance, performance, or both.

Reference-contexts: It was pointed out that a rich taxonomy of applications emerges when control is given due prominence and that the taxonomy offers valuable insights into structuring applications to function effectively under the constraints of mobility. Another approach is addressed in <ref> [117] </ref> where the idea is to use a network as a rotating information medium by periodically retransmitting the entire contents of databases. Multiple disks spinning at different speeds on the broadcast medium are superimposed in order to support non-uniform data access.
