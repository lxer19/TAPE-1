Abstract: This article documents the L A T E X package `captcont', which provids support for retaining a figure or caption number across several float environments| usually over several pages. It allows selective control over the contents of the List-of-Figures and the List-of-Tables pages. It should be compatible with all other packages that modify or extend the float environment and with the subfigure' package [3] in particular.
