Abstract: The history of digital image compositingother than simple digital implementation of known film artis essentially the history of the alpha channel. Distinctions are drawn between digital printing and digital compositing, between matte creation and matte usage, and between (binary) masking and (subtle) matting. The history of the integral alpha channel and premultiplied alpha ideas are presented and their importance in the development of digital compositing in its current modern form is made clear. Digital compositing is often confused with several related technologies. Here we distinguish compositing from printing and matte creatione.g., bluescreen matting. Digital film printing is the transfer, under digital computer control, of an image stored in digital form to standard chemical, analog movie film. It requires a sophisticated understanding of film characteristics, light source characteristics, precision film movements, film sizes, filter characteristics, precision scanning devices, and digital computer control. We had to solve all these for the Lucasfilm laser-based digital film printerthat happened to be a digital film input scanner too. My colleague David DiFrancesco was honored by the Academy of Motion Picture Art and Sciences last year with a technical award for his achievement on the scanning side at Lucasfilm (along with Gary Starkweather). Also honored was Gary Demos for his CRT-based digital film scanner (along with Dan Cameron). Digital printing is the generalization of this technology to other media, such as video and paper. Digital film compositing is the combining of two or more strips of filmin digital formto create a resulting strip of filmin digital formthat is the composite of the components. For example, several spacecraft may have been filmed, one per film strip in its separate motion, and a starfield may have also been filmed. Then a digital film compositing step is performed to combine the separate spacecrafts over the starfield. The important point is that none of the

Reference-contexts: I can remember the moment of this invention very clearly. Ed Catmull was working on his sub-pixel hidden surface algorithm for SIGGRAPH paper submission (published eventually as <ref> [Catmull78] </ref>). He was generating images of objects using this technique over different backgrounds. I was working with him to make these pictures since I was the local expert on image file formats and knew where all of the interesting background images were stored in our file system.
