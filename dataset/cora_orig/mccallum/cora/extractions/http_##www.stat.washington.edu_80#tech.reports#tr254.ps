Reference-contexts: The Bayes factor is then computed from the remainder of the data. This idea was introduced by Lempers (1971), and other implementations have been suggested more recently under the names of partial Bayes factors (O'Hagan, 1991), intrinsic Bayes factors <ref> (Berger and Perrichi, 1993) </ref>, and fractional Bayes factors (O'Hagan, 1994). 6 Accounting for Model Uncertainty Practical model-building often involves far more than the comparison of two models; there are usually many other choices to be made.

Reference-contexts: Fienberg and Mason, 1979; Grusky and Hauser, 1984). Bayes factors are now widely used in sociology, usually with BIC as an approximation. 3. Bayes factors, like Bayesian procedures generally, follow the likelihood principle <ref> (e.g., Berger and Wolpert, 1984) </ref>. As a result, in settings such as clinical trials where cases may accrue sequentially, Bayes factors may be applied without concerns about unscheduled analysis of the data. See, e.g., Cornfield (1966a,b) and Berger and Berry (1988). 4.

Reference-contexts: Thus the Bayes factor can be viewed as measuring the relative success of H 1 and H 0 at predicting the data. This is related to prequential analysis <ref> (Dawid, 1984) </ref> and also to stochastic complexity (Rissanen, 1987); the connections are discussed by Dawid (1992) and Hartigan (1992). <p> a model, but is not designed to take account of the uncertainty inherent in model-building when many models are initially considered, as in variable selection in regression. 6.5 Evaluation of Methods The efficacy of a modeling strategy can be judged by how well the resulting predictive distributions predict future observations <ref> (Dawid, 1984) </ref>. Madigan and Raftery (1994) measured predictive performance by splitting complete data into two subsets, one of which (typically about 25-50% of the total) was used to calculate model probabilities with the other subset being used as a set of test cases.

Reference-contexts: It is also reassuring that, as Berger and Delampady (1987) noted, in testing a normal mean the point null is a good approximation to an interval null as long as the width of the interval is less than about one half of the standard error of the sample mean <ref> (see also Dickey, 1976, and Verdinelli and Wasserman, 1993a) </ref>. For related discussion along these lines see Jeffreys, (1961, p. 367), Zellner (1987), and Raftery (1992). It has been argued that a comprehensive account of Bayesian model selection requires decision theory (Kadane and Dickey, 1980; Smith, 1991).

Reference-contexts: Subsequent exploratory analyses of Smith (1989, rejoinder) suggested this to be plausible, especially since there were indeed changes in measurement instruments which could have led to such a change <ref> (Fairley, 1989) </ref>. It would be possible to expand the model to take account of this, and then to test for it explicitly by calculating the Bayes factors for the expanded model against the previously considered ones.

Reference-contexts: Non-Bayesian significance tests were developed for the comparison of two models, but practical data analysis often involves far more than two models, at least implicitly. In this case, carrying out multiple frequentist tests to guide a search for the best model can give very misleading results <ref> (e.g. Freedman, 1983) </ref>. By allowing us to take account of model uncertainty, Bayes factors can avoid this problem (e.g. Raftery, Madigan and Hoeting, 1993).

Reference-contexts: Some authors, however, see the introduction of sharp hypotheses as "silly" <ref> (e.g., Gelfand, Dey, and Chung, 1992) </ref>. This point of view ignores the way scientific investigations usually proceed: though one rarely believes a scientific law in an absolute sense, it is a great convenience to speak and to act as if laws are valid.

Reference-contexts: This example concerns the evidence against extra-Binomial variability. Application 2: The Hot Hand It has been argued that belief in the "hot hand" in basketball is based on misperception of random sequences <ref> (Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky, 1985) </ref>. That is, erratic behavior of shooting may not reflect any real tendency for players to have good streaks or bad streaks, but may instead be consistent with a stable shooting percentage.

Reference-contexts: For the most part, in both of these cases, the formulation of priors is problem-specific and there is not much general methodology for it. There is, however, a modest literature on "eliciting" probabilistic information from individuals. One psychologically appealing device is the method of imaginary observations <ref> (Good, 1950) </ref>. Kadane et al. (1980) discuss a formal elicitation procedure in the context of linear regression and Garthwaite (1992) includes more recent references. Formal representation of opinion may be useful for private analysis and in verifying that a simpler public analysis leads to appropriate conclusions, as in Application 5.

Reference-contexts: We use the logarithmic scoring rule, log ^pr i (y i ) <ref> (Good, 1952) </ref>, to assess performance. Then the overall score of any rule that generates such predictive distributions is LS = i log ^pr i (y i ).

Reference-contexts: If not, analyses conditional on a single selected model fail to take account fully of uncertainty about structure, and so may well underestimate the uncertainty associated with their conclusions. This can lead, for example, to policy choices that are riskier than one thinks <ref> (Hodges, 1987) </ref>. 6.2 Occam's Window In spite of the importance of model uncertainty and the existence of a general strategy for dealing with it, at least since Leamer (1978), there have been three major obstacles to the widespread adoption of the method outlined in the previous section.

Reference-contexts: The sample size n in the definition of S needs to be figured carefully. It is apparent from the derivation of S <ref> (e.g., Kass, 1993) </ref> that n should be the rate at which the Hessian matrix of the loglikelihood function grows; thus, n becomes the number of data values contributing to the summation that appears in the formula for the Hessian.

Reference-contexts: As a result, the Bayes factor tends to be more sensitive to the choice of prior than is the posterior probability of an interval (e.g., Kass and Greenhouse, 1989; Kass, 1993). In fact, it may happen that conclusions based on estimation seem to contradict those from a Bayes factor <ref> (as illustrated in Kass and Greenhouse, 1989) </ref>. This occurs when an estimate, say of , is found to be distant from a null-hypothetical value 0 .

Reference-contexts: In this case, under certain conditions (the assumptions of null-orthogonality and local alternative mentioned in Section 5.2), the Schwarz criterion furnishes an order O (n 1 2 ) approximation to log B 12 <ref> (Kass and Wasserman, 1992b) </ref>. Thus, if one were willing to use this prior as a "reference prior" suitable for standardized reporting, the Schwarz criterion would be a reasonably good approximation to the log of the Bayes factor.

Reference-contexts: In more complex 15 cases, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, particularly the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and the Gibbs sampler, provide a general recipe (e.g. Smith and Roberts, 1993, and references therein). Another fairly general recipe is the weighted likelihood bootstrap <ref> (Newton and Raftery, 1994) </ref>.

Any of these methods gives us a sample approximately drawn from the posterior density fl () = pr (jD) = pr (Dj)()=pr (D). Substituting into equation (10) yields as an estimate for pr (D), ( m i=1 ) 1 the harmonic mean of the likelihood values (Newton and Raftery, 1994). This converges almost surely to the correct value, pr (D), as m ! 1, but it does not, in general, satisfy a Gaussian central limit theorem.

Reference-contexts: When alternatives are introduced (e.g., the Student's t distribution in place of the Normal) Bayes factors may be used to determine which best fits the data. One may also assess the influence of individual data values by computing the Bayes factor after omitting each observation in turn <ref> (Pettit and Young, 1990) </ref>. Asymptotic approximation makes the "leave-one-out" diagnostic approach easy; see Application 5. 5.1 Prior Information The problem of determining a prior distribution from available information appears throughout Bayesian inference.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, in models for binomial responses, n is the sum of the denominators, and not either the number of responses or the number of successes. In survival analysis, n is the number of uncensored observations, i.e., of deaths <ref> (Raftery, Madigan and Volinsky, 1995) </ref>. In comparing models of multivariate Normal structure (e.g. structural equation models), n is the total number of scalar observations, i.e., the number of vector observations times their dimension (Raftery, 1993b). In two-stage hierarchical models the appropriate n depends on which parameters are being tested. <p> The Markov chain Monte Carlo method had better predictive performance than Occam's window, but at the cost of greater computational expense and less easily interpretable results.

Reference-contexts: Thus the Bayes factor can be viewed as measuring the relative success of H 1 and H 0 at predicting the data. This is related to prequential analysis (Dawid, 1984) and also to stochastic complexity <ref> (Rissanen, 1987) </ref>; the connections are discussed by Dawid (1992) and Hartigan (1992).

Reference-contexts: Related remarks appear in Zellner (1978) and Stone (1979). A related argument is that the AIC picks the correct model asymptotically if the complexity of the true model grows with sample size <ref> (Shibata, 1980, 1981) </ref>. Typically this is taken to mean that the model grows in one respect (e.g. the order of an autoregressive model) but remains fixed in all other respects (e.g. normality, linearity).

Reference-contexts: Here we describe the problems; in Section 7 we will describe solutions to them. Application 1: E. coli mutagenesis. In an experiment in molecular biology <ref> (Sklar and Strauss, 1980) </ref>, the investigators hypothesized that in the uvrE strain of E. coli bacteria, mutations leading to "acetate utilization deficiency" would occur by an unusual error-prone DNA repair mechanism. As a consequence, this mutation would fail to be linked to mutations at neighboring loci.

Reference-contexts: In the simplest cases these include direct simulation and rejection sampling. In more complex 15 cases, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, particularly the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and the Gibbs sampler, provide a general recipe <ref> (e.g. Smith and Roberts, 1993, and references therein) </ref>. Another fairly general recipe is the weighted likelihood bootstrap (Newton and Raftery, 1994). Any of these methods gives us a sample approximately drawn from the posterior density fl () = pr (jD) = pr (Dj)()=pr (D).
