Abstract: Signal modeling techniques ranging from basis expansions to parametric approaches have been applied to audio signal processing. Motivated by the fundamental limitations of basis expansions for representing arbitrary signal features and providing means for signal modifications, we consider decompositions in terms of functions that are both signal-adaptive and parametric in nature. Granular synthesis and sinusoidal modeling can be viewed in this light; we interpret these approaches as signal-adaptive expansions in terms of time-frequency atoms that are highly correlated to the fundamental signal structures. This leads naturally to a discussion of the matching pursuit algorithm for deriving decompositions using overcomplete dictionaries of time-frequency atoms; specifically, we compare expansions using Gabor atoms and damped sinusoids. Such decompositions identify important signal features and provide parametric representations that are useful for signal coding and analysis-modification-synthesis.

Reference-contexts: The latter two methods are of special interest here since they provide very flexible parametric representations. 1.1. Granular Synthesis Granular synthesis is a technique in computer music which involves accumulating a large number of basic sonic components or grains to create a substantial acoustic event <ref> [1] </ref>. This approach is based on a theory of sound and perception that was first proposed by Gabor [2]; he suggested that any sound could be described using a quantum representation where each acoustic quantum or grain corresponds to a local time-frequency component of the sound. <p> Furthermore, such descriptions are psychoacoustically appropriate given the time-frequency resolution tradeoffs and limitations observed in the auditory system. In early efforts in granular music synthesis, artificial sounds were composed by combining thousands of parameterized grains <ref> [1] </ref>. Individual grains were generated according to synthetic parameters describing both time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics, for example time location, duration, envelope shape, and modulation.

Reference-contexts: This method was restricted to the synthesis of artificial sounds, however, because the representation paradigm did not have an accompanying analysis capable of deriving granular decompositions of existing sounds. Simple analysis techniques for deriving grains from real sounds were proposed in <ref> [3, 4] </ref>; the objective of such granulation approaches is to derive a representation of natural sounds that enables modifications such as time-scaling or pitch-shifting prior to resynthesis. The basic idea in these methods is to extract grains by applying time-domain windows to the signal. <p> Each windowed portion of the signal is treated as a grain, and parameterized by its window function and time location. These grains can be realigned in time or resampled in various ways to achieve desirable signal modifications <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. Similar ideas have been developed in the speech processing community [5]. Grains derived by the time-windowing process can be interpreted as signal-dependent expansion functions that are highly correlated with the signal.

Reference-contexts: Analysis methods for this sum-of-partials model are generally frame-by-frame approaches based on the short-time Fourier transform (STFT); the parameters of the partials in a given frame are found by estimating the amplitude, frequency, and phase of the peaks in the Fourier spectrum of that frame <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. These parameters are then frame-rate representations of the time-varying amplitude and frequency tracks of the partials. The frame size and analysis stride of the STFT are chosen to give a reasonable tradeoff between the efficiency of the parameterization and its accuracy in modeling the signal. <p> Typically, this interpolation is based on low-order polynomial models such as linear amplitude and quadratic frequency (cubic phase); the interpolation functions are constrained to meet amplitude, frequency, and phase matching conditions at the synthesis frame boundaries, which correspond in time to the centers of the analysis frames <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. The sinusoidal synthesis can be viewed as a sum of nonoverlapping synthesis frames, each of which is a sum of partials. <p> Sinusoidal modeling has found many applications in speech and audio coding and analysis-synthesis. This is primarily because the representation in terms of sinusoidal parameters is efficient and readily allows for such desirable transformations as time-scaling, pitch-shifting, and cross-synthesis <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. The efficiency results from the signal-adaptivity of the expansion functions, and the modification capabilities arise because the representation is parametric in nature. In effect, if the sinusoidal parameters are modified, a new set of expansion functions are derived based on those modifications. <p> As demonstrated in Figure 2 (c), the decomposition with damped sinusoids does not introduce a pre-echo. For the signal in Figure 2 (a), the dictionary of damped si-nusoids outperforms the symmetric dictionary with respect to representing the signal onset, which is particularly important in music perception <ref> [6] </ref>. In general, however, the symmetric decomposition does provide a reasonable representation of the signal. This points to the conclusion that the choice and design of dictionaries inherently depends on very specific properties desired for the representation.

Reference-contexts: by applying a multiresolution framework to the sinusoidal model, either by subband filtering followed by sinusoidal modeling of the channel signals with long frames for low-frequency bands and short frames for high-frequency bands, or by using a time-varying segmentation with short frames near transients and long frames for stationary behavior <ref> [8] </ref>. Such methods admit expansion functions with an appropriate variety of time supports into the decomposition; this results in a more accurate signal representation.

MATCHING PURSUIT Matching pursuit is a recently proposed algorithm for deriving signal decompositions in terms of expansion functions chosen from a dictionary <ref> [9] </ref>. To achieve a signal-adaptive representation, an overcomplete dictionary is used, meaning that the dictionary contains a basis for the signal space plus additional functions. <p> The mean-squared error of this approximate decomposition, namely the energy of the residual x [n] ^x [n], converges to zero as the number of iterations approaches infinity <ref> [9] </ref>. The convergence property of this successive approximation implies that I iterations will provide a reasonable I-term decomposition of the signal; global optimality, however, is not insured because of the nature of the algorithm. <p> To enable representation of a wide range of signal features, large dictionaries are used in the matching pursuit algorithm. The computation of the correlations hg; r i i is thus intensive. As noted in <ref> [9] </ref>, however, the computation can be drastically reduced using an update formula derived from equation 3; the correlations at stage i + 1 are directly related to the correlations at stage i by the equation hg; r i+1 i = hg; r i i ff i hg; g m (i) i <p> Thus, overcomplete dictionaries consisting of atoms that exhibit a wide range of localized time and frequency behaviors are of significant interest; decomposition in terms of such atoms provides an adaptive time-frequency representation of a signal <ref> [9] </ref>. Such localized time-frequency atoms correspond to the perceptually motivated quanta introduced by Gabor. <p> Gabor Atoms The literature on matching pursuit has focused largely on applications using dictionaries of Gabor atoms; these are appropriate expansion functions for time-frequency signal decompositions <ref> [9] </ref>. <p> The dictionaries discussed consist of complex atoms. This is not problematic for applications with real signals since the pursuit algorithm can be modified to derive real expansions of real signals based on a complex dictionary <ref> [9, 11] </ref>. symmetric atoms and damped sinusoids. <p> This issue of dictionary design is an open and extremely relevant question. symmetric atoms and damped sinusoids, and (b) the energy in the pre-echo of the symmetric-atom decomposition. 4.

Reference-contexts: TIME-FREQUENCY DICTIONARIES Matching pursuit can be viewed as a method of finding sparse approximate solutions to inverse problems <ref> [11] </ref>. This is equivalent to deriving sparse signal decompositions in terms of arbitrary dictionaries of expansion functions. Such decompositions are not particularly useful, however, unless the functions correspond to relevant signal structures. <p> index is simplified based on the exponential structure of the atoms, which results in a recursion relation between correlations at neighboring times: (a; !; t 1) = ae (a; !; t ) + : : : (10) where the omitted terms are corrections to account for truncation of the atoms <ref> [11] </ref>. This relation is simply a one-pole filter; it suggests interpreting the exhaustive correlation computation as an application of the signal to a dense grid of one-pole filters, which are the matched filters for the dictionary atoms. <p> A further simplification can be achieved if the dictionary has a harmonic structure; for any dictionary of harmonically modulated atoms, the FFT can be used to compute correlations over the frequency index <ref> [11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A Gabor dictionary, which includes Fourier and wavelet-like bases, is highly overcomplete when the scale, modulation, and translation parameters are not tightly restricted; such overcompleteness, especially when coupled with a nonlinear analysis like matching pursuit, yields signal-adaptive representations <ref> [12] </ref>. In applications of Gabor functions, g (t) is typically an even-symmetric window. The associated dictionaries thus consist of atoms that exhibit symmetric time-domain behavior. This is problematic for representing asymmetric signal features such as transients, which occur frequently in natural signals such as music.
