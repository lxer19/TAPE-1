Abstract: computational analysis of these factors. We use this method to analyze different types of problem solving systems, including unguided search, control rule, and case-based systems. While some aspects of the utility problem have been studied in some kinds of problem solvers, our analysis provides a general and theoretical framework for addressing this problem in problem solvers that have been studied empirically (e.g., control-rule learning systems) and in problem solvers for which little utility analysis has been performed (e.g., case-based reasoning systems). In particular, our analysis reveals that case-based reasoning systems may suffer from several different utility problems, and suggests coping strategies that would help avoid these problems as these systems are
