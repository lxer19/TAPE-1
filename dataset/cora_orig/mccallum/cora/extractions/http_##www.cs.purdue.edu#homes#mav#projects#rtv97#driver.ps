Abstract: A population of eight non-overlapping domain decomposition methods for solving Elliptic Differential Equations viewed and formulated as iterated interface relaxation procedures is considered. A comprehensive review of the underlying mathematical ideas and the computational characteristics is given. The existing theoretical results are also reviewed and high level descriptions of the various algorithms are presented. The effectiveness of these methods on 1-dimensional differential problems is investigated by presenting and discussing preliminary performance evaluation data.

Reference-contexts: We have considered the differential equation u 00 flu = f in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, where f was selected such that u (x) = e x+4 x (x1)(x:7) and assumed Dirichlet boundary conditions. All interface relaxation schemes have been implemented in a unified way using MATLAB on a SUN workstation. <p> Central differences were used to discretized the differential equation. After verifying that the convergence rate of all methods is independed of the local grid size, 160 equally distributed grid points we used to discretize the domain <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. We start all iterations from a zero initial guess and we terminate them when five correct significant digits are obtained. Unless otherwise stated fl = 20 and the values for the various parameters involved in the relaxation schemae were selected in a straight forward and naive way.

Reference-contexts: SPO A method originated from the use of Steklov-Poincare operator. We should point out that in order to preserve some uniformity in our study we have not considered a class of interesting interdomain smoothing methods which use a few modes of the expansion <ref> [5] </ref> of certain interface operators (i.e. Lagrange multipliers [10,9] or Steklov-Poincare operators [22,23]). We will 2 only briefly describe these techniques. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: There might be useful for example on determining the physical meaning and importance of the various characteristics and parameters involved in the relaxers. We should add that we have implemented most of the relaxation schemes presented above for 2-dimensional problems using Ellpack <ref> [24] </ref> assuming "skyline" domains and 1-dimensional decompositions and perform some selective experiments all of which were in good agreement with both the quantitative the qualitative conclusions we draw from our 1-dimensional experiments which we present next. <p> Nevertheless we expect that for Differential problems with discontinuities or for two-dimensional problems a more reasonable initial guess will be needed.
