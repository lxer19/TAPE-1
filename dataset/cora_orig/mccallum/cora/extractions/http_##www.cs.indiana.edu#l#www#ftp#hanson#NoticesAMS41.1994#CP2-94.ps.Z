Reference-contexts: The Construction Our construction is based upon a concept long familiar to the computer graphics community as the superquadric model of deformable curves and surfaces <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Computer graphics has proven to be a very attractive tool for investigating low-dimensional algebraic manifolds and gaining intuition about their properties [9]. In principle, a computer image of any manifold described by algebraic equations can be produced by numerically solving the equations <ref> [2] </ref> to generate a fixed tessellation, or by using equivalent ray-tracing techniques [5].

Reference-contexts: Numerical solutions typically do not naturally emphasize natural structures of manifolds, are poorly behaved near singular-ities and self-intersections, and are more difficult to explore using other visualization tools such as sub-manifold selection, coordinate transformations, and deformations. Therefore, in order to use mathematical visualization systems such as Mathematica [12], Maple <ref> [3] </ref>, or Macsyma [11], or high-performance interactive systems such as Geomview [15] or MeshView [13], one would much prefer an explicit parametric representation of a manifold's geometry.

Reference-contexts: Euler Characteristic and Compactification Transform. The genus g of the surface follows from the Riemann-Hurwitz genus formula (see, e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>): g = 2 2 (The standard proof of this formula involves a topo-logical picture quite different from the one we have presented.) The total Euler characteristic of the surface is then = 2 2g = 3n n 2 : (9) Thus we see that the n = 2 surface is

Reference-contexts: correspond topologically to Riemann surfaces for n-th roots in the complex plane with appropriate branch cuts; graphically exploring the explicit deformation between the algebraic form and the traditional branching structure of the corresponding Riemann surfaces is another fascinating exercise that we have no space to elaborate on here (see, e.g., <ref> [10] </ref>). The family of parametric constructions we have presented easily allows the interactive examination of the surfaces and their global topology, as well as exhibiting the complex phase relations and fixed points on the surfaces through the use of phase related color codes on the patches.
