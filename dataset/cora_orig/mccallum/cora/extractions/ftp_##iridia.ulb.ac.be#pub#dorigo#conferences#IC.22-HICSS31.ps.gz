Abstract: This paper introduces AntNet, a new routing algorithm for telecommunication networks. AntNet is an adaptive, distributed, mobile-agents-based algorithm which was inspired by recent work on the ant colony metaphor. We apply AntNet in a datagram network and compare it with both static and adaptive state-of-the-art routing algorithms. We ran experiments for various paradigmatic temporal and spatial traffic distributions. AntNet showed both very good performances and robustness under all the experimental conditions with respect to its competitors.

These transformations from the raw value T to the more refined value r 0 play the role of a local estimation of a traffic model. More sophisticated and computationally-demanding models could be learnt to compute a more effective traffic-dependent correction. <p> In this way, the reinforcements are proportional to the obtained goodness measure r 0 and to the previous value of node probabilities. These probabilities are then increased/decreased by the reinforcement values as follows (their sum will still be 1, being r 0 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>): P df P df + r + ; P dn P dn + r : It is now clear that the power law rescaling of the r 0 value is equivalent to the definition of a learning rate: the scale compression factor and its degree of non linearity determine

Reference-contexts: Adaptive routers are, in principle, more attractive, because they try to adapt the routing policy to the varying traffic conditions. As a drawback, they can cause oscillations in selected paths. This can generate circular routes, as well as large fluctuations in performances, specially for what concerns average delays <ref> [2] </ref>. The most widely used routing algorithms (at least considering only wide-area networks) are shortest paths algorithms. Shortest path routing has a source-destination pair perspective: there is no a global cost function to optimize. <p> Here we are only interested in data packet routing in simplified conditions, therefore, the original algorithm is reduced to the definition of routing tables by static shortest paths calculation. BF: is an implementation of the asynchronous distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm with dynamic 4 link metrics <ref> [2] </ref>. Vector-distance Bellman-Ford--like algorithms are today in use mainly for intra-domain routing, being used in the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) [9] supplied with the BSD version of Unix. SPF: is the prototype of link-state algorithms with dynamic metric for link costs evaluations. <p> On receiving this information from a neighbor node j, the receiving node i updates its table of distance estimates in the entry corresponding to the case of node j as next hop node. Iterating this procedure, known as distributed Bellman-Ford <ref> [2] </ref> and based on the principles of dynamic programming, the routing tables will converge to shortest paths tables. Link-state algorithms maintain in each node a replicated database describing all the topological details of the network components.

Reference-contexts: We used the time measure as a reinforcement signal to provide structural and temporal credit assignment. The credit assignment problem we have to face with is the typical one arising in reinforcement learning field <ref> [3] </ref>: we cannot associate to the realized performance (trip time) an exact error measure. "Optimal" times depend on traffic and/or components failure states, and they have to be considered from a network wide point of view.

Reference-contexts: These mechanisms can influence greatly the network performances <ref> [4] </ref>, but, as a first step, we wanted to check the behavior of our algorithm and of its competitors in conditions which minimize the number of critical interacting components. In our model the instance of the communication network is mapped on a directed weighted graph with N nodes.

Reference-contexts: The routing algorithm that we propose in this paper was inspired by previous works on ant colonies and, more generally, by the notion of stigmergy, introduced by Grasse <ref> [7] </ref> to describe the indirect communication taking place among individuals through modifications induced in their environment. Real ants have been shown to be able to find shortest paths using only the pheromone trail deposited by other ants [1]. <p> This specific form of indirect communication through the environment with no explicit level of agents coordination is called stigmergy <ref> [7, 13, 15] </ref>. Active stigmergy occurs when an agent alters the environment so as to affect the input of another agent, passive stigmergy occurs when an agent alters the environment in such a way that the effect of the actions of the other agents is no more the same.

Reference-contexts: SPF: is the prototype of link-state algorithms with dynamic metric for link costs evaluations. A similar algorithm was implemented in the second version of ARPANET [10] and in its successive revisions <ref> [8] </ref>. We implemented it with state-of-the-art link costs evaluation and flooding algorithms. SPF 1F: is the same as SPF but with flooding limited to the first neighbors. As far as we know, this is the first time that a similar algorithm is presented in literature. <p> The mean of the transmission time over the link, T l , and the mean delay in the link's queue, D q (l) , are computed over the last time-window. The link cost is then assigned to <ref> [8] </ref>: 1 T l =( D q (l) + T l ). 4. The link cost is a weighted combination of a pair of the above metrics.

Reference-contexts: Algorithms BF , SP F and SP F 1F use a dynamic metric for link costs. We tried the following different metrics documented in literature <ref> [12] </ref>. 1. The link cost is measured by the fraction of time of non-empty queue with respect to the empty-queue period, measured over the last time-window. 2. <p> Traffic patterns. Two models, static and dynamic, of temporal traffic patterns have been used, modeling respectively the case of Constant Bit Rate (CBR) and of Variable Bit Rate (VBR) <ref> [12] </ref>. * In the static model all the sessions start at the beginning of the simulation and they last until the end. In this way we simulate a situation of stationarity.

Reference-contexts: This information is then back-propagated by another ant moving in the opposite direction and is used to modify the routing tables of visited nodes. We report on the behavior of AntNet as compared to some effective static and adaptive vector-distance and link-state shortest paths routing algorithms <ref> [14] </ref>. AntNet shows the best performances and the more stable behavior for all the paradigmatical temporal and spatial traffic distributions considered. Absolute performances are scored according to a scale defined by an ideal algorithm giving an empirical bound. <p> ERBFMBICT 961153). Marco Dorigo is a Research Associate with the FNRS. Appendix: Shortest Path Routing In relation to the different content stored in each node routing table, shortest path algorithms can be classified as distance-vector or link-state <ref> [14] </ref>. They show the following common behavior: each node assigns a static or dynamic cost (assigned on the basis of failure states and of some link-traffic statistics averaged over a time-window) to each of its outgoing links and broadcasts them periodically to its neighbor nodes.

Reference-contexts: Routing decisions can only be made on the basis of local and approximate information about the current and the future network states. These features make the problem well adapted to be solved following a multiagent approach like our AntNet system, composed by two sets of homogeneous mobile agents (see <ref> [15] </ref> for an agents taxonomy), called in the following respectively forward and backward ants. Agents 1 in each set possess the same structure, but they are differently situated in the environment; that is, they can sense different inputs and they can produce different, independent outputs. <p> This specific form of indirect communication through the environment with no explicit level of agents coordination is called stigmergy <ref> [7, 13, 15] </ref>. Active stigmergy occurs when an agent alters the environment so as to affect the input of another agent, passive stigmergy occurs when an agent alters the environment in such a way that the effect of the actions of the other agents is no more the same.
