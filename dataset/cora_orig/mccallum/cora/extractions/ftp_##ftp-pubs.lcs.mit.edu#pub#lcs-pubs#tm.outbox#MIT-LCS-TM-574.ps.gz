Reference-contexts: Altough much progress was done in proving the hardness of CVP [3], where the problem is proved NP-hard to approximate within any constant factor and quasi-NP-hard within quasi-polynomial factors, the hardness of computing even the exact solution to the SVP remained an open question until recently when Ajtai <ref> [2] </ref> proved that the SVP is NP-hard for randomized reductions. <p> This result is achieved by reducing the approximate SVP from a variant of the CVP which can be proven NP-hard to approximate using essentially the same arguments as in [3]. The techniques to reduce CVP to SVP are similar to those used in <ref> [2] </ref> where the problem is reduced from a variant of subset sum. However the similarities between the CVP and the SVP leads both to a much simpler proof and a much stronger result.

Proof: See Theorem 2.2 in <ref> [2] </ref>. 2 We can now prove lemma 1. Let * be a positive constant less than 1=2 and let k be a sufficiently large integer.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper we show that approximating the shortest vector in a lattice within any constant factor less than p 2 is NP-hard for randomized reduc tions. The first intractability results for lattice problems date back to <ref> [10] </ref> where van Emde Boas proved that the closest vector problem (CVP) is NP-hard and conjectured that the shortest vector problem was also NP-hard.
