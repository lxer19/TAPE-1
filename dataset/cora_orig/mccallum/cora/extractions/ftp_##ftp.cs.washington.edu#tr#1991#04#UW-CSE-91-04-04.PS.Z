Title: Mesh and Torus Chaotic Routing

Abstract: The chaos router is an adaptive nonminimal message router for multicomputers that is simple enough to compete with the fast, oblivious routers now in use in commercial machines. It improves on previous adaptive routers by using randomization, which eliminates the need for complex livelock protection and speeds the router. The two-dimensional chaos router is shown to be theoretically sound and physically realizable. Extensive simulation studies compare chaos routing with oblivious and deflection routing in mesh and torus networks. Chaos routing is shown to be competitive for mesh networks and superior for torus networks. This high performance is, perhaps, unexpected for the mesh since there is no finite bound on the delivery time of any message.

Reference-contexts: Its vertex transitive property aids the chaos router in giving it significantly better performance. The chaotic torus router is the best two dimensional packet router to our knowledge and thus a candidate for the next generation parallel computers. 2 2 Relationship to Previous Research Borodin and Hopcroft <ref> [BH85] </ref> use the term oblivious to refer to routers for which the path of any message is completely determined by its [source, destination] pair. They proved that oblivious routers in an N node, d degree topology require p N =d 3=2 steps to route some permutations.

Reference-contexts: Their technique | select a random intermediate destination for every message, route the message to that destination and then on to the true destination | was applied to batched routing in a hypercube. It could obviously be applied continuously <ref> [CS86] </ref> and in two-dimensional topologies. The main difficulty with this type of randomization is that it doubles the expected path length of any message.

Reference-contexts: A disturbing property of the torus oblivious router is that the maximum throughput is achieved at less than the maximum load. This is due to a disturbance of the vertex-transitivity of the network introduced by the addition of deadlock prevention. Since the virtual-channel deadlock prevention scheme applied <ref> [DS87] </ref> distinguishes certain nodes as "special" in order to break cycles, the uniformity of the network is broken and hot spots are introduced at high loads. This results in the degradation of throughput as load is increased.

Reference-contexts: An adaptive mesh router was proposed by Ngai and Seitz [NS89], but it differs from the chaotic approach by using timestamps and prioritization to prevent against livelock. Comparisons between prioritized and chaotic routers have been performed [KS91]. Adaptive wormhole routing using virtual channels has been studied by Duato <ref> [Dua91] </ref>. "Hot potato" or deflection routing is another scheme capable of adaptive routing [Smi81, Max89, FS91, Smi89]. The approach is synchronous and the time step is long enough to transmit an entire packet.

Specifically, the router consists of a set of input and output frames and a crossbar switch which connects each input frame to every output frame. Each channel has one input frame and one output frame, each capable of holding exactly one fixed-size message 1 .

Reference-contexts: The technique is nonminimal, i.e. messages do not necessarily take minimal paths to their destinations, and randomization plays a critical role in preventing livelock, i.e. in preventing messages from continually circulating in the network without being delivered <ref> [KS90] </ref>. Though the principles apply as well to batched message communication, chaotic routing assumes a continuous workload where messages are presented at the nodes for injection into the network at random real (or fine-grain discrete) times. <p> Thus, messages bouncing off the hot spot will eventually age enough to be routed through it. Matters are not so certain for the chaos router, however. The primary advancement of chaotic routers <ref> [KS90] </ref> is that they eliminate the time stamping and the time consuming prioritization, replacing it with a reliance on randomization. But there is no mechanism that can assure the delivery of a message in a fixed finite time.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Chaotic routing is a randomizing, adaptive, message routing technique that has previously been shown (in simulations) to be effective for the binary n-cube (hypercube) topology <ref> [KS91] </ref>. The technique is nonminimal, i.e. messages do not necessarily take minimal paths to their destinations, and randomization plays a critical role in preventing livelock, i.e. in preventing messages from continually circulating in the network without being delivered [KS90]. <p> An adaptive mesh router was proposed by Ngai and Seitz [NS89], but it differs from the chaotic approach by using timestamps and prioritization to prevent against livelock. Comparisons between prioritized and chaotic routers have been performed <ref> [KS91] </ref>. Adaptive wormhole routing using virtual channels has been studied by Duato [Dua91]. "Hot potato" or deflection routing is another scheme capable of adaptive routing [Smi81, Max89, FS91, Smi89]. The approach is synchronous and the time step is long enough to transmit an entire packet. <p> Pausing for traffic to clear cushions the affects of bursts. Finally, chaotic routing resorts to derouting only under conditions of high load, when slower performance is inevitable. 3 Chaos Router Design The chaotic router studied here is a two dimensional variant of the hypercube chaotic router <ref> [KS91] </ref>. The basic design of the chaos router is similar to a typical oblivious virtual cut-through router, with input and output frames connected by a crossbar switch, and hardware to increment or decrement the headers of messages as they pass through (see Figure 2). Two primary distinctions exist, though.

For the studies of chaos routing, we use the following network model: The network is a regular two-dimensional network of bi-connected nodes.
