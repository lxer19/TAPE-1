Abstract: This paper introduces the notion of universal interaction, allowing a device to adapt its functionality to exploit services it discovers as it moves into a new environment. Users wish to invoke services such as controlling the lights, printing locally, or reconfiguring the location of DNS servers from their mobile devices. But a priori standardization of interfaces and methods for service invocation is infeasible. Thus, the challenge is to develop a new service architecture that supports heterogeneity in client devices and controlled objects, and which makes minimal assumptions about standard interfaces and control protocols. We motivate the need for these components by using an example scenario to derive the design requirements for our mobile services architecture. We then present a prototype implementation of elements of the architecture and some example services using it, including controls to audio/visual equipment, extensible mapping, server autoconfiguration, location tracking, and local printer access.

Reference-contexts: A failure to keep accurate time can break some security systems, notably Kerberos. Spawning a local RTP gateway transcoder for MBone sessions is necessary if movement has changed the bottleneck link between source and receiver <ref> [1] </ref>. Autoconfiguration also adds a level of fault tolerance. If a network link goes down, SIP beacons coming across the failed link will stop. The client will wait for other beacons to be obtained (c.f., overlay networking), and reconfiguration to the new servers will happen transparently.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the infrastructure needs to explicitly support this in addition to the event delivery mechanism required from the device mobility support layer. Examples of such useful intermediate agents include web proxies that perform on-demand dynamic transcoding [10], network data caches, real-time media transcoders <ref> [2] </ref>, and multicast-to-unicast gateways for multicast-unaware client devices (i.e., most PDAs). Proxy, gateway, and server autoconfiguration is important in a mobile environment for more than just efficiency. <p> Using such an approach requires the devices to be manually adapted to new environments. Our conception of a proxy server is based on the model ex pressed explicitly in the Berkeley Client/Proxy/Server model [10] and implicitly in other work <ref> [6, 2] </ref> that places application-level or network-level entities near, but not at, the endpoints of communications. This is another way of thinking about Active Networks [33], driven by end-to-end design principles [25]: push agents to as close to the endpoints as possible.

Reference-contexts: This concept of leveraging the well-connected, computationally powerful side of the wireless link (via proxies or agents) pervades mobility research. It is also driven by the growing availability of workstation farms <ref> [3] </ref> designed to provide compute resources for just such applications. 7 Future and Continuing Work Our continuing work involves iterating over the design and investigating various implementation approaches.

Reference-contexts: This nonce-based exclusion can be overridden, but by making the default access restricted, we better emulate the existing paradigm. As for mobile code security, by transferring only a GUI to the client, it is probable that a sandboxed environment (such as Java, Safe-Tcl, or Janus <ref> [12] </ref>) can be used without constraining the service's functionality. 3.6 Client Interfaces Clients can be computationally impoverished, have variations in display (color depth, resolution, screen size), support different interface paradigms (keyboard, pen, touch), and are often interchangeable with one another (and therefore not preconfigured).

Examples include attaching semantic meaning to particular names and defining relationships between data values. 6 Related Work The Rover <ref> [15] </ref> and Wit [36] systems also recognized the need to split applications into a lightweight front-end and more heavyweight proxy at the last hop wireless link. <p> It also requires a mechanism for securely delegating operations [19].

Reference-contexts: These are now described in detail in the following subsections. 2.2 Device Mobility A critical component of the scenario is device mobility. The client moves from a wide-area network to a local-area network, and between points in the local-area. This functionality is available through Mobile-IP [24] and network overlays <ref> [17] </ref>. The former supplies IP-level transparency to changes in location, and the latter augments this functionality with a policy layer for managing connectivity to multiple available network interfaces and a mechanism for seamless (low-latency) hand-off.

The IDL is used in addition to other reference language implementations of an interface, thus allowing for compatible but independent coexisting interfaces.

Interested readers are pointed to the Internet draft and the Service Location working group mailing list. <p> Rover allows the pieces that comprise the partitioned whole to migrate between these two points, but the implemented prototype applications generally only exploit this for moving application data units such as mail messages, news articles, web pages, or calendar entries. The Service Location Protocol (SLP) <ref> [34] </ref> is an example resource discovery and service registration mechanism that can also function as a fine-grained name service. We are interested in moving our resource discovery mechanism over to this evolving Internet standard.

Reference-contexts: It has the advantage that applications need not change at all, but suffers from the limitations that 1) it doesn't support transformations of the interface to formats more suitable to particular client devices, and 2) it does not provide a layer of indirection underneath widget invocations. The Mobisaic <ref> [35] </ref> and Dynamic Documents [16] projects support a HTML-based structure for varying, location-dependent interfaces. Our scheme generalizes these approaches by incorporating resource discovery and interoperability of different interface elements. The Georgia Tech CyberGuide project [21] focuses on proto-typing applications augmented with various positioning systems, potentially without communications at all.

Reference-contexts: We leverage their work, along with a version of Tcl-DP [30] as the RPC interface, and extend it for use in our environment. 4.5.1 Design and Architecture The application is built in a client/server framework supporting the principle of application partitioning <ref> [36] </ref>. Due to the potential lightweight nature of clients, the server is required to bear the brunt of the effort to support fault tolerance, access control, and other such duties. <p> Similarly to the OSI application layer, it encapsulates application-specific state or data not captured by the lower layers. Examples include attaching semantic meaning to particular names and defining relationships between data values. 6 Related Work The Rover [15] and Wit <ref> [36] </ref> systems also recognized the need to split applications into a lightweight front-end and more heavyweight proxy at the last hop wireless link.

Reference-contexts: We use server beaconing rather than client beaconing, and allow the beacons to bootstrap resource location, define scope, assist fault detection, and provide private location management. A transportable X display <ref> [38] </ref> is a variation on interface code mobility; it moves users' existing interfaces as they move, not unknown applications' interfaces or interface descriptions.
