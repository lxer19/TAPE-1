Abstract: In this paper we provide a compact, formal description for an important class of problems involving the deployment of diverse equipment (e.g., planes, ships, trucks) to transport cargo (e.g., personnel and material) throughout large geographical areas for private, government, and military purposes. The problem is particularly interesting for its combination of static and dynamic sources of complexity, and the fact that it allows and in some cases strongly encourages distributed solutions. The merit of this formalization is shown by its application to both understanding the complexities in existing restricted transportation problems and creating new natural restrictions on the general problem. Starting from the general formulation we are able to isolate the static and dynamic sources of complexity in transportation problems and relate them to existing research in computer science and operations research. In addition, we describe techniques for constructing algorithms for the transportation problem with provable performance guarantees.

Reference-contexts: As another example of an approximation algorithm related to the transportation problem, consider the bin packing problem. In the bin packing problem, we are given a finite set of items of rational size 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and we must partition the items into the fewest number of sets such that no set contains items that sum to more than one. <p> An algorithm is considered strongly competitive if the factor obtained is provably the best possible. An example of a strongly competitive algorithm is given by [26]. In <ref> [1] </ref> the authors use the notion of polylog (n)-competitive to describe an on-line scheduling problem related to transportation problems. They describe an on-line algorithm to balance the job load in a network of processors that is provably polylog (n)-competitive with the best off-line algorithm.

Reference-contexts: This work introduces the concept of randomized rounding in which high-probability algorithms are obtained for integer problems by first solving a relaxed linear program and then using the resulting real-number values to determine integer values for the variables. (See <ref> [2] </ref> for recent results in using linear programming for solving complex transportation problems). In [12] we apply this randomized rounding technique to the greyhound problem. We demonstrate the benefits of this method for restrictions of the greyhound problem by providing algorithmic solutions.

Reference-contexts: This maxim points to the dynamic complexities involved in operating in a changing environment. Anytime algorithms address this issue by providing iterative algorithms that achieve better solutions as more time for computation is available, but are able to provide some solution at any time <ref> [3] </ref>. In other words, the quality of the solution (i.e., performance guarantee) is a function of the computation time.

Anytime algorithms have many applications to transportation problems.

Reference-contexts: We can obtain provable performance guarantees for certain problems by constructing approximation algorithms. Approximation algorithms apply to optimization problems in which we can be content with solutions that are provably near-optimal using fast (polyno-mial) algorithms.

For more background details on the initiative see <ref> [11, 27, 42, 40] </ref>. The specific problem faced by the initiative is concerned with directing the operators and equipment involved in transporting material and personnel for the United States military. This is the problem currently faced by the United States Transportation Command. <p> In this section, we discuss two of these techniques that provide performance guarantees in the face of dynamic sources of complexity. They are anytime algorithms and competitive algorithms. A classic military maxim is "Good plans offered now are always better than perfect plans offered later" <ref> [11] </ref>. This maxim points to the dynamic complexities involved in operating in a changing environment. Anytime algorithms address this issue by providing iterative algorithms that achieve better solutions as more time for computation is available, but are able to provide some solution at any time [3].

Reference-contexts: An induced graph corresponding to our example is given in Figure 6.

For a more detailed treatment of the greyhound problem see <ref> [12] </ref>. 20 21 3.3 Comparing the Two Special Cases In the general transportation formulation of Section 2, properties on basic entities are left unspecified. This lack of structure can lead to combinatorial problems. Both the dial-a-ride and greyhound problems address this issue by further constraining the problem. <p> In <ref> [12] </ref> we apply this randomized rounding technique to the greyhound problem. We demonstrate the benefits of this method for restrictions of the greyhound problem by providing algorithmic solutions. We also demonstrate the limitations of applying this method to more general transportation problems.

In the shortest weight-constrained path problem <ref> [15] </ref>, we are given: a graph G = (V; E); length l (e) 2 Z + , for each e 2 E; weight w (e) 2 Z + , for each e 2 E; specified vertices s; t 2 V ; and positive integers K; W ; and ask the question: <p> path (all vertices in the path are distinct) in G from s to t with total weight W or less and total length K or less? This problem is NP-complete for directed and undirected graphs, but solvable in polynomial time if all weights are equal or all lengths are equal <ref> [15] </ref>. This problem indicates that an optimal assignment of assets to packages, even for a single package, is NP-complete. Another closely related problem from [15] is the path constrained network flow problem. <p> or less? This problem is NP-complete for directed and undirected graphs, but solvable in polynomial time if all weights are equal or all lengths are equal <ref> [15] </ref>. This problem indicates that an optimal assignment of assets to packages, even for a single package, is NP-complete. Another closely related problem from [15] is the path constrained network flow problem. <p> It is similar to the static transportation problem in that it specifies a set of paths, each with a unique cost (size). However, it does not specify schedules since paths do not include any timing information. A third related problem is the directed two-commodity integral flow problem <ref> [15] </ref>. <p> We can obtain provable performance guarantees for certain problems by constructing approximation algorithms. Approximation algorithms apply to optimization problems in which we can be content with solutions that are provably near-optimal using fast (polyno-mial) algorithms. Good discussions of approximation algorithms can be found in <ref> [15, 10] </ref>. When analyzing an approximation algorithm, we compare the value of the solution with the optimal value for the optimization problem. <p> There are further details concerning the difference between absolute performance bounds and asymptotic performance bounds that we will not go into here (see <ref> [15] </ref>). In the analysis of a given approximation algorithm, we would like to upper and/or lower bound this ratio. <p> While this problem is also NP-hard, an approximation algorithm exists <ref> [15] </ref> that can find a solution in which the number of sets in the partition is within 22% of the optimal number of sets. There is an extension on the approximation algorithm idea into what is called an approximation scheme.

To account for change over time, we borrow from the systems theory literature by defining an appropriate state space and dynamical system <ref> [19] </ref>. The state space is determined by a set of state variables corresponding to the location of each asset, the asset containing each package, and the status of each property for each location, route, asset, and package. <p> We distinguish between state and control in keeping with standard practice in the control literature.

Reference-contexts: This analysis is similar to that of approximation algorithms in that we are interested in the ratio of the best on-line to the best off-line solution, online (I) of f line (I) : An algorithm is termed k-competitive <ref> [20] </ref> if the ratio is within a factor k. An algorithm is considered strongly competitive if the factor obtained is provably the best possible. An example of a strongly competitive algorithm is given by [26].

There is a well-developed body of research in sequencing and scheduling that explores some of the questions with which we are concerned <ref> [22] </ref>. This research is divided into single machine deterministic problems, parallel machine deterministic problems, stochastic problems and job shop problems. If we are to take advantage of results in the scheduling literature, we must describe our problem in terms of machines, jobs, operations, etc. <p> This simplified problem also appears to be NP-hard, based on related scheduling results above. However, when uncertainty is introduced into the problem and we are looking for expected performance rather than exact performance, it is often the case that NP-hard problems can be solved in polynomial time <ref> [22] </ref>. Similar optimality relaxation results for approximation algorithms are discussed in Section 4.3. 25 A second body of research that relates to features in the transportation problem are shortest path, traveling salesman (TSP) and multicommodity flow problems [14, 18, 9, 35]. <p> They describe an on-line algorithm to balance the job load in a network of processors that is provably polylog (n)-competitive with the best off-line algorithm. This scheduling problem is similar to the parallel machine scheduling problems mentioned in Section 4.1 and described fully in <ref> [22] </ref>. This demonstrates the use of competitive algorithms to bound the performance of an on-line scheduling problem. In the past, researchers have recognized the tradeoffs inherent in the extremes characterized by anticipatory control strategies involving complex forms of inference and responsive control strategies involving much simpler forms of inference.

Reference-contexts: Results from this area may also be applicable to the dynamic nature of the transportation problem, including their consideration of the problem of partial information. The results of Ramadge, Wonham and Lin <ref> [33, 24] </ref> are encouraging in that they are the first results we have come upon that enable us to formally analyze the feasibility of a distributed solution. They provide conditions under which distributed solutions are provably feasible. In the DES context, the complexity of synthesizing supervisors is the relevant measure.

Reference-contexts: This notion differs from 35 the traditional concept in which algorithms provide only one solution at the completion of processing. Anytime algorithms have many applications to transportation problems. In [4] anytime vehicle routing solutions are provided based on the edge-exchange algorithm of <ref> [25] </ref>.

The major difference from deterministic quicksort is that, in random quicksort, the splitter element is picked randomly. <p> The probability in this case is 1 O (n 6 ). In other words, the probability that random quicksort will terminate in O (n log n) steps is very close to one <ref> [31] </ref>. Randomization techniques can also be used to construct approximation algorithms that are provably close to optimal with high-probability. The relation of multicommodity flow problems to transportation problems was mentioned in Section 4.1.

Reference-contexts: Results from this area may also be applicable to the dynamic nature of the transportation problem, including their consideration of the problem of partial information. The results of Ramadge, Wonham and Lin <ref> [33, 24] </ref> are encouraging in that they are the first results we have come upon that enable us to formally analyze the feasibility of a distributed solution. They provide conditions under which distributed solutions are provably feasible. In the DES context, the complexity of synthesizing supervisors is the relevant measure. <p> They provide conditions under which distributed solutions are provably feasible. In the DES context, the complexity of synthesizing supervisors is the relevant measure. A supervisor is a control program that restricts the dynamical system from entering certain states. Ramadge and Wonham <ref> [33] </ref> give polynomial algorithms for solving some supervisor synthesis problems. However, they show that it is unlikely that techniques to realize minimal supervisors will be feasible in large problems.

Reference-contexts: So, for any instance of the TSP problem satisfying this condition, a solution can be found quickly (in polynomial time) that provides a tour in which the vehicle travels no more than 50% more than the optimal tour. It is interesting to note that it has been shown <ref> [34] </ref> that a good approximation algorithm to solve the TSP problem without the triangle inequality constraint cannot be found in polynomial time unless P = N P . As another example of an approximation algorithm related to the transportation problem, consider the bin packing problem.

Reference-contexts: In Section 5, we explore how to deal with dynamic sources of complexity. 3.1 Subscriber Dial-a-Ride Problem One reformulation of the general transportation problem that has been studied in the literature is the Subscriber Dial-a-Ride Problem <ref> [36, 7] </ref>. This problem consists of a set of customers (packages) who each need to be delivered from a source location to a destination location. In addition, the pickup and/or delivery time for each customer is specified. <p> In cases where only pickup or delivery times are given the corresponding term can be dropped. The dial-a-ride problem can be expressed and solved as a linear program. A mathematical formalization for this problem is found in <ref> [36] </ref>. 3.2 Greyhound Package Scheduling Problem A second reformulation of the general transportation problem is the Greyhound Package Scheduling Problem. This problem is characterized by fixed asset schedules resembling bus schedules. <p> It is beyond the scope of this article to go into detail about the specific concepts of these related lines of research and mappings from their terminology to the transportation domain. For a more detailed discussions see <ref> [22, 6, 36, 9, 17, 15] </ref>. There is a well-developed body of research in sequencing and scheduling that explores some of the questions with which we are concerned [22]. This research is divided into single machine deterministic problems, parallel machine deterministic problems, stochastic problems and job shop problems.

Reference-contexts: We demonstrate the benefits of this method for restrictions of the greyhound problem by providing algorithmic solutions. We also demonstrate the limitations of applying this method to more general transportation problems. Algorithmic solutions to the dial-a-ride problem are discussed in <ref> [29, 37, 5, 39] </ref>. It should be noted that approximation and randomization techniques can be applied to the dynamic problems discussed in Section 5 as well as the static ones discussed here.

Reference-contexts: In Section 5.2, we consider the difference between the off-line (static) construction of schedules and the on-line (dynamic) construction of schedules. In <ref> [38] </ref> a method of analysis is developed that compares the performance of an on-line algorithm on any sequence of operations to the performance of the optimum off-line algorithm (i.e., one in which the entire sequence is known in advance) on the same sequence of operations.

Reference-contexts: In these systems the number of states increases exponentially with the number of components. Tsitsiklis <ref> [41] </ref> provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of certain classes of supervisors and then demonstrates polynomial-time algorithms for showing whether or not those conditions are met for specific DES. However, this only shows the existence of a supervisor in polynomial-time.
