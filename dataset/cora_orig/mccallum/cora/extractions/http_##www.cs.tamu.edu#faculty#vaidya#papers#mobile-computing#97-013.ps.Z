Abstract: In ad hoc network environments, any techniques to reduce high routing-related overhead are worth investigating. This brief note explains how to exploit location information to improve ad hoc routing. We also suggest some optimization approaches that can improve the performance of the protocol. fl Research reported is supported in part by Texas Advanced Technology Program 009741-052-C.

Reference-contexts: Utilizing location information with ad hoc routing has a purpose similar to selective paging scheme in PCS (Personal Communication Service) networks <ref> [1] </ref> in that both are trying to reduce the overhead of wireless resources. In selective paging, the network pages a selected subset of the cells close to the last reported location of a mobile host only when the host needs to be located.

As the hosts in such a network are mobile, an inherent drawback of these protocols (more precisely, drawback of the network) is that routing-related overhead tends to be high. Therefore, any techniques to reduce this overhead are worth investigating. <p> To see how location information may be used, let us consider the dynamic source routing (DSR) protocol suggested by Johnson and Maltz <ref> [11] </ref>. In this protocol, say at time t 1 , when a source node S needs to locate a destination node D, it floods the network with a route request for the destination node.

In this protocol, say at time t 1 , when a source node S needs to locate a destination node D, it floods the network with a route request for the destination node. (The optimizations proposed in [11] to reduce the message overhead can be used in conjunction with the approach proposed here.) The route request packets are broadcasted into whole networks everytime a path between the source and destination needs to be found. <p> ZRP is a hybrid reactive/proactive routing protocol in that each node always knows about locally who are its neighbor nodes by using proactive protocols (such as, 7 the family of distance vector or shortest path first protocols [13, 15]), whereas global search using reactive protocols (also called on-demand <ref> [11, 14] </ref>) is done for non-neighbor nodes that are far from each other. If a node has location information about non-neighbor nodes requiring global search, that information can be useful for reducing the search overhead.
