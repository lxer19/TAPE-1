Abstract: A constant rebalanced portfolio is an investment strategy which keeps the same distribution of wealth among a set of stocks from period to period. Recently there has been work on on-line investment strategies that are competitive with the best constant rebalanced portfolio determined in hindsight (Cover, 1991; Helmbold et al., 1996; Cover and Ordentlich, 1996a; Cover and Ordentlich, 1996b; Ordentlich and Cover, 1996; Cover, 1996). For the universal algorithm of Cover (Cover, 1991), we provide a simple analysis which naturally extends to the case of a fixed percentage transaction cost (commission), answering a question raised in (Cover, 1991; Helmbold et al., 1996; Cover and Ordentlich, 1996a; Cover and Ordentlich, 1996b; Ordentlich and Cover, 1996; Cover, 1996). In addition, we present a simple randomized implementation that is significantly faster in practice. We conclude by explaining how these algorithms can be applied to other problems, such as combining the predictions of statistical language models, where the resulting guarantees are more striking.

Reference-contexts: These 2 A. BLUM AND A. KALAI properties are satisfied by the optimal investor who must simultaneously rebalance her portfolio and pay for these transaction costs from the sale of stock. In Section 3 we present a new, simpler analysis and implementation for Cover's universal algorithm <ref> (Cover, 1991) </ref>. It is along the same lines of reasoning as an argument in (Foster and Vohra, 1995). We show how our argument extends to the case of commission in Section 4. <p> Finally, in Section 7, we explain how these stock market algorithms can be used on other problems, such as combining the predictions of language models almost as well as if we had prior knowledge of the optimal mixture. 2. Notation and Definitions We use mainly the notation of <ref> (Cover, 1991) </ref>. A price relative for a given asset is the nonnegative ratio of closing price to opening price during a given period.

Reference-contexts: As a result, the universal algorithm thus has an increasing fraction of its total holdings in CRPs that rebalance a smaller percentage of their holdings. 7. Application to Statistical Language Modeling Analogies between universal compression and the UNIVERSAL algorithm have been made by Cover <ref> (Cover, 1996) </ref>. The EG () portfolio algorithm of (Helmbold et al., 1996) has also been used for finding the best mixture of predictive models (Kivanen and Warmuth, 1994; Helmbold et al., 1995).

Reference-contexts: We extend this model by adding a fixed percentage commission cost c &lt; 1 to each transaction, as is common in financial modeling <ref> (Davis and Norman, 1990) </ref>. To fully define the commission model, in addition to specifying the cost of each transaction, we must also specify how a CRP pays this overhead. In Section 2, we give three natural properties of such a specification which we will use for our analysis.
