Reference-contexts: Figure 6 shows an example of the temperature distribution of a rotating disk as modeled by FIFEA. FIFEA makes extensive use of the PETSc (Portable, Extensible, Toolkit for Scientific computation) <ref> [Balay et al., 1995] </ref> to do linear algebra and to manipulate sparse matrices and vectors. FIFEA and PETSc use the MPI library [Gropp et al., 1994] for communication between the IBM SP processors.

Reference-contexts: Virtual reality strives to be a more natural user interface to complex data, allowing the scientist to focus on the analysis of the data rather than manipulation of the analysis environment <ref> [Bishop et al., 1992] </ref>. The human senses are more accustomed to the three-dimensional world; the ability to process three-dimensional spatial information has been honed over many years of evolution [Kalawsky, 1993].

Reference-contexts: This characterization focused on reducing end-to-end delay in head-mounted systems, with emphasis on tracking lag; no attention is given to other sources of lag. In contrast, we consider all the sources of lag. 6 Methods for reducing lag are an active area of research. Such methods include pre-diction <ref> [Deering, 1992, Friedmann et al., 1992, Liang et al., 1991] </ref>, time-critical computing [Funkhouser et al., 1993, Holloway, 1991, Wloka, 1993], and use of parallelism. Prediction methods use extrapolation to reduce tracker lag by predicting future input data based upon past data.

Reference-contexts: The human senses are more accustomed to the three-dimensional world; the ability to process three-dimensional spatial information has been honed over many years of evolution <ref> [Kalawsky, 1993] </ref>. In engineering, this technology may be incorporated into the product design cycle, allowing virtual prototyping and testing of products prior to their physical construction. Hence, interactive, immersive three-dimensional visualization is an important medium for scientific applications.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, Liu et. al. <ref> [Liu et al., 1993] </ref> found lag time to be as important as the frame rate for effective use of immersive displays. Lag has been studied in the context of teleoperated machines, head-mounted displays, and telepresence systems [Liu et al., 1993, Wloka, 1995]. Liu et al.

Recall from x1 that Liu et al. <ref> [Liu et al., 1993] </ref> conducted experiments on a telema-nipulation system and found the allowable lag time was 100 ms and 1000 ms for inexperienced and experienced users, respectively. The total lag times for the 8 processor case are Q view = 129:58 ms and Q interact = 57370:05 ms.

Reference-contexts: Further, our system includes a parallel system for simulation and a shared-memory multiprocessor for rendering, interconnected via a wide area network. Therefore, we consider two additional sources of lag: the network lag and simulation lag. In <ref> [Mine, 1993] </ref>, Mine characterizes the relative performance of magnetic tracking technologies, including two magnetic trackers from Ascension Technology and two from Polhe-mus. This characterization focused on reducing end-to-end delay in head-mounted systems, with emphasis on tracking lag; no attention is given to other sources of lag.

Reference-contexts: This application was demonstrated at the Supercomputing 1995 conference as part of the Global Information Infrastructure Testbed for the IWAY (Information Wide Area Year) project. The display system consisted of an ImmersaDesk T M | a single wall of a CAVE T M (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment) <ref> [Cruz-Neira et al., 1993] </ref>. The simulation was executed on the IBM SP located at Argonne National Laboratory; the display system was located at the San Diego Convention Center. The IBM SP was connected to the display system via an ATM OC-3c network as part of the IWAY project. <p> This display system is a lower cost, more portable, and smaller alternative to the CAVE T M , a room composed of rear-projection screens <ref> [Cruz-Neira et al., 1993] </ref>. The ImmersaDesk T M provides the illusion of data immersion via visual cues, including wide field of view, stereo display, and viewer-centered perspective. A Silicon Graphics (SGI) Power Onyx computes the stereo display, with a resolution of 1024fi768 for each image.

Reference-contexts: The system used in our experiments had 128 MB of memory, 10 GB of disk, four R4400 processors and three RealityEngine2 graphics pipelines. Each RealityEngine2 has a geometry engine consisting of Intel i860 microprocessors, a display generator, and 4 MB raster memory <ref> [SGI] </ref>. The Onyx is used to drive the virtual environment interface as discussed above. The ImmersaDesk (TM), however, uses only one RealityEngine2 graphics pipeline connected to a Electrohome Marque 8000 high-resolution project to project images onto the one translucent screen.

Reference-contexts: Tracking is provided by an Ascension SpacePad unit with two inputs. One sensor tracks head movements; the other tracks a hand-held wand. These sensors capture position and orientation information on head and wand movements at rate of 10 to 144 measurements per second <ref> [SpacePad, 1995] </ref>. The existing system is configured to operate in the range of 100 measurements per second. The buttons on the wand are sampled at a rate of 100 Hz.

In <ref> [Taylor et al., 1995] </ref>, the work on lag models was extended to include scientific simulations with interactive, immersive environments. That work, however, focused on simulations executed on one processor; multiple processors for the simulations were not used or analyzed in the lag model. <p> The simulation and graphics components are interconnected via the ATM OC-3c (peak bandwidth of 155 Mbps) used with the IWAY project. 4 Performance Model The performance model presented in this section is consistent with that given in <ref> [Taylor et al., 1995] </ref>. It is presented here for completeness.
