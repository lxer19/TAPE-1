Abstract: The purpose of our project is to implement and evaluate Dienst as a possible database back-end for SWEB and the Alexandria Digital Library. Dienst is a database that conveniently manages multiple views of the same set of data. For Dienst to work well with SWEB, it must both scale well with an increasing number of processors, and also scale well with an increasing data set. We have found that coordinating an individual Dienst server with each SWEB server produces gains in the number of simultaneous requests that can be handled, as well as decreasing the time that it takes to handle an individual request under heavy load conditions. We also discuss areas in which further improvements in response time and throughput can be achieved.
