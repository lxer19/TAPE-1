Abstract: Arguing that design is a social process, we expand the meaning of modeling and analysis to include all activities facilitating continual refinement and criticism of the design requirements, process, and solutions. We do not assume any a priori methods for modeling or analysis; rather, we provide a framework and an approach to study designers and give them whatever modeling and analysis capabilities they choose. Our approach is the basis for a support tool, n-dim, currently under development.

Reference-contexts: In this expanded view of design, therefore, MA are any and all activities facilitating understanding. An "ideal" understanding facilitates efficient problem solving since understanding requires shared meaning which is, among other things, a negotiated common vocabulary <ref> (Konda et al, 1992) </ref>. However, such a state is not necessarily attainable, but can be approached via modeling, model utilization (analysis), and model refinement in the dialectic of negotiation.

The practice of design which involves multiple representations, disciplines, and designers, introduces the need to broaden the horizon of modeling techniques.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, it is premature to attempt to address the requirements of engineers from MA tools. We view the requirements of a design support system as arising mainly from how models, both formal and informal <ref> (Piela et al, 1992) </ref>, are used in context. In light of this, we have adopted a collaborative, evolutionary prototyping approach in order to situate, as much as possible, both ourselves and the tools we create in the working context.

Reference-contexts: Active participation by the end-user community so that correct problems are identified, formulated, and solved; 2. Training of the end-user community | considered one of the most impor tant issues | with sufficient resources being available for this purpose. The first condition, also adopted in our work <ref> (Reich et al, 1992) </ref>, ensures that pressing problems of design practice are addressed instead of artificial or toy problems. It also ensures that the purpose of MA | pragmatic results | is not forgotten and replaced by work on elegant but unusable tools. <p> This applies both AI EDAM, 1992, 7 (4):257-274 12 Subrahmanian et al. (1992) to us, as students of design, and to designers themselves. If we really wish to make an impact on users, our research should take a participatory mode <ref> (Reich et al, 1992) </ref> | the development of theory being coterminous with participation in and understanding of practice (Floyd et al, 1989; Namioka and Schuler, 1990; Muller et al, 1992). <p> Our contention is that the organizational is more important than the technical seemingly sound techniques fail constantly in practice due to lack of attention to organizational issues. Our development approach|participatory design and evolutionary prototyping|is geared towards alleviating this problem <ref> (Reich et al, 1992) </ref>, while the techniques implemented in n-dim are meant to give designers the ability to model and analyze their organization, the interactions with their peers, and the flow of information within the organization. 5 A description of n-dim In this section, we attempt to give first a brief
