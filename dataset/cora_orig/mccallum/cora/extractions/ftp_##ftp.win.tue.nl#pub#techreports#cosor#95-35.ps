Reference-contexts: The second condition is obviously satisfied, since the C j values originate from feasible machine schedules. The first constraint is satisfied if we show that at most m jobs are started at time zero and that the number of jobs started at any point in time t 2 <ref> [1; T ] </ref> is no more than the number of jobs completed at that point in time, where T denotes the latest point in time that a job is started. <p> The computation time was negligible for each instance. We then tested our algorithm on three classes of randomly generated instances: (i) instances with processing times drawn from the uniform distribution <ref> [1; 10] </ref> and weights from the uniform distribution [10; 100]; (ii) instances with processing times and weights both drawn from the uni form distribution [1; 100]; (iii) instances with processing times and weights both drawn from the uni form distribution [10; 20]. <p> We then tested our algorithm on three classes of randomly generated instances: (i) instances with processing times drawn from the uniform distribution [1; 10] and weights from the uniform distribution [10; 100]; (ii) instances with processing times and weights both drawn from the uni form distribution <ref> [1; 100] </ref>; (iii) instances with processing times and weights both drawn from the uni form distribution [10; 20]. We tested our algorithm on instances with n = 20; 30; 40; 50 jobs and m = 3; 4; 5 machines.

Reference-contexts: The computation time was negligible for each instance. We then tested our algorithm on three classes of randomly generated instances: (i) instances with processing times drawn from the uniform distribution <ref> [1; 10] </ref> and weights from the uniform distribution [10; 100]; (ii) instances with processing times and weights both drawn from the uni form distribution [1; 100]; (iii) instances with processing times and weights both drawn from the uni form distribution [10; 20]. <p> The computation time was negligible for each instance. We then tested our algorithm on three classes of randomly generated instances: (i) instances with processing times drawn from the uniform distribution [1; 10] and weights from the uniform distribution <ref> [10; 100] </ref>; (ii) instances with processing times and weights both drawn from the uni form distribution [1; 100]; (iii) instances with processing times and weights both drawn from the uni form distribution [10; 20]. <p> (i) instances with processing times drawn from the uniform distribution [1; 10] and weights from the uniform distribution [10; 100]; (ii) instances with processing times and weights both drawn from the uni form distribution [1; 100]; (iii) instances with processing times and weights both drawn from the uni form distribution <ref> [10; 20] </ref>. We tested our algorithm on instances with n = 20; 30; 40; 50 jobs and m = 3; 4; 5 machines. <p> Since the pricing algorithm requires pseudo-polynomial time, we may expect that the performance of our algorithm deteriorates with the size of the processing times of the jobs. Table 2 displays our results for instances belonging to class (ii), where the processing times are drawn from the uniform distribution <ref> [10; 100] </ref>. Table 2 indicates that these instances are indeed harder to solve. Not only do we need more time to solve the linear programs, which is entirely attributable to the pricing algorithm, but also slightly more search nodes. The extra time effort is modest, however.
