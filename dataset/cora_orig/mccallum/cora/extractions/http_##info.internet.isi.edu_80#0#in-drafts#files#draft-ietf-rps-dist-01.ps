Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress." Abstract The RIPE database specifications [2] and RPSL language [1] define languages used as the basis for representing information in a routing policy system. A repository for routing policy system information is known as a routing registry. A routing registry provides a means of exchanging information needed to address many issues on importance to the operation of the Internet. The implementation and deployment of a routing policy system must maintain some degree of integrity to be of any use. The Routing Policy System Security internet-draft [3] addresses the need to assure integrity of the data by proposing an authentication and authorization model. This document addresses the need to distribute data over multiple repositories and delegate authority for data subsets to multiple repositories without compromising the authorization model established in [3].

Many RPSL data objects remain unchanged from the RIPE and RPSL references the RIPE-181 specification as recorded in RFC-1786 [2]. RPSL provides external data representation. Data may be stored differently internal to an routing registry. <p> One commit completion response is sufficient to respond to the submitter with a positive confirmation that the transaction has been completed however the repository or submitter may optionally require more than one. 7 Data Format Summaries RIPE-181 [2] and RPSL <ref> [1] </ref> data is represented externally as ASCII text. Objects consist of a set of attributes. Attributes are name/value pairs. A single attribute is represented as a single line with the name followed by a colon followed by whitespace characters (space, tab, or line continuation) and followed by the value.

Reference-contexts: RPSL provides external data representation. Data may be stored differently internal to an routing registry. The integrity of the distributed registry data requires the use of the authorization and authentication additions to RPSL described in <ref> [3] </ref>. Some additions to RPSL are needed to locate all of the repositories after having located one of them and to make certain parameters selectable on a per repository basis readily available. These additions are described in Section 5. Some form of encapsulation must be used to exchange data. <p> Other sections described only meta-objects. 5.1 repository object A root repository must be agreed upon. Ideally such a repository would contain only top level delegations and pointers to other repositories used in these delegations. It would be wise to allow only cryptographically strong transactions in the root repository <ref> [3] </ref>. The root repository contains references to other repositories. <p> There may be opportunities for Villamizar,Alaettinoglu,Govindan,Meyer Expires August 23, 1999 [Page 9] INTERNET-DRAFT Distributed Routing Policy System February 23, 1999 malicious entries in objects for which there is no authorization hierarchy (See <ref> [3] </ref>). An example is the anonymous registration of falsified person objects or libelous or obscene person or role objects. In addition, mistakes or program bugs are inevitable.
