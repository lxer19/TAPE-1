Abstract: We propose a methodology for Bayesian model determination in decomposable graphical Gaussian models. To achieve this aim we consider a hyper inverse Wishart prior distribution on the concentration matrix for each given graph. To ensure compatibility across models, such prior distributions are obtained by marginalisation from the prior conditional on the complete graph. We explore alternative structures for the hyperparameters of the latter, and their consequences for the model. Model determination is carried out by implementing a reversible jump MCMC sampler. In particular, the dimension-changing move we propose involves adding or dropping an edge from the graph. We characterise the set of moves which preserve the decomposability of the graph, giving a fast algorithm for maintaining the junction tree representation of the graph at each sweep. As state variable, we propose to use the incomplete variance-covariance matrix, containing only the elements for which the corresponding element of the inverse is nonzero. This allows all computations to be performed locally, at the clique level, which is a clear advantage for the analysis of large and complex data-sets. Finally, the statistical and computational performance of the procedure is illustrated by means of both artificial and real multidimensional data-sets.

Reference-contexts: A reasonable default specification for , suggested in the literature for inference on covariance matrices <ref> (see e.g. Dickey, Lindley and Press, 1985) </ref> is to consider an intra-class correlation structure: = t ( J + (1 ) I); (12) where J is the p fi p matrix of 1's and I the identity matrix of order p.

Reference-contexts: An important point is that, since we are considering only decomposable graphs, the proposed moves should consider only members of the latter class as candidate graphical structures. 9 3.1 Incremental changes to decomposable graphs It is well-known <ref> (Frydenberg and Lauritzen, 1989) </ref> that the space of all decomposable graphs can be traversed by adding and deleting single edges at a time. <p> This characterisation may have application outside our MCMC context. While "legal" deletion moves can be characterised using a result of Frydenberg and Lauritzen (1989), which will be now quoted, "legal" addition moves still need to be characterised and we shall propose a Theorem for this purpose. Theorem <ref> (Frydenberg and Lauritzen, 1989) </ref>. Let g and g 0 be two undirected decomposable graphs, with the same vertex set V , and with E 0 E, with g having exactly one more edge than g 0 . Such an edge must then be contained in exactly one clique of g.

Reference-contexts: A completion of g is any matrix obtained from g by fixing its unspecified elements. Theorem (Dempster, 1972). If a positive definite completion of g exists, it is the unique completion whose inverse D satisfies fd ij = 0g, 8 (i; j) 62 E. Theorem <ref> (Grone et al., 1984) </ref>. If g is decomposable, and if each matrix f C ; C 2 Cg is positive definite, such a positive definite completion exists. The above results suggest employing g as an efficient representation of g .
