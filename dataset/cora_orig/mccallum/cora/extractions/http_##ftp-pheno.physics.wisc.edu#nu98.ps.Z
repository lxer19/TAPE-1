Abstract: With an effective telescope area of order 10 4 m 2 for TeV neutrinos, a threshold near ~50 GeV and a pointing accuracy of 2.5 degrees per muon track, the AMANDA detector represents the first of a new generation of high energy neutrino telescopes, reaching a scale envisaged over 25 years ago. We describe early results on the calibration of natural deep ice as a particle detector as well as on AMANDA's performance as a neutrino telescope.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction and Summary The Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array AMANDA is a multi-purpose instrument; its science missions cover particle physics, astronomy and astrophysics, cosmology and cosmic ray physics <ref> [1] </ref>. Its deployment creates new opportunities for glaciology [2]. The first-generation detector is designed to reach a relatively large telescope area and detection volume for a neutrino threshold not higher than 100 GeV. This relatively low threshold permits calibration of the novel instrument on the known flux of atmospheric neutrinos.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction and Summary The Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array AMANDA is a multi-purpose instrument; its science missions cover particle physics, astronomy and astrophysics, cosmology and cosmic ray physics [1]. Its deployment creates new opportunities for glaciology <ref> [2] </ref>. The first-generation detector is designed to reach a relatively large telescope area and detection volume for a neutrino threshold not higher than 100 GeV. This relatively low threshold permits calibration of the novel instrument on the known flux of atmospheric neutrinos. <p> We will conclude with a brief description of the data analysis of the first year of a data taken with the completed detector. 2 2 Optics of Deep Ice As anticipated from transparency measurements performed with shallow strings above 1 km depth <ref> [2] </ref> (see Fig. 1), ice is bubble-free at 1400-1500 meters and below. The performance of the AMANDA detector is encapsulated in the event shown in Fig. 5. Coincident events between AMANDA-80 and the four shallow strings have been triggered at a rate of 0.1 Hz. <p> In this event the muon mostly triggers OM's on strings 1 and 4 which are separated by 79.5 m. neutrinos and significantly larger for the high energy signals. The reality is that the absorption length is 100 m or more, depending on depth <ref> [2] </ref>. With such a large absorption length, scattering becomes a critical issue. The scattering length is 25-30 m (preliminary; this number represents an average value which may include the combined effects of deep ice and the refrozen ice disturbed by the hot water drilling).

Reference-contexts: The status of the AMANDA project can be summarized as follows: * Construction of the first-generation AMANDA detector <ref> [3] </ref> was completed in the austral summer 96-97. It consists of 300 optical modules deployed at a depth of 1500-2000 m; see Fig. 1. An optical module (OM) consists of an 8 inch photomultiplier tube and nothing else.

Reference-contexts: The optical properties of the ice are quantified by studying the propagation in the ice of pulses of laser light of nanosecond duration. The arrival times of the photons after 20 m and 40 m are shown in Fig. 6 for the shallow and deep ice <ref> [4] </ref>. The distributions have been normalized to equal areas; in reality, the probability that a photon travels 70 m in the deep ice is ~10 7 times larger. <p> We conclude from Fig. 8 that the agreement between data and Monte Carlo simulation is adequate. Less than one in 10 5 tracks is misreconstructed as originating below the detector <ref> [4] </ref>. Visual inspection reveals that the misreconstructed tracks are mostly showers, radiated by muons or initiated by electron neutrinos, which are misreconstructed as up-going tracks of muon neutrino origin. <p> The events are selected requiring signals on 2 or more, strings (left) and 5 or more, direct photons (right). quantitatively reproduce the response of the detector to cosmic ray muons: the trigger rate and the frequency and time of the response of OMs <ref> [4] </ref>. For reconstruction, 2 independent routines and 3 neural nets are available. Understanding the performance of the instrument near threshold requires a detailed calibration of the detector which is still in progress.

Reference-contexts: The technique was supposed to be a factor 5~10 more cost-effective and, therefore, competitive. The design was based on then current information <ref> [5] </ref> that the absorption length at 370 nm, the wavelength where photomultipliers are maximally efficient, had been measured to be 8 m. The strategy would have been to use a large number of closely spaced OM's to overcome the short absorption length.

Reference-contexts: absorption 95 5 m 20 m | scattering 24 2 m 150-300 m | length fl peak PMT efficiency flfl same for bluer wavelengths flflfl smaller for bluer wavelengths although additional information can be extracted from scattered photons by minimizing a likelihood function which matches their observed and expected delays <ref> [6] </ref>. The method is illustrated with AMANDA-80 data in Fig. 8, where the measured arrival directions of background cosmic ray muon tracks, reconstructed with 5 or more unscattered photons, are confronted with their known angular distribution. <p> Monte Carlo simulation, based on the AMANDA-80 reconstruction, predicts that AMANDA-300 is a 10 4 m 2 detector fro TeV muons, with 2.5 degrees mean angular resolution per track <ref> [6] </ref>. The effective area is less for atmospheric neutrinos, but in excess of 0:1 km 2 for PeV neutrinos. 10 relative normalization has not been adjusted at any level.

Reference-contexts: We have verified the angular resolution of AMANDA-80 by reconstructing muon tracks registered in coincidence with a surface air shower array SPASE <ref> [7] </ref>. Figure 9 demonstrates that the zenith angle distribution of the coincident SPASE-AMANDA cosmic ray beam reconstructed by the surface array is quantitatively reproduced by reconstruction of the muons in AMANDA.

Reference-contexts: Their properties are summarized in Table 4. They have been used to study the capability of AMANDA to search for neutrinos resulting from the annihilation of dark matter particles gravitationally trapped at the center of the earth <ref> [8] </ref>. We conclude that tracks reconstructed as up-going are found at a rate consistent with 13 the expectation that they are induced by atmospheric neutrinos. The event rates are too low to attempt a detailed calibration of the technique.
