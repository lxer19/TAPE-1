Abstract: We propose an efficient flow-control scheme for ATM ABR multicast services, especially in coping with the variation of multicast-tree structure and height, and RM (Resource Management) cell roundtrip delay. An optimal second-order rate-parameter control algorithm is developed to deal with the variation in RM-cell roundtrip delay resulting from dynamic "drift" of the bottleneck location within a multicast tree. By applying two-dimensional rate control, the proposed scheme not only makes the rate process converge to the available bandwidth of the connection's most congested link, but also confines the buffer occupancy to a target regime bounded by a given (finite) buffer capacity. As a result of employing a "soft" feedback RM-cell synchronization mechanism, the proposed scheme scales well with the height of multicast tree. By setting up no-response timers and connection-update vectors, non-responsive branches can be detected and removed quickly without affecting the operation of the entire multicast tree. Using the fluid approximation, we model the proposed scheme and study the system dynamic behavior for ABR multicast service under the most stressful traffic condition. We identify the system control factors which govern the system dynamics and dominate flow-control performance. We also study the convergence properties and optimal control conditions for the second-order rate control. We derive expressions for queue buildups and average throughputs in both transient and equilibrium states as functions of rate-control parameters, feedback delay, target bandwidth, and target buffer occupancy. The analytical results for both single and multiple concurrent multicast connections have shown the proposed scheme to be stable and efficient in that both the source rate and queue length at the bottleneck rapidly converge to a small neighborhood of the designated operating point. Also presented are examples demonstrating the superiority of the proposed scheme to the other schemes in dealing with RM-cell roundtrip delay and available bandwidth variations, and achieving fairness in both buffer and bandwidth occupancies.

Reference-contexts: Supporting ABR multicast connection service poses a number of new challenges not encountered in unicast connections. One of the major problems, especially in large multicast trees, is commonly known as the feedback implosion problem <ref> [1] </ref>. Since our goal is to adjust the source transmission rate to match the bottleneck link bandwidth, the source needs to collect congestion feedback from all branches in the tree. Simultaneous congestion feedback from all branches can cause an implosion at the source, especially when the connection tree is large.

Reference-contexts: As a result, SSP can not only support efficient feedback synchronization while eliminating the feedback implosion, but also makes effective RM-cell roundtrip delay virtually independent of the multicast-tree's height/path-length variations. These properties have been proved in our companion paper <ref> [7] </ref> (available on-line). Supported by SSP, the non-responsive branches can be easily detected/removed by using the connection-update vectors and non-responsive timers. Another key component of the proposed scheme is the second-order rate control which is developed to cope with RM-cell roundtrip delay variation. <p> The convergency and fairness of the second-order rate control have also been formally proved in <ref> [7] </ref>. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the proposed scheme. Section 3 establishes the flow-control system model. Section 4 presents the second-order rate-control algorithm and its properties. Section 5 derives analytical expressions for both transient and equilibrium states and evaluates the scheme's performance for the single-connection case. <p> In our scheme, the feedback RM-cells are "softly synchronized" at each branch-point, providing fast, complete, and efficient feedback, and making the feedback delay scalable with the height and structure of multicast tree, which are detailed in <ref> [7] </ref>. The proposed scheme can dynamically identify non-responsive downstream branches and remove them from the multicast connection. Specifically, at each switch a pair of connection-update vectors and a non-responsive timer are associated with each multicast connection. <p> This is because rate-increase/decrease control can only make R (t) fluctuate around the designated bandwidth, but cannot adjust the rate-fluctuation amplitude that determines Q max . In <ref> [7, 18] </ref>, Q max is analytically shown to increase with both t and rate-increase parameter ff = dR (t) dt and can be written as a function, Q max (t; ff), or Q max (ff) for a given t . <p> Proof. The proof is available in our companion paper <ref> [7] </ref> (available on-line). 2 Remarks: The ff-control law is similar to, but differs from, additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease algorithm in the following senses. In the transient state, the ff-control law behaves like an additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease algorithm, which accommodates statistical convergence-to-fairness of buffer utilization among the multiple multicast connections sharing a common multicast-tree bottleneck. <p> Proof. The proof is provided in our companion paper <ref> [7] </ref> (available on-line). 2 Now let R peak and Q (i) peak be the peak source rate and queue length, respectively, in the i-th transient cycle, i = 1; 2; ; N ( 1) (by assuming ff 0 1 q e ff goal or ff 0 e ff goal p).

Reference-contexts: Redefining the RM-cell format <ref> [8] </ref>, we add both the cell-rate (first-order) and the rate-parameter (second-order) control information in the standard RM-cell. In particular, two new one-bit fields, BCI (Buffer Congestion Indication) and NMQ (New Maximum Queue), are defined.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we will focus only on the CI-based scheme modeling and analysis (and report the results on ER-based scheme in another paper). We model the CI-based scheme by using the first-order fluid approximation, which characterizes the flow-control system with coupled time-delayed differential equations <ref> [9, 10] </ref>. In this model, we use the real-valued deterministic functions R (t) and Q (t) to approximate a discrete stochastic rate process R (t) at the source and a queue length process Q (t) at the bottleneck node, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we explicitly include the variation of roundtrip delay in our model, and study its relationship with multicast flow-control algorithms. We discuss this issue in the next section. 4 The Second-Order Rate Control As discussed in <ref> [18] </ref>, increasing or decreasing R (t) is not effective enough to have Q max upper bounded by C max when the multicast-tree RM-cell roundtrip delay t varies. <p> This is because rate-increase/decrease control can only make R (t) fluctuate around the designated bandwidth, but cannot adjust the rate-fluctuation amplitude that determines Q max . In <ref> [7, 18] </ref>, Q max is analytically shown to increase with both t and rate-increase parameter ff = dR (t) dt and can be written as a function, Q max (t; ff), or Q max (ff) for a given t . <p> ! 1 (q cannot be equal to 1 since q = 1 means that the ff-control is shut down), R max approaches a constant value, and the equilibrium-state performance of R attains its maximum. leads to a larger R in equilibrium state, which is also consistent with our observations in <ref> [18] </ref>, since a smaller Q goal implies a smaller ff goal . <p> Thus, together with Figure 6 (b), Figure 7 (b) also shows that the oscillation frequency is inversely proportional to the oscillation amplitude of Q (n) max . Moreover, given q a larger Q goal gives rise to a higher oscillation frequency; this is consistent with our observation in <ref> [18] </ref>. In general, the ideal case of Q goal = 1 2 (Q h goal + Q l goal ) does not always hold, depending on the initial value of ff 0 , but the ff-control algorithm guarantees the relationship Q l goal Q goal Q h goal to hold.
