Abstract: In this paper, we describe a rate of speech estimator that is derived directly from the acoustic signal. This measure has been developed as an alternative to lexical measures of speaking rate such as phones or syllables per second, which, in previous work, we estimated using a first recognition pass; the accuracy of our earlier lexical rate estimate depended on the quality of recognition. Here we show that our new measure is a good predictor of word error rate, and in addition, correlates moderately well with lexical speech rate. We also show that a simple modification of the model transition probabilities based on this measure can reduce the error rate almost as much as using lexical phones per second calculated from manually transcribed data. When we categorized test utterances based on speaking rate thresholds computed from the training set, we observed that a different transition probability value was required to minimize the error rate in each speaking rate bin. However, the reduction of error provided by this approach is still small in comparison with the increases in error observed for unusually fast or slow speech.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we have implemented a preliminary recognition strategy in which we only modify the transition probabilities of a hybrid system given the rate estimate, and have observed results for the Numbers corpus. 2. SIGNAL ANALYSIS Previous work <ref> [2] </ref> has demonstrated that the speech signal is significantly altered for varying speaking rates. The most obvious change to the speech, however, is the variation in the energy envelope. In other words, the energy envelope of the speech simply has more rapid change when the speaking rate is higher.

Reference-contexts: For difficult problems such as the recognition of conversational speech, performance may be too poor for this to be a reliable technique. One solution to this problem is to try to estimate phone boundaries without using a full rec ognizer; for instance, Verhasselt and Martens <ref> [5] </ref> employed a multi-layer perceptron approach with measurable success on the TIMIT database. However, in conversational speech common phonetic units corresponding to allophones or allophone segments may be significantly transformed or even disappear, and so may not be reliable measures of speaking rate.
