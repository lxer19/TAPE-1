Abstract: As the Internet has grown in size and popularity, the Internet medium has changed from an educational and technical content to a social and entertainment content. The Lycos search service estimates that the number of WWW pages has grown from 5 million to 6.89 million pages during the months of April to June of 1995, and will reach 10 million pages by 1996. A large number of these pages are devoted to personal pages, whereas only a few years ago personal pages were nonexistent. Similarly, the EFnet Internet Relay Chat (IRC) servers have grown from supporting several hundred concurrent users in 1991 to over 20,000 concurrent users in 1996. Both the WWW and IRC are becoming active vehicles of socialization and entertainment. This paper focuses on the technical and social aspects of a set of games designed by the authors that run on IRC, and how AI techniques implemented in the game impacts the participants. In particular, we examine the game Risky Business, an online trivia game hosted by a computer program or bot, short for robot. In addition to providing entertainment, the computer game show host also supports a unique setting that real-life game show hosts never encounter: the opportunity to interact in real-time with thousands of players, 24 hours a day, and become a cornerstone of their social interaction in cyberspace. In this paper we report how the behavior exhibited by the game show bot has a sociological effect on the participants. as unix, sex, or chocolate). As with virtual worlds where users take on the persona of their avatars, in the IRC world users take on a new persona or emphasize part of their existing persona or interests, as specified through their nickname. Because IRC is more textually based, it may be that there is less room for the created fantasy personalities purported to typify graphical multiuser environments as specified through their nickname. Within the domain of IRC, we have created several challenging trivia games. The focus of this paper is the game Risky Business (or RiskyBus) which is a Jeopardy! style trivia game in which users attempt to be the first to answer trivia questions in order to win virtual money and virtual prizes (Quittner, 1995; Sandberg, 1994). The game is hosted by a computer agent or bot programmed in C that communicates with IRC servers just like a human client. On EFnet servers, the host is named RobBot and on Qnet servers, the hostess is named ReneeBot. In order to host the games, the bots require knowledge regarding IRC commands, knowledge regarding how the game is played, rules and etiquette to maintain the channel, and knowledge for self-preservation within the IRC environment. In the event that the bot makes an error, human operators are capable of correcting the game. The bot also records individual player statistics such as the number of games won, and the high scores. In addition to this knowledge, the bots also project distinct personalities through ELIZA-like responses to user input (Weizenbaum, 1965). This knowledge must currently be input by a human operator. A popular type of reply are witty or humorous statements about a specific player's interests.
