Abstract: Palatalized articulation (PA) is frequently observed in speech uttered by postoperative cleft palate patients. We analyzed the PA of [s] sounds and tested human perception of certain synthetic sounds to verify the characteristics of the PA of [s] sounds in Japanese. After analyzing the PA of [s] with linear predictive (LP) analysis, the mono-syllable /sa/, /su/ and /se/ were synthesized by an all-pole model. To synthesize the fricatives, we shifted the frequency of a complex-conjugate pole pair of a filter from 1000 to 3400 Hz. A perceptual experiment involving three speech therapists was carried out to analyze perception of the three syllables. From the results we concluded that fricatives having a peak around 1800 Hz tend to be identified as the PA of [s].

If we can find an acoustic cue signaling PA, it will help speech therapists to diagnose PA non-invasively and objectively.

Okazaki [8] has reported on spectrum characteristics of the PA of [s], using a sound spectrograph for the acoustic analysis: 1) the highest peak of energy for [s] sounds were at 2 - 3 kHz in most cases of the PA group, and over 5 kHz in the normal articulation group; 2) <p> An additional peak around 2 kHz seems to characterize the PA of [s]. This peak was not observed in the spectra of the normal articulation of [s]. The frequencies of the peaks are located around 2 kHz, which is consistent with results obtained in a previous study <ref> [8] </ref>. 4. SYNTHESIS OF FRICATIVES An eighth-order all-pole model was used to synthesize fricatives in the main experiment. The pole locations in the z-plane are shown in Fig. 2; the frequency and the bandwidth of each pole are listed in Table 1.

Reference-contexts: Wakumoto <ref> [9] </ref> has reported that the PA of [s] and the normal articulation of [s] was distinguishable by the differences between high (5.0 - 7.5 kHz) and low (1.5 - 4.0 kHz) sub-band level on the consonant spectrum envelope.

Reference-contexts: In fact, we needed zeros to synthesize fricative sounds, because the noise source of the sounds is located at the anterior portion of the oral cavity <ref> [12] </ref>. Our results, however, show that the all-pole model yields a sufficient filter to synthesize the PA of [s] sounds. The samples which do not have the pole pair around 2kHz have been selected as the normal articulation of [s] sounds.
