Reference-contexts: This measure fulfills the 4 step model given above, yet obviously is not a measure of program complexity. Before you propose a new measure, make sure it has some independent basis (either empirical data <ref> [1] </ref> or a theoretical basis [2]) for its development and doesn't have the defects of the E metric. Ideally the paper should present enough data so that others may duplicate the conditions of the experiment and test whether they can achieve the same results.
