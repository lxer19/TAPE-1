Abstract: Utility theory offers an elegant and powerful theoretical framework for design and analysis of autonomous adaptive communication networks. Routing of messages in such networks presents a real-time instance of a multi-criterion optimization problem in a dynamic and uncertain environment. In this paper, we incrementally develop a set of heuristic decision functions that can be used to guide messages along a near-optimal (e.g., minimum delay) path in a large network. We present an analysis of properties of such heuristics under a set of simplifying assumptions about the network topology and load dynamics and identify the conditions under which they are guaranteed to route messages along an optimal path. The paper concludes with a discussion of the relevance of the theoretical results presented in the paper to the design of intelligent autonomous adaptive communication networks and an outline of some directions of future research.

Reference-contexts: Motivated by these considerations, a class of adaptive heuristic routing algorithms have been developed over the past few years <ref> (Mikler, Wong, & Honavar 1994) </ref>. Experiments demonstrate that such algorithms have a number of interesting properties including: automatic load balancing and message delay minimization. The work described in this paper is a step toward the development of a theoretical framework for the design and the analysis of such heuristics. <p> Ideally, it must ade quately summarize the load values in large regions of the network as viewed from a given node. These considerations (among others) led us to define a view, V k , which is maintained in every node in the network <ref> (Mikler, Wong, & Honavar 1994) </ref>. In a rectangular grid network, this view consists of four components, one for each of the four directions - north, south, east, and west.

Reference-contexts: Introduction With the unprecedented growth in size and and complexity of communication networks, the development of intelligent and adaptive approaches to network management (including such functions as routing, congestion control, etc.) have assumed considerable theoretical as well as practical significance. Knowledge representation and heuristic techniques <ref> (Pearl 1984) </ref> of artificial intelligence, utility-theoretic methods of decision theory, as well as techniques of adaptive control offer a broad range of powerful tools for the design of intelligent, adaptive, and autonomous communication networks. This paper develops and analyzes some utility-theoretic heuristics for adaptive routing in large communication networks. <p> It would be useful to analyze different estimators and the resulting heuristics - especially since the design of good heuristics for complex problems is commonly based on solution of simplified or relaxed versions of the original problem <ref> (Pearl 1984) </ref>. Other interesting research directions include the investigation of methods for adaptation or tuning of heuristics in real-time.
