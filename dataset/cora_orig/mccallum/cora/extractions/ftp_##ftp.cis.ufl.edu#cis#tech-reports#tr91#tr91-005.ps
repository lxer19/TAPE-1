Abstract: Computer animation is a discipline that has traditional roots within the computer graphics community. Our work shows that discrete event methods within computer simulation can play an important role in helping to organize animations. We discuss an animation of several articulated figures |the dining philosophers scenario| via the control afforded by discrete event modeling and simulation. We have found that multiple models consisting of discrete event and continuous components can provide an easier to understand description of a complex system.

Reference-contexts: It is often awkward for a human to specify the animation in terms of physical parameters (Witkin and Kass 1988; Armstrong and Green 1985). In other instances, a system may have been designed only for a special case <ref> (Bruderlein 1988) </ref>. Thus, there still remains more research to be done in generating an easy-to-use, general animation system. 4 INTEGRATING SIMULATION AND ANIMATION integrating our computer simulation with the traditional keyframe animation system. 4.1 Modeling First we begin with the simulator (stage 1).

Reference-contexts: Usually this is done by interpolating between the configurations with a spline curve algorithm. The most popular splines in computer animation are the Catmul-Rom (1974), the Cardinal (Smith 1983), and the Hermite Spline <ref> (Doris and Kochanek 1984) </ref> because, unlike other types, they actually pass through the control points. At the present time, keyframe systems are the most widely used type of animation system.

Reference-contexts: For instance, the familiar barbershop model contains entities (people) that move through the system (shop) using two events: "arrival" and "departure." Figure 1 displays the process of modeling and simulating a barbershop. In fig. 1, The input to a simulation system such as SimPack <ref> (Fishwick 1990) </ref> is the graph model specification. Models such as the barber shop model are constructed from queuing networks, and queuing networks are a form of procedural, data flow modeling where the barber (server) accepts entities (data) that flow through the system. <p> We use a set of tools called SimPack. SimPack <ref> (Fishwick 1990) </ref> permits the following types of modeling: * Finite state automaton with timed states. * Markov chain modeling. * Queuing networks. * Differential, difference equation and delay differ ential equation modeling. * Pulse processes. * Stochastic Petri networks. * Bi-directional message passing networks. * Parallel network simulation with the Linda

Reference-contexts: Specifically, XKEY provides: * A capability for loading, storing and creating keyframes. * Denavit-Hartenberg notation (1955) which is used for setting up the articulation linkage and their associated degrees of freedom (DOF). * An interactive method for moving objects or sub objects with respect to their DOF. * A multi-track <ref> (Gomez 1985) </ref> coordinator that in cludes cut, copy and paste of frames. * Cubic spline and linear interpolation of keyframe DOF variables. The models used are polygon based, and were created by using a CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) approach where spheres are combined to form the limbs.

Reference-contexts: However, some methods require less user interaction than others and are, therefore, more powerful.

Reference-contexts: The keyframe technique is an extension of how traditional cell animation <ref> (White 1988) </ref> is done in 2D animation. In cell animation, the most talented artists draw the figures at "key" positions (ie., start and finish), TR91-005 Computer and Information Sciences, University of Florida 3 and other animators fill in the in-between pictures.

Reference-contexts: We are currently investigating the following three methods: * Constrain the dynamics to follow the spline path exactly (Girard 1991; Wilhelms 1987). * Constrain the dynamics to follow a path to some * tolerance. This is often achieved through the use of spring-like forces attached to the path <ref> (Witkin, Fleischer and Barr 1987) </ref>. * Constrain dynamics to pass through or near the keyframe points and use a method such as optimal control to obtain the path achieved by min imizing potential energy. Obtaining fast physical object responses within an easy-to-use animation system is an active research problem.
