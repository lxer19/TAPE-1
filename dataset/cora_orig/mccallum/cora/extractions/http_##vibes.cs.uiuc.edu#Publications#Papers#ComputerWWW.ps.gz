Abstract: The World Wide Web (WWW) server at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) is one of the most heavily accessed WWW servers in the world. This server is based on a collection of cooperating hosts that share a common file system. To increase our understanding of how users access this server and to provide a basis for assessing server and system software optimizations, we analyzed NCSA's server logs for multiple weeks during a five month period. This paper describes the server's architecture, presents the results of our access pattern analysis, and discusses the implications for server design and extensibility. fl An extended version of this paper has been submitted for possible publication in the proceedings of Supercomputing '95.

Reference-contexts: Data-type specific caching algorithms are one potential solution. 2.3 Round-Robin Domain Name System The third and final component of the NCSA scalable WWW server is a modified network name resolver based on the Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) code <ref> [1] </ref>. The existing BIND 4.9.2 code has a "round-robin" option that can associate a single domain name with several IP addresses. In response to requests, these addresses are distributed using a simple rotation algorithm.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The recent explosion of interest in the World Wide Web (WWW) <ref> [2] </ref> can be traced to the distribution of the CERN (European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva, Switzerland) and NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing Applications) servers and WWW client browsers.

Reference-contexts: time, the WWW servers at NCSA have experienced explosive growth in traffic, from one million requests per week in February 1994, to two million per week in June 1994, three million per week in September 1994, nearly four million per week in December 1994, and even larger numbers in 1995 <ref> [3] </ref>. To support continued growth, WWW servers must manage a multi-gigabyte (in some instances a multi-terabyte) data base of multimedia information, while concurrently serving multiple request streams. This places demands on the servers' underlying operating systems and file systems that lie far outside today's normal operating regime. <p> End Sidebar 2 NCSA WWW Server Architecture The single most notable aspect of WWW traffic is its phenomenal growth rate. At NCSA, the traffic has grown from one million requests per week in February 1994 to nearly four million per week in December 1994 <ref> [3] </ref>, with little prospect of a decline in the growth rate. 1 NCSA Mosaic is a trademark of the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois. 3 Shortly after NCSA's WWW server was established, it became clear that the volume of WWW traffic would stress operating systems and network implementations

Reference-contexts: To meet increasing demand, NCSA will continue to add servers as needed. Below, we briefly describe each of the three server components. For additional details on the server architecture, see Katz et al <ref> [4] </ref> and Kwan et al [5]. 2 The Andrew File System is a product of Transarc Corporation. 4 Begin Sidebar: Scalable Server Architecture Development of the NCSA architecture required resolution of three key problems. 1. Information addressing: Externally, the NCSA server has a single domain name (www.ncsa.uiuc.edu). <p> In response to requests, these addresses are distributed using a simple rotation algorithm. Because this rotation conflicted with extant software at NCSA, the BIND software was modified to only rotate specific addresses, namely those of the WWW servers; see <ref> [4] </ref> for details. The modified domain name system (DNS) allows a domain name with more than one associated IP address to be specified as "round-robin." Each incoming request for the address of a round-robin domain name is satisfied with the next IP address on the list in a simple rotation.

However, the specific characteristics of this growth and the sources of requests are much less well understood.

Reference-contexts: These data are collected continuously on each server and are permanently archived each day to be available for researchers. Collectively, they constitute more than 150 megabytes of data each weekday <ref> [6] </ref>! On each of the component WWW servers, the data collected includes * the standard access logs from the NCSA HTTP daemons (httpd), * the standard error logs from the httpd daemons, * a custom log of the client browser type (the "user agent") that initiated each request, * a trace

Reference-contexts: The FDDI ring connects to the rest of NCSA and, via a T3 line, to the Internet. 2.2 NCSA AFS Configuration All documents provided by the NCSA WWW service are served from the NCSA, center-wide Andrew File System (AFS) environment <ref> [7] </ref>. This distributed file system is shared by many hundreds of client workstations and supercomputers, as well as the WWW servers. AFS provides a single, consistent view of the file system to each WWW server, allowing each server to access all of the WWW document tree.

Reference-contexts: This problem is exacerbated by the fact that a document may be composed of several pieces, each of which is fetched separately, with each fetch requiring a separate TCP/IP connection. Padmanabhan and Mogul <ref> [8] </ref> have proposed opening a single TCP connection per HTML document to avoid unnecessary TCP overhead; preliminary experiments show that this reduces document retrieval latency. Spero [12] has proposed a new protocol, HTTP-NG, which dramatically alters HTTP to reduce overhead, allow more parallelism, and efficiently support features such as authentication.

Reference-contexts: At the moment, various browsers caches data on local client disks to improve performance. Pitkow and Recker <ref> [9] </ref> have shown that caching based on recent rates of past access is an effective technique. However, to design and implement effective prefetching, one must first study and understand the extant access patterns. Our data suggests that partitioned caches are a promising alternative.

Reference-contexts: However, to understand the dynamics of server behavior and the interactions of request patterns with round-robin DNS system, we exploited the local availability of the CAVE, an immersive, unencumbered virtual environment, and our Avatar visualization software <ref> [10] </ref>, to create dynamic displays of server behavior. Figure 3 shows a snapshot of this visualization from a "day in the life" of the NCSA WWW server. 8 In the figure, the trajectories of four different servers in the performance metric space are denoted by the four colored ribbons.

Reference-contexts: Though the servers operate independently, they collectively provide the illusion of a single server. The server architecture is based on three components: (1) a collection of independent servers, (2) a WWW document tree shared among the servers and stored by the Andrew (AFS flR ) 2 <ref> [11] </ref> distributed file system, and (3) a round-robin domain name system (DNS) that multiplexes the domain name www.ncsa.uiuc.edu among the constituent servers. With this architecture, the NCSA WWW service is always the same, although the number and identity of the particular servers may change from day to day.
