Reference-contexts: For each face of a reflector visible from the light source, the subtended solid angle is traced outward until it reaches a non-specular surface, where radiant power is deposited. For curved specular surfaces, backward ray tracing (also called light-ray or illumination-ray tracing) provides an approximate solution <ref> [Arvo86, Heckbert90, Shirley90] </ref>. In this method, rays are cast stochastically from the light source, like individual photons, reflecting through the scene until striking a non-specular surface. Shirley has produced some of the most impressive photorealistic images to date with this method (e.g., Figure 7 in [Shirley90]).

Reference-contexts: This observation has the potential for speeding up the program enormously. Also, the shapes of the caustics themselves are very interesting. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the types of caustics and the types of singularities, or catastrophes, produced by a function and its gradient map <ref> [Berry80] </ref>. Producing mathematical visualizations of such functions would be extremely interesting to mathematical physicists.

Reference-contexts: point on a ray to another as the geometric path length weighted by the refractive index of the media: S (t) = h dt A surface of constant S (relative to some source point) is called a geometrical wavefront, which is always perpendicular to the light rays passing through it <ref> [Born80] </ref>. In homogeneous media, light rays travel in straight lines; and if there are regions of constant refractive index separated by smooth boundaries, then rays will travel along piecewise straight paths reflecting or refracting at boundaries. In a medium with smoothly varying refractive index, rays would be curved.

Reference-contexts: In Section 5.1 we discuss a method for efficiently computing these derivatives at a point using automatic differentiation. In Plate 1, colors code the Gaussian curvature of a quartic surface computed using these techniques. Similar illustrations have been produced by [For-rest79] and <ref> [Dill81] </ref> for parametric surfaces. Plate 1. Gaussian Curvature We now return to the task of tracing a wavefront along a ray path.

Reference-contexts: The wavefront is now traced through the system. This involves three operations: Transfer Reflection Refraction The equations describing the evolution of the wavefront for each of these situations were originally derived in 1906 by Gullstrand <ref> [Gullstrand06] </ref>, and more recently using modern notation by Kneisly [Kneisly64] and Stavroudis [Stavroudis72]. The equations of transfer are simplest: k v = k v _ ______ 1 - dk u where d is the distance the wavefront moves.

We must estimate the distribution of radiant power from photon locations and density. This problem has been discussed by Heckbert <ref> [Heckbert90] </ref>. This is a troublesome problem which has not been completely solved. The method we propose will compute irradiance values at locations of our choosing, and thus avoids both of these problems. 2.

Reference-contexts: The second group of interpreters operates on intervals. A first machine in this group computes an interval extension of g and an interval extension of the directional derivative g /t along a ray. This stack machine is used by the ray/surface intersection routines as described in <ref> [Mitchell90] </ref>. A second machine computes interval extensions of g and its gradient g, and a third machine computes these as well as an interval extension of the Hessian matrix for g. These two machines are used to compute the Krawczyk operator (8) during the root isolation phase. 7.

Reference-contexts: It also can be extended to sim-ulataneously compute higher order derivatives. 5.2. Interval Arithmetic An alternative number system can be defined, based on interval numbers. A number of powerful numerical techniques are based on interval arithmetic <ref> [Moore79] </ref>, and some of these techniques have been applied to problems in computer graphics [Toth85,Mitchell90]. An interval number corresponds to a range of real values and can be represented by a pair of numbers [a, b], the lower and upper bounds of the interval. <p> Suppose we are attempting to solve a system of N equations in N unknowns, f (x) = 0. Ordinary Newton's method does not provide a reliable way to locate every solution within a given region, but interval extensions have been developed which do <ref> [Moore79] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We could compute a finite-difference approximation to the derivative, but this yields poor numerical accuracy. An alternative is to evaluate the pair of numbers f (x 0 ) and f x (x 0 ) concurrently <ref> [Rall81] </ref>. For constant f = c, this pair will be (c, 0 ), and for f = x, the value/derivative pair is simply (x 0 , 1 ). Starting from there, a formula for f can be evaluated by performing operations on these pairs of numbers.

Reference-contexts: Two approaches have been used previously to simulate specularly reflected and refracted illumination. If the reflectors and refractors are polyhedral, illumination can be computed by backward beam tracing <ref> [Shinya87, Shinya89, Watt90] </ref>. For each face of a reflector visible from the light source, the subtended solid angle is traced outward until it reaches a non-specular surface, where radiant power is deposited.

The primary difficulties with backward ray tracing involve sampling and estimating the distribution of radiant power (irradiance). Illumination rays arrive at their final destinations in a nonuniform pattern; and if they gave us samples of irradiance, we would have some difficulty with nonuniform interpolation.

Reference-contexts: We believe that cost of solving for ellipse-surface tangency has roughly the same complexity as line-surface intersection, and, hence, can be significantly sped up. An important application of this technique that we have yet to explore is the calculation of extended form factors <ref> [Sparrow62] </ref>. A form factor between two surface elements is defined to be the percentage of light leaving one element that impinges directly on the other. An extended form factor includes light traveling via intermediate specular surfaces. Fermat path tracing finds all the paths between the two surface elements explicitly.

Reference-contexts: Methods for performing (i) are derived from classical differential geometry (For example [Struik61]); methods for performing (ii) are derived from classical geometrical optics (For example <ref> [Stavroudis72] </ref>). More details (particularly the derivations) of the results used this section are available in the quoted references. The local properties of a surface can be derived by computing its derivatives in different directions. <p> The wavefront is now traced through the system.

This calculation can be found on pp. 149-157 of <ref> [Stavroudis72] </ref>; only the results are stated here.

Reference-contexts: The implementation requires (i) tools to analyze the differential geometry of wavefronts and surfaces, and (ii) functions that transform the wavefront as it is transferred through homogeneous media and as it reflects and refracts from a surface. Methods for performing (i) are derived from classical differential geometry (For example <ref> [Struik61] </ref>); methods for performing (ii) are derived from classical geometrical optics (For example [Stavroudis72]). More details (particularly the derivations) of the results used this section are available in the quoted references. The local properties of a surface can be derived by computing its derivatives in different directions. <p> Formulas for curvature are usually stated in terms of derivatives of parametric surfaces (see e.g. <ref> [Struik61] </ref>).

If the reflectors and refractors are polyhedral, illumination can be computed by backward beam tracing <ref> [Shinya87, Shinya89, Watt90] </ref>. For each face of a reflector visible from the light source, the subtended solid angle is traced outward until it reaches a non-specular surface, where radiant power is deposited. <p> The combination of the two techniques allows us to calculate directly the illumination via virtual lights at any point in the scene. The intensity law has been used in the two-pass rendering algorithms developed by Shinya and Takahashi [Shinya87,Shinya89] and by Watt <ref> [Watt90] </ref>. What is novel about our approach is that we avoid the second pass, and hence the problem of resampling the light rays by the eye rays. We also formulate the intensity calculation in a way suitable for ray tracing programs.

Reference-contexts: The visible (i.e., closest) surface intersection is found by geometrical and numerical methods, and the radiance (watts meter - 2 steradian - 1 ) at that visible point is calculated according some shading model. Whitted's shading model extends the notion of visibility by simulating reflecting and refracting surfaces <ref> [Whitted80] </ref>. A visual ray that encounters a reflective surface is bounced off the surface and continues in the direction of reflection (see Figure 1). Eventually, it will encounter a non-reflecting surface, and the shading calculation is performed.
