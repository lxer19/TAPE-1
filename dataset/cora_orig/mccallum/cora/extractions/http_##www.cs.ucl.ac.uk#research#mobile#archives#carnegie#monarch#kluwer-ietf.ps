Title: Scalable Support for Transparent Mobile Host Internetworking  
Author: David B. Johnson

Affiliation: Computer Science Department Carnegie Mellon University  
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of providing transparent support for very large numbers of mobile hosts within a large internetwork such as the Internet. The availability of powerful mobile computing devices and wireless networking products and services is increasing dramatically, but internetworking protocols such as IP used in the Internet do not currently support host movement. To address this need, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is currently developing protocols for mobile hosts in the Internet. This paper analyzes the problem to be solved, reviews the current state of that effort, and discusses its scalability to very large numbers of mobile hosts in a large internetwork.

This scheme relies on a general property of routing in the Internet in which nodes not connected to the normal routing path of a packet cannot eavesdrop on or reroute that packet.

Reference-contexts: The original two-level hierarchy of Internet addressing in IP has already been transparently extended at the bottom with subnetting [16] and at the top through use of CIDR [5]. In the IETF's IPng effort to develop the next generation of the IP protocol <ref> [2] </ref>, support for many more levels of hierarchy than in the present version of IP is an explicit design goal [15]. However, this hierarchy in addressing and routing prevents packets from being routed correctly to a mobile host while it is away from its home network.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, either function or both may be provided by any of the existing IP routers on a network, or they may be provided by separate support hosts on that network. 3.2. Agent Discovery The agent discovery protocol operates as a compatible extension of the existing ICMP router discovery protocol <ref> [3] </ref>. It provides a means for a mobile host to detect when it has moved from one network to another, and for it to detect when it has returned home.

Reference-contexts: The foreign agent acts as a local forwarder for packets arriving for the mobile host and for all other locally visiting mobile hosts registered with this foreign agent. Alternatively, if the mobile host can obtain a temporary local address within the network being visited (such as through DHCP <ref> [4] </ref>), the mobile host may use this temporary address as its care-of address. While a mobile host is away from its home network, a mobile host's home agent acts to forward all packets for the mobile host to its current location for delivery locally to the mobile host.

Reference-contexts: Hierarchical addressing and routing has proven to be essential to keep up with the exponential growth of the Internet, in particular.

Reference-contexts: This type of encapsulation may be used for tunneling any packet, but the overhead for this method is the addition of an entire new IP header (20 bytes) to the packet.

Reference-contexts: as any IP packets sent to an ordinary stationary host that has never been mobile. 12 It thus becomes feasible to upgrade all hosts, at any convenient time, to be mobile capable, with no performance penalty to the network or to the host for the extra capability of being mobile <ref> [11] </ref>. Any mobile capable host could then become mobile at any future time as needed simply by leaving its home network and registering elsewhere.

Reference-contexts: This functionality has become known within the IETF as route optimization, and a group consisting of Andrew Myles of Macquarie University, Charles Perkins of IBM, and the author have been working particularly to develop this functionality within the IETF protocol <ref> [14] </ref>. This section provides an overview of the current state of the protocol extensions for route optimization. 4.1. Location Caching Any node may optimize its own communication with mobile hosts by maintaining a binding cache in which it caches the binding of one or more mobile hosts. <p> A number of restricted authentication schemes for route optimization are possible in the short term, however, before the necessary protocols and infrastructure are available. The route optimization extensions within the IETF <ref> [14] </ref> have currently been designed to utilize manually configured shared secret keys in the same way as the authentication used in registration in the basic Mobile IP protocol, but the required shared keys may be configured to reduce the number of pairwise keys that must be maintained.

Problem Analysis 2.1. Internetwork Routing In order to provide scalable routing support, internetworking protocols such as IP <ref> [23] </ref>, ISO CLNP [27], NetWare IPX [33], and AppleTalk [28], use hierarchical addressing and routing schemes. <p> This type of packet forwarding is known as tunneling. For IP, tunneling may in general be done using an encapsulation protocol or through an IP option such as loose source routing <ref> [23] </ref>. In tunneling a packet from one node to another, only these two nodes (the two endpoints of the tunnel) need know that tunneling is taking place.

Reference-contexts: Packets addressed to the mobile host that appear on the mobile host's home network must be intercepted by the mobile host's home agent, for example by using proxy ARP <ref> [24] </ref> or through cooperation with the local routing protocol in use on the home network. For each such packet intercepted, the home agent tunnels the packet to the mobile host's current care-of address.

MD5 is a one-way hash function, in that it is considered to be computationally infeasible to discover the input to the hash function given its output, or to find another sequence of input that produces the same output.
