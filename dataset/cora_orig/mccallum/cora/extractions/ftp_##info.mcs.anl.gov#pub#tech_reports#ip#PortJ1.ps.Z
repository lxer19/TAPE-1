Title: A truncated Newton interior-point algorithm for the solution of a multicommodity spatial equilibrium model  
Author: Luis Portugal Luis Fernandes Joaquim Judice 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a Truncated Newton (TN) interior-point algorithm for solving monotone linear complementarity problems. Contrary to the usual Newton interior-point methods that use exact Newton directions, this algorithm computes at each iteration an approximate Newton direction by employing appropriate preconditioned iterative linear system solvers. The stopping criterion used in these iterative procedures is defined in terms of the norm of the residual vector associated to the linear constraints and guarantes global convergence for the TN interior-point algorithm. We describe an efficient implementation of this algorithm for solving the Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) associated to the symmetric and nonsymmetric multicommodity spatial equilibrium problems. The Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) or the Preconditioned Quasi Minimal Residual (PQMR) algorithms are incorporated in the implementation depending on the matrix of the LCP to be symmetric or nonsymmetric. We also describe an incomplete QR factorization preconditioning technique which greatly improves the convergence properties of the PCG and PQMR algorithms. Finally, the stopping criterion of the TN algorithm exploits the stucture of the network model and leads to an exact solution for the LCP. We report extensive computational experience that shows the great efficiency of the approach discussed in this paper.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, Variant 1 requires the computation of m spanning trees. This task is carried out using the Fibonacci heap variant of Prim's algorithm [28] described in <ref> [1] </ref>. This implementation of Prim's algorithm finds a maximum spanning tree in O (n (n 1)=2 + nlog (n)) time. 19 Variant 2. This variant of the IQRD technique is used in the initial iterations of the TN method. <p> In this procedure we use the TN algorithm to solve a perturbed LCP where the elements of the cost coefficients vector c are defined by c ijg = c ijg (1 + ffi ijg "), where ffi ijg is a uniform random number in the interval <ref> [1; 1] </ref> and " is a small perturbation. This technique is far from being perfect, despite being, as much as we know, the most effective device for preventing degeneracy effects in practice. If " is too small, then usually the perturbed problem is still degenerate.

In fact, the bulk of the interior-point algorithms is the computation at each iteration of a search direction by solving one or two systems of linear equations. <p> The idea behind the truncated optimization algorithms is to derive a stopping criterion to the iterative linear system solvers that minimizes the computational effort involved in computing search directions that guarantee global convergence [5, 6]. Recently, Portugal et al. <ref> [27] </ref> introduced a globally convergent truncated Newton interior-point algorithm for linear programming. The practical version of this algorithm for the linear minimum cost network flow problem, PDNET, has proven to be competitive with the sate-of-the-art network flow codes. <p> As stated in <ref> [18, 27] </ref>, global convergence for the TN method is guaranteed if we choose the stepsize ff k such that ff k 2]0; 1] and (x k+1 ; z k+1 ) 2 N ; with ff k the maximum value of ~ff, 0 ~ff 1, such that the conditions (x k ; <p> 1 + U H S W k S L = D 1 + U R &gt; Q &gt; Q RL: Since Q is orthogonal, Q &gt; Q = I and we have D 1 + U H S W k S L (=)D 1 + U R &gt; RL: In <ref> [27, 31, 29, 30, 34] </ref> the choice of an appropriate sparsity structure for the preconditioners of a matrix of the form (W k S g ) 2 G &gt; T g is discussed in the context of linear network flow programming.

Reference-contexts: As stated in <ref> [29] </ref>, the choice of algorithm, preconditioners and method for recovering an exact solution to the problem are the key ingredients to achieve an efficient interior-point code for network flow problems. <p> In the general case, the algorithm incorporates a sparse direct solver for this purpose.

The idea behind the truncated optimization algorithms is to derive a stopping criterion to the iterative linear system solvers that minimizes the computational effort involved in computing search directions that guarantee global convergence [5, 6]. <p> 1 + U H S W k S L = D 1 + U R &gt; Q &gt; Q RL: Since Q is orthogonal, Q &gt; Q = I and we have D 1 + U H S W k S L (=)D 1 + U R &gt; RL: In <ref> [27, 31, 29, 30, 34] </ref> the choice of an appropriate sparsity structure for the preconditioners of a matrix of the form (W k S g ) 2 G &gt; T g is discussed in the context of linear network flow programming.

Reference-contexts: We have conducted several computational experiments for comparing this initialization with other choices for the vector (x 0 ; z 0 ) reported in <ref> [8, 32] </ref>. The results support the use of this starting point with " = 0:1 in the particular case of the LCP (3).

Reference-contexts: The matrix B is assumed to be positive definite (not necessarily symmetric) <ref> [23, 33] </ref>, whence the matrix J &gt; BJ is positive semi-definite of order mn (n 1). Therefore the LCP (3) is monotone. Single and block SOR algorithms are the most common procedures suggested in the literature for the solution of the LCP (3) [14, 23].
