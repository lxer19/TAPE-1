Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) is often preferred over Filtered Backprojection (FBP) methods for the 2D (3D) reconstruction from projections when the projections are sparse, noisy, or non-uniformly distributed <ref> [1] </ref>. Routine clinical CT does not usually suffer from these conditions, and thus the faster FBP methods are used exclusively in this setting. However, these conditions do exist in other medical imaging applications. For instance, reconstruction from noisy PET data has shown promising results [2].

Reference-contexts: Routine clinical CT does not usually suffer from these conditions, and thus the faster FBP methods are used exclusively in this setting. However, these conditions do exist in other medical imaging applications. For instance, reconstruction from noisy PET data has shown promising results <ref> [2] </ref>. In addition, ART, and other iterative methods, have enjoyed great interest in recent years due to their ability to incorporate into the reconstruction procedure a proper model of the projection process, as is needed in SPECT (see e.g. [3]).

Reference-contexts: In addition, ART, and other iterative methods, have enjoyed great interest in recent years due to their ability to incorporate into the reconstruction procedure a proper model of the projection process, as is needed in SPECT (see e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>). Certain constraints, such as object shape and non-negativity, can also be imposed. This proves helpful in some prototype CT applications such as 3D angiography [4]. In ART, the object to be reconstructed is embedded in a regular discrete 2D (3D) pixel grid.

Reference-contexts: Certain constraints, such as object shape and non-negativity, can also be imposed. This proves helpful in some prototype CT applications such as 3D angiography <ref> [4] </ref>. In ART, the object to be reconstructed is embedded in a regular discrete 2D (3D) pixel grid. The reconstruction problem can then be formulated as a system of linear equations: (1) where N is the number of grid pixels and R is the total number of projection rays.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a method devised by Gordon, Bender, and Herman <ref> [5] </ref> is commonly used: Iteratively, for each projection image ray (selected in a certain order), the grid is projected, the projection is compared with the corresponding ray value in the acquired projection image, and a correction term is computed and backprojected onto the grid.

Reference-contexts: Ideally, each backprojection updates the grid to correspond more closely to the acquired projection data. The iterative process is terminated when some error or convergence-rate threshold is reached. It was shown by Andersen and Kak <ref> [6] </ref> that noise-like artifacts in the reconstruction can be reduced if the grid is corrected only once per projection image and not for every projection ray. This discovery gave rise to SART (Simultaneous ART), an algorithm that we have adopted for our implementation as well.

Reference-contexts: It is thus the goal of ART to converge to the solution that represents the closest approximation to the object function from which the projection images were obtained. In this respect, it has been known for quite some time (see e.g. <ref> [10] </ref>) that both the quality of the approximation and the rate of convergence of the iterative reconstruction procedure depends, among other factors, on the order in which the projections are selected for grid correction. <p> radius of 2 pixel lengths, an order m=2 to ensure a continuous derivative at the function borders, and a taper parameter a=10.80 to force the kernels frequency spectrum to a minimum at the sampling frequency.) For estimation of the reconstruction error we use the normalized root mean squared error measure <ref> [10] </ref>: Fig. 3.

Reference-contexts: For most M there is, however, no fixed angle that satisfies the criterion of maximizing the minimum angle for all 1jM-1. An alternative method that uses variable angles between subsequent projections was proposed by Herman and Meyer <ref> [11] </ref>. It is based on the prime number decomposition (PND) of M. This method, however, requires that M be non-prime. The same authors also refer to work performed by van Dijke [14] who concluded that, among all schemes he tried, a random projection permutation gave the best results. <p> Results Table 1 gives the projection access orders for all six ordering schemes discussed in the previous sections (M=30): Sequential Access (SAS), Fixed Angle at 66.0 (FAS), Prime Number Decomposition (PND) <ref> [11] </ref>, Random Access (RAS) [14], Multilevel (MLS) [12], and Weighted Distance (WDS). In order to compare all presented methods with regards to Postulate 1, we define a discrete 2D space that is spanned by the projection index number and the projection access time instance.

Reference-contexts: However, we may prefer an ordering scheme that is more controllable and deterministic than a random number generator. More recently, Guan and Gordon <ref> [12] </ref> presented, what they termed, the Multilevel Access Scheme (MLS). This method works best when the number of projections is a power of 2, but can also be 5 used, with minor modifications, in the general case. <p> Results Table 1 gives the projection access orders for all six ordering schemes discussed in the previous sections (M=30): Sequential Access (SAS), Fixed Angle at 66.0 (FAS), Prime Number Decomposition (PND) [11], Random Access (RAS) [14], Multilevel (MLS) <ref> [12] </ref>, and Weighted Distance (WDS).

Reference-contexts: A smooth transition between iterations is warranted if the selection scheme is continuous across iteration boundaries. Denoting M as the total number of projections in the set and 0jM-1 to be the number of projections already applied, Hamaker and Solmon <ref> [13] </ref> demonstrate in a fundamental treatment that a good permutation t of the ordering of the M projections is obtained when the minimum angle among (t (l)-t (k))180/M, 0lj, 0kj, lk is maximized for each j. Postulate 1 could be regarded as a more heuristic interpretation of this finding.

Reference-contexts: Table 2 also shows that WDS behaves equally well in both categories, access uniformity and cluster-freeness, where it is better or at least as good as any other method investigated. Finally, we tested all projection access schemes on the low-contrast Shepp-Logan phantom as described in <ref> [15] </ref> and shown in Fig. 5. 80 projections of 128 rays each were computed analytically from the mathematical description of the ellipses that make up the phantom.

Reference-contexts: WDS by design generates a different access sequence in every iteration as well, however, with the additional constraint of optimal fit with regards to the previous sequence. At this point it should also be mentioned that some authors (such as <ref> [18] </ref>) linearly increase the relaxation factor l from a small value at initial projections to a larger fixed value for use in later grid corrections. To eliminate the effects of yet another variable in the comparison process, we chose to use a fixed value of l throughout the reconstruction procedure. <p> Random access Multiresolution selection Weighted distance 12 to investigate if the method and its principles offer the same advantages also for real-life datasets, such as noisy PET or SPECT data, projection sets that are distributed non-uniformly in angle (including the limited-angle problem <ref> [18] </ref>), and very sparse datasets with 40 projections and less. It would also be interesting to investigate the effect of incorporating knowledge about the shape Fig. 5.
