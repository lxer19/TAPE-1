Reference-contexts: determine a hyperplane that minimizes the sum of the deviations of the misclassified points (Glover [6], Lee and Ord [10]), to minimize the maximum distance of a misclassified point to the hyperplane (Cavalier and al. [3], Marcotte and Savard [12]) to minimize the number of misclassified points (Banks and Abad <ref> [1] </ref>, Koehler and Erenguc [8], Soltysik and Yarnold [14], Marcotte and Savard [12]) or any combination of the previous criteria via goal programming. In the case of the non-existence of a separating hyperplane, all these problems lead to nonconvex programs.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we adopt a mathematical programming approach to this problem, and do not intend to discuss its merit over alternative approaches. For such a discussion, the reader is referred to the works of Bajgier and Hill <ref> [2] </ref>, Markowski and Markowski [13] and Stam and Joachimsthaler [15]. Within the mathematical programming framework, various discrimination functions have been proposed. <p> The algorithms have been implemented on a SUN SPARC workstation and coded using the C programming language. The linear relaxation problems occurring in both codes have been solved by the simplex optimizer CPLEX [4]. Our experimental design follows closely that of Bajgier and Hill <ref> [2] </ref> and Marcotte and Savard [12]. The points x i and y j have been generated from multivariate normal populations with variable means ( X ; Y ), variance-covariance matrices ( X ; Y ), sample sizes r, s and space dimension n.

Reference-contexts: hulls of the two sets of points X and Y intersect, one may wish to determine a hyperplane that minimizes the sum of the deviations of the misclassified points (Glover [6], Lee and Ord [10]), to minimize the maximum distance of a misclassified point to the hyperplane (Cavalier and al. <ref> [3] </ref>, Marcotte and Savard [12]) to minimize the number of misclassified points (Banks and Abad [1], Koehler and Erenguc [8], Soltysik and Yarnold [14], Marcotte and Savard [12]) or any combination of the previous criteria via goal programming. <p> The exclusion constraint can be enforced by incorporating into MIP0 the norm constraint kpk = 1 or kpk 1. In striving to minimize the maximal distance of a misclassified point to the separation hyperplane, Cavalier, Ignizio and Soyster <ref> [3] </ref> have used the Euclidian norm, leading to a reverse convex quadratic program for which they proposed a descent algorithm leading to a local solution.

Reference-contexts: Other approaches are possible. For instance, if X and Y are known to be random samples drawn from multivariate normal populations with identical variance-covariance matrices, then Fisher's discriminant hyperplane (see Fisher <ref> [5] </ref>) provides a rule that is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the probability of assigning z to the correct parent population. In this paper we adopt a mathematical programming approach to this problem, and do not intend to discuss its merit over alternative approaches.

In this paper, we choose to minimize the number of misclassifications. This results in a hard (strongly NP-hard to be precise) combinatorial problem. Koehler and Erenguc <ref> [8] </ref> have proposed a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation of this problem and have developed both an exact and a heuristic algorithm for its solution. A normalization constraint is introduced to rule out the "zero solution" and is implicitly enforced throughout the algorithm.
