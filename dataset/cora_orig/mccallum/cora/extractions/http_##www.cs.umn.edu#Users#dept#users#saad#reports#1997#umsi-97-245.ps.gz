Abstract: This paper discusses finite element solution methods for simulating unsteady three-dimensional free surface flows. Parallelization of the code is carried out using PSPARSLIB and the MPI message passing libraries. This code is used to simulate three-dimensional incompressible flows in dynamic meshes. The governing equilibrium equations are written in the framework of the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian kinematic description to which the variational formulation is applied. The fluid flow and the dynamics of the mesh are solved in a coupled fashion using Newton's method. The resulting set of nonlinear equations is solved by a robust preconditioned GMRES algorithm. Parallel implementation issues such as data structures for the finite element method using domain decomposition and their impact on iterative solvers will be discussed. Finally, the computational performance is assessed on a practical three-dimensional hydraulic problem.

Reference-contexts: PSPARSLIB is a portable library of parallel sparse iteratives solvers, whose goal is to address this need. Assume that we have a convenient partitioning of the graph, as defined by a certain node to processor mapping. A number publically available partitioners, such as METIS <ref> [2] </ref>, can be used for this purpose. Initially, we assume that each subdomain is assigned to a different processor.

Reference-contexts: Another approach is based on using a threshold strategy combined with what is referred to as the I,K,J variant of Gaussian Elimination. A sketch of the general structure of one such algorithm is described next. Details can be found in Saad <ref> [13] </ref>. Algorithm 5.2 ILUT 1. Do i=1, n 3. J i;k := J i;k =J k;k 4. If jJ i;k j is not too small then Do j = k + 1; n 6. J i;j := J i;j J i;k fl J k;j 5. EndDo 6. EndDo 7. <p> If jJ i;k j is not too small then Do j = k + 1; n 6. J i;j := J i;j J i;k fl J k;j 5. EndDo 6. EndDo 7. Drop small elements in row J i;fl 7 8. EndDo The implementation in <ref> [13] </ref> uses two parameters. The first parameter is a drop tolerance which is used mainly in Line 4, to avoid doing an elimination if the pivot is too small. The second parameter is an integer k which controls the number of entries that are kept in line 7.

Reference-contexts: All nonlinearities are solved accurately using the nonlinear version of the GMRES algorithm. For illustration purposes we have used only a simple Block-Jacobi preconditioner though there are existing alternatives which can be superior, see, e.g., <ref> [15] </ref>. Block Jacobi or additive Schwarz, behaves quite well thanks to the stabilized Galerkin formulation and to the fill-in used in the ILUT factorization of the consistent Jacobian matrix. Combining these algorithms it is now possible to tackle large scale 3D problems on available commercial parallel platforms. 12
