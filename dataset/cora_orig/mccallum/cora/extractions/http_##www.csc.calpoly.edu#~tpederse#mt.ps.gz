Reference-contexts: It took 80 researchers more than 7 years to develop a prototype that was demonstrated in 1990. EUROTRA is programmed in Prolog and C and runs on UNIX workstations. EUROTRA is limited to translating texts pertaining to telecommunications. It currently has a terminology database of 12,000 terms. <ref> (Etheridge, 1989) </ref>. In addition, a Japanese to English project is being carried out for the CEC at this time (JEIDA 1989). Siemens of West Germany has developed a large German to English system called METAL that is now available commercially.

Reference-contexts: Booth, a Nuffield Fellow in the Physics Department at Birkbeck College in the University of London, discussed the possibility of using electronic computing devices to translate human languages <ref> (Hutchins 1986) </ref>. In 1949 Weaver wrote a memorandum entitled Translation that was distributed to leaders in the computing field. In this memo he expanded on his idea of using computers to translate human languages. <p> As a result of this conference an MT project was started at Georgetown University by Leon Dostert. The goal of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility of MT. IBM became a collaborator with Georgetown soon after the research group was formed <ref> (Hutchins 1986) </ref>. On January 7, 1954 the Georgetown - IBM team demonstrated its Russian to English translation system. The translation program was very small. It had a vocabulary of 250 Russian words, 6 grammar rules, and very carefully selected Russian text. <p> The demonstration was repeated several times, including once to D.Y. Panov of the USSR Academy of Sciences later that same year. Upon his return MT research began in earnest in the Soviet Union <ref> (Hutchins 1986) </ref>. 4.2 1954 - 1964 Soon after the Georgetown - IBM demonstration MT research expanded greatly both in the USA and abroad. There was a mood of considerable optimism in the field, with a feeling that imminent success was just around the corner. <p> The other camp, made up of groups such as those at MIT, Harvard, RAND, and Berkeley, believed that it was important to understand the underlying linguistic theories before proceeding on to the development of actual systems <ref> (Hutchins 1986) </ref>. In June, 1960 MT research in the USA was given government endorsement with a report compiled by the Committee on Science and Astronautics of the US House of Representatives. <p> the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in 1964, and the Georgetown Automatic Translation (GAT) Russian to English system that had been installed at two locations: the Atomic Energy Commission at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1964 and for the European Atomic Energy Community (EUROTOM) Center at Ispra, Italy in 1963 <ref> (Hutchins 1986) </ref>. These two systems employed fairly simple word for word replacement methodologies. There were no underlying linguistic theories. GAT, for instance, was developed for specific texts, and then modified for another text, and so on (Slocum 1985). <p> The TL text synthesized by GAT and Mark II required extensive post- editing. However, even unedited target text was often judged satisfactory by clients of the GAT system who had the choice between the MT produced text and no translations at all <ref> (Hutchins 1986) </ref>. It was clear that neither the operational nor the theoretical groups had achieved the successes that they had felt were so close at hand. While much progress had been made in linguistic research it was apparent that the problems of translation were far more complex than first expected. <p> However, there are significant improvements in the software design techniques. Rather than being implemented as a huge monolithic program as GAT was, Systran takes advantage of modular design techniques. As a result it is much easier to maintain and modify <ref> (Hutchins 1986) </ref>. During this decade Systran was installed at numerous sites. In July 1970 Systran took over from the IBM Mark II at the USAF's Foreign Technology Division. <p> Systran was used by the National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) during the joint Apollo Soyuz space mission between the USA and USSR 7 in 1974 - 75. In 1976 Systran replaced the GAT system at EURATOM <ref> (Hutchins 1986) </ref>. In 1978 Xerox selected five Systran language pairs for installation. 4.4.2 TAUM METEO MT research in Canada began in the mid-sixties.

Reference-contexts: The ultimate goal of this translator is to make the reader of the TL translation react in the same way to the work as did the reader of the SL original <ref> (Nida 1964) </ref>. Compare this to the task of translating instructions to assemble a flashlight. This translator's mission is to convey the SL instructions well enough so that the flashlight can be put together by a reader of the TL instructions.

Reference-contexts: In addition, it would be difficult to justify the expense of developing an MT system to deal with literary works since there is no shortage of literary translators <ref> (Slocum 1985) </ref>. MT systems must use procedural methods. Text that involves many pragmatic meanings and must use units of translation greater than a sentence is too complex to translate procedurally. MT systems should confine themselves to texts that do not reach this level of meaning. <p> To date, all operational MT systems have concerned themselves with scientific, technical, or bureaucratic texts. This is due to the fact that these are areas that rely less on pragmatic meanings to convey their points and that these are the areas that have the greatest demand for translation <ref> (Slocum 1985 and JEIDA 1989) </ref>. 3 Survey of MT Concepts 3.1 Categories of MT Systems Slocum (1985) describes the three generally accepted categories of MT systems. Fully Automated High Quality Translation (FAHQT), Machine Aided Translation (MAT), and Terminology Data Bases represent successively lower capabilities of MT systems. <p> These two systems employed fairly simple word for word replacement methodologies. There were no underlying linguistic theories. GAT, for instance, was developed for specific texts, and then modified for another text, and so on <ref> (Slocum 1985) </ref>. The TL text synthesized by GAT and Mark II required extensive post- editing. However, even unedited target text was often judged satisfactory by clients of the GAT system who had the choice between the MT produced text and no translations at all (Hutchins 1986). <p> The appeal of translating weather forecasts was that the language and vocabulary used is very limited. This made it well suited for MT and terribly dull for the human translator. It was so monotonous a task that the average tenure of a translator was only 6 months <ref> (Slocum 1985) </ref>. Development of the MT system METEO began in May 1975. By May 1977 the transfer based MT system was operational. METEO is the only fully automatic MT system in operation in the world. It operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. <p> Siemens of West Germany has developed a large German to English system called METAL that is now available commercially. METAL was begun in 1961 at the University of Texas and was taken over by Siemens in 1980 <ref> (Slocum 1985) </ref>. The Translation Bureau of the West German Government is developing a large on-line dictionary for technical terms called LEXIS (JEIDA 1989).

Reference-contexts: Perhaps the way is to descend, from each language, down to the common base of human communication-the real but as yet undiscovered universal language... <ref> (Weaver 1949) </ref>." As a direct result of Weaver's memo, MT research began at the University of Washington, UCLA, and MIT. (Nagoa 1989) The first MT conference was held at MIT from June 17 to June 20 in 1952. The conference was sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation.
