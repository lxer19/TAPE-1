Reference-contexts: Insurances mostly do the financing. National and international organisations constantly watch the population's state of health and try to improve it. All the subjects together are called the health community 1 in the sequel. Obviously, these subjects have their specific interests, which might be conflicting <ref> [1] </ref>. Wellbeing of individuals depends upon trustworthy and economically viable health care services. This implies that, e.g., physicians are personally responsible for the treatment they prescribe 2 and patients may choose the physicians they trust 3 .

Reference-contexts: Other subjects includes in particular those subjects having access to central parts (e.g., communication lines, switching centres, mainframes, etc.) of system S. In health care, some of the characteristic security requirements at end-user interfaces are long-term authentication, confidentiality, and sometimes anonymity <ref> [2] </ref>. As these security requirements refer to individual subjects, they are reasonable requirements only on decentralized information systems. <p> The need for authentication also applies to documents being transmitted. Future applications in telemedicine might highlight this need even more: e.g., medical observation of patients in their homes in order to shorten the periods patients stay in hospitals <ref> [2] </ref>. Various forms of electronic signatures are technical solution to this requirement. 4 The term stronger is quoted because it does not imply a total order on the set of all possible attacker models. Security for decentralized information systems 5 1.2 Confidentiality Most medical data is highly personal and sensitive.

Reference-contexts: Security for decentralized information systems 5 1.2 Confidentiality Most medical data is highly personal and sensitive. Accordingly, it is to be protected from unauthorized disclosure during transmission as well as during storage <ref> [3] </ref>. The technical solution to achieve this in open systems is to use encipherment mechanisms. 1.3 Anonymity Telemedicine might allow patients to access medical information systems and/or expert systems.

Reference-contexts: Smoothly means almost transparent to the intended users. The user interface and the performance should not be affected, unless additional security justifies significant alterations. Naturally, cryptographic mechanisms would be placed within the operating system and/or the network <ref> [4] </ref>. The commercial need for secure open systems increases and the market of commercial operating systems and computer networks is beginning to reflect this by utilizing cryptography. <p> A dependable identification mechanism will be the key to accountability, a necessary property of a system dealing with sensitive data. Secure end-to-end means that the content of the communication is protected at the application layer <ref> [4] </ref> against repudiation of authorship (data authentication), undetected, unauthorized modification (integrity) and unauthorized disclosure (confidentiality). Other network layers are not affected by SECURE Talk.

Reference-contexts: Characteristic parameters (security parameters, mode of operation, etc.) of each mechanism may be modified by a user as they are subject to the user configuration. This allows high flexibility and adaptability to future needs. Among the available mechanisms are: Encipherment mechanisms like DES, G-DES <ref> [5] </ref>, RSA encipherment [6] 8 , electronic signature mechanisms like RSA, ElGamal [7] and Damgfird [8] signatures, DSS [9], the crypto-world's first provably secure 9 electronic signature mechanism GMR [10], etc., hash 8 To avoid active attacks, RSA encipherment is improved by a redundancy predicate. 9 Provably secure here means: provable
