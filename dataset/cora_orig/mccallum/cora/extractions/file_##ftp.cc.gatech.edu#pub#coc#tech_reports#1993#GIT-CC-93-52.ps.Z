Abstract: The importance of computer applications and telecommunication services relying on efficient multi-destination communication is growing rapidly. It is now likely that a significant portion of the overall traffic in future communication environments will be of the multi-destination type. At the same time, lightwave technology is emerging as a promising candidate for implementing the next generation of multiuser high-speed networks. In this paper we address the open issue of providing efficient mechanisms for multi-destination communication over one class of lightwave WDM architectures, namely, single-hop networks. We suggest, analyze, and optimize several alternative approaches for broadcast/multicast. One of our major contributions is the development of a suite of adaptive multicast protocols which have superior performance, are very simple to implement, and are insensitive to propagation delays.

Reference-contexts: Our concern in this paper is with one class of the proposed architectures, namely, single-hop networks. Single-hop networks <ref> [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] </ref> are all-optical in nature, i.e., a packet is sent from the source to the destination in one hop, without passing through intermediate stations. <p> This is an extension of TDMA over a multichannel environment. For single-destination traffic, we have defined all possible types of schedules, and we have developed a general framework for analyzing and optimizing their throughput for any number of available wavelengths, any transceiver tunability characteristics, and non-uniform traffic <ref> [13] </ref>. The issue of multi-destination traffic has not, however, been adequately addressed in this environment. One important reason may have been the lack of understanding of complicating issues such as the variety of transceiver tunability characteristics and the domination of propagation delays. <p> Each station has N buffers, one for storing packets destined to each of the N 1 possible destinations, and one for storing multi-destination packets. Each buffer can hold one packet; packets arriving to a full buffer are lost. This is an extension of our model in <ref> [13] </ref>, which in turn is an extension of the single-channel model in [15]. We assume single hop communication. Coordination between the transmitting and receiving stations is achieved by using a predefined, wavelength-time oriented schedule that works as follows. Time slots are grouped in frames of M slots. <p> A collision occurs when two or more transmitters access the same channel during a slot. On the other hand, networks with tunable receivers may experience destination conflicts if multiple stations are permitted to transmit to the same destination on different channels within a given slot. In <ref> [13] </ref> several transmission modes were introduced based on the transmissions allowed within a slot. <p> The schedule in all other stations. Figure 1 (d) shows a cyclic broadcast schedule where each station is the owner of exactly one broadcast slot per frame. The multicast schedule of Figure 1 (e) is such that in each slot 4 Of the transmission modes introduced in <ref> [13] </ref> only the one-to-one mode will be considered here, mainly because it involves no packet loss due to collisions or destination conflicts. However, all our results can be easily generalized to include other modes. <p> However, all our results can be easily generalized to include other modes. This may be desirable under certain single-destination traffic parameters for which other transmission modes have been shown to have better performance <ref> [13] </ref>. 4 network with N = 4 stations and C = 2 wavelengths, X 1 = f1; 3g; X 2 = f2; 4g one station (the owner) gets to transmit to a multicast group, while one of the transmitters not sharing the same wavelength with the owner may transmit to a <p> If i = 8 i, the optimal broadcast schedule is a cyclic one, as in Figure 1 (d). 5 Analysis and optimization of schedules for single-destination traffic only ( i = 0 8 i) is presented in <ref> [13] </ref>. 6 3.2 Optimal One-to-One Schedules Consider a multi-destination packet arriving at station i and finding the multi-destination packet buffer empty (and, thus, it is accepted). <p> In general, stations should share channels so that some load balancing be achieved, and, unless i = 8 i, each channel may be shared by a different number of transmitters. Given i , the techniques developed in <ref> [13] </ref> can help us determine how transmitters should share the available channels, i.e., how X c should be constructed. <p> As a first step, one has to determine the type of schedule and, if applicable, the type of contention-resolution policy to use. From previous experience <ref> [13] </ref> we expect this to be a very hard allocation problem. In this section we develop an optimization heuristic to construct schedules that not only perform very well, but also guarantee a (user-specified) level of throughput for each class of traffic. <p> We now propose the following Schedule-Merging Heuristic (SMH). Schedule-Merging Heuristic (SMH) (For constructing One-to-One schedules) 1. Given single-destination traffic parameters i and p ij , and the number of available wavelengths, C, obtain an optimized one-to-one schedule, S 0 , as described in <ref> [13] </ref>. Let M be the number of slots per frame of S 0 . Evaluate its throughput, T total (S 0 ), under mixed traffic. 2. Given i and C obtain a one-to-one schedule, S 0 0 , optimized for multi-destination traffic only (as in Section 3.2).

Reference-contexts: The network operates in a slotted mode, with a slot time equal to the packet transmission time plus the tuning time. All stations are synchronized to the slot boundaries <ref> [14] </ref>. We define i and i as the probability that a new single-destination and multi-destination packet, respectively, arrives at station i during a slot time. p ij is the probability that an arriving single-destination packet is destined to station j, and P j p ij = 1 3 . <p> In this Figure we show a synchronization slot of i followed by F free slots and an synchronization slot; the horizontal axis represents time increasing from left to right. The transmitters of both i and k are synchronized at the beginning of each slot <ref> [14] </ref>. But a packet transmitted by i will not be heard by the receiver of k until t ik slots later, where t ik is the propagation delay from i to k in slots. <p> The range of propagation delays plotted represent delays over distances up to 20Km, reasonable for LANs/MANs. Note that because of the extra padding needed for synchronization within each slot <ref> [14] </ref>, the slot duration is actually larger than just the time needed to transmit a packet. single-destination throughput only slightly decreases as propagation delays increase.
