Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with the application of learning algorithms to the classification of reactor states in nuclear plants. Two aspects must be considered: (1) some types of events (e.g., abnormal or rare) will not appear in the data set, but the system should be able to detect them, (2) not only classification of signals but also their interpretation are important for nuclear plant monitoring. We address both issues with a mixture of mixtures of Gaussians in which some parameters are shared to reflect the similar signals observed in different states of the reactor. An EM algorithm for these shared Gaussian mixtures is presented. Experimental results on nuclear plant data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach with respect to the above two points.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One of the basic problems in the validation of data from a nuclear power plant is to estimate the state of the reactor from noise-contaminated data. In a previous work <ref> [DLG + 95] </ref>, a wavelet-based pre-processing of the channel outlet temperature signal has been used for detection of flow blockage during the start-up operation of the PLGS nuclear plant. So far, this work was concerned with the detection of characteristic transients.
