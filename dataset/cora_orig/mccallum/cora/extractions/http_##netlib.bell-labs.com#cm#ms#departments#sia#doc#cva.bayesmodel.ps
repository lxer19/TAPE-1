Abstract: In customer value analysis (CVA), a company conducts sample surveys of its customers and of its competitors' customers to determine the relative performance of the company on many attributes ranging from product quality and technology to pricing and sales support. The data discussed in this paper are from a quarterly survey run at Lucent Technologies. We have built a Bayesian model for the data that is partly hierarchical and has a time series component. By "model" we mean the full specification of information that allows the computation of posterior distributions of the data | sharp specifications such as independent errors with normal distributions and diffuse specifications such as probability distributions on parameters arising from sharp specifications. The model includes the following: (1) survey respondent effects are modeled by random location and scale effects, a t-distribution for the location and a Weibull distribution for the scale; (2) company effects for each attribute through time are modeled by integrated sum-difference processes; (3) error effects are modeled by a normal distribution whose variance depends on the attribute; in the model, the errors are multiplied by the respondent scale effects. The model is the first full description of CVA data; it provides both a characterization of the performance of the specific companies in the survey as well as a mechanism for studying some of the basic notions of CVA theory. Building the model and using it to form conclusions about CVA, stimulated work on statistical theory, models, and methods: (1) a Bayesian theory of data exploration that provides an overall guide for methods used to explore data for the purpose of making decisions about model specifications; (2) an approach to modeling random location and scale effects in the presence of explanatory variables; (3) a reformulation of integrated moving-average processes into integrated sum-difference models, which enhances interpretation, model building, and computation of posterior distributions; (4) post-posterior modeling to combine certain specific exogenous information | information from sources outside of the data | with the information in a posterior distribution that does not incorporate the exogenous information; (5) trellis display, a framework for the display of multivariable data.

Reference-contexts: So their methods, which have an empirical Bayes flavor, amount to deconvolution procedures. Integrated Sum-Difference Models We employ an integrated moving-average time series model <ref> (Box and Jenk-ins, 1970) </ref> to describe changes through time in company-attribute effects.

Reference-contexts: But recent evolutions of this philosophy have had significant changes <ref> (Cleveland, 1993) </ref>. In recent decades computing technology has changed so profoundly that it calls for revised fundamentals for approaching data. There has been an enormous increase in the power of visualization tools for exploration.

Reference-contexts: Instead of building strong assumptions about attribute relationships into our model at the outset, we decided to employ post-posterior analysis <ref> (Cleveland and Liu, 1998a) </ref>. To make our analysis fathomable | specifically, to bring in our exogenous knowledge about relationships in a reliable way | we focused just on the as . We studied their posterior distribution.

Reference-contexts: To do this we developed a class of models | integrated sum-difference models, or ISD (d,q) | which are IMA (d,q) models but are structured differently; the new structure enhances interpretation, model building, and computation of posterior distributions <ref> (Cleveland and Liu, 1998b) </ref>. The new structure models a differenced series by a sum of orthogonal series, each the output of applying, to white noise, filters that are made up of products of powers of first-difference filters and first-sum filters. <p> This ISD (1,1) process is also an IMA (1,1). Formulating the structure as an ISD leads to a more fathomable parameterization that allows better incorporation of exogenous information and more efficient computational methods <ref> (Cleveland and Liu, 1998b) </ref>. In Section 7 we give reasons for not wanting to impose strong restrictions on the asq across a for fixed s and q even though there is a body of exogenous information that we might invoke to do so.

Reference-contexts: Customer Survey Data 6 because model building, model fitting, and diagnostic checking are complex. Often, the issue is ignored, or effects are estimated as fixed which uses up too many degrees of freedom unless each rater does ratings of many cases <ref> (Longford, 1995) </ref>. Cleveland, Denby, and Liu (1998) have developed an approach to modeling random location and scale effects in the presence of explanatory variables. An overall framework is posited that can be verified by diagnostic checking.
