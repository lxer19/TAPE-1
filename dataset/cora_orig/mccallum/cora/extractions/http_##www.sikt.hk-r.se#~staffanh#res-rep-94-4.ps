Abstract: Distributed computing, where the underlying network is complex, heterogeneous and unreliable, is hard to realize with traditional approaches. Ener gy Distribution Automation (DA), where the power line is used for communication, and the processing is highly distributed, is our application domain for assessments of new technologies for this kind of system. In this paper we propose a Multi-Agent approach with a large expected number of heavily distributed, medium grain agents. The concept of Agent-Oriented Programming (AOP) is adopted, and an architecture, the DA-SoC, is developed. The language DAAL is used for programming the agents, and the most important feature is a novel programmable Model of Interaction (MoI), which allows the user to tailor agent interaction and the social behaviour of agents in the society. The semantic addressing is a powerful abstraction mechanism, that facilitates run-time network management. The research reported here is a cooperation between the authors af filiations mentioned above, and it is a part of the larger projects, Intelligent Distribution Automation (IDA) at Syd-kraft, Malmoe, Sweden, and Societies of Computation (SoC) at the University of Karlskro-na/Ronneby, Sweden.
