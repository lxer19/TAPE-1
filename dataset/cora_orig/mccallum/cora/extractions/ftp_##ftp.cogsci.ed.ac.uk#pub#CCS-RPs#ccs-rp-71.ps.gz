Reference-contexts: We used for the experiments a set of randomly selected articles from the Wall Street Journal contained in the acl/dci cd-rom, rather than a corpus of transcripts of spoken language corpora such as the hcrc MapTask corpus <ref> (Anderson et al., 1991) </ref> or the trains corpus (Heeman and Allen, 1995). The main reason for this choice was to avoid dealing with deictical uses of definite descriptions and with phenomena such as reference failure and repair.

Reference-contexts: For both of these reasons, the classification schemes that we tried differ in several respects from those adopted in prior corpus-based studies such as (Prince, 1981; Fraurud, 1990). Our study is also different from these previous ones in that measuring the agreement among annotators became an issue <ref> (Carletta, 1996) </ref>. <p> Table 4: Confusion matrix of A and B's classifications. 18 A Corpus-Based Investigation of Definite Description Use In order to measure the agreement in a more precise way, we used the so-called Kappa Statistic (Siegel and Castellan, 1988), recently proposed by Carletta as a measure of agreement for discourse analysis <ref> (Carletta, 1996) </ref>. We also used a measure of per-class agreement that we introduced ourselves. We discuss these results below, after reviewing briefly how K is computed. <p> Second Experiment 27 as members of the same class. And indeed, the agreement figures went up from K=0.63 to K=0.68 (ignoring doubts) when we did so, i.e., back within the `tentative' margins of agreement according to <ref> (Carletta, 1996) </ref> (0:68 x &lt; 0:8).

Reference-contexts: experimental evaluation is also seen as a necessary precondition for the kind of system evaluation done, e.g., in the Message Understanding initiative (muc), where the performance of a system is evaluated by comparing its output on a collection of texts with a standardized annotation of those texts produced by humans <ref> (Chinchor and Sundheim, 1995) </ref>. Clearly, a muc-style evaluation presupposes an annotation scheme on which all participants agree.

Reference-contexts: Attempts at making this intuition more precise include Christopherson's familiarity theory (1939), Strawson's presuppositional theory of definite descriptions (Strawson, 1950), Hawkins' own location theory (Hawkins, 1978) and its revision, Clark and Marshall's theory of definite reference and mutual knowledge <ref> (Clark and Marshall, 1981) </ref>, as well as more formal proposals such as (Heim, 1982). Neither the uniqueness nor the familiarity approach have yet succeeded in providing a satisfactory account of all uses of definite descriptions (Frau-rud, 1990; Birner and Ward, 1994). <p> At least three of the `unfamiliar uses' of Hawkins|NP complements, referent-establishing relative clauses, and associative clauses|fall in this category. (See also <ref> (Clark and Marshall, 1981) </ref>.) 2.4 Some Remarks about Coverage Perhaps the most important question concerning a classification scheme is its coverage. The two taxonomies we have just seen are largely satisfactory in this respect, but a couple of issues are worth mentioning. <p> Similar cases of `underspecified' definite descriptions have been observed before (e.g., Nunberg's John shot himself in the foot or I'm going to the store mentioned in <ref> (Clark and Mar-shall, 1981) </ref>) but no real account has been given of the conditions under which they are possible. 5 Discussion and Conclusions 5.1 Some Consequences Consequences for Corpus Annotation This study raises the issue of how feasible it is to annotate corpora for anaphoric information. <p> not discuss the conditions under which a writer can assume that the reader can recognize that context creates a functional concept out of a sortal one, but his account could be supplemented by Clark and Marshall's theory of what may count as a basis for a mutual knowledge induction schema <ref> (Clark and Marshall, 1981) </ref>. 18 18 Lobner's theory still does not account for generic uses of definite descriptions.

Reference-contexts: The problem with these uses is that the very question of whether the `referent' is familiar or not seems misplaced|these uses are not `referential'. A problem related to the one just mentioned is that certain uses of definite descriptions are ambiguous between a referential and an attributive interpretation <ref> (Donnellan, 1972) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: and we developed from there two slightly different annotation schemes, which allowed us to see whether it was better to describe the classes to our annotators in a surface-oriented or a semantic fashion, and to evaluate the seriousness of the problems with these schemes identified in the literature (see, e.g., <ref> (Fraurud, 1990) </ref>). We discuss Hawkins' and Prince's taxonomies next. 2.1 The Christopherson / Hawkins' List of Definite Descrip tion Uses The wide range of uses of definite descriptions was already highlighted in (Christopherson, 1939). In the third chapter of his book, Hawkins (1978) further develops and extends Christopherson's list. <p> definite descriptions or uses that are ambiguous between a referential and an attributive use will not be addressed in this paper. 2.5 Fraurud's Study A second problem with the classification schemes we have discussed was raised by Fraurud in her study of definite nps in a corpus of Swedish text <ref> (Fraurud, 1990) </ref>. Fraurud introduced a drastically simplified classification scheme based on two classes only: subsequent mention, corresponding to Hawkins' anaphoric definite descriptions and Prince's discourse-old, and first-mention, including all other definite descriptions. <p> Surprising as it may seem, this finding is in fact just a confirmation of the results of other researchers. <ref> (Fraurud, 1990) </ref> reports that 60.9% of definite descriptions in her corpus of 11 Swedish texts are `first-mention', i.e., do not co-refer with an entity already evoked in the text; 13 (Gallaway, 1996) found a distribution similar to ours in (English) spoken child language. <p> In addition, we observed a previously unreported (to our knowledge) 13 As mentioned above, Fraurud's first-mention class consists of Prince's discourse-new, inferrables, and containing inferrables. 14 As discussed above, this problem with Hawkins' and Prince's classification schemes had already been noted by Fraurud|e.g., <ref> (Fraurud, 1990) </ref>, page 416. 15 We will discuss an explanation for this correlation suggested in (Lobner, 1985). 22 A Corpus-Based Investigation of Definite Description Use correlation between discourse-novelty and syntactic constructions such as appositions, copular constructions, and comparatives. <p> We briefly discuss below our progress in this direction so far. Consequences for Linguistic Theory Our study confirms the findings of previous work (e.g., <ref> (Fraurud, 1990) </ref>) that a great number of the definite descriptions in texts are discourse-new: in our second experiment we found an equal number of discourse-new and `discourse-related' definite descriptions, although many of the definite descriptions classified as discourse new could be seen as associative in a loose sense.

Reference-contexts: Surprising as it may seem, this finding is in fact just a confirmation of the results of other researchers. (Fraurud, 1990) reports that 60.9% of definite descriptions in her corpus of 11 Swedish texts are `first-mention', i.e., do not co-refer with an entity already evoked in the text; 13 <ref> (Gallaway, 1996) </ref> found a distribution similar to ours in (English) spoken child language. Disagreements Among Annotators The second notable result was the relatively low agreement among annotators. The reason for this disagreement was not so much annotators' errors as the fact, already mentioned, that the classes are not mutually exclusive.

Reference-contexts: For these reasons we chose Hawkins' list of definite description uses <ref> (Hawkins, 1978) </ref> and Prince's taxonomy (Prince, 1981; Prince, 1992) as our starting point, and we developed from there two slightly different annotation schemes, which allowed us to see whether it was better to describe the classes to our annotators in a surface-oriented or a semantic fashion, and to evaluate the seriousness <p> This is also true of some of the uses Hawkins classified as `unfamiliar': for example, of his `nominal modifiers' and `associative clause' classes. Attempts at making this intuition more precise include Christopherson's familiarity theory (1939), Strawson's presuppositional theory of definite descriptions (Strawson, 1950), Hawkins' own location theory <ref> (Hawkins, 1978) </ref> and its revision, Clark and Marshall's theory of definite reference and mutual knowledge (Clark and Marshall, 1981), as well as more formal proposals such as (Heim, 1982).

Reference-contexts: Clearly, a muc-style evaluation presupposes an annotation scheme on which all participants agree. Our own concern are semantic judgments concerning the interpretation of noun phrases with the definite article the, that we will call definite descriptions, following <ref> (Russell, 1919) </ref>. 2 These noun phrases are one the most common constructs in English, 3 and have been extensively studied by linguists, philosophers, psychologists, and computational linguists (Russell, 1905; Christopherson, 1939; Strawson, 1950; Clark, 1977; Grosz, 1977; Co-hen, 1978; Hawkins, 1978; Sidner, 1979; Webber, 1979; Clark and Marshall, 1981; Prince, 1981; <p> One group of authors have identified uniqueness as the defining property of definite descriptions.

Reference-contexts: We will then say, following Sidner's terminology <ref> (Sidner, 1979) </ref>, that a definite description co-specifies with its antecedent in a text, when such antecedent exists, if the definite description and its antecedent denote the same object.

The first version of the system finds a classification for 318 definite descriptions out of the 464 in our test data (the articles used in the second experiment).
