Title: Switch-Aided Flooding Operations in ATM Networks

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a flooding method, called Switch-Aided Flooding (SAF), for use in ATM networks. SAF-based protocols take advantage of hardware-supported cell relay and cell duplication, characteristic of such networks, in order to reduce the time needed to disseminate changes in network topology and resource availability. SAF protocols use a spanning multipoint connection (SMC), which is a hardware-switched network spanning tree, but revert to conventional link-by-link flooding when the spanning MC is unavailable or under construction. The results of a simulation study reveal that the proposed flooding protocols deliver network updates several times faster than conventional approaches, while using significantly less bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: Although hardware switching and cell duplication may greatly improve the communication performance observed by end hosts and their applications, the signaling activities within ATM networks proceed in a connectionless manner: VC-setup request messages are forwarded and processed hop by hop <ref> [1] </ref>. Switches along the route of the VC under construction invoke signaling modules to perform tasks such as routing, call admission control, and resource allocation. In gen 1 At this point, we use the term VCI to represent the VPI/VCI pair. <p> LSR was first developed for the use in the ARPANET [2], and it was later accepted by the Internet community in the form of the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol [3]. LSR is also included in the ATM PNNI (Private Network-to-Network Interface) standard <ref> [1] </ref>. The flooding protocol in LSR networks is a highly robust network-wide broadcast protocol that makes use of all network links to disseminate LSAs. In order to flood an LSA, the source switch sends the LSA to all its neighboring switches.

Reference-contexts: Such information is made available to the signaling modules by the routing protocol, a critical component of ATM networks. ATM networks use link-state routing (LSR) <ref> [2] </ref>, which periodically disseminates status information throughout the network. The local status of each switch, including the status of its incident links, is learned by the rest of the network switches via these link-state advertisements (LSAs). Based on received LSAs, each switch maintains a complete local image of the network. <p> Link-state routing <ref> [2] </ref> is a type of routing protocol that makes complete knowledge of the network available to all switches by means of the flooding of LSAs. LSR was first developed for the use in the ARPANET [2], and it was later accepted by the Internet community in the form of the Open <p> Link-state routing <ref> [2] </ref> is a type of routing protocol that makes complete knowledge of the network available to all switches by means of the flooding of LSAs.

If network status values comprise simple ON/OFF states, it is possible to design LSR protocols that do not rely on periodic flooding [8, 9]. However, ATM networks must disseminate the availability of network resources at a high rate for the purpose of accurate call admission control.

Reference-contexts: The SMC protocol is a variation of the CBT protocol <ref> [4] </ref>, a general MC protocol in which the topology of the MC is the union of shortest paths from (a) step 1 (b) step 2 (c) step 3 (d) step 4 the members to a specific node, called the core.

Reference-contexts: Although core selections by switches may differ for short periods of time, it can be shown that, if the network is not permanently partitioned, the switches will reach consensus <ref> [5] </ref>. Next, each switch tries to establish a connection to its choice of core node. For a switch x to reach its core selection c x , the switch sends a reach core request one hop towards the core, according to an x-to-c x shortest path computed locally. <p> Due to space limitations, details about SMC construction, the handling of inconsistent core selections, and the detection and repair of broken SMCs, are omitted here. Interested readers please refer to <ref> [5] </ref>. (a) reach core requests (b) step 1 (c) step 2 (d) step 3 (e) step 4 (f) step 5 Because a spanning MC is effectively a broadcast medium that allows interleaving of messages, every switch in the network can broadcast messages to and receive messages from all other switches. <p> Consider a network G = (V; E), where V is the set of switches and E the set of point-to-point links. It is shown in <ref> [5] </ref> that B basic B c AvgD + 1 AvgD 1 ; where B basic is the bandwidth consumption of the basic SAF protocol, B c is that of the conventional flooding method, and AvgD stands for the average node degree in the network. <p> Switches receiving the LSA via point-to-point links forward the real LSA on all incident links except that of arrival, and expect nothing from neighbors. Again we use examples to illustrate; protocol details are omitted due to space limitations, but can be found in our technical report <ref> [5] </ref>. The operation of the BE SAF protocol with a fully operational SMC is depicted in Figure 6. Similar to the basic SAF protocol, the BE SAF protocol in this setting requires only two communication steps. <p> Due to space limitations, we summarize the results as follows: a partitioned SMC requires less than 2.5 milliseconds to reorganize, while constructing an SMC from scratch (a relatively rare event) requires less than 12 ms. More details can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. 6 Related Work The conventional flooding protocol described in this work was first used in ARPANET [2]. If network status values comprise simple ON/OFF states, it is possible to design LSR protocols that do not rely on periodic flooding [8, 9]. <p> The investigation of this hybrid approach is one of our on-going studies.

Reference-contexts: In addition to applications in SAF, spanning MCs and attendant protocols may be important to ATM applications that require a virtual network-wide broadcast medium. One such application is LAN emulation <ref> [14] </ref>. 7 Conclusions In this paper, we have proposed two switch-aided flooding protocols and an accompanying protocol to construct spanning MCs. The protocols are designed to exploit ATM hardware cell switching and cell duplication. SAF protocols use the SMC as a broadcast medium to reduce flooding time.
