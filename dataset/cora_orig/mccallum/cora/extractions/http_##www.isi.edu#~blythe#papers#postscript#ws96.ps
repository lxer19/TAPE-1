Title: A Representation for Efficient Planning in Dynamic Domains with External Events  
Author: Jim Blythe 
Address: Pittsburgh, PA 15213  
Affiliation: School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University  
Abstract: I present a language for specifying planning problems in which there are external events, that is, events beyond the direct control of the planner which may take place while a plan is being executed. The language is based on Miller and Shanahan's representation of narratives in the situation calculus. I describe an implemented planner and prove that it produces correct plans for a subset of this language. I discuss how some aspects of the language affect the efficiency of the planner.

Reference-contexts: Although it does not make full use of Miller and Shanahan's descriptions of simultaneous events and is less expressive than others that address similar issues, for example (Shanahan 1995), <ref> (Baral 1995) </ref>, it is one of only a few currently used in an implemented planner. The model of non-deterministic action used here is similar to that of the Buridan planner (Kushmerick, Hanks, & Weld 1993).

Reference-contexts: Proving that this more strict filter for events is correct requires an extension to the proof presented here. I have also investigated a means to filter out irrelevant events based on a static analysis that can be made from the domain before planning begins <ref> (Blythe 1996) </ref>. The power of this approach depends on the use of small, relatively independent events, which may take place concurrently. This representation choice is therefore important to the model satisfying the third criterion mentioned in the introduction, allowing relevant events to be found efficiently.

Reference-contexts: an event is relevant to the plan, it may not be relevant to every step, and in fact the goal structure of the plan leads directly to an independence structure for the events and actions that can be used to compute the probability of goal success in a Bayesian net <ref> (Kushmerick, Hanks, & Weld 1993) </ref>. Indeed, the execution graph described in section is implemented as a Bayesian net in Weaver. Within the model of events described here, the use of probabilities is viewed as a technique for efficient planning rather than as a fundamental property of the action model. <p> The model of non-deterministic action used here is similar to that of the Buridan planner <ref> (Kushmerick, Hanks, & Weld 1993) </ref>. There is a need both for more analysis of models like these and of appropriate planning algorithms and techniques, and for more empirical studies of such domains and planners. Weaver is currently a greedy planner that iteratively improves its plan.

Reference-contexts: It also allows efficient reasoning about the events relevant to a particular plan by exploiting their independence structure. The model can be described by a modified version of narratives in the situation calculus, described in <ref> (Miller & Shanahan 1994) </ref>. Although it does not make full use of Miller and Shanahan's descriptions of simultaneous events and is less expressive than others that address similar issues, for example (Shanahan 1995), (Baral 1995), it is one of only a few currently used in an implemented planner.

Reference-contexts: Within the model of events described here, the use of probabilities is viewed as a technique for efficient planning rather than as a fundamental property of the action model. Thus non-deterministic planners that make no use of probabilities, such as Cassandra <ref> (Pryor & Collins 1993) </ref>, could be extended to use the same action model.
