Abstract: We present a method for computing holographic patterns for the generation of three-dimensional (3-D) holographic images at interactive speeds. We used this method to render holograms on a conventional computer graphics workstation. The framebuffer system supplied signals directly to a real-time holographic (holovideo) display. We developed an efficient algorithm for computing an image-plane stereogram, a type of hologram that allowed for several computational simplifications. The rendering algorithm generated the holographic pattern by compositing a sequence of view images that were rendered using a recentering shear-camera geometry. Computational efficiencies of our rendering method allowed the workstation to calculate a 6-megabyte holographic pattern in under 2 seconds, over 100 times faster than traditional computing methods. Data-transfer time was negligible. Holovideo displays are ideal for numerous 3-D visualization applications, and promise to provide 3-D images with extreme realism. Although the focus of this work was on fast computation for holovideo, the computed holograms can be displayed using other holographic media. We present our method for generating holographic patterns, preceded by a background section containing an introduction to optical and computational holography and holographic displays.

Reference-contexts: Three-dimensional displays are generally electronic devices that provide binocular depth cues, particularly binocular disparity and convergence. (See the Glossary on the next page.) Some 3-D displays provide additional depth cues such as motion parallax and ocular accommodation. The reference by McKenna <ref> [1] </ref> contains a good discussion of the visual depth cues and a detailed evaluation of 3-D display techniques. Recently, some 3-D displays have been used interactively. <p> The inclusion of depth cues - particularly binocular disparity, motion parallax, and occlusion - increases the realism of an image. Holography [2] is the only imaging technique that can provide all the depth cues <ref> [1] </ref>. All other 3-D display devices lack one or more of the visual depth cues. For example, stereoscopic displays do not provide ocular accommodation, and volume displays cannot provide occlusion. Image resolution and parallax resolution are also important considerations when displaying 3-D images.

Reference-contexts: The merit of a 3-D display depends primarily on its ability to provide depth cues and high resolutions. The inclusion of depth cues - particularly binocular disparity, motion parallax, and occlusion - increases the realism of an image. Holography <ref> [2] </ref> is the only imaging technique that can provide all the depth cues [1]. All other 3-D display devices lack one or more of the visual depth cues. For example, stereoscopic displays do not provide ocular accommodation, and volume displays cannot provide occlusion. <p> BACKGROUND This section contains an introduction to holography, computational holography, holographic displays, and stereograms. The concepts discussed here were essential to the development of a faster method for hologram rendering. 2.1 Optical Holography Optical holography <ref> [2] </ref> uses the physical phenomena of interference and diffraction to record and reconstruct a 3-D image. Holographic imaging became practical in the 1960s with the advent of coherent monochromatic laser light. To produce a hologram, light is scattered from the object to be recorded. <p> Consequently, the Fourier-transform approach was slow and inefficient for computing 3-D images. A more straightforward approach to the computation of holographic fringes resembled 3-D computer graphics ray-tracing. Light from a given point or element of an object contributed a complex wavefront at the hologram plane <ref> [2] </ref>. Each of these complex wavefronts was summed to calculate the total object wavefront which was subsequently added to a reference wavefront. Black (non-scattering) regions of the image volume were ignored, enabling very rapid computations of simple object scenes. Again, for more complex images, computation was prohibitively slow.

Reference-contexts: In optical holography, a recorded interference pattern reconstructs an image with an extremely high degree of accuracy. A holographic pattern - called fringes - can be computed and used to generate a 3-D image, most recently in real time <ref> [3] </ref>. Both the computing process and the displaying process are significantly more difficult than in other 3-D display systems. Nevertheless, a real-- time electro-holographic (holovideo) display can produce dynamic 3-D images with all of the depth cues and image realism found in optical holography. <p> A larger image requires a proportionally larger number of samples. Several techniques have been used to reduce information content to a manageable size. The elimination of vertical parallax provides great savings in display complexity <ref> [3] </ref> and computational requirements [5] without greatly compromising the overall display performance. Other less desirable sacrifices include reducing the size of the object scene or the size of the viewing zone. There are several methods of computing holographic fringes. <p> Most researchers reported images that were still quite small and essentially two-dimensional [7]. An ideal holographic SLM does not yet exist, but time-multiplexing of a very fast SLM provides a suitable substitute. The display system that we used in this research was similar to previously reported holovideo displays <ref> [3] </ref>. Our display used the combination of an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) and a series of lenses and scanning mirrors to assemble a small full-color 3-D holographic image at video frame rates. A partial schematic is shown in Figure 2.

Galyean Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Laboratory * The size and complexity of holographic fringe patterns often precludes their computation at interactive rates. In the field of computational holography <ref> [4] </ref>, a discretized holographic fringe pattern is generated by numerically simulating the propagation and interference of light. Typical sampling sizes are smaller than the wavelength of visible light. Therefore, a computer-generated hologram (CGH) must contain a huge number of samples. <p> Both the image resolution and parallax resolution of an optical holographic image are virtually unlimited. 2.2 Computational Holography To produce dynamic holographic images, researchers can compute and display holographic fringe patterns. Computational holography <ref> [4] </ref> generally begins with a 3-D numerical description of the object or scene to be reproduced. Light is numerically scattered from the object scene and propagated to the plane of the hologram. The object wavefront is calculated, and a reference beam wavefront added, imitating optical interference. <p> There are several methods of computing holographic fringes. Most imitate the interference that occurs when a hologram is produced optically using coherent light. Early methods made use of the Fourier transform to calculate the phase and amplitude of the object wavefront at the plane of the hologram <ref> [4] </ref>. At each sample point in the hologram plane, this object light wavefront was added to a reference beam wavefront, and the magnitude squared became the desired fringe pattern. This approach was used to create planar images. Multiple image planes were separately processed and combined to produce 3-D images. <p> In the earliest work in computational holography, the computed fringe pattern was recorded (permanently) in a piece of film <ref> [4] </ref>. The film provided the SBWP sufficient to represent the fringes. In some cases, the film also provided grayscale. Light passing through this film created a static holographic image. To create dynamic holographic images, a dynamic spatial light modulator (SLM) must be used.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the cost of calculating each sample is high if a conventional approach is taken. Even with the power currently available in scientific workstations, researchers in the field of computational holography commonly report computation times in minutes or hours. In recent work <ref> [5] </ref>, Lucente used a massively parallel supercomputer to calculate holographic fringes at interactive rates. In this paper we describe the first use of a standard graphics workstation to render and display holograms at interactive rates. <p> Computational holography produces 3-D imaging with a high degree of realism. Only recently have researchers achieved computational holography at interactive rates, impeded mainly by the enormous data content and by the computational complexity associated with holographic fringes <ref> [5] </ref>. A typical full-parallax hologram 100 mm 100 mm in size has a space-bandwidth product (SBWP) of over 100 gigasamples of information. A larger image requires a proportionally larger number of samples. Several techniques have been used to reduce information content to a manageable size. <p> A larger image requires a proportionally larger number of samples.

For comparison, in past work by Lucente <ref> [5] </ref> using a data-parallel supercomputer, 0.4 s was spent transferring the 6-MB fringe pattern from the 16 K processors to the framebuffer. The benchmark computation time of 2 s for our rendering method was fast enough to provide interactivity to a patient viewer.
