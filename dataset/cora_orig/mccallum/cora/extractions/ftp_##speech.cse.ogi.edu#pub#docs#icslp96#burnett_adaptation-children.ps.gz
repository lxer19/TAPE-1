Title: Rapid Unsupervised Adaptation to Children's Speech on a Connected-Digit Task  for Spoken Language Understanding  
Author: Daniel C. Burnett and Mark Fanty 
Affiliation: Center  Oregon Graduate Institute of Science Technology  
Abstract: We are exploring ways in which to rapidly adapt our neural network classifiers to new speakers and conditions using very small amounts of speech, say, one or a few words. Our approach is to perform a speaker-dependent warping of the frequency scale by selecting a Bark offset for each speaker. We choose the offset for a speaker to be the one that maximizes our recognizer output score on the adaptation utterance. We then use the speaker's offset during evaluation of all other utterances by the speaker. To test our approach, we evaluate an adult-speech trained recognizer on children's speech from the same task both before and after adaptation to each child's voice. Using only a single digit for adaptation, we have reduced the word error rate for children's speech from 9.6% to 4.2%. Using a seven-digit utterance further reduced the error rate to 3.5%.

This work has also been extended by the authors [5], who experimented with linearly scaling the frequency axis for speakers from the Switchboard corpus. The optimal scale factor was selected by trying different values and choosing the one that maximized the a-posteriori probability of the data.

Reference-contexts: Bark-scale offset parameter One factor that varies among speakers, especially between adults and children, is the length of the individual's vocal tract. One effect of the difference in vocal tract lengths can be seen in the speech spectra of vowels. Bladon, et al. <ref> [2] </ref>, compared average spectra, for the vowel /"/, for male and female speakers of Northern British English and noticed that when presented on the Bark scale (a `tonality' scale, based on the frequency analysis properties of the ear's basilar membrane, which expands the resolution of lower frequencies and compresses that of

Reference-contexts: A similar comparison between male speakers and children is shown in figures 1 through 3. The idea of warping the frequency scale to normalize for different vocal tracts is not new. Several recent papers have reported on experiments with various scalings of the frequency axis.

Reference-contexts: The language model allows the string to consist of one or more of the digits plus "oh," optionally separated by silence. 4.1. Bark offset parameter Our PLP analysis follows that proposed by Hermansky <ref> [4] </ref>: Hamming-windowed FFT, warping of power spectrum to the Bark scale, critical-band masking, equal-loudness pre-emphasis, intensity-loudness conversion, then LPC cepstral analysis.

In our case we would use our existing recognizer to find the optimal offset for each training speaker, regenerate the neural network's training examples, retrain, redetermine the optimal offset for each training speaker, and so on until we obtain no further improvement.

Reference-contexts: Adaptation Task Since the recognizer was trained exclusively on adult speech, we test on children's speech to test the ability of our tech nique to adjust for vocal tract length differences. 5.1. Datasets Our baseline classifier was trained using adult utterances from the "train" subset of the TIDIGITS corpus <ref> [7] </ref>, a corpus of studio-quality connected-digit utterances. In this corpus, each speaker (adult or child) spoke 22 single-digit utterances and 11 each of 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 7-digit utterances, for a total of 77 utterances per speaker.

Reference-contexts: To keep things simple, we perform a linear minimization on the output score (a log likelihood) from our recognizer for the adaptation utterance as we vary the parameter value. We use Brent's algorithm <ref> [8, section 10.2] </ref>, a cross between the golden section search and parabolic interpolation, to perform the minimization.

Reference-contexts: Experiments on a telephone-based connected digit recognition task demonstrated a noticeable reduction in error rate. Another approach based on an ex-plicit voiced speech model is given by Wegmann, et al. <ref> [9] </ref>. Their piecewise-linear mapping produced a 12% reduction in error rates on a Switchboard task.
