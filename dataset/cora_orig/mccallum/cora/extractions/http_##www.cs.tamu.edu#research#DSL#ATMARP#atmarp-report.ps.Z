Abstract: 1 Progress Report on Quality of Service (QoS) Aware This progress report describes ongoing work on an Advanced Research Program funded by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. The title of this project is Quality of Service (QoS) Aware ATM Applications. The primary goal of this research is to investigate emerging standards for creating QoS aware ATM Applications, and to work with vendors and users in order to produce workable implementations. Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) communication technology promises to provide an integrated delivery system for voice, video, and data down to the desktop. ATM services include the ability to specify Quality of Service (QoS) on a connection basis. Most desktop implementations of ATM do not provide the capability for an application, such as a Web browser, to specify a desired QoS or to determine which QoS guarantees are available. We are examining the emerging standards for creating QoS aware ATM Applications. Our primary objectives are to test, implement, and prototype QoS-aware ATM applications, and develop new Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to support the provision of QoS over native ATM. We also are investigating ATM network management tools in order to evaluate the impact of various QoS requests on the network. In particular, we intend to examine applications that are of interest to our existing ATM testbed users, such as videoconferencing and stream video. We are exploring the use of Web-browser plug-ins as our implementation environment.

Reference-contexts: Using Fores XTI API specifications, we can develop applications running on the Solaris operating system that use the native ATM services in order to provide a guarantee on the data bandwidth as specified by a user. For more information on ForeThought see <ref> [FORE] </ref>. 2 Applications Development The Application Development group has developed two applications that provide end users with the ability to specify a desired QoS for an underlying ATM network connection.

Reference-contexts: We take the I.363 Recommendations available as a reference document. The exact title of this document is B-ISDN ATM ADAPTATION LAYER (AAL) SPECIFICATIONS. A temporary document I.363 B-ISDN Adaptation Layer Type 5 (AAL5) Specification is available online <ref> [I.363] </ref>. If we examine the structure of the AAL type 5 layer, in our case, it seems that there is no SSCS, because there is nothing that we can build a DRAFT VERSION 1 October 1998 14 NSAP/ASAP address.

Reference-contexts: Netperf is a benchmark tool that can be used to measure network performance. 4.3.1 Netperf The following basic information is from the Netperf documentation manual <ref> [NETPERF] </ref>: Netperf is designed around the basic clientserver model. There are two executables netperf and netserver. When you execute netperf, the first thing that will happen is the establishment of a control connection to the remote system.
