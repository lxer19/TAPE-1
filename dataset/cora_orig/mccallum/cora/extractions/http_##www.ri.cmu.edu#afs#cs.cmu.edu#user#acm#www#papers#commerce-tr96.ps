Reference-contexts: The sum of the standard credit card costs along with the cost of the computing time necessary for one transaction will probably turn out to be quite a large number. Unfortunately, Visa and MasterCard have not release estimated or actual performance figures for SET. 2.1.4 DigiCash DigiCash <ref> [1] </ref> uses RSA public key cryptography to provide strong, anonymous digital cash. One drawback to this system is the amount of processor time needed to complete transactions.

Reference-contexts: Given that current credit companies release information about their cardholders (credit record information, for instance), our assumptions may be somewhat unrealistic. Perhaps people who are concerned about their privacy will boycott overly loquacious credit companies. Since our system uses no munitions <ref> [2] </ref>, i.e. strong cryptography, it is exportable. While it may be desirable to encrypt traffic between the merchant and the customer, it is not necessary. For the security-conscious, our system can be easily converted to use a protocol such as secure sockets for communication between the merchant and customer.

Reference-contexts: The credit card company asks the cardholder's bank. The reply from the cardholder's bank filters back through the network to the merchant, who proceeds with the transaction. Billing information propagates from party to party in the same way. Finally, the cardholder's bank sends the cardholder a bill. <ref> [5] </ref> Payments take the opposite route through the system, beginning with the cardholder paying his bank. The cardholder's bank keeps 1.3% of the payment in addition to any interest that may have accrued if the cardholder did not pay right away. <p> The rest of the payment is sent to the credit card company, which charges the merchant's and cardholder's banks about five cents each. Finally, the payment is sent to the merchant's bank, which keeps 1.9% and sends the rest to the merchant. <ref> [5] </ref> The plan of action that credit card companies, specifically Visa [4], are CHAPTER 2.

Reference-contexts: It is probably safe to assume that the average transaction would take the merchant about half a second. At this rate, each transaction would cost the merchant five cents in computing time. For transactions below 25 cents, DigiCash's system would be very expensive. 2.1.5 Millicent Millicent <ref> [6] </ref> is a scheme for making tiny (less than one cent) purchases that seeks to evade the traditional difficulties with digital cash through decentralization. Instead of issuing money through banks, cash, now called scrip, is issued by each merchant. <p> Our system uses the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) because we believe it to be more secure than other well-known algorithms, e.g. MD5. With a hash function, it is easy to construct an almost unforgeable signature for a document (as shown in <ref> [6] </ref>). Call the document to be signed D. The signature of D is the one-way hash of the concatenation of D and a long sequence of random bits (call this B) known only by the person who signed the document.

Reference-contexts: Assuming a typical Internet commerce company needs to make roughly $300,000 per year per computer to pay for hardware maintenance and other expenses (this estimate was inspired by Manasse <ref> [7] </ref>), it would need to take in about one cent per second (a year has about 31.5 million seconds). 5 CHAPTER 2.

Reference-contexts: If the customer's computer is turned on when the attacker initiates a connection with the merchant, the merchant's packets to the customer's IP address will cause the customer's computer to reset the connection between the merchant and fake customer (assuming a TCP connection is used) <ref> [8] </ref>. Even if the customer's computer is off, the attacker will only get one order filled before the merchant stops trusting the spoofed customer. A more direct approach might be to steal the customer's identification number, secret bit string, and transaction counter.

Reference-contexts: Finally, there is the possibility that a brute force attack will succeed <ref> [9] </ref>. Having intercepted customer A's message, an evil hacker could try hashing every possible bit string concatenated with the message until he generated a signature identical to the one on the message. <p> If privacy is not an issue, no encryption at all is required, allowing transactions to be extremely fast. Our system successfully gives customers and merchants both convenience and security. 23 Appendix A Become a cryptographer in five minutes We will need to use a one-way hash function <ref> [9] </ref>, an algorithm that transforms an arbitrary amount of data into a set length (usually around 100 to 200 bits) of data. A good one-way hash function makes it very difficult either to find the input from the output or to find two inputs that share the same output.

Reference-contexts: The merchant and the cardholder are the only two parties who know what the cardholder is ordering. The system is heavily reliant on authentication through public key signatures, as distributed by a series of trust brokers. <ref> [10] </ref> A SET transaction bears a close resemblance to a standard credit card transaction. To initiate a purchase, a cardholder sends an order for some item to a merchant via the Internet. <p> The Issuer checks to see whether the cardholder is in good standing and returns the result, which propagates back to the merchant. The merchant has the choice of requesting payment in the same message as the request for approval, or in a separate message which takes the same path. <ref> [10] </ref> A whole transaction can be accomplished in six messages, but the number CHAPTER 2. BUILDING A COMMERCE SYSTEM 12 of messages can swell to 14 if a few optional but recommended pieces of the protocol are used. <p> Verification involves checking that the root certificate, which the cardholder holds, matches the signature on the next certificate, which matches the signature on the next certificate, etc., for three or four levels. At each level, another RSA decryption is necessary. <ref> [10] </ref> Whether or not SET is secure, it is certainly slow. The extensive use of public key cryptography guarantees that a transaction will take a significant amount of time to complete.

Reference-contexts: With a Visa card comes insurance, buyer protection, and many other bonuses. This approach is contrary to electronic payment systems, where the focus is only on producing a workable method to transfer money from the customer to the merchant. 2.1.2 First Virtual First Virtual's system <ref> [11] </ref>, known as the Green Commerce Model, is to be admired if for no other reason than that it is already in operation. The system's purpose is to allow consumers to use their credit cards over the Internet without fear that their card information will be stolen. <p> First Virtual's position is clear: Although use of cryptographic services could provide protection against masquerade, replay, and manipulation of the transfer-response message, the Internet community presently lacks the supporting infrastructure to deploy these services on a widespread basis. <ref> [11] </ref> Because of its lack of security as well as its heavy reliance on email, First Virtual's system is a veritable Swiss cheese of security holes.

SET's purpose is to enable credit cards to be used safely on the Internet. Care is taken to ensure that no party knows more than they should: All messages are encrypted via DES (with the DES key exchanged through RSA public key cryptography) to prevent third-party oberservers CHAPTER 2.
