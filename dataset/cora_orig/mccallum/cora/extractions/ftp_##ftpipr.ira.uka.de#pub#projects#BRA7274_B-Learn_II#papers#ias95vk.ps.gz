Abstract: The recognition of objects and, hence, their descriptions must be grounded in the environment in terms of sensor data. We argue, why the concepts, used to classify perceived objects and used to perform actions on these objects, should integrate action-oriented perceptual features and perception-oriented action features. We present a grounded symbolic representation for these concepts. Moreover, the concepts should be learned. We show a logic-oriented approach to learning grounded concepts.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 1 Levels of control Machine learning can be applied to robot technology in several ways. Consider a hierarchical control structure with different levels of behaviors as it is proposed by <ref> (Brooks, 1986) </ref> (Fig. 1). At all levels, perception-oriented and action-oriented processing is related. Machine learning can enhance the performance at each level. Biologically inspired work in robotics has developed artificial beings that adapt to their environment (Brooks, 1991; Steels, 1993). This type of learning is restricted to reflex-like behavior.

Reference-contexts: But it is easy to find arbitrarily many objects with these properties that are not cups because it is impossible to drink from them, e.g., if the handle bridges over the opening <ref> (De Jong and Mooney, 1986) </ref>. Finding a complete description of a cup excluding all exceptions is impossible because of the infinite number of these exceptions. This is the qualification problem (McCarthy and Hayes, 1969).

Reference-contexts: In this way, an action is expressed by perceptions. 3. DATA FROM THE NAVIGATION SCENARIO Before describing the representation hierarchy and the learning algorithms, we present the scenario and the robot we used for getting data. PRI-AMOS, developed by the University of Karl-sruhe <ref> (Dillmann et al., 1993) </ref>, is a mobile robot with three degrees of freedom for motion, i.e., it can move into every direction and rotate simultaneously. It has 24 sonar sensors measuring the distance to the nearest object within the emission cone.

Reference-contexts: But the applicability is described by perceptual features such as material, weight, handle, etc., not by action features proper. Gior-dana and Saitta have proposed to use executable features in concepts descriptions <ref> (Giordana and Saitta, 1990) </ref>. These features are true for an object, if a particular handling of this object is successful. For instance, the feature "movable" for a concept can be verified by moving that object.

Reference-contexts: Then, we give an overview of the representation hierarchy, based on the basic features. Finally, we show how learning can be applied to higher levels of the hierarchy. The used learning algorithm will not be described in detail (but see <ref> (Klingspor, 1994) </ref>). The reader may think of any learning algorithm for (restricted) first-order logic because, in principle, any first-order learning algorithm can solve our learning tasks. Note, that first-order learning is necessary in order to handle time intervals and their relations. <p> Until no negative (or only few) negative examples are covered, the next special rule schema is instantiated and tested. The most applicable learning algorithms were RDT (Ki-etz and Wrobel, 1992) and a modification of it, GRDT <ref> (Klingspor, 1994) </ref>. In a nutshell, the results are as follows. Given 1004 examples for the four sensor features, we learned 129 rules, covering 87% of the given examples. For learning sensor group features, we had given 956 examples, from which GRDT learned 136 rules.

Reference-contexts: Finding a complete description of a cup excluding all exceptions is impossible because of the infinite number of these exceptions. This is the qualification problem <ref> (McCarthy and Hayes, 1969) </ref>. So, how to define a cup suitably? The main issue of a cup is that you can drink from it. If a cup is defined as a receptacle from which drinking must be possible, the object classification can be verified by performing this action.

Reference-contexts: Machine learning can enhance the performance at each level. Biologically inspired work in robotics has developed artificial beings that adapt to their environment (Brooks, 1991; Steels, 1993). This type of learning is restricted to reflex-like behavior. Similarly, the system described by <ref> (Millan and Torras, 1992) </ref> operates on the reflexes level. It learns how to avoid obstacles and reacts very fast to sensory input, but higher levels of cognition such as reasoning and concept formation are excluded.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand it means, that they do not contain superfluous, redundant details, which would impair the recognition process by overloading it. The set of parameter settings can be considered as a version space <ref> (Mitchell, 1982) </ref> for learning basic features. The learning algorithm can be described by the following steps: 1. Start with a predefined set of parameters. 2. Calculate the basic features based on the function determined by the actual parameters. 3. Learn concept descriptions. 4.

Reference-contexts: of the action, it is defined as being front so that after completing the action the doorway is sensed by the opposite, the rear sensors. 4.3 Learning Perceptual Features Learning of higher-level features and, finally, of operational concepts is performed in the paradigm of inductive logic programming (ILP, see, e.g., <ref> (Muggleton, 1992) </ref>). The learning task is the following: Learning higher-level features: Given the target feature for various situations and background knowledge learn rules that characterize the target feature in terms of the background knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Nelson states, that ": : : , young children must represent their own roles and the roles of other and be able to reciprocate actions of the other with actions of their own, : : : " <ref> (Nelson, 1983, p. 135) </ref>. Objects should be represented as relations between actions and reactions, where an object implies a specific action, like a "ball implies throwing". Nelson regards three kinds of relations between objects and actors, where the two higher levels are the most appropriate ones in our scenario.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, learning at this lower level enables the system to react immediately to unexpected situations and thus decreases effort at higher levels. In order to enhance a robot's high-level processing, planning can be tailored to particular robot tasks by learning techniques <ref> (Segre, 1988) </ref>. Learning from failures of robot actions can be used to enhance the planning capabilities of a robot (Zercher, 1992; Bennett, 1989).

Reference-contexts: The learned concepts can then be used to formulate high-level commands and to control their execution <ref> (Wallner et al., 1994) </ref>. In this paper, we focus on two main properties of operational concepts: how they can be grounded in the environment (Sect. 2.1) and how to integrate perception and action (Sect. 2.2). In Section 3, we describe the data used for the experiments.

Reference-contexts: Concepts that cannot be described by these features can neither be described by newly built intermediate concepts, since intermediate concepts only simplify the representation, but do not enlarge the "closure of existing symbols" <ref> (Wrobel, 1991) </ref>. Until now, feature construction was programmed by an application developer.
