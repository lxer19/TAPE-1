Abstract: This paper proposes a method for characterising and comparing search algorithms. To illustrate the method we assess relaxation search and rule-based search on randomly-generated k-SAT problems. The performance of relaxation search is investigated by using an energy-function formulation of k-SAT problems and combining the methods of stochastic gradient descent and simulated annealing. Rule-based-search performance is studied by applying a version of the Davis-Putnam algorithm. For both search approaches, a performance analysis is done by varying the constraint density (i.e., the level of difficulty) and monitoring its effect on the search cost. At a critical value of the constraint density a c , a phase transition occurs from satisfiable to unsatisfiable instances. Focusing on the satisfiable instances we compare search costs of both approaches over a wide range of a-values: we define a scaling relation that maps both search curves onto a single rescaled search-cost curve. Our method allows for a quantitative comparison of search algorithms as a function of problem difficulty. The results are conjectured to be generalisable to other k-SAT problems which belong to the same universality class of optimisation problems. We conclude that our method allows for a quantitative characterisation and comparison of search algorithms in terms of a single scaling parameter.

Reference-contexts: In the context of statistical mechanics, Glauber dynamics are applied in simulating the behaviour of, for instance, Ising systems <ref> [Bin87] </ref>. At each iteration, the Glauber updating rule is applied to N randomly-selected variables. The random sequence is different for each iteration. A single simulation run is defined by an annealing schedule [KGV83].

Reference-contexts: As soon as the wf f contains an empty clause, however, the remaining wf f is unsatisfiable, and the algorithm backtracks and investigates the alternate value for the variable selected. Several enhancements of the Davis-Putnam algorithm have been suggested (see, e.g., <ref> [CA93] </ref>). The most effective (and mostly used) enhancement is called unit propagation which, briefly, prescribes that as soon as a unit clause appears (i.e., a clause with exactly one literal), the variable corresponding to that literal is chosen.

Reference-contexts: Then, in Section 3, we describe the two search algorithms. We determine and compare their search costs on satisfiability problems in Section 4. Conclusions are given in Section 5. 2 Satisfiability Problems A prototypical problem with varying difficulty is the propositional-satisfiability (SAT) problem (see, e.g., <ref> [Dew89] </ref>). The problem is to find an assignment to the variables of a logical formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF) that makes the formula true.

Reference-contexts: The energy function is zero if and only if all clauses are satisfied. For each unsatisfied clause, the energy increases with 1. Relaxation search performs a stochastic gradient descent on the energy surface defined by (1). The states (i.e., truth values) of individual variables are updated according to <ref> [Gla63] </ref>: P (S i ! S i ) = 1 + exp T ; (2) where P (S i ! S i ) is the probability that the i-th variable is negated and E (S i ) is the change in energy caused by the negation and is defined as E

Reference-contexts: In particular, the hardest problems are found near a critical value a c of the constraint density where (for large N ) a sharp transition from satisfiability to unsatisfiability occurs. Kirkpatrick, Gy orgyi, Tishby, and Troyansky <ref> [KGT93] </ref> investigated this phase transition in random k-SAT problems for k ranging from 2 to 6. They showed that the satisfiability curves for different values of k (and N ) can be mapped onto a single curve by applying a scaling operation. <p> These algorithms are very different and we would expect to see such differences reflected in the search-cost curves. Sections 3.1 and 3.2 describe relaxation search and rule-based search, respectively. 3.1 Relaxation Search We adopt the statistical-mechanics formalism to describe relaxation search applied to random k-SAT problems (cf. <ref> [KGT93] </ref>). The state vector is denoted by S and contains the states S i of the N variables. Variables have two states: S i = +1 corresponds to true and S i = 1 to false. <p> The transition from satisfiability to unsatisfiability occurs near a c . has been scaled to cover the range of values which makes it visually comparable to the graph in Figure 1a.) A similar effect on search cost is observed as with relaxation search. 4.3 Scaling of Search Curves Analogously to <ref> [KGT93] </ref>, we perform scaling on our data. We restrict ourselves to the satisfiable part of the data that is also the most reliable part: i.e., the interval a 2 [2:0; a c ]. <p> We conjecture that the value of the parameter rb;rel is also valid for closely related search problems, such as random k-SAT (k &gt; 3) which are likely to belong to the same universality class (see <ref> [KGT93] </ref>). We intend to perform such experiments to verify our conjecture. 5 Conclusion The proposed method of scaling forms a natural extension of the problem-dependent scaling approach that is now widely applied to constraint-satisfaction problems (e.g., [GW94]). In a small sample, as reported here, rb;rel can only be estimated roughly.

Box 1500, 9700 CD, Groningen backtracking search algorithm such as min forward checking may then be more efficient at finding a solution (see, e.g., <ref> [LH94] </ref>). As the example illustrates, an evaluation of the efficiency of search algorithms should take the difficulty of the problem into account. We propose a method in which the search efficiency of algorithms is evaluated at different levels of difficulty.

Reference-contexts: Basing ourselves on the analogy with statistical physics, we expect the value of the scaling parameter to be generalisable to other problems. Physical systems belonging to the same universality class (see, e.g., <ref> [Yeo92] </ref>) have identical scaling parameters. Similarly, problems belonging to the same universality class may have an identical scaling parameter rb;rel .
