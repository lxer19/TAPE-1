Abstract: This paper describes a perfect encryption algorithm which encodes a bit as a randomly generated boolean polynomial. The polynomials are generated from a truly random source. The algorithm is a generalised form of homophonic substitution. If the cycle length of the prng used as part of the key for the cipher is known the algorithm is still perfectly secure if the plaintext length is less than a certain multiple of the cycle length. That is the cipher is still perfectly secure if the key is only repeated according to the criteria of section 5.

Reference-contexts: Let OE be a pseudorandom number generator (prng from now on), where for a given seed k 2 B N and i 2 N, OE (k) (i) 2 B . Note that we do not require a cryptographically secure prng such as <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> for our purposes. Define the valuation v i : P n ! B as v i (p j ) = OE (k) (ni + j) This construction simply provides a way of using OE to generate a sequence of pseudorandom valuations on P n .

Reference-contexts: In [ 1 ] they require certain assumptions about how hard it is to analyse hash functions. There are also probabilistic encryption schemes which are provably semantically secure with certain number theoretic assumptions, such as <ref> [ 4 ] </ref> . All of these are perfectly good ciphers, and the assumptions they use are perfectly reasonable, but they are still assumptions. The one time pad provides perfect security but the key is essentially infinite.

Reference-contexts: Roughly speaking by asymptotic perfect security we mean that the probability of finding a key k such that (k; P ) = C tends to 1 as k increases in length. The one time pad <ref> [ 5 ] </ref> is the only perfect cipher in the public domain at the moment. This was invented in 1917 by Joseph Mauborgne and Gilbert Vernon. It has been widely used by some governments for highly sensitive material. The drawback of course is distributing the key.

Reference-contexts: Mersenne Twister Example So far all the discussion has been around proving security features of the cipher. This example illustrates the length of plaintext which can be encrypted using a single prng. Suppose the prng used as the key is something like the Mersenne Twister <ref> [ 6 ] </ref> it will be difficult to find ciphertext/plaintext pairs corresponding to the same valuation. Currently the Mersenne Twister has a cycle length of around 2 19937 . Choose for a key seed a bit string of 128 bits.

Reference-contexts: The allowable error in the reduced prng solution is 2 l . In practise this means finding reduced solutions which can miss 2 l of the orbits. This should happen quite fast as oe increases. Perhaps the class of linear feedback shift register (lfsr) prngs (see <ref> [ 7 ] </ref> section 6.2) will provide a safe class of prngs to use as keys? Given any sequence of length oe there is always an lfsr prng which generates it. So for this class of prngs the cipher is perfect.

Reference-contexts: Mitchell Asymptotic Perfect Encryption with Reduced Keys security. Asymptotically this is the case for the polynomial cipher as described in sections 7 and 7.1. Gauss <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> supposedly invented the idea of homophones in the nineteenth century. His idea was to allow a symbol of plaintext to be identified with a set of symbols known as homophones.
