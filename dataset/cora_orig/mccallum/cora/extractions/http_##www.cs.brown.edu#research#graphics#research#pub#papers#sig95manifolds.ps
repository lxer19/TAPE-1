Title: Modeling Surfaces of Arbitrary Topology using Manifolds

Abstract: We describe an extension of B-splines to surfaces of arbitrary topology, including arbitrary boundaries. The technique inherits many of the properties of B-splines: local control, a compact representation, and guaranteed continuity of arbitrary degree. The surface is specified using a polyhedral control mesh instead of a rectangular one; the resulting surface approximates the polyhedral mesh much as a B-spline approximates its rectangular control mesh. Like a B-spline, the surface is a single, continuous object. This is achievedby modeling the domain of the surface with a manifold whose topology matches that of the polyhedral mesh, then embedding this domain into 3-space using a basis-function/control-point formulation. We provide a constructive approach to building a manifold.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Surfaces of arbitrary topology are currently attracting a good deal of attention. While spline surfaces have proven a powerful modeling tool <ref> [BBB87] </ref> [Far88], modeling topologically arbitrary surfaces with them is hard, because they require a rectangular parameterization. To create complex surfaces, especially free-form ones such as Figure 17, we need a surface model which is computation-ally inexpensive and yet capable of modeling arbitrary topologies.

Reference-contexts: We call this a proto-manifold. From the proto-manifold we build a manifold using an equivalence relation, i.e., we glue the charts together using this place on this chart is the same as that place on that other chart. In <ref> [Gri] </ref> we show that this definition is equivalent to the traditional one. Definition 1 A C k differentiable proto-manifold K of dimension n consists of: 1. A finite set A of connected open sets in &lt; n . A is called a proto-atlas. <p> Conditions (1)-(3) in Definition 1 ensure that ~ is an equivalence relation <ref> [Gri] </ref>. <p> Define M as the quotient of t c2A c by ~. Let be the map taking x 2 t c2A c to [x] 2 M , where [x] is the equivalence class of x. In <ref> [Gri] </ref> we prove under weak conditions satisfied in the construction below that M is a Hausdorff space upon which we can construct a traditional manifold structure. <p> do the blend.) Care must be taken to ensure that this function is 1-1, onto, and C k ; details of this (and the other functions) are given in Appendix C. 6.3 The manifold A formal proof that these charts and transition functions form a proto-manifold (Definition 1) appears in <ref> [Gri] </ref>. Informally, the charts are defined to be open sets in &lt; 2 and the transition functions are defined to be 1-1, onto, and C k . <p> The singularities of ' V F 0 lie on a line that does not intersect ' EF 0 (U EV U EF 1 ) <ref> [Gri] </ref>. Therefore the composite function can be extended to the region U EV U EF 1 . A similar argument holds for ' EF 1 . <p> In <ref> [Gri] </ref> we show that ' EV is invertible and 1-1 on U V E . D Dual of first subdivision surface Given a polyhedron P , the first subdivision surface P 0 of P contains a vertex for every vertex, edge, and face of P (see Figure 15).

Reference-contexts: Subdivision [CC78] [Loo87] produces a smooth surface by repeatedly subdividing a polyhedral mesh and in the limit yields a G 1 surface. This method is very general, but does not admit an analytical form (although recent work <ref> [HDK93] </ref> has made subdivision more tractable). Another approach is to fill in any non-rectangular parts of a mesh with n-sided patches [HM90] [LD89]. This is analogous to Bezier surfaces, in that it ensures continuity across the boundaries of patches by maintaining constraints on control points.

Reference-contexts: Where the path must cross from one page to another, the two pages overlap enough that one can locate oneself on the second page. The individual pages are regions of &lt; 2 but taken together they represent a sphere <ref> [MYV93] </ref>. There are also implicitly defined transition functions from one page to another. These are the glue we use to glue the pages together; they establish a correspondence between the region of one page and a region of another.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the polyhedron must be orientable, i.e., it must contain no embedded Mobius strips. These technical restrictions make the polyhedron an oriented surface in the sense of algebraic topology <ref> [Spa66] </ref>. Finally, we require that each face have 3, 4, 5, or 6 edges.

Reference-contexts: The coloring of Image 18 was determined by running a reaction-diffusion simulation on the manifold and using the resulting chemical concentrations to create the stripes <ref> [Tur91] </ref>. Because the embedding defines a metric on the manifold, we can use either that global metric or the local (chart) metric with the reaction-diffusion equations. This surface technique produces aesthetically pleasing models fairly efficiently and easily.
