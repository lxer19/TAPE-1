Title: Experiments in Multilingual Information Retrieval using the SPIDER system  
Author: Paraic Sheridan, Jean Paul Ballerini

Abstract: We introduce a new approach to multilingual information retrieval based on the use of thesaurus-based query expansion techniques applied over a collection of comparable multilingual documents. This approach has been built into the SPIDER information retrieval system and has been tested over a large collection of Italian documents. We have shown that the SPIDER system retrieves Italian documents in response to user queries written in German with better effectiveness than a baseline system evaluating Italian queries against Italian documents. Although the importantance of the SPIDER stemming algorithm for Italian must be stressed in these results, we have also achieved performance on multilingual retrieval tasks within 32% of the best SPIDER performance on Italian retrieval, by including a relevance feedback loop in the task of multilingual retrieval.

Reference-contexts: We therefore decided to take a completely dictionary-based approach to German word normal-isation. We made use of the German lexicon of the CELEX CD-ROM available from the Linguistic Data Consortium <ref> [Baayen et al., 1993] </ref>, which contains roughly 360,000 German wordforms linked to 51,000 stems. Word normalisation is then a simple lookup procedure, retrieving from the dictionary the lemma for a given wordform.

Reference-contexts: received much attention over the past number of years, and which we feel we may be able to exploit in performing multilingual retrieval, is the use of corpus processing techniques to automatically construct thesaurus-like information structures for use in query expansion (e.g. [Schauble and Knaus, 1992], [Qiu and Frei, 1993], <ref> [Jing and Croft, 1994] </ref>). This approach to query expansion generally involves the use of term co-occurence statistics across the document collection to determine a set of document terms related in some sense to the query terms.

Reference-contexts: The following definitions and distinctions will be useful in describing our approach: Comparable Documents: "texts which, though composed independently in the respective language communities, have the same communicative function" [Laf-fling, 1992] (see also <ref> [Peters and Picchi, 1996] </ref>). To give a concrete example, comparable documents in our news collection are those news documents that report on the same event or topic (in different languages) on the same day, even though they were written indepen dently and are not translations of each other.

Reference-contexts: the different nature of each language, we have taken a different approach to each, as follows: 2.1 Italian word normalisation Through analysis of a large corpus sample of Italian words, we determined that it would be possible to formulate a rule-based stemming algorithm for Italian, much like the Porter algorithm <ref> [Porter, 1980] </ref> that is commonly used for English word reduction. Since Italian is much more morphologically rich than English though, the number of rules required for stemming is much greater than the Porter algorithm for English.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction As far back as the early 1970's Prof. Gerard Salton at Cor-nell University performed experiments to investigate the feasibility of multilingual information retrieval ([Salton, 1970], <ref> [Salton, 1972] </ref>); i.e. retrieving documents that may not be written in the same language as the query. He used a manually constructed multilingual thesaurus to assign concept categories to terms, ensuring that equivalent words in the different languages were assigned the same concept categories.

Reference-contexts: To introduce the multilingual aspect, we submitted 50 German queries to our Italian subcollection and compared the results to those obtained by submitting equivalent Italian queries. Our experiments were run using the SPIDER information retrieval system <ref> [Schauble, 1993] </ref> which has a client-server architecture. The simplest way to run our experiments was to use two different servers, one giving access to the collection of multilingual documents and one giving access to the Italian documents. Given this architecture, multilingual retrieval proceeds as follows: 1.
