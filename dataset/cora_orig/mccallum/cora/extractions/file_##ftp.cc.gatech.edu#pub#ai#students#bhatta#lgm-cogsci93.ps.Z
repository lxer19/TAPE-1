Abstract: Humans appear to often solve problems in a new domain by transferring their expertise from a more familiar domain. However, making such cross-domain analogies is hard and often requires abstractions common to the source and target domains. Recent work in case-based design suggests that generic mechanisms are one type of abstractions used by designers. However, one important yet unexplored issue is where these generic mechanisms come from. We hypothesize that they are acquired incrementally from problem-solving experiences in familiar domains by generalization over patterns of regularity. Three important issues in generalization from experiences are what to generalize from an experience, how far to generalize, and what methods to use. In this paper, we show that mental models in a familiar domain provide the content, and together with the problem-solving context in which learning occurs, also provide the constraints for learning generic mechanisms from design experiences. In particular, we show how the model-based learning method integrated with similarity-based learning addresses the issues in generalization from experiences.

Reference-contexts: Further, similarities between regularities in experiences determine how abstract a learned generic mechanism can be. Elsewhere we show how our computational model also accounts for the acquisition of other types of "abstract concepts," such as mental models of physical principles, physical processes, and device prototypes <ref> (Bhatta & Goel, 1992) </ref>. Finally, from the computational model we can predict that if they have the models of specific devices, human designers can easily learn the models of generic mechanisms from their design experiences and use the learned mechanisms for mak ing cross-domain analogies.

Reference-contexts: Case-Specific SBF Models IDeAL's models of specific devices are represented in the form of structure-behavior-function (SBF) models. These models are based on a component-substance ontology <ref> (Bylander, 1991) </ref>. In this ontology, the structure of a device is viewed as constituted of components and substances. Substances have locations in reference to the components in the device. They also have behavioral properties, such as voltage of electricity, and corresponding parameters, such as 1.5 volts, 3 volts, etc.

Reference-contexts: model-based approach to learning is similar to Winston's model (1982) which shows that learning can be done by analogically transferring causal links in the explanation of an example to the target "concept." Our approach is also similar to explanation-based methods such as EBG (Mitchell, Keller, & Kedar-Cabelli, 1986) and EBL <ref> (DeJong & Mooney, 1986) </ref> in using explanations (SBF models) to constrain the learning of concepts. However, most of these systems assume some knowledge of the target concept a priori; our model-based approach attempts to "discover" them.

Reference-contexts: Substances have locations in reference to the components in the device. They also have behavioral properties, such as voltage of electricity, and corresponding parameters, such as 1.5 volts, 3 volts, etc. This ontology gives rise to a behavioral representation language <ref> (Goel, 1989) </ref> for describing the SBF model of a design that is a generalization on functional representation scheme (Sembugamoorthy & Chandrasekaran, 1986; Chandrasekaran, Goel, & Iwasaki, 1993). 1 IDeAL stands for Integrated "DEsign by Analogy and Learning." The constituents of the SBF model are described below. <p> We are currently testing IDeAL with design problems from other domains such as reaction wheel assemblies, and for other mechanisms such as feedback and feedforward. Related Work This work on IDeAL evolves from our earlier work on KRITIK <ref> (Goel, 1989) </ref>. IDeAL's component-substance ontology, SBF models, and behavioral representation language all are borrowed from KRITIK. The problem-solving component of IDeAL evolves from KRITIK2 (Stroulia et al., 1992). Learning Task: Few computational models of analogical reasoning have addressed learning of high-level abstractions.

Reference-contexts: of a sequence of several states and state transitions at a different level as shown in Case-Independent BF Models Generic Teleological Mechanisms (GTMs) are one type of knowledge that designers use in adaptive design, that is, in modifying an old design by insertion of specific patterns of components (or substructures) <ref> (Stroulia & Goel, 1992) </ref>. Examples of GTMs are cascading, feedback, and feedfor-ward. GTMs are teleological because they result in specific functions and are generic because they are case independent. <p> More specifically, Figure 4 illustrates how IDeAL instantiated the cascading mechanism learned from the two designs, EC1.5 and EC3, in the water pumps in designing a nitric acid cooler that provides a higher range of cooling (i.e., T 1 -T 2 0 ). <ref> (Stroulia & Goel, 1992) </ref> provides more details of the adaptation process. Together, these experiments indicate the utility and effectiveness of our model-based method for learning GTMs: the SBF models enable learning of GTMs in one domain and the learned BF models of GTMs facilitate designing in another. <p> Related Work This work on IDeAL evolves from our earlier work on KRITIK (Goel, 1989).
