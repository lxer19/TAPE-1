Abstract: This paper presents a perception-based navigation mechanism that facilitates mobile robot self-localisation and determination of novel routes across uncharted territory. During a training phase "virtual coordinates" are associated with perceived landmarks, and subsequently used for spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that a good correspondence between virtual coordinates and true Cartesian coordinates can be achieved, and that localisation and path planning are therefore possible by means of the virtual coordinates associated with perceptual landmarks.
