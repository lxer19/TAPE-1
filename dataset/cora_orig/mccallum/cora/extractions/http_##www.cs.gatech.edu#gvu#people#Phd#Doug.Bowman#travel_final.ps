Abstract: We present a categorization of techniques for first-person motion control, or travel, through immersive virtual environments, as well as a framework for evaluating the quality of different techniques for specific virtual environment tasks. We conduct three quantitative experiments within this framework: a comparison of different techniques for moving directly to a target object varying in size and distance, a comparison of different techniques for moving relative to a reference object, and a comparison of different motion techniques and their resulting sense of disorientation in the user. Results indicate that pointing techniques are advantageous relative to gazedirected steering techniques for a relative motion task, and that motion techniques which instantly teleport users to new locations are correlated with increased user disorientation.

Reference-contexts: Introduction), we are able to categorize these techniques in an organized design space (similar to <ref> [1] </ref>). Figure 1 shows the high-level entries in our taxonomy. There are three components in a travel technique, each of which corresponds to a design decision that must be made by the implementor.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the follow-up experiments discussed above, we would like to create a more general testbed for VE travel techniques. Our plans call for creation of a test environment similar to the Virtual Environment Performance Assessment Battery (VEPAB) <ref> [7] </ref>. This environment would be instrumented to collect data on any or all of the quality factors we discussed. Specific travel techniques would then be used in these environments and assigned an overall score for each of the quality factors.

Reference-contexts: Two constant velocity techniques were used, with the fast velocity ten times greater than the slow velocity. A third technique was infinite velocity, where the user is taken directly to the destination. Finally, we implemented a slow-in, slow-out (SISO) technique (similar to <ref> [8] </ref>) in which the user begins slowly, accelerates to a maximum speed, then decelerates as the destination is reached.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, a more general direction/target selection technique is needed that still maintains acceptable speed and accuracy characteristics. Two of the most common techniques used in VE applications are gazedirected steering and hand-directed steering (or pointing) <ref> [10] </ref>. In gazedirected steering, the users view vector (typically the orientation of the head tracker) is used as the direction of motion, whereas the direction is obtained from the users hand orientation in the pointing technique.
