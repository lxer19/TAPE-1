Abstract: We describe a model-based object recognition system that uses a probabilistic model for recognizing and locating objects. For each major view class of each 3D object, a probability model consisting of triplets of visible features, their parametrization, and their frequency of detection is constructed from a set of synthetic training images. These synthetic probability models are used to recognize and locate the 3D object from real 2D camera images. The features captured from the real images are then used to create a new, more accurate probability model. Keywords: Model-based recognition, probability models.

We use a probabilistic approach for evaluating partial matches, and our approach is related to PREMIO system of Camps [3], which constructs view-dependent probability models that incorporate the errors due to the interplay of surface reflectance properties, lighting conditions, and image processing operators.

Reference-contexts: Knowing the pose gives us a way of verifying the correctness of the match using 3D knowledge. 2.2 Feature triplets Our use of a succinct set of features, such as line triplets, as the basis for matching is motivated by the local feature focus method <ref> [2] </ref>. Our method is also related to representative patterns [9], but in our work, the line triplets are parametrized in a way that is invariant to translations, rotations and scaling on a plane.

Reference-contexts: CAD-model-based systems begin with geometric models of the 3D objects; these are used to determine features that can be used in the recognition process [1, 4, 7, 10, 13]. We use a probabilistic approach for evaluating partial matches, and our approach is related to PREMIO system of Camps <ref> [3] </ref>, which constructs view-dependent probability models that incorporate the errors due to the interplay of surface reflectance properties, lighting conditions, and image processing operators. The system described in this paper is called TRIBORS (Triplet-Based Object Recognition System). Like PRE-MIO, TRIBORS uses synthesized images to create probability models for matching. <p> image 3 17 3 17 3 17 3 17 3 17 synth 14.3 12.2 11.1 9.3 17.6 23.3 12.0 16.5 11.6 21.9 14.98 real 17.5 11.6 12.2 12.2 33.8 44.6 14.7 15.8 19.3 37.5 21.92 5 Conclusions The TRIBORS system uses the probability model concept developed by Camps for PREMIO <ref> [3] </ref>, but employs a hypothesize-and-test matching scheme that matches parametrized model triplets to similar image triplets. Although implemented only for triplets of line segments, the method is equally applicable to triplets of other features, as long as each feature has a detectable distinguished point, such as a centroid.

Reference-contexts: The next step is to obtain an initial estimate for the pose of the object. Our matching method does not depend on any particular pose estimation algorithm. We used an iterative, point-to-point, correspondence-based exterior orientation algorithm described in <ref> [8] </ref>. 3.3 Match verification So far we have guessed the identity of an object and its pose based on a small set of features. Now we need to verify that hypothesis.

Reference-contexts: The idea of view classes is very close to aspect graphs (see, e.g., [6]), but our formulation leads to far fewer view classes for an object than there would be aspects in an aspect graph. The determination of the correct view class could be done by geometric hashing <ref> [12] </ref> where some salient features vote for the directions where they can be observed, or the application can be one where only a few different view classes are possible.
