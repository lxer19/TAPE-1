Abstract: Agents can benefit from contracting some of their tasks that cannot be performed by themselves or that can be performed more efficiently by other agents. Developing an agents contracting strategy in the University of Michigan Digital Library (UMDL), however, is not easy for the following reasons. The UMDL consists of self-interested agents who will perform a task of another agents only when doing it is their own interests. In addition, multiple contracts take place concurrently such that other contracts currently in the system may have an impact on the success of ones own contract. Therefore, an agent who has a task (contractor) needs to model what the other self-interested agents think and will do, and it also needs to consider the influence of other contracts on its contract. In this paper, we define the contractors and the contractees decision problems in the UMDL contracting situations, and present a contracting strategy by which a contractor can determine an optimal payment to offer. The contractors problem is to find a payment that maximizes its expected utility, and it finds such a payment by modeling the contracting process stochastically using a Markov process. The Markov-process model is built based on the information the contractor has about the potential contractees and about the other contracts in the system. Our early results show that the contractor receives a higher utility when thinking about the potential contractees and the other contracts.

Reference-contexts: One example of such federated multiagent systems is the University of Michigan Digital Library (UMDL), a large-scale multiagent system for information services <ref> (Atkins et al. 1996) </ref> . The agents in the UMDL coordinate their activities to accomplish a variety of high-valued information services, such as delivering a document to a user, processing a query, filtering information, and so on. <p> Typically, the TPA processes a task from a user, and the RA monitors a UMDL event (e.g., the change of the status of an agent) <ref> (Atkins et al. 1996) </ref>. where P S/F denote the probability of Success (S) and Failure (F) of a contract, and Payoff S/F denote the payoff of S and F, respectively, given r. Note that Payoff S/F is a more-is-better function since in general the contractor will prefer a higher payoff.

Reference-contexts: Self-interested agents strategies have been studied in DAI as well. Rosenschein, for example, proposes several agent strategies and protocols based on game theory (Rosenschein & Zlotkin 1994). In RMM <ref> (Gmytrasiewicz & Durfee 1993) </ref> , an agent models the other agents in a recursive manner to evaluate the expected utility attached to potential actions. Kraus proposes a self-interested agents contracting strategy based on contingency contracts (Kraus 1994).

Kraus proposes a self-interested agents contracting strategy based on contingency contracts <ref> (Kraus 1994) </ref>. At the risk of oversimplifying, we say that the above research in general focuses on a singletask contracting situation of self-interested agents. The UMDL, however, consists of multiple contracts, which demands a contracting strategy that explicitly reasons about concurrent contracts and possible retractions.

Reference-contexts: Second, if contracted, it needs to decide whether to retract some of its contracted tasks. Since our primary focus is on the optimal contracting strategy of the contractor, we do not discuss the detailed way of computing the contractees payoffs in this paper. Interested readers may refer to <ref> (Park, Durfee, & Birmingham 1996) </ref>. First, when the tasks are being announced, the contractee needs to find a subset of announced tasks it will accept the subset of announced tasks which maximizes its expected payoff. <p> The detailed explanation can be found in <ref> (Park, Durfee & Birmingham 1996) </ref>. with different payments of T 2 ( r 2 ), assuming the initial state is state 14. Depending on the payment of the other task, the contractors optimal payment would be different.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, there has been little research on self-interested agents contracting strategies under multiple, concurrent contracts. Sen (Sen 1993) has studied multiple contracts and their interdependencies, but his research primarily deals with cooperative domains and lacks explicit notions of payments. Sandholm proposes self-interested agents contracting strategies under multiple contracts <ref> (Sandholm 1993) </ref> . Compared to our approach, however, the contractor announces the true cost of its task as the payment, not capitalizing on the opponents costs or the impact of the other tasks competing in the system. In addition, retraction is not allowed.

Reference-contexts: In addition, retraction is not allowed. Recently, he proposes a leveled-commitment protocol that allows self-interested agents to retract from a contract by paying a penalty <ref> (Sandholm & Lesser 1995b) </ref>, but no agents strategy under such a protocol is developed yet. In our work, both the contractor and the contractee are able to explicitly consider the opponents, the concurrent contracts, and the possibility of retraction when making decisions in the contracting process.
