Abstract: Different signal realizations generated from a given source may not appear the same. Time shifts, frequency shifts, and scales are among the signal variations commonly encountered. Time-frequency distributions (TFDs) covariant to time and frequency shifts and scale changes reflect these variations in a predictable manner. Based on such TFDs, representations invariant to these signal distortions are possible. Presented here are two approaches for discriminating between signal classes where within class translation and scale variation occur. The first method uses an auto-correlation followed by a scale transform to achieve the invari-ances. The second method treats the TFD as a two-dimensional probability density function and applies a transformation that removes the mean and variance to provide the shift and scale invariance. Each method employs discrimination mechanisms to yield powerful results.

Reference-contexts: Powerful techniques exist for their detection and classification, but these techniques are often defeated by variations in the signature. These variations include scaling and shifting in time and frequency. All time-frequency distributions (TFDs) in Cohen's class are covariant to time shifts and frequency shifts <ref> [1] </ref>. There exists a subset of Cohen's class that is also covariant to scale changes. Similar to [3], we will call this class the shift-scale covariant class. Reduced interference distributions (RIDs), introduced by Williams and Jeong [7], are a subset of the shift covariant class.

Reference-contexts: Direct scale transform The 2D autocorrelation function of a RID provides in-variance to time and frequency shift and a stable origin. A discrete scale transform implementation can additionally provide scale invariance. The scale transform, introduced by Cohen <ref> [2] </ref>, is a specific case of the Mellin transform with the key property that for signals of equal energy the magnitude of their scale transforms are invariant to scaling effects.

Methods can be designed that transform shift scale covariant This research has been supported in part by the Office of Naval Research, ONR contract nos. N00014-90-J-1654 and N00014-97-1-0072. <p> Obviously, with the added noise, discrimination between the signals is difficult in either the time or frequency domain. In order to achieve the frequency shift invariance using TFDs, the analytic signals of the real valued data sequences were used. Calculating the binomial TFD <ref> [7] </ref> and applying the two detection mechanisms yields the receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) shown in Figure 2. It appears that the STIR method could provide better performance as a detector over the moment method. However, the moment method has a lower computational complexity.
