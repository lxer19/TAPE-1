Abstract: We consider the problem of computing invariant functions of the image of a set of points or line segments in &lt; 3 under projection. Such functions are in principle useful for machine vision systems, because they allow different images of a given geometric object to be described by an invariant `key'. We show that if a geometric object consists of an arbitrary set of points or line segments in &lt; 3 , and the object can undergo a general rotation, then there are no invariants of its image under projection. For certain constrained rotations, however, there are invariants (e.g., rotation about the viewing direction). Thus we precisely delimit the conditions for the existence or nonexistence of invariants of arbitrary sets of points or line segments under projection.

Reference-contexts: A number of papers in the computer vision literature have recently considered the question of the existence of nontrivial invariants of three-dimensional objects under projection into the plane. One of these works <ref> [1] </ref> concludes after somewhat lengthy arguments that there are no (nontrivial) invariants of finite point sets in &lt; 3 under Euclidean motion and central projection. Another paper [2] makes an informal argument that there cannot be invariants under orthographic projection from &lt; 3 into &lt; 2 . <p> Then the result follows immediately from Lemma 1. This result is a generalization of the claims in <ref> [1] </ref> and [2], on the nonexistence of invariants under central and orthographic projection. Our proof of this fact is very simple and does not rely on any degeneracies, such as multiple collinear or coplanar points.

Reference-contexts: In order to compute such viewpoint-independent descriptions, a number of recent investigations have applied techniques from classical invariant theory (e.g., <ref> [3, 6, 7, 8] </ref>). Invariant theory is a branch of algebra concerned with functions for which the value of the function remains unchanged after it is composed with members of some distinguished set of functions H (cf. [4]). <p> Such invariants do exist in certain cases, and have been successfully applied to a number of model-based recognition problems (in which geometric models of known objects are compared against an image containing unknown objects) <ref> [3, 7] </ref>. The classical theory, however, studies invariants with respect to sets of functions that form a group. In particular, this means that each function in the set H must have an inverse also in the set.

Reference-contexts: Invariant theory is a branch of algebra concerned with functions for which the value of the function remains unchanged after it is composed with members of some distinguished set of functions H (cf. <ref> [4] </ref>). For example, a function f on the elements of some set S is invariant with respect to H, if f (x) = f (h (x)) for all x 2 S, h 2 H.

Reference-contexts: A third paper makes a more rigorous argument that there cannot be invariants under orthographic projection from &lt; 3 into &lt; 2 , and investigates certain restricted object classes where there are invariants (e.g., symmetric sets) <ref> [5] </ref>. None of these investigations precisely characterizes the conditions for the existence of invariants for point sets under projection, nor do they consider sets of line segments. <p> Other restricted object classes for which there are invariants under projection are considered in <ref> [5] </ref>. It seems that a promising idea would be to define classes of three-dimensional objects more general than coplanar point sets for which invariant-based techniques are still of use.

One notable exception is the work of <ref> [7] </ref> who develops invariants of orthographic projections of three orthogonal vectors in space. In this paper we investigate the problem of computing invariants of the two-dimensional images of geometric objects in three-space.
