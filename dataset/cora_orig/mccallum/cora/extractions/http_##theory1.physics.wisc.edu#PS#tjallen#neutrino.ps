Abstract: We derive explicit forms for the neutrino and lepton "mixing-matrices" which describe the generic singular see-saw model. The dependence on the hierarchy parameter is contrasted with the non-singular case. Application is made to Simpson's 17 keV neutrino.

Introduction Very recently, the deduction from the measured end point spectrum of nuclear beta decay by Simpson <ref> [1] </ref> of about a 10% (in amplitude) "contamination" of the electron neutrino with a different neutrino of mass 17 keV has been supported by other groups. [2] These are difficult experiments but, if correct, they have very profound implications for our understanding of electro-weak interactions.

Reference-contexts: The new observations seem puzzling according to usual theoretical models and expectations. In the first place the neutrino masses are expected to be in the range 10 4 to 10 2 eV in order to explain the observed solar neutrino flux with the resonant oscillation mechanism. <ref> [10] </ref> The 17 keV mass is far enough away from these values to suggest the existence of another new scale in weak interaction physics. <p> In the initial attempts [12] to explain Simpson's neutrino it was postulated that the three two-component fields for the three generations should be regarded as one very light -e and nearly degenerate and- t at 17 keV . This is notsuitable y current explanation <ref> [10] </ref> of the solar neutrino flux which requires two light neutrinos. The minimal set of two-component neutrino fields required is thus four | two for solar flux and two for fifi 0- . <p> New phenomena associated with m (-3 ) 6= m (-4 ) are expected [7;9] in -e $ -t and - $ -t oscillations. From Simpson's experiment [1;2] we may estimate jK 13 j = jK 14 j 0:1= p should be obtained from the -e $ oscillation explanation <ref> [10] </ref> of the solar neutrino flux deficit, while jK 23 j = jK 24 j &lt; ~ 0:25 from the lack of observation [23] It seems worth emphasizing that a (3; 1) model is the minimal one needed to explain the solar flux and fifi 0- data.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, when one recognizes that the general (or "natural") massive neutrino in gauge theories is of the two-component "Majorana" type, it becomes a puzzle to understand why a 17 keV neutrino mixing with eat the 10% level does not strongly violate the experimental bound <ref> [11] </ref> on neutrinoless double beta decay (fifi 0-). The only way out would be to have two Majorana neutrinos whose contributions cancel each other. If the two are degenerate, or nearly so, they effectively combine to be one of Dirac type.

Reference-contexts: 1 H D T . (Note that D and M H are being taken of the same order so that * is explicitly displayed.) y However such an explanation might be viable if one were able to explain [13] the reduction of the solar neutrino flux by neutrino flavor-spin rotation <ref> [14] </ref> in the sun's magnetic field. 2 One option for explaining Simpson's neutrino in a parallel generation framework is simply to give up the "new physics" scale by setting M H = 0. Then all three neutrinos would be of Dirac type.

Reference-contexts: But, considering just four neutrino fields is unaesthetic in the sense that it disagrees with the parallel generation structure observed for the other fermi fields in nature. Ordinarily, one's intuition about massive neutrinos is guided by the see-saw mechanism <ref> [15] </ref> in which two two-component fields for each generation are assumed and where the 6 fi 6 mass matrix has the structure M = M T = 0 *D ! The "heavy" mass matrix M H has a scale corresponding to some "new physics." There are three superheavy neutrinos and three

Reference-contexts: Then all three neutrinos would be of Dirac type. This does not explain why -t is so much heavier than -e and - . Several years ago, in a study of the way M H could be related to the mass matrices of the charged fermions, it was found <ref> [16] </ref> that M H tended to come out close to a singular matrix (of rank 2). <p> It is to be hoped that such symmetries would lead to a deeper understanding at the GUT or perhaps even superstring level. Indeed, the possibility of a singularity was suggested <ref> [16] </ref> by considering a GUT framework. Finally the origin of the particular value of the hierarchy parameter, * ~ 10 7 is an interesting question; perhaps it suggests a "radiative" mechanism.

Reference-contexts: Of special interest are the possible decay modes of the 17 keV neutrino. Astrophysical and cosmological criteria necessitate a relatively quick decay. One promising mode is a decay such as -t ! - + J , where J is the Majoron, <ref> [17] </ref> true Goldstone boson associated with spontaneous breakdown of lepton number. A nave estimate would suggest that the amplitude for this process goes as * 2 , which is sufficiently rapid for * ~ m (- )=m (-t ) ~ 10 7 . <p> Eq. (2.7) is basic for the following. At present only W is not explicit. 3. Majoron decay modes It was pointed out [16;3] that introducing a Majoron field J could promote the viability of the present scheme by providing a rapid decay mode <ref> [17] </ref> such as -t ! - + J. We will focus our attention on the simplest Majoron model | the singlet Majoron. [17] If the ordinary non-singular see-saw is employed, the decay is suppressed by the Goldstone nature of J, unfortunately. <p> Majoron decay modes It was pointed out [16;3] that introducing a Majoron field J could promote the viability of the present scheme by providing a rapid decay mode <ref> [17] </ref> such as -t ! - + J.

Reference-contexts: A nave estimate would suggest that the amplitude for this process goes as * 2 , which is sufficiently rapid for * ~ m (- )=m (-t ) ~ 10 7 . However there is a subtlety due to the Goldstone nature of J and it turns out <ref> [18] </ref> that for the non-singular see-saw the amplitude is suppressed to order * 4 , which is not sufficient. We will explicitly show how the singular see-saw restores the * 2 order for the amplitude. <p> We will explicitly show how the singular see-saw restores the * 2 order for the amplitude. Similarly the amplitude for -t ! 3- due to Z boson exchange, which is of order * 2 for the non-singular see-saw, <ref> [18] </ref> will be shown to be enhanced to order * in the singular case. The transformation matrix is derived in Sec. 2 and applied to the Majoron decay modes in Sec. 3. <p> the Majoron Yukawa coupling constants of the four "light" neutrinos is given by the upper left sub-block in (3.3); using (3.2) and (2.6) we obtain 1 U T ~ R T M ~ RU c x * W T AW: (3:4) At this stage we may recover the old result <ref> [18] </ref> for the non-singular see-saw by noting that the calculation in that case is structurally the same as the present one except that the second term on the right side of eq. (3.4) is absent. <p> This is in contrast to the * 4 amplitude <ref> [18] </ref> in the non-singular case. <p> The partial width for this mode is then about 10 11 sec 1 . 4. Other decay modes In the non-singular see-saw model the amplitude for a decay like -t ! -e + 2 mediated by Z boson exchange is <ref> [18] </ref> of order * 2 . We will see that this amplitude is also enhanced for the singular case.
