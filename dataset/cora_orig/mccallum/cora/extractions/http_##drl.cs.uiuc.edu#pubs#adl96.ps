Title: Authorization in the Digital Library: Secure Access to Services across Enterprise Boundaries  
Author: Neil Ching Vicki Jones Marianne Winslett

Abstract: In large-scale networked information systems (e.g. the World-Wide Web), the community of subjects who may make requests to a service provider such as a digital library will often extend beyond the local community to include individuals about whom little prior knowledge, if any, exists at the provider. This poses challenges for resource protection which do not exist in traditional computing environments. This paper presents a formal framework for secure access to information and services in such systems, where both the size of the user base and a variety of local enterprise-dependent representations of user attributes must be considered. In our framework, an individual supplies digital credentials akin to traditional paper credentials with a request for service. To decide whether to grant the request, the recipient interprets the credentials using knowledge about the credential issuers (more precisely, of what conditions must hold for the issuers to have issued the credentials) rather than, or in addition to, specific knowledge about the requester. Our formalism for access control also provides a basis for security-oriented smart yellow pages facilities, which are directory services that manage queryable registries of information about service providers and their requirements.

Reference-contexts: As discussed in x3, this allows a security policy to be described in terms of a sublanguage (Topics and G) for speaking about structured documents. Further, our YP allows an access policy to be represented as a set P of non-recursive logical rules written in Dat-alog (function-free Horn clauses <ref> [1] </ref>) defining a predi cate CanAccess ( Requester ; ; ) . Atomic formulas of P are credential templates and predicate expressions qualified by a library name, assumed to be that of the library registering P if not explicitly mentioned.

Reference-contexts: The reduction of our ideas to practice requires further research on various issues. For example, styles of authentication which are compatible with our view of authorization (which more directly support nonidentity-based access policies, e.g. <ref> [2] </ref>) may be needed, in addition to already-widely-used authentication protocols, such as PEM [9, 13]. Our view of structured, declarative descriptions of security policies and requirements needs further elaboration, for which techniques from mathematical logic and formal specification may be useful.

On receiving E , R sees that since she is not an XYZ employee, to get VLSI documents she must provide a faculty credential from an XYZ academic affiliate. R may know that the U of I is an affiliate, hence her faculty credential suffices.
