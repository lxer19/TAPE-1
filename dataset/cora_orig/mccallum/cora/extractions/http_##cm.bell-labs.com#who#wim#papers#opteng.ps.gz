Title: Signal Compression with Smooth Local Trigonometric Bases  
Author: Bjorn Jawerth Yi Liu Wim Sweldens 
Keyword: compression, trigonometric bases, wavelets  
Abstract: We discuss smooth local trigonometric bases and their applications to signal compression. In image compression, these bases can reduce the blocking effect that occurs in JPEG. We present and compare two generalizations of the original construction of Malvar, Coifman and Meyer: biorthogonal and equal parity bases. These have the advantage that constant and linear components, respectively, can be represented efficiently. We show how they reduce blocking effects and improve the signal to noise ratio.

Reference-contexts: We can get obtain more localization by splitting the signal into pieces, and perform the Fourier transform on each piece separately. We refer to the corresponding basis as the local trigonometric basis. This is a basic component of JPEG, the standard image compression algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>.

The basis functions are given by e k (x) = exp (i2kx), and we know that the set f I e k j k 2 Ng is an orthogonal basis for L 2 ([0; 1]).

In other words, the blocking effect will be reduced.

These wavelets have an infinite number of vanishing moments, since their Fourier transforms vanish in a neighborhood of the origin. It was shown in <ref> [12] </ref> that more general splittings of the frequency axis correspond to wavelet packets in the spatial domain [19, 20]. 7 5 Biorthogonal local trigonometric bases We say that a basis has a resolution of the constants if, on every interval I, one of the basis functions is constant. <p> This implies that if a large interval is surrounded by two smaller intervals, the epsilons of the large interval have to be small. To overcome this problem we introduce the multiple folding technique developed by Fang and Sere <ref> [12] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Adaptive algorithms are treated in Section 7. Finally, we discuss implementation issues and give some results. Note that this paper does not contain proofs of the mathematical results. For a careful mathematical treatment, we refer to <ref> [13] </ref>. 2 2 Trigonometric bases Fourier series are the classic trigonometric basis. Consider the interval I = [0; 1], for simplicity. <p> Since l n r n is locally even, the integral vanishes. (A function f is locally even (respectively odd) around a point ff if f (x) = M ff f (x) (respectively M ff f (x)) for x 2 [ff *; ff + *].) It is possible to show <ref> [13] </ref> that every element of V n is of the form b n s, where s is locally odd around n and locally even around n + 1, and, conversely, every function of this form belongs to V n . <p> In the remainder we let l ff and r ff = M ff l ff be continuous cutoff functions that do not necessarily satisfy l 2 ff + r 2 ff = 1. We show <ref> [13] </ref> that in case l 2 ff + r 2 ff is bounded from below and above, the folding operator is bounded and invertible. Moreover, the inverse of an invertible folding operator F ff again is a folding operator. <p> One way to accomplish this would be to use folding operators with the same parity left and right of the split point. Unfortunately, such operators are not invertible <ref> [13] </ref>. Basically, this implies that the only way to get the same parity at both endpoints of an interval, is to alternate the parity of the folding operators. <p> We call such a folding operator an equal parity folding operator. It is possible to show <ref> [13] </ref> that these operators are not invertible in L 2 . Nevertheless, they have been used successfully for image compression [5]. We study their behavior in more detail in this section. We shall omit the subscript n for simplicity.

However, this unavoidably results in ill-conditioned discrete operators. Fast algorithms are available for discrete versions of the sine and cosine transforms <ref> [14, 15] </ref>. In the biorthogonal case, one needs the alternate the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and discrete sine transform 14 over the pieces. In the equal parity case, we only need the DCT, which makes the implementation easier.
