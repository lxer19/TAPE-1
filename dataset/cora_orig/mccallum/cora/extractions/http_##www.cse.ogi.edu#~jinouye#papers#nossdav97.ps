Abstract: The emergence of free streaming media players, coupled with the availability of powerful inexpensive laptop computers has created a domain for mobile multimedia applications. Mobile multimedia applications must deal with the inherent variability generated when migrating from office to conference room, den to patio, or classroom to dorm room. This paper presents a multi-layered multimedia architecture utilizing adaptive layers and cross-layer notifications. An implementation of that architecture is demonstrated using a streaming media player that communicates with a video server while switching from wired LAN to POTS to wireless LAN, transparently adapting to new network addresses and bandwidth fluctuations. Mobility is supported by using device indications to force the adaptive feedback system into an "exploratory" mode and signal the application to re-establish the control and data channels.

Reference-contexts: Lack of bandwidth is the major deficiency of wide area wireless technology. Cellular networks provide roughly 9.6 Kbps while Ricochet networks provide approximately 30 Kbps. So while a multimedia application designed for these networks is highly mobile, its content is limited by severe bandwidth constraints. Wireless ATM <ref> [1] </ref> and LAN technology may provide higher bandwidth, but their range is limited to usually a single building. 6.4 Other Problems Caused by Mobility In this paper, we have concentrated on two effects caused by mobility: variations in network addresses and drastic changes in available bandwidth.

Each layer performs the adaptation best suited for it using a methodology of defining quasi-invariants, guarding quasi-invariants, and adapting intelligently when guards trigger. No single layer attempts to hide all the effects of mobility.

Reference-contexts: The solution is based on the basic ideas of cross-layer notification and adaptation.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the architecture of our adaptive multimedia system. Section 3 describes the implementation of the streaming video player and the support added to the operating system. Section 4 evaluates the system by moving it between various heterogeneous networks. <p> It is truly end-to-end, allowing it to also adapt to fluctuations in CPU load and disk traffic.

Reference-contexts: Once the number of consecutive missed beats passes a threshold (default of 2), the next heartbeat is sent to the all-hosts multicast group (224.0.0.1) and the first valid reply becomes the new anchor host. If no valid replies are received from the multicast request, the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) <ref> [14] </ref> is employed to promiscuously listen for all ICMP echo replies. This allows the implementation to distinguish between link-level disconnections (no response at all) and network migrations (responses with incorrect destination MAC addresses). If any response is detected, the network name associated with the device is invalidated.

Reference-contexts: The gateway allows the video server to multicast high quality video without worrying about flooding the low bandwidth network. 6.2 Network-level Gateways Network address transparency is provided by these gateways. Mobile IP <ref> [19] </ref> allows a host to retain its IP address while migrating between different IP networks. Intermediate network-level gateways, called mobile agents, are used to maintain this concept. When away from home, a mobile host is responsible for acquiring a "care-of-address" (COA).

Reference-contexts: For example, a provider can register a condition that channel quality should be greater than 50 (the scale is 1-100, and 100 is the highest quality). If channel quality falls below 50, the provider will receive an indication. 5.3 Routing Policy WinSock-2 <ref> [22] </ref> is the new networking software interface for Windows operating systems and is built into all WindowsNT 4.0 platforms. While Windows95 does not fully support the WinSock-2 architecture, it will probably do so in future releases. The WinSock-2 architecture is a transport-layer application programming interface.

Reference-contexts: The WinSock-2 architecture is a transport-layer application programming interface. Our problem is we want to influ 9 ence network-layer policies related to routing, such as selecting the default route and multicast interface. WinSock-2 encapsulates all routing information and policies within each Service Provider <ref> [23] </ref>. While both Windows95 and WindowsNT provide DOS commands 4 to access the routing table, there is no published API for route table access.

Reference-contexts: This hides both mechanisms and policies within the Service Provider and differs from 4.4BSD where routing policies are implemented in user-level daemons that communicate with the kernel's route table using the routing socket <ref> [24] </ref>. While a single routing policy is not that noticeable when using one interface, it may become an obstacle when multiple interfaces are in use. Windows95 appears to set the default route to the router attached to the NIC inserted last.
