Title: To Send or not to Send: Implementing Deferred Transmissions in a Mobile Host.  
Author: B. R. Badrinath, Pradeep Sudame 
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science Rutgers University  
Abstract: As mobile hosts move, they encounter changing network characteristics. Characteristics such as bandwidth, reliability can change drastically when a mobile host moves from indoor to outdoor environment and vice versa. A mobile host can find itself in a lossy environment due to external conditions such as interference and fading. Existing end-to-end protocols are designed with an assumption that packet loss is a random and rare event. However, due to mobility of hosts, there can be transient yet significant packet loss. In this paper, we consider the effect of mobility on unreliable protocols such as UDP. We provide a mechanism by which unnecessary loss of packets can be avoided by allowing transmission only under good link conditions.

Reference-contexts: We observed that packet loss is quite closely related to the signal quality and the signal strength of the received packets. Also, signal quality is a rough measure of the distance from the base station. For all our experiments, the MSR's are 386/486 PC-AT's running Mach 3.0 micro kernel <ref> [1] </ref> and Unix server (MK84/UX40). The mobile hosts are 486 based laptops. The MH as well as the MSR's use 2 Mbps WaveLAN technology for wireless communication. The MSR's also have a wired interface to 10 Mbps ethernet.

The machines use Columbia mobile-IP protocol as the underlying communication protocol. signal strength is not totally independent of the signal quality. For low signal quality, we never get very high signal strength.

Reference-contexts: Most end-to-end protocols achieve reliability by using acknowledgments and retransmission. We have not used the concept of deferred send in conjunction with reliable protocols such as TCP. This is because TCP timeouts can trigger congestion control mechanisms and link layer transmissions may not improve throughput <ref> [8, 3] </ref>. Another approach is to freeze the timers and round trip delay estimates when the device state is bad. This is rather difficult to do as it may require adjustments even at the remote end.

Reference-contexts: However, the unmodified driver actually sends the packets over the link resulting in more energy consumption. 4. Related work Link layer retransmissions [8, 9] or transmission at higher layers only for the wireless link <ref> [4] </ref> have been suggested to handle lossy wireless links. Most of these efforts suggest aggressive transmission policies to make up for the lost packets. State dependent packet scheduling for handling bursty errors from MSR to MH has been suggested in [5].

Reference-contexts: Most of these efforts suggest aggressive transmission policies to make up for the lost packets. State dependent packet scheduling for handling bursty errors from MSR to MH has been suggested in <ref> [5] </ref>. Our approach is a cautious approach for transmission to reduce packet loss. This may reduce the throughput in some cases, but does save us bandwidth and energy at the mobile hosts. 5.

Reference-contexts: Effects of a lossy link are worse than the effect of a slow link. For example, a slow link might trigger the flow control mechanism of TCP but a lossy link might trigger the congestion control algorithm resulting in reduced throughput <ref> [6] </ref>. 2.2. Problems with the Simple Approach Modifying the packet loss estimate based on only one packet is not a very good idea. When the received signal strength is just above our threshold, we encounter situations where we get a bad packet every once in a while.

Reference-contexts: We observed a high loss with signal strength less than 8. Table 1 classifies the area around the base station in three regions: near region, border region, and far region. the border region, where the packet loss varies from very low to to significant, is very narrow. Studies <ref> [7] </ref> correlating packet loss and distance also indicate that the border region is narrow. These regions are shown in Figure 1. Using these thresholds, we decide our empirical thresholds for deciding loss probability for the packets transmitted. 2.

Reduced retransmissions results in better utilization of limited bandwidth. Bandwidth is very limited for wide area wireless coverage that uses cellular (9.6 Kbps) or CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data) (19.2 Kbps) technology.

Reference-contexts: Hosts connected to the fixed network that communicate directly with the mobile hosts are called mobile support routers (MSR or base stations) as shown in Figure 1. These are special machines which have a wired as well as a wireless interface. A MSR periodically broadcasts a beacon <ref> [11] </ref> to indicate radio coverage. The region around the MSR where a MH can receive this beacon is called as a cell.
