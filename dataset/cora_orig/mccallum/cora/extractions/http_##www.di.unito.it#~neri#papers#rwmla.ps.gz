Abstract: In this paper we define and characterize the process of developing a real-world Machine Learning application, with its difficulties and relevant issues, distinguishing it from the popular practice of exploiting ready-to-use data sets. To this aim, we analyze and summarize the lessons learned from applying Machine Learning techniques to a variety of problems. We believe that these lessons, though primarily based on our personal experience, can be generalized to a wider range of situations and are supported by the reported experiences of other researchers.

Reference-contexts: In fact, ready-to-use data sets do not reflect real life, because the learning task is usually vastly oversimplified, data is of limited size and complexity, difficult cases are often set aside, and knowledge of the domain is mainly ignored <ref> (Asker & Maclin, 1997) </ref>. A satisfactory behaviour of a learning algorithm on some ready-to-use data set is not a sufficient support for claiming its scalability to the real-world. Of course, this scalability is not excluded: simply, it should not be taken for granted.

Reference-contexts: the opportunity to work on applications in different fields (using both learning approaches and, earlier, non-learning, classical AI methods) such as industrial troubleshooting (Giordana et al., 1993; Botta et al., 1991), molecular biology (Calapaj, Lo Bello & Saitta, 1997), medicine (Belforte et al., 1985; Milanese et al., 1982), industrial robotics <ref> (Baroglio et al., 1996) </ref>, speech recognition (Bergadano, Giordana & Saitta, 1988; Faure, Frediani & Saitta, 1993; Gemello & Saitta, 1987), cognitive psychology (Neri, Saitta & Tiberghien, 1997) and knowledge discovery in large databases (Botta et al., 1997).

Methods of Information in Medicine, </title> <type> 24 , 3945. </type>
Reference-contexts: Finally, the system QUANTIF, which performs knowledge base restructuring by introducing M-of-N rules (Frediani & Saitta, 1986; Faure, Frediani & Saitta, 1993), was developed in response to the need for this kind of representation in medical applications <ref> (Belforte et al., 1985) </ref>. 5.2. Industrial Troubleshooting Application The first large application we faced was to learn a diagnostic knowledge base for mechanical troubleshooting . In this application, which is a clear instance of the collaborative type, the systems ML-SMART, ENIGMA and WHY were employed.

Reference-contexts: Our initial research in Machine Learning addressed the problem of learning classification rules expressed in First-Order Logic. Examples could be described by both categorical and numerical attributes and the presence of noise was explicitly taken into consideration <ref> (Bergadano, Giordana & Saitta, 1988) </ref>. The first system, ML-SMART, was an inductive learner. It adopted a topdown search strategy, acquired chained rules (not just a flat knowledge base) and performed discretization of continuous-valued attributes by means of fuzzy linguistic variables.

Reference-contexts: The learned knowledge base has been used for five years by the company, both in the field and for training purposes. The parallel, manual development of an expert system devoted to the same task allowed the manual and the automatic generation of knowledge to be compared <ref> (Bergadano, Giordana & Saitta, 1990) </ref>. At the ENICHEM chemical plant a mechanism was in place for performing predictive maintenance. All the electromechanical apparata undergo periodic predictive tests. The predictive maintenance process has two phases: a routine inspection and the Mechanalysis.

Reference-contexts: This need drove us to add to ML-SMART an EBL-like capability, which provided justification for the learned rules. This new version of ML-SMART was the system ENIGMA <ref> (Bergadano, Giordana & Saitta, 1991) </ref>. Prompted again by experts, we sought to provide a qualitative causal explanation for the learned rules. This research line resulted in the WHY system (Baroglio, Botta & Saitta, 1994; Saitta, 16 L.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, for several applications it is important to be able to handle continuous numerical attributes while retaining a symbolic representation language. So ENIGMA evolved into SMART+ <ref> (Botta & Giordana, 1993) </ref>, which has both locally optimized interval discretization and global optimization (by genetic search) of the numerical parameters occurring in rules. Furthermore, the industrial robotics application described by Baroglio et al. (1996) suggested to us forming a hybrid of the symbolic approach with the connectionist one.

Reference-contexts: (Calapaj, Lo Bello & Saitta, 1997), medicine (Belforte et al., 1985; Milanese et al., 1982), industrial robotics (Baroglio et al., 1996), speech recognition (Bergadano, Giordana & Saitta, 1988; Faure, Frediani & Saitta, 1993; Gemello & Saitta, 1987), cognitive psychology (Neri, Saitta & Tiberghien, 1997) and knowledge discovery in large databases <ref> (Botta et al., 1997) </ref>. Thus we have had the chance to interact with both domain experts and end-users who displayed different attitudes and different degrees of trust and understanding of the potential of the methodologies we were proposing. <p> Furthermore, the industrial robotics application described by Baroglio et al. (1996) suggested to us forming a hybrid of the symbolic approach with the connectionist one. This hybridization led to the implementation of the system FONN <ref> (Botta, Giordana & Piola, 1997) </ref>. As ML-SMART evolved into ENIGMA and then into WHY, it has become increasingly knowledge-intensive. Effective learning is achieved by exploiting large bodies of domain knowledge and more sophisticated reasoning tools.

Reference-contexts: Actually, the user himself typically performs the whole process (possibly helped by a domain expert). This is the case when using off-the-shelf systems such as CART <ref> (Breiman et al., 1984) </ref>, C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) or one of the several Siftware tools for KDD available to potential users 2 . The trigger of the learning process is still a problem that the user has to solve. <p> However, this region still does not contain real-world ML applications because no one is using the learned knowledge. The center-top region contains successful ML applications performed by the user him/herself. These applications are real-world ones according to our definition. This region contains applications performed using systems like CART <ref> (Breiman et al., 1984) </ref>, C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) or MineSet (Brunk, Kelly & Kohavi, 1997) to solve specific users problems. The right-center region contains those ML applications that are characterized by an active involvement of the user, the expert and the ML developer to solve some problem.

Reference-contexts: On the contrary, an explanation of As better behavior would shed light on the difficult question of relating classes of problems and wellsuited types of algorithms <ref> (Brodley & Smyth, 1995) </ref>. To this aim, standard benchmarks, precisely defined and correctly used, are fundamental.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, a friendly user interface and effective tools for data visualization are important, as noted by Schwabacher, Hirsh and Ellman (1995). In fact, ML systems that are designed with this type of application process in mind typically have impressive interfaces, as in the case of MineSet <ref> (Brunk, Kelly, & Kohavi, 1997) </ref>, MultiSpec (Landgrebe & Biehl, 1994) or Clementine 3 . <p> In this region, the evaluation of the results is provided only by the ML researcher. Work in this region might be a preliminary step in the development of methodologies scaleable later to real-world problems. Examples of this evolution are C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) and MineSet <ref> (Brunk, Kelly & Kohavi, 1997) </ref>. The opposite may also happen: data used in a real application are made available to other researchers through some data set collection. However, the data looses most of its real-worldliness in the transfer. <p> The center-top region contains successful ML applications performed by the user him/herself. These applications are real-world ones according to our definition. This region contains applications performed using systems like CART (Breiman et al., 1984), C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) or MineSet <ref> (Brunk, Kelly & Kohavi, 1997) </ref> to solve specific users problems. The right-center region contains those ML applications that are characterized by an active involvement of the user, the expert and the ML developer to solve some problem.

Reference-contexts: This situation is not peculiar to ML; it applies in general to the process of technology transfer , as Isaacs and Tang (1996) note, especially when the source of transfer is academic research <ref> (Foley, 1996) </ref>. It is difficult for new technologies to be accepted, particularly in fields where well-assessed, although limited, classical software development methods exist.

Reference-contexts: Between the two extreme scenarios described in Figures 1 and 2, a wide spectrum of intermediate situations may occur <ref> (Garner et al., 1995) </ref>. For instance, most of the schemes proposed for KDD (see, for example, Fayyad, PiatetskyShapiro and Smyth (1996)) envision an interaction between the user and the ML developer, but not as close as the one required by the collaborative scheme. 4.

Reference-contexts: In fact, Fayyad (1996) states that Knowledge discovery in databases is the nontrivial process of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns in data. According to Craven and Shavlik (1995), comprehensibility is useful for knowledge validation (an expert wants to inspect rules to be confident in them <ref> (Giboin, 1995) </ref>), for discovery (knowledge has to be analyzed by human experts (Hunter & Klein, 1993)), for suggestions of better features and for knowledge refinement. Recently, Kohavi and Kuntz (1997) have advocated better comprehensibility as a motivation for proposing Option Decision Trees.

As ML-SMART evolved into ENIGMA and then into WHY, it has become increasingly knowledge-intensive. Effective learning is achieved by exploiting large bodies of domain knowledge and more sophisticated reasoning tools.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, for several applications it is important to be able to handle continuous numerical attributes while retaining a symbolic representation language. So ENIGMA evolved into SMART+ <ref> (Botta & Giordana, 1993) </ref>, which has both locally optimized interval discretization and global optimization (by genetic search) of the numerical parameters occurring in rules. Furthermore, the industrial robotics application described by Baroglio et al. (1996) suggested to us forming a hybrid of the symbolic approach with the connectionist one.

Reference-contexts: According to Craven and Shavlik (1995), comprehensibility is useful for knowledge validation (an expert wants to inspect rules to be confident in them (Giboin, 1995)), for discovery (knowledge has to be analyzed by human experts <ref> (Hunter & Klein, 1993) </ref>), for suggestions of better features and for knowledge refinement. Recently, Kohavi and Kuntz (1997) have advocated better comprehensibility as a motivation for proposing Option Decision Trees. Unfortunately, we do not have a principled mechanism for measuring comprehensibility.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, a friendly user interface and effective tools for data visualization are important, as noted by Schwabacher, Hirsh and Ellman (1995). In fact, ML systems that are designed with this type of application process in mind typically have impressive interfaces, as in the case of MineSet <ref> (Brunk, Kelly, & Kohavi, 1997) </ref>, MultiSpec (Landgrebe & Biehl, 1994) or Clementine 3 . <p> In this region, the evaluation of the results is provided only by the ML researcher.

The right-center region contains those ML applications that are characterized by an active involvement of the user, the expert and the ML developer to solve some problem.

Note that the development of interfaces and the engineering phase disappeared from the cycle shown on Figure 2 because this activity becomes an integral part of the ML developer's job, who aims at creating a ready-to-use, appealing product.

Reference-contexts: As already mentioned, in complex applications a lot of time is spent in developing accessory modules, such as user-friendly interfaces <ref> (Langley & Simon, 1995) </ref>, or links to existing software or hardware (van Someren, 1994). For researchers, it may not be rewarding to devote time to produce software as a product.

Reference-contexts: The center-center region contains those ML applications where a user carefully evaluates alternative ML tools, usually with the aim of exploring their potential. Evaluating the results may require a big effort in terms of both costs and human resources. Research work such as that reported in the StatLog project <ref> (Michie, Spiegelhalter & Taylor, 1994) </ref> mainly belongs to this region 6 . The real worldliness level of these applications is higher than the ones of all the previously discussed regions. However, this region still does not contain real-world ML applications because no one is using the learned knowledge.
