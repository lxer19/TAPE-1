Title: THE PROGRAMMING OF A TELEMANIPULATOR WITH THE FORCE-CUBE

Abstract: While programming a telemanipulator the operator often uses special input devices to generate trajectories, which are to difficult for automatic planers. Though the trajectories are evaluated by a simulation and shown on a graphical animation, it is much faster to give the operator direct haptic feedback if a collision will occur while executing the trajectory. To combine the haptic feedback with an intuitive input device, we have developed the ForceCube. The input parameters are separated in three translational and three rotational values. They are matched on three orthogonal sides of a cube in such way, that their axes correspond to their counterparts in the real word. Each of the axes can be blocked in one direction. With this feature it is possible to move the manipulator with contact in one direction and without any constraints in the other directions. The ForceCube is integrated in the teleoperation system TelOS developed at the Institute for Real-Time Computing and Robotics.

Reference-contexts: Since all telepresence systems provide a visual feedback for the operator either a graphical animation of the results of the simulation or a video image of cameras from the testbed <ref> (Bejczy 1990) </ref>, (Hirzinger et al. 1991) another form of feedback must be used for the input device. As it is shown in (Seipp 1995) the fastest feedback is the haptic one.

Reference-contexts: Aspects like human safety, resource efficiency, limited and cost intensive crew availability calls for new operation concepts, where "intelligent" sensor controlled telemanipulators have to fulfill complex tasks in supervisory control mode, once autonomous systems are not able to perform the processes reliable enough <ref> (Foth et al. 1992) </ref>. Autonomy becomes very costly in situations where the environment is too complex and therefore significant sensing and control errors exist (Paul, Funda 1991).

Reference-contexts: Autonomy becomes very costly in situations where the environment is too complex and therefore significant sensing and control errors exist <ref> (Paul, Funda 1991) </ref>. Therefore, to build reliable and flexible systems for teleoperation consequently an operator has to be placed into the control loop especially in situations, where the flexibility and cognitive capabilities of a human are necessary to support the telemanipulator system.

Reference-contexts: According to the above mentioned requirements we have developed the ForceCube, which is an intuitive, six dimensional input device with selective haptic feedback in each direction of its six degrees of freedom. The following sections give an short overview of the teleoperation system TelOS <ref> (Schaude 1995) </ref>, in which the ForceCube is integrated. After describing the ForceCube itself, we show its usage and give a review over the progress we achieved using the ForceCube. The paper is finished with the conclusion.

Reference-contexts: As it is shown in <ref> (Seipp 1995) </ref> the fastest feedback is the haptic one. This device should be correspond for six degrees of freedom to the cobots with two and three degrees of freedom described in (Wannasuphoprasit et al. 1997). <p> These results have shown that the haptic feedback leads to a much faster reaction by the user than the visual feedback. Whereas the reaction time of a graphical animation is between 20 and 100 milliseconds, the haptic feedback cycle is between 5 and 20 milliseconds <ref> (Seipp 1995) </ref>. With the ForceCube we have enhanced the velocity of the TelOS system to move objects, which have contact constraints. By this way it is even possible to insert force guided a screw or follow the way through a labyrinth even blind.

This device should be correspond for six degrees of freedom to the cobots with two and three degrees of freedom described in <ref> (Wannasuphoprasit et al. 1997) </ref>. Because there are many situations in which the manipulator can not move or turn in one direction but in all others, this input device should correspond to this feature in giving a haptic feedback even only in one direction.
