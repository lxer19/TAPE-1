Abstract: We consider a flow control mechanism that dynamically regulates the rate of data flow into a network based on feedback information about the network state. Such mechanisms have been introduced recently in a variety of networks including the Internet, and have been advocated for future high-speed networks. We first model the flow control mechanism by a discrete-space stochastic process and define appropriate performance measures for transient and steady-state regimes. However, the model does not appear to be analytically tractable and we study it through simulation. We then simplify it to a continuous-space deterministic (or fluid) model for which we can easily derive closed-form solutions. We find the analytical results for the fluid model to agree well with the simulation results obtained using the discrete-space model. Both models explicitly consider delay of the feedback information, thus making them relevant for high-speed networks.

Reference-contexts: For performance evaluation, it is natural to model a flow control mechanism by a queueing system. Much is known about the steady-state behavior of queueing systems, when the service and job arrival rates are stationary (i.e., have distributions that do not change with time) and certain product-form conditions hold <ref> [1, 20] </ref>. These results have been used extensively to study fixed-window flow control mechanisms in loss-less networks [30, 33]. However, to model flow control mechanisms that dynamically regulate the source rate based on feedback information, we need queueing models where the service times and job arrivals are time-varying and state-dependent.

Reference-contexts: We compare the analytical results for the fluid model with the simulation results obtained using the discrete-space model, and find them to correspond closely. A preliminary version of the fluid model was presented in <ref> [2] </ref>. Section 4 concludes the paper. 2 A Discrete-space Stochastic Model In this section, we present a discrete-space stochastic model of a connection with rate-based flow control. Each data packet sent by the source has a congestion bit initially equal to 0.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the analysis of such systems is extremely difficult and it has received limited attention. Only a few special cases have been solved [35]. More complex systems are often analyzed by numerically solving the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations describing the system state <ref> [36, 3] </ref>, but this rapidly becomes unmanageable for realistic models. These difficulties led to the development of approximate techniques.

Reference-contexts: We explicitly model the bottleneck node by a queue of service rate bits/s. Let Q (t) denote the queue size at time t. We do not explicitly model the non bottleneck nodes. It has been shown that this does not introduce significant errors <ref> [29, 4] </ref>. We use a constant delay D F to represent the queueing and propagation delays from the source to the bottleneck, and another constant delay D R to represent the queueing and propagation delays from the bottleneck back to the source (see Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: These difficulties led to the development of approximate techniques. One such technique is the fluid approximation, where the basic idea is to replace discrete-space stochastic processes by corresponding continuous-space deterministic processes, which are related by means of ordinary differential equations <ref> [27, 20, 5] </ref>. An extension of this is the diffusion approximation [20, 26]. Another technique is the 1 Otherwise a packet can be retransmitted while its previous copy is still in transit. state approach technique [34].

Reference-contexts: We are extending our model to consider the effects of such averaging techniques in the feedback mechanism. In this paper, we analyzed the performance of a single connection with rate-based flow control. Fluid approximations have been found convenient for studying the time-dependent behavior of networks with more general topologies <ref> [6] </ref>. We are extending our model to consider multiple connections sharing one or more bottleneck nodes. Preliminary results indicate that the source sending rates and the bottleneck queue sizes follow a rich panoply of dynamical behaviors, with variations depending on round trip delays and rate control schemes.

The window size is intended to be a bound on the number of data and acknowledgement packets of this connection in transit in the network.

Reference-contexts: These difficulties led to the development of approximate techniques. One such technique is the fluid approximation, where the basic idea is to replace discrete-space stochastic processes by corresponding continuous-space deterministic processes, which are related by means of ordinary differential equations <ref> [27, 20, 5] </ref>. An extension of this is the diffusion approximation [20, 26].

Reference-contexts: These mechanisms attempt to adapt the source rate to the bottleneck rate in minimum time and with minimum packet delay or loss. A variety of feedback schemes are possible. In the binary feedback scheme, which is used in DECNET <ref> [28] </ref> and is being advocated for ISO TP4 [23] and high-speed networks [38], each data packet received by the destination has a bit indicating whether or not the packet encountered an intermediate node with average queue size greater than 1; this information is sent back to the source in acknowledgement packets. <p> Ke-shav [19] describes a scheme in which the source adjusts its rate to keep the bottleneck queue size around some fixed value. Other rate-based schemes have been proposed in [8, 39, 10, 18, 31, 37, 13, 38]. However, most protocols currently in operation <ref> [33, 28, 15] </ref> use a window-based scheme, rather than the rate-based scheme. Here, a limit referred to as the window size is placed on the number of packets that can be outstanding at the source, but no constraint is placed on the rate at which these packets can be sent. <p> Another technique is the 1 Otherwise a packet can be retransmitted while its previous copy is still in transit. state approach technique [34]. Finally, it should be pointed out that due to the lack of analytical results, a number of flow control mechanisms have been evaluated with discrete-event simulation <ref> [28, 39, 11] </ref> or experimental approaches [15, 22, 32]. Summary of the rest of the paper In this paper, we consider a rate-based flow control mechanism with feedback similar to that of the binary feedback scheme. <p> Recall that = 120 kbit/s for the ordinary network, and = 40 Mbit/s for the high-speed network. Therefore, a tradeoff has to be found between a rapid relaxation to steady-state and the efficiency of the steady-state regime. This is consistent with the results reported in <ref> [28, 25] </ref>. bottleneck queue size, for the ordinary network when ^ fi = 2 and ^ fi = 8. <p> It also shows that it is important to take the current roundtrip delay into account when adjusting the sending rate at the source. This is consistent with the results reported in the literature <ref> [28, 23, 25, 26, 38, 19] </ref>. In our model, rate adjustments are made based on feedback information that reflects an instantaneous value of the bottleneck queue size.

Reference-contexts: We explicitly model the bottleneck node by a queue of service rate bits/s. Let Q (t) denote the queue size at time t. We do not explicitly model the non bottleneck nodes. It has been shown that this does not introduce significant errors <ref> [29, 4] </ref>. We use a constant delay D F to represent the queueing and propagation delays from the source to the bottleneck, and another constant delay D R to represent the queueing and propagation delays from the bottleneck back to the source (see Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: Recently, flow control mechanisms have been proposed where the source rate is dynamically regulated based on feedback from the intermediate nodes <ref> [9, 15, 37, 18, 25, 31, 13, 38, 19] </ref>. These mechanisms attempt to adapt the source rate to the bottleneck rate in minimum time and with minimum packet delay or loss. A variety of feedback schemes are possible. <p> In the Internet TCP, the source measures the times between sending a packet and receiving its acknowledgement and uses them to maintain a running roundtrip time estimate [15]. Other schemes rely on feedback information that includes average link utilization <ref> [10, 31] </ref>, inter-arrival times between successive acknowledgement packets [18], etc. There is also a variety of ways to regulate the source rate based on the feedback information. In rate-based mechanisms, the source rate is regulated by adjusting inter-packet gaps. <p> Ke-shav [19] describes a scheme in which the source adjusts its rate to keep the bottleneck queue size around some fixed value. Other rate-based schemes have been proposed in <ref> [8, 39, 10, 18, 31, 37, 13, 38] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Note that because packets can be lost, a good roundtrip time estimate is an essential part of window-based schemes. 1 Obtaining a good roundtrip time estimate in a network when losses are frequent is not trivial <ref> [16, 15, 32] </ref>, and maybe as difficult as the original flow control problem. Performance evaluation of flow control schemes We are interested in evaluating the performance of dynamic flow control mechanisms. Performance measures of interest to the user include the average throughput and response time. <p> Finally, it should be pointed out that due to the lack of analytical results, a number of flow control mechanisms have been evaluated with discrete-event simulation [28, 39, 11] or experimental approaches <ref> [15, 22, 32] </ref>. Summary of the rest of the paper In this paper, we consider a rate-based flow control mechanism with feedback similar to that of the binary feedback scheme. In Section 2, we present a queueing model that explicitly represents the delay in the feedback. <p> The first setting characterizes an `ordinary' network, i.e., a network similar to networks currently in operation, and is as follows: = 120 kbit/s, D F = D R = 330 ms. These values are consistent with measures obtained experimentally from Internet connections spanning the continental United States <ref> [32] </ref>.
