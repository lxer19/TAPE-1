Abstract: To accelerate the design cycle for analog and mixed-signal systems, we have proposed a top-down,constraint-driven design methodology. The key idea of the proposed methodology is hierarchically propagating constraints from performance specifications to layout. Consequently, it is essential to provide the necessary tools and techniques enabling the efficient constraint propagation. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed methodology to the design of larger systems, we present in this paper the complete design flow for a video driver system. Critical advantages of the methodology illustrated with this design example include avoiding costly low level re-designs and getting working silicon parts from the first run. Following our approach, a jitter constraint is imposed at the system level and then is propagated hierarchically to the circuit blocks and layout, using behavioral modeling and simulation. Experimental results are presented from working fabricated parts.

Reference-contexts: To facilitate the design of analog and mixed analog-digital circuits, we have proposed a Top-Down, Constraint-Driven Design Methodology <ref> [1] </ref>. The key idea of the methodology is the hierarchical propagation of constraints based on behavioral modeling and optimization. At each level of the design hierarchy, performance constraints are mapped onto constraints on the parameters characterizing the blocks of the subsequent level of the hierarchy. <p> The overall jitter is then predicted by adding random noise at the time of each VCO transition and subsequently processing the resulting waveform [3]. PLL High-Level Optimization Since the behavioral description does not depend on the low-level implementation, we choose the high-level parameters by optimizing for maximum design flexibility <ref> [1] </ref>. Flexibility is a heuristic measure of the easiness to meet a set of design specifications. Typically, parabolic and hyperbolic functions are used. The flexibility function for parameter Dt V CO rms is shown in Figure 4.
