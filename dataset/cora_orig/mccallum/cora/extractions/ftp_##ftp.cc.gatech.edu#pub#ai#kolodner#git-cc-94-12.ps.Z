Abstract: Dissatisfaction with existing standard case-based reasoning (CBR) systems has prompted us to investigate how we can make these systems more creative and, more broadly, what would it mean for them to be more creative. This paper discusses three research goals: understanding creative processes better, investigating the role of cases and CBR in creative problem solving, and understanding the framework that supports this more interesting kind of case-based reasoning. In addition, it discusses methodological issues in the study of creativity and, in particular, the use of CBR as a research paradigm for exploring creativity.

Reference-contexts: But few people see case-based reasoning as a research paradigm for addressing new problems, as providing tools for investigation that go beyond what other research paradigms can provide. Maggie Boden <ref> [1] </ref> wrote a wonderful book about creativity, which I heartily recommend. She shows far better than I do how creativity emerges from the complex interactions of processes.

Reference-contexts: the role of cases and case-based reasoning processes in this kind of interesting problem solving; 3. to find out more about the framework that supports this more interesting kind of case-based reasoning. 2 Standard Case-Based Reasoning and Creative Problem Solving: Similarities and Differences The standard CBR framework has several parts <ref> [2] </ref>. First comes situation assessment, the process of understanding a situation well enough to begin to solve a problem. In most of our problem solving CBR programs, we forget about this step completely, assuming that the representation we have is sufficient for solving a problem. <p> and second, what we now know about creativity. 4 The role of cases and CBR in creative problem solving 4.1 Roles Cases Play We already know that cases play a major role in generating ideas that are re-used directly, adapted to the current situation, or merged with other design pieces <ref> [2] </ref>. For example, in our excerpt, tennis balls (7) and softballs (16) are recalled to be reused for the new purpose of protecting eggs. We also know that cases are useful in predicting outcomes of proposed solutions. <p> We already knew from previous CBR work that cases should contain symbolic physical and causal descriptions of a problem, its solution or response, and the outcome of the solution <ref> [2] </ref>. For example, design cases should encode symbolic descriptions of a device's common functions and behaviors, its structural composition, causal descriptions of how it works, and the results of its operations, how it fails, and its pros and cons.

Reference-contexts: specifications and discovering and adding in additional ones that seemed relevant. 4 1.2 Creative JULIA our earliest computer model of creative problem solving Based on the analysis above and observations and analysis of several other people solving simple problems, one of my students built a computer program called Creative JULIA <ref> [3] </ref> that exhibited the reasoning outlined above. Creative JULIA focused on three major processes: memory search and retrieval, evaluation of alternatives, and updating a problem specification. Its task was another meal planning task to come up with a dish that satisfied a given specification.

Reference-contexts: Finally, some questions are outcome-related. Previous design cases can be used to project or derive the outcome of the current one. This new study gave us a better understanding of the ways in which these issues are incrementally raised or "revealed" as the evaluation proceeds. Navinchandra <ref> [6] </ref> calls this criteria emergence and shows an example of how it can arise from case-based projection. In addition to criteria or evaluative issues, constraints [7], preferences, and relative priorities among them also gradually emerge.

Reference-contexts: Navinchandra [6] calls this criteria emergence and shows an example of how it can arise from case-based projection. In addition to criteria or evaluative issues, constraints <ref> [7] </ref>, preferences, and relative priorities among them also gradually emerge. This type of evaluation is a key driving force within creative design, feeding back to situation assessment as well as guiding case manipulation.

JULIANA, like any standard case-based program of its time, solved problems by remembering an old case and adapting it to fit the new situation. One of JULIANA's solutions got me thinking about creativity in a way I hadn't thought about it up to then.

Reference-contexts: Sequential composition of the basic CBR processes seems far too restrictive. Rather, these processes seem to be highly intertwined and to interact in interesting ways <ref> [9] </ref>. For example, problem elaboration and redescription tactics specify contexts for search that retrieval processes use, while evaluation of recalled or adapted alternatives feeds information back to these situation assessment tactics, resulting in even better contexts for search.

Reference-contexts: One can think about those specifications providing a "lens" for looking at the rest of the world. The "lens" provides preferences on the kinds of things we retrieve, and it provides a way of viewing things we see <ref> [10] </ref>. For example, our team of ME designers were considering using a spring launching device and went to a home improvement store to look into materials. While comparing the strengths of several springs by compressing them, they noticed that the springs tended to bend.
