Abstract: Despite recent improvements in analytic techniques for attacking the Data Encryption Standard (DES), exhaustive key search remains the most practical and efficient attack. Key search is becoming alarmingly practical. We show how to build an exhaustive DES key search machine for $1 million that can find a key in 3.5 hours on average. The design for such a machine is described in detail for the purpose of assessing the resistance of DES to an exhaustive attack. This design is based on mature technology to avoid making guesses about future capabilities. With this approach, DES keys can be found one to two orders of magnitude faster than other recently proposed designs. The basic machine design can be adapted to attack the standard DES modes of operation for a small penalty in running time. The issues of development cost and machine reliability are examined as well. In light of this work, it would be prudent in many applications to use DES in a triple-encryption mode.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction From the time that details of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) <ref> [4] </ref> were made available, there has been a great deal of controversy surrounding its short 56-bit keys. <p> For standard cells, names are not bolded and there are no arrows on input lines. Throughout the design, standard bit numbering is used with 0 as the least signif icant (rightmost) bit. This differs from the DES description <ref> [4] </ref> where the numbering of a 64-bit quantity begins with 1 for the most significant bit up to 64 for the least significant bit. Sufficient buffering was included in the chip design to limit the fanout of all gates to at most 8. <p> The write-only registers include the 64-bit plaintext register , the 64-bit ciphertext register , and the 56-bit key counter register. There is also the read-only 56-bit output_key register . Note that in this design, key parity bits as defined in DES <ref> [4] </ref> are not included. The microprocessor can also read and write the stop bit which indicates the state of the chip. A total of 27 pins are used. Five pins are allocated to each of power and ground.

Reference-contexts: There is no need to do testing during key searches. 5 8. Modes of DES Thus far we have concentrated on attacking DES when it is used in the electronic codebook (ECB) mode. However, there are other standard modes of DES <ref> [5] </ref>. All of the 64-bit modes can be attacked using the same machine design (this is demonstrated below). T o support modes which produce less than 64 bits of ciphertext at a time requires modif ications to the chip design.

Reference-contexts: One of the f irst criticisms came from Diffie and Hellman who argued that it was feasible to build a machine that could attack DES by exhaustively searching through all 2 56 DES keys, and that the cost of building this machine would decrease rapidly with time <ref> [6] </ref>. Since then, several attempts have been made to assess the cost and time required for exhaustive key search [7, 8, 10, 15]. In recent years, analytic techniques have been found to attack DES.

Matsuis linear cryptanalysis can find DES keys given 2 47 known plaintexts [12]. <p> However , using the design in this paper, this task would take only 3.5 hours using today s technology. This is 60 times faster than the 1995 estimate and 12 times faster than the year 2000 estimate. At Crypto 92, Eberle <ref> [7] </ref> described a 1 Gbit/s gallium-arsenide (GaAs) DES chip. This chip costs $300. Using $1 million worth of these chips, it would take 8 days to search through half of the key space. This is 55 times slower than the design in this paper.

Reference-contexts: The reason for making the middle operation a decryption is for compatibility with single-DES. If all keys are made equal, then triple-DES collapses to single-DES. The two-key version of tripleDES was estimated to be 10 13 times stronger than singleDES by van Oorschot and Wiener <ref> [14] </ref>. The three-key version is even stronger . In cases where security must be improved for a lar ge installed base of equipment using DES, it is likely to be much less costly to switch to triple-DES than it is to switch to a different cryptosystem.

Matsuis linear cryptanalysis can find DES keys given 2 47 known plaintexts [12]. <p> This difference is mainly due to the difference in chip cost and the use of pipelining. Using Eberles chip has the advantage of not having to do a chip design, but the gain from designing a new chip is considerable. During the rump session of Crypto 92, Wayner <ref> [15] </ref> proposed the idea of searching the DES key space using a content-addressable search engine. This approach has the advantage that it works on a general-purpose machine.
