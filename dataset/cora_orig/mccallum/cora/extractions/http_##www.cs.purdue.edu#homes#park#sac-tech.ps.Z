Abstract: Analytical and empirical studies have shown that self-similar network traffic can have a detrimental impact on network performance including amplified queueing delay and packet loss rate. Given the ubiquity of scale-invariant burstiness observed across diverse networking contexts, finding effective traffic control algorithms capable of detecting and managing self-similar traffic has become an important problem. In this paper, we study congestion control algorithms for improving throughput under self-similar traffic conditions. Although scale-invariant burstiness imposes a limit on the ability to conjointly achieve high quality of service (QoS) and utilization, the long-range dependence associated with self-similar traffic leaves open the possibility that the correlation structure may be exploited for performance enhancement purposes. We use a form of predictive congestion control called Selective Aggressiveness Control (SAC) to show that long-range dependence can be on-line detected and exploited to improve throughput. We show that the correlation structure present in long-range dependent traffic can be used to predict future traffic levels over time scales that are relevant to feedback congestion control. This on-line detected correlation structure is then used to drive a variable aggressiveness control which throttles the data rate upward if the future contention level is predicted to be low, being more aggressive the lower the predicted contention level. The predictive congestion control module runs on top of a generic rate-based linear increase/exponential decrease feedback control and is easily portable to other contexts. We show that a significant improvement in throughput can be obtained if SAC is active and we show that the relative performance improvement increases as long-range dependence is increased. Lastly, we show that as the number of connections engaging in SAC increases both fairness and efficiency are preserved.

Reference-contexts: This, in turn, can be attributed to the fact that we are computing statistics for a long-range dependent process, and it is well-known that for such processes a very large number of samples is needed to compute even its first-order statistics accurately. A related discussion can be found in <ref> [9] </ref>. The fact that this volatility stems from too few sample points also delimits the impact of this phenomenon.

Reference-contexts: From a queueing theory perspective, the principal distinguishing characteristic of long-range dependent traffic is that the queue length distribution decays much more slowly|i.e., polynomially|vis-a-vis short-range-dependent traffic sources such as Poisson sources which exhibit exponential decay. A number of performance studies <ref> [1, 2, 11, 29, 32, 34] </ref> have shown that self-similarity has a detrimental effect on network performance leading to increased delay and packet loss rate. In [18, 37], the point is advanced that for small buffer sizes or short time scales, long-range dependence has only a marginal impact.

Reference-contexts: Since scale-invariant burstiness can exert a significant impact on network performance, understanding the causes and effects of traffic self-similarity is an important problem. In previous work <ref> [33, 34] </ref>, we have investigated the causal and performance aspect of traffic self-similarity, and we have shown that self-similar traffic flow is an intrinsic property of networked client/server systems with heavy-tailed file size distributions and conjoint provision of low delay and high throughput is adversely affected by scale-invariant burstiness. <p> Thus, as ff decreases, a large portion of the probability mass is located in the tail of the distribution. In practical terms, a random variable that follows a heavy-tailed distribution can take on extremely large values with nonnegligible probability. 2.2 Structural Causality In <ref> [33] </ref>, we show that aggregate traffic self-similarity is an intrinsic property of networked client/server systems where the size of the objects (e.g., files) being accessed is heavy-tailed. <p> We call this relationship between the traffic pattern observed at the network layer and the structural property of a distributed, networked system in terms of its high-level object sizes structural causality <ref> [33] </ref>. <p> Eight levels were found to be sufficiently granular for prediction purposes. 5 3.2 Estimation of Conditional Probability Density To explore and quantify the potential predictability of self-similar network traffic, we use TCP traffic traces collected in <ref> [33] </ref> whose Hurst parameter estimates are shown in Figure 2.1 as the main reference point. First, we use off-line estimation of aggregate throughput traffic which is then refined to online estimation of aggregate traffic using per-connection traffic when performing predictive congestion control. <p> We follow a different approach based on the notion of structural causality (see Section 2.2) whereby we make use of the fact that in a networked client/server environment with clients interactively accessing files or objects with heavy-tailed sizes from servers across the network leads to aggregate traffic that is self-similar <ref> [33] </ref>. Most importantly, this mechanism is robust and holds when the file transfers are mediated by transport layer protocols executing reliable flow-controlled transport (e.g., TCP) or unreliable flow-controlled transport. <p> In a typical configuration, the first 32 connections served as "background traffic" transferring files from clients to servers (or sinks) where the file sizes were drawn from Pareto distributions with shape parameter ff = 1:05; 1:35; 1:65; 1:95. As in <ref> [33] </ref>, there was a linear relation between ff and the long-range dependence of aggregate traffic observed at the bottleneck link (G 1 ; G 2 ) as captured by the Hurst parameter H.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recent measurements of local-area and wide-area traffic <ref> [8, 28, 42] </ref> have shown that network traffic exhibits variability at a wide range of scales. What is striking is the ubiquitousness of the phenomenon which has been observed in diverse networking contexts, from Ethernet to ATM, LAN and WAN, compressed video, and HTTP-based WWW traffic [8, 15, 23, 42]. <p> What is striking is the ubiquitousness of the phenomenon which has been observed in diverse networking contexts, from Ethernet to ATM, LAN and WAN, compressed video, and HTTP-based WWW traffic <ref> [8, 15, 23, 42] </ref>. Such scale-invariant variability is in strong contrast to traditional models of network traffic which show burstiness at short time scales but are essentially smooth at large time scales; i.e., they lack long-range dependence.
