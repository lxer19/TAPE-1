Abstract: x-Sim is a network simulator based on the x-kernel. It provides a complete and realistic framework for developing, analyzing, and testing network protocols. This document is intended to be used as a reference to x-sim by those already familiar with the x-kernel.

Reference-contexts: Two hosts, "1" and "2", are configured on each Ethernet, for a total of four hosts. When the simulator is executed, a 1MB file is transferred between the hosts named "1"; the hosts named "2" conduct random tcplib transfers to provide the background traffic <ref> [CDJM91] </ref>. Figure 3 shows a picture of our example internet.

Reference-contexts: These queues are of limited size, and packets routed to an output port while its queue is full or if the RED algorithm decides packets are dropped by the router. For more information on the RED algorithm see <ref> [FJ93] </ref>. The following arguments can be used with the router.

Reference-contexts: to implement other types of networks and routers for inclusion in a simulation. x-Sim is tightly integrated with the x-kernel architecture; it runs x-kernel protocols and protocols can be moved between the simulator and the x-kernel without any changes. x-Sim Version 1.0 adheres to Version 3.3 of the x-kernel interface <ref> [NSR96] </ref>. Despite the close relationship between x-sim and the x-kernel, there are two important differences between the standard x-kernel and the simulator of which the user should be aware. We discuss these differences here. <p> If later we want to replace RTCP in our simulation with another TCP, or have different TCP protocols running on different hosts, we can do so without recompiling because we've already included these protocols in the simulator. Following the standard x-kernel build procedures defined in the x-kernel Programmer's Manual <ref> [NSR96] </ref>, the above graph.comp file produces an x-sim executable in the build directory. Section 2 shows the xsim.data file that is read at runtime by this executable, resulting in the protocol graph shown in Figure 2. <p> See the "Data Trace Library" section of the x-kernel Programmer's Manual for information on the this tracing facility <ref> [NSR96] </ref>. Also, see the code for the TCP Vegas protocol in /xkernel/simulator/protocols/vtcp for an example of how to augment a protocol with trace statements. The file README.trace in this directory lists all of the protocol's trace statements, and explains where each occurs and what information it saves.
