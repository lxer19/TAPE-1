Abstract: We used Machine Learning (ML) methods to learn the best decision rules to distinguish normal brain aging from the earliest stages of dementia using subsamples of 198 normal and 244 cognitively impaired or very mildly demented (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale=0.5) persons. Subjects were represented by their age, education and gender, plus their responses on the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE), and the Ishihara Color Plate (ICP) tasks. The ML algorithms applied to these data contained within the electronic patient records of a medical relational database, learned rule sets that were as good as or better than any rules derived from either the literature or from domain specific knowledge provided by expert clinicians. All ML algorithms for all runs found that a single question from the FAQ, the forgetting rule, ("Do you require assistance remembering appointments, family occasions, holidays, or taking medications?") was the only attribute included in all rule sets. CART's tree simplification procedure always found that just the forgetting rule gave the best pruned decision tree rule set with classification accuracy (93% sensitivity and 80% specificity) as high as or better than any other decision tree rule-set. Comparison with published classification accuracies for the FAQ and MMSE revealed that including some of the additional attributes in these tests actually worsen classification accuracy. Stepwise logistic regression using the FAQ attributes to classify dementia status confirmed that the forgetting rule gave a much larger odds ratio than any other attribute and was the only attribute included in all of the stepwise logistic regressions performed on 33 random samples of the data. Stepwise logistic regression using the MMSE attributes identified two attributes which occurred in all 33 runs and had by far the highest odds ratio. In summary, ML methods have discovered that the simplest and most sensitive screening test for the earliest clinical stages of dementia consists of a single question, the forgetting rule.

Reference-contexts: The MMSE ranges from 0 (severely impaired) to 30 (no impairment). The occurrence of dementia increases with advancing age and decreases with increasing educational level. Depending upon a subject's age and education, a total MMSE score of 24 or higher is used to classify a subject as normal <ref> [22, 4] </ref>. We examined the sensitivity and specificity of total MMSE scores from 1 to 30 without ML methods. We then aggregated the individual MMSE attributes reflecting short-term recall, orientation to time, and orientation to place into three aggregate attributes respectively.

Reference-contexts: Artificial intelligence approaches to medicine started with knowledge-based systems, which learn from human experts, not data. Beginning with the expert systems of the seventies (MYCIN [28], PUFFS), followed by Bayesian systems of the late eighties and early nineties (ACORN [12],PATHFINDER <ref> [5] </ref>), these knowledge-based systems generated much enthusiasm and hope. But there are very few such actual systems in routine clinical use. Another approach starting in the mid eighties, sought to make use of real data and a domain model for knowledge acquisition and rule learning [3],[18], [15].

Reference-contexts: you see a number on the plate, tell me what it is", and that for the trail-tracing task is, "If you see the trail, trace it from beginning to end." Because it is such a simple task and it appears to discriminate among Alzheimer's, Vascular dementia and Normal aging subjects <ref> [17] </ref>, we included it as a potential screening test. However, examination of the ML classification results with the 21 ICP attributes (see Table 2), showed that it is not sufficiently sensitive for detecting very mild dementia.

They were also classified by dementia severity using standard criteria for the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDRS <ref> [19] </ref>), in which 0 = normal, 0.5 = questionably or very mildly demented, and 1-5 indicate increasing severity of dementia.
