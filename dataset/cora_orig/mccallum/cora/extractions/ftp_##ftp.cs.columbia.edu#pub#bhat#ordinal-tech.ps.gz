Reference-contexts: We present ordinal measures of association <ref> [1] </ref>, [9]) which possess the above desirable qualities to a high degree. <p> The ratio between two measurements is not of consequence; only their relative ordering is relevant. The relative ordering between measurements is expressed by their ranks. A rank permutation is obtained by sorting the sample in ascending order and labeling them using integers <ref> [1; 2; : : : ; n] </ref>, n being the size of the sample. In our application, intensity is viewed as an ordinal variable. Consequently, ordinal correlation measures are based on rank permutations within windows rather than absolute intensity data. <p> We now formally introduce the concepts underlying ordinal measures using distance metrics. 6 3.2 Review A ranking which represents the relative ordering between values of an ordinal variable is simply a permutation of integers. More precisely, if S n denotes the set of all permutations of integers <ref> [1; 2; : : : ; n] </ref>, then any ranking is an element of this set. To define correlation between two rankings 1 ; 2 , we require a measure of closeness a distance metric - between them. <p> metric d ( 1 ; 2 ) is defined, a coefficient of correlation ff can be obtained as: ff = 1 M where M is the maximum value of d ( 1 ; 2 ); 8 ( 1 ; 2 ) 2 S n . ff lies in the range <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. M is attained when the two permutations are reverses of each other, and hence ff = 1. <p> B Distance Vector under Negative Correlation The maximum value that a distance vector component can take must occur when the two rankings being compared are negatively correlated ( or should be equal to 1). When the rankings are negatively correlated, the s permutation (Equation 5) is identical to <ref> [n; n 1; : : : ; 1] </ref>, as shown in Figure 16. <p> Let Q 1 ; Q 2 ; Q 3 ; Q 4 represent Boolean expressions as below: Q 1 : s k Q 2 (j) : s 1 = k; j 2 <ref> [1; k 1] </ref> 2 &gt; k j Note that P k1 P k1 j=1 J (Q 4 (j)) can attain a maximum value of 1 (= True) since only one j can satisfy the the corresponding Boolean expression.

Reference-contexts: Different approaches have been developed to tackle individual issues (for example, <ref> [3] </ref>, [14], [15], [17]) within the framework of linear correlation measures. <p> Further, corresponding intensities are also not related linearly; thus NCC could be a poor estimator of correspondence. Bhat and Nayar <ref> [3] </ref> formulated an approach to determine optimal stereo configurations binocular and trinocular such that intensity differences at corresponding points is limited (in at least one stereo pair, for the case of trinocular configurations), while depth resolution is maximized.

Reference-contexts: The outliers should either be detected and discarded, or the similarity measure used should not be susceptible to their presence. While the former option is not often feasible, linear correlation and SSD are fragile in the presence of outliers <ref> [5] </ref>. In fact, the breakdown point of these measures is zero since a single data value can distort them arbitrarily. 3 As mentioned earlier, intensities in corresponding windows are not identical in the presence of specular reflection. <p> The common characteristic of robust estimators is that they cause outliers to contribute less weight compared to inliers. The Lorentzian estimator : (x) = log (1 + 2 x ) 2 ) (1) has been used for motion estimation <ref> [5] </ref>. Many other estimators have been defined, all of which have a common parameter that needs to be set beforehand: the point at which measurements must be considered outliers (for example, in the Lorentzian of equation 1, determines the threshold).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Stereo systems for depth estimation work reasonably well with smooth surfaces that are mostly Lambertian in reflectance. However, many surfaces in real scenes exhibit sharp discontinuities with non-Lambertian reflectance. It is a challenge for practical systems to produce accurate depth maps in such settings, as noted in <ref> [6] </ref>. In this paper, we present ordinal measures for visual correspondence, in the context of reliable stereo matching. The heart of any window-based method for stereo matching lies in the underlying similarity criterion that determines optimal statistical correlation between windows around corresponding points. <p> However, the increased reliability over SSD and NCC may compensate for the decreased economy in certain applications. 6 Experiments Ideally, we would like to compare our measures with others using dense ground truth, but unfortunately such data is lacking <ref> [6] </ref>. In this paper, we present three experiments which qualitatively substantiate the results presented in section 3.5. The first is a stereo image pair in figure 12 from the Calibrated Imaging Laboratory at CMU [13]. A sequence of images was obtained by moving the camera horizontally. <p> Presumably, the results would improve further if an approach specifically for handling occlusion like in [8] was used in tandem. Finally, we present results on a stereo image pair from the JISCT test evaluation 29 Left Right set <ref> [6] </ref> (called the ARROYO image pair, see Figure 6 (a-b)). The image size is 256 fi 240 and the disparity range is [0 20] pixels. The right image is 25% brighter than the left.

Reference-contexts: Like SSD it appraises the degree of linearity between the samples being compared. It is related to the least squares line of fit <ref> [7] </ref> by: NCC 2 = 1 i=1 (I i 2 + b)) 2 where a; b are regression constants and 2 is the sample variance of I 2 . <p> an ordinal scale of measurement 14 n=25 Outlier Ratio 0.1 0.2 0.3 75.15 83.40 100.32 n=49 Outlier Ratio 0.1 0.2 0.3 351.36 452.28 511.66 Table 1: Normalized standard deviation for each coefficient with different samples. is the price one pays for robustness, and is a well-known trade-off in non-parametric statistics <ref> [7] </ref>. One factor that affects discriminatory power is the window size. The window size determines the amount of sample data that will be used for comparison. When the window size is small, say 3 fi 3, only 5 values (b n 2 c + 1) are possible for . <p> This method of breaking ties ensures that when sample windows correspond, the two rankings are consistent. In other words, our ranking method most favors positive correlation. * Relationship to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic: bears a relationship to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistic <ref> [7] </ref> which is used for testing goodness of fit between two distribution functions. The problem of fitting can be stated as: Given 5 All tied values are assigned ranks identical to the mean of the ranks that they would have had if their values had been slightly different.

Reference-contexts: Note that the results obtained were using pure image matching, i.e without any preprocessing or by using any complex heuristics. Presumably, the results would improve further if an approach specifically for handling occlusion like in <ref> [8] </ref> was used in tandem. Finally, we present results on a stereo image pair from the JISCT test evaluation 29 Left Right set [6] (called the ARROYO image pair, see Figure 6 (a-b)). The image size is 256 fi 240 and the disparity range is [0 20] pixels.

Reference-contexts: We present ordinal measures of association [1], <ref> [9] </ref>) which possess the above desirable qualities to a high degree. <p> Below, we present a method for defining the distance between rank permutations along the lines reported by <ref> [9] </ref>. However, our measure is motivated by the definition of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic, as discussed later. Here we assume that there are no ties in the data. The method to handle tied values is discussed later. <p> Now, a measure of correlation (I 1 ; I 2 ) is defined as: (I 1 ; I 2 ) = 1 i=1 d i b n (7) Unlike <ref> [9] </ref>, we do not consider the deviation from the negative identity permutation since that is computationally more expensive. If I 1 and I 2 are perfectly correlated (s = u), then = 1. It falls to 1 when (I 1 ; I 2 ) are perfectly negatively correlated. <p> A match between two windows would be rejected, if between them is below the appropriate threshold. Unfortunately, the exact distribution of the measures as a function of sample size is not known. However, we can obtain the above table using computer simulation <ref> [9] </ref>. Under the null hypothesis of there being no correlation between the rankings, s can be any member of the universal permutation set S n with equal probability of 1 n! .

Reference-contexts: In our application, intensity is viewed as an ordinal variable. Consequently, ordinal correlation measures are based on rank permutations within windows rather than absolute intensity data. Well-known ordinal measures include the Kendall's t and the Spearman's <ref> [10] </ref>. Both coefficients are relatively unaffected by the presence of random data outliers like noise, in comparison to direct image correlation. However, if the ranks within each window are significantly distorted like in the presence of projective distortion, they are not satisfactory. <p> If the distribution of under H 0 was known, a number of statistical parameters could be studied like the efficiency and power of as a test statistic. Unfortunately, we do not know the behavior of , though it is possible to understand it numerically <ref> [10] </ref>; this study is beyond the scope of the paper. 3.5 Experiments with Synthetic Images We compare our measures with SSD ,NCC , and Zabih and Woodfill rank transform. We use the test suite [2] consisting of four sequences of images 2 generated as benchmarks for matching algorithms. <p> The question then is: What rank should be assigned to the set of tied data values? The use of mid-ranking 5 , a popular technique <ref> [10] </ref> in rank tests, does not help in this case since it assigns identical ranks to all data values within a tied group. Hence, the definition of s in equation 5 remains unclear. <p> The bottom picture shows 28 points for which precise disparity has been obtained using an active range method. Next, we present results with the rather popular stereo image pair of the Pentagon (see Figure 13). The images are of resolution 512 fi 512. Disparity is horizontal in the range <ref> [10; 10] </ref> pixels. We matched the images using two different window sizes: 9 fi 9 and 11 fi 11, and the respective results are shown in figure 6. We also used a threshold of 0:5 on in each case.

Reference-contexts: Using ordinal measures, we could locate upto pixel accuracy. Two approaches could be adopted to achieve this: a) local interpolation of correlation values, and b) an iterative scheme based on non-parametric regression. Iterative approaches based on least squares regression between windows that correspond to pixel accuracy, are used often <ref> [12] </ref>. Non-parametric regression techniques may offer a good solution since they do not make strong model assumptions between the regression variables. Although the issues were presented in the context of stereo matching, they are equally applicable in motion estimation.

Reference-contexts: Note, however, that we do not have to sort a window in the second image every time it slides across through one pixel distance within the search range D, if we use heap-sort in which data is maintained as a heap tree <ref> [16] </ref>. Only delete and insert operations corresponding to difference between the old and the new window, have to be performed. Since each operation is of the order O (log n) and the total number of operations is less than n, this scheme is more economical than sorting anew.
