Abstract: This paper describes a virtual cell concept for the transmission of IP datagrams in mobile computer communications. A virtual cell consists of a group of physical cells whose base stations are implemented by remote bridges and interconnected via high-speed data-gram packet-switched networks, supporting host mobility at the data link layer. Thus, as far as the IP layer is concerned, it appears as if the communication between two mobile hosts in different physical cells were taking place directly as in the same physical cell. It eliminates the necessity of IP-level protocols for mobility management which may interfere with the conventional IP protocol in a practical sense, and achieves a logically flexible coverage area according to mobility and data traffic patterns among physical cells. Virtual Cell Protocol (VCP) which consists of handover, address resolution, and data transfer modules is designed based on the distributed hierarchical location information of mobile hosts. To measure data which will be used as parameters to a performance model for the virtual cell, we implement VCP on a simulated environment.

Even though the details of these mobile host protocols are different, we consider one representative mobile host protocol for each technique, VIP and IPIP, to illustrate common features and problems of integrating host mobility into the IP layer.

To solve this problem, the handover procedure should utilize the multicasting ability of the base station network. <p> To explore a practical solution, we should begin with the assumption that the base station network supports the atomic multicasting by using an existing protocol such as the Trans protocol <ref> [17] </ref>. The basic idea of the Trans protocol is that acknowledgements for multicast messages are piggybacked on messages that are themselves multicast, using a combination of pos-itive and negative acknowledgement strategies.
