Reference-contexts: If the control was constrained independently in each dimension, the problem could be decoupled into two one-dimensional problems, one for each dimension. Each of these one-dimensional problems could be solved with the simple, closed-form bang-bang solution <ref> [ Athans and Falb, 1966 ] </ref> . The magnitude constraint is chosen because it models an omnidirectional robot's dynamic constraints more accurately than independent acceleration constraints. However, finding the exact solution to the problem with an acceleration magnitude constraint requires a computationally expensive procedure. <p> The well-known bang-bang solution to the problem in one dimension <ref> [ Athans and Falb, 1966 ] </ref> can be applied to each dimension independently 1 .

Reference-contexts: Paths which would allow the robot to slip or tip over are avoided. The method, based on Bobrow's method for finding a minimum time trajectory along a specified geometric path <ref> [ Bobrow et al., 1985 ] </ref> , employs an unconstrained optimization of the parameters describing the geometric path of the robot.

Reference-contexts: Mapping a large-scale environment requires combining multiple sensor readings separated by significant distances. But the robot's position error accumulates as it moves, so the estimated relative positions of points separated by long traversals will be subject to considerable error <ref> [ Chatila and Laumond, 1985; Brooks, 1985 ] </ref> . Previous work in robot navigation can be usefully classified according to two characteristics. The first is the modeling of robot dynamics. <p> The low positioning accuracy of mobile robots considerably complicates the mapping of large-scale space. A metrically oriented approach of simply fitting local measurements into a global coordinate frame is vulnerable to positioning error <ref> [ Brooks, 1985; Chatila and Laumond, 1985; Levitt, 1987 ] </ref> . The problem goes beyond a simple distortion of the map: when the robot returns to a previously mapped region, its position estimate may easily be sufficiently displaced that it appears to be a similarly shaped, but different region.

Reference-contexts: This type of problem is avoided by using the qualitative mapping method developed by Kuipers and Byun <ref> [1988; 1991; Byun, 1990] </ref> . Rather than attempting to directly integrate local measurements into a global metrical map, this approach begins by characterizing the qualitative layout of the environment. <p> It must also be able to respond to current sensor information to ensure obstacle avoidance. This chapter discusses two topics. The first is a method for environment exploration and map acquisition developed by Kuipers and Byun <ref> [1988; 1991; Byun, 1990] </ref> . The method develops a topologically correct, metrically approximate map of the environment in a way that is robust in the face of positioning errors. <p> Here, I adopt a qualitative exploration and mapping method which instead discovers qualitative features of the environment to directly create a topological description of the environment with little reliance on error-prone metrical information. This method, developed by Kuipers and Byun <ref> [1988; 1991; Byun, 1990] </ref>, describes the environment in terms of qualitative concepts arising from the robot's sensori-motor interaction with the environment: distinctive places and distinctive paths. Metrical information can be added to this topological framework. <p> A distinctive places can be defined as the location of a local maximum of one of a set of appropriately defined distinctiveness measures. In the implementation of the qualitative mapping strategy in the NX system described by Kuipers and Byun <ref> [1988; 1991; Byun, 1990] </ref>, the distinctiveness measures defined on the robot's local range readings include the following: * Extent of differences in distances to near objects. * Temporal discontinuity in one or more sensors, experienced over a small step. * Extent and quality of symmetry across the center of the robot <p> These experiements are performed in a set of environments that are representative of the environments mapped by the qualitative exploration and mapping system described by Kuipers and Byun <ref> [1988; 1991; Byun, 1990] </ref>. Two levels of error are used corresponding to maximum positioning error 2% and 10% of distance traveled. Because travel times may differ somewhat due to randomness in control outcomes, 10 trials (differing only in the initialization of the random number generator) are performed in each case. <p> A map of the environment is autonomously acquired using Kuipers' and Byun's qualitative mapping approach <ref> [1988; 1991; Byun, 1990] </ref>. The central element of the map is a topological network that describes the environment in terms of qualitative features: distinctive places and distinctive paths. Development of a topologically correct map is robust in the face of positioning errors.

Reference-contexts: This is an appropriate model for omnidirectional mobile robots, which, unlike conventionally-steered vehicles, are not subject to steering curvature constraints. Examples of omnidirectional mobile robots include the Llonator Cart [ Daniel et al., 1985 ] , Uranus [ Moravec, 1986 ] , and the Unimation robot <ref> [ Carlisle, 1983 ] </ref> . Certainly this is not a complete model of the dynamics of any actual mobile robot. However, a high-speed control solution to this system can be used to control a physical omnidirectional robot as follows. The solution is expressed as a sequence of control (acceleration) values.

Reference-contexts: It has been demonstrated that by choosing acceleration and velocity constraints to match the characteristics of a particular robot, the 18 reference trajectory can be quite closely followed by the robot under control of a properly designed servomechanism <ref> [ Feng et al., 1989 ] </ref> . The servoed robot will not follow the reference trajectory exactly, of course, so the actual outcome of applying the servo control will be a trajectory that only approximately behaves as predicted by the model of equation 2.1. <p> Experimental work with mobile robots under servo control indicates that the maximum displacement error from the intended target position due to a movement is proportional to the distance of the movement <ref> [ Feng et al., 1989; Nelson and Cox, 1988 ] </ref> . Position error along the direction of the movement is generally due to wheel slip.

Reference-contexts: When an interval containing an intersection is found, the control type (minimum-time, delay, or backtrack) corresponding to the segment in each dimension should be recorded. The value of theta at the intersection can be found by applying a root-finding algorithm such as the van-Wijngaarden-Dekker-Brent method <ref> [ Press and others, 1992 ] </ref> . This value of theta indicates how much acceleration should be allocated in each dimension. 34 Given the control type and the allocated acceleration, the control for each dimension can be readily generated as described in Tables 3.1 and 3.2.
