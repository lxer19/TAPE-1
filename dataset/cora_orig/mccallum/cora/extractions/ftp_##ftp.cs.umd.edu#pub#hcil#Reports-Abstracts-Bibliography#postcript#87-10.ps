Abstract: Menus are largely formatted in a linear fashion listing items from the top to bottom of the screen or window. Pull down menus are a common example of this format. Bitmapped computer displays, however, allow greater freedom in the placement, font, and general presentation of menus. A pie menu is a format where the items are placed along the circumference of a circle at equal radial distances from the center. Pie menus gain over traditional linear menus by reducing target seek time, lowering error rates by fixing the distance factor and increasing the target size in Fitts's Law, minimizing the drift distance after target selection, and are, in general, subjectively equivalent to the linear style.

Reference-contexts: Pie and linear menus seem to suffer from a similar phenomenon errors are made more often on items in the central region of the menu display. These are the items with the most interaction with neighboring items <ref> (Card, 1982) </ref> Repeated measure analysis of variance results on the error rates show marginally statistically significant differences (P = 0.087) between pie and linear menus (Tables 4 and 5). No other statistically significant differences were observed. Subjective results obtained in the pilot study repeated themselves in the experiment.

Reference-contexts: Table 1 shows an example of the groupings. There are a total of 15 menus, a group of 5 for each task type. Subjects perform the experiment for all cells in the experiment matrix in random order in accordance with a randomized block design <ref> (Kirk, 1968) </ref>. The subjects see each of the 15 menus four times, a total of twice in each menu format. Each cell in the experiment consists of 10 menus. Each subject therefore sees a total of 60 menus. Targets are uniformly distributed over the eight possible items.
