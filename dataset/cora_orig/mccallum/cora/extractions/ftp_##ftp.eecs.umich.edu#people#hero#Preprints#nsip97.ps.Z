Abstract: In [1] a methodology for incorporating extracted MRI anatomical boundary information into penalized likelihood (PL) ECT image reconstructions and tracer uptake estimation was proposed. This methodology used quadratic penalty based on Gibbs weights which enforced smoothness constraints everywhere in the image except across the MRI-extracted boundary of the ROI. When high quality estimates of the anatomical boundary are available and MRI and ECT images are perfectly registered, the performance of this method was shown to be very close to that attainable using ideal side information, i.e. noiseless anatomical boundary estimates. However when the variance of the MRI-extracted boundary estimates becomes significant this penalty function method performs poorly. We give a modified Gibbs penalty function implemented with a set of averaged Gibbs weights, where the averaging is performed with respect to a limiting form of the posterior distribution of the MRI boundary parameters.

APPLICATION TO SPECT/MRI Here we consider the situation treated in <ref> [9] </ref> where MRI-derived anatomical side information is applied to SPECT through the Gibbs weights w i;j . We compare reconstructed images using side information averaged "smoothed weights" ~w ij and the "unsmoothed weights" ~w ij extracted directly from the MRI image. <p> A modified version of the SAGE3 algorithm [17] was used to maximize the penalized likelihood (6). The MRI anatomical boundary estimates were obtained by edge detection and median filtering algorithm discussed in <ref> [9] </ref>. We have shown that the mean-square error of this edge extraction algorithm virtually achieves the CR bound over the practical range of MRI signal-to-noise ratios. This allows us to use an analytical form of the Fisher information, derived in [18], in the smoothing formula (7). <p> Note that without the benefit of MRI side information the smoothing penalty is spatially invariant and therefore the hot spot (small white ellipse) is smoothed into the surrounding anatomy. Figure 3 shows the SAGE3 presented in <ref> [9] </ref> which uses weights derived from the MRI boundary estimate. While the hot spot boundary is sharp in this unsmoothed image it is of irregular shape and underestimates the uptake of the true hot spot.

Reference-contexts: However when the variance of the MRI-extracted boundary estimates becomes significant this penalty function method performs poorly. This poor performance is due in large part to the fact that the Gibbs weights do not account for estimation errors in the anatomical boundary estimates. In <ref> [10] </ref> a technique called "variance corrected weighting" was proposed which relied on a local Taylor series expansion of the Gibbs weights about the estimated spline parameters. This scheme applies only to weight assignments that are smooth functions of the spline parameters for which Taylor series can be applied. <p> This scheme applies only to weight assignments that are smooth functions of the spline parameters for which Taylor series can be applied. Furthermore, even for the smooth weight assignments presented in <ref> [10] </ref> the method is accurate only when the uncertainty in the extracted boundary estimates are less than a single MRI pixel width. Here we derive a variance corrected weighting which applies globally to non-smooth weights. <p> BACKGROUND Let Y E and Y M be two random measurements corresponding to (Poisson) ECT projections and (Gaussian) NMR spin density images, respectively. In <ref> [10] </ref> two differ-ent methodologies were proposed for extracting anatomical boundary estimates from noisy MRI images for the purpose of incorporation into ECT. One was based on non-linear maximum likelihood estimation of coefficients in a periodic B-spline model for the closed boundary. <p> The penalty is of the form of a Gibbs potential function R (; ^ ) = fi i;j where w ij are Gibbs weights which depend on ^ through one of many possible functional assignments <ref> [10, Ch. 4] </ref>. 3.

Reference-contexts: Here we derive a variance corrected weighting which applies globally to non-smooth weights. The method is based on marginalization <ref> [11, Sec 3.2.2] </ref> which averages the penalized likelihood over an asymptotic normal approximation to the posterior distribution of the side information. Jensen's inequality provides a lower bound on the resultant marginal which gives a simple penalty function requiring averaging of the weight maps.

Reference-contexts: When multiple realizations of f (Y M ; ) are available empirical Bayes techniques can be used to accurately estimate the posterior density. Empirical Bayes techniques were formalized by Robbins <ref> [12] </ref> as a methodology for dealing with uncertain parameters. Empirical Bayes results in the substitution of an empirically determined distribution for the unknown prior distribution required for Bayes parameter estimation, e.g. the conditional mean or the posterior mode (maximum a posteriori) estimators.
