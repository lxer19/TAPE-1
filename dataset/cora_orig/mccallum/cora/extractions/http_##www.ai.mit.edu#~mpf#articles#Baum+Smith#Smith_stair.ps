Abstract: The simplest nontrivial monotone functions are "staircases." The problem arises: what is the best approximation of some monotone function f(x) by a staircase with M jumps? In particular: what if f(x) is itself a staircase with N, N &gt; M, steps? This paper considers algorithms for solving, and theorems relating to, this problem. All of the algorithms we propose are space-optimal up to a constant factor and and also runtime-optimal except for at most a logarithmic factor. One application of our results is to "data compression" of probability distributions. We find yet another remarkable property of Monge's inequality, called the "concave cost as a function of zigzag number theorem." This property leads to new ways to get speedups in certain 1-dimensional dynamic programming problems satisfying this inequality.

Reference-contexts: Now, realize that the optimal E has to be a difference x j x i , j &gt; i. Hence we may do an outer binary search in this set of O (N 2 ) differences. According to [mirz85] (other relevant references include [fred84] <ref> [cosn89] </ref> [cosn90]) "se-lection of the kth largest element in the set `X-X' of differences" may be performed in O (N ) steps for any k. Hence each iteration of the binary search takes O (N ) steps and O (log N ) iterations will be needed.

Reference-contexts: This task is precisely what the so-called "SMAWK" algorithm ([agga87] <ref> [gali92] </ref>) is designed to do, in O (N F ) time and O (N ) space for an N fi N matrix, where each entry of the matrix is computible in O (F ) time. (We remark that Wilber and Galil-Park's algorithms from the previous proof, both use calls to the <p> Theorem 22 is a new and important property of the quadrangle inequality which may be used to create new kinds of more-efficient dynamic programming algorithms. (Several properties of the quadrangle inequality have already been exploited by dynamic programmers <ref> [gali92] </ref>; but not this one.) It is interesting to note that our proof depends on the full strength of Monge's inequality and not on the weaker assumption of total mono-tonicity.
