Abstract: Summary We introduce the Coerced Markov Model (CMM) to model the relationship between the lexical sequence of a source language and the tag sequence of a target language, with the objective of constraining search in statistical transfer-based machine translation systems. CMMs differ from Hidden Markov Models in that state sequence assignments can take on values coerced from external sources. Given a Chinese sentence, a CMM can be used to predict the corresponding English tag sequence, thus constraining the English lexical sequence produced by a translation model. The CMM can also be used to score competing translation hypotheses in N-best models. Three fundamental problems for CMM designed are discussed. Their solutions lead to the training and testing stages of CMM.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION The analysis, transfer, and synthesis paradigm for machine translation is readily amenable to statistical methods <ref> (Brown et al. 1993) </ref>. Since the transfer stage is designed to exploit mapping knowledge about different linguistic relationships between the source and target languages, statistical information can be incorporated into this stage. Typical types of mapping relations include sentence to sentence, word to word, or part-of-speech (POS) tags to tags.
