Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 301 Appeared in: Automatic Systems for the Identification and Inspection of Humans, SPIE Vol. 2277, July 1994 Abstract In this paper we describe experiments using eigenfaces for recognition and interactive search in the FERET face database. A recognition accuracy of 99.35% is obtained using frontal views of 155 individuals. This figure is consistent with the 95% recognition rate obtained previously on a much larger database of 7,562 "mugshots" of approximately 3,000 individuals, consisting of a mix of all age and ethnic groups. We also demonstrate that we can automatically determine head pose without significantly lowering recognition accuracy; this is accomplished by use of a view-based multiple-observer eigenspace technique. In addition, a modular eigenspace description is used which incorporates salient facial features such as the eyes, nose and mouth, in an eigen-feature layer. This modular representation yields slightly higher recognition rates as well as a more robust framework for face recognition. In addition, a robust and automatic feature detection technique using eigentemplates is demonstrated.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION In recent years considerable progress has been made on the problems of face detection and recognition, especially in the processing of "mug shots," i.e., head-on face pictures with controlled illumination and scale. The best results have been obtained for 2-D, view-based techniques based on either template matching (e.g., <ref> [2] </ref>), combined feature-and-template matching (e.g., [1]) or matching using "eigen-faces," i.e. template matching using the Karhunen-Loeve transformation of a set of face pictures (e.g., [11, 12, 5]). However to date tests of these methods have been confined to datasets of only a few hundred images. <p> More surprising, perhaps, is the observation that in the lower dimensions of eigenspace, eigenfeatures outperformed the eigenface recognition. Finally, by using the combined representation, we gain a slight improvement in the asymptotic recognition rate (98%). A similar effect has recently been reported by Brunelli and Poggio <ref> [2] </ref> where the cumulative normalized correlation scores of templates for the face, eyes, nose and mouth showed improved performance over the face-only templates. A potential advantage of the eigenfeature layer is the ability to overcome the shortcomings of the standard eigen-face method.

Reference-contexts: One can think of this architecture as a set of parallel "observers" each trying to explain the image data with their set of eigenvectors (see also Darrell and Pentland <ref> [3] </ref>). In this view-based, multiple-observer approach, the first step is to determine the location and orientation of the target object by selecting the eigenspace which best describes the input image. This is accomplished by calculating the residual description error (the "distance-from-face-space" metric [12]) using each viewspace's eigenvec-tors.

Reference-contexts: In addition to head detection and tracking, automatic detection of facial features is also an important component for face recognition. Over the years, various strategies for facial feature detection have been proposed, ranging from the early work of Kanade with edge-map projections <ref> [4] </ref>, to more recent techniques using generalized symmetry operators [10] and multilayer perceptrons [13]. By far, the standard detection paradigm in computer vision is that of simple correlation or template matching. The eigenspace formulation, however, leads to a powerful alternative to simple template matching.

Reference-contexts: This detection strategy is equivalent to matching with eigen-templates and allows for a greater range of distortions in the input signal (including lighting, rotation and scale). In a statistical signal detection framework, the use of eigen-templates has been shown to yield superior performance in comparison with standard matched filtering <ref> [6] </ref>. In the eigenfeature representation the equivalent "distance-from-feature-space" (DFFS) can be effectively used for the detection of facial features. Given an input image, a feature distance-map is built by computing the DFFS at each pixel.

Reference-contexts: Although the application reported in this paper is that of face recognition, the same technique can be applied to recognition and detection of most rigid, roughly convex objects. The general applicability of eigenvector decomposition methods for appearance-based 3D object recognition has recently been convincingly demonstrated by Murase and Nayar <ref> [7] </ref>. 2 PHOTOBOOK: A database tool To date, most face recognition experiments have had at most a few hundred faces. Thus how face recognition performance scales with the number of faces is almost completely unknown.

Reference-contexts: Almost every person has at least two images in the database; several people have many images with varying expression, headwear, facial hair, etc. Photobook is an X-windows browsing tool that allows the user to interactively search through image databases <ref> [8] </ref>. The user begins by selecting the types of faces they wish to examine; e.g., FERET faces or caucasian males from the Media Lab database of 7,562 images. This subset selection is accomplished using an object-oriented database to search through the face image annotations.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we first explore how the eigenface technique of Turk and Pentland [12] scales when applied to much larger recognition problems. We have recently extended the eigenface technique to a view-based and modular framework for automatic detection and recognition <ref> [9] </ref>. The view-based formulation allows us to automatically determine head orientation and scale. The modular description allows for the incorporation of important facial features such as eyes, nose and mouth. <p> This subset of images includes the most recent imagery in which lighting and scale were approximately standardized. As in our previous work <ref> [9] </ref> we have used a view-based recognition paradigm for the multiple head orientations. This yields 5 separate eigen-sapces, one for every available view (frontal, half left, half right, profile left, profile right). Recognition and matching are performed in each space as with the standard eigen-face technique.

In this paper we first explore how the eigenface technique of Turk and Pentland <ref> [12] </ref> scales when applied to much larger recognition problems.

This is accomplished by calculating the residual description error (the "distance-from-face-space" metric <ref> [12] </ref>) using each viewspace's eigenvec-tors. Once the proper viewspace is determined, the image is described using the eigenvectors of that viewspace, and then recognized. We have evaluated this approach using data similar to that shown in Figure 3. <p> The eigenspace formulation, however, leads to a powerful alternative to simple template matching. The reconstruction error (or residual) of the principal component representation (referred to as the "distance-from-face-space" in the context of our earlier work <ref> [12] </ref>) is a an effective indicator of a match. The residual error is easily computed using the projection coefficients and signal energy. This detection strategy is equivalent to matching with eigen-templates and allows for a greater range of distortions in the input signal (including lighting, rotation and scale).
