Title: An Object-Based Neural Model of Serial Processing in Visual Multielement Tracking  
Author: Charles P. Schmitt Jonathan A. Marshall 
Date: October 20, 1998  
Abstract: A quantitative model is provided for psychophysical data on the tracking of multiple visual elements (multielement tracking). The model employs an object-based attentional mechanism for constructing and updating object representations. The model selectively enhances neural activations to serially construct and update the internal representations of objects through correlation-based changes in synaptic weights. The correspondence problem between items in memory and elements in the visual input is resolved through a combination of top-down prediction signals and bottom-up grouping processes. Simulations of the model on image sequences used in multielement tracking experiments show that reported results are consistent with a serial tracking mechanism that is based on psychophysical and neurobiological findings. In addition, simulations show that observed effects of perceptual grouping on tracking accuracy may result from the interactions between attention-guided predictions of object location and motion and grouping processes involved in solving the motion correspondence problem.

Reference-contexts: The connection weight from neuron j to neuron i is w ji . All parameters, weight values, and activation values are in the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. <p> All weights are constrained to the range <ref> [w min ; 1] </ref> and have initial value w base . d w ji = S d (w base w ji ) + S c (x i T wpost )(x j T wpre ) S a (x i T wpost )(T wpre x j ) According to this rule, the weight <p> Second, the elements used in the original experiments are small (max size of 0.42 degree). The receptive field sizes of neurons in motion processing areas such as MT are typically larger than the elements (Albright <ref> [1] </ref> reported mean receptive 28 field size of MT neurons to be approximately 10 degrees) and would therefore be relatively insensitive to element shape. The tracking accuracy of the model was tested using the same methods used in the original experiments.

Reference-contexts: This last category of cells was termed `what-where' cells as the neurons were highly selective for both object and location, suggesting that these cells integrate spatial and non-spatial object information in memory. Finally, studies have shown delay-period activity related to spatial information and object information <ref> [2, 54, 64] </ref> in prefrontal cortex. These findings are significant as delay-period activity is thought to be one mechanism used to actively maintain memory representations.

Reference-contexts: Rock and Gutman found that only the attended object affected the subject's performance on a subsequent surprise recognition task, indicating that a memory representation was formed only for the attended object.

In the first approach, processing is allocated to features in the visual input based upon spatial location. This viewpoint posits that a single spatial locus (typically convex) of attentional selection exists outside of which processing of visual information is suppressed.

Reference-contexts: This measure, therefore, favors parallel motions; unlike dist p which favors motions with a common origin, and therefore acts to enforce the common fate constraint <ref> [9] </ref>. In summary, the spatial map is a simple network that detects all possible correspondence matches and biases the support for each match based on a few factors derived from neurobiology and psychophysics. Three of the biasing factors, nearest neighbor, common fate, and element integrity, are known from psychophysical experiments ([61],[9])

Reference-contexts: Neurobiological findings from several researchers have shown that attention leads to enhanced activation 13 of neurons responsive to properties of the attended object. Such enhanced activation has been shown to exist in prefrontal cortex <ref> [11] </ref> as well as cortical areas in both the dorsal and ventral pathways ([60, 30, 39, 4]) that process object form and object location/motion information. Based on these findings, object representations can be constructed using the memory system shown in figure 3 as follows.

Reference-contexts: These findings are significant as delay-period activity is thought to be one mechanism used to actively maintain memory representations. Other studies have also shown that neurons active during the delay-periods are responsive to different objects and locations and the same neuron repeatedly respond to the same location or object <ref> [13, 64] </ref>. In there experiments, Rao et al.![44] found that the number of 'what-where' neurons was approximately equal to the number of 'what' neurons and the number of 'where' neurons.

Reference-contexts: This task requires differentiating which active neurons correspond to which objects (i.e., solving the binding problem). Many researchers have proposed that the binding problem may be solved through synchronization of neural firing ([37, 31]). Indeed, there does exist biological support for the existence of neural synchronization <ref> [14, 51] </ref>. It is far less clear, however, that observed synchronization is related to perceptual organization in visual processing. Only a few studies have demonstrated evidence that synchronization is used in grouping visual elements [14, 28] while other studies [17, 55] have failed to find such evidence. <p> Indeed, there does exist biological support for the existence of neural synchronization [14, 51].

Reference-contexts: Support for this claim comes from several lines of research.

Reference-contexts: These connections arise mainly from pyramidal cells and often synapse on other pyramidal cells, indicating that the effects of these connections are often excitatory. Hirsch and Gilbert <ref> [20] </ref> found that the effects of these connections are modulated by voltage dependent sodium channels 17 so that the EPSPs evoked by pre-synaptic action potentials increases with increased depolarization of the post-synaptic target. <p> The thresholds prevent input through weak connections or from weakly active neurons from influencing network behavior. Modulatory inputs differ from non-modulatory input only in that the post synaptic activation must be above the preset threshold value post . This formulation is based on the finding of Hirsch and Gilbert <ref> [20] </ref> that long-range horizontal connections have little effect on post-synaptic spiking unless the post-synaptic neuron is already receiving excitation from other sources. Within the model, the non-modulatory connections provide the primary input to each neuron, thereby defining the neuron's receptive field.

Reference-contexts: The passive decay causes all weights to slowly decay towards the base value w min , allowing for the slow "forgetting" of short-term memories. The active strengthening and decay of weights 26 within the memory system is consistent with findings (see Jay et al. <ref> [22] </ref> for review) showing both short-term synaptic enhancement of afferent pathways (through high-frequency stimulation) to prefrontal cortex and reversal of short-term enhancement (through low-frequency stimulation). In the simulations, the value of S c is kept slightly higher than S a .

In multielement tracking experiments (figure 1), researchers test human subjects on their ability to track several identical, independently moving elements (targets) within a display containing other identical and independently moving elements (distractors). <p> For a more thorough review of these issues, see [7, 27]. 2.2 Evidence for parallel updating of object representations In presenting the multielement tracking paradigm, Pylyshyn and Storm <ref> [42] </ref> argued that a serial, location-based process cannot be solely responsible for visual tracking. Their argument was based on a theoretical analysis of the tracking accuracy of a serial tracking mechanism. <p> of strong connections between association neurons and neurons in the spatial map) is set at the start of each trial. 5 Simulations 5.1 Methods For each simulated experiment, 200 image sequences were generated according to the methods used for image sequence generation in the original experiment (see Pylyshyn and Storm <ref> [42] </ref> and Yantis [65] for details). In addition, each element was treated internally as a single dot instead of a plus sign as used in the original experiments (although the image sequences were generated using plus signs). This simplification is justified for two reasons. <p> 32 The parameters T wpre and T pred affect the overall tracking accuracy of the model and were set using the false alarm (subject indicated target when a distractor was probed) and miss (subject indicated distractor when a target was probed) rates found in experiment two of Pylyshyn and Storm <ref> [42] </ref>. Increasing parameter T wpre increases the number of targets lost during tracking by increasing the activation level required before the adaptive weights can change (see the weight update rule in section 4). <p> In their second set of experiments, Pylyhsyn and Storm <ref> [42] </ref> intentionally changed the display conditions to stress the capability of a serial process. This was done by increasing the mean velocity of elements, increasing the rate at which element trajectories changed, and requiring that another element always be close to each target. <p> The results in this paper show that a model of human vision based on a serial, object-based tracking mechanism can operate within the same performance range as human visual systems do under a variety of different stimulus conditions using a single parameter set (a prior analysis from Pylyshyn and Storm <ref> [42] </ref> indicated that a serial, location-based mechanism cannot reach human performance). Thus the claim cannot be made that the ability of humans to track multiple objects necessitates an attentional system capable of handling multiple objects simultaneously (at least in the construction and update of the internal representation of objects). <p> The model is simulated on mul-tielement tracking experiments experiments that stress the visual system's capability to update internal representations of multiple moving objects. The results of these simulations show that the model provides a close match to psychophysical data from multielement tracking experiments performed by Pylyshyn and Storm <ref> [42] </ref> and by Yantis [65].

Reference-contexts: The observation, however, that tracking accuracy decreases as the number of targets increases does suggest (as noted by Pylyshyn and Storm) either that some serial processing is occurring or that a parallel tracking mechanism is involved that is resource-limited in some manner. Pylyshyn <ref> [43] </ref> has favored an approach in which a small number of indexes, each of which maintains the location of a visual item, can be updated in parallel. <p> It is worth noting that additional support for this approach comes from multiple-cue studies and subitizing studies <ref> [43] </ref> as well as illusory line motion studies [48]. <p> Second, convex hull violations may 7 act as perceptual clues to break apart a group of targets, thereby increasing the number of groups being tracked and reducing accuracy. Pylyshyn et al. <ref> [43] </ref> have also taken the view that high level processes are involved in the grouping effects observed by Yantis. They suggested that error recovery processes are invoked when a subject loses a target.

Reference-contexts: First, several researchers have reported that prefrontal cortex is subdivided into regions containing neurons responsive to either spatial information (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) or object information (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) Second, Rao et al. <ref> [44] </ref> have found that neurons responsive during delay-period activation appear to be encoding either object information, location information, or both object and location information. <p> The model also uses local, correlation-based rules for changing weights, allowing for the construction and updating of internal object representations. The model is composed of only two layers: the association network which contains neurons whose firing properties are similar to 'what-where' neurons identified by Rao <ref> [44] </ref> (in prefrontal cortex) and the spatial map which contains neurons that respond to local motion signals in the visual field (similar to neurons in several cortical areas including V1, MT, parietal cortex, and prefrontal cortex).

Reference-contexts: This task requires differentiating which active neurons correspond to which objects (i.e., solving the binding problem). Many researchers have proposed that the binding problem may be solved through synchronization of neural firing ([37, 31]). Indeed, there does exist biological support for the existence of neural synchronization <ref> [14, 51] </ref>. It is far less clear, however, that observed synchronization is related to perceptual organization in visual processing. Only a few studies have demonstrated evidence that synchronization is used in grouping visual elements [14, 28] while other studies [17, 55] have failed to find such evidence.

Reference-contexts: This last category of cells was termed `what-where' cells as the neurons were highly selective for both object and location, suggesting that these cells integrate spatial and non-spatial object information in memory.

These findings are significant as delay-period activity is thought to be one mechanism used to actively maintain memory representations.

Reference-contexts: Such an approach is suggested from research on attentional processing in paradigms outside of multielement tracking. 2.5 Evidence for preattentive perceptual grouping Visual search <ref> [56] </ref> is another important paradigm that researchers in psychophysics use to probe whether processing of visual stimuli is serial or parallel. In search experiments, subjects are typically shown a display containing a number of objects that are similar in some regard and an object that differs.

Reference-contexts: These results suggest that some amount of perceptual grouping of visual elements occurs independent of attentional processing (i.e., preattentive grouping). This viewpoint is supported by research on illusory conjunctions (cases where subjects falsely identify a feature of one object as belonging to a different object) <ref> [57] </ref>. Several researchers ([21, 26, 3]) have shown that illusory conjunctions are more likely to occur between visual stimuli that are perceptually relatable (e.g., move in similar direction, nearby in space) even if the stimuli are not the subject of attention.

Reference-contexts: The problem of piecing together the properties of objects over time has been termed the temporal binding problem <ref> [35, 59] </ref>, and the constructed internal representations have been given a variety of names, e.g., object files [24], object tokens [25], and FINSTs [42].

Reference-contexts: Although the exact structure of these pathways may differ from the pathways that mediate top-down attentional selection in biological systems, it is still possible to model the actual effect of these pathways based on biological data. In particular, recent results from Treue and Maunsell <ref> [60] </ref> describe the effect of attentional selection on the mean firing rates of neurons in areas MT and MST of the macaque monkey. <p> In particular, Treue and Maunsell <ref> [60] </ref> showed that attentional selection leads to an approximately 30% increase in the mean firing rates of neurons within MT and MST associated with the attended object. <p> Of importance is that the model is based only upon known properties of biological visual systems. Specifically, the model uses attention-based enhancement of neural activation (shown to exist in several cortical areas [36],[30], <ref> [60] </ref>) to differentiate neurons associated with attended visual elements from other active neurons (i.e., to solve the binding problem). The model also uses local, correlation-based rules for changing weights, allowing for the construction and updating of internal object representations.

Reference-contexts: In multielement tracking experiments, one likely source of preattentive grouping comes from the processing of motion signals. Researchers ([9], <ref> [61] </ref>) have shown that in 2-D displays, motion perception is affected by three constraints that act to determine how our visual system solves the motion correspondence problem: nearest neighbor, common fate, and element integrity.

Reference-contexts: Neurons in prefrontal cortex are selective to visual spatial and object information, reflecting the strong connections the region receives from areas LIP, VIP, 7a, MST, and MT involved in extracting visual spatial information as well as from areas TEO and TE, which are thought to process visual object information <ref> [62] </ref>. Studies of single neuron activity during delayed-response tasks show sustained activity during delay periods that appears to be related to performance on memory tasks ([47],[13]) and that is not maskable [64] (unlike delay period activity found in inferior temporal cortex or posterior parietal cortex).
