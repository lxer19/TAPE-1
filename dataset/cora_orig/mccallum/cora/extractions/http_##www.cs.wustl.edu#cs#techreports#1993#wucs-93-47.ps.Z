Abstract: Many multipoint virtual circuit switching systems have been proposed for use in ATM networks. The inherent flexibility of ATM networks and the desire to use them for a wide range of different applications makes it impractical to rely upon statistical traffic models, motivating a renewed interest in nonblocking networks. While the various multipoint architectures can all be configured to be nonblocking, for most, the cost quickly becomes prohibitive. We examine the complexity of several multipoint switch architectures, taking into account the switching network, the memory needed for routing and the effort required to create or modify a virtual circuit. We show that a simple nonblocking architecture, based on the concept of cell recycling, achieves optimal complexity. This architecture exemplifies a class of networks which we refer to as reroutably nonblocking.

Reference-contexts: An example, illustrating the operation of Lee's architecture is shown in Figure 3. While a variety of point-to-point switches can be used in this architecture, the original intent was that it would be used with an unbuffered switching network based on Batcher's bitonic sorter <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For h = k 1, this is simply ` (C) ff. That is, the load on the internal links of the network is bounded by the load on the inputs and outputs. Hence, the only speedup needed in the network is that required to accommodate queueing effects. From <ref> [2] </ref> it is apparent that if the network is constructed from shared buffer switches with d 8 and 4d buffer slots, a speed advantage as low as 20% can suffice. This analysis implies that the switching network complexity needed to achieve non- blocking operation is O (n log n).

Buffered Multistage Networks with Fixed Path Routing The Prelude project of the early 1980s <ref> [3] </ref> introduced a multipoint switch architecture based on a natural extension of classical synchronous time division switching systems. Several manufacturers have adopted variations of this architecture in their current ATM switching products.

Reference-contexts: We conclude with a 2 Jonathan S.

Lee's Multipoint Switch Architecture Lee <ref> [4] </ref> describes a multipoint switch architecture that uses unbuffered switching components and a novel contention resolution scheme to handle the fanout contention associated with multipoint virtual circuits. The design is shown in Figure 2.

Reference-contexts: Since for any fixed clock rate an increase in speed advantage requires increasing data path width, the cost of a system grows with giving an overall system cost that is O (n log n). In <ref> [5] </ref>, it is shown that for point-to-point virtual circuits it is necessary to have 1 + 2 (1 + (d 1)(k 1))=d when h = k 1 (that is, for the Benes network, which provides the best performance for this class of networks) which implies that the system complexity is O

Reference-contexts: We note that these memory estimates underestimate the real system complexity since the required speed advantage would force a more costly memory organization as well. This can increase the real cost of the lookup tables by another factor of n. In <ref> [6] </ref>, it is shown that by cascading two Benes networks together, one can achieve nonblocking operation for new virtual circuits (but not necessarily for extending an existing virtual circuit) with the same speed advantage required for point-to-point virtual circuits.

Reference-contexts: To determine the necessary speed advantage, we can apply an analytical technique developed in <ref> [7] </ref>. <p> By an analysis similar to the one given above, it has been shown that the networks require only a small constant speed advantage (with the exact speed advantage depending on the number of traffic distribution stages in the copy and routing networks) <ref> [7] </ref>. Hence, the network complexity is O (n log n). Each of the n lookup tables requires an entry for each of the mn multipoint virtual circuits and each entry stores information relating to a single output of a virtual circuit.

Reference-contexts: However <ref> [10] </ref> develops a series of improvements which taken together lead to version that can be configured for nonblocking operation with O (mn 2 ) words of memory. For this configuration, the number of memory words that must be changed to modify a multipoint virtual circuit is O (n). 3. <p> Jonathan S. Turner 5 There are many specific multistage interconnection network topologies that can be used. The extended delta networks <ref> [10] </ref> form a general class that includes the well-known delta network and the Benes network as special cases. Let d 2, k 0, 0 h &lt; k be integers and let n = d k . <p> Multipoint Switching with Cell Recycling Another approach for switching multipoint virtual circuits is based on the concept of cell recycling <ref> [10] </ref>. This is illustrated in Figure 4. To implement a multipoint virtual circuit, a binary tree is constructed with the source port at its root and the destination ports at its leaves. <p> To ensure that cell ordering is maintained, cells taking the shorter path must be delayed for up to twice the usual amount of time, to give cells on the longer path time to catch up. A mechanism implementing this is described in <ref> [10] </ref>. From the system complexity standpoint, the main impact is to double the size of the resequencer over what would be required otherwise. <p> For F = n, this results in an O ((log n) 2 ) delay which is clearly not optimal. While in some contexts, this delay could be an issue, it is shown in <ref> [10] </ref> that for practical systems with n = F = 2 16 , the worst-case delay associated with recycling be kept below 500 s, making it smaller than the typcial delay in a digital time division circuit switch and completely negligible relative to the transmission delays associated with wide area network <p> It should also be noted that the recycling approach leads to neither a strictly or wide-sense nonblocking system, but rather a reroutably nonblocking system. A more detailed account of the recycling architecture, including a number of practical design refinements can be found in <ref> [10] </ref>. 12 Optimal Nonblocking Multipoint Virtual Circuit Switching 7. Conclusions the recycling architecture offers optimal complexity in all three dimensions.
