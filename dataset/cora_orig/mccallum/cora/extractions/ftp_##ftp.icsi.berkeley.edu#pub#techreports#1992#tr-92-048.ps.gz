Abstract: This paper attempts to exemplify the advantages of perceptually grounded semantics with respect to traditional formalist approaches in elucidating the nature of the controversial notion of linguistic polysemy, or multiplicity of meaning. It is also suggested how some aspects of language typically associated with compositionality could be modeled, without there being a strictly "compositional semantics". This is done through a series of experiments, using modifications of Terry Regier's connectionist system for learning spatial relations [Regier, 1992] which constitutes a part of the L 0 project concerned with associating descriptions in an arbitrary language with an analog environment, (sequences of) pictures of simple 2-dimensional scenes. Three kinds of connectionist architectures have been used in trying to capture what might be called a "polysemous over". It is suggested that the first seems to treat polysemy like what has traditionally been regarded as generality, where distinctions

Reference-contexts: Virtually all perceptually grounded learning systems are connectionist in one form or another, due to the exteremly useful properties of (artificial) neural networks as a means for "the study of change" (cf. <ref> [Bates and Elman, 1992] </ref>). 1.2 The task of this paper The present work is not committed to any of the theoretical stances on the status of the emergent structures that arise in a perceptually grounding learning system, but makes the following methodological assumption: Through examining the emergent structures of a perceptually

Reference-contexts: If we were not constrained by the limits of the L 0 domain, the list could go on much longer: As <ref> [Brugman, 1981] </ref> and [Lakoff, 1987] have demonstrated in a descriptive framework and [Harris, 1989] in a connectionist, but non-perceptual system, English `over' is a perfect example of polysemy. <p> First of all, it is unrealistic to expect an adequate notion of covering, which seems to be necessary for (7-8), to be learned from only 2-dimensional pictures. Sentences like (6) involve according to <ref> [Brugman, 1981] </ref> a reflexive landmark: a single object is viewed as both trajector and landmark, thus is oriented with respect to itself (at a different location). <p> Such sentences, though more clearly within the domain, are beyond the scope of Regier's system because of its requirement that trajector and landmark are two distinct, and pre-labelled objects. Likewise with (5), which would, again according to <ref> [Brugman, 1981] </ref>, be an instance of end-point focus, which is the term used in cognitive linguistics when the end-point of a path | in the case of (5) the imaginary path from the square to the circle | is especially prominent.

Reference-contexts: This is exactly the problem that perceptually grounded semantics is to address.

Reference-contexts: Polysemy has been a phenomenon about which the formalist approach has had practically nothing to say, with its insistence on well-defined, and disambiguated meanings. However, a recent school within linguistics with unmistakably anti-formalist leanings, namely cognitive linguistics (cf. <ref> [Langacker, 1987; Lakoff, 1987] </ref>) has taken polysemy | and the phenomenon of metaphor with which it is closely related | as an important indicator of the nature of language and meaning. <p> If we were not constrained by the limits of the L 0 domain, the list could go on much longer: As [Brugman, 1981] and <ref> [Lakoff, 1987] </ref> have demonstrated in a descriptive framework and [Harris, 1989] in a connectionist, but non-perceptual system, English `over' is a perfect example of polysemy. <p> analysis, I distinguished between 4 "kinds" of over that were all within the domain of the system (as discussed in section 2.3): 9 It should be mentioned that this and the other analyses of the activations of the hidden layers presumes that categorization is done on the basis of similarity. <ref> [Lakoff, 1987] </ref>, for example, has argued that there are other factors such as mataphorical extensions and "image-schema transformations" that play an important role in categorization. 10 This is an important structural feature of Regier's system, captured by the nature of the motion module. <p> Given a richer environment, perceptually grounding systems could learn to pick up on "features" such as access, or end-pont focus. It is thus not clear that e.g. the "image-schema transformations" claimed by 39 <ref> [Lakoff, 1987] </ref> to be necessary for the formation of "natural categories" are required as more than a convenient descriptive notion for certain recurrent meaning correlations.

Reference-contexts: My foot hurts. Still, the two uses of `foot' seem to be not unrelated, and a possible motivation for the relatedness of the polysemy of `foot' would be a (fairly degenerate) `mountain as body' metaphor (cf. <ref> [Lakoff and Johnson, 1980] </ref>). Polysemy is most often contrasted with homonymy, on the one side, and generality or vagueness, on the other.

For our purposes English `in' is interesting, because at first glance it seems to involve something resembling polysemy. Figure 7 shows the positive examples of such a training set actually used by Regier.

Reference-contexts: So to explain polysemy, one would have to give answers to questions such as: What is a "sense"/"meaning" of a lexical item (word)? In which ways can "distinct" senses be "related"? Why should the words of human languages display polysemy at all? 3 <ref> [Regier, 1992] </ref>, for example, introduces his section on polysemy with the sentence "Polysemy is a linguistic phenomenon whereby a single word has a cluster of distinct but related senses."

Reference-contexts: Flexibility is clearly a critical feature of a system which must be able to adapt itself to the spatial system of any natural language." (p. 63) Using a version of the backpropagation algorithm <ref> [Rumelhart et al., 1986] </ref>, Regier's system is to learn to output the appropriate spatial relation between the two objects. The subtask performed by Regier's system is illustrated in Figure 4 5 .

Reference-contexts: generally acknowledged assumption that spatial relations in human languages are not "purely spatial", i.e. disembodied from the physical and functional properties of the given trajectors, landmarks and motions. (b) The lack of any role in the microdomain of gravity and other "force-dynamic" aspects in the relation between the objects (cf. <ref> [Talmy, 1987] </ref>), while such factors still obviously influence judgements of adequacy in the formation of training sets (the sets of pictures presented to the system as input during training) as well as the evaluation of the performance on test sets ("novel" pictures presented to the system, after it has learned the

Reference-contexts: To allow modeling, however, all current perceptually ground 1 This is the title of an intriguing polemical paper by Varela <ref> [Varela, 1992] </ref>, that proposes the notion of enaction as a new paradigm in cognitive science where cognition is seen as "Effective action: History of structural coupling which enacts (brings forth) a world." and this is achieved "[t]hrough a network of interconnected elements capable of structural changes undergoing an uninterrupted history."

Reference-contexts: Furthermore such projects use undeniably "scientific" tools such as computational modeling, and can not be accused of being "merely speculative", the stock reply by formalists to such serious criticisms of their presuppositions as those expressed in [Dreyfus, 1991] and <ref> [Winograd and Flores, 1987] </ref>.
