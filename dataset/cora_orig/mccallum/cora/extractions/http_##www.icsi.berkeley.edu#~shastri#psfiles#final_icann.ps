Abstract: Any intelligent system, whether human or robotic, must be capable of dealing with patterns over time. Temporal pattern processing can be achieved if the system has a short-term memory capacity (STM) so that different representations can be maintained for some time. In this work we propose a neural model wherein STM is realized by leaky integrators in a self-organizing system. The model exhibits composition-ality, that is, it has the ability to extract and construct progressively complex and structured associations in an hierarchical manner, starting with basic and primitive (temporal) elements.

For example, visual recognition of complex objects and events requires the rapid assembly of diverse information about the subcomponents of the object or event.

Reference-contexts: The unification among different maps is realized by a synchronization of the activity of appropriate nodes across these maps. Due to space limit, this paper present only a condensed description of the whole model. A complete description can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. 2 Dynamic Self-Organization computational Maps Temporal processing requires a STM capacity in order to represent different temporal components over a window of time. We use an extended form of SOM that exhibits the necessary STM property. <p> All movements are sampled at various time interval and for each interval the most active elements are allowed to fire. A global competitive mechanism among the elements of a map (see for example [6]) together with an absolute refractory period (ARP) [5] <ref> [2] </ref> prevents elements that represent different trajectories from firing at the same time. The map at level two analyses all the possible pairs of impulses from the first level which represent different trajectories, and produces output impulses representing the mean and the difference of the corresponding angles.

Reference-contexts: Thus one can view each element as a recognizer of a complex event. In view of the above, each element is composed of a set of sub-elements | classically called taps <ref> [3] </ref> | each of which represents different critical points in the temporal evolution of the input vector. Specifically, if an element recognizes an event composed of m temporal features, it consists of m distinct taps. <p> The time constant t i governs the delay limit between two sequential temporal features recognizing and the STM of the integrating neuron. The learning of tap weights can be done in a traditional Hebbian manner exploiting for each iteration an unique vector 2 &lt; Kfim . In <ref> [3] </ref> an alternative learning method has been presented where the taps are learned in real time using a sequence of input vectors.

Reference-contexts: Thus the membrane potential of an element is correlated with the temporal evolution of its input and the element can not only analyze a static input vector *, it can also perform a temporal integration of the function u i (*(t)) (hence the name, Leaky Integrator element (see for example <ref> [4] </ref>)). If this temporal integration depends on the occurrence of certain spatio-temporal features/subevents in the evolving temporal input, then the activation of the element indicates the occurrence of an external event composed of these subevents. Thus one can view each element as a recognizer of a complex event.

Reference-contexts: The input scene consists of one or more dots moving in a two-dimensional space.

Reference-contexts: A particularly promising hypothesis is that all information pertaining to a single entity is bound together as a result of the synchronous firing of the various nodes encoding information about this entity <ref> [7] </ref>. Thus compositionality, binding, and temporal pattern processing are interrelated and seem to play an essential role in cognition. In this work, compositionality is achieved by a hierarchical model of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and the temporal processing ability is achieved by exploiting neurons capable of supporting short-term memory (STM).
