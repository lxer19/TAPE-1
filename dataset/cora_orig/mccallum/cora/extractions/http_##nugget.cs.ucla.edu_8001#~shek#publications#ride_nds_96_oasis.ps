Abstract: A year's worth (sampled twice a day) of sea level pressure data (single precision floating point) generated by UCLA AGCM model with a 4 ffi Latitude by 5 ffi Longitude grid cell resolution is 9250560 bytes (730x44x72x4). Each grid "slice" is therefore 12672 bytes. In this example, the dataset was stored in a HDF file located on the same machine as the MD-CellularGridCoverage object, and the client was run on a different Sparc 20 Model 71 on the same LAN (10baseT). Given a query to retrieve the entire year's worth of data, the object returns an iterator to the result set. A user can ask for a slice at a time or a n slices at a time. The times below are the total elapsed time to query and retrieve the entire dataset. Asking the iterator object for a slice of data at a time (i.e. 730 CORBA/object calls) took 38.45 seconds. Asking for 64, 128, and 730 slices at a time took 21.88, 23.30, 24.76 seconds, respectively. The FeatureBucket and the FeatureTable provide a container for lightweight GIS objects. In the current implementation, both objects store the "states" of their feature elements (i.e. points, polygons) as records in the Illustra DBMS. We use Illustra's Spatial Blade (abstract data types and methods) to define the lightweight spatial types, i.e. their temporal and spatial attributes, their meta data and user-defined attributes. Feature access is optimized using R-trees for the spatial attributes. Preliminary performance analysis shows that creating 100 polygon features, each polygon consisting of 30 points, takes about 94 seconds while performing spatio-temporal queries takes around 1 second. FeatureTable objects have similar performance characteristics. The major difference between the two object types is the time taken to retrieve features from their query result set iterators. A next call on a FeatureBucket's iterator returns a feature as a value structure in 0.02 seconds. A FeatureTable's iter-ator returns a geometry object (a full-blown CORBA object) in 0.1 seconds. We plan to further investigate the performance of these objects by running the FeatureBucket and FeatureTable object servers inside client process walls and by employing other spatial DBMSs for feature storage. The current implementation of the Mediator, Catalog Wrappers, and Catalogs all support the same data model (i.e. translation from a global schema to a Catalog's local schema is straightforward, requiring only a mapping from Illustra SQL data types into CORBA data types). Efforts are underway to integrate EOSDIS's IMS Catalog located at the Goddard Space Flight Center. This catalog supports a proprietary query language and communication protocol. The Catalog Wrapper for this catalog will actually perform the required query and schema translation into NASA's Object Definition Language, send the request to the GSFC DAAC, and perform the inverse mapping of query results. In this paper, we presented the goals, functionality, architecture and preliminary results of OASIS, a flexible, extensible, and seamless environment for scientific data analysis, knowledge discovery, visualization, and collaboration. OASIS offers scientists as well as application developers a view of the world as a collection of distributed, location- and platform independent objects. This view is achieved for application developers through the usage of well-known object interfaces based on OGIS, and object implementations based on CORBA. The view of the world as location-independent objects is offered to scientists via high-level applications such as the OASIS Catalog Browser which provides query facilities to locate geodatasets, as well as visualization and analysis tools which directly deal with OASIS data objects.
