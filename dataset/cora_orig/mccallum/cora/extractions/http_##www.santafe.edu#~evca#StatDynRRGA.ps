Abstract: Metastability is a common phenomenon. Many evolutionary processes, both natural and artificial, alternate between periods of stasis and brief periods of rapid change in their behavior. In this paper an analytical model for the dynamics of a mutation-only genetic algorithm (GA) is introduced that identifies a new and general mechanism causing metastability in evolutionary dynamics. The GA's population dynamics is described in terms of flows in the space of fitness distributions. The trajectories through fitness distribution space are derived in closed form in the limit of infinite populations. We then show how finite populations induce metastability, even in regions where fitness does not exhibit a local optimum. In particular, the model predicts the occurrence of "fitness epochs"| periods of stasis in population fitness distributions|at finite population size and identifies the locations of these fitness epochs with the flow's hyperbolic fixed points. This enables exact predictions of the metastable fitness distributions during the fitness epochs, as well as giving insight into the nature of the periods of stasis and the innovations between them. All these results are obtained as closed-form expressions in terms of the GA's parameters. An analysis of the Jacobian matrices in the neighborhood of an epoch's metastable fitness distribution allows for the calculation of its stable and unstable manifold dimensions and so reveals the state space's topological structure. More general quantitative features of the dynamics|fitness fluctuation amplitudes, epoch stability, and speed of the innovations|are also determined from the Jacobian eigenvalues. The analysis shows how quantitative predictions for a range of dynamical behaviors, that are specific to the finite population dynamics, can be derived from the solution of the infinite population dynamics. The theoretical predictions are shown to agree very well with statistics from GA simulations. We also discuss the connections of our results with those from population genetics and molecular evolution theory.

In that model one considers the evolutionary dynamics of the distribution of different self-replicating molecular "genotypes". Therefore, the Eigen model equations are again defined on the microscopic level, not on a coarse-grained level such as that of fitness distributions. <p> Notably, the asymptotic distribution ~ V N over the different fitness classes is analogous to what is called a quasispecies in molecular evolution theory <ref> [11] </ref>. A species|a particular virus for instance|cannot in general be identified with a certain unique genotype. In fact, the genotypes of members of a certain species can often be thought of as a cloud of points in sequence space that is centered around a genotype of highest fitness.

Reference-contexts: During the evolution of a population there are large proportions of the sequence space that the population has never visited which might contain higher fitness strings than the current fittest genotypes. As already pointed out by Eigen and his colleagues <ref> [12, 32] </ref>, the population will therefore reside in a metastable quasispecies distribution (or "metaspecies") until a mutation discovers one of the higher fitness strings. <p> It has been assumed that after some time, the population is likely to be found localized around some suboptimal fitness peak in the sequence space. This notion of locality is also common in the analysis of quasispecies in the molecular evolution theory <ref> [12] </ref>. There, the population consists of a cloud of mutants around a local fitness optimum called the "wild type".

Reference-contexts: A commonly observed qualitative behavior is that the mean of some state variable alternates between periods of stasis and sudden change. We would like to suggest that this sort of punctuated equilibrium behavior <ref> [23] </ref> can be explained in terms of the simple mechanism presented here.

Reference-contexts: The fact that all unaligned blocks in the population are the same at the start of an epoch will cause the epoch to be longer on average than it would be if all unaligned blocks were independent.

Reference-contexts: Royal Road fitness functions were initially designed to address questions about the processing and recombination of schemata in genetic algorithms. They were thought to lay out a "royal road" for genetic algorithm search <ref> [34] </ref> and so could test a GA's ability to preferentially propagate useful genetic "building blocks". The Royal Road functions defined in [34] are more general than the ones we are considering in this paper. <p> They were thought to lay out a "royal road" for genetic algorithm search <ref> [34] </ref> and so could test a GA's ability to preferentially propagate useful genetic "building blocks".

For instance, the fitness f (s) of a string s does not in general need to be a simple sum of the fitnesses f i of the aligned blocks. <p> that essentially all bits of the founder string are stored in the population, not just the "functional" bits in the aligned block, but also the arbitrary bits this founder string happens to have in the unaligned blocks. (This kind of phenomenon has also been called "hitchhiking" in the GA literature <ref> [34] </ref>.) Thus, at an innovation, 51 more raw information is stored in the population than is necessary for improved fitness. During the epoch the unaligned blocks start to diversify again and the founder string information originally stored in these unaligned blocks is destroyed.

Reference-contexts: It is therefore logical to assume that the population in principle could become trapped in certain regions of this state space. It has become fashionable to assume that the fitness functions over the sequence spaces that occur for typical evolutionary search problems can be modeled as "rugged landscapes" <ref> [36] </ref>. These rugged landscapes have wildly fluctuating fitness values even on very small genome-variation scales and possess a large number of local fitness optima. It has been assumed that after some time, the population is likely to be found localized around some suboptimal fitness peak in the sequence space.

Their approach uses ideas from statistical mechanics to analyze the dynamics of GAs <ref> [38, 39, 40] </ref>. Their formalism also focuses on the evolution of fitness distributions, but generally only the average evolution of the first few cumulants of the fitness distribution is calculated. <p> The focus on the dynamics of fitness distributions is similar to the analysis in <ref> [38] </ref>, where the dynamics of the first few cumulants of the fitness distribution is analyzed. Here we track the dynamics of the entire fitness distribution. Equation 5.1 is analogous to a discrete-time version of the differential equations of the Eigen model of molecular evolution [11, 13].

Reference-contexts: We will make use of this type of analysis several times and will show how methods developed in the context of mathematical population genetics bear on the dynamics of GAs as well. 1.2 Organization of the Analysis Our analysis of epochal evolution in a mutation-only genetic algorithm first appeared in <ref> [44] </ref>. The present work goes into considerably more depth. Section 2 introduces the simplified GA used. In section 3 we present an overview of the wide range of different dynamical behaviors that our simple GA exhibits.

Reference-contexts: Each dimension of this space either represents a certain string <ref> [45] </ref> or the state of the population as a whole [35]. The dynamics is then described by a nonlinear matrix operator acting on this vector to produce the state at the next time step. <p> Although this "microscopic" approach is formally very clear and precise, in practice the huge sizes of these matrices make it impossible to obtain specific quantitative results. In this paper, a genetic matrix operator is constructed that is similar in spirit to the genetic operators discussed in [35] and <ref> [45] </ref> but that acts on vectors representing fitness distributions only, averaging out all other structure of the microscopic state of the population. The operator, therefore, has a much lower dimensionality. <p> This construction is similar in spirit to the generation operators in <ref> [45] </ref>, although since we focus on fitness distributions rather than entire populations, we will be able to analyze the effect of this operator explicitly and quantitatively.

Reference-contexts: The behavior of evolutionary search algorithms is often informally described as moving along a "fitness landscape" directly defined by a fitness function. It is clear from both our experiments and our analysis that this geographic metaphor, originally due to Wright <ref> [46] </ref>, can be misleading. The fitness function is only a partial determinant of the dynamics.
