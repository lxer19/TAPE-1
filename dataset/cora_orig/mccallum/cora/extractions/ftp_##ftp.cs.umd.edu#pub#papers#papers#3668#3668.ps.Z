Abstract: We address the problem of measuring the degree of hemispheric organization and asymmetry of organization in a computational model of a bihemispheric cerebral cortex. A theoretical framework for such measures is developed and used to produce algorithms for measuring the degree of organization, symmetry, and lateralization in topographic map formation. The performance of the resulting measures is tested for several topographic maps obtained by self-organization of an initially random network, and the results are compared with subjective assessments made by humans. It is found that the closest agreement with the human assessments is obtained by using organization measures based on sigmoid-type error averaging. Measures are developed which correct for large constant displacements as well as curving of the hemispheric topographic maps.

Reference-contexts: In general, one may consider as the organization measure org (M ) = f (jjM jj) (7) where f is a decreasing function transforming the range of the given disorganization measure jj jj into the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The information used in computing the disorganization measure is that which is coded in the measured hemisphere's topographic map. Recall that our working representation of the organization (or lack thereof) in our computational model of a single cerebral hemisphere's map is a 2-D matrix M . <p> We can improve the simple difference lateralization measure by applying a steepening transformation f : lat steep (org (L); org (R)) = f (org (R) org (L)) (21) 12 where f : <ref> [1; 1] </ref> ! [1; 1]; (22) is defined by f (x) = (1 + x) s + (1 x) s (23) A graph of the function f for s = 2 is shown here. <p> We can improve the simple difference lateralization measure by applying a steepening transformation f : lat steep (org (L); org (R)) = f (org (R) org (L)) (21) 12 where f : <ref> [1; 1] </ref> !

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Qualitative factors leading to topographic and computational map formation in neural networks have been studied previously [5]. Work has also been done concerning the quantitative measurement of the degree of topographic map formation <ref> [2] </ref>. We are interested in the special issues that arise in measuring hemispheric organization and lateral asymmetry of organization in computational models of topographic map development in a bihemispheric system. These issues are of concern in any study on cerebral lateralization. <p> There has been considerable research in morphometrics addressing the comparison of shapes by techniques such as Procrustean analysis <ref> [2] </ref>, and it is natural to approach the problem of comparing the organization of the two hemispheres in this way, by selecting certain "landmarks" which define corresponding map locations in the hemispheres. This approach is promising, and we will pursue it below with one small caveat.

Reference-contexts: These issues are of concern in any study on cerebral lateralization. While there has been extensive work regarding lateralization in humans <ref> [3] </ref>, the computational modelling of the development and measurement of lateralization has to our knowledge not yet been undertaken in any systematic fashion. In this report we develop a theoretical framework for the construction of such performance measures.

Reference-contexts: In this report we develop a theoretical framework for the construction of such performance measures. We show that heuristic suggestions made by others (e.g., <ref> [4] </ref> ) for the measurement of lateral asymmetry arise as special cases of our general framework, thus providing these past measures with a rigorous theoretical foundation. <p> The following version of this idea has been used before <ref> [4] </ref>: abbreviating the left and right hemispheric performances as L , R , and letting L;R measure the performance of the combined bihemispheric system, one can consider the number R L (6) to be a measure of lateralization.

It is known that lateral inhibition is necessary to allow development of structured to pographic maps <ref> [5] </ref>. In our model, all cortical afferent and intrahemispheric connections are excitatory.
