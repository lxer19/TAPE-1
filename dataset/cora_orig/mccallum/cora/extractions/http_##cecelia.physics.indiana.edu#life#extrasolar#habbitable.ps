Reference-contexts: There are naturally ambitious projects to detect Earth-like inner planets with these methods (see for instance <ref> [1] </ref> and the "TOPS report" [34]), but they have no chance to become operational before at least a couple of decades.

Reference-contexts: An autocorrelation study of the star light curve could reveal this echo <ref> [3] </ref>. 3) If the orbital plane of the planet is correctly oriented, it produces a drop in the star light during transits (duration D occ 1-20hrs); for a random orientation of the planet orbital plane, the geometric probability of the transit is p = R ? =a for a single star; <p> M sini, a chromospheric activity ? [36] A more exotic possibility is to search for the echo of the flares of a star on a nearby planet; this echo will have a delay proportionnal to a and an amplitude inversely proportional to a 2 ; thus, as shown by Argyle <ref> [3] </ref> and Bromley [7], this method can work only for very inner planets of Jupiter size, which, according to section 2.1, is a contradictory requirement. As for the methods valid for all planets, the most efficient is the timing method.

Reference-contexts: There are two type of projects. In the space projects the aim is to monitor photometrically thousands of G-stars to search for inner planets; see the contribution of B. Borucki, D. Koch et al. in the same volume <ref> [4] </ref>. From the ground it is possible to detect all kinds of planets, but, because the photometric precision is then only 10 3 , only in dM stars [31]. <p> Table 4. Future projects. Method Group Descript.

Reference-contexts: the occultation curve: there is not only a double occulation [30], but it consists of a longer and a shorter occultation since the motion of the planet is in the same direction as the star for one of the components and in the opposite direction for the other one [30], <ref> [6] </ref>; in addition the ephemerides of the second occultation can be predicted with precision from the first one since the orbital motion of the binary is completely known.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, while a terrestrial planet gives only a reflex velocity of 0.1 m/s for a solar-type star, this velocity is 0.5 m/s for an habitable planet orbiting a dM star; with a precision of 1 m/s as it is envisaged today on a m V = 3 star <ref> [10] </ref>, it is not hopeless to detect Earth-like planets for these stars with a 10-m class telescope. Let me remark that for dM stars terrestrial planets have orbital periods of the order of weeks and not of years as for Jupiters around suns; this should render the detection easier.

The method finds some improvements when the target star is an eclipsing binary. There are then several favourable characteristics: the main advantage is that the chances for correct orientation of the planet orbit are close to 100% [30].

Huang has shown that a planetary body must be larger than the Moon to be habitable <ref> [18] </ref>. Until now only moderate efforts have been made in the search for habitable planets.

Reference-contexts: As for the habitability of planets around dM stars, it has first been argued that the tidal locking of the planet (which is very close to 2 a sep being the separation of the binary 5 the star) forbidds the presence of liquid water <ref> [20] </ref>. But more recently it has been shown that 3-D atmospheric circulation may prevent the water evaporation [13], [16], [17].

It is not clear whether or not the presence of life is incompatible with a large radio emission of the planet. Most of the observable quantities just mentioned are modulated by a phase factor (t) with a period P due to the orbital revolution of the planet.

Reference-contexts: This makes a double occultation difficult to be confused with any artefact. 3.1.2 Other methods The Table 4 does not include the timing searches because there is no timing program specifically aimed for planet detection. Almost every timing campaign on pulsars has the potential to detect planets; see <ref> [29] </ref> for a review. On the other hand I should also mention the spectroscopic search, although no group has specific plans to search for terrestrial planets with this method.

Reference-contexts: In fact the question of their existence has recently taken a very great importance: in a spectroscopic search of extrasolar planets around 21 solar type stars, no single star has been found to have a Jupiter-like companion <ref> [35] </ref>. This result immediatly leads to a further question: do planetary systems be rare or are they on the contrary common but with no Jupiters? This question is directly related to the present subject since, as will be recalled in section 2, the habitable planets cannot be Jupiters.
