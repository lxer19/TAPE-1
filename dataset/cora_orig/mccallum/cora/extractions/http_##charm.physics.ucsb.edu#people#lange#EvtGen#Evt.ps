Title: V00-07-51 EvtGen A Monte Carlo generator for B-physics  
Author: Anders Ryd David Lange Natalia Kuznetsova Sophie Versille Marcello Rotondo Alain Bellerive Veronique Boisvert 
Date: November 6, 1998  
Abstract: This note describes EvtGen, an event generator that is well suited for B physics. It implements many detailed models that are important for the physics of B mesons. In particular, it has detailed models for semileptonic decays, CP violating decays and produces correct results for the angular distributions in sequential decays, including all correlations. It also has an interface to JetSet for generation of continuum at the (4S) and for generic hadronic decays, e.g. of Bs, that are not implemented in the generator.

Reference-contexts: Several Breit-Wigners descriptions are available. By default, the generator is initialized with relativistic Breit-Wigners according to the Kuhn-Santamaria model where the parameters have been fitted by Aleph with e + e and t + t data <ref> [4] </ref>. It uses a pole-compensation method to generate the events efficiently by taking into account the poles due to the Breit-Wigners of the 's [5]. The generator returns the amplitudes for B 0 ! 3, and B 0 ! 3 for the kinematics of the generated final state.

The last six arguments are G 1+ , G 0+ , and G 1 , and are expressed as their absolute values and phases again the definition of these parameters are in Ref.
