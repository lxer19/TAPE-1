Title: A System Architecture for Spoken Utterance Production in Collaborative Dialogue

Abstract: This paper presents a system architecture for producing spoken utterances while collaborating with the human dialogue partner in carrying on a spoken dialogue. The system incrementally produces utterances while managing the responses and interruptions from the human dialogue partner that occur in the middle of the system's utterances. The collaborative principles that the system must use in order to collaborate on a spoken dialogue with the human partner are described. These principles are based on the results of an analysis of the nature and interdependence of utterance units, responses from dialogue partners, and discourse strategies for handling responses in a corpus of spoken dialogues. In particular, it is shown that there are cases where the system has to suspend utterances planned in advance and plan additional utterances to maintain the mutual understanding of exchanges even when the partner does not make any responses. The system has been implemented and the effects of the principles and system architecture have been evaluated in dialogue simulation experiments.

Reference-contexts: Our system can be regarded as a spoken dialogue system although we are mainly concerned with spoken language generation. Allen et al. have presented a spoken dialogue system and showed that human users can use it successfully <ref> [ Allen et al., 1996 ] </ref> , but the principles by which utterances are incrementally produced while handling responses were not described. 3 Corpus Analysis for Collaborative Principles 3.1 Utterance units We used the same corpus as Dohsaka et al.

Reference-contexts: Previous research on generation systems that can manage the interactions with the dialogue partner <ref> [ Cawsey, 1991; Moore and Paris, 1993 ] </ref> is important in that it has established basic techniques for planning written discourse while handling the interactions, but those techniques are insufficient for handling responses in spoken dialogue because of the unique nature of spoken interaction.

Reference-contexts: By handling the responses and interruptions in a timely and context-relevant manner, the system maintains the mutual understanding of exchanges in dialogue. This is the fundamental collaborative task in which the system must be engaged <ref> [ Clark and Schaefer, 1989 ] </ref> . To design such a system, the characteristic nature of spoken interaction must be accounted for. Collaborative principles that the system must obey to participate in spoken dialogues are required.

Reference-contexts: The excessively long pauses in mid-utterance are regarded as out of line with the social code of communication, and the incremental transmission of information enables the system to handle the partner's responses in a timely manner. Computational models for incremental generation that focus on sentence formulation <ref> [ Kempen and Hoenkamp, 1987; De Smedt and Kempen, 1991 ] </ref> and the generation of written discourse [ Reithinger, 1991 ] have been proposed.

Reference-contexts: In particular, this paper is concerned with collaborative prin ciples that spoken utterance production systems must obey to collaborate on a dialogue with the human user. The structure of spoken discourse has distinctive features. For example, utterance units are smaller than sentences in written discourse <ref> [ Levelt, 1989; Halliday, 1994; Dohsaka and Shimazu, 1996 ] </ref> . These small utterance units are hierarchically related to each other by the discourse relations that serve for the incremental transmission of information [ Dohsaka and Shimazu, 1996 ] , and the dialogue partner responds to these small units. <p> For example, utterance units are smaller than sentences in written discourse [ Levelt, 1989; Halliday, 1994; Dohsaka and Shimazu, 1996 ] . These small utterance units are hierarchically related to each other by the discourse relations that serve for the incremental transmission of information <ref> [ Dohsaka and Shimazu, 1996 ] </ref> , and the dialogue partner responds to these small units. This characteristic discourse structure must be thus allowed for in order to design a spoken utterance production system that can collaborate on a dialogue with the human dialogue partner. <p> These models do not sufficiently account for the characteristic structure of spoken discourse, and although a computational model for producing utterances incrementally based on the characteristic structure of spoken discourse has been presented <ref> [ Dohsaka and Shimazu, 1996 ] </ref> , it does not handle responses from the human partner. <p> system and showed that human users can use it successfully [ Allen et al., 1996 ] , but the principles by which utterances are incrementally produced while handling responses were not described. 3 Corpus Analysis for Collaborative Principles 3.1 Utterance units We used the same corpus as Dohsaka et al. <ref> [ Dohsaka and Shimazu, 1996 ] </ref> , which consists of eighty dialogues collected from ninety native Japanese. In each dialogue, two subjects N and E were asked to converse by telephone concerning how N could go from one place to another. <p> According to the utterance plan, the utterance controller sends linguistic expressions to the speech synthesizer. By elaborating domain plans and utterance plans in a stepwise manner using the hierarchical planning mechanism [ Russel and Norvig, 1995, Chap. 12 ] , this system can produce utterances incrementally under time constraints <ref> [ Dohsaka and Shimazu, 1996 ] </ref> . The speech recognizer translates the partner's speech into linguistic expressions, which the response analyzer classifies as interjectory words, repetitions of the sys-tem's utterance, interrogative utterances for confirmation, and so on. <p> Such an utterance plan is decomposed into a sequence of surface communicative actions, each of which corresponds to the uttering of linguistic expressions. The planning mechanism is the same as that in the previous system <ref> [ Dohsaka and Shimazu, 1996 ] </ref> . After executing surface communicative actions comprising an utterance unit, the utterance controller makes a pause or produces a filler term so that the partner can recognize the end of the unit. <p> Each unit has no more than one nongiven NP. Unit (4) is related to both (5) and (6) by a Circumstance relation [ Mann and Thompson, 1988 ] . This kind of discourse structure prevails in spoken discourse <ref> [ Dohsaka and Shimazu, 1996 ] </ref> . By holding to the principles (p1), (p2) and (p3), the system can produce utterances in the way that individual nongiven NPs are introduced by separate units.

Reference-contexts: The collaborative principles and dialogue model are utilized to make utterances relevant and to handle responses in a timely and context-relevant manner. This system uses, in addition to the principles based on the corpus analysis, some Gricean principles such as the principle that objects in the focus of attention <ref> [ Grosz and Sidner, 1986 ] </ref> are pronominalized as in the previous system. The dialogue model records the discourse structure in which utterances are related to each other by discourse relations [ Mann and Thompson, 1988 ] and tracks the focus of attention.

Reference-contexts: We ignored cases where P 2 continued utterances in control of the dialogue after the response, since this analysis was concerned with how P 1 developed the discourse while managing responses from P 2 . According to the discourse relation <ref> [ Mann and Thompson, 1988 ] </ref> holding between U and the subsequent discourse, the ways that the subsequent discourse unfolds fall into three categories: Extend: The subsequent discourse to describe the nucleus of U starts. Refine: The subsequent discourse to elaborate on U or describe the satellite of U starts. <p> The dialogue model records the discourse structure in which utterances are related to each other by discourse relations <ref> [ Mann and Thompson, 1988 ] </ref> and tracks the focus of attention. It also records what kinds of responses have been made to each of the utterance units. <p> Although merging units (5) and (6) does not violate principle (p1), the separation of these units simplifies the syntactic formulation of each action. Each unit has no more than one nongiven NP. Unit (4) is related to both (5) and (6) by a Circumstance relation <ref> [ Mann and Thompson, 1988 ] </ref> .
