Abstract: This paper describes a novel approach for incorporating the components characterized by the measured scattering-parameter (S-parameter) data into an S-parameter macro-model based simulator. This approach first converts the measured S-parameter data into frequency-dependent parasitic functions: R(f), L(f), C(f), and G(f), which are later used to compute the moments of the S-parameter for the construction of the macromodel. Benefiting from the weak frequency dependency nature of the R(f ), L(f ), C(f ), and G(f ) functions, this method allows the moments to be calculated in a much more accurate fashion than those obtained from fitting the S-parameter directly. This method also has several added advantages such as: the moments produced are independent of the approximation order and insensitive to measurement errors, furthermore, they observe power conservation rule for passive systems. The simulation results show very good agreements with the results produced by the direct convolution approach.
