Abstract: Parts contacts and parts handling at the micro scale pose new challenges to roboticists: With decreasing scale, forces proportional to the volume of objects (such as weight or inertia) decrease in comparison to surface forces (such as friction and sticking forces). We briefly describe these forces and discuss their effects on micro parts handling. Then we give an overview of our work on micro manipulation strategies. We describe how arrays of MEMS devices can move and position tiny parts, such as integrated circuit chips, in flexible and predictable ways by oscillatory or ciliary action. The theory of programmable force fields can model the contacts between parts and large numbers of microscopic actuators, leading to algorithms for various types of micromanipulation that require no sensing of where the part is. Experiments support the theory.

Reference-contexts: Does there exist a universal field that, for every part P , has only one unique equilibrium (up to part symmetry)? Such a field could be used to build a universal parts feeder <ref> [1] </ref> that uniquely positions a part without the need of a clock, sensors, or programming. <p> This device design is inspired by the "universal gripper" in <ref> [1] </ref>. Such a field could be obtained from a MEMS array that implements a unit radial force field. Instead of rectangular actuators in a regular grid, triangular actuators could be laid out in a polar-coordinate grid. The array could then be tilted slightly to obtain the gravity component.

P is in orientational equilibrium if the moments acting on P are balanced. Total equilibrium is simultaneous translational and orientational equilibrium. Claim 3 <ref> [21] </ref> Every squeeze field f (see Defini tion 6.1) has potential, of the form U (z) = Z f ds, where ff is an arbitrary path to z from a fixed reference point. <p> If d z denotes the perpendicular distance of z from the squeeze line, then U (d z ) = jd z j. Claim 4 <ref> [21] </ref> Let P be a connected polygonal part with finite contact area and n vertices.

For polygonal parts there exist analytical methods to compute the equilibria exactly (see <ref> [21] </ref> for a detailed algorithm and a derivation of the O (kn 2 ) bound). Claim 5 [21] Let P be a polygon whose interior is connected. There exists a sensorless alignment strategy consisting of a sequence of squeeze fields that uniquely orients P up to symmetries. <p> For polygonal parts there exist analytical methods to compute the equilibria exactly (see <ref> [21] </ref> for a detailed algorithm and a derivation of the O (kn 2 ) bound). Claim 5 [21] Let P be a polygon whose interior is connected. There exists a sensorless alignment strategy consisting of a sequence of squeeze fields that uniquely orients P up to symmetries. <p> The output of this algorithm is a sequence of squeeze directions. When the corresponding squeeze fields are applied to the part P , the set of possible orientations is successively reduced until a unique orientation (up to symmetry) is reached. For details see <ref> [21] </ref> and [39]. 2 Task: Orienting and Aligning Parts If a part is placed in a squeeze field, it will translate and rotate until a stable equilibrium is reached (Claim 4). Parts may exhibit several equilibria, hence after one squeeze the part orientation may be ambiguous. <p> The square with center on the squeeze line will rotate indefinitely. Moreover, it has no stable equilibrium in this field. 6.2 Skewed Squeeze Fields Definition 6 <ref> [21] </ref> A skewed field f S is a vector field given by f S (x; y) = sign (x)(1; *), where 0 6= * 2 R.

In a skewed squeeze field, it is easy to find a circular path along which the work integral is non-zero (e.g., along a circle with center on the squeeze line). Claim 8 [21] A skewed field induces no stable equilibrium on a disk-shaped part (for all * 6= 0). Force equilibrium is only possible if the center of the disk coincides with the squeeze line. In this position the disk experiences a non-zero moment if * 6= 0. <p> In this position the disk experiences a non-zero moment if * 6= 0. Claim 9 A diagonally skewed field (* = 1) induces no stable equilibrium on a square-shaped part. For a proof see <ref> [21] </ref>. Task: Rotating Parts According to Claims 8 and 9, certain parts will rotate indefinitely in skewed squeeze fields (Figure 18). <p> During the experiments of approximately 10 min, several full rotations of the part were performed. 6.3 Radial Fields Definition 10 A radial field f is a two-dimensional force vector field such that f (z) = z=jzj if z 6= 0, and f (0) = 0. Claim 11 <ref> [21] </ref> A radial field has a potential, U (z) = jzj. Claim 12 [21] Given a polygonal part P in a radial field f , there exists a unique pivot point v of P such that P is in equilibrium if and only if v coincides with the center of the <p> Claim 11 <ref> [21] </ref> A radial field has a potential, U (z) = jzj. Claim 12 [21] Given a polygonal part P in a radial field f , there exists a unique pivot point v of P such that P is in equilibrium if and only if v coincides with the center of the radial field. Claim 13 [21] Let P be a polygonal part with n <p> Claim 12 <ref> [21] </ref> Given a polygonal part P in a radial field f , there exists a unique pivot point v of P such that P is in equilibrium if and only if v coincides with the center of the radial field. Claim 13 [21] Let P be a polygonal part with n vertices, and let k be the maximum number of edges that a bisector of P can cross. <p> There are at most E = O (kn) stable equilibria in a field of the form R + ffiS if S is a squeeze field, and ffi is sufficiently small and positive. Proofs of the previous claims, and a numerical algorithm to compute the pivot point is given in <ref> [21] </ref>. Note that Claim 13 results in strategies for unique part posing in O (E 2 ) = O (k 2 n 2 ) steps. Task: Centering Parts Radial fields can be used to center a part. <p> More complex tasks such as centering or unique orienting require increasingly complex fields. However, planning complexity is e.g. higher for sequences of squeeze fields, and lower for the more complex combined radial + squeeze fields (for a thorough discussion of these fields see <ref> [21] </ref>). This illustrates a tradeoff between mechanical complexity (the dexterity and controllability of actuator arrray elements) and computational complexity (the algorithmic difficulty of synthesizing a strategy).

Reference-contexts: Models based on classical mechanics and geometry are often used to describe small and micro scale robotics. However, there are severe limitations to this approach. Due to scaling effects, forces that are insignificant at the macro scale become dominant at the micro scale (and vice versa) <ref> [35, 76] </ref>. For example, when parts to be handled are less than one millimeter in size, adhesive forces between gripper and object can be significant compared to gravitational forces. <p> In the remainder of this section we give a brief summary of the surface sticking forces that become significant at the micro scale. This section draws heavily on results derived by Ron Fearing in his 1995 IROS paper <ref> [35] </ref>, where these issues are discussed in much more detail. 3.1 Adhesion Forces The adhesion of particles to substrates has received substantial study for problems such as particulate contamination in semiconductor manufacturing [51, 82, 29, 40, 42]. <p> However, good insulators can store charge densities that are several orders of magnitude higher. The van der Waals force for a sphere and plane is given approximately by [29] as: F vdw = 8z 2 (2) surface tension forces. Attractive force between a sphere and a plane. (Reprinted from <ref> [35] </ref>. c fl 1995 IEEE.) where h is the Lifshitz-van der Waals constant, and z is the atomic separation between the surfaces. This formula is assuming atomically smooth surfaces; severe corrections need to be made for rough surfaces as the van der Waals forces fall off very rapidly with distance. <p> As we have seen, electrostatic, van der Waals, and surface tension forces can be significant compared to the weight of small parts. In <ref> [35] </ref>, Fearing makes the following suggestions to improve the performace of mi-crorobots by reducing adhesion between microgrippers and parts: 1. Minimize contact electrification by using materials with a small contact potential difference for the gripper and object. 2. Use conductive materials which don't easily form highly insulating native oxides. 3.

However, the fabrication, control, and programming of micro-devices that can interact and actively change their environment remains challenging. <p> In particular, the rotation algorithm resulting from the application of skew-symmetric squeeze fields is considerably simpler than rotation algorithms proposed in the MEMS literature (for example, the vortices suggested by Fujita <ref> [37] </ref> or by Liu and Will [53]). Vortices require at least four areas of the array to be pushing in different directions. That is, vortices can be implemented using four triangular or rectangular regions, upon each of which the vector field is constant.

Reference-contexts: a summary of control strategies, and gives an outlook on open problems. parts of different sizes are first centered and subsequently separated depending on their size. 2 Research Growth A wide variety of MEMS devices has been built recently by using processing techniques known from VLSI industry (see for example <ref> [38, 59, 57, 58] </ref>). A multitude of microsensors and microactuators have been shown to perform successfully.

Reference-contexts: We define the squeeze function as this mapping from original orientation to equilibrium orientation. Hence, from Claim 4 it follows that the image of the squeeze function is a set of E discrete values. Given such a squeeze function, Goldberg has presented an algorithm for sensorless manipulation of polygons <ref> [39] </ref> that constructs an orienting strategy with O (E) steps in O (E 2 ) time. The output of this algorithm is a sequence of squeeze directions. <p> The output of this algorithm is a sequence of squeeze directions. When the corresponding squeeze fields are applied to the part P , the set of possible orientations is successively reduced until a unique orientation (up to symmetry) is reached. For details see [21] and <ref> [39] </ref>. 2 Task: Orienting and Aligning Parts If a part is placed in a squeeze field, it will translate and rotate until a stable equilibrium is reached (Claim 4). Parts may exhibit several equilibria, hence after one squeeze the part orientation may be ambiguous.

Reference-contexts: These adhesive forces arise primarily from surface tension, van der Waals, and electrostatic attractions and can be a fundamental limitation to part handling. While it is possible to fabricate miniature versions of conventional robot grippers (for example the polysilicon gripper in Figure 4 <ref> [46] </ref>, or [63]), overcoming adhesion effects for the smallest parts will be difficult. In the remainder of this section we give a brief summary of the surface sticking forces that become significant at the micro scale.

However, the fabrication, control, and programming of micro-devices that can interact and actively change their environment remains challenging. <p> In particular, the rotation algorithm resulting from the application of skew-symmetric squeeze fields is considerably simpler than rotation algorithms proposed in the MEMS literature (for example, the vortices suggested by Fujita [37] or by Liu and Will <ref> [53] </ref>). Vortices require at least four areas of the array to be pushing in different directions. That is, vortices can be implemented using four triangular or rectangular regions, upon each of which the vector field is constant. Skewed fields perform the same task with only two regions of constant force.
