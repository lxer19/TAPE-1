Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the problem of obstacle avoidance in an Automated Highway System (AHS). For a given scenario (traffic state, obstacle location, etc.), we synthesize the best possible avoidance maneuver for each vehicle. Our aim is to obtain a distributed strategy so that the obstacle avoidance maneuvers can be executed by vehicle based controllers (with some inter-vehicle communication) as opposed to a roadside controller making decisions and communicating it to the individual vehicles.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We are interested in the design of emergency maneuvers for fully automated vehicles in an Automated Highway System (AHS). Emergencies arise in an AHS primarily due to faults and system intrusions. The management of AHS malfunctions is extensively discussed in <ref> [1] </ref> and [2]. The management of system intrusions has received less attention. An important class of system intrusions is represented by obstacles on the AHS roadway and it is desirable that the automated vehicles have obstacle avoidance capabilties.

Reference-contexts: If a vehicle can estimate its deceleration capability then the estimation of stopping distance is a simple kinematic problem. We will not concern ourselves here any further with the estimation of stopping distance. For deceleration capability estimation refer <ref> [3] </ref>. In the rest of this paper we will address the problem of estimating the distance or time required for normal and emergency lane changes.

Reference-contexts: The concatenated trajectory, though hopefully efficient, is not necessarily optimal in the set of all possible concatenated trajectories. 1.2 Literature Review The obstacle avoidance problem has been studied in the literature. We present a brief review in this section. Optimal lane change maneuver trajectories are designed in <ref> [4] </ref> for lane changes onto a shoulder. A bicycle model of the car with independent constraints on lateral and longitudinal acceleration is used to calculate emergency lane change trajectories for obstacle p. 2 avoiadance.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we consider the more general problem of designing trajectories for obstacle avoidance in traffic, albeit with a simpler vehicle model. In <ref> [5] </ref>, a simplified point mass model is used to classify crashes arising due to unsafe, uncoordinated lane changes. The classification is then used to provide insight into the design of collision avoidance and driver warning systems for partially automated driving applications.

Reference-contexts: For the dynamical system described by equation 1, it is shown in <ref> [7] </ref>, that the worst disturbance generated by the vehicle in front is the application of its brakes as hard as possible until it comes to rest, to which the best control response of the following vehicle is to apply its brakes as soon and as hard as possible until it too <p> We refer to this notion of safety as hard braking safety. These observations, proven in <ref> [7] </ref>, provide a set of necessary and sufficient conditions that can be used to define the safe set. Another way of defining the safe set is given in [8]. This derivation assumes the same braking and acceleration abilities for both vehicles. We believe this is unduly restrictive though considerably simpler.

The trajectory condition (equation (11)) is reduced to a condition on the initial state of the trajectory by observing that the trajectory as a whole is non-negative iff its minima are non-negative.
