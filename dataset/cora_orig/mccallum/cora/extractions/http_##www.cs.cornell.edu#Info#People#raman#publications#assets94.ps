Abstract: Communicating technical material orally is often hindered by the relentless linearity of audio; information flows actively past a passive listener. This is in stark contrast to communication through the printed medium, where we can actively peruse the visual display to access relevant information. A S T E R is an interactive computing system for audio formatting electronic documents (presently, documents written in (L A )T E X) to produce audio documents. A S T E R can speak both literary texts and highly technical documents that contain complex mathematics. In fact, the effective speaking and interactive browsing of mathematics is a key goal of A S T E R. To this end, a listener can browse both complete documents and complex mathematical expressions. A S T E R thus enables active listening. This paper describes the browsing component of A S T E R. The design and implementation of A S T E R is beyond the scope of this paper. Here, we will focus on the browser, and refer to other parts of the system in passing for the sake of completeness. Keywords

Reference-contexts: Such information is exploited in giving contextual information about the current selection. Traversing the structure of mathematical expressions is particularly useful when used in conjunction with the variable-substitution 3 rendering style |described in <ref> [9, 7] </ref>. In fact, such traversal can be thought of as a dual to variable substitution. If an expression has been rendered once using variable substitution, then future traversals of that expression use the variable names generated in the substitution process when cueing the current selection.

Reference-contexts: Hence, we need to enable active listening, i.e., enable the listener to determine what is heard. To be effective, audio renderings need to be interactive. Our browser allows a user to interactively traverse the internal high-level representation of a document (described in <ref> [8, 10, 9] </ref>) and listen to portions of interest. The browser provides basic tree-traversal commands that can be composed to effectively browse the information structure. The browser is characterized by its simple command set; commands are of the form &lt;verb&gt; rather than the more complex &lt;verb&gt; + &lt;noun&gt;.

Renderings of cross-reference tags are customizable by providing methods on generic function read-cross-reference ; see <ref> [9] </ref> for examples. 4 Emacs terminology for C-u as a prefix to the command. Cross-referenceable objects Technical documents use cross references to numbered equations and theorems to make the presentation succinct. Cross references in the running text typically use a system-generated number, e.g., equation 3:2:1.
