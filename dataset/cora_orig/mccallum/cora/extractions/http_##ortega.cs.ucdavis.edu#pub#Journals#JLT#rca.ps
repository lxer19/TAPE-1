Reference-contexts: WDM lightwave networks can be classified into two categories: multihop [20] versus single-hop [19]. In multihop networks <ref> [1] </ref>, each node needs to access only a small fraction of the total number of channels and packets may hop through several intermediate nodes before reaching their destinations. Multihop networks can be constructed by employing a few fixed transmitters and receivers (transceivers) or slowly tunable transceivers at each node.

Reference-contexts: This requires that any pair of nodes should have access to at least one common channel. Since it is infeasible to have separate transmitters and receivers for different wavelengths at all nodes, tunable transmitters and/or tunable receivers are the key components in this category of networks <ref> [2] </ref>. The fundamental issue here is how to design efficient multiple access protocols to coordinate data transmissions on multiple channels. <p> Hence, it is infeasible to ignore the propagation delay under this environment. Also, currently available tunable transceivers have tuning time in the range of submilliseconds in order to have a wide range of tunable wavelengths <ref> [2] </ref>. That is, the tuning time may be comparable to the data packet transmission time and, hence, it cannot be ignored. Table 2. Features of the RCA protocol. 1. Employs simple NIU structure (CC-TTTR) 2.

Also, they all ignore the effect of tuning time and propagation delay. Without a separate control channel for pre-transmission coordination, some form of preallocation mechanism is usually needed. As a result, some of the systems are difficult to scale.

Reference-contexts: Although each wavelength may have a relatively lower bandwidth (with its speed compatible to a node's interface), it is expected that by employing new network architectures and parallel access methods the overall system capacity can be much higher than that achievable with only a single high-bandwidth channel <ref> [10] </ref> [19] [21]. WDM lightwave networks can be classified into two categories: multihop [20] versus single-hop [19]. In multihop networks [1], each node needs to access only a small fraction of the total number of channels and packets may hop through several intermediate nodes before reaching their destinations.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the round-trip propagation delay between any two nodes is R control slots and is assumed to be the same for all the nodes (extension of the protocol to incorporate nonuniform distances is proposed in <ref> [14] </ref>). Transceivers' tuning time is T control slots. 6 2.1 Data Structures At each node in the network, the following data structures are maintained to support the RCA protocol. (1) Reception Scheduling Queue (RSQ). RSQ is used by a node to schedule incoming data packet reception. <p> The accuracy of this assumption will be verified via simulation. The uniform distances assumption (A5) is employed 12 to simplify the analysis, although the RCA protocol has been extended to incorporate nonuniform distances <ref> [14] </ref>. <p> We have applied the EPA technique to analyze the Markov model of the protocol and our results can help the system designer in choosing the proper system parameters. The extension of the RCA protocol to operate under nonuniform distances was presented in <ref> [14] </ref>. A limitation of the RCA protocol, as with other random access protocols, is that the packet delay can fluctuate over a relatively wide range under heavy loading, which makes it unsuitable for real time traffic. Work in this area is under progress.

This is because the system is bistable when it is overloaded, similar to other slotted ALOHA systems analyzed in <ref> [16] </ref>. A bistable system has two equilibrium (i.e., stable) points with the same system throughput. Each equilibrium point in our system is independently obtained with the EPA analysis which assumes a unique equilibrium point. Therefore, the simulation point is between the two equilibrium points obtained with the EPA analysis.

Section 2 contains a detailed description of the RCA protocol and establishes several of the protocol's important properties. <p> Due to the nonzero channel propagation delay, dynamic channel allocation as in the Aloha/N-Server scheme [18] is infeasible. Without separate transceivers for the control channel, no global information can be maintained and reservation-based assignments such as those in [3] [13] <ref> [17] </ref> cannot be applied here. Hence, we propose a deterministic data channel assignment to avoid data channel collisions while keeping the protocol simple. Let the W data channels be numbered 1 ; 2 ; :::; W .

Several protocols were discussed in [11] <ref> [18] </ref> [23] which employ slotted ALOHA to access the control channel. However, they all have an inherent problem of receiver collisions which cannot be ignored when the number of nodes in the network is finite, as analyzed in [15]. <p> We refer to this situation as receiver collision on data packet. In addition to the problem of receiver collisions, all the schemes in [11] <ref> [18] </ref> [23] assume zero transceiver tuning time and zero channel propagation delay, and have low system throughput. <p> Our proposed Receiver Collision Avoidance (RCA) protocol is designed to resolve the receiver collision problem, introduce more practical assumptions on tuning time and propagation delay, and achieve higher system throughput with moderate protocol processing time, while retaining the simple NIU 4 structure and the flexibility of the schemes in [11] <ref> [18] </ref> [23]. <p> We recognize that a receiver collision can cause unreliable communication since, after transmitting a packet, the source node has no idea whether the packet is indeed received by the destination node or not. If high-level protocols are involved to solve the problem, as suggested in <ref> [18] </ref>, some form of acknowledgement or time-out mechanism needs to be employed and the system overhead can be greatly increased. We consider it more efficient to deal with this problem at the medium access level, thereby releasing this burden from high-level protocols. <p> The problem is solved in the RCA protocol with a simple receiver collision detection and avoidance mechanism. Moreover, the RCA protocol takes into account nonzero channel propagation delay and nonzero transceiver tuning time which have been ignored in many previous work [11] <ref> [18] </ref> [23]. In a high speed network such as WDM lightwave network, the ratio of channel propagation delay over packet transmission time is much larger than unity. Hence, it is infeasible to ignore the propagation delay under this environment. <p> A proper data channel assignment is introduced in the RCA protocol to prevent collisions on data channels. All these features of the RCA protocol do not come without a price. The amount of protocol processing time is higher compared with those of previous schemes in [11] <ref> [18] </ref> [23], but is moderate when compared with those of global reservation schemes [3] [4] [5] [12] [13] [17]. <p> A simple way to achieve this is via random channel selection which was used in <ref> [18] </ref>, but system throughput is significantly degraded as a result of collisions on the data channels. Due to the nonzero channel propagation delay, dynamic channel allocation as in the Aloha/N-Server scheme [18] is infeasible. <p> A simple way to achieve this is via random channel selection which was used in <ref> [18] </ref>, but system throughput is significantly degraded as a result of collisions on the data channels.

Without separate transceivers for the control channel, no global information can be maintained and reservation-based assignments such as those in [3] [13] [17] cannot be applied here. Hence, we propose a deterministic data channel assignment to avoid data channel collisions while keeping the protocol simple. <p> Under the special case when M=W, the system bandwidth is considered enormous, and the efficient utilization of the bandwidth may not be an important issue. Note that the same overlapping mechanism could have been incorporated into Mehravari's protocol <ref> [18] </ref>, but the RCA protocol also achieves some additional features. (1) It takes into account the channel propagation delay, which makes it more practical. (2) It efficiently resolves the receiver collision problem (to be described later). (3) It has higher system throughput. 2.4 Packet Transmission To describe the packet transmission procedure, <p> To conduct a meaningful performance comparison, we select several typical schemes with the same CC-TTTR structure as in the RCA protocol, and list their total system capacities in Table 3. The results from the schemes in <ref> [18] </ref> [23] were obtained with an infinite user population model. For the RCA protocol, we choose two large population cases: M=100 and M=500. From Table 3, we can see that the RCA protocol has higher system capacity under all values of data packet length and number of data channels. <p> This is because the probability of receiver collision is lower with a larger number of nodes for a given value of W.

After the maximum throughput is reached, the system became unstable, i.e., multiple solutions to the EPA equations were found, similar to the results obtained and explained in <ref> [25] </ref>. In Fig. 10, we show the system performance with different values of W. When the length of a data slot is fixed, increasing W has the effect of reducing the length of a control slot, which is equal to L=W minislots.
