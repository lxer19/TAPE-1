Abstract: We introduce a method for unsupervised clustering of images of 3D objects. Our method examines the space of all images and partitions the images into sets that form smooth and parallel surfaces in this space. It further uses sequences of images to obtain more reliable clustering. Finally, since our method relies on a non-Euclidean similarity measure we introduce algebraic techniques to estimating local properties of these surfaces without first embedding the images in a Eu-clidean space. We demonstrate our method by applying it to a large database of images.

Reference-contexts: than the dimension of the space [9, 14, 19, 21, 24, 29], but it may be arbitrary, due to changes in lighting, viewpoint, articulation, etc., and may even vary at different places. (In fact, the set of images may even have volume in space due, e.g., to lighting variations, see <ref> [1] </ref>). In addition, the surface may self intersect, e.g., due to symmetries of the object. In general, we may expect the surfaces produced by the set of images of objects to typically be continuous and slowly curving.

Reference-contexts: These include methods that extract global features of the objects and clus ter the images according to these features [16, 7]. A second family of methods relies on the part structure of objects for categorization <ref> [5, 4, 18, 6, 20, 27, 10] </ref>. The underlying assumption of these methods is that objects that belong to the same perceptual category maintain roughly the same set of parts. Finally, there are methods which seek to interpret the perceived shapes in terms of their function [33, 13, 22, 28]. <p> Many subjective contours are easier to perceive when curve fragments are available (as opposed to only a sparse set of points), in particular when the available fragments include the corners and high curvature sections of the boundaries of shapes <ref> [4] </ref>. Based on these observations we propose the following algorithm for image clustering. Given a set of images or sequences of images we first compute the similarities between all pairs of input images.

Reference-contexts: It is interesting to note that the use of invariance is not only questioned in the context of object categorization from images, but also that there is an ongoing debate in the psychology literature to whether perceptual categories are characterized by invariant properties (see <ref> [17] </ref>). The difficulty in using invariance leads us to seek other mechanisms for categorization.

Reference-contexts: A common method to overcome this problem is to use multidimensional scaling (MDS) to first embed the images in a Euclidean space in a way that minimizes the necessary distortion of the distances <ref> [25] </ref>. MDS, however, is an iterative optimization process that often converges to a local minimum, and so it may be slow and unreliable.

Reference-contexts: At this point we treat the problem as a standard graph clustering problem. In our experiments we used a recursive application of a normalized cut algorithm (as used in <ref> [26] </ref>) to partition the graph. This produces a binary tree in which the hierarchy of the clustering is reflected in the levels of the tree. 5 Experiments In this section we describe the experiments conducted to validate our method.
