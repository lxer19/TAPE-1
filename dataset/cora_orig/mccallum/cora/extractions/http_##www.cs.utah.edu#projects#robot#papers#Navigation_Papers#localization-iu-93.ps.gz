Abstract: Localization based on visual landmarks requires feature extraction from views and map, matching of features between views and map, and viewpoint hypothesis generation and verification. In this paper, we describe lower-level image and map understanding procedures for extracting features and higher-level problem solving methods for establishing feature correspondences and making inferences about the viewpoint. Each of these processes, including the interaction of high-level and low-level subsystems, is demonstrated on real data.

Reference-contexts: It works best when the uncertainty in the viewpoint is small and when it is relatively easy to accurately generate expected sensor data. For example, in the TERCOM and SITAN cruise missile guidance systems, a digital elevation model is matched against a downward looking, radar sensed elevation profile <ref> [ An-dreas et al., 1978, Baird and Abramson, 1984 ] </ref> . Several researchers have addressed the more difficult problem of signal-based localization at or near ground level using horizontally oriented imaging systems and passive sensing.

Reference-contexts: With signal-based techniques, actual viewpoint determination is done using the same types of methods involved in photogrammetry (which solves the same problem)[ Sanso, 1973, Thompson, 1958 ] or in alignment approaches to object recognition <ref> [ Huttenlocher and Ull-man, 1987, Grimson, 1990 ] </ref> . The principal shortcoming in both these methods is the difficulty of introducing realistic error models or effective representations of the uncertainty in viewpoint estimates. Feature-based approaches hold the potential for avoiding many of these problems.

Reference-contexts: However, we do have to find long ridge contours that may not be immediately apparent at a given scale. The analysis starts with a characterization of local surface shape of the map in terms of ridges, valleys, peaks, and saddles using the method described in <ref> [ Haralick et al., 1983 ] </ref> . Instead of resampling to produce precise ridge lines, we found it sufficient to impose thresholds when extracting ridge lines and use a thinning algorithm to extract ridge contours.

Reference-contexts: Figure 7 illustrates the hierarchical nature of extracted ridge features. "Dominant" ridge lines are often viewpoint dependent, as shown in the two parts of the figure, each with a view position indicated by a black dot. 3 Matching and Geometric Inference. Feature-based localization involves problem solving <ref> [ Heinrichs et al., 1992 ] </ref> . The integration of symbolic problem solving with signal-level image analysis has long been a goal for many in the computer vision community. Few successful examples exist, however. <p> Both of the low-level feature extraction subsystems were implemented in C, ran on different machines than the Lisp processes, and were interfaced using simple database-like query/response techniques. The example used four of the six high-level reasoning strategies described in <ref> [ Heinrichs et al., 1992 ] </ref> : concentrate on the view first, organize features into configurations, pursue multiple hypotheses, and evaluate hypotheses using a disconfirmation process.

Reference-contexts: It requires an accurate compass registered to the map coordinate system. Determination of viewpoint is done using straightforward trigonometry. Relative bearing: Relative bearings between three or more image features with known map positions lead to a classical "pose estimation" problem. Well established numerical techniques exist for solving such problems. <ref> [ Levitt et al., 1987 ] </ref> describe an alternate method in which only two features are considered at a time. The visual angle between the two features constrains the viewpoint to lie on a particular circle on the map. <p> The visual angle between the two features constrains the viewpoint to lie on a particular circle on the map. Using multiple pairs of features usually allows a unique viewpoint to be found by intersection. Ordinal view: <ref> [ Levitt et al., 1987 ] </ref> show how ordinal position of two features (e.g., "A is left-of B") can be used to constrain the viewpoint to lie on one side of a line through the positions of A and B [ Levitt et al., 1987, Levitt et al., 1988 ] . <p> Ordinal view: [ Levitt et al., 1987 ] show how ordinal position of two features (e.g., "A is left-of B") can be used to constrain the viewpoint to lie on one side of a line through the positions of A and B <ref> [ Levitt et al., 1987, Levitt et al., 1988 ] </ref> . They suggest intersecting this constraint for many different pairs of features. Exact Alignment: If two features line up along a line of sight, then the viewpoint is constrained to lie on a line connecting the two features.

Reference-contexts: Contrast variations across edges that correspond to actual ridge lines can be small and of limited spatial extent. For portions of many ridge lines, contrast variations can be lacking altogether. As a result, scale-space approaches will not succeed. Instead, we use an approach similar to <ref> [ Sha'ashua and Ullman, 1988, Nevatia et al., 1992 ] </ref> . An initial edge map is computed using a zero-crossing edge detector.

Reference-contexts: One key observation arising from our study of how expert map users solve difficult localization problems is that they organize map and view features into configurations before attempting to match them <ref> [ Pick et al., in press ] </ref> . Configurations are small groupings of features (typically two or three) that are close together and often satisfy particular topographic and/or geometric properties that make them distinctive.
