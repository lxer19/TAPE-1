Abstract: Strategies involving smoothing of the objective function have been used to help solve difficult global optimization problems arising in molecular chemistry. This paper proposes a new smoothing approach and examines some basic issues in smoothing for molecular configuration problems. We first propose a new, simple algebraic way of smoothing the Lennard-Jones energy function, which is an important component of the energy in many molecular models. This simple smoothing technique is shown to have close similarities to previously-proposed, spatial averaging smoothing techniques. We also present some experimental studies of the behavior of local and global minimizers under smoothing of the potential energy in Lennard-Jones problems. An examination of minimizer trajectories from these smoothed problems shows significant limitations in the use of smoothing to directly solve global optimization methods.

Reference-contexts: As we mention briefly in Section 6, this property has enabled us to apply our new analytic smoothing approach to general protein conformation problems (see <ref> [1] </ref>). In [21], we have investigated how the shapes of our new family of smoothing functions compare with the class of functions in Fig. 2b from the effective energy transformation scheme. <p> The algebraic smoothing technique described in this paper can be generalized to other functions (usually with poles) that are likely to benefit from smoothing, such as electrostatic forces or attractive/repulsive forces given by different formulas than the Lennard-Jones potential. Currently, as discussed in <ref> [1] </ref>, we are exploring another very similar formula which can smooth both the Lennard-Jones potential and electrostatic potential simultaneously. ~ f &lt;P;fl&gt; (x) = &gt; &lt; r 2 P r 2 P=2 for Lennard-Jones potential q ij q r 2 ij +fl for electrostatic potential (26) In addition, we have developed <p> This approach has been recently applied to protein polyalanine problems with the new smoothing functions (26). Some encouraging results have been obtained and show the advantages of using the smoothing technique in global optimization. These results will be reported in a forthcoming paper <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We can now denote the problem as LJ : min f (x) (3) where f (x) is function (2) and D is some closed region in R n , n = 3N. This problem has been the target of many different computational approaches, such as <ref> [2] </ref> [7] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [15] [16] [20] [23] [25], that make varying amounts of use of the solution structure of Lennard Jones clusters.

A large scale global optimization algorithm that does not utilize the solution structure of the clusters has been developed in past few years by [2], and has successfully solved all Lennard-Jones problems with up to 76 atoms. kluwer.tex; 23/06/1998; 23:50; p.2 3 In practice, interesting molecular conformation problems contain at least 1,000 to 10,000 atoms, and huge numbers of local minimizers. <p> First we describe our experimental methodology. Each of our trajectory tracking experiments starts by using a global optimization program to find a set of minimizers with the original Lennard-Jones function. This global algorithm, which is described in <ref> [2] </ref>, has successfully found the best-known minimizers for all Lennard-Jones problems with up to 76 atoms. It is believed that this program finds all the minimizers of the 9 atom problem, as discussed later, and all 20 minimizers found are used in the trajectory tracking experiments. <p> very similar formula which can smooth both the Lennard-Jones potential and electrostatic potential simultaneously. ~ f &lt;P;fl&gt; (x) = &gt; &lt; r 2 P r 2 P=2 for Lennard-Jones potential q ij q r 2 ij +fl for electrostatic potential (26) In addition, we have developed an approach, based on <ref> [2] </ref>, which utilizes the smoothing technique to dramatically reduce the number of minima at early stages, but does not rely solely on trajectories to find the global minima at final stages.
