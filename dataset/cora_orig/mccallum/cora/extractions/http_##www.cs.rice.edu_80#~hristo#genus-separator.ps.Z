Abstract: This paper develops new techniques for constructing separators for graphs embedded on surfaces of bounded genus. For any arbitrarily small positive " we show that any n-vertex graph G of genus g can be divided in O(n + g) time into components whose sizes do not exceed "n by removing a set C of O( (g + 1=")n) vertices. Our result improves the best previous ones with respect to the size of C and the time complexity of the algorithm. Moreover, we show that one can cut off from G a piece of no more than (1 ")n vertices by removing a set of O( n"(g" + 1) vertices. Both results are optimal up to a constant p

Reference-contexts: The set of vertices C is called an ff-separator. Separator theorems are known for many classes of graphs, i.e. for forests, grids [17], planar graphs [18], graphs of bounded genus [6, 11], graphs with an excluded minor <ref> [2] </ref>, geometric graphs [20], and others. The p n-separator theorem for the class of planar graphs [18] is now a classic result in computational graph theory. If an o (n)-separator theorem exists for S, then one can efficiently apply divide-and-conquer method for solving graph problems on graphs from S.

Reference-contexts: In the final subsection we establish the optimality of our results. 2 Separation graphs We begin with a brief description of some basic notions from topological graph theory. More detailed and formal treatment can be found in <ref> [14] </ref>. A graph G is an ordered pair (V (G); E (G)) of sets, where V (G) is a set of vertices and E (G) is a set of edges. Each edge is an unordered pair of different vertices. We will consider graphs embedded on orientable surfaces.
