Abstract: Visionary projections of a wide-area network teeming with intelligent agents describe an environment where end-users and their agents can pick and choose among a great variety of potentially valuable information services. However, neither network capabilities nor users' time and money are infinite. Computational markets provide one type of mechanism for allocating limited resources in such an environment in a distributed, dynamic way. Moreover, the underlying economic theory provides an analytical framework for predicting aggregate behavior and designing individual agents. In this paper, we describe a prototypical computational market model for information services distributed over a network. Our initial focus is on the economic problem of when and where to establish mirror sites for the more popular information services. Competitive agents choose to set up mirrors based on going prices for network bandwidth, computational resources, and the information service. Depending on the experimental setup, we observed a range of qualitative behaviors.

Reference-contexts: In other words, each agent is potentially interested in combinations or bundles of goods (resources, services), rather than a single type. For information networks of significant scope, such as digital libraries <ref> (Birmingham et al. 1994) </ref> or distributed databases (Stonebraker et al. 1994), it appears inevitable that considering the allocation of multiple resources and services at once will be necessary. <p> We believe moreover that the economic model of agent interaction provides a useful framework for system design. To explore this possibility, we are currently applying the ideas of market-oriented programming to one large-scale information services network, the University of Michigan Digital Library <ref> (Birmingham et al. 1994) </ref>. Our design for this system is based on a network of specialized information agents, interacting as suppliers and producers in a virtual information-services economy (Birmingham et al. 1995).

Reference-contexts: Our design for this system is based on a network of specialized information agents, interacting as suppliers and producers in a virtual information-services economy <ref> (Birmingham et al. 1995) </ref>. Within this system, efficient allocation of basic computational resources (memory, processing, bandwidth) as well as information goods and more complex value-added services will be a key to effective behavior of the overall system.

Although the contract net per se did not use real economic mechanisms, some economic concepts can be readily incorporated (Sand-holm 1993).

Reference-contexts: Other theoretical properties of equilibrium (to be illustrated below) can be used by designers to configure the system so that it achieves some desired aggregate behavior. Areas where market-oriented programming has been applied to date include transportation planning <ref> (Wellman 1993) </ref>, distributed engineering design (Wellman 1995a), and allocation of computational resources (Bogan 1994; Doyle 1994). Although experience with the approach is still limited, some general understanding of the technique's characteristics is beginning to emerge (Well-man 1995b). <p> Blue-Skies Economy For our initial exploration of resource allocation on an information services network, we have developed a simple computational economy consisting of one type of service offered at a variety of sites. The model is a direct extension of our previously developed transportation economy <ref> (Wellman 1993) </ref>, which solved a distributed version of the multicommodity flow problem. The problem of routing information over a communications network is analogous; here, too, we have to choose routes simultaneously between several origins and destinations. <p> To achieve a given behavior, there are in general many parameter settings that will do the job. If we had further behavioral constraints, these arbitrary settings are available as extra degrees of freedom. Finally, we note that indeed, when run under wal-ras (our market-oriented programming environment, see <ref> (Wellman 1993) </ref>), this economy in fact produces the expected results. That is, the theoretical analysis is in fact validated by the behavior actually resulting from the distributed bidding behavior of the consumer agents we constructed. Conclusion Preliminary results show that under certain conditions the optimal mirror site configuration is chosen.
