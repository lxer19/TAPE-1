Abstract: We provide a formal framework for studying broadcasting schemes and design a family of schemes for broadcasting popular videos, called the Greedy Disk-conserving Broadcasting (GDB) scheme. We analyze the resource requirements for GDB, i.e., the number of server broadcast channels, the client storage space, and the client I/O bandwidth required by GDB. The analysis shows that GDB exhibits a tradeoff between any two of the three resources. We compare our scheme with a recently proposed broadcasting scheme, Skyscraper Broadcasting (SB). With GDB, we can reduce the client storage space by as much as 50% or the number of server channels by as much as 30% at the cost of a small additional increase in the amount of client I/O bandwidth. If we require the client I/O bandwidth of GDB to be identical to that of SB, GDB needs only 70% of the client storage space required by SB or one less server channel than SB does. In addition, we show that with small client I/O bandwidth, the resource requirements of GDB are close to the minimum achievable by any disk-conserving broadcasting scheme.

Reference-contexts: The drawback of this scheme is that a client needs to have sufficient disk space to store more than 70% of one video file. To address the problem of the disk space requirements, Aggarwal, Wolf and Yu devised a scheme called Permutation-Based Pyramid Broadcasting (PPB) <ref> [1] </ref>. The PPB scheme divides a video object the same way as the PB scheme and multiplexes several channels among one segment of video data. The similar partition strategy limits the disk space reduction and typically requires a client disk capable of storing at least 50% of a video's data.

Reference-contexts: In a batch scheduling scheme, a group of requests that arrive close in time are batched together and when a channel becomes available, the server selects a batch according to some scheduling policy, satisfying the requests with the channel. Some efficient batch scheduling policies are studied in <ref> [6, 7, 2] </ref>. In a broadcasting scheme, the server broadcasts a video via multiple dedicated channels and each client follows a reception schedule to receive data from appropriate channels so as to continuously playback the whole video.

Reference-contexts: The number of server channels is the total number of channels required for the dedicated network channels. The network uses a multicast communication facility to transmit the video streams to clients so that a client can select which channels it wishes to receive from <ref> [5, 9] </ref>. Each client contains a set-top box, a disk, and a display monitor. A client is connected to the network with a set-top box. The set-top box selects several network channels to receive video data from according to a reception schedule.

The simplest broadcasting scheme is the EB scheme that divides the video into equal-length segments <ref> [6] </ref>. The EB scheme guarantees a worst case service latency equal to the length of one segment, independent of the number of of requests, since a client waits at most the length of one segment for the playback to start.

Reference-contexts: The similar partition strategy limits the disk space reduction and typically requires a client disk capable of storing at least 50% of a video's data. Recently, Kua and Sheu proposed a broadcasting scheme <ref> [10] </ref>, called Skyscraper Broadcasting (SB), that further reduces the client disk space requirement. The SB scheme uses a novel data partition strategy and exhibits a tradeoff between the client storage space and the server network bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the number of dedicated channels required for a video is inversely proportional to the guaranteed service latency. To decrease the number of required channels, Viswanathan and Imielinski proposed an ingenious broadcasting scheme, called Pyramid Broadcasting (PB) <ref> [11] </ref>. The main idea of the PB scheme is to divide a video into segments of geometrically increasing size. Each segment is broadcast periodically via a dedicated channel that has a bandwidth greater than the playback rate.
