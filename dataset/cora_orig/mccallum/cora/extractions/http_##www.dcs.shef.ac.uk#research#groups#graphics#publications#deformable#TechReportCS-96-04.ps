Title: Physically Based Modelling of Human Limbs

Abstract: This paper considers the modelling of human limbs featuring deformable tissue, which automatically exhibit realistic be-haviour when simulated in a synthetic environment. A limb model is proposed that incorporates a simple skeleton joint, muscle tissue, non-muscle tissue (e.g. fat), tendons and a skin layer. The only input parameters to the model are for simple low-level control of muscle activation, with the resulting motion and deformation of the limb being generated automatically. To demonstrate the approach we have implemented a preliminary model of the limb which incorporates a new mass-spring-damper model based on octahedral elements for modelling the deformable tissue. The results show effects that occur in real limbs such as bulging and creasing at joints. KEYWORDS: Animation, Modelling, Dynamics, Simulation, Deformation, Elastic, Human, Limb, Tissue. CR CATEGORIES: I.3.7 Three dimensional graphics and realism (Animation): I.6.3 Simulation and modelling (Applications).

Reference-contexts: This is the simplest method to implement, and allows the basic behaviour of the model to be tested, however it is inefficient since it is prone to instability unless the time steps are kept sufficiently small. Improved methods are the midpoint method or a fourth order Runga-Kutta (see <ref> [1] </ref>). Using automatically varied time steps is also desirable otherwise the simulation has to be monitored to ensure it remains stable. Adaptive time step methods are included in [1] and [12]. Another feature of the current system is that the simulation stepsize is constant throughout the model. <p> Improved methods are the midpoint method or a fourth order Runga-Kutta (see <ref> [1] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Quantities called nominal stress and nominal strain can be used to give crude measures of the loading on the sample and its resulting deformation. More refined measures exist, e.g. true stress and true strain (see <ref> [2] </ref>), but the former will suffice for this discussion. Nominal stress is given by = F=A, and nominal strain by * n = u=l. To simulate the tests, one end of the sample was effectively fixed to the floor, and the other end fixed to a moving block.

Reference-contexts: A third application area is in the ergonomic design of environments. Here, virtual limb models or full human models can be used to test a proposed human environment for safety or comfort without the need for real physical prototypes. An example of this type of model is "JACK" <ref> [3] </ref>. Real limbs are composed of complex structures of de-formable tissue (e.g. muscle, fat etc.) and non-deformable tissue (bone). Accurately modelling the way in which these structures behave and interact is a significant challenge.

Reference-contexts: The position of the points on the cylinder are then transformed into cylindrical coordinates producing a two dimensional set of points. These points are then triangulated using a 2D Delauney Triangulation algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>. Finally, the triangulation is applied to the original points to produce a surface mesh on the limb. The surface is rendered using standard Gouraud shading (other techniques could be used to give improved realism, e.g. bump mapping and texture mapping). of the skin surface.

Reference-contexts: Physically based models attempt to model the low level behaviour of material, and its interaction with other objects. If the model is sufficiently close to the real thing, and includes the relevant physical phenomena, then it should au tomatically generate realistic behaviour when simulated. In <ref> [9] </ref> Gourret et al. present a physically based model of a hand consisting of a skeleton (driven by a "classical" control method, i.e. parametric, kinematic or dynamic), and a layer of deformable flesh modelled using the Finite Element Method (FEM).
