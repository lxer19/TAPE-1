Reference-contexts: The state of these network components at any time is collectively referred to as the network state. Dynamic control can be used to determine the set of paths to be provided by a network state in response to requests for paths from the application <ref> [1] </ref>. This requires the network state to be created while the application is executing. A distributed approach to network control allows each processor to determine the network state independently, but in a manner consistent with all other processors.

Reference-contexts: The generated state can be used alone or with other similarly generated states as part of a time division multiplexed cycle. 2 Network Architecture and State Determination We consider a multi-stage interconnection network built from 2x2 electro-optical switches, such as Lithium Niobate switches <ref> [2] </ref>. The switches may be set to the straight position, in which each input port (i.e. upper and lower) is connected to the corresponding output port, and the cross position, in which the input ports are connected to the opposite output ports.
