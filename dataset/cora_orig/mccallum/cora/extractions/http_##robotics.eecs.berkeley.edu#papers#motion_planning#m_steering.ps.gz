Reference-contexts: As in our earlier work we have not been explicit in taking into account the existence of differentials in systems of this kind which results in the two wheels of a single axle moving through different amounts in the course of a turn <ref> [1] </ref>. The present system appears at first glance to be a straightforward extension of the systems we considered in [5, 20, 23, 24], but our main motivation in writing this paper is to show how much richer and more complex the current system is in its structure.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we will only be interested in this particular chained form (5) which has a single generator. Chained form systems were first introduced in [16] as a class of systems inspired from <ref> [2] </ref> to which one could convert a number of interesting examples, including a car and a car with one trailer, and for which it was easy to derive steering control laws. Some sufficient conditions for converting two-input drift-free systems into chained form were presented in [16].

Reference-contexts: Stabilization for Multi-input Chained Form Systems. We now briefly discuss some methods from the literature for stabilization of chained form systems. These systems are open-loop controllable, as shown above by the various point-to-point steering algorithms, but are not stabilizable by pure smooth static-state feedback <ref> [3] </ref>. Bearing this result in mind, various researchers have tried to stabilize such systems by time-varying or non-smooth state feedback. Many of the algorithms for point stabilization require the system to be in chained form.

Reference-contexts: The motion planning problem for the single-steering n-trailer system was considered and solved by us in [20, 24]. Mobile robot systems of this kind are of interest in practical applications; part of the motivation for this work came from our work on the fire truck <ref> [5, 23] </ref> (the fire truck is an example of a system with three axles and two steering wheels, corresponding to the driver in the front and tiller in the rear). <p> The present system appears at first glance to be a straightforward extension of the systems we considered in <ref> [5, 20, 23, 24] </ref>, but our main motivation in writing this paper is to show how much richer and more complex the current system is in its structure. The strategy we will use for motion planning is to first convert the kinematic equations into a multi-chained form. <p> Section 5 contains two examples, one of which is the fire truck, worked out to demonstrate the methods of Sections 2-4. The transformation to chained form for the fire truck presented in Section 5 is different from that proposed in <ref> [5, 23] </ref> since it involves the use of a virtual axle for steering the rear axle. The question of when dynamic state feedback is absolutely necessary for this class of systems is thus an open one. Section 6 contains some concluding remarks. 2. <p> This system as defined is a very general system, and includes the following as special cases: (1) the standard n trailer system of [12, 16, 20, 24] corresponds to m = 1. (2) the fire truck of <ref> [5, 23] </ref> corresponds to m = 2, n 2 = n 1 = 1. <p> Some sufficient conditions for converting two-input drift-free systems into chained form were presented in [16]. In later work <ref> [5] </ref> in the context of steering the fire truck (a three-input system with no drift), we gave sufficient conditions for converting a multi-input system into a multi-input chained form. <p> Steering with Sinusoidal Inputs. A method for steering multi-chained systems with sinusoids was proposed in <ref> [5] </ref>. This method is step-by-step and uses one step to steer each level of the chain (although the states of all chains at the same level can be steered simultaneously). <p> Examples of Multi-Steering Trailer Systems Some examples of systems that fit into the class of multi-steering n-trailer but have been examined in previous papers include the n-trailer system with one steering wheel (see, for example, [20]) and the fire truck system <ref> [5] </ref> which has three axles and two steering wheels. To illustrate the procedure that we presented in this paper for converting multi-steering trailer systems into chained form, we will follow through the algorithm given in Section 3 for two example systems. 5.1. Fire Truck Example. <p> Fire Truck Example. Although the fire truck example has been examined extensively in previous work, we will also consider it in terms of the algorithm described in this paper, since the formulation is somewhat different than in <ref> [5] </ref>. In that paper, the bottoms of the chains in the multi-input chained form were chosen to be the (x; y) position of the passive axle along with the angle of the trailer (see Figure 8).

Reference-contexts: Also, we have been told anecdotally about the construction of such n-trailer systems with multi-steering for use in nuclear environments <ref> [6] </ref> and also for baggage handling in new airports [10]. In all of these applications it is felt that the multi-steering systems will be more maneuverable than a single-steering system.

Reference-contexts: The results of the current paper appear to indicate 2 TILBURY, SRDALEN, BUSHNELL, SASTRY that this is not true for more than two inputs without allowing for the possibility of dynamic state feedback. As such this provides a valuable counterpoint to the results of Gardner and Shadwick <ref> [9] </ref> and our own results in [4]. The outline of our paper is as follows: in Section 2, we develop a kinematic model of the multi-steering n-trailer system with the rolling without slipping constraints on each of the axles.

Reference-contexts: In their work they have shown that chained form systems are a special case of what are known as differentially flat systems; the bottoms of the chains in the chained form play the role of flat outputs. For the two input case, it was pointed out by Martin <ref> [13] </ref> and Murray [15] that, modulo somewhat different regularity conditions, chained forms are equivalent to flat systems for the type of drift-free systems that arise in nonholonomic motion planning.

Reference-contexts: The easiest way to remedy this situation is to first choose an intermediate point and then plan the path in two pieces. 22 TILBURY, SRDALEN, BUSHNELL, SASTRY 4.2. Steering with Piecewise Constant Inputs. This steering method was originally inspired by multirate digital control <ref> [14] </ref>, but is most easily understood in terms of motion planning simply as piecewise constant inputs.

Similarly to the previous section, if the first input does come out to be zero from equation (29), then a slight modification of this method is necessary.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for converting two-input systems into chained form were given in <ref> [15] </ref>, where a connection was made between the chained form and its dual in the terminology of one-forms, called the Goursat normal form. In [24] we applied these results to show transformations to convert the system of a car with n trailers into the two-input chained form.

Reference-contexts: The resulting extended system can be put into chained form. This chained form, which was introduced in <ref> [16] </ref> and used in our earlier work on the single-steering n-trailer system in [20, 24], enables us to use a variety of steering and stabilization techniques that we have developed in previous work. <p> If the last axle is steerable, then we will have n m1 = n m . This system as defined is a very general system, and includes the following as special cases: (1) the standard n trailer system of <ref> [12, 16, 20, 24] </ref> corresponds to m = 1. (2) the fire truck of [5, 23] corresponds to m = 2, n 2 = n 1 = 1. <p> However, we emphasize that chained forms are bilinear in the input and state variables and not linear. Furthermore they are drift-free. The state equations in each chain in (5) are multiplied by u 0 ; we call this the generating input. A more general chained form <ref> [16] </ref> can have more than one generating input, and thus multiple chains leading down from each input. In this paper, we will only be interested in this particular chained form (5) which has a single generator.

Reference-contexts: Thus we will briefly describe some of these results to give the reader an idea of the possibilities available for stabilizing a system once it has been converted into chained form. In <ref> [17] </ref>, a non-smooth, time-varying feedback control law achieving local exponential convergence to a neighborhood of the origin for two-input chained form systems was presented. A method for globally stabilizing about the origin with exponential convergence rates was proposed in [21] for a two-input, single-chain chained form system.

We assume each body (trailer or car) has only one axle, since, as we have shown in <ref> [24] </ref>, a two-axle car is equivalent (under coordinate transformation and state feedback) to a one-axle car towing one trailer. 2.1. Configuration Space. <p> If the last axle is steerable, then we will have n m1 = n m .

Therefore, we also propose an "all-at-once" sinusoids method which is an extension of that detailed in <ref> [24] </ref> for the two input single chain case. We only use one step, and we put all of the necessary frequencies into the inputs. u 0 = ff 0 + ff sin !t . . . The input parameters are found in the same manner as in the other methods.

Reference-contexts: Many of the algorithms for point stabilization require the system to be in chained form. For two-input systems, a class of smooth, time-varying control laws for local and global asymptotic stabilization to a point [22]. This procedure was extended in <ref> [25] </ref> to locally asymptotically stabilizing the origin of (m + 1)-input, m-chain, single-generator chained form systems.
