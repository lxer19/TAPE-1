Title: Design and Use of Dynamic Modeling in ASCEND IV  
Author: Jennifer L. Perry Benjamin A. Allan 
Abstract: 2 We present an alternative design for communicating information between an interactive, equation-based modeling environment user and an initial value problem (IVP) solver. The design is practically demonstrated by connecting the widely available integrator LSODE and the freely available plotting program Xgraph to the ASCEND IV 3 modeling environment. In contrast to the ASCEND III integrator interface, this new design allows an order of magnitude improvement in the ease of developing an understanding of a dynamic models behavior. The improvement is in part achieved by allowing the user to interactively define what time varying quantities should be recorded for postprocessing by graphics packages or other tools without requiring that a new ASCEND model be compiled, thus making visualization easy. The more significant improvement, however, is the new ability to select any part of the complete dynamic model and solve it, thus making exploration of component dynamic behaviors easy. Finally, the user may interactively change a variable between algebraic and dynamic (state or derivative) roles. This makes it possible to negotiate a solution to the index problems which frequently arise in chemical engineering.

Reference-contexts: Without going through the details of the theory behind mathematical modeling, we will describe the general basis of the alpha_ash model. The theory which was used to create this model is described in <ref> [AW96] </ref>. The model presented below is a multi-component ash separation unit where the split fractions, alpha [components], are defined arbitrarily. The dynamics of the system are described by a component mass balance which is defined for each component in the system.

Reference-contexts: The others were rejected because of the reuse problems they posed. Identify the derivative and state variables at run time by having ags within the solver_var <ref> [AW97] </ref> that users can manipulate interactively, as is done for communi cating algebraic problem specifications to ASCEND IIIs algebraic solvers. Identify states and derivatives by giving each type a different root in the type hierar chy.

Reference-contexts: This conditional modeling area is under development by Vicente Rico-Ramirez. Another significant improvement in ASCEND IV would be to attach a more efficient DAE integrator, such as a sparse version of DASSL <ref> [BCP89] </ref>, to the system. Another improvement, and one that is necessary for commercial dynamic modeling, would be to incorporate strategies for handling discontinuities into the integration software and interface.

Reference-contexts: In Section 8 we present a simple example of a dynamic flash drum modeled, solved, and plotted in ASCEND IV. In Section 9 we present the most complete and detailed example available from ASCEND III, an ammonia synthesis flowsheet <ref> [Mon96] </ref>. A more detailed description of the new ASCEND IV plotting capability is available in the ASCEND IV on-line help and may be given in a future technical report. A brief note on typography may help in understanding this report.

Reference-contexts: The use of an obs_id makes this particularly easy, indeed it is the foundation of an improved plotting ability. The local users of ASCEND are not content with a raw data set, however, so we also provide a Tcl/Tk <ref> [Ost94] </ref> based tool, ASC_PLOT, for manipulating data files and creating 12 REUSABILITY IN ASCEND IV plots with Xgraph or any other plot tool which can accept a text file as input.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, it may be solved without extensive initialization work in each new application. From this definition it follows that ASCEND III <ref> [PMW93] </ref> does not have reusable models within its libraries. However, with ASCEND IV, we come closer to obtaining reusable dynamic models in the ASCEND environment.

Reference-contexts: library definitions mixer, reactor, and ash as follows: MODEL fragment; m IS_A mixer; r IS_A reactor; f IS_A flash; m.outstream, r.instream ARE_THE_SAME; r.outstream, f.instream ARE_THE_SAME; END fragment; This way we can solve the difficult degrees of freedom problem that occurs in dynamic modeling using the same simple techniques advocated by <ref> [Wes96] </ref> for strictly algebraic systems built of complex, self-contained parts. <p> If the model is put into a larger hierarchical model, we simply run the set_ode method recursively for the individual sub-models, as is done with the standard reset method <ref> [Wes96] </ref>. In addition to setting the ode_type within the METHODS section of the model, we can change this instance interactively through the ASCEND interface. This is beneficial when negotiating an index problem.
