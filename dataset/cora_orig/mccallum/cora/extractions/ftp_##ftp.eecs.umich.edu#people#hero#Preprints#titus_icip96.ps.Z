Abstract: This paper presents a method for incorporating anatomical NMR boundary side information into penalized maximumlikelihood (PML) emission image reconstructions. The NMR boundary is parameterized as a periodic spline curve of fixed order and number of knots that is known a priori. Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation of the spline coefficients yields an "extracted" boundary, which is used to define a set of Gibbs weights on the emission image space. These weights, when coupled with a quadratic penalty function, create an edge-preserving penalty that incorporates our prior knowledge effectively. Qualitative analysis demonstrates that our method results in smooth images that do not suffer loss of edge contrast, while quantitative estimates of bias and variance for various values of the smoothing parameter show an improvement over standard quadrat-ically penalized maximum likelihood.

Reference-contexts: Recently, however, various researchers have suggested that when functional and anatomical boundaries are likely to be spatially correlated, anatomical boundary curves from NMR images, when used as side information, might improve the quality of emission image reconstructions [1],[2], <ref> [3] </ref>. We focus on the case where a single boundary of interest is present in both the emission and NMR images.

Reference-contexts: The smoothing parameter fi controls the tradeoff between the conflicting goals of maximizing ln f (y; ) and minimizing P (). The objective function maximum can not be found analytically; therefore, an iterative method must be used. In the sequel we use the SAGE3 algorithm <ref> [7] </ref> to maximize (3). This EM-type algorithm is characterized by monotonic, fast convergence. Choosing a uniform weight scheme (e.g. all ! kj = 1) results in a global smoothing of the reconstructed image that in turn causes severe bias as image detail is blurred indiscriminantly across region boundaries.
