Reference-contexts: As an example, our Subdue system was developed to evaluate the effectiveness of the minimum description length principle to discover regularities in a variety of scientific domains <ref> (Cook, Holder, & Djoko 1996) </ref>. Another factor is that some scientific discovery systems deal with richer data representations that only degrade scalability. A number of attribute-value-based approaches have been developed that discover concepts and can address issues of data relevance, missing data, noise, and utilization of domain knowledge. <p> Subdue has been successfully applied to databases in domains including image analysis, CAD circuit analysis, Chinese character databases, program source code, chemical reaction chains, Brookhaven protein databases, and artificially-generated databases <ref> (Cook, Holder, & Djoko 1996) </ref>. The results of the scalability study in this paper are demonstrated on databases in two different domains. The first type of database is a graph representation of CAD A-to-D converer circuit provided by National Semiconductor containing 8,441 edges and 19,206 edges.

For example, the Subdue system uses a graph-based representation of the input data that captures the structural information.
