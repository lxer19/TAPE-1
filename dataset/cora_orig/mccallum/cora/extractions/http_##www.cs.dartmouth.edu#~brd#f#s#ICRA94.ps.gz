Abstract: This paper investigates manipulation tasks with arrays of microelectromechanical structures (MEMS). We develop a geometric model for the mechanics of microactuators and a theory of sensorless, parallel manipulation, and we describe efficient algorithms for their evaluation. The theory of limit surfaces offers a purely geometric characterization of microscale contacts between actuator and moving object, which can be used to efficiently predict the motion of the object on an actuator array. It is shown how simple actuator control strategies can be used to uniquely align a part up to symmetry without sensor feedback. This theory is applicable to a wide range of microactuator arrays. Our actuators are oscillating structures of single-crystal silicon fabricated in a IC-compatible process. Calculations show that these actuators are strong enough to levitate and move e.g. a piece of paper.

Reference-contexts: Our work addresses in particular the first three points. We are interested in computational tools for the design, analysis, and control of MEMS. Based on work on sensorless and near-sensorless manipulation <ref> [8, 11] </ref>, we have developed geometric theories of manipulation and control for microactuator arrays, and we have developed and implemented efficient algorithms for their evaluation. Simultaneously we have designed, built, and tested microfabricated actuators (length, width 50 m to 200 m) in the National Nanofabrication Facility at Cornell University. <p> Their ideas have been the basis for a wide range of results, see e.g. [22, 4, 7, 14]. In this line of work on sensorless manipulation, Peshkin and Sanderson [18] have shown how to align parts on a conveyer belt with stationary fences. Goldberg <ref> [11] </ref> has given an algorithm to align parts by a sequence of grasps with a parallel-jaw gripper. <p> In the following we show how, under reasonable assumptions, the problem of aligning a part with a microactuator array can be reduced to the alignment task with a parallel-jaw gripper, effectively using the actuator array as a two-finger gripper. Goldberg's algorithm <ref> [11] </ref> takes the geometry of an arbitrary polygonal part P and determines its squeeze function s : S 1 ! S 1 , where S 1 is the set of planar orientations. <p> Goldberg then gives an algorithm that, given a specific squeeze function, computes a sequence of grasp orientations to uniquely align P (up to symmetries) from an arbitrary initial orientation (Figure 3d). Let us summarize the results: Theorem 1 (Goldberg <ref> [11] </ref>) Let P be a polygon whose convex hull has n vertices. There is a sensorless control strategy S for a parallel-jaw gripper that aligns P up to symmetries in O (n) squeeze grasps. <p> This assumption will not hold in general, however it is not essential to the reduction and can be relaxed as described later. It corresponds exactly to the assumption that the parallel-jaw gripper performs pure squeeze grasps in which both jaws make contact with the part simultaneously <ref> [11] </ref>. 2Phase : The motion of P has two phases: (1) Pure translation towards l until condition I is satisfied. (2) Motion until condition II is satisfied without violating condition I. The following definition is in analogy with the di ameter function above: Proc. of IEEE Int. <p> P is stable if t () = 0, t (+) 0, and t () 0. Otherwise P is metastable. Using this lemma we can identify all stable orientations, which allows us to construct the squeeze function of P in analogy to Goldberg <ref> [11] </ref>: Lemma 6 Let P be a simple polygonal part on an actuator array A such that assumptions Simplicity, Bilateral Symmetry, Density, and 2Phase hold. Given the turn function t of P , its corresponding squeeze function s : S 1 ! S 1 is constructed as follows: 1. <p> From t we can construct the squeeze function s (Lemma 6) with equal complexity bounds. Then the alignment strategy S is obtained by using Goldberg's algorithm <ref> [11] </ref> (Theorem 1). 2 From the proof we obtain upper bounds for the complexity of microactuator alignment strategies: Corollary 8 If P is a n-gon, the algorithm runs in time O (n 4 ) and produces a strategy S = (l 1 ; : : : ; l k ) of <p> If P is convex the running time is O (n 2 ) and k = O (n). Finally let us reconsider two of the assumptions made earlier in this section. Relaxing 2Phase corresponds to allowing push-squeeze grasps for the parallel-jaw gripper <ref> [11] </ref> in which one jaw pushes P before the second jaw makes contact with P . The squeeze function must be replaced by a shift-squeeze function which Proc. of IEEE Int. Conf. on Robotics and Automation, San Diego, CA, May 1994. takes combined translational and rotational motions into account.

Their ideas have been the basis for a wide range of results, see e.g. <ref> [22, 4, 7, 14] </ref>. In this line of work on sensorless manipulation, Peshkin and Sanderson [18] have shown how to align parts on a conveyer belt with stationary fences. Goldberg [11] has given an algorithm to align parts by a sequence of grasps with a parallel-jaw gripper.

Reference-contexts: = (n T T s 1 ) T = T s More generally, if the surface patch of L 0 can be represented as a linear transform of the unit sphere, then determining F a reduces to solving a Model Trust Region problem which has been studied in nonlinear optimization <ref> [23] </ref>. For some special cases like flat surfaces or straight lines the solution to the Model Trust Region problem yields simple formulas for F a . Ellipsoidal surfaces require solving quartic equations. Hence for a large class of surfaces we can compute exact solutions.

Reference-contexts: The actuators are etched out of a single-crystal silicon wafer in a SCREAM (Single Crystal Reactive Etching and Metallization) process <ref> [24, 25] </ref>. The resonator grids are patterned in a photolithography step and released in a sequence of etching and oxidation steps. The metal electrodes are deposited during a self-aligning aluminum evaporation. Single beams are close to 1 m wide and 3 m high, with 3 m clearance.
