Reference-contexts: As a result, the instrument prices given by equations (4.1), with local volatility given by (4.3), are consistent with the quoted prices C i 's. The existence and properties of extreme points of U are related to properties of the function in (4.2). These results are presented in <ref> [AFHS96] </ref> for the Black-Scholes equation. As it is there stated, under certain assumptions on , W (R; t; V; ) is a convex function of ( 1 ; ; n ), and hence there is only one extreme point for U and it is a minimum.

Because of these limitations, the method of choice for path-dependent options is usually Monte Carlo simulations.

Recombining trees are far more efficient than non-recombining trees, even if more limited, since merging the paths implies the loss of path-history information.

Create a tree for the evolution of R 0 . Here we use the trinomial tree model, which allows the change of local volatility by adjusting the transition probabilities, as presented in <ref> [AP96b] </ref>. 2. Propagate the attributes forward, according to each node's local volatility and transition probabilities, as given by the initial volatility surface. 3.

Reference-contexts: Trees can, nevertheless, be used to price path-dependent contingent claims. 1.7.2 The Heath-Jarrow-Morton model The approach used in this model <ref> [HJM92] </ref> consists of imposing a general random structure on the forward rate process, and deriving bond and contingent claim prices from it. This random structure gives, for every t, a distribution on the set of functions f (t; ), the forward rate curve at time t. <p> Z expresses the amount of riskless asset a portfolio can buy. In fact, under several regularity assumptions, they prove (see Heath et al) <ref> [HJM92] </ref>) that a no-arbitrage condition, namely of the existence of the market price for risk, is equivalent to the existence of a probability measure under which Z (t; T ) is a martingale for all t and T . <p> Avellaneda and Lewicki [LA96] study a one-factor, discrete-time model for the time evolution of the spot rate process, in which the spot volatility can depend on time and spot-rate level. This model is based on Heath-Jarrow-Morton arbitrage-free considerations <ref> [HJM92] </ref> and prescribes the following process for the spot rate R (t): R (t) = R (t 1) + t V t + f (t) + J t t; (1.22) where V t = P t1 s , f (t) = f (t)f (tt), with f the forward rate curve (1.11)

Reference-contexts: A description of these and other forms 9 of interest rate contingent claims can be found in [Hul93]. The increase in their popularity, as well as in the volatility of the interest rate has turned bond pricing into a primary concern in financial research <ref> [HL86] </ref>. As we have seen in the previous section for the case of stock options, the theory must provide both a model of the evolution of some "fundamental" variables and a means of pricing all instruments based on this model. <p> We now give a more detailed description of two models in this class, as the approach taken in Chapter 3 is related to both. 1.7.1 The Ho-Lee model The Ho-Lee model <ref> [HL86] </ref> is based on the evolution of the bond price process, the term structure, which is represented as the prices P n i , at time n, and in state i, of bonds with maturities n + kt; k = 0; 1 : : :.

Reference-contexts: Just as in the case where the underlying asset is a stock, it is arguable that if the market price for the contingent claim is different from the one prescribed by the Black-Scholes equation, there would be arbitrage opportunities (see <ref> [HP81] </ref>). Of course, the exactness of this claim depends on how well the Black-Scholes model adjusts to the case of interest rate contingent claims. <p> Contingent claim pricing Within the Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework, the approach to contingent claim valuation is based on market completeness ideas developed in <ref> [HP81] </ref>. A contingent claim is defined as a non-negative random variable X, the market completeness hypothesis states that for any such variable there is a self-financing portfolio of bonds such that its price is, with probability one, equal to that of the contingent claim.

The increase in their popularity, as well as in the volatility of the interest rate has turned bond pricing into a primary concern in financial research [HL86]. <p> According to their choices of fundamental variables and the models they propose for their evolution, approaches to fixed-income derivatives pricing are classified in three groups <ref> [Hul93] </ref>: * extensions of the Black-Scholes model, * one-factor models for the short rate, * arbitrage-free models, which are designed so that they are consistent with the term structure of the market at the moment the model is built. 1.5 Black-Scholes based methods The methods in this category assume that bond <p> is assumed by the Black-Scholes analysis by having the underlying stock price follows a process of the form given in equation 1.1.) For contingent claims with a short life (compared to that of the bond), assuming that the bond price has a constant volatility still leads to a valid estimate <ref> [Hul93] </ref>. <p> Closed-form formulae exist for bond prices in both mod els <ref> [Hul93] </ref>. By assuming randomness in the spot rate the way these models do, too much freedom is given to the future spot rate processes (forward rates): the market's estimates for these rates are available as part of the market day-to-day information. <p> It is possible to go back and forth from one to the 20 other by Equations 1.11 and 1.19; for both set of values we have initial data available from the market's day-to-day information. Ho-Lee's model was found to be redundant <ref> [Hul93] </ref>: the parameter measuring market price for risk is superfluous. Besides, the method's use of only one source of randomness makes all the movements in the bond price curve to be perfectly correlated.

Reference-contexts: Option prices are computed by solving (1.2) for the particular boundary conditions that the security being priced satisfies. In this setting, the Feynman-Kac formula relates the solution of this equation to the discounted expected value of the instrument's payoff <ref> [Sch80] </ref>: P (t; S) = E t;S [f (S (T ))e r (T t) ]; (1.4) which is an instance of the option pricing theory claim stated above.

Reference-contexts: By taking advantage of special properties of the payoff functions, it is in some cases possible to introduce a change of variable that reduces to two the dimension of a 3-dimensional pricing equation, as presented for example in <ref> [WHD93] </ref>, pg 179, for Asian options. Nevertheless, such approaches heavily rely on the particular form of the payoff function and are therefore hard to generalize: in particular, they can only be used to price one instrument at a time.
