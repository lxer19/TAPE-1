Abstract: In ATM networks, buffering is required to reduce cell loss and increase bandwidth utilization by the bursty traffic. Several types of traffic with different performance requirements on delay and loss will share buffer resources. We focus on the fully shared buffer with push-out and a randomized service priority rule. Some conservation relations are obtained which can be used to tune the parameters of the buffering and service disciplines. fl Supported by: NSERC of Canada, Pacific Bell, Micro Grant of the State of California

Reference-contexts: Work conserving disciplines (requiring a fully shared buffer) maximize total throughput while minimizing the aggregate cell loss rate (Theorem 1 in <ref> [1] </ref>); but, they are twice as slow as the segregated or partially shared buffer approaches because they require handling linked lists (see, e.g., [5]). We focus on the fully shared buffer with push-out and randomized service priority disciplines. <p> Conservation relations can be used to tune the parameters of the buffering and service disciplines. Our results (in Claims 2 and 3 below) are a refinement of the conservation laws in <ref> [1] </ref>. We also generalize the results in [2] where a buffer with head-of-the-line service priority and push-out loss priority mechanisms is discussed assuming Poisson arrivals. In section 2, the push-out and randomized service priority disciplines are described when there are two buffer sources (voice and data). <p> Note that, with coupled arrivals and initial state, the right-continuous aggregate occupancy processes of both buffers are identical. For each cell served when both data and voice are queued, to determine whether it's voice or data an independent random variable ffi is generated with uniform distribution on the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. If ffi &gt; p v (respectively, ffi &gt; ^p v ) a data cell departs from the p v (respectively, ^p v ) buffer; otherwise a voice cell departs.

Reference-contexts: We focus on the fully shared buffer with push-out and randomized service priority disciplines.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the performance requirement could be specified by a two bit field in each ATM cell's header. Many buffering and service strategies have been proposed in the literature to satisfy the different sources' requirements on loss and delay: see <ref> [6] </ref> for a survey of buffering disciplines for loss priorities. For example, partial buffer sharing (see, e.g., [8],[3]), segregated buffers for each traffic type, and fully shared buffers with push-out have been proposed to handle different cell loss requirements.

Reference-contexts: A highly compressed, real-time video call and network signaling traffic may be both loss and delay sensitive. Finally, a "casual" electronic mail message may be neither loss nor delay sensitive (see <ref> [7] </ref>). Thus, the performance requirement could be specified by a two bit field in each ATM cell's header. Many buffering and service strategies have been proposed in the literature to satisfy the different sources' requirements on loss and delay: see [6] for a survey of buffering disciplines for loss priorities.
