Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The present paper is a continuation of <ref> [1] </ref>. It develops the notion of inclusion in a categorical setting, emphasizing the idea of factorization. 2 Preliminaries The reader is supposed to be familiar with basics of category theory [6, 5]. In this section we present our formalism and remind the reader some notions used later in the paper. <p> Notice that every category A admits a trivial w.i.s. in which I contains only identities and E = A. The following fact contains properties of w.i.s. proved in <ref> [1] </ref>: Fact 10 If hI; Ei is a w.i.s. of A, e 2 E and i 2 I, then 1. I contains only monics. 2. Each morphism in I " E is an identity. 3. right-cancellable: If f ; i 2 I then f 2 I. 4. <p> isomorphisms in A are in E. 9. diagonal-fill-in: If f ; i = e; g then there is a unique morphism h 2 A such that e; h = f and h; i = g: f // ** i * g h * The following proposition is also proved in <ref> [1] </ref> and it says that inclusions are preserved under pullbacks: Proposition 11 If A has pullbacks and a w.i.s. hI; Ei, and if i : B ,! Y is an inclusion and f : X ! Y is any morphism, then there is a unique pullback of the pair hi; f

Abstract semantics is given for modularization in [8], based on strong inclusions; no factorization (see Definition 8) is involved, which means that, perhaps, strong inclusions are good enough technical tools to handle complex modularization concepts.

Reference-contexts: This section presents an alternative of the inclusion system, called complete w.i.s., which does not require the morphisms in E be epimorphisms, still having much of the power of inclusion systems. For example, <ref> [9] </ref> presents Birkhoff-like axiomatizability results for a categorical generalization of equational logic strongly based on inclusion systems; all the results in that paper could be very well done in a framework based on complete w.i.s. instead of inclusion systems.
