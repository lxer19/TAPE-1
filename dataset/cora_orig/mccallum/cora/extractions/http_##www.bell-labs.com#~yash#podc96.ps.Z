Title: How to be an Efficient Snoop, or the Probe Complexity of Quorum Systems (Extended Abstract)  
Author: David Peleg Avishai Wool 
Note: n is non-evasive.  
Abstract: A quorum system is a collection of sets (quorums) every two of which intersect. Quorum systems have been used for many applications in the area of distributed systems, including mutual exclusion, data replication and dissemination of information When the elements may fail, a user of a distributed protocol needs to quickly find a quorum all of whose elements are alive, or evidence that no such quorum exists. This is done by probing the system elements, one at a time, to determine if they are alive or dead. This paper studies the probe complexity PC(S) of a quorum system S, defined as the worst case number of probes required to find a live quorum or to show its non-existence in S, using the best probing strategy. We show that for large classes of quorum systems, all n elements must be probed in the worst case. Such systems are called evasive. However, not all quorum systems are evasive; we demonstrate a system where O(log n) probes always suffice. Then we prove two lower bounds on the probe complexity in terms of the minimal quorum cardinality c(S) and the number of minimal quorums m(S). Finally we show a universal probe strategy which never makes more than c(S) 2 probes, thus any system with c(S) p

Reference-contexts: Several basic properties of dominated and non-dominated coteries are proved. Many different quorum systems constructions appear in the literature. The simplest systems use voting to define the quorums [Tho79, Gif79]. Alternative constructions appear in [Mae85] (using finite projective planes), <ref> [AE91] </ref> (the Tree system), [CAA90] (using a grid), [Kum91, KC91, RST92] (hierarchical systems). The triangular system is due to [Lov73, EL75]. The Wheel system appears in [HMP95]. A general class of quorum systems called "crumbling walls", which contains several of the above-mentioned systems, is defined and analyzed in [PW95b, PW96]. <p> The Wheel is a crumbling wall with two rows of width 1 and n 1. The triangular (Triang) system [Lov73, EL75] is another crumbling wall, in which row i has width i. In the Tree system <ref> [AE91] </ref> the elements are organized in a complete rooted binary tree. A quorum in the system is defined recursively to be either (i) the union of the root and a quorum in one of the two subtrees, or (ii) the union of two quorums, one in each subtree. <p> Proof: An adversary strategy A (ff) which forces the user Alice to probe all n inputs is the following: Answer the first k 1 probes by "1". Answer the next n k probes by "0". Answer the n'th probe by ff. Corollary 4.10 The Tree <ref> [AE91] </ref> and HQS [Kum91] quorum systems are evasive. Proof: By Proposition 4.9 the 2-of-3 majority function is evasive. The HQS system is a complete ternary tree of 2-of 3 majorities, so by induction on the tree height and using Theorem 4.7 at each level it follows that HQS is evasive. <p> Remark: The lower bound of Proposition 5.2 is not exactly tight for any NDC that we are aware of. However this lower bound is often better than that of Proposition 5.1, as the following examples show. * In the Tree system <ref> [AE91] </ref>, c (Tree) log n and m (Tree) 2 n=2 , so Proposition 5.2 gives a linear lower bound of PC (Tree) n=2, much better than that of Proposition 5.1, but still short of the truth which is PC (Tree) = n by Corollary 4.10. * The Triang system [Lov73], is

Alternative constructions appear in [Mae85] (using finite projective planes), [AE91] (the Tree system), [CAA90] (using a grid), [Kum91, KC91, RST92] (hierarchical systems).

A general class of quorum systems called "crumbling walls", which contains several of the above-mentioned systems, is defined and analyzed in [PW95b, PW96]. Quorum systems, as tools for distributed protocols, were analyzed using various performance measures. <p> We prove that large classes of quorum systems are evasive, including voting systems, crumbling walls, the finite projective plane, and compositions of these. However, and somewhat surprisingly, we show that not all quorum systems are evasive. We do this by demonstrating that the Nuc system of <ref> [EL75] </ref> requires only O (log n) probes in the worst case. Next we prove two general lower bounds on the probe complexity of a quorum system in terms of combinatorial parameters of the system S. <p> A quorum in a wall is the union of one full row and a representative from every row below the full row. The Wheel is a crumbling wall with two rows of width 1 and n 1. The triangular (Triang) system <ref> [Lov73, EL75] </ref> is another crumbling wall, in which row i has width i. In the Tree system [AE91] the elements are organized in a complete rooted binary tree. <p> A quorum in the system is defined recursively to be either (i) the union of the root and a quorum in one of the two subtrees, or (ii) the union of two quorums, one in each subtree. The nucleus (Nuc) system of <ref> [EL75] </ref> is built in two stages. First consider a nucleus universe U 1 of size 2r 2 for some r &gt; 1, and add to S all the subsets of U 1 of size r. <p> However for the class of non-dominated quorum systems this is not the case. Below we show a non-dominated uniform quorum system, that has no dummy elements (i.e., every element belongs to some minimal quorum), which is not evasive. Consider the Nuc system of <ref> [EL75] </ref>, described in Section 2.2. All it's quorums are of size c (Nuc) = r, and it has n = 2r 2 + 1 2r2 elements, so c (Nuc) 1 2 log 2 n. We next show that in the Nuc system, O (log n) probes always suffice. <p> every finite projective plane with quorums of size c has n = c 2 c + 1, and the 7 element system (the only ND one) is evasive by Example 4.2. * The only c-uniform ND quorum systems with c p that we are familiar with are the Nuc of <ref> [EL75] </ref> and a variation of it by [Tuz85], both with c = O (log n).

Reference-contexts: If P i even a S P a S i then PC (S) = n, i.e., S is evasive. Example 4.2 The only finite projective plane (FPP) sys tem [Mae85] that is ND is the 7-point Fano plane <ref> [Fu90] </ref>. For this system we have a FPP = (0; 0; 0; 7; 28; 21; 7; 1) by inspection, so the sum on the even indices is 35 while on the odd indices it is 29. Therefore by Proposition 4.1 the FPP system with n = 7 is evasive.

Reference-contexts: Karp conjectured that in fact every such property is evasive, i.e., requires that all n arguments be tested. The Aanderaa-Rosenberg conjecture was proved by [RV76], who also showed that almost every boolean function is evasive for large n. Karp's stronger conjecture was later proved by <ref> [KSS84] </ref>. To our knowledge, the probe complexity of quorum systems, or equivalently, the argument complexity of boolean functions characterizing a quorum system, has not been studied before. In fact, most of the techniques of [RV76] and [KSS84] are not applicable in our case. <p> Karp's stronger conjecture was later proved by <ref> [KSS84] </ref>. To our knowledge, the probe complexity of quorum systems, or equivalently, the argument complexity of boolean functions characterizing a quorum system, has not been studied before. In fact, most of the techniques of [RV76] and [KSS84] are not applicable in our case. This is since both proofs rely on the fact that a graph property P has a nice algebraic structure: the group of permutations of the k vertices acts transitively on the n = k edges while preserving P . <p> Therefore it is reasonable to expect that in a class of functions that has a "nice" structure, all the functions are evasive. This indeed is the case for graph-property functions, as shown by <ref> [RV76, KSS84] </ref>. However for the class of non-dominated quorum systems this is not the case. Below we show a non-dominated uniform quorum system, that has no dummy elements (i.e., every element belongs to some minimal quorum), which is not evasive. Consider the Nuc system of [EL75], described in Section 2.2.

Reference-contexts: Quorum systems, as tools for distributed protocols, were analyzed using various performance measures. The most widely studied measure is the availability (cf. [BG87, PW95a]).

The measure we call probe complexity is equivalent to the notion of the argument complexity of a boolean function, which is the maximum number of arguments of a boolean function f that must be tested in order to compute f .

Reference-contexts: Karp conjectured that in fact every such property is evasive, i.e., requires that all n arguments be tested. The Aanderaa-Rosenberg conjecture was proved by <ref> [RV76] </ref>, who also showed that almost every boolean function is evasive for large n. Karp's stronger conjecture was later proved by [KSS84]. To our knowledge, the probe complexity of quorum systems, or equivalently, the argument complexity of boolean functions characterizing a quorum system, has not been studied before. <p> Karp's stronger conjecture was later proved by [KSS84]. To our knowledge, the probe complexity of quorum systems, or equivalently, the argument complexity of boolean functions characterizing a quorum system, has not been studied before. In fact, most of the techniques of <ref> [RV76] </ref> and [KSS84] are not applicable in our case. This is since both proofs rely on the fact that a graph property P has a nice algebraic structure: the group of permutations of the k vertices acts transitively on the n = k edges while preserving P . <p> Saying that a quorum system S is evasive (as in Definition 3.2) is equivalent to saying that its characteristic function f S is evasive (as a boolean function). 4 Evasiveness 4.1 The Algebraic Approach As part of their work on the evasiveness of graph properties, Rivest and Vuillemin <ref> [RV76] </ref> give in their Corollary 3.3 a sufficient condition for the evasiveness of a general monotone boolean function. Below we rephrase their result using our terminology, to obtain a condition for quorum system evasiveness based on the availability profile (recall Defini tion 2.7). Proposition 4.1 [RV76] Let a S be the <p> graph properties, Rivest and Vuillemin <ref> [RV76] </ref> give in their Corollary 3.3 a sufficient condition for the evasiveness of a general monotone boolean function. Below we rephrase their result using our terminology, to obtain a condition for quorum system evasiveness based on the availability profile (recall Defini tion 2.7). Proposition 4.1 [RV76] Let a S be the availability profile of a quorum system S 2 NDC. If P i even a S P a S i then PC (S) = n, i.e., S is evasive. <p> Therefore by Proposition 4.1 the FPP system with n = 7 is evasive. In their proof that almost all n-argument boolean functions f are evasive for large n, <ref> [RV76] </ref> in fact shows that the condition of Proposition 4.1 holds for all but an exponentially small fraction of the boolean functions. However, when we consider only the class NDC, the next proposition shows that Proposition 4.1 has limited usefulness. <p> Remark: Finding the critical partition in step 2 is an NP-hard problem, but we assumed that the adversary has unbounded power. 4.3 A Non Evasive Example All the examples we have seen so far are of evasive quorum systems. Furthermore, in <ref> [RV76] </ref> it is shown that almost every boolean function on n variables is evasive for large n. Therefore it is reasonable to expect that in a class of functions that has a "nice" structure, all the functions are evasive. <p> Therefore it is reasonable to expect that in a class of functions that has a "nice" structure, all the functions are evasive. This indeed is the case for graph-property functions, as shown by <ref> [RV76, KSS84] </ref>. However for the class of non-dominated quorum systems this is not the case. Below we show a non-dominated uniform quorum system, that has no dummy elements (i.e., every element belongs to some minimal quorum), which is not evasive. Consider the Nuc system of [EL75], described in Section 2.2.
