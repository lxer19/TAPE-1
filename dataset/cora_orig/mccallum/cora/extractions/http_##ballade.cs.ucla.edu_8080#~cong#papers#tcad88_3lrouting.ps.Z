Abstract: We present in this paper a new approach to the three or four layer channel routing problem. Since two layer channel routing has been well studied, there are several two layer routers which can produce optimal or near optimal solution for almost all the practical problems. We develop a general technique which transforms a two layer routing solution systematically into a three layer routing solution. The solution transformation approach is different from previous approaches for three layer and multi-layer channel routing. Our router performs well in comparison with other three layer channel routers proposed thus far. In particular, it provides a 10-track optimal solution for the famous Deutsch's difficult example, whereas other well-known three layer channel routers required 11 or more tracks. We extend our approach to four layer channel routing. Given any two layer channel routing solution without unrestricted dogleg that uses w tracks, our router can provably obtain a four layer routing solution using no more than R w /2 H tracks. We also give a new theoretical upper bound R d /2 H + 2 for arbitrary four layer channel routing problems.

Reference-contexts: Enbody and Du [11] developed a multi-layer router using leading column heuristics and limited backtracking. As for theoretical results, Hambrusch [15] obtained some near optimal upper bounds for the case of two terminal nets allowing mixed wiring on the same layer. Brady and Brown <ref> [1] </ref> proposed an algorithm which produces asymptotically optimal results when the number of layers is large. However, their algorithm does not include the case of three layer routing. Also their bounds on four layer routing is quite loose for most known problems. <p> The advantage of the HVVH assignment is that when we switch from one vertical layer to the other vertical layer we do not block a track in the horizontal layers. Using HVVH assigmnent, we can improve the theoretical bound in <ref> [1] </ref> for four layer channel routing as shown in the following theorem. Theorem 4-2 For a channel routing problem with density d , using the HVVH assignment we can obtain a four layer routing solution using at most R J d hh J + 2 tracks. <p> The running time is in O (T ), where T = total number of terminals occupied by the nets in the problem. Proof Using the method in <ref> [1] </ref> by pairing up columns two by two and using two extra track at the top and the bottom of the channel for jogging, we can modify the problem such that two g g g ... g g V 1 H 2 (a) g g g ... g gH 1 V <p> Thus, we can complete vertical connections successfully. The algorithm use 2 tracks for jogging and R J d hh J tracks for horizontal wires of all the nets. Thus, the total number of tracks used is bounded by R J d hh J + 2. According to <ref> [1] </ref>. the modification stage takes O (T ) time. Obviously, both the horizontal track assignment and the vertical wire connection take O (T ) time. Thus, the algorithm runs in O (T ) time. ` For L layer channel routing problem (L 5), we can use the algorithm presented in [1] <p> <ref> [1] </ref>. the modification stage takes O (T ) time. Obviously, both the horizontal track assignment and the vertical wire connection take O (T ) time. Thus, the algorithm runs in O (T ) time. ` For L layer channel routing problem (L 5), we can use the algorithm presented in [1] to obtain near optimal solutions. Their algorithm uses R J d hhhhhh H J tracks and runs in O (T ) time, where K is the minimum number of tracks allowed between two overlaped wires. 5.

Reference-contexts: There are several two layer channel routers which can produce channel routing solutions using at most 1 or 2 tracks more than channel density for most practical problems. With the advance in VLSI technology, utilization of more than two layers for signal routing has become feasible. As mentioned in <ref> [3] </ref>, such a possibility has been exploited in the design and implementation of a number of gate arrays. The Motorola 2900ETL macrocell array is a bipolar gate array which uses three metal layers for routing. <p> Our three layer consistently produce better solutions.

Reference-contexts: For fixed n (n 3), it is still open whether the n processor scheduling problem is NP-complete or polynomial time solvable. Fortunately, it has been known for more than a decade that two processor scheduling problem is polynomial time solvable <ref> [6, 12, 13] </ref>. According to the result by Gabow [13], the two processor scheduling problem can be solved in linear time. Thus, we can obtain an optimal track permutation in time linear proportion to the number of the tracks in a given solution.

Reference-contexts: A New Approach to Three Layer Channel Routing There are two possible ways to assign layer types in three layer channel routing, one is VHV, and the other is HVH. In the VHV model, we can always use the left edge algorithm <ref> [16] </ref> to obtain a solution using d tracks, which is the best possible solution since we have only one horizontal layer. But such a solution is usually not the optimal solution for three layer channel routing. <p> Then we assign the horizontal interval of each net to the tracks on two horizontal layers evenly according to the left edge algorithm <ref> [16] </ref>, which will use R J d hh J tracks in each layer at most. Then we do the vertical connection column by column.
