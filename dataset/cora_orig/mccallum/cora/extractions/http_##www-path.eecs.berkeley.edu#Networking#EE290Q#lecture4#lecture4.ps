Title: EE 290Q Topics in Communication Networks Lecture Notes: 4

Abstract: Preface The lecture is in a series on Analysis of the end-to-end performance of a network . This lecture focuses on end-to-end service curve of a GPS network. Such analysis is helpful in estimating the worst-case end-to-end delay. Assuming a leaky bucket regulator at the source, and Consistent Relative Session Treatment (CRST), the idea of service curve is used to calculate a lower bound on the number of packets serviced during a period of time. This calculations assume a stable network. The material is based on an article by Parekh and Gallager [2] and an article by Cruz [1].
