Title: d d  Standardization of the Complement/Adjunct Distinction  
Author: Adam Meyers, Catherine Macleod and Ralph Grishman, 
Affiliation: New York University  
Abstract: This paper reports on criteria for distinguishing complements from adjuncts in the development of COMLEX Syntax , a large on-line syntactic lexicon of English. Correct, or at least consistent, criteria are crucial for lexicography and natural language processing. Complement/adjunct criteria from linguistics and lexicography leave a gray areaoptional complements are difficult to distinguish from adjuncts. In an experiment we conducted, four graduate students make substantially the same Complement/Adjunct distinctions for 205 examples using our criteria.

Reference-contexts: In our view, Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English (Proctor 1978, referred to below as LDOCE) makes this distinction adequately (although we are unsure what criteria they use). However, we have detected some errors in making this distinction in the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary <ref> (Hornby 1980, referred to below as OALD) </ref>. For example, (1a,b,c,d) each contain a subordinate clause (gerundal or infinitival). The bracketed adjunct phrases in (1a,b) are adjuncts (OALD marks them as complements), but (1c,d) are complements.

Reference-contexts: Frequency XP occurs with verb V with high relative frequency 7. Typical Complements NPs, PPs headed by "to", clauses (other than relatives, "whether" and "if") 8.

Reference-contexts: 1. Lexicography and the Complement/Adjunct Distinction Since complements, but not adjuncts, should be listed in lexical entries of verbs, it is important that lexicographers have clear criteria. In our view, Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English <ref> (Proctor 1978, referred to below as LDOCE) </ref> makes this distinction adequately (although we are unsure what criteria they use). However, we have detected some errors in making this distinction in the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary (Hornby 1980, referred to below as OALD).

Reference-contexts: MDA972-92-J-1016 and N00014-90-J-1851, and The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania. 1 Extractions (in WH questions, relative clauses, etc.) of either a complement or an adjunct out of a syntactic "island" <ref> (See Ross 1967 and Huang 1982) </ref> may be ill-formed, but complement extraction is "better" than adjunct extraction. For example, the extraction out of the NP headed by fact is better in (i) than in (ii) (Either answer could be eating her lunch).
