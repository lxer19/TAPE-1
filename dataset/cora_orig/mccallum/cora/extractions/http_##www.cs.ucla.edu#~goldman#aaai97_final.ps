Reference-contexts: Such a collection exists and is in fact published (Kucera & Francis 1967). Future Work By treating word frequencies as binomial random variables, there are advantages not available to conventional routing methods. Renewal theory is used in communications to estimate failure rates <ref> (Gut 1988) </ref>. Since the theory was developed for binomial random variables, we can apply it to routing. It allows estimates of frequencies to be made by only examining a small part of the document. In a real routing application, this is critical.

Reference-contexts: Introduction The research goal of information routing (IR) is to retrieve and rank a collection of text documents that coincide with a user profile <ref> (Harman 1995) </ref>. Ideally, the profile can be derived automatically from a set of documents the user has identified as relevant to a particular topic of interest. The assumption for this work is a user has provided this small set of documents. <p> It is then our goal to rank a previously unseen set. With other researchers trying to solve this problem, the focus has become a question of which paradigm is able to rank these documents appropriately <ref> (Harman 1995) </ref>. Approaches vary from conventional probabilistic models and vector space models, to Boolean models and complex weighting schemes (Salton 1989). Methods from all fields have been able to effectively retrieve the appropriate documents. The variability in performance, however, comes from their ability to rank them (Harman 1995). <p> rank these documents appropriately <ref> (Harman 1995) </ref>. Approaches vary from conventional probabilistic models and vector space models, to Boolean models and complex weighting schemes (Salton 1989). Methods from all fields have been able to effectively retrieve the appropriate documents. The variability in performance, however, comes from their ability to rank them (Harman 1995). This led researchers to focus on weighting methods in order to artificially push more relevant documents toward the top of the list. However, there is no theoretical basis to suggest this approach will generalize. Our methods, on the other hand, have a theoretical foundation in mathematics.

Reference-contexts: We can now compare two documents term by term, as a pair of binomial random variables. As a baseline with which to compare, we can use a large collection of documents of varying topics. Such a collection exists and is in fact published <ref> (Kucera & Francis 1967) </ref>. Future Work By treating word frequencies as binomial random variables, there are advantages not available to conventional routing methods. Renewal theory is used in communications to estimate failure rates (Gut 1988). Since the theory was developed for binomial random variables, we can apply it to routing.

Reference-contexts: Theoretical Foundation IR justifies the use of term frequency from the notion that writers normally repeat certain words as they advance their argument. Moreover, words are repeated as the writer elaborates on the subject <ref> (Luhn 1958) </ref>. Salton further appeals to Zipf's law (Salton 1983) to strengthen the position of using term frequencies. Although these notions appeal to our intuition, they are not mathematical principles.
