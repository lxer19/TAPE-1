Abstract: The acyclic directed Steiner tree problem (ADSP) requires a minimal outward tree within an acyclic digraph with edge costs G = (V; E; d) which connects a root r with a distinguished subset S ae V , #S = k. The best possible performance guarantee of any polynomial approximation algorithm for ADSP cannot be less than 1

Reference-contexts: The approximation complexity of NSP and NWSP is already determined. NSP belongs to M AXSN P -class [2], so a constant factor approximation algorithm exists [13] and for some * &gt; 1, *-approximation is N P -complete <ref> [1] </ref>. For NWSP, a 2 log k-approximation algorithm was designed [7]. From the other side, the famous set cover problem may be embedded in NWSP.

Reference-contexts: The elements of the set S are called terminals. The number of terminals is denoted by k. ADSP is also known as the Steiner arborescence problem in acyclic networks [5]. It has various practical applications. The most important occurs in biology while constructing philogenetic trees <ref> [3] </ref>. A number of papers are devoted to the case of a digraph embedded in a d-dimensional rectilinear metric. For d = 2, a fast and effective heuristic was proposed in [11], however this case has not yet been shown to be N P -hard.

Reference-contexts: RSH gives a 1 5=3 and a 1 a 2 2 for NSP [14] and a 1 a 2 2 log k for NWSP [7]. GGH gives a 1 5=3 and a 1 a 2 11=6 for NSP [16]. SRGH gives lim r!1 a 1 = 1 <ref> [4] </ref> and lim r!1 a 2 = 1 + ln 2 for NSP [17]. In other words, it induces a polynomial (1 + ln 2)-approximation scheme for NSP. In this paper we present a level-restricted relative greedy heuristic (LRGH).
