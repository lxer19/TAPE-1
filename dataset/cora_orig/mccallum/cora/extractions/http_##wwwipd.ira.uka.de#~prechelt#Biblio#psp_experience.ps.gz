Abstract: Experience Report: Teaching and Using Abstract PSP is a methodology for an individual software engineer's continuous self-improvement. Currently, few PSP experience reports are available from non-US sources, and hardly any from people other than the PSP inventor Watts Humphrey. We describe independent experiences with PSP. We find that PSP is a viable and useful approach and has quantifiable, positive impact. Problems in teaching PSP are in keeping students motivated and keeping them focused on general ideas instead of details. Problems in using a personal software process are keeping enough self-discipline and finding proper tool support. the Personal Software Process (PSP)

Reference-contexts: 1 The Personal Software Pro cess (PSP) The Personal Software Process (PSP) framework is an approach suggested by Watts Humphrey in 1995 <ref> [1] </ref>. It describes a method ology that leads an individual software engineer towards disciplined, well-defined work with continuous self-improvement. The PSP ideas are independent of programming language, application domain, and team organization; they can be applied to programming as well as to many non-programming tasks. <p> Second, at least students with little team project experience do not recognize why good planning is important at all. 1 Therefore, we recommend to introduce reviews much earlier in the course than <ref> [1] </ref> suggests. Students then have the constant motivation to strive for zero defect programs and there is no longer emphasis on planning alone. In our next course we plan to introduce reviews in week 3 or 4 instead of week 8.

Reference-contexts: However, as far as we know only Humphrey has published PSP experiences in widely accessible publications, e.g. <ref> [2] </ref>. In the following we describe our experiences with teaching and using PSP, based on our courses for graduate students, researchers, and professional software engineers.
