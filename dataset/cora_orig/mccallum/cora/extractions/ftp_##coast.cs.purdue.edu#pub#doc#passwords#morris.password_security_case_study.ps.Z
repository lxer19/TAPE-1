Title: Password Security: A Case History  
Author: Robert Morris Ken Thompson 
Abstract: This paper describes the history of the design of the password security scheme on a remotely accessed time-sharing system. The present design was the result of countering observed attempts to penetrate the system. The result is a compromise between extreme security and ease of use.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Password security on the UNIX time-sharing system <ref> [1] </ref> is provided by a collection of programs whose elaborate and strange design is the outgrowth of many years of experience with earlier versions.

Reference-contexts: IMPROVEMENTS TO THE FIRST APPROACH 1. Slower Encryption Obviously, the first algorithm used was far too fast. The announcement of the DES encryption algorithm <ref> [2] </ref> by the National Bureau of Standards was timely and fortunate. The DES is, by design, hard to invert, but equally valuable is the fact that it is extremely slow when implemented in software.

Reference-contexts: When the user later tries to log in to the system, the password that he types is encrypted and compared with the encrypted version in the password file. If the two match, his login attempt is accepted. Such a scheme was first described in <ref> [3, p.91ff.] </ref>. It also seemed advisable to devise a system in which neither the password file nor the password program itself needed to be protected against being read by anyone.

Reference-contexts: Most of the standard encryption methods used (in the past) for encryption of messages are rather easy to invert. A convenient and rather good encryption program happened to exist on the system at the time; it simulated the M-209 cipher machine <ref> [4] </ref> used by the U.S. Army during World War II. It turned out that the M-209 program was usable, but with a given key, the ciphers produced by this program are trivial to invert.
