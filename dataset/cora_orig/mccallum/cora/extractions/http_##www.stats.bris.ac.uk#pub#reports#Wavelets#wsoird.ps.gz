Abstract: This article addresses the problem of denoising piecewise constant functions by using both an adapted moving average and Haar wavelet shrinkage. The piecewise constant functions are contaminated with Poisson-like noise and are measurements of perceived itch by human subjects in an experiment to relate perceived itch to bloodflow in response to histamine iontophoresis. We show that the translation-invariant wavelet transform with universal wavelet shrinkage provides a fast and automatic method for producing good estimates of the underlying perceived itch and that the method is superior to the adapted moving average and standard wavelet shrinkage. The article then looks in more detail at the noise structure of the signals and highlights some new wavelet techniques that might be useful.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 describes wavelet shrinkage using the discrete wavelet transform and shows how it performs well except for a noticeable Gibb's effect near jumps. Using Coifman and Donoho's TI-transform <ref> [2] </ref> the over- and undershooting effects almost completely disappear resulting in extremely good estimates. Section 5 looks in more detail at the noise that is present with the itch response data and makes suggestions about more advanced shrinkage methods that could be used. <p> If anything, the results were worse. However, since the problem seemed to be a Gibb's effect (or under/overshooting on discontinuities) we turned to the work of Coifman and Donoho <ref> [2] </ref> who explained that Gibbs effects were probably due to the discontinuities being located between wavelets (remember wavelets are aligned to an nested dyadic grid).

Reference-contexts: Many methods have been created to choose a threshold value at which smaller coefficients are removed. In this paper we only consider two: universal thresholding (or VisuShrink) and SUREshrink. Detailed descriptions of these two techniques can be found in Donoho and Johnstone <ref> [4] </ref> and [5] respectively.

Reference-contexts: It is accepted that after this period the static presence of the chamber on the skin will not cause itch. Further details about the methodology and applications of iontophoresis are given in Harris <ref> [7] </ref>. These experiments test the hypothesis that the level of itch which a subject feels is linked to the increase in blood flow around the skin area where the ion-tophoresis takes place. To test this hypothesis, the blood flow and subjective itch are measured simultaneously.

Reference-contexts: It may be the case that models using Poisson distributed noise will be just as, if not more, successful. In the future we would like to incorporate Poisson error distributions and also more advanced thresholding techniques such as: choosing different thresholds for different resolution levels, see Johnstone and Silverman <ref> [8] </ref>; applying the methods of Kovac [10] which extend the wavelet shrinkage method to datasets with arbitrary design and number of points whilst retaining the speed of computation. 7 Acknowledgments We would like to thank Francis McGlone for supplying the data used in this article.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, most wavelet shrinkage models (including the ones we used above) assume normally distributed errors which is certainly not the case here. Kolaczyk <ref> [9] </ref> provides a more detailed description of what to do in certain cases of Poisson noise, although this extension is beyond the scope of the present paper. However, since we know the amplitude and form of the noise it is quite easy to choose a threshold value.
