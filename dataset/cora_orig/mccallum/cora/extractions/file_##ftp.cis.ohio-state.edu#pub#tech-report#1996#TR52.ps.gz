Abstract: ATM switches respond to UBR congestion by dropping cells when their buffers become full. TCP connections using the UBR service experience low throughput and low fairness. For 100% TCP throughput each switch needs buffers equal to the sum of the window sizes of all the TCP connections. Intelligent drop policies can improve the performance of TCP over UBR with limited buffers. The UBR+ service consists of enhancements to UBR for intelligent drop. We found that Early Packet Discard (EPD) improves throughput but does not improve fairness. Selective packet drop based on per-connection buffer occupancy improves fairness. The Fair Buffer Allocation scheme further improves both throughput and fairness. Notice: This contribution has been prepared to assist the ATM Forum.

EPD drops complete packets instead of partial packets. As a result, the link does not carry incomplete packets which would have been discarded during reassembly.

Reference-contexts: For more general configu rations with upstream bottlenecks, the max-min fairness criteria <ref> [5] </ref> can be used. 4 TCP over UBR In its simplest form, an ATM switch implements a tail drop policy. When a cell arrives at the FIFO queue, if the queue is full, the cell is dropped, otherwise the cell is accepted.

Reference-contexts: A policy for selective cell drop based on per-VC accounting can be used to improve fairness. Enhancements that perform intelligent cell drop policies at the switches need to be developed for UBR to improve transport layer throughput and fairness. Heinanen and Kilkki <ref> [6] </ref> have designed a drop policy called Fair Buffer Allocation (FBA) that attempts to improve fairness among connections. The FBA scheme selectively drops complete packets from a connection based on the connection's buffer occupancy. <p> A VC that is using up excessive share of the throughput or buffer capacity can be penalized preferentially over another. The scheme presented here is a simpler version of the Fair Buffer Allocation scheme proposed in <ref> [6] </ref> and described in the next section. Selective Drop keeps track of the activity of each VC by counting the number of cells from each VC in the buffer. A VC is said to be active if it has at least one cell in the buffer. <p> This frees up some bandwidth and allows the underloading connections to increase their window and obtain more throughput. * Fairness and efficiency increase with increase in buffer size. * Fairness decreases with increasing number of sources. 7 UBR+: The Fair Buffer Allocation Scheme The Fair Buffer Allocation Scheme proposed by <ref> [6] </ref> uses a smooth form of the parameter Z anc compares it with the Load ratio of a VC. To make the cutoff smooth, FBA uses the current load level in the switch.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Unspecified Bit Rate (UBR) service provided by ATM networks has no explicit congestion control mechanisms <ref> [8] </ref>. However, it is expected that many TCP implementations will use the UBR service category. TCP employs a window based end-to-end congestion control mechanism to recover from segment loss and also avoid congestion collapse.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we select WAN buffer sizes of 12000, 24000 and 36000 cells. These values are chosen because most feedback control mechanisms can achieve steady state in a fixed number of round trip times, and have similar buffer requirements for zero loss at the switch <ref> [9] </ref>. It is interesting to assess the performance of vanilla UBR in this situation. For LANs, 1 RTT fi Bandwidth is a very small number (11 cells) and is not practical as the size for the buffer. For LAN links, the buffer sizes chosen are 1000, 2000, and 3000 cells.

Reference-contexts: The retransmission timer is calculated as a function of the estimates of the average and mean-deviation of the RTT <ref> [12] </ref>. Because of coarse grained TCP timers, when there is loss due to congestion, significant time may be lost waiting for the retransmission timeout to trigger. The source does not send any new segments when duplicate acks are being received.
