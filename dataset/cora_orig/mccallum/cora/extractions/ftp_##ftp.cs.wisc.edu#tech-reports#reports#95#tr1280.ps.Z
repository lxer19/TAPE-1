Abstract: Convergence Results for GMRES(m) Abstract. We present a necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of the GMRES(m) method. We present examples illustrating situations in which GMRES(m) stalls, i.e., fails to converge. Several theorems are proved regarding the convergence of GMRES(m) for special classes of matrices.

Reference-contexts: Thus the least squares solution results in a solution with residual norm less than fi and GMRES (m) does not stall. In <ref> [1] </ref>, it is observed that the stalling of GMRES (m) is related to the singularity of the matrix H 0 m formed from the first m rows of H m : As Theorem 3.1 shows, stalling is equivalent to this matrix having the first row be identically zero. <p> Examples. In this section we present two examples of matrices of dimension N with N &gt; m for which GMRES (m) fails to converge. This first example has been presented by Brown in <ref> [1] </ref>. Example 1.

Reference-contexts: The Jacobian of F at this x is the identity matrix. Thus there is a solution x for all vectors b near to b (0); see e.g., Buck <ref> [2] </ref> sect. 5.7. In particular, for " sufficiently small there is a solution x (") corresponding to b ("): By taking fl = " 1 there is a solution to the system (4.2).

Reference-contexts: Either the eigenvalues are too scattered around the origin or the matrix is too far from being a normal matrix or both of these conditions hold together. These ideas are illustrated by the theorems in the next section. The paper <ref> [6] </ref> by Nachtigal, Reddy, and Trefethen contains several test matrices for GMRES and other methods. Those that cause difficulty for GMRES (m) have the basic form of the above examples. 5. Special Cases. In this section we present several special classes of matrices for which GMRES (m) converges.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction. The GMRES method was introduced by Saad and Schultz <ref> [8] </ref> as an iterative method to solve linear systems of equations. The advantage of the GMRES method over methods such as the conjugate gradient method and many other methods is that it can be applied to systems for which the matrix of coefficients is not symmetric or positive definite. <p> The success of GMRES (m) as a computational procedure depends on having an efficient means of solving the least squares problem (2.2). The solution of the least squares problem depends on the Arnoldi relations and is discussed in <ref> [8] </ref>. We begin by deriving the Arnoldi relation. <p> Continuing by interchanging summations Q 2 P k P k1 i;j j=0 h 2 = j=0 i=0 h 2 P k1 0;j P k1 j+1;j + i=1 h 2 j=0 h 2 : Using the relation, from (2.1), see also <ref> [8] </ref>, h 2 j X h 2 we have Q 2 P k1 P k1 0;j j=0 h 2 = j=0 kAv j k 2 j=0 h 2 1 : Thus, using h 0;j = (v 0 ; Av j ); Q 2 P 2 1 P k1 P k1 and
