Abstract: Physical defects cause behaviors unmodeled by even the best fault simulators, which complicates predictive diagnosis. This paper reports on a diagnosis procedure that uses modified composite signatures constructed from single stuck-at information combined with a lexicographic matching and ranking algorithm. The diagnosis procedure is used to perform high-quality bridging fault diagnosis for more than 400,000 diagnostic experiments involving dropping or adding behaviors from the simulations of faulty circuits.

Reference-contexts: Our technique was highly successful at diagnosing bridging behaviors. However, variable logic thresholds downstream from the fault site (also known as the Byzantine Generals Problem for bridging faults <ref> [1, 2] </ref>) caused the diagnosis procedure to provide no candidate faults (an empty diagnosis) roughly ten percent of the time. <p> Acken and Millman demon 2 strated that wired-logic is a poor predictor of CMOS bridge behavior and suggested the voting model to take into account variable drive strengths in CMOS logic gates <ref> [1] </ref>. However, they pointed out that their method did not address the Byzantine Generals Problem for bridging faults [2].

Reference-contexts: Even minor modeling deficiencies may cause largely unrecognizable behavior if the state of the modeled machine and the chip being diagnosed begin to diverge. Although many of these shortcomings are acceptable for fault-grading, the accuracy required by a sophisticated model-based diagnosis algorithm is much greater. Aitken <ref> [3] </ref> has demonstrated some of the problems with fault prediction, and presented a process of validation and refinement of fault models to improve their accuracy vis-a-vis actual behaviors.

Reference-contexts: The purpose of fault diagnosis is to specify a part of the chip to examine in order to determine the cause of failure. Traditional fault diagnosis compares the observed faulty behavior to behaviors predicted by a chosen fault model and fault simulator. As identified by Aitken and Maxwell <ref> [4] </ref>, the problem has been approached in two ways: via a simple fault model (almost always the single stuck-at model) and a sophisticated matching algorithm, or a more accurate fault model (such as a bridging fault model) and a comparatively simple matching algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Previously we presented a technique that offers the precision of an accurate model approach using only simple model information <ref> [10] </ref>. This paper presents an adaptation of the middle-ground method to overcome a primary weakness of accurate model approaches; the resulting technique is not only precise, it is robust. It provides high-quality diagnoses of bridging faults, even when the bridging fault's behavior is unpredictable. <p> The plot has curves for three sets of samples: original MMA composite signatures, our composite signatures using only stuck-at signature information to restrict (drop) non-detecting vec 7 tors, and our composite signatures when information from a logic simulator is used to restrict vectors <ref> [10] </ref>. As the curves indicate, improvements arising from additional information reduce the size of the signatures and decrease the variance. For example, for the leftmost curve, the average number of composite signature bits is 88.8; the mean and median distance between sampled composite signature pairs is 165.

Because of the manner of construction of a composite signature, there are clear indications which should be more important in the diagnosis procedure.

Reference-contexts: Note that a diagnosis does not require explicit simulation of bridging faults. We have previously published an improvement to the technique of Millman, McCluskey, and Acken that continues to use only single stuck-at information but improves on the original technique in three ways: considering only realistic bridges <ref> [12] </ref>, incorporating match restriction (flagging some vectors as incapable of detecting a particular bridging fault), and incorporating match requirement (flagging some vectors as dependably detecting a particular bridging fault). fault candidate for node X bridged with node Y; it shows how the candidate is composed of the four single stuck-at behaviors

Reference-contexts: In order to answer that question, we executed a number of diagnostic trials designed to evaluate the technique. To get a statistically valid sample of potential input for the trials, we first generated observed faulty behaviors for the 10% most likely bridging faults, as determined by Inductive Fault Analysis <ref> [15] </ref>, for each of the MCNC layouts of the ISCAS-85 circuits [5].

Reference-contexts: In contrast, a more accurate fault model will ideally point directly to the site of the defect|perhaps even suggesting the process step at which the defect was introduced <ref> [16] </ref>. Because, when using a simple model approach, the candidates do not directly correspond to the expected failure mechanisms, a sophisticated matching technique is required to produce a diagnosis [17].

Reference-contexts: Because, when using a simple model approach, the candidates do not directly correspond to the expected failure mechanisms, a sophisticated matching technique is required to produce a diagnosis <ref> [17] </ref>. Conversely, for sophisticated models, because observed behavior is expected to correspond very closely to modeled behavior, only simple matching algorithms are used to produce a diagnosis. For either diagnosis approach, the list of faults that best explain the response of the faulty circuit is the diagnosis.

A composite signature containing errors that are a su-perset of the errors contained in the observed faulty behavior is said to be a match. The diagnosis of a bridging fault is the list of matches.
