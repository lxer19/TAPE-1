Abstract: Performing the complex task of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) requires a break-down of the task-complexity to enable the possibility of performing the KDD-task. Since even more techniques will appear in the future that can solve a variety of KDD-problems, a domain expert that wants to analyse his domain should have the means to work with tools that integrate several of these techniques as well as the techniques themselves. In this paper a framework is proposed for a strategy component that is to be used for a KDD-system that can guide users in breaking down the complexity of a typical KDD-task and supports him in selecting and using several ML-techniques. The goals of such a guidance component are reuse of (predefined) taskcomponents in order to decrease development time and to simplify the process of decomposing a KDD-task, task-oriented planning in order to break down complexity of a typical KDD-task and supporting post-processing (evaluation) of KDD-processes. The question whether there is a need for user-guidance or not is already answered by several studies mentioned in the literature (see i.e. (Consortium 1993), (Mla-deni^c 1995), (Ram & Hunter 1992), (Hunter 1995)). The answer to the "how" question is not so easily answered. There are several approaches that provide a kind of user-support, but a real guidance of a user that helps planning KDD-processes by building up task-decompositions according to the users intentions and fl This work has been partially funded by the Daimler Benz AG, Research & Technology, project no. 096 4 965047 1 E B.

Reference-contexts: Every task in the KDD-solution of figure 1 has its assumptions about the (meta-) knowledge it needs and about the output it can deliver. Being too specific does not help us much w.r.t. reuse, and being too general neither (a well- known trade-off in Software Engineering <ref> (Kruger 1992) </ref>). The overall task of our example approach is decomposed in three steps at the first level of decomposition.

Certainly as even more tools will become available to perform data mining, tools that help users selecting and using the right tools for their problems should become available.
