Abstract: This paper aims to examine the use of genetic algorithms to optimize subsystems of cellular neural network architectures. The application at hand is character recognition: the aim is to evolve an optimal feature detector in order to aid a conventional classifier network to generalize across different fonts. To this end, a performance function and a genetic encoding for a feature detector are presented. An experiment is described where an optimal feature detector is indeed found by the genetic algorithm. We are interested in the application of cellular neural networks in computer vision. Genetic algorithms (GA's) [1-3] can serve to optimize the design of cellular neural networks. Although the design of the global architecture of the system could still be done by human insight, we propose that specific sub-modules of the system are best optimized using one or other optimization method. GAs are a good candidate to fulfill this optimization role, as they are well suited to problems where the objective function is a complex function of many parameters. The specific problem we want to investigate is one of character recognition. More specifically, we would like to use the GA to find optimal feature detectors to be used in the recognition of digits .
