Abstract: Results, Performance Notes Work is in progress to increase the grammar available in the module file. Syntax permitting if-else statements and path ordering are two examples of new syntax not described in this paper. Results, Performance Notes The Modules package is quite new and is still under development. Only a few of our users have begun working in the Modules environment. They have been very pleased with the package and the benefits it provides. Currently, it takes a second or two to load a module into the current shell. In an effort to improve this performance, it is possible for the user to specify that the internal functions remain resident from one module(1) command to the next. This provides a marked improvement in speed since the functions are not being completely redefined upon every invocation.

Reference-contexts: Finally, more options are under development to provide users with even greater control over how their environment is constructed by the Modules package. In some cases, users dont want a variable modified when loading a certain module file. For example, if the OpenWindows <ref> [3] </ref> dynamic libraries are already cached using ldconfig (8)[1] the LD_LIBRARY_PATH should not be modified when loading the openwin module file. Other configuration and control options are being added for more experienced users as well. Results, Performance Notes The Modules package is quite new and is still under development.
