Abstract: In this paper we address the issues related to the delivery of multimedia streams on local area networks. Multimedia integrates voice and video along with text and images into existing systems. Local area networks were designed to handle regular data traffic which are bursty in nature and for which variable delay is acceptable. Multimedia traffic, on the other hand, requires constant delay in addition to fast (or real time) delivery. Multimedia traffic also requires large amount of bandwidth compared to regular traffic. Since local area networks are widely in use, their modification to integrate multimedia streams is very important. In our work we consider some possible solutions to the problems associated with multimedia on local area networks as well as studying the performance aspects of these solutions.

Reference-contexts: However it requires a massive amounts of storage, for example, a 640 x 480 display takes about 900KB of memory. With the multimedia requirement of instantaneous display time, this system may not be adequate <ref> [6] </ref>. The amount of memory required can be reduced by using a color map which is a limited size table that contains an entry for each of the set of colors that can be displayed simultaneously.

Reference-contexts: This technique works by storing only the variations between successive frames. The 27MBps transfer rate required for the 640 x 480 screen would be reduced to 550kBps using MPEG1. MPEG1 can also compress audio by a 5-10 factor <ref> [7] </ref>. 5 Communication Network Background 5.1 Local Area Networks Local area networks (LAN) exists in one of the following architectures; bus, tree, token ring and FDDI (Fiber Dual Data Interface) ring. The most widely used LAN is the Ethernet which is a bus based architecture.

Reference-contexts: Other options include using FDDI (running over twisted pair for a short distance) to increase the bandwidth to 100 Mbps. FDDI technology could be extended to support the timely delivery required by multimedia applications. Isochronous Ethernet is another option which provides isochronous channels to stations equipped with isoENET cards <ref> [10] </ref>. 5.2 Switching Networks Switching networks transfer information between source and destination via three functions: transmission, multiplexing, and switching. Transmission provides the point-to-point transfer of information. Multiplexing uses a single transmission facility (link) for several independent channels.

Reference-contexts: In cell switching technology, a cell is a 53 byte fixed length packet with 5 bytes for header (containing routing and quality of service information) and 48 bytes for data (payload section) <ref> [11] </ref>. This fixed length cells are better suited for high speed switching because it enables simpler implementation of switches and provides predictable system behavior. The asynchronous nature of ATM comes from the fact that cells are assigned asynchronously to any service based on its needs.

Reference-contexts: A software solution is one who can be fully implemented without any additional hardware equipments. We focus our attention to the problems associated with supporting multimedia traffic on with local area bus (Ethernet) as opposed to token ring networks <ref> [12] </ref>. 6.1 A Two-Priority Scheme The current medium access bus protocol does not provide priority for transfer of data. Stations on the bus use the CSMA/CD protocol to compete for bus bandwidth. This means packets can indiscriminately collide and get retransmitted.
