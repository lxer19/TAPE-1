Reference-contexts: There is a more general symmetry which is possessed by any constrained Hamiltonian system. This symmetry was found by Batalin and Vilkovisky <ref> [7] </ref>. The first step in the construction of the BRS symmetry is the enlargement of the phase space of the dynamical system.

Reference-contexts: For this purpose the phase space BRS transformation is most useful. 1.6 BRS Symmetry and the BFV Path Integral The existence of a global fermionic symmetry in gauge-fixed Yang-Mills theories was discovered by Becchi, Rouet, and Stora <ref> [8] </ref> and independently by Tyutin [55].

Reference-contexts: The null vectors A are useful for separating these constraints covariantly [36,38]. Contrary to the claims of reference <ref> [9] </ref>, one may check that the first-class constraints are separated covariantly from the second-class constraints by F A := D A fl A 0 ; A = 1; 2; (3:23a) The bar over the label A in (3.23b) is to denote the other value A may take; that is 1 =

Reference-contexts: This follows from the fact that lim F (t + x S ) = lim F (t) (B:16) holds for all smooth functions F and all finite x S 2 R c . By contrast, the integral over anticommuting numbers is a simpler operation. This integral, the Berezin integral <ref> [10] </ref>, is motivated not by measure theoretical ideas but by simple consideration of the properties one would like such an integral to have.

Reference-contexts: can be obtained from a consideration of the classical Dirac electron and its quantization, which not only contains classically anticommuting variables but also has second-class constraints. 2.2 The Dirac Electron The first classical action for the Dirac electron using anticommuting, or Grass mann variables, was written by Berezin and Marinov <ref> [11] </ref>. S = dt [m _x 2 + 2 In this action the variables ~ ; ~ 5 and are anticommuting while x is commuting. The notation u is a shorthand for _x = p _x 2 .

Reference-contexts: The second chapter starts from the example of the bosonic particle and continues with the examination of the Dirac electron and the various manifestly supersymmetric particle theories. In particular it is shown that the superparticle theories of Brink and Schwarz <ref> [16] </ref> and Siegel [52] are inequivalent. The Brink-Schwarz superparticle is shown to be the Wess-Zumino scalar multiplet in four spacetime dimensions. The ten dimensional Brink-Schwarz superparticle, which has resisted covariant quantization since 1981, is reduced to a system which is covariant and should be quantizable in a covariant form. <p> The first such action is the one written by Casalbuoni [17] without a one-dimensional metric on the world-line and by Brink 37 and Schwarz <ref> [16] </ref>: S BS = 1 Z Here e is the "einbein" which takes the role of the metric tensor on the world-line.

Reference-contexts: This is because on shell the A are null and the equations of motion already have the vanishing of half of the gauge conditions (3.54). It is problematical to translate the gauge condition (3.54) into canonical form (an attempt is made in reference <ref> [18] </ref>), but it is perhaps the most natural covariant gauge choice. The gauge condition (3.54) has been treated in the Lagrangian formalism by Kallosh [39], who has to introduce two arbitrary null vectors in order to fix the gauge.

Reference-contexts: This has yet to be checked. 74 To explain the second idea, we must digress to a discussion of the equations of motion for the Green-Schwarz string.

It turns out that there is a gauge choice one may make which also implies that the equations of motion are free.

Reference-contexts: The BRS charge is, in general, not unique. All the possible BRS charges are unitarily equivalent <ref> [34] </ref>. <p> In most cases it is 17 fairly easy to obtain these extra pieces from the requirement that and H BRS satisfy fH BRS ; g = f; g = 0. The existence of the extra pieces for a general dynamical system was demonstrated in reference <ref> [34] </ref> where a general procedure for calculating them is given also. To each variable a quantity called ghost number may be assigned. The original degrees of freedom, q i and p j , are assigned ghost number zero. <p> From the structure of the BRS charge, = c + n1 it is immediately obvious that each of the following sets of boundary conditions makes 19 vanish <ref> [34] </ref>. (i) c = b = = (p) = 0; (iii) c = c = = 0: One may also check that the second condition of (1.50) is satisfied by each of the conditions (1.52). <p> The other conditions of (1.53) are easier to use in practice. Having in hand BRS invariant boundary conditions, we now turn to the Fradkin-Vilkovisky theorem which asserts that the path integral (1.46) is independent of the gauge fixing function . Following Henneaux <ref> [34] </ref>, we prove the independence of Z under infinitesimal changes of . 20 Let z denote all canonical variables in the extended phase space.

Reference-contexts: Again, because the classical string actions are singular systems, their quantization begins with the analysis of their constraints. A canonical analysis of the manifestly supersymmetric string was first begun by Hori and Kamimura <ref> [36] </ref> who recognized most of the relevant features of the system. It is more useful to use a path integral quantization of the system because it eliminates some of the problems of ordering in the canonical formalism and also yields the ghost parts of the action. <p> It turns out <ref> [36] </ref> that the generator of reparametrizations is not purely 2 A but is 1 A + 2 () A D A A 0 full set of constraints for the Green-Schwarz string is (P g ) fffi 0; T A := 1 A + 2 () A D A A 0 F <p> The constraints (3.49) must also be conserved and so fix the Hamiltonian to be <ref> [36] </ref> H = 1 1 1 0 The whole set of constraints (3.49) and (3.24) are all together second- class constraints as they must be since (3.49) fix the gauge completely. The generating functional (3.46) may be used to quantize the theory.

Reference-contexts: In order to preserve the algebra (3.40), we must order the constraints as follows. p 2 ! ^p 2 ; pq ! 1 (3:41) Imposing these operators on a wavefunction leads to the conclusion that the wave-function must vanish. It has been verified explicitly <ref> [40] </ref> that the same conclusion holds for the set of constraints (3.32) of the Siegel string modification. The BFV formalism may not be applied to the system (3.39) directly because the constraints are reducible.

Reference-contexts: This is accomplished through the introduction of extra variables into superspace. The third chapter opens with a discussion of the bosonic string and reproduces the gauge-fixed Polyakov path integral <ref> [48] </ref> from the BFV path integral. From there the Green-Schwarz [30,31] and Siegel [53] actions for the superstring are analyzed and shown to be essentially equivalent. Finally, the problems of covariant quantization of the theories are discussed and a formal quantization is proposed. 3 I. <p> T (%))ffi 0 ( %); (3:5) The non-zero structure functions are "constants" given by 2ffi 0 ( %) and the constraints are obviously first-class. 55 Another action for the bosonic string is that given by Brink, Di Vecchia and Howe [14] and Deser and Zumino [19] and promoted by Polyakov <ref> [48] </ref>. The "Polyakov" action is quadratic in the fields X and would therefore seem to be the more appropriate action to describe the system quantum mechanically. To write the action, we introduce the metric, g fffi , on the world sheet of the string.

Reference-contexts: Ultimately, one would like to use this "first quantization" to construct appropriate "second quantized" field theories. In this case the free second quantized theory should be constructed so that its classical solutions yield precisely the physical states specified by the physical state condition (2.6). Following Siegel <ref> [51] </ref> we postulate that the action is S = d 4 x dc b K; (2:15) where b K is a differential operator chosen so that the action is invariant under un-physical changes state ! + b . <p> The dynamical variables, including ghosts and auxiliary fields, of the first-quantized string become the coordinates on which the string field depends. And, as Siegel has explained <ref> [51] </ref>, the constraints of the first-quantized theory will determine the free dynamics of the string field. The free field Lagrangian is ^ H, with ^ H the first-quantized Hamiltonian (operator) and the string field.

The ten dimensional Brink-Schwarz superparticle, which has resisted covariant quantization since 1981, is reduced to a system which is covariant and should be quantizable in a covariant form. <p> It would be ideal, then, if one could do away with the second-class problems and also have a manifestly covariant gauge choice. This was the idea of Siegel when he proposed the action <ref> [52] </ref> S Siegel = Z 2 gP 2 + _ + P= ]: (2:62) This action, excepting the last two terms, is the first-order form of the massless Brink-Schwarz action (2.52).

Reference-contexts: This is accomplished through the introduction of extra variables into superspace. The third chapter opens with a discussion of the bosonic string and reproduces the gauge-fixed Polyakov path integral [48] from the BFV path integral. From there the Green-Schwarz [30,31] and Siegel <ref> [53] </ref> actions for the superstring are analyzed and shown to be essentially equivalent. Finally, the problems of covariant quantization of the theories are discussed and a formal quantization is proposed. 3 I. <p> One should keep in mind, therefore, the possibility that the Green-Schwarz action is not the appropriate action for quantization and may need to be amended in whole or in part. One such possible action has been proposed by Siegel <ref> [53] </ref>. The motivation for the Siegel modification is to incorporate the smallest algebra containing the generators of reparametrizations and of local fermionic transformations as the invariance algebra of the string. <p> The set of constraints (3.27), (3.28), and (3.29) are conserved without the imposition of any further constraints. The set of fixing conditions (3.28) is consistent and leaves an algebra <ref> [53] </ref> of constraints generated by 9;10;11;12 .

Reference-contexts: For this purpose the phase space BRS transformation is most useful. 1.6 BRS Symmetry and the BFV Path Integral The existence of a global fermionic symmetry in gauge-fixed Yang-Mills theories was discovered by Becchi, Rouet, and Stora [8] and independently by Tyutin <ref> [55] </ref>. There is a more general symmetry which is possessed by any constrained Hamiltonian system. This symmetry was found by Batalin and Vilkovisky [7]. The first step in the construction of the BRS symmetry is the enlargement of the phase space of the dynamical system. <p> fl + X b ff n b ff 1 ff 1 ff n + b ff ff : (1:41) The BRS charge , discovered by Batalin and Vilkovisky [7], generates the canonical version of the global fermionic symmetry discovered in Yang-Mills theories by Becchi, Rouet and Stora [8] and Tyutin <ref> [55] </ref>. The BRS charge is, in general, not unique. All the possible BRS charges are unitarily equivalent [34].
