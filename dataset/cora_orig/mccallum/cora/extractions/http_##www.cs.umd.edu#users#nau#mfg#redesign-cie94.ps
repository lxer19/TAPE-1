Abstract: All mechanical designs pass through a series of formal and informal redesign steps, involving the analysis of functionality, manufacturability, cost and other life-cycle factors. The speed and efficacy of these steps has a major influence on the lead time of the product from conceptualization to launching. In this paper we propose a methodology for automatically generating redesign suggestions for reducing setup costs for machined parts. Our approach is based on interpreting the design as a collection of machinable features. Our methodology generates alternate machining features by making geometric changes to the part, and adds them to the feature set of the original part. The designer may provide restrictions indicating that certain surfaces and volumes should not be changed, in which case all redesign suggestions generated by our approach honor those restrictions. Using features from the extended feature set generated above, one or more new designs may be found that need fewer setups than the original part.

Reference-contexts: For Example, if f is a blind pocket and f 0 is a drilling fea ture, then machine f 0 before f . 3. Precedence constraints also arise from preferred manufacturing practices. Some examples are given below; more such cases are enumerated in <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. (a) if f is an end-milling feature with at least one side open and f 0 a drilling feature then machine f before f 0 ; (b) if f is a slot-milling feature and f 0 is a drilling feature, then machine f before f 0 ; (c) if

Reference-contexts: For net shape manufacturing operations such as stamping, injection molding, and sheet metal working, several works on manufacturability evaluation and modification have been reported in the literature. For example, Lazaro et al. have developed a methodology which finds violations of design-for-manufacturing rules for sheet-metal parts <ref> [3] </ref>. From a library of suggestions, it displays hints for modifying the design. Similar methods are also used by others [9, 16, 15, 10]. Complete redesigned parts are not suggested in any of these cases, but suggestions are provided for avoiding manufacturability problems detected by the domain specific manufacturability evaluator.

Reference-contexts: This step in described in Section 4. Step 1: Analyze the current design. Step 1a. Find all the possible machining features in the original part P which can be removed from the stock S to produce P (for details, see <ref> [4] </ref>). Put all these features into the set F . Step 1b. Find the precedence constraints on the order in which the features in F can be machined, as described in Section 5. Step 1c. <p> To determine how many setups will be required, we need to know what these features are. In <ref> [14, 4] </ref>, we describe an algorithm for extracting from the solid model of the part all the machining features which can be used to create these faces.

Reference-contexts: As an example, Figure 3 shows some of the end milling, slot milling, and drilling features for the part P1. F is the set of all machining features f that could potentially be used in generating P from S; for details see <ref> [5] </ref>. For the part P1, Figure 3 shows some of the features in F . An FBM (feature-based model) F F is a set of machining features such that subtracting F from the stock S produces the part P and F does not contain any redundant feature (s).

Reference-contexts: They also defined some functions to modify the parts on the basis of these analysis. These functions work on the basis of splitting, combining or perturbing components. Hayes, Desa and Wright <ref> [6] </ref> reported some advances in the direction of making redesign suggestions based on process planning knowledge. They did a protocol study to analyze the working methodology of experienced process planners, and used the results of this analysis to formulate modifications in mechanical designs. <p> We generate additional alternative features, and then select features that cover the functionality labels. In contrast to approaches (e.g., <ref> [6] </ref>) that analyze a single operation plan setup by setup to decide on which setups can be removed or combined, our approach works on a more global level, considering alternative operation plans and alternative setups. 3.

Reference-contexts: Hsu, Lee and Su <ref> [7] </ref> reported redesigning of components for assembly from three major criteria: parallelism, assem-blability and redundancy. They also defined some functions to modify the parts on the basis of these analysis. These functions work on the basis of splitting, combining or perturbing components.

Reference-contexts: In general, a single part may have several different FBMs, and thus there may be several different ways to machine the part. 3. RELATED WORK One of the first attempts at generating redesign suggestions was by Jakiela et al. <ref> [8] </ref>. Their work concentrated on automating the Boothroyd and Dewhurst design for assembly methods.

Reference-contexts: A workpiece is the intermediate object produced by performing zero or more of the operations needed to create P . To represent P and S, we use geometric solids (cf. <ref> [11] </ref>). For example, part would typically be machined from a rectangular piece of stock. A machining feature is a portion of the workpiece affected by a particular machining operation.

Mantyla <ref> [12] </ref> et al. developed some process planning techniques based on the concept of feature relaxation. They suggested leaving unimportant portions of the design intentionally incomplete. This allowed them to use different operations and build the part geometry based on the operations which would be more convenient to use.

Reference-contexts: Instead, our approach is based on the observation that the part to be manufactured is typically a component of a larger assembly, and most functional requirements will involve how the part interacts with other portions of the assembly <ref> [13] </ref>.
