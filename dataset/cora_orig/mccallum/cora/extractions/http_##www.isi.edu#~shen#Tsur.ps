Abstract: This paper presents an overview of data mining techniques in the context of of the deductive-inductive cycle model. The claim made in this paper is that a combination of both of these modes of inference in one model offers adavantages over the exclusive use of either induction or deduction. After an introduction of the model, the paper describes an architecture of the Knowledge Miner environment and its relation to the LDL++ deductive database technology. In particular, it defines the notion of a meta query and shows how this concept can be used to take advantage of the full power of a deductive data base system. The paper mentions a number of inductive methods that can be used within this framework and describes some data mining experiments performed with the Knowledge Miner.

Reference-contexts: next section we will provide a brief overview of the LDL++ system, which is used to implement the deductive (elaboration and database) part of the Knowledge Miner|a Database Mining Environment [SOZ94, SOZ95], that will be described in the sequel. 3.1 The LDL++ Deductive Database Sys tem LDL++ Deductive Database System <ref> [AOTZ] </ref>, is the successor to the LDL system that was built at MCC, Austin, TX. In its design, the system has benefited extensively from the experience gained with the previous system and its architecture is depicted in Fig. 2.

Reference-contexts: Among the more common methods employed we list the following: * Classification: partitioning the result of the deductive query into subsets; see e.g., Quin lan [Qui86]. * Abstraction: deriving higher-level concepts from the results of the deductive query; see Han et al [HCC93] and Dhar and Tuzhilin <ref> [DT93] </ref>. A third method is Bayesian Clustering, which is employed in the Knowledge Miner. We elaborate on this method in the next section. 5.1 Bayesian Clustering An example of Bayesian Clustering [SOZ95] is that of data mining in a large database of chemical compounds, their ingredients and their physical properties.

Reference-contexts: One of our objectives is to present these ideas in a uniform and consistent fashion. We will develop therefore a model of the database mining process that can be used for this purpose. Matheus et al <ref> [MCPS93] </ref> describe a generic architecture for Knowledge Discovery in Databases. In their scheme, high-level patterns are translated to database queries which are executed and return results. Subsequently, the results are focused, analyzed for existing patterns, evaluated and returned as discoveries.

Reference-contexts: The choice of the method depends on the purpose of the data mining operation.
