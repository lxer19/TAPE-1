Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The detection of roads in satellite images is a difficult topic for which several methods have been tested and sometimes specially developed. Problems of resolution, noise, blurring, and image understanding are involved essentially. <ref> [Des 86] </ref> uses Mathematical Morphology and top-hat transforms in particular for detecting roads. [Graf 89] performs Deriche edge detection followed by probabilistic edge prolongation. [Ser 89] detects agglomerations with Mathematical Morphology and roads with dynamic programming, but her approach faces problems of convergence and rightness, and deals with them with thresholds

Reference-contexts: We extend in this work, done partially at the INRIA-Sophia Antipolis, the algorithm of F* <ref> [Fis 81] </ref>, based on dynamic programming and commonly considered as giving the best results in road detection. In this report, we will first present a mathematical formalization of the algorithm and an extension to cliques of order higher than two, to take into account the contrast between roads and background. <p> However, we should stress : * We have presented a mathematical formalization of the notions involved. In particular we have shown that the image obtained by integrating the cost is a distance function, and defined the cost as a potential on a clique. 6 DISCUSSION 28 * While Fischler <ref> [Fis 81] </ref> defines the cost relatively to one point, we define it relatively to a couple of points (and theoretically relatively to more points) it corresponds to the segment between the two points. <p> The distance formalization allows this generalization. * The organization of the scannings in <ref> [Fis 81] </ref> is not optimal : there is a redundancy of computation for some directions (for each of the two horizontal directions left/right and right/left, the minimization is performed twice in the same cycle of scannings). In our algorithm, we solve this problem : 1.

Reference-contexts: For this, we simply have to define the corresponding local potential. We may notice that these developments stress the connection between important notions, such as distance and energy, global information and local information, graphs and energy (see <ref> [Gau 92] </ref> for another interesting connection between graph, energy and distance, in 6 DISCUSSION 29 a completely different context). Besides, we may see the importance of non-stationary energies and potentials, for instance for features whose characteristics vary according to the location in the image.

Reference-contexts: Another classical method of edge detection is the snake method <ref> [Kas 87] </ref>. The applications are quite different. The snakes in particular deal with the problem of movement of a contour through time, and with the detection of virtual contours, which is out of the field of applications of our attraction energy.

Reference-contexts: Our distance develops this notion by taking into account not only a function of the grey-level but also the local direction of the path or the contrast. 6.2.3 Graph theory and dynamic programming Other methods have extracted the information of minimum-cost paths in image processing <ref> [Mar 72] </ref>[Har 68]. They used a cost function of the contrast and then performed a heuristic search in a graph for detecting minimum cost paths.

Reference-contexts: of order higher than two, * we do not use a special structure for the graph, but work directly on the image, and thus avoid the computational problems, 6 DISCUSSION 27 * we do not take the risk of defining and using a global heuristic (it is worth noting that <ref> [Mar 76] </ref> used a threshold as a heuristic : grey-level information had to be added in this way to the contrast information used in the cost but the information added was once again based on a thresholding...), * we are sure to find a minimum cost path.

Thus, our first algorithm <ref> [Mer 91] </ref> is an adaptation of Ford's algorithm [For 56][For 62] to image processing. <p> Since may take into account wished tolerances (such as allowed deviations and maximal length admitted for the interruptions), and since it may be computed automatically from the histogram, we managed in previous applications not presented in this work <ref> [Mer 91] </ref> to obtain a robust potential for a whole class of applications (such as recognizing the staves in a music score, recognizing the brain fissure in MRI medical images).
