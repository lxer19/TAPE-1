Abstract: We propose a simple cell scheduling mechanism for ATM networks. The proposed mechanism, named Carry-Over Round Robin (CORR), is an extension of weighted round robin scheduling. We show that albeit its simplicity, CORR achieves tight bounds on end-to-end delay and near perfect fairness. Using a variety of video traffic traces we show that CORR often outperforms some of the more complex scheduling disciplines such as Packet-by-Packet Generalized Processor Sharing (PGPS).

Reference-contexts: We have derived tight bounds on end-to-end delay achieved by CORR. Our derivation of delay bounds does not assume a specific traffic arrival pattern. Hence, unlike PGPS (which assumes leaky-bucket <ref> [4] </ref> controlled sources) we can derive end-to-end delay bounds for CORR for almost any traffic source. Using traffic traces from real life video sources we have shown that CORR often performs better than PGPS in terms of number of connections admitted.

Reference-contexts: This is an involved process (we use linear programming techniques) and requires a full scan of the entire traffic trace for each source. Refer to <ref> [13] </ref> for a description of this procedure. We have plotted the ratio of the number of connections admitted by CORR used in conjunction with single and dual leaky bucket shapers with that of PGPS under this best case scenario.

Reference-contexts: Another important difference between CORR and frame based schemes, such as SG and HRR, is that CORR is a work conserving service discipline. It does not waste the spare capacity of the system; rather it shares excess capacity fairly among active connections. A recent paper <ref> [14] </ref> concurrently proposed a similar idea for efficient implementation of fair queuing. They show that with a simple modification, round robin scheduling can achieve a high degree of fairness in allocating bandwidth among competing connections. They have made a strong case for using such a mechanism in Internet router.
