Abstract: Robotic soccer involves multiple agents that need to collaborate in an adversarial environment to achieve specific objectives. In this paper, we describe the robotic agents and architecture that we have developed to enter RoboCup-97. The framework integrates high-level and low-level reasoning as an overall wireless communication system of small-size robots, an overhead vision camera for perception, a centralized interface computer, and several clients as the minds of the robot players. We present the mobile robot platform specifications, the different communication servers and links, the vision processing algorithm, and the control code that enables strategic collabora tion between teammates.

Reference-contexts: Attackers pass or shoot based on the maximum of the values returned for their different potential receivers and for their own shots. 6 Conclusion The engineering present within this system represents a significant improvement over our previous implementation in many respects <ref> [ Achim et al., 1996 ] </ref> . The vision processing is at least 5 times faster; the robots move faster and more smoothly; and the behaviors are more complex and effective.

Reference-contexts: Systems with on-board and off-board types have appeared in recent years. All have found that the reactiveness of soccer robots requires real-time vision processing. However, due to rich visual input, researchers have found that dedicated processors or even DSPs are often needed <ref> [ Sahota et al., 1995; Asada et al., 1996 ] </ref> . Our approach to such a problem is more simplistic. We have acquired a fast framegrabber board that can perform visual captures at frame rate.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we describe the robots' mechanisms for action selection and strategic coordination. 5.1 Reactive Control We use close loop reactive control for the low level movement of our robots. The control strategy follows a modified version of a simple Braitenburg vehicle <ref> [ Braitenburg, 1984 ] </ref> . The Braitenburg love vehicle defines a reactive control mechanism that directs a differentially driven robot to a certain destination point (goal). We require a similar behavior for our robots.

Reference-contexts: Like real soccer players, it is often useful and necessary to have the ability to predict future locations of the ball (or even the players). We have utilized a Kalman filter for such a purpose <ref> [ Han and Veloso, 1997 ] </ref> . The Kalman filter is very suitable for such a purpose since the detection of ball's location is noisy.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the system described here was designed specifically for RoboCup97 in which several robotic teams from around the world are competing on an "even playing field." <ref> [ Kitano et al., 1997 ] </ref> . The scientific opportunities involved in this effort are enormous. Our particular scientific focus is on Multiagent Systems coupled with collaborative and adversarial learning in an environment that requires real-time dynamic planning.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction As robots become more adept at operating in the real world, the high-level issues of collaborative and adversarial planning and learning in real-time situations are becoming more important. An interesting emerging domain that is particularly appropriate for studying these issues is Robotic Soccer. Although realistic simulation environments exist <ref> [ Noda, 1995; Sahota, 1993 ] </ref> and are useful, it is important to have some actual physical agents in order to address the full complexity of the task. Robotic Soccer is an exciting domain for Intelligent Robotics for many reasons. <p> Our particular scientific focus is on Multiagent Systems coupled with collaborative and adversarial learning in an environment that requires real-time dynamic planning. Along with the real robot competition, RoboCup97 will also include a simulator-based tournament using the Soccer Server system designed by Noda <ref> [ Noda, 1995 ] </ref> . While we continue working on our real-world system, we have been concurrently developing learning techniques in simulation [ Stone and Veloso, 1997; 1996 ] . We eventually hope to transfer these learning techniques to the real system as we develop a complete Robotic Soccer architecture.

This paper describes the overall architecture of our robotic soccer system. <p> The Kalman filter takes into account the existence of such noise and gives a best estimate. 5 The Robot Control Code The robot control code itself consists of several different behavior levels as summarized in Figure 2 <ref> [ Stone and Veloso, 1997 ] </ref> . First, there is reactive control code which enables the robot to move to a goal location|either a fixed position on the field or a moving target such as the ball.

Reference-contexts: By engineering the input scene in an appropriate man-ner, we found that a fast general purpose processor (a 166MHz Pentium processor) is adequate for the task. 4.1 Detection and Association Following the techniques used by many teams in MIROSOT <ref> [ Stone et al., 1996 ] </ref> , we have decided to use color as a cue for the vision system to detect. This color-based system allows the use of fixed color space thresholds to segment the different colors into regions. <p> The vision processing is at least 5 times faster; the robots move faster and more smoothly; and the behaviors are more complex and effective. Although several 3-robot teams have been implemented in the past <ref> [ Stone et al., 1996 ] </ref> , the system described in the paper is among the first implemented 5-robot teams (along with several of the other RoboCup-97 entries). Having the two additional robots enables several more interesting and effective multiagent behaviors than were previously possible.
