Abstract: In this overview we briefly describe a collection of tools developed at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) for aiding users in specifying database structures and in querying databases using object-oriented concepts on top of commercial relational database management systems. These tools are based on an Extended Entity-Relationship (EER) model and allow users to deal with concise EER structures and queries rather than relational database definitions and queries which are usually large, hard to maintain, and involve terms that obscure the semantics of the application. Using the LBL/EER database tools users are insulated from the underlying database management system, and thus can avoid learning database management specific concepts and query languages.

Reference-contexts: The EER query editor and translator are presented in section 5. Section 6 contains some concluding remarks. 2 2 Data Model and Query language Underlying the LBL/EER Database Tools The concepts of the Entity-Relationship (ER) model have been defined originally in <ref> [1] </ref>. Subsequently, several extensions of this model (e.g., [14]) as well as several ER-based query languages (e.g., [2], [8], [12]) have been proposed.

Reference-contexts: Such tools have been developed at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL), based on a version of the Extended Entity-Relationship (EER) model. Although numerous database tools are commercially available (e.g., see <ref> [3] </ref>), they fail to provide one or more of the following capabilities: (i) support for constructs, such as generalization and aggregation, that are essential for specifying semantically rich database schemas, (ii) generation of complete DBMS database definition, including referential integrity and domain constraints; (iii) query capabilities at the same (high) level

Reference-contexts: The version of the Extended Entity-Relationship (EER) schema constructs and query language underlying the LBL/EER tools are briefly discussed bellow; they follow with slight modifications and extensions the definitions presented by us in <ref> [9] </ref> and [10], respectively. 2.1 Extended Entity-Relationship Schemas An EER schema consists of entity-sets (e.g., EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT) and of entity-set associations. An entity-set (e.g., EMPLOYEE) can be associated with another entity-set (e.g., DEPARTMENT) either directly, by a HAS association (e.g., EMPLOYEE HAS DEPARTMENT), or using a relationship-set (e.g., WORKS IN). <p> ERVALS has been developed using C and X11/Motif. Once the EER schema has been defined, the SDT translator maps it into database definitions for commercial relational DBMSs. 9 10 3.2 EER Schema Definition and Translation Tool Our approach to translating EER schemas into relational database schemas, as discussed in <ref> [9] </ref>, is to separate the translation process into several independent stages, such as normalization, assigning names to relational attributes and merging relations. The modularity of this approach allows easy modifications and extensions of SDT. SDT works in two main stages. <p> The research related to these tools is described in several papers pub lished in scientific journals and conference proceedings <ref> [4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10] </ref>. Reference manuals are available as LBL reports [11, 13]. ERDRAW and SDT are used by over 35 database de velopment groups worldwide. ERVALS and the COQL tools have been released only recently and are used by several groups.

COQL supports both attribute and relationship inheritance. <p> The research related to these tools is described in several papers pub lished in scientific journals and conference proceedings <ref> [4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10] </ref>.
