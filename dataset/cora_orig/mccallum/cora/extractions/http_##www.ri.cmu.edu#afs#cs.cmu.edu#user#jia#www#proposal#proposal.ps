Abstract: In the absence of vision, grasping an object often relies on tactile feedback from the fingertips. Many robotic tasks such as automated assembly specify geometric models of the objects involved. The object geometry, combined with the mechanics of simple manipulation operations, may lead to grasp strategies that are reliable, efficient, and easily implementable. These strategies may also be preferred in some situations where visual guidance is available. I propose to investigate such "blind" grasping in the presence of Coulomb friction. More specifically, my thesis work will consist of three phases: pose determination, grasp achievement, and regrasp planning. The thesis will focus on the two-dimensional ver sion of the problem which is representative of many real tasks. The three-dimensional version is left as an optional extension. In the first phase, I have been working on the problem of determining the pose of a known object with a small amount of pushing by a fingertip. Assuming sliding friction in the plane, a dynamic analysis of pushing has resulted in a numerical algorithm that computes the object pose from three instantaneous contact positions on the fingertip during the pushing. Simulations and experiments (with an Adept robot) have been con ducted to demonstrate the sensing feasibility. This sensing approach is to be extended to incorporate contact friction between the fingertip and the object. The second phase of my thesis work will explore strategies for attaining force-closure grasps with one or more additional fingertips. In particular, I will develop strategies in which the fingertips are guaranteed to slide along the object boundary towards locations admitting force-closure grasps. Such a strategy would keep the object constrained by the fingertips during the motion; hence it would be quite reliable. The third phase of the thesis will consider fingertip motion planning for regrasps. In both phases, I will look into the mechanics of multifinger manipulation (under sliding and contact friction), the computational issues of grasp/regrasp planning, and the integration of sensing and grasping.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [5] </ref>, Bicchi proves the equivalence of force-closure with the study of the equilibria of an ordinary differential equation, which results in an efficient algorithm for testing force-closure. Based on the work of [61], Nguyen [60] viewed a force-closure grasp as the vector-closure of its contact wrenches.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, every closed and smooth curve has at least a pair of antipodal points 9 that admit a force-closure grasp. (See <ref> [10, 6] </ref> for proofs.) So we will be mainly interested in how to attain two-finger force-closure grasps, though not necessarily at pairs of antipodal points.

Reference-contexts: The quality of a grasp can also be measured as the magnitude of the minimum, over all directions, of the maximum wrench resistible by the fingers exerting forces of unit total magnitude or of unit maximum magnitude. Optimal grasp algorithms are given by Ferrari and Canny <ref> [25] </ref> for two-jaw and three-jaw grippers grasping polygons, in which case only finite number of good grasps need to be considered. By decoupling force and torque, Mirtich and Canny [55] are able to develop an easily computable optimality measure.

Reference-contexts: Sliding operations were also first identified as fundamental to manipulation, and especially to grasping, in [51]. A geometric tool very useful in the analysis of pushing tasks is the limit surface model of friction introduced to planar sliding by Goyal et al. <ref> [27] </ref>. The limit surface of a sliding object bounds the set of frictional forces and torques on the object in all possible motions (including no motion). In quasi-static pushing, the frictional wrench stays on the limit surface where the normal gives the corresponding velocity direction. <p> In my proposal, both sliding friction and contact friction will be taken into account. Dynamics of sliding rigid bodies is treated in MacMillan [46] on linear pressure distribu tions over the planar base of contact. Goyal et al. <ref> [27] </ref> use the limit surface description of friction to show that a freely sliding object always comes to rest with one of several definite ratios of translation to rotation.

Reference-contexts: Contact positions in our method are analogous to "features" extracted from object images in object recognition. Gremban and Ikeuchi <ref> [28] </ref> consider planning sensor motion to obtain multiple observations and combine them with the known three-dimensional structure of the object to resolve recognition ambiguities. 3.8.2 Tactile Sensing Fingertip force sensing was proposed by Salisbury [73] who gave procedures for locating position and orientation of contacts from minimal measured force/torque information.

Reference-contexts: These results show that quasi-static sliding analyses can be used for motion planning with soft sliding fingertips, provided that the average speed is low and the average coefficient of friction and normal force are accurately known. Trinkle and Paul <ref> [77] </ref> exploit the problem of achieving a force-closure grasp of a two dimensional object by frictionless sliding at the contacts between the object and an articu lated hand.

Reference-contexts: Tighter bounds were later obtained by Markenscoff et al. [48] for force closure grasps on any two- and three-dimensional object, for frictional as well as frictionless contacts. 23 Trinkle <ref> [78] </ref> formulates the test of form closure as a linear program whose optimal ob jective value measures how far a grasp is from losing the closure.

Reference-contexts: Other sensing work relying on geometric constraints include [26] by Gaston and Lozano Perez who identify and locate a polyhedron on the plane using contact locations and normals obtained by tactile sensors, and <ref> [80] </ref> by Wallack et al. who show how to compute the orien tation of a polygon from its diameters measured along three different directions. Contact positions in our method are analogous to "features" extracted from object images in object recognition.

Reference-contexts: The kinematics and dynamics of the manipulation of a planar object sliding on a multifingered jig is treated by Yashima et al. <ref> [81] </ref>. Omata and Nagata [62] give a search algorithm to plan for a sequence of finger repo sitionings that reorient a grasped object.
