Abstract: We provide a map fi 7! fi which associates each finite set fi of points in C s with a polynomial space fi from which interpolation to arbitrary data given at the points in fi is possible and uniquely so. Among all polynomial spaces Q from which interpolation at fi is uniquely possible, our fi is of smallest degree. It is also D- and scale-invariant. Our map is monotone, thus providing a Newton form for the resulting interpolant. Our map is also continuous within reason, allowing us to interpret certain cases of coalescence as Hermite interpolation. In fact, our map can be extended to the case where, with each 2 fi, there is associated a polynomial space P , and, for given smooth f , a polynomial q 2 Q is sought for which We obtain fi as the "scaled limit at the origin" (Exp fi ) # of the exponential space Exp fi with frequencies fi, and base our results on a study of the map H 7! H # defined on subspaces H of the space of functions analytic at the origin. This study also allows us to determine the local approximation order from such H and provides an algorithm for the construction of H # from any basis for H. p(D)(f q)() = 0; all p 2 P ; 2 fi:

Reference-contexts: For these reasons, generalizations have stressed some aspects of polynomial interpolation and ignored others. For example, there are various efforts (see, e.g., <ref> [CY] </ref>, [GM]) to identify finite sets fi for which it is easy to construct polynomial Lagrange functions, i.e., polynomials p with p (t ) = ffi ;t .

Reference-contexts: The remainder of the paper is devoted to the specific choice H = P 2fi e P of exponentials. The fact that its least part H # supplies correct conditions for interpolation from H is used in Section 7 to conclude by duality, as in <ref> [DR] </ref>, that it is possible to interpolate, and uniquely so, from the polynomial space H # using the interpolation conditions []p (D); p 2 P ; 2 fi.

Reference-contexts: Except for special circumstances, it is usually hard to ascertain the degree of the resulting interpolant or the maximal k for which k lies in the range of this interpolant. A totally different effort, associated with the name Kergin (see <ref> [K] </ref>, [M]), retains the fact that, with an arbitrary set fi of cardinality k + 1, we interpolate from k . The additional degrees of freedom available in a multivariate context Kergin disposes of in such a way that `natural' meanvalue theorems continue to hold.

Reference-contexts: Then H # is a polynomial space of least degree among all polynomial spaces from which interpolation with interpolation conditions fl (fi; (P )) := spanf []p (D) : p 2 P ; 2 fig is correct. In univariate Hermite-Birkhoff interpolation <ref> [LJR] </ref>, one matches certain derivatives rather than linear combinations of derivatives. Correspondingly, we will use the term Hermite-Birkhoff interpolation in the multivariate context of (7.3)Theorem in case all the spaces P have a homo geneous basis, i.e., are scale-invariant.
