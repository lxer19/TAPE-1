Title: Giving Permission Implies Giving Choice  
Abstract: This article presents the formalisation of the weak and strong permission in deontic logic based on the logic of enactment. A permission that follows from the absence of a prohibition, we call a weak permission; this permission is not enacted. A strong permission is always enacted (implicitly or explicitly), and implies a giving choice. The distinction between these two types of permission is a consequent of the universality of a normative system by the closure rule: `whatever is not forbidden, is permitted'. Further we present a modification of the logic of enactment with local reasoning. The basic idea behind this treatment is that authorities may enact conflicting normative rules, depending on the frame of reference. The main strength of the presented theory is that we are now able to reason consistently in the presence of inconsistent enacted norms.

Reference-contexts: At first glance, this axiom does not seem to be controversial, since it merely denies the existence of impossible obligations. However, with the help of this axiom we can derive the formula :(O (p) ^ O (:p)), which is controversial nowadays (see, eg. <ref> [1] </ref>; [18]; [21]). The main objection to this formula is that it states that there is no conflict of duties, which is clearly not in line with situations in daily life.

Reference-contexts: We show how we can reason consistently with enacted norms without requiring all enacted norms to be normative consistent. The `classical' notion of normative inconsistency is that two authorities promulgated (enacted) two contradictory or conflicting norms, which is a frequent phenomenon, at least in certain areas like law (see <ref> [3] </ref>). The conflict arises when the norms become members of the same normative system, not if they belong to different systems.

Reference-contexts: So, the law is not merely a set of norms, but a hierarchical system. When we consider the norms in a legal system, we can often discern some kind of hierarchy among the norms: some are regarded as more basic than others (cf. <ref> [4] </ref>). The consequence of the fact that an enacted permission is always an exception of a prohibition or obligation is that the addressees (to whom the permission is directed) always have a choice to perform the permitted act or not.

Reference-contexts: In jurisprudence this principle is usually labelled as `sealing legal principle', often formulated as `whatever is not forbid den, is permitted' (cf. [28]; see also <ref> [5] </ref>). This regulation `does not function here through logical necessity, but because of legislation, in this way making absence of norms within these systems impossible' ([27]). We call these systems closed legal systems, also called universal normative systems.

Reference-contexts: In most legal support/expert systems only the appli cable norms are considered. It is impossible in these systems to talk about the rules that select applicable norms explicitly. This is the main disadvantage of using non-monotonic logic (see [23] and <ref> [6] </ref>), logics with minimal models (see [8]) and argumentation approaches (cf. [10]; [11]; [22]). In these theories we can reason with inconsistent information, but the level is always of applicable norms. One cannot reason about enacted norms which are not applicable.

Reference-contexts: A norm is often also said to be valid in the sense that it is obligatory or has a `binding force': applicability. Both of them play a central role in law and in legal theories (cf. <ref> [7] </ref>). In most legal support/expert systems only the appli cable norms are considered. It is impossible in these systems to talk about the rules that select applicable norms explicitly.

This is the main disadvantage of using non-monotonic logic (see [23] and [6]), logics with minimal models (see <ref> [8] </ref>) and argumentation approaches (cf. [10]; [11]; [22]). In these theories we can reason with inconsistent information, but the level is always of applicable norms. One cannot reason about enacted norms which are not applicable. <p> In this article we use the standard deontic logic, a modal (Kripke-style) version of the now so-called `Old System' of Von Wright ([30]). We mean the system D fl (the smallest normal KD-system of modal logic (cf. <ref> [8] </ref>)), based on propositional logic and axiomatised by the following axiom schemata: (OC) (O (p) ^ O (q)) ! O (p ^ q) together with the rule of inference: (ROM ) p!q Axiom (ON) was rejected by Von Wright ([30]), since he developed the principle of deontic contingency: `A tautologous act <p> Furthermore, belief and enactment correspond in the sense that a belief is not necessarily true, just as an enacted norm is not necessarily applicable. In this section, we briefly review possible-worlds semantics for enactment, corresponding with the semantics for belief and knowledge (cf. <ref> [8] </ref>; [13]). The in tuitive idea behind the possible-worlds model is that, besides the true state of affairs, there are a number of other possible states of affairs, or possible worlds. <p> The fact that B A i is serial means that in all worlds, the enacted norms can be applied some way; from this it follows that falsehood cannot be enacted. We do not have the assumptions that B A i is transitive and Euclidean, as in KD45 (cf. <ref> [8] </ref>), since we are not dealing with nested enactments. Intuitively, (w; w 0 ) 2 B A i if in a world w, the set A i of authorities considers world w 0 possible, i.e., A i considers his enacted norms in w applicable in w 0 as possible. <p> Thus, the statement ` is enacted' describes some idealised world and not the actual world. &gt;From the semantics it follows that the rules and the first three axioms are valid (cf. <ref> [8] </ref>). <p> The notion of implicit enactment still suffers from the problem that then everything is (implicitly) enacted. Only if the set of explicitly enacted norms is consistent, then the notion of implicit enactment has its value. Note that explicit enactment inplies implicit enactment. In <ref> [8] </ref>, Chellas argues that an adequate logic of norms should be able to express conflicts of norms, but he also wants to be able to retain the deontic counterparts of (A3). However, one cannot keep (A3) and allow consistent expression of normative conflict (i.e.

Reference-contexts: A survey of applications can be found in [20]. Deontic logic forms the basis of several legal expert systems (e.g. <ref> [9] </ref>). Therefore, we start with a brief explanation of deontic logic. In deontic logic, three deontic operators are used: `O' (obligatory), `F ' (forbidden) and `P ' (permitted).

Reference-contexts: We treat enactment as a variant of the belief theory. However, in this theory we cannot adequately express normative inconsistencies. Therefore, we propose an extension of these theories, based on the theory of `local reasoning' (see <ref> [12] </ref>). The basic idea behind this treatment is that authorities may enact several (inconsistent) norms, depending on the frame of reference. The applicability of norms depends on the situation, on the relative importance of the norms, etc. <p> As we already mentioned, it is a frequent phenomenon that normative authorities enact conflicting norms. This is a very serious problem, which we discuss in the next two sections (see also <ref> [12] </ref> and [25]). For the moment, we assume that the set of enacted norms is normatively consistent, i.e., there are no conflicting norms. From this fact, we can create an actual world that corresponds with the ideal world: all the enacted norms are applicable. <p> However, in these systems we cannot specify explicitly the minimal models. Thus, in order to try to solve this problem of inconsistent enacted norms, we have to do something different, and deviate from the standard modal approach even further, by making of the logic of local reasoning presented by <ref> [12] </ref>. 7. Local reasoning In the logic of local reasoning, there is not necessar-ily one set of worlds that a set of authorities thinks possible, but rather a number of sets, each one corresponding to a different cluster of enacted norms.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, belief and enactment correspond in the sense that a belief is not necessarily true, just as an enacted norm is not necessarily applicable. In this section, we briefly review possible-worlds semantics for enactment, corresponding with the semantics for belief and knowledge (cf. [8]; <ref> [13] </ref>). The in tuitive idea behind the possible-worlds model is that, besides the true state of affairs, there are a number of other possible states of affairs, or possible worlds.

Reference-contexts: Another and perhaps also naive attempt is to solve the problem by distinguishing implicit and explicit enactment. (The notion of explicit and implicit enactment does not correspond to the notions of explicit and implicit belief by <ref> [16] </ref>.) We have to use an extra modal operator N e A i , standing for explicit enactment. We define the implicit enacted norms by A i as the norms that are the logical consequences of the explicit enacted norms by A i .

Reference-contexts: Such a system loses its meaning in a logical sense in the case of inconsistency: everything can be deduced and, in particular, all obligations, permissions, etc., are deducible (ex falso sequitur quodlibet). There are two specific types of normative conflicts (cf. <ref> [17] </ref>): * disaffirmation conflicts: these conflicts describe the same behaviour, but the deontic modalities contradict. For example, it is forbidden to turn left and it is not forbidden (permitted) to turn left. * compliance conflicts: these conflicts occur when the actions which are obliged by different norms are incompatible. <p> A consequence is that the formula O (p) ^ F (p) can be consistent, however these norms (O (p) and F (p)) are obviously conflicting: they are normatively inconsistent. According to <ref> [17] </ref>, these conflicts are compliance conflicts. 3. The strong and weak permission In the Dutch Traffic Regulation part of the Dutch criminal law a regulation concerning a permission is always an exception of an obligation or a prohibition ([15]).

Reference-contexts: The driver breaks the law in this situation, and he cannot maintain that it was permitted to drive at a speed of 100 km/h on this section of the road (cf. <ref> [24] </ref>). As it has been said, a permission is weak (in the sense here relevant) if the act (proposition) is not forbidden. The permission is strong if the act is not forbidden, though subject to norm (cf. [27]).

Reference-contexts: The normative conflicts are caused, for instance, by the dynamics of the legal system (by the enactment of new norms), by the uncertainty concerning the content of the legal sources (regulations can be vague or ambiguous), etc. (cf. <ref> [26] </ref>). One way to deal with these type of conflicts is to add sets of authorities enacting the norms to standard deon-tic logic. Here we use the term authority in an abstract way. <p> Expert systems should contain rules indicating which of the enacted norms are applicable. These rules can be obtained by factors of the powers and competencies of the normative authorities (issuing bodies), dates of promulgation and amendment, the degree of specificity or generality of the regulations, etc. (See <ref> [26] </ref>.) Further, we have shown how we can determine the applicability of norms in a particular situation by local reasoning. The idea is that in spite of the normative conflicts, lawyers make use of a consistent set of rules.

Reference-contexts: As it has been said, a permission is weak (in the sense here relevant) if the act (proposition) is not forbidden. The permission is strong if the act is not forbidden, though subject to norm (cf. <ref> [27] </ref>). This means that a permission is strong if and only if it is enacted by a normative authority (explicitly enacted permission) or if the permission is a logical consequence from a norm or set of norms enacted by a normative authority (implicitly enacted permission).

Reference-contexts: The idea is that a later enacted prohibition could be in conflict with a strong permission, but not with a weak permission. If an act is weak permitted then the prohibition of that act can be given with any conflict (cf. <ref> [29] </ref>). In standard de-ontic logic, we cannot distinguish the strong and weak permission, since there is no explicit indication to the enactment of norms (they are God given). In the next section we will formalise these two types of permission with the help of the logic of enactment (cf. [25]).

([27]) So, we can distinguish two types of permission: * the permission which is an exception of an obliga- tion or a prohibition: the strong permission; * the permission which follows from the absence of a prohibition: the weak permission (cf. <ref> [31] </ref>). A consequence of the strong permission is that also the negation of the permitted act is permitted, since the strong permission is an exception to a general article (rule), and one does not break the law by following nevertheless that general article.
