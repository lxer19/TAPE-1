Abstract: We describe a system that provides query based associative access to the contents of distributed information servers. In typical distributed information systems there are so many objects that underconstrained queries can produce large result sets and extraordinary processing costs. To deal with this scaling problem we use content labels to permit users to learn about available resources and to formulate queries with adequate discriminatory power. We have implemented associative access to a distributed set of information servers in the content routing system. A content routing system is a hierarchy of servers called content routers that present a single query based image of a distributed information system. We have successfully used a prototype content routing system to locate documents on several user file systems and on a large number of information servers.

Reference-contexts: Network navigation systems such as the Gopher system <ref> [1] </ref> and the World-Wide Web [3] provide a means for organizing servers to allow navigating among and browsing through remote information. Gopher provides the equivalent of a distributed file service, and World-Wide Web provides distributed hypertext documents.

Reference-contexts: Simpson and Alonso propose a querying architecture for a network of autonomous databases [18] that forwards user queries to known information sources. This approach has a probabilistic query semantics and does not support browsing with query refinement. The Information Brokers of the MITL Gold project <ref> [2] </ref> do not provide access to objects directly. Rather, they return descriptions of an object's location and the method that may be used to retrieve the object. The concepts of query routing and query refinement were introduced in [9].

Discovering and locating information in these systems is difficult because these systems do not support query routing.

Reference-contexts: No previous system combines a coherent architecture for associative access to distributed, heterogeneous information servers with query-specific feedback to help the user organize the search space. Distributed naming systems such as X.500 <ref> [4] </ref>, Profile [16], the Networked Resource Discovery Project [17], and Nomenclator [14] provide attribute-based access to a wide variety of objects; however, they do not support the hierarchical relationship between servers and data that our system achieves through its use of content labels.

Reference-contexts: The Conit system [12, 13] provides a uniform user interface to a large number of databases accessible from several retrieval systems. There is no support for the automatic selection of relevant databases for a query. The Distributed Indexing mechanism <ref> [5] </ref> is based on precomputed indices of databases that summarize the holdings on particular topics of other databases. The architecture has a fixed three layer structure that is not flexible enough for content based access to heterogeneous information servers.

Reference-contexts: As only part of catalog files (headlines) is used for constructing content labels and only unique terms are kept, the size of the resulting content labels is 12.4MB. To provide access to WAIS servers, we implemented an SFS-WAIS gateway so that WAIS servers are viewed as SFS servers <ref> [6] </ref>. The SFS-WAIS gateway translates SFS queries into WAIS questions and uses the public domain client WAIS code for querying WAIS servers. 6 Experience We have used several configurations of our content routing system. We measured the performance of query routing in a small system of four semantic file systems.

Reference-contexts: Network-based information retrieval systems provide access to information on remote servers. The Wide Area Information Service (WAIS) [11, 19] provides a uniform means of access to information servers on a network. However, the user must choose appropriate servers from a directory of services. The Archie system <ref> [7] </ref> polls FTP sites on the Internet and indexes the files by name. A query yields a set of host/filename pairs which may be used to retrieve the relevant files manually.

Reference-contexts: The system uses the Semantic File System interface <ref> [8] </ref> for both information servers and content routers. Because it is implemented as an SFS server, our content router is a user level NFS server that may be mounted by any NFS client. Figure 4 shows the architecture of our prototype content router implementation.
