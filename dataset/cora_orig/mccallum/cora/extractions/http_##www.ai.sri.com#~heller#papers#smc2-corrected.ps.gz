Abstract: The central component in the RADIUS model-supported image exploitation paradigm, is the creation of a 3-dimensional model that captures the basic geometry of the site under examination. While many fully automated methods for site model construction show promising results, none are robust or general enough to replace interactive and semiautomatic techniques. In this paper, we outline the suite of site-model construction tools being assembled for the RADIUS program, a sample scenario for their use, and the results of a study to characterize the potential saving of effort they offer.

Reference-contexts: After positioning the initial vertex, the Add Vertex operation is used to interactively sketch the shape of 2 the feature. At this point the semi-automatic Model--Based Optimization (MBO) system <ref> [ Fua, 1995 ] </ref> can be invoked to refine the fit of the model to the shape of feature in the image. Figure 2, shows the model of a pond before and after optimization. <p> They are: HAND Hand-tracing using the RTS interface but neither snakes nor road tracker.

SNAKE2 Sketching the road using a half-resolution version of the image, refining it using a ribbon snake first at half-resolution and then at full resolution.

Reference-contexts: This is a 3D curve that has an additional parameter at each vertex to specify the width of the curve at that point. Two tools are currently available in the RTS to model LOCs: the SRI Road Tracker [ Quam, 1978 ] and Ziplock Snakes <ref> [ Neuenschwander et al., 1994 ] </ref> . To use the Road Tracker, first an initial segment of the road is modeled. Then the extend function is invoked to model the remainder. <p> This number could be drastically reduced by defining user-interface methods that sequentially perform all these operations with a single mouse-click. The SNAKE2 approach is almost as effective but requires more effort to provide the initial sketch. This problem could alleviated by using ziplock snakes <ref> [ Neuenschwander et al., 1994 ] </ref> instead of traditional snakes. For all three semiautomated methods, however, a large portion of the human interaction goes into specifying the width of the road as the current tools have no way of computing it.

Reference-contexts: Roads are modeled using the ribbon primitive. This is a 3D curve that has an additional parameter at each vertex to specify the width of the curve at that point. Two tools are currently available in the RTS to model LOCs: the SRI Road Tracker <ref> [ Quam, 1978 ] </ref> and Ziplock Snakes [ Neuenschwander et al., 1994 ] . To use the Road Tracker, first an initial segment of the road is modeled. Then the extend function is invoked to model the remainder. <p> We chose four approaches that are representative of the methods used to delineate roads using the RTS. They are: HAND Hand-tracing using the RTS interface but neither snakes nor road tracker.
