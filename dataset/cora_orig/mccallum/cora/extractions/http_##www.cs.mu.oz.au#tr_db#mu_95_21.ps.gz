Title: Relativistic ray-tracing: simulating the visual appearance of rapidly moving objects  
Author: Andrew Howard Sandy Dance Les Kitchen 
Date: 24 July 1995  
Abstract: Many of the effects that arise when objects are moving close to the speed of light are counter-intuitive. Not least of these is the effect of large velocities on the visual appearance of moving objects. While this effect has been discussed mathematically, sophisticated computer simulations have not previously been available. In this report we show how the visual appearance of rapidly moving objects can be simulated by incorporating a relativistic correction into a standard ray-tracing algorithm. The images generated by this algorithm show interesting effects that require subtle interpretation.

Reference-contexts: the result (which is, of course, equivalent to the moving camera case) is much more difficult to implement in a standard ray-tracer. 4 Experiments 4.1 Implementation with POV-Ray The sample images in this report were generated using a modified version of the freeware Persistence of Vision Ray Tracer (version 2.0) <ref> [5] </ref>. POV-Ray is particular well suited to this problem as it is available in source form and is capable of rendering superb images using a flexible scene description language.
