Title: J'n'J in Jape  
Author: Bernard Sufrin Richard Bornat 
Date: December 2, 1996  
Abstract: In this note we show how Jape's presentations of proofs are related to the natural-deduction presentations used by Jim Woodcock and Jim Davies in [7] ("the book"). This is followed by description of Jape implementation - J'n'J- of the logic described in the book. The implementation is designed to present a fairly natural direct-manipulation interface to its users, and we also explain the details of its realisation in the Jape tactic language. The note is designed as background reading for anyone wishing to know how to implement a logic with Jape, or to conduct proofs in J'n'J. It is best read in conjunction with the early chapters of the book, but anyone who is used to the natural-deduction style of proof presentation will be on familiar territory. In a companion paper [6] we present several case-studies in the use of the Unix/X implementation of Jape to do proofs with J'n'J.
