Abstract: We present simplified proofs for a variety of switching lemmas. Our arguments ex tend recent switching lemma improvements to show, using simple counting techniques, that under restriction, DNF (resp. CNF) formulas can be represented by small height decision trees. We also show how the lemmas are applied in different contexts. In addition to reproving existing results, we also present a proof of a new switching lemma for restrictions that are partial q-matchings.

Reference-contexts: To this end, one chooses a family of restrictions that is tailored to the function being computed and argues that some member of the family has the desired properties. Although switching lemmas were found originally by Furst, Saxe, and Sipser [FSS81] (and independently in a different guise by Ajtai <ref> [Ajt83] </ref>,) the model for the most powerful of these switching lemmas is that of H-astad [H-as87]. The argument uses the probabilistic method one argues that the probability that a restriction from the family fails to have the desired properties is strictly less than 1.

Reference-contexts: They were appropriate for proving lower bounds on the parity function. In this section we consider restrictions that are tailored for proving lower bounds on the clique function for small values of the clique size. The switching lemma for these restrictions that we re-derive was originally proved by Beame <ref> [Bea90] </ref>. The technique here is more general than that of the previous section and was suggested to us by Johan H-astad although the general outline is the same. <p> In any case, we can now derive the resulting lower bound. Theorem 9: (Beame <ref> [Bea90] </ref>) Any unbounded fan-in circuit of depth d computing the Clique k n function for 4 k log 2 n requires size S &gt; n k Proof: Suppose that C computes the Clique k n function in size S and depth d. <p> The rest of the argument goes through exactly as before. 2 7 Lower Bounds for CRCW PRAMs The lower bounds proofs for CRCW PRAMs in <ref> [BH89, Bea90] </ref> can also be simplified in a similar manner to that described above for unbounded fan-in circuits.

Reference-contexts: This is a slightly stronger statement than the standard switching lemma phrasing since a small height decision tree allows one to obtain a short DNF formula for the negation of the formula which is essentially what is desired. This formulation of a switching lemma was first used by Cai <ref> [Cai86] </ref>. Several authors have subsequently noted that H-astad's argument also works in this fashion.
