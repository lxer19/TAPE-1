Abstract: The paper addresses how relevance feedback can be used to improve the performance of content-based image retrieval. We present two supervised learning methods: learning the query and learning the metric. We combine the learning methods with the recently proposed color correlograms for image indexing/retrieval. Our results on a large image database of over 20; 000 images suggest that these learning methods are quite effective for content-based image retrieval.

The problem of content-based image retrieval has been widely studied [3, 8, 11, 1, 10]. The color correlogram was recently proposed as an image feature vector for image indexing and retrieval in <ref> [5] </ref>. It was shown to be robust in tolerating large changes in the appearance of a scene caused by changes in viewing positions, changes in the background scene, partial occlusions, camera zoom that causes radical changes in shape, etc. <p> This problem is especially acute for very large image databases. Moreover, the histogram is not robust to large appearance changes. Several recently proposed schemes incorporate spatial information about colors to improve upon the histogram method <ref> [14, 13, 15, 9, 10, 5] </ref>. One approach [14, 15] divides images into subregions and imposes positional constraints on the image comparison (image partitioning). Another approach [9, 10] augments histograms with local spatial properties (histogram refinement). The color correlogram [5], makes use of spatial correlation between pairs of colors. <p> One approach [14, 15] divides images into subregions and imposes positional constraints on the image comparison (image partitioning).

The following briefly describes some of these methods. Smith and Chang [14] partition an image into binary color sets. They first select all colors that are sufficiently present in a region. <p> Since local correlations between colors are more significant than global correlations in an image, a small value of d is sufficient to capture the spatial correlation. An efficient algorithm for computing correlograms can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. Correlograms, like histograms, can be viewed as feature vectors of images. We use fl (I) (resp. ff (I)) to denote the correlogram (resp. autocorrelogram) of I, treated as vectors in m 2 d (resp, md) dimensional space. <p> gradient direction, is likely to be sensitive to large appearance changes, correlograms are more stable to these changes; while any scheme that is based on purely global properties, such as histograms, is susceptible to false positive matches, correlograms are largely successful in minimizing false matches by effectively using spatial information <ref> [5] </ref>. Moreover, without significant loss of performance, the space requirements for correlograms can also be made exactly the same as for histograms [6] (banded cor- relograms). Correlograms thus prove to be both efficient and effective for content-based image retrieval from a large image database.

We also conduct some preliminary experiments exploring the usefulness of learning techniques for the object-searching problem. An interesting object in an image is selected as the query and images are retrieved using the Correlogram Intersection method <ref> [6] </ref>. The user then examines the top-ranked images (typically ten or less), and marks a few (typically three to five) of the useful images.

They first select all colors that are sufficiently present in a region. The colors for a region are represented by a binary color set that is computed using histogram back-projection <ref> [16] </ref>. The binary color sets and their location information constitute the feature for an image. This feature can be used to process region queries that our method cannot handle, for example, a query where the sun is setting in the upper left part of the image. <p> Correlograms were also used to address the object searching problem [6]. The notion of intersection of a model with an image was extended to correlograms and the resulting method was shown to perform better than methods that use the traditional histogram intersection scheme <ref> [16] </ref>. SOME LEARNING METHODS In this section, we look at the issue of using relevance feedback from the user to improve the performance of the cor- relogram. In a real-life scenario, the user can provide this information with very little effort.

Reference-contexts: The autocorrelogram of I 1 The term correlogram is adapted from spatial data analysis: correl- ograms are graphs (or tables) that show how spatial autocorrelation changes with distance. <ref> [17] </ref> captures the spatial correlation between identical colors only and is defined by ff (k) c;c (I): (5) This information is a subset of the correlogram and requires only md space.
