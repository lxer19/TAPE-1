Abstract: A set of monomials x a 0 ; : : : ; x a r is called interpolating with respect to a subset S of the finite field F q , if it has the property that given any pairwise different elements x 0 ; : : : ; x r in S and any set of elements y 0 ; : : : ; y r in F q there are elements c 0 ; : : : ; c r in F q such that y h = P r a j h for 0 h r. In this paper we address the question of determining interpolating sets with respect to S = F q and S = F fi q . For q a prime and S = F q this is a problem of N. Reingold and D. Spielman posed by A. Odlyzko in [10, p. 399]. We call the interpolating set fx a 0 ; : : : ; x a r g trivial if its exponent set coincides with f0; b; 2b; : : : ; rbg mod (q 1) for some b coprime to q 1. The question is whether all interpolating sets with respect to F q are trivial. We start by relating this to a problem on cyclic MDS codes. We then show that for r = 2 and S = F fi q the problem is equivalent to whether or not for some m the polynomial (x m 1)=(x 1) is a permutation polynomial over F q . The latter problem has been investigated by R. Matthews [9]. Using Bezout's Theorem and results on arcs in projective spaces, we show that in a certain range for r (depending on q and the maximum of the a i ) the only interpolating sets with respect to F fi q are trivial. We then proceed to sharpen this result for the special exponent set 0; 1; 2; : : : ; r 1; m where m satisfies r m q 2. Finally, we exhibit an example of a nontrivial interpolating set with respect to F fi q for even q 8. In the language of finite geometries this is an example of a complete q-arc over F q , and in the language of coding theory this is an example of a cyclic MDS-code which is not equivalent to a generalized Reed-Solomon code.

Reference-contexts: We show that these sets are interpolating if the polynomial x b1 + + x + 1 is a permutation polynomial over F q , where b is an integer obtained from the exponent set in question. This problem has been investigated by Matthews <ref> [9] </ref>. Using his results, we show that for odd q interpolating exponent sets of size three are trivial. <p> Hence, we deduce by Wan's Theorem [15] that x b1 + : : : + 1 is a permutation polynomial. A result of Matthews' <ref> [9] </ref> yields that b = 2 if q is odd. Proposition 3. For odd q exponent sets of size three with respect to F q (F fi q ) are trivial (essentially trivial). <p> In general, interpolating exponent sets of size three over finite fields of characteristic two correspond to certain ovals in finite Desarguesian planes of even order, for which a complete description has not yet appeared.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, for these sets the above determinant is essentially Vandermonde. In the sequel we call these sets "trivial." A problem of Nick Reingold and Dan Spielman posed by Andrew Odlyzko in <ref> [10, p. 399] </ref> asks whether for q a prime all interpolating sets with respect to F q are trivial.

Reference-contexts: Much of the research on arcs has concentrated on the following three problems posed by B.

(2) For what values of r and q, with q &gt; r + 1, is every (q + 1)-arc of P r (F q )

We remark that the the bound in Part (1) of the above theorem can be improved considerably of q is a prime, see <ref> [12] </ref>. Using the above results and the Bezout Inequality we will be able to prove that certain interpolating exponent sets are essentially trivial.
