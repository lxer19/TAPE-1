Abstract: This paper introduces the Spline Animator module, which facilitates the use of smooth camera motion in AVS animations. In particular, the module features a highly intuitive interface which allows the user to define a set of keyframes determining the resulting camera path. The module then generates smooth camera motion by interpolating these keyframes with uniform cubic splines. The functionality of the module is explained in detail and an example camera path is presented.

Reference-contexts: Theory The construction of splines through a particular set of data is fundamental to the functionality of the module. Thus we first embark on a discussion of the technique of splining with uniform cubic splines. The following exposition can be found in more detail in Bartels <ref> [1] </ref>. 1 Consider a set of n + 1 data points fx i ; i = 0; :::; ng through which we wish to draw a curve X (u) as shown in Figure 1. Let X i (u) denote the curve segment between points x i and x i+1 .
