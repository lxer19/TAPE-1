Abstract: It is demonstrated that a given value of average genus is shared by at most finitely many 2-connected simplicial graphs and by at most finitely many 3-connected graphs. Moreover, the distribution of values of average genus is sparse, in the following sense: within any finite real interval, there are at most finitely many different numbers that are values of average genus for 2-connected simplicial graphs or for 3-connected graphs. Thus, there are no limit points for the values of average genus of graphs in these classes. The potential applicability of these results to graph iso morphism testing is considered.

Reference-contexts: We are able to prove that the necklace construction is essentially the only way to manufacture arbitrary large 2-connected graphs with average genus below a fixed bound and to make limit points for values of average genus of 2-connected graphs. See Chen and Gross <ref> [ChGr 1991b] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Then the maximum genus of G is at least k + 1. Proof. We prove the lemma by induction on the exponent k. In Chen and Gross <ref> [ChGr 1991c] </ref>, it was proved that with only five exceptions, all 2-connected graphs of maximum genus less than or equal to 1 can be characterized as "necklaces", which are all nonsimplicial graphs. Moreover, all those five exceptional graphs have fewer than 9 edges.

Reference-contexts: This completes the proof. Remark Lemma 3.2 might seem intuitively obvious at first glance. After all, the maximum genus of an increasing sequence of graphs "ought" to increase. However, additional conditions such as 2-connectedness and sim-plicialness are necessary. (See Gross, Klein, and Rieper [GrKlRi 1989].)

Reference-contexts: We have a relationship between H n and ln n: ln n &lt; H n &lt; ln n + 1 Proof. The proofs for all these equalities except (16) can be found in <ref> [GrKnPa 1989] </ref>. The equality (16) follows directly from equality (9) and equality (10). Lemma 5.3 n X k s (n; k) = H n n! (17) k=0 Proof. From equality (14) in Lemma 5.2, let m = 1, then apply the equality (13) to obtain the equality (17).
