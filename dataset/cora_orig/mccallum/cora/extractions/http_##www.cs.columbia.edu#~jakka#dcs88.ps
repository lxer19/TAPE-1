Reference-contexts: We feel that one of the major contributions of our micro-economic approach is a unified framework for allocating all resources in a computer system. Through a competitive pricing mechanism, a tradeoff between communication and computational resources and their demands is automatically obtained. Bryant and Finkel <ref> [1] </ref> have identified stability as an important aspect of any load sharing algorithm. An algorithm is said to be unstable if it can enter a state in which all jobs are constantly migrating in an attempt to balance loads. In an unstable state, no productive processing is being done. <p> This situation is similar to thrashing in a demand paging, virtual memory system [2]. In previous work, stability is either ignored [19, 21] or is enforced by augmenting the load sharing algorithm with heuristics to ensure that unstable states do not occur <ref> [1, 4, 7] </ref>. Using a microeconomic approach, the same pricing mechanism that controls resource allocation and defines relative values of resources also enforces stability. Since jobs are charged for the use of communication resources, it is impossible for a job to migrate indefinitely.
