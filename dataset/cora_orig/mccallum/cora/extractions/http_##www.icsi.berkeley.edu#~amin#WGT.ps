Abstract: We discuss the problem of determining the weight distribution of linear codes on elliptic curves. It is shown that the weight enumerators of non-MDS elliptic codes are completely determined by the number of minimum weight codewords. Using the structure of the group of rational points of the curves in question, we give a procedure to determine the number of minimum weight codewords. For two classes of elliptic codes we shall give explicit formulas for this number. Several examples are presented.

Reference-contexts: A C (z) of C is defined by A C (z) := P n The importance of the weight enumerator of a linear code is partly due to the fact that the weight enumerator of a (linear) code C is directly related to the probability of decoding failure of C <ref> [1, Chapter 16] </ref>. The problem of determining the weight enumerator of an arbitrary linear code which is e.g. given by its generator matrix seems to be very hard.

Reference-contexts: be easily derived from its weight 1 enumerator, the determination of the latter is at least as hard as the deter-mination of the minimum distance which is conjectured to be NP-complete in the case of linear codes. (To be more accurate, the corresponding decision problem is conjectured to be NP-complete <ref> [2, 11] </ref>). Surprisingly there are classes of linear codes, for which the weight enumerators are known.

Reference-contexts: By elliptic codes we mean linear codes constructed on elliptic curves over finite fields using Goppa's construction of algebraico-geometric codes <ref> [3, 7] </ref>. It turns out that elliptic codes are almost MDS: If the elliptic code C is an (n; k; d)-code, then either d = n k or d = n k + 1. In the latter case C is of course MDS.

Reference-contexts: Surprisingly there are classes of linear codes, for which the weight enumerators are known. For the class of MDS-codes there exist explicit formulae for the coefficients of the weight enumerators <ref> [5, Chapter 11] </ref>. (Recall that an (n; k; d)-code C is called MDS, if d = n k + 1.) In this paper we are going to investigate the problem of computing the weight enumerator of elliptic codes. <p> Once the dual distance of C is known, one can use the MacWilliams-identities in order to give explicit formulae for the coefficients of the weight enumerator of C. The method involved is similar to the method for computing the weight enumerator of an MDS-code as is done in <ref> [5, Chapter 11] </ref>. It turns out that the weight enumerator of an elliptic (n; k; n k)-code is completely determined by the number of minimum weight codewords, that is codewords of weight n k. <p> The determination of the minimum distance d of C (G; D) turns out to be more difficult. Using the Theorem of Riemann-Roch, one gets the inequality d n k. In view of the Singleton-inequality d n k + 1 <ref> [5, Chapter 2] </ref>, d can only take the values n k or n k + 1. In the latter case, C (G; D) is MDS. <p> Then, as was pointed out in the last section, we have d 2 fn k; n k + 1g. If d = n k + 1 then C is MDS. This case is not of interest to us, since the weight distribution of MDS-codes is well-known <ref> [5, Chapter 11] </ref>. So assume that d = n k. Let C ? denote the dual of C. <p> Theorem 2.5] C ? is an (n; n k; d 0 )-code with d 0 2 fk; k + 1g. (Actually, the mentioned theorem implies that C ? is an elliptic code, so the assertion on d 0 follows.) Since C is assumed to be non-MDS, so is C ? <ref> [5, Chapter 11] </ref>; thus d 0 = k. Lemma 1 The dual distance of the (n; k; n k)-elliptic-code C equals k. fl Let A w and B w denote the number of codewords of weight w of C resp. C ? . The MacWilliams identities [5, Chapter 11] relate these <p> so is C ? <ref> [5, Chapter 11] </ref>; thus d 0 = k. Lemma 1 The dual distance of the (n; k; n k)-elliptic-code C equals k. fl Let A w and B w denote the number of codewords of weight w of C resp. C ? . The MacWilliams identities [5, Chapter 11] relate these numbers: nj X j A i = q kj i=0 n i ! But since A 0 = B 0 = 1 and A 1 = : : : = A nk1 = B 1 = : : : = B k1 = 0, we get <p> Then we have A nk+r = n ! r1 X (1) j n k + r ! k r A nk Proof Induction on r. fl Remark. Comparing this result with the weight distribution of MDS-codes <ref> [5, Chapter 11, Theorem 6] </ref>, one realizes that the assertion of the theorem remains valid, if one only requests C to be an (n; k; d)-code with d k. Corollary 1 Let C be an (n; k; n k)-elliptic-code. Then we have: 1.

Reference-contexts: should be pointed out that we are merely interested in a constrained version of the above problem since the group (E (F q ); ) is of the type C n fi C m , where C n and C m denote the cyclic groups of orders m and n <ref> [6] </ref>. In the next section we are going to solve the above problem in special cases for the elliptic codes of types I and II. 4 Weight Distribution of Elliptic Codes of Type I Let E be an elliptic curve over F q .

The computation of the exact minimum distance of an elliptic code over the finite field F q leads to the investigation of the group of F q -rational points of the underlying elliptic curve <ref> [7] </ref>. The fact that the dual of an elliptic code C is again an elliptic code can be used to compute the dual distance of C, i.e. the minimum distance of the dual C ? of C. <p> A more thorough treatment can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. For general facts about elliptic curves and function fields the reader 3 can consult [4, 8]. Let E be an elliptic curve defined over the finite field F q . Thus, E is an irreducible smooth algebraic curve of genus one. <p> Proof <ref> [7] </ref>. fl In this paper we shall primarily be concerned with two types of elliptic codes: with the above assumptions, the first class of codes (called codes of type I) consists of codes for which fP 1 ; : : : ; P n g = E (F q ). <p> The second class of codes (called codes of type II) consists of codes for which D = P 1 + + P n1 5 and G = ffP n for some integer ff satisfying 0 &lt; ff &lt; n. The minimum distance of these codes has been determined in <ref> [7] </ref>. 3 Weight Distribution of Elliptic Codes In this section we shall derive explicit formulae for the weight distribution of elliptic codes. Actually, the method involved can be used to determine the weight distribution of any linear code with given dual distance. <p> Then we have A nj+r = n ! r1 X (1) i n j + r ! (1) r (q 1) j r n ! The question, when the code C (G; D) is MDS has been answered in <ref> [7] </ref>. The reformulated result reads as follows. Theorem 4 The code C (G; D) is MDS if and only if E (F q ) ' C 2 fi C 2 and deg (G) = 2 and the trace of G is the neutral element in E (F q ). Proof [7]. <p> <ref> [7] </ref>.

Proof [7]. fl 10 5 Weight Distribution of Elliptic Codes of Type II Let E be an elliptic curve over F q . Denote by P; P 1 ; : : : ; P n all the different F q -rational points of E. <p> The assumptions of the above theorem are satisfied if for example the class group of E is of prime order. In <ref> [7] </ref> necessary and sufficient conditions for C (G; D) to be MDS are given. We are not going to discuss the conditions in detail. 6 The General Problem In this section we are going to outline briefly the general problem of determining the weight distribution of an elliptic code. <p> It is easy to check that ord 1 (G) = ord P 1 (G) = = ord P 6 (G) = 0. Further deg (G) = 4. Let D := 1 + P 1 + + P 6 . According to <ref> [7, Theorem 3] </ref> the code C (G; D) is not MDS. It is a (7; 4; 3) code. <p> By <ref> [7, Theorem 1] </ref> the code C (G; D) is not MDS. Thus C (G; D) is a (6; 4; 2)-code. Taking 1 as the neutral element of E (F 5 ), we have Tr (G) = 1.
