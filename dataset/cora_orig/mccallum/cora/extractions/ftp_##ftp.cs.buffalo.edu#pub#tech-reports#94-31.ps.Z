Title: Impact of Multimedia Data on Workflows

Abstract: Workflow has been used to manipulate the relevant tasks within a group activity in a cooperative environment. Such cooperative work usually demands the creation and exchange of information by means of a wide variety of media, resulting in multimedia workflows. Spatiotem-poral dependencies among tasks represent those new relationships that appear in the multimedia environment. In this paper, we discuss the effects of multimedia data on workflow specification and management in multimedia database systems. Two major types of the spatiotemporal dependencies among tasks, namely, progressive parallel and real-time precedence dependencies, are identified. These spatiotemporal dependencies propose new challenges to the workflow management in multimedia database systems. A Multimedia Workflow Specification and Management Environment (WSME) is to be developed that supports the definition and execution of application-specific multimedia workflows. The WSME provides a multimedia workflow specification language that allows users to define multimedia workflows. In addition, the WSME provides multimedia workflow management mechanisms that maintain synchronized retrievals in a context of multiple data streams. The combination and presentation of continuous data streams in different media, such as images and speech fragments, can only be achieved through a careful synchronization of the ordering of these data streams in the time domain.

Reference-contexts: A workflow model uses a declarative control and data flow specification language to facilitate a separation between the application code on one hand, and the control and data flow among tasks of the application on the other <ref> [BDS + 93] </ref>. <p> Each task may also have alternatives which will be triggered in the event of its failure. The entire workflow thus may not be aborted, even if any of its tasks fails, as long as an alternative finishes. Such alternative relationships have been defined as preference (or contingency) dependency <ref> [BDS + 93, ZNBB94] </ref>. For example, if task t i fails semantically, then task t j is executed as an alternative. When such contingency dependencies are specified among tasks within a workflow, the workflow then contains alternative partial orders, with each partial order representing the execution of the entire workflow. <p> Contingency dependences should also indicate the priority among alternative tasks for selection in completing the execution of the workflow. Other constraints attached to tasks may define termination dependencies or critical task dependencies <ref> [BDS + 93] </ref>. For example, if t j terminates in state st i , then t i must terminate in state st j ; and if t i fails semantically, then the entire workflow must fail. By explicitly specifying termination dependencies, various termination relationships among tasks can be defined.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a media element is termed a "media object." We consider data streams as sequences of time-dependent media elements. We first discuss the question of spatial synchronization of multimedia data. Spatial relationships between media objects are important in image processing <ref> [CYDA88, TPF + 91] </ref>. In the data representation of a two-dimensional image, information related both to position as well as distance must be considered in order to represent the location of a media object.

Reference-contexts: One of the major challenges is to synchronize various types of data in both space and time in order to compose complex multimedia objects. Here, we assume that an object-oriented model is used to represent multimedia data <ref> [Mas91, GBT94] </ref>. A multimedia object may be a combination of real-time data, such as audio and video, with the more conventional text and image data. Real-time data require time-ordered presentation to the user. Thus, a composite multimedia object may involve specific timing relationships among the different types of component media. <p> Both spatial and temporal synchronization are addressed.

Reference-contexts: By explicitly specifying termination dependencies, various termination relationships among tasks can be defined. Critical task dependencies allow us to identify those tasks within workflows which are so distinguished. Recent research in this field has also proposed that chronological dependencies <ref> [GRL93] </ref> be used to impose real-time constraints on tasks. A chronological dependency has been defined by specifying the start time and the expected completion time of a task. In the next section, we will discuss additional dependencies that have not been identified in non-multimedia situations. <p> Similarly, this definition can also be extended to more than two tasks. Real-time precedence dependencies combine precedence relations and time-constraints into a single dependency relationship. Such a chronological dependency was first introduced in <ref> [GRL93] </ref> to impose real-time constraints on tasks. Real-time precedence dependencies define richer meanings than chronological dependencies. Since the parallel and sequential synchronization of media objects engenders a greater complexity of both order and time constraints, chronological dependencies are inadequate to specify such relationships.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) has recently been a very active area for research, development, and production, particularly in distributed environments <ref> [IEE94] </ref>. Within this area, research has been proposed to clearly specify the control and data flow of cooperative activities, which is generally termed workflow.

Reference-contexts: Spatial relationships, such as the relative location of image components, may also require synchronization. The process of coordinating the location and real-time presentation of information and maintaining spatial and time-ordered relationships among component media is known as spatial and temporal synchronization <ref> [LG90] </ref>. Spatial and temporal synchronization among multimedia data will also impact on workflows when cooperative work occurs in a multimedia environment. For example, if two tasks in a workflow retrieve media objects which require synchronization, then the retrieval actions of both tasks must be executed synchronously. <p> Synchronization has been recognized as the central problem to be addresses in the design of multimedia systems <ref> [ENK + 93, LG90, Ste90, LG93] </ref>. Both spatial and temporal synchronization are addressed. Let a media element be a highly structured aggregate of simpler objects, such as video frames, audio samples, or musical notes.
