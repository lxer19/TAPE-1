Abstract: In contrast, we achieve 5 s; a twentyfold improvement. This paper describes the methods and principles used, starting from the architectural design and going down to the coding level. There is no single trick to obtaining this high performance; rather, a synergetic approach in design and implementation on all levels is needed. The methods and their synergy are illustrated by applying them to a concrete example, the L3 -kernel (an industrial-quality operating system in daily use at several hundred sites). The main ideas are to guide the complete kernel design by the ipc requirements, and to make heavy use of the concept of virtual address space inside the -kernel itself.

Reference-contexts: We have overcome the ipc dilemma by carefully constructing a -kernel that more than achieves our aim of a tenfold improvement in ipc performance over comparable systems. 2 Related Work Comparable message based kernels are Amoeba [Mul 84], BirliX [H ar 92], Chorus [Gui 82], and Mach <ref> [Acc 86] </ref>. Ipc improvement was addressed earlier by Cheriton [Che 84a] using registers for short messages. A strictly RPC [Bir 84] oriented ipc system was implemented in DEC's Firefly workstation [Sch 89], the SRC RPC.
