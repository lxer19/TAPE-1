Title: Isoperimetric Functions of Amalgamations of Nilpotent Groups  
Author: Christian Hidber 
Date: January 1998  
Pubnum: TR-98-001  
Abstract: We consider amalgamations of finitely generated nilpotent groups of class c. We show that doubles satisfy a polynomial isoperimetric inequality of degree 2c 2 . Gen-eralising doubles we introduce non-twisted amalgamations and we show that they satisfy a polynomial isoperimetric inequality as well. We give a sufficient condition for amalgamations along abelian subgroups to be non-twisted and thereby to satisfy a polynomial isoperimetric inequality. We conclude by giving an example of a twisted amalgamation along an abelian subgroup having an exponential isoperimetric function.

Reference-contexts: Hence we get an equivalence relation ~ = where f ~ = g if and only if f g and g f . If P and Q are different finite presentations of the same group then P ~ = Q , cf. <ref> [Alo90] </ref>. Any N ! N function equivalent to P is called an isoperimetric function of G, denoted by G . We say that G satisfies a polynomial isoperimetric inequality of degree k if G is bounded above by a polynomial of degree k.

[Far94]. The following results are contained in <ref> [Hid97] </ref>: Let G i for i = 1; 2 be a finitely presented group satisfying a polynomial isoperimetric inequality, H a finitely generated subgroup of G i and G = G 1 fl H G 2 . If H is linearly distorted then G 2 n . <p> There exists a rewriting process 2 from G 2 to H 2 = (H 1 ) relative to a given finite presentation for G 2 and finite set of generators for H 2 such that ffi 2 ffi 1 and 2 1 , cf. <ref> [Hid97] </ref>. Since a group is trivially a retract of itself, upper bounds on the isoperimetric function and the distortion of a rewriting process do not depend up to ~ = -equivalence on a given presentation. <p> Lemma 1 <ref> [Hid97, section 4] </ref> Suppose w 2 G 1 fl H G 2 is a word in the generators of G 1 and G 2 . <p> It is crucial for the proof of proposition 1 to express these upper bounds in terms of j j N i;j , the relative length with respect to N i;j , and not in the full wordlength j j. 10 Theorem 1 <ref> [Hid97, Section 3.2] </ref> Let G be a finitely presented nilpotent group, H a subgroup of G and let G = N 1 N 2 : : : N d N d+1 = f1g be a central series of G such that [N r ; N s ] N r+s for all <p> Hence P (w 1 (w)) KLn 2c for some constant L, yielding G (n) n 2c , c.f. <ref> [Hid97] </ref>. Proposition 1 Let G = G 1 fl H G 2 where G i for i = 1; 2 is a finitely presented nilpotent group and H a subgroup of G i . <p> Theorem 4 Let G be a non-twisted amalgamation of finitely generated nilpotent groups of class c. Then G (n) n 2 (2c+1) c 2 Proof: For c 1 we have G (n) n 2 , c.f. <ref> [BGSS91, Hid97] </ref>. Let c 2 and let G = G 1 fl H G 2 . By theorem 3 there exists a rewriting process from G to H such that ffi (n) n 2 (2c) c and (n) n 2 (2c+1) c+1 . <p> Therefore (ff m ) is not unipotent. Hence we get G (n) ~ = 2 n by theorem 6. 2 Note that the amalgamated subgroup in theorem 7 is exponentially distorted, i.e. ffi H;G (n) ~ = 2 n , cf. <ref> [Hid97] </ref>. Acknowledgement. The results on doubles and the example of a twisted amalgamation are part of my PhD thesis. I would like to thank my advisors U. Stammbach, ETHZ, and G.
