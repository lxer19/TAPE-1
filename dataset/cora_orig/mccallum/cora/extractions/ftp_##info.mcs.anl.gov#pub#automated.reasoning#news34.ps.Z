Abstract: I am also delighted to invite AAR members|and anyone else who wishes to use the (perhaps) first-ever completely push-button theorem prover|to check out Son of Bird Brain at http://www. mcs.anl.gov/home/mccune/ar/sobb/. It lets the user construct some simple conjectures and run them through Otter (for proofs) and MACE (for models and counterexamples), two of Argonne's automated deduction systems|all within a few seconds. It's designed to hook the tyro|and I think it will!

Reference-contexts: IPR handles equality using an incomplete substitution method advocated by Frank Brown <ref> [2] </ref>. IPR also has a very nice interface. When run interactively, the unused formulas from a branch of the tree are presented in English with the header "Suppose" over the positive formulas and "Show one of the following" over the negative formulas.
