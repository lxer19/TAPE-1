Abstract: In its current implementation, the WorldWide Web lacks much of the explicit structure and strong typing found in many closed hypertext systems. While this property probably relates to the explosive acceptance of the Web, it further complicates the already difficult problem of identifying usable structures and aggregates in large hypertext collections. These reduced structures, or localities, form the basis for simplifying visualizations of and navigation through complex hypertext systems. Much of the previous research into identifying aggregates utilize graph theoretic algorithms based upon structural topology, i.e., the linkages between items. Other research has focused on content analysis to form document collections. This paper presents our exploration into techniques that utilize both the topology and textual similarity between items as well as usage data collected by servers and page meta-information lke title and size. Linear equations and spreading activation models are employed to arrange Web pages based upon functional categories, node types, and relevancy. We suggest that the ecological approach of Information Foraging Theory [12] motivates the use of techniques for automatic categorization and a particular kind of associative retrieval of WWW pages involving spreading activation [4]. Categorization techniques are used to identify and rank particular kinds of WWW pages, such as "organization home pages" or "index pages." Associative retrieval techniques identify and rank pages predicted to be related and relevant to currently viewed pages. Both techniques work on the basis of a variety of features of WWW pages, including the text content, usage patterns, inter-page hypertext link topology, and meta-document data such as file size and file name. In combination, these techniques may be used in support of novel information visualization techniques, such as the WebBook [6], to form and present larger aggregates of related WWW pages. We will argue that these techniques can be used to optimize user informationseeking and sensemaking. INFORMATION FORAGING ON THE WWW In an information-rich world, the limiting resource is the time and attention of users. We are developing Information Foraging Theory [12] as an attempt to understand how people adaptively allocate their time and attention in the pursuit and consumption of valuable information. Foraging theory in anthropology [16] and biology [17] attempts to explain how humans and animals optimize their gain of food energy from flux of the physical and organic environment. Similarly, Information Foraging Theory attempts to explain how human informavores optimize their information gain from the flux of the cultural and technological environment. We can think of the WWW as an information environment in which informationseeking users will want optimized foraging technologies. We will argue that categorization and associative retrieval techniques improve the optimality of WWW interactions. Categorizing to Optimize Foraging Decisions We assume a scenario in which a user forages for relevant, valuable information at some web locality, meaning some collection of related WWW pages. Perhaps the pages are related because they are at some particular physical site or WWW server, or perhaps related because they have been collected by a particular community or organization. The optimal selection of WWW pages from the web locality to satisfy a user's information needs is a kind of optimal information diet problem discussed in Pirolli and Card [12]. The overall rate of gaining useful information will be improved by eliminating irrelevant or low-value categories of information from consideration.
