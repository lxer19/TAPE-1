Title: Visual Interactions with a Multidimensional Ranked List

Abstract: Performance analysis of an interactive visualization system generally requires an extensive user study, a method that is very expensive and that often yields inconclusive results. To do a successful user study, the researcher has to be well aware of the system's possibilities. In this paper we present a different kind of analysis. We show how the system behavior and performance could be investigated off-line, without direct user intervention. We introduce an evaluation measure to assess the quality of a multidimensional visualization. Next, we suggest two methods for dealing with user's feedback. We also discuss the effect the dimensionality of the visualization has on the actual performance.

Reference-contexts: The documents are usually presented as points or objects in space with their relative positions indicating how closely they are related. Links are often drawn between highly-related documents to make the fact that there is a relationship clearer. 2.2.1 2-D visualization Allan <ref> [1, 2] </ref> developed a visualization for showing the relationship between documents and parts of documents. It arrayed the documents around an oval and connected them when their similarity was strong enough.

Reference-contexts: Our intent was to study the effect that different types of queries have on the result. For each TREC topic we considered four types of queries: (1) the title of the topic; (2) the description field of the topic; (3) a query constructed by extensive analysis and expansion <ref> [3] </ref>; and (4) a query constructed from the title by expanding it using Local Context Analysis (LCA) [22]. The top 50 documents for each query were selected. Because each query behaved differently there were four different ranked lists for each topic.

Reference-contexts: Again four different types of queries were constructed: (1) the title of the topic; (2) the title and the description field of the topic; (3) the full version constructed by expansion <ref> [4] </ref>; and (4) the expanded version of title query. The same restrictions were imposed on the retrieved set. <p> Given the results of this study, a follow-up user study might be useful to confirm the conclusions. * The suggested visualization method works on average just about as well as a ranked list for finding relevant documents. In another study <ref> [4] </ref> most of the users loved this visualization: they found it intuitive and fun to use.

Reference-contexts: Suppose is the number of points in a unit volume of space, or the intensity of the point field. Let N (h) be the number of extra points within a distance h of a randomly chosen point. Then Barlett <ref> [5] </ref> defines the K function as K (h) = 1 E (N (h)); h 0 (1) Ripley [16, 17] shows that the K function has properties that make it an effective summary of spatial dependence in a point field over wide range of scales.

Reference-contexts: This analysis does not apply in our situation, as we neither create clusters nor create any textual representations. Our approach to evaluation carries some similarity to predictive evaluation (e.g., see Card and Mor-gan <ref> [6] </ref>): we define a precise task (the rapid identification of relevant material) and we evaluate the system particularly for this task. We also assume a set of possible strategies for the user.

Reference-contexts: The user still must select terms, but now the terms are placed on the surface of a sphere rather than the edge of a circle. The additional dimension should allow the user to see separation more readily. Our system is similar in approach to the Bead system <ref> [7] </ref> in that both use forms of spring embedding for placing high-dimensional objects in 3-space. The Bead research did not investigate the question of separating 2 relevant and non-relevant documents.

Reference-contexts: We also show how the ideas behind the K function could be used to extend and adapt the notion of precision to analyze the quality of these structures. 3 4.1 K function The theory of point fields (i.e., point processes) <ref> [8, 18] </ref> introduces a simple and efficient technique for measuring spatial dependencies between different regions of a point pattern 1 . Consider a set of points in a d-dimensional space and a distance function on this space. <p> We then compare these values against the values of the K function for some baseline point field. This baseline point field defines a completely random arrangement of points with neither clustering nor regularity among them, and consequently is called a "random point field". It is customary <ref> [8] </ref> to model the random point field with Poisson point field.

Reference-contexts: It arrayed the documents around an oval and connected them when their similarity was strong enough. Allan's immediate goal was not to find the groups of relevant documents, but to find unusual patterns of relationships between documents. The Vibe system <ref> [10] </ref> is a 2-D display that shows how documents related to each other in terms of user-selected dimensions. The documents being browsed are placed in the center of a circle.

Reference-contexts: In the following text unless otherwise noted we use term "precision" to mean the average spatial precision. 5 5 Experiments For this study we used TREC ad-hoc queries with the corresponding collections and relevance judgments <ref> [12] </ref>. Specifically, TREC topics 251-300 were converted into queries and run against the documents in TREC volumes 2 and 4 (2.1GB). Our intent was to study the effect that different types of queries have on the result.

Reference-contexts: Two decades ago, Croft showed that the top-ranked documents usually contained a "best" cluster|one that had most of the relevant documents.[9] Hearst and Pedersen showed the same effect by using Scatter/Gather to cluster the top-ranked documents presented to searchers.<ref> [13] </ref> 2.1 Textual presentations The Scatter/Gather interface [13] presents the document clusters as text. It groups the documents into five clusters and displays them simultaneously as lists. On a large enough screen, the top several documents from each cluster are clearly visible. <p> The Bead research did not investigate the question of separating 2 relevant and non-relevant documents. Figure 1 shows sample visuals of our system (they are explained in more detail in later sections). 2.3 Evaluation of presentation In their user study, Hearst and Pederson <ref> [13] </ref> showed that users are able to choose the cluster with the largest number of relevant documents using the textual summaries Scatter/Gather creates. This analysis does not apply in our situation, as we neither create clusters nor create any textual representations.

Reference-contexts: The user can shift the location of terms and adjust their weights to better understand the relationships between the documents. 2.2.2 3-D visualization High-powered graphics workstations and the visual appeal of 3-dimensional graphics have encouraged efforts to present document relationships in 3-space. The LyberWorld system <ref> [14] </ref> includes an implementation of the Vibe system described above, but presented in 3-space. The user still must select terms, but now the terms are placed on the surface of a sphere rather than the edge of a circle.

Reference-contexts: It groups the documents into five clusters and displays them simultaneously as lists. On a large enough screen, the top several documents from each cluster are clearly visible. Another text-based visualization is presented by Leouski and Croft. <ref> [15] </ref> Their method is similar to the one used by Scatter/Gather, but does not fix the number of clusters to five.

The main application of the K function is to test if a point field exhibits any structure [18, p. 224].

Reference-contexts: We used a spring embedding approach, that we will briefly summarize here. (A detailed description of the system used can be found elsewhere. <ref> [19] </ref>) Other approaches are entirely possible. The idea of a spring-embedder is to model the objects with steel rings and to simulate inter-object relationship with a spring attached to the corresponding rings, creating a "mechanical" system. The system left to itself oscillates and assumes a minimal energy state.
