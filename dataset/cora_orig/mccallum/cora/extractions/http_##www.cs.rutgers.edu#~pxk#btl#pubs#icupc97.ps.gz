Abstract: Quality of Service (QoS) support for multimedia applications has been widely discussed in the context of high speed wired networks. As interest increases in wireless ATM networks that extend the connection to a wireless endpoint, the issue of QoS over a wireless link has to be addressed. In this paper, we focus on the provision of QoS at the application level in a wireless environment. Our work includes the design of an application programming interface (API) that allows applications to specify and renegotiate the QoS level during a call; as well as the implementation of such API in a wireless ATM testbed: the SWAN system [1]. Experiments are performed to verify the efficiency of this scheme, and the results reveal quality control for multimedia applications despite changing network conditions.

Reference-contexts: In Section 4 we address the major functions provided in our system, while in Section 5 the experimental results are analyzed. Finally, the conclusion and future plans are described in Section 6. 2 The SWAN Environment We used the SWAN (Seamless Wireless ATM Network) system <ref> [1] </ref>, which is a testbed for wireless networked computing. It consists of mobile units which are usually laptops, and base stations which are connected to a backbone network. <p> It is worth noting that a TDD (Time Division Duplex) scheme shown in Fig 2 is used to share the bandwidth between the base station and the mobile host. As described in <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, the traffic of each direction alternatively transmits a data burst of 10 ATM cells at a time and then switches to receiving mode for data from the other direction. <p> The changes of the bandwidth used by the ABR d1 is exactly what we expected in a QoS-guaranteed environment. As a comparison, we repeated the same experiment using UDP which was also developed in <ref> [1] </ref> and doesn't provide any QoS guarantee. The result is shown in Fig. 5. In this figure, we observe that due to the lack of a QoS mechanism, the amount of bandwidth that a connection can utilize is related to how aggressive the traffic source is.

Reference-contexts: Many applications can deal with varying bandwidth availability once provided with sufficient knowledge of the resource climate. Typical examples include audio and video applications which can alter their rate or encoding to match the available bandwidth or deal with different error rates <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. Our contribution is a QoS scheme which builds on this notion of adaptation by providing explicit renegotiation.

All these applications display a significant quality improvement over the original programs that used interface that provided in traditional network protocol (TCP/IP).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This work is motivated by the rising popularity of wireless data networking and the desire for mobile, multimedia communications. Wireless technology has recently begun to take off and it is predicted that the market will reach 600 billion dollars by the year 2010 <ref> [5] </ref>. Wireless networking is inherently unreliable and various forms of interference result in changing bandwidth availability and low effective bandwidths due to high error rates. These problems are exacerbated as users move around.

Reference-contexts: This is similar in spirit to the feedback mechanisms for non real-time traffic in ATM, but differs in that we aim to provide feedback right up to the application level, not just to the sending host <ref> [6] </ref>. Thus we incorporate renegotiation as a key part of our QoS API (application programming interface).

Reference-contexts: It consists of mobile units which are usually laptops, and base stations which are connected to a backbone network. As indicated in Fig. 1, both the base stations and laptops are equipped with a radio interface known as the FAWN (Flexible Adapter for Wireless Networking) <ref> [7] </ref> card that allows them to communicate with each other wirelessly. Each base station has a range of 100 feet inside a building, providing access to a local area network for mobiles in its vicinity.
