Title: Approximation Algorithms for the Class Steiner Tree Problem  
Author: Jeffery Westbrook Dicky Yan 
Date: February, 1994  
Abstract: The class Steiner tree problem (CSP) [18, 19, 29] is a generalization of the well known Steiner tree problem (STP) [17, 35]; one is given a weighted undirected graph in which the nodes are partitioned into g classes of terminals or required nodes. A minimum size tree that includes at least one node from each class is required. CSP is MAX SNP-hard even on a tree [19]. We show that CSP can be reduced to STP and obtain approximation and optimization algorithms from the reduction. For any constant h 2 Z +1 , we provide a polynomial time algorithm that has a performance ratio less than (2 + dg=(h + 1)e). We obtain approximation algorithms with performance ratios of: (1) O(g 11=d ) in the rectilinear and Euclidean d-spaces, (2) (2 1=bg=2c) for the class channel [20] and switchbox [30] Steiner problems, (3) constant when one side of a uniform grid is bounded. We show that CSP can be solved in linear time and space on cographs with uniform edge weights. We find that the problem becomes more difficult when the classes are not required to be disjoint.

Reference-contexts: CSP is not easy to approximate either. Ihler [19] shows that CSP is MAX SNP-hard even when G is a tree of bounded diameter by using a reduction from the minimum set cover problem. From recent results for the minimum set cover problem <ref> [2] </ref>, this reduction implies that unless P=NP, no polynomial time algorithm can approximate CSP within a constant ratio; furthermore, unless NPDTIME (n poly log n ), there does not exist a polynomial time algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio better than (log g) for CSP.

The algorithm runs in polynomial time if h is a constant. For large g, this is an improvement over the Ihler's <ref> [18] </ref> (g h + 1)-approximate algorithm. Our algorithm relies on the existence of a good partition of the optimal tree into h subtrees. We study CSP in the Euclidean and rectilinear d-spaces, where d is a constant.

Reference-contexts: We find that if the classes are not required to be disjoint, CSP becomes becomes MAX SNP-hard (and NP-hard) for a larger class of graphs. The next Theorem can be proved by using a reduction from the vertex cover problem which is MAX SNP-hard <ref> [28] </ref> and NP-hard [14] even if the graph instance has bounded node degree. (A similar result can also be obtained by modifying Ihler's proof for CSP with disjoint classes [19] which is based on a reduction from the minimum set cover problem.) This is one of the few NP-hard problems for

Reference-contexts: The problem is to find a tree of minimum total edge weight that includes all the nodes in Z. The problem and its corresponding versions on the rectilinear and Euclidean planes are NP-hard [13, 14, 25]. Reich and Widmayer <ref> [29] </ref> propose a generalization of the Steiner tree problem called the class (or group) Steiner tree problem (CSP). Let G = (V; E) be a weighted undirected graph with V partitioned into sets R 1 ; : : : ; R g and S. <p> Each R i represents different possible positions of a pin in a computer chip layout and the Steiner tree represents a net used to connect pins from different chips <ref> [20, 29] </ref>. CSP is NP-hard since it contains the Steiner tree problem as a special case when each jR i j = 1. NP-hardness results indicate that CSP is a more difficult problem than STP.

Reference-contexts: This is the first polynomial time approximation algorithm for any one of these metric spaces with a sublinear performance ratio. Let n be the number of required nodes. Our algorithm runs in O (n 2 log n) time and requires O (n 2 ) space. Ihler [20] and Reich <ref> [30] </ref> study the class channel and the class switchbox Steiner tree problems which are derived from channel routing and switchbox routing problems in VLSI design. <p> The class channel and switchbox problems can be reduced to a class Steiner tree problem on a grid graph, G, where all n required nodes lie on the boundary G <ref> [20, 30] </ref>. Given any Steiner tree T in G, we use B (T ) to represent the smallest rectangle or box that encloses T (see Figure 1 (a)), and (B (T )) its perimeter.

Reference-contexts: Klein and Ravi [26] reduce CSP to the directed Steiner tree problem. Since the minimum set cover problem can also be reduced to the directed Steiner tree problem, similar lower bounds as before hold for any attempt to approximate CSP using their reduction. Furthermore, Vo <ref> [33] </ref> shows that all the common heuristics for the directed Steiner tree problem have no better than a linear approximation ratio. Ihler [18] gives a polynomial time approximation algorithm for CSP on general graphs with a performance ratio of (g 1).

Reference-contexts: The proofs in [19, 21] imply that CSP on graphs with uniform edge weights is NP-hard for the following types of graphs for which STP can be solved in polynomial time: directed path graphs, strongly chordal graphs, partial k-trees, and distance-hereditary graphs, among others <ref> [3, 17, 22, 34] </ref>. CSP is not easy to approximate either. Ihler [19] shows that CSP is MAX SNP-hard even when G is a tree of bounded diameter by using a reduction from the minimum set cover problem.

STP on graphs with unit edge weights is sometimes called the minimum cardinality Steiner problem, and has been much studied [22].
