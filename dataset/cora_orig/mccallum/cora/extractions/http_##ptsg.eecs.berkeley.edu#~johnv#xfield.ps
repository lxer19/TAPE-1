Abstract: The transmitted current in a crossed-fleld gap has been characterized analytically by a number of authors [1], [4], [6] and [7]. Using a one dimensional PIC simulation, PDP1 [9], we explore the behavior of the crossed-fleld diode at B = B Hull . For mono-energetic (cold) emission, a rapid reduction of transmitted current is observed when the injected current exceeds the critical current by just 1%. Addition of a small electron temperature normal to the cathode eliminates the transition, even for kT=V 10 5 (V = 10 kV, gap = 1 cm, B = 337 G, J = 1:69 A/cm 2 ), while an isotropic velocity distribution accelerates the transition.
