Abstract: Real time multicast video distribution is an important component of many multimedia applications. Our work addresses the fairness problem in feedback-controlled mul-ticast video distribution systems over best effort networks (such as the Internet). In previous work we proposed, implemented and experimented with a scheme, called destination set grouping (DSG), where a source maintains a small number of video streams (say 3), carrying the same video but each targeted at receivers with different capabilities. Each stream is feedback-controlled within prescribed limits by its group of receivers. Receivers may move among groups as their capabilities or the capabilities of the network paths leading to them change. In this paper we focus on the potential for network overloading caused by the transmission of multiple replicated streams. We propose a number of mechanisms to be implemented at the source and the receivers that can help avert this problem. We also describe an evaluation of these schemes using simulation, and discuss a comparison of replicated stream versus layered encoding approaches.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Real time multicast video distribution is an important component of many multimedia applications. Approaches proposed to dealing with the real-time aspect of video distribution fall in one of two categories: 1) the use of a network capable of resource reservation to provide performance guarantees <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4] </ref> and 2) the use of feedback control to adjust video stream requirements to meet current network capabilities [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. This latter approach, which has been the focus of our work [5], is more compatible with the near-term architecture and capabilities of the Internet.

In a feedback-controlled video distribution scheme, receivers judge the quality of the video they are receiving (e.g., through measuring packet loss rate) and if that is not acceptable, the source is informed through feedback messages. <p> In contrast, using a single multicast stream has good bandwidth economy, but very low granularity of control; the setting of communication parameters may not be optimal for many of the receivers. In <ref> [5] </ref> we proposed, implemented and experimented with a system that spans the spectrum represented by the two extremes above. In the scheme, called destination set grouping (DSG), a source maintains a small number of video streams (say 3), carrying the same video but each targeted at receivers with different capabilities. <p> An inter-stream or stream change protocol used by receivers to change to a higher or lower quality stream as their needs change. This protocol is described in detail in <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> Our protocol has been implemented and the results of an experiment can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. 3 The Replicated Stream Problem For the purposes of this paper, the feature of interest in the DSG protocol is its use of multiple replicated video streams. <p> Controlling the overall bandwidth will help minimize problems that may be caused by replicated streams. We propose the following bandwidth estimation technique. For each stream i, the source determines the maximum hop distance to its receivers Lmax i using the DSG's protocol maximum TTL estimation technique <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> We also briefly discussed our ideas in incorporating layered encoding schemes with DSG protocols and compared it with the replicated streams approach. We will incorporate the two approaches into our working prototype of the DSG protocol and perform experiments over the Mbone (similar to the experiments we reported in <ref> [5] </ref>.) This will help us gauge the complexity of implementation and the overhead represented by the proposed protocols.

We also use a slightly modified version of the probabilistic feedback technique <ref> [7, 11] </ref> to avoid feedback implosion. Note that some video streams maintained by the source may not have any listeners (because its quality does not match any receiver's requirements). Such streams are deactivated and the corresponding video is not transmitted. <p> The DSG protocol has two main components: 1. An intra-stream protocol used by receivers listening to the same stream to adjust the data rate of the stream within its prescribed limits. For this we use a variation on the protocol described in <ref> [7] </ref>. An independent feedback control mechanism used within each stream. Each receiver estimates its video reception quality using its packet loss rate. Based on this, receivers can be in any one of three states: UNLOADED, LOADED and CONGESTED. <p> The source also has an estimate of the number of receivers N i to each stream <ref> [7] </ref>. All the four parameter estimates above are updated periodically. Denote the data rate being transmitted on stream i as B i .

Reference-contexts: All streams carry the same video but compressed with different parameters resulting in differing video quality and data rates. The video quality within each stream can also be adjusted within a prescribed range. For example, in our implementation, the source maintains three MPEG <ref> [10] </ref> encoded video streams with video quality and data rates being controlled by the choice of quantization scale factor. Low, medium and high quality streams can correspond to the quantization scale factor ranges [24..31], [16..23] and [8..15], respectively 1 .
