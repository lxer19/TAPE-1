Abstract: A priority queue transforms an input permutation p 1 of a totally ordered set of size n into an output permutation p 2 . Atkinson and Thiyagarajah showed that the number of such pairs (p 1 ; p 2 ) is (n + 1) n1 , which is well known to be the number of labeled trees on n + 1 vertices. We give a new proof of this result by finding a bijection from such pairs of permutations to labeled trees.

Reference-contexts: Atkinson and Thiyagarajah [1] showed that the number of allowable pairs for S is (n + 1) n1 . It is well known that this is also the number of labeled trees on a set of n + 1 vertices. (See, for example, Knuth <ref> [2, x2.3.4.4] </ref>.) In this paper we prove Atkinson and Thiyagarajah's result by constructing a bijection from the set of allowable pairs for S to the set of labeled trees on the set S [ frg, where r is some nonelement of S. <p> we get 1 log (tF (x) + 1 t) = xF (x) tF (x) + 1 t = e txF (x) : Replacing txF (x) by f (x), we get f (x) = x (e f (x) + t 1): (2) By the Lagrange inversion formula (see, for example, Knuth <ref> [2, p. 392] </ref>), we have [x n ]f = n for n 1, where [x n ] denotes the coefficient of x n . <p> Thus for n &gt; 0, [x n ]f = n k=0 n ! = n k=0 n !

(This result may also be derived from Knuth <ref> [2, exercise 19, p. 397; solution, p. 585] </ref> or from Moon [4, Theorem 3.5, p. 20].)

Reference-contexts: A Delete-Minimum operation, which can be performed when the priority queue is nonempty, removes the least element in the priority queue and places it at the end of the output sequence. For a full discussion of priority queues, see Knuth <ref> [3] </ref>. Now let us suppose that the input sequence is a permutation of a totally ordered set S of size n. Then the output sequence is also a permutation of S.

Reference-contexts: 8 10 7 9)): It may be noted that in the case in which T is increasing, so that only one DFS is performed, p 2 is the unique increasing permutation of S and reduces to a well-known bijection from increasing rooted labeled trees to permutations.

T , we first describe a function that associates to an allowable pair (p 1 ; p 2 ) a sequence of Insert and Delete-Minimum operations that transforms p 1 to p 2 .
