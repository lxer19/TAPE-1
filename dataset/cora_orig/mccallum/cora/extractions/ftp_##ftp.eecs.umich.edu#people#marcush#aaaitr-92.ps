Reference-contexts: In this way, the VFH algorithm produces a sufficiently detailed spatial representation of the robot's environment for travel among densely cluttered obstacles, without compromising the system's real-time performance <ref> [1, 2] </ref>.

A fuzzy predicate can be partially true in a given state of the world. Namely, a fuzzy predicate has a number in the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref> as its truth value, with 0 standing for complete falseness, 1 for complete truth, and intermediate values for partial satisfaction. E.g.,"close" has truth value 0.5 if distance is 700 mm (see Figure 9).

Reference-contexts: Sonar B is unable to distinguish this from its own reflected signal. errors, rendering these errors detectable by the method of comparison of consecutive readings <ref> [3] </ref>. Since EERUF practically eliminates the problem of crosstalk, it allows for very fast firing rates. With EERUF, a mobile robot with 24 ultrasonic sensors can fire all sensors within a period of 60 ms.

Reference-contexts: The perceptual and control architecture makes constant reference to the local perceptual space. The diagram of Figure 4 shows the major components. In Brooks' terms <ref> [4] </ref>, the organization is partly vertical and partly horizontal. The vertical organization occurs in both perceptual (left side) and action (right side).
Reference: [5] <author> Charles Cohen and Frank Koss. </author> <title> A comprehensive study of three-object triangulation. </title> <booktitle> In SPIE Mobile Robots VII, </booktitle> <year> 1992. </year>
Reference-contexts: A better solution for absolute positioning is one that uses objects already found in the environment (i.e. landmarks), in this case the object poles. The method used on CARMEL for triangulation is based on circle intersection (see <ref> [5] </ref> for an overview of three-object absolute-positioning algorithms). Given objects A, B, and C, a circle is formed with objects A, B, and the angle between them as viewed from the robot, as shown in Figure 15. <p> A second circle is formed similarily with objects B, C, and the angle between them. The two circles intersect at two points: object B's location and the robot's location. Therefore, the robot's location and orientation can be determined. As in most triangulation methods (see <ref> [5] </ref>), this method is affected by errors in an object's location and angle measurement. Error in the angular separation between objects was less than 1 degree; object distance was similarly quite accurate, typically within 2% of the actual distance.

Reference-contexts: This paper is intended to compare the two architectures, focusing on abilities exhibited in the robot competition and the underlying approaches used by the two teams.

Reference-contexts: A shorter version of this paper appeared originally in [6]. 1.1 Competition Overview An AI Magazine article by competition organizers Tom Dean and Pete Bonasso <ref> [7] </ref> describes in detail the rules, scoring, and final standings of the 1992 AAAI Robot Competition. Briefly, the competition consisted of three stages. In Stage 1, each robot was required to roam through an octagonal arena roughly 21 meters in diameter, avoiding people and obstacles. <p> Thus, Flakey could keep moving even as it was looking for objects and updating its map; it was the only robot except for Scarecrow (see <ref> [7] </ref>) that never stopped moving during all stages of the competition. The modular and distributed design of the system means that it is both flexible and extensible.

Reference-contexts: To map the obstacles in the environment, CARMEL uses another innovative approach called a Vector Field Histogram (VFH). One of the most popular approaches to obstacle avoidance is based on the principle of potential fields. However, in the course of experimentation with this method, Koren and Borenstein <ref> [8] </ref> found that at higher speeds potential-field methods will inherently cause oscillations when travelling near obstacles or in narrow 13 (a) (b) data from ultrasonic range sensors. In (a) above, CARMEL is at a start location, and heading roughly northeast.

Reference-contexts: many years for a mobile robot to become an "everyday" research resource on which more complicated tasks can be implemented. 8.5 Geometric path-planning It is surprising that neither team used any geometric planning for navigation around obstacles to a goal point, although this is a large area of robotics research <ref> [9] </ref>. Instead, they relied on the simple strategy of heading towards the goal and using reactive behavior to avoid obstacles, with very simple methods for getting out of cul-de-sac situations. Geometric planning requires some sophistication in perception and mapping of obstacles, and can be difficult to perform in real time.

Reference-contexts: The combination of EERUF and VFH is uniquely suited to high-speed obstacle avoidance (CARMEL travelled at speeds of up to 780 mm/sec in the competition). Manz, Liscano, and Green <ref> [10] </ref> showed that VFH fares favorably when comparted to several other obstacle avoidance methods. 2.1.2 Obstacle avoidance: Flakey Flakey uses two basic techniques for obstacle avoidance.

Reference-contexts: Each cell in the histogram grid holds a certainty value that represents the confidence of the algorithm in the existence of an obstacle at that location. This representation was derived from the certainty grid concept that was originally developed by Moravec and Elfes <ref> [11] </ref>. In the histogram grid, certainty values are incremented when the range reading from an ultrasonic sensor indicates the presence of an object at that cell. Based on data in the histogram grid, the VFH method creates an intermediate data representation called the polar histogram.

Reference-contexts: Wall candidates are found using straight-line segments extracted from the side sonar data. In Figure 16, a strong wall candidate has been found and marked with a "W." The filtering process <ref> [12] </ref> evaluates candidates for the likelihood of them being an actual wall.

Reference-contexts: Time-critical behaviors such as obstacle avoidance rely on very simple processing of the sensors because this information is available quickly; however, these routines may also make use of other information when it is available, e.g., prior information about expected obstacles that comes from the map <ref> [13] </ref>. To navigate through extended regions, Flakey uses a tolerant global map that contains prior, imprecise spatial knowledge of objects in the domain.

Reference-contexts: Control actions typically refer to forward velocity and angular orientation, by sending the appropriate set-point to Flakey's motor controller. A detailed description of Flakey's fuzzy controller is contained in <ref> [14] </ref>. The rules are organized into sets called behaviors in a modular fashion. For example, one set of four rules deals with emergency maneuvers when there is an obstacle very close to Flakey (the Protect behavior). The modular organization has several advantages. <p> This rule set is typically combined with other rule sets (or sub-behaviors) that take care of other, concurrent goals (e.g., avoid obstacles along the way). Combination of concurrent goals, or behavior blending, is performed using the methods of fuzzy logic <ref> [14] </ref>. Figure 18 shows the result of blending a wall-following behavior with an obstacle-avoidance behavior (here, Keep-Off). Context-dependent blending of different behaviors allows Flakey to exhibit reliable operation in unstructured dynamic environments. Coordinating purposeful activities to accomplish complicated goals requires yet another level of control.
