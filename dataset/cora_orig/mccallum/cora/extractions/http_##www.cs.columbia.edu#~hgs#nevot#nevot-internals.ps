Abstract: This division into modules simplifies the creation of integrated multimedia applications consisting of several media handlers. For example, a single join panel could be used to create both audio and video sessions. The basic approach is outlined in [2]. Other uses include the integration of the media handler with WorldWide Web browsers such as Mosaic. The daemon could also be modified to be integrated as a library into other applications or as a CORBA server. It may make sense to use it as the audio server in distributed X-like audio systems like AudioFile [3, 4] or the NCD Network Audio System [5].

Reference-contexts: In SunOS, for example, a separate device /dev/audioctl may be used to set these parameters through ioctl () calls. In NEVOT, this functionality is handled by external applications. 0.8 Program Control NEVOT is controlled through ASCII commands <ref> [2] </ref>. Depending on the configuration variable controller, these commands can come through a TCP port (with NEVOT connecting to the given port), a UDP port, or stdio.

Reference-contexts: Its main purpose is to suppress background noise and reduce network load during multi-participant conferences. The adaptive silence detector is borrowed from the VT (voice tool) and described in <ref> [7, p. 6,7] </ref>. It computes a measure reflecting the average sample amplitude of the packet and declares it silent if this energy measure is below the current threshold.

Reference-contexts: For -law audio, the energy measure is the average of the sign-stripped sample values and is really a geometric mean since the sum of logarithms is equivalent to the product of the sample values). The geometric average is known to be no greater than the mean <ref> [8, p. 293] </ref>. For linearly encoded audio, we apply a -law transformation to the sample average so that we again arrive at scaled amplitude values of between 0 and 127.

Reference-contexts: Other, more elaborate voice activity detectors, could be used. Of particular interest is the one used in the GSM audio codec, as it is based on energy measures and spectral information already computed within the GSM codec <ref> [9] </ref>. A somewhat simpler, non-adaptive silence detector is used by ivs: If any -law sample within the audio packet exceeds a given threshold, the packet is declared non-silent. At the beginning of each talkspurt, a setable number of the blocks preceding the first non-silent blocks is transmitted.

Reference-contexts: The delay variance is estimated as the absolute difference between the current estimated mean delay and the delay sample. The first absolute moment is considered a more robust estimator and not as sensitive to outliers as the standard deviation. For normal random variables, it is known <ref> [10, p. 111] </ref> that E [jxj] = 2= = 0:798: Note that this differs from the conclusion drawn in [11, p. 325].

At the beginning of a talkspurt, several packets are sent in close succession, namely the packet whose energy level triggered the silence detector plus a fixed number of packets stored to limit front clipping. <p> This fixed-point arithmetic limits the effect of round-off errors. The same basic filter is used by TCP in the round trip time estimator [14, p. 188,192], [15, p. 278] and was suggested by Van Jacobson <ref> [11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: AGC adjustment takes place only during silent periods. VU meters measure the short-term energy with a well-described frequency response <ref> [13] </ref>: the display should reach 99% of full scale 300 ms after applying the corresponding full-scale level, with an overshoot of between 1 and 1.5 %.
