Abstract: Segmentation of medical imagery is a challenging problem due to the complexity of the images, as well as to the absence of models of the anatomy that fully capture the possible deformations in each structure. In this paper, we present a method for segmentation of a particularly complex structure, the brain tissue, from MRI. Our method is a combination of three existing techniques from the Computer Vision literature: adaptive segmentation, binary morphology, and active contour models. Each of these techniques has been customized for the problem of brain tissue segmentation from gradient echo images, and the resultant method is more robust than its components. We present the results of a parallel implementation of this method on IBM's supercomputer Power Visualization System for a database of 10 brains each with 256x256x124 voxels.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We are interested in the problem of segmentation of brain tissue from magnetic resonance images, which is an interesting and important step for many medical imaging applications (see <ref> [1] </ref> for examples). <p> See <ref> [1] </ref> for details of the model. Gain Correction: Initially, we use Adaptive Segmentation to correct for the gain introduced in the data by the imaging equipment. We use a single channel, non-parametric, multi-class implementation of the segmenter that is described in [3]. <p> The validation problem is explored in more detail in <ref> [1] </ref>, [3].

Reference-contexts: The third technique, binary morphology is a standard image processing operation that is discussed in detail in [2]. 2.1 Adaptive Segmentation Adaptive Segmentation is a recently developed, powerful technique for simultaneous tissue classification and gain field estimation in magnetic resonance images <ref> [3] </ref>. Traditional intensity based segmentation relies on elements of the same tissue type having MR intensities that are clustered around a mean characteristic value, and relies on each cluster being well separated from other tissue clusters. <p> See [1] for details of the model. Gain Correction: Initially, we use Adaptive Segmentation to correct for the gain introduced in the data by the imaging equipment. We use a single channel, non-parametric, multi-class implementation of the segmenter that is described in <ref> [3] </ref>. Training points are used for white matter, grey matter, csf and skin, and therefore the resultant tissue classifications correspond to these four classes. The output of this stage is a set of classified voxels. <p> The validation problem is explored in more detail in [1], <ref> [3] </ref>. Two views from a 3D reconstruction of the results of our segmenter on a representative data set are shown in the top row of Figure 1, and the same views reconstructed from a manual segmentations for the same data set are shown in the bottom row of the figure.

Reference-contexts: A special class of deformable contours called snakes was introduced by Witkin, Kass and Terzopoulos <ref> [4] </ref> in which the initial position is specified interactively by the user and the objective function is referred to as the energy of the snake.

Reference-contexts: As dv dt tends to zero, we get a solution to the system Av = F . Formulating this evolution problem using finite differences with time step t , we obtain a system of the form <ref> [5] </ref>: (I + t A)v t = v t1 + t F (v t1 ) ; (4) where v t denotes the position vector of the snake at time t, and I is the identity matrix. <p> The system is considered to have reached equilibrium when the difference between v t and v t1 is below some threshold. The balloon model for deformable contours is introduces improvements on the snake model <ref> [5] </ref>. It modifies the the snake energy to include a "balloon" force, which can either be an inflation force, or a deflation force.
