Abstract: Decision feedback sequence estimation (DFSE), which is a reduced-complexity alternative to maximum likelihood sequence estimation, performs very well for whitened (minimum-phase) inter-symbol interference (ISI) channels. However, it may not be feasible to compute the whitening filter for many time-varying channels like the multiuser asynchronous direct-sequence CDMA channel. Moreover, the performance of DFSE is not very good for many non-minimum-phase whitened ISI channels and for channels for which it is desirable to perform bidirectional equalization as in the GSM system. In these scenarios, it is beneficial to use the Ungerboeck formulation for sequence estimation which operates directly on the discrete-time un-whitened statistic obtained from conventional matched filtering. In this paper, we show that conventional decision-feedback sequence estimation in the Ungerboeck form is interference limited. An error probability analysis leads us to a modified unwhitened decision feedback sequence estimator (MUDFSE). Simulation results indicate that the modified algorithm used on unwhitened ISI channels with low to moderate dispersion, provides similar performance/complexity tradeoffs as the DFSE used on the corresponding whitened minimum-phase channels. The algorithm is especially attractive for multiuser detection for asynchronous DS-CDMA channels with long spreading codes, where it obtains sizable gains over the (unwhitened) M-algorithm.

However, there is an important distinction in the definition of error events for MUDFSE and MLSE. A valid error sequence for J-order MUDFSE (1 J L) can have no more than J 1 consecutive zeros according to the definition in (15), whereas J = L for MLSE. <p> This sharp contrast between the behavior of MUDFSE and DFSE is consistent with the fact that the operation of matched filtering collects all the energy of the pulse transmitted at time n into the corresponding output sample y n <ref> [2] </ref>, while the operation of noise whitening results in the scattering of some of this energy into subsequent output samples. 6 Performance results Performance is evaluated via simulation.

Reference-contexts: In the GSM system, training sequences are inserted in the middle of the burst to aid channel estimation. Equalization over the data field is then performed bi-directionally starting out from the training sequence <ref> [5] </ref>. If the channel response is minimum-phase in one direction, it is maximum-phase in the other. DFSE performs poorly in maximum-phase conditions. Decision feedback sequence estimation can be employed for multiuser detection. <p> However, noise whitening in a time-varying environment [6] is computationally expensive. Ungerboeck's formulation for sequence estimation is better suited in conditions such as mentioned above. A reduced-state Ungerboeck variant to DFSE, which we call unwhitened decision feedback sequence estimation (UDFSE), was derived in [7] 2 and <ref> [5] </ref>. It operates on discrete-time unwhitened statistics obtained from conventional matched filtering and is thus insensitive to channel phase. However, the scheme does not perform as well as DFSE on most channels. The problem arises from the nature of unwhitened statistics which depend on both past and future input symbols.

The proposed modified UDFSE schemes outperform the other methods and converge to MLSE in high multiuser interference. 7 Conclusions In this paper, we show that conventional decision feedback sequence estimation with the Ungerboeck formulation as proposed in <ref> [7] </ref> (for unwhitened ISI channels) is interference-limited. We derive a modified un-whitened decision feedback sequence estimation algorithm which alleviates this problem. On channels with low-to-moderate dispersion, the algorithm provides excellent performance/complexity tradeoffs. The algorithm is insensitive to channel phase and does not require noise-whitening.
