Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in inferring the sources of various types of sonar features typically observed by a mobile robot. After a brief discussion of terrestrial sonar sensing, we develop a set of operators that associates arc-shaped features extracted from sonar scans with real world primitives. Our classification scheme is probabilistic and is based on empirical data: the confidence of the association hypotheses produced by the operators is evaluated statistically. Some of our experimental results suggest that methods based on models of perfect sonar sensors may not be completely consistent with observed data. The management and merging of a collection of hypotheses concerning various sonar features allows the system to produce a coherent and mutually-compatible set of inferences for the entire observed environment.

Reference-contexts: The most common models for sonar data involve representing a sonar echo as a data point at a distance given by the time of flight along a line normal to the transducer. Collections of these data points are then used to build a grid-based environment model <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, or modeled using linear geometric primitives. Under the best conditions, some of these geometric models match physical structures in the environment while others are the results of echos that have bounced on several surfaces.

However, these models predict that edge RCD widths is a function of the distance from which they are observed [7]: we have not observed this dependence on our edge prototypes: this may relate to the fact that our experimental data was collected in an environment several meters wide. * As for multi-bounce RCDs, their width never exceeds 25 ffi and has a peak around 10 ffi . <p> It is difficult to predict how multi bounce RCDs will relate without knowing the surfaces which generated them.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this model would be optimistic even for a laser range sensor. However, the understanding of the physics of sound waves has permitted faithful modeling of sonar sensing devices <ref> [8, 9, 10] </ref>. We briefly review here the properties of this model, as they play a critical role in the development of our technique. Beam width: A nominal range estimate can be obtained directly from the delay time in the reception of an acoustic echo. <p> Diffraction: When the sonar beam hits an edge, it is diffracted: the resulting echo wave spreads cylindrically from the corner. The signal received by the sensor has then a much lower amplitude than the echo produced by a wall since the energy is dissipated widely <ref> [8] </ref>. The maximal distance from which an edge can be perceived is then smaller than for walls. <p> However, we establish in this section that statistical analyses of the attributes of a single RCD scan can be used to determine its causative source, sometimes with high confidence. 3.1 RCDs classification According to <ref> [8] </ref>, only edges can be differentiated from corners or planes using the angular width of an RCD (in an occlusion-free environment). But an analysis of empirical sonar data scans reveals that the angular width can lead to a better differentiation.

Reference-contexts: As a consequence, the sonar beam is reflected away from the transducer for surfaces that are not almost facing it. In this case, either no echo is detected by the receiver, or an echo corresponding to multiple reflections with other objects is detected <ref> [11] </ref> (Figure 1). The latter case is known as the "multiple reflection" phenomenon, and produces totally erroneous range measurements. Depending on the number n of object encountered during the beam propagation, the sonar echo is said to be a n th order echo [6].

Reference-contexts: Using wave propagation theory, R. Kuc showed that the width of the corresponding arc should be smaller than for walls and corners <ref> [12] </ref>. Our technique is based on statistically-observed properties of individual RCDs in the sonar scan. RCDs are extracted by the application of a threshold on the distance between successive range data points.
