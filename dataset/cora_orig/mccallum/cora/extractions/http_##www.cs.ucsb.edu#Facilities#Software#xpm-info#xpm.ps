Reference-contexts: The original idea of this format comes from Daniel Dardailler and Colas Nahaboo who designed the first version in 1989. While Daniel wanted to take out from UIL 1 <ref> [Motif] </ref> the icon format, Colas thought it would be nice to do this in a way allowing to include the pixmap files in a C program just like XBM 2 files. Thus, Daniel developed and distributed in February 1989 the first version of the XPM library.

Reference-contexts: Transparency is supported by the XPM library by providing a masking bitmap in addition to the pixmap. This mask can then be used either as a clip-mask of 9 XPM Manual an Xlib GC, or a shape-mask of a window using the X11 Nonrectangular Window Shape Extension <ref> [XShape] </ref>. The &lt;Pixels&gt; section is composed by &lt;height&gt; strings of &lt;width&gt; * &lt;chars_per_pixel&gt; characters, where every &lt;chars_per_pixel&gt; length string must be one of the previously defined groups in the &lt;Colors&gt; section. Then follows the &lt;Extensions&gt; section which must be labeled, if not empty, in the &lt;Values&gt; section as previously described.
