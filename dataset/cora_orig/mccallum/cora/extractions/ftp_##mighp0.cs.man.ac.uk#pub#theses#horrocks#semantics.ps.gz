Reference-contexts: In most description logics (such as Classic [6], Loom [5] or Back [7]) terminological axioms are restricted to allow names to appear only once on the left hand side of an axiom and to forbid recursive definitions; given these restrictions a primitive interpretation leads to a unique extension <ref> [2] </ref>. Subsumption between arbitrary concept terms can then be defined as: C 1 &lt; C 2 if and only if C I 1 C I As the restriction on names is not imposed in Grail the unique extension property no longer holds. <p> The question then arises as to which extensions should be considered when evaluating subsumption relationships.

Reference-contexts: Concept and role terms can then be used in terminological axioms to add information to the knowledge base. 2 Model Theoretic Semantics Terminological subsumption inferences in Grail are justified by the usual Tarski style model theoretic semantics <ref> [8] </ref>. Concepts, roles and attributes (single valued roles) are taken to refer to sets of objects in the domain of interest and the relationships between them. A terminology is based on a set of primitives from which more complex expressions can be formed.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Like other description logics (c.f. <ref> [9] </ref>) the Grail language is based on primitive concepts, roles and attributes from which more complex terms can be formed using a variety of operators.
