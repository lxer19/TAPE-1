Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we introduce an overlapping mortar finite element methods for solving two-dimensional elliptic problems discretized on overlapping non-matching grids. We prove an optimal error bound and estimate the condition numbers of certain overlapping Schwarz preconditioned systems for the two-subdomain case. We show that the error bound is independent of the size of the overlap and the ratio of the mesh parameters. In the second part, we introduce three additive Schwarz preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithms based on the trivial and harmonic extensions. We provide estimates for the spectral bounds on the condition numbers of the preconditioned operators. We show that although the error bound is independent of the size of the overlap, the condition number does depend on it. Numerical examples are presented to support our theory.

Reference-contexts: The curve fl i has two sides. We refer to one of them as the mortar side, and the other as the non-mortar side. In most mortar element methods, see e.g. <ref> [7] </ref>, the choice is rather arbitrary. In our case, we have only one choice. For fl 1 , we define the T h 2 side as the mortar side and the T h 1 side as the non-mortar side. <p> theorem for w, we deduce that fi fi fi fl 1 @n fi fi fi Ckwk h inf 2 ~ W h 1 (fl 1 ) &lt; fl fl fl @n fl fl fl 9 ; With the help of Lemma 3 (or Lemma 4.1 of Bernardi, Maday and Patera <ref> [7] </ref>), we obtain fi fi fi fl 1 @n fi fi fi t 1 fl fl fl @n fl fl H 1=2+t 1 (fl 1 ) t 1 fl 11 5. Technical lemmas. In this section, we discuss several technical estimates. <p> We formulate and prove some of the lemmas in a way that is more general than needed in this paper since we believe their applicabilities go beyond this paper. The proof of the following lemma can be found in Bernardi, Maday and Patera <ref> [7] </ref>, although their definition of the mortar mapping is slightly different from ours for Case L because of the two extra intervals [a i 0 ; a i m i ; a i m i +1 ].

Reference-contexts: There are also several methods that use overlapping non-matching grid preconditioners for matrix problems obtained from non-overlapping discretization schemes; see [12, 15]. Some very interesting recent development in using overlapping non-matching grid methods can be found, for examples, in the papers of Kuznetsov [23], Blake <ref> [8] </ref> and Cai, Mathew and Sarkis [10]. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that provides an optimal error analysis for the overlapping mortar element method. To avoid unnecessary complications, we restrict our discussion to Poisson's equation with zero Dirichlet boundary condition.

Reference-contexts: Now we follow the proofs of Theorems 3.2 and 3.4 of Bramble and Xu <ref> [9] </ref>. Let us denote by I h 1 the usual nodal value interpolant on the grid a 1 0 ; a 1 2 ; ; a 1 m 1 +1 . The interpolator is well-defined in H 1 (fl 1 ).

Reference-contexts: Later, we use the density argument (Grisvard <ref> [19] </ref>) to estimate f h (w) a h (u fl ; w) for any u fl 2 H 1 (). We summarize the result in the following lemma. Lemma 2.

For 1=2 t 1 1, we use the trace theorem for C 0;1 (differentiable Lipschitz) curve (cf. Theorem 1.5.2.1 of Grisvard <ref> [19] </ref>), which gives ju (x)j Cd x kuk H 1=2+t 1 (-) Cd x kuk H 1+t 1 ( 1 ) : For 0 &lt; t 1 1=2, it is known that the continuous function space is embedded into H 1=2+t 1 ( 1 ).
