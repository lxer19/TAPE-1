Reference-contexts: On the other hand, Blum and Impagliazzo [BI87] showed that if P = NP, then P G = UP G . By Grollmann and Selman [GS88], we see that there can be no one-way functions relative to A. Our final comment is justified by Berman and Hartmanis's <ref> [BH77] </ref> theorem that if two sets are equivalent by one-one, length-increasing, invertible functions, then they must be isomorphic. 2 Finally, we know of two ways for the isomorphism conjecture to fail: the complete m-degree can fail to be a 1-degree, as relative a generic oracle; or the complete 1-li degree can

Reference-contexts: For all A; B !, if A 4 B is finite then for all i there exists a j such that L i (A) = L j (B). Most relativizable machine-based complexity classes studied fall under this definition. The following technical lemma extends a result of Blum and Impagliazzo <ref> [BI87] </ref>. Its proof is routine, and is omitted. Lemma 3.2 Let C be a complexity class by the definition above, G a generic set, and L an arbitrary arithmetic language. <p> Proof: Consider A = B G for PSPACE-complete B and generic G. The isomorphism conjecture fails relative to A, because G must be generic with respect to PSPACE [Kur88]. On the other hand, Blum and Impagliazzo <ref> [BI87] </ref> showed that if P = NP, then P G = UP G . By Grollmann and Selman [GS88], we see that there can be no one-way functions relative to A. <p> We have: Corollary 4.4 If L is arithmetical and G is sp-generic, then L 2 P G . 5 Collapsing Classes Generic oracles do not always separate classes: in some cases they collapse them. In this section we will extend the results of Blum and Impagliazzo <ref> [BI87] </ref>, Impagliazzo and Naor [IN88] and Fenner, Fortnow and Kurtz [FFK92] to show general collapses for sets into P. We will show that the following complexity classes equal P relative to sp-generic oracles: UP, FewP, SPP, BPP, WPP and NP " coNP. <p> Blum and Impagliazzo <ref> [BI87] </ref> show that F 2 FP NP for C A either UP A or NP A " coNP A . Impagliazzo and Naor [IN88] show that F 2 FP 2 for C A = BPP A .

Reference-contexts: all languages L such that for all polynomials r, there exist g 2 GapP and a polynomial q, such that x 2 L ) (1 2 r (n) )2 q (n) g (x) 2 q (n) 1 The notion of a gap class was introduced by Fenner, Fortnow, and Kurtz <ref> [FFK91] </ref>. 7 The following proposition is obtained by extending Toda's technique for show-ing that WPP is low for PP to give alternate characterizations of AWPP. Proposition 5.7 BPP; WPP AWPP.

Reference-contexts: A third notion, closely related to the second, is the symmetric perfect genericity used to prove the existence of an oracle relative to which the Berman-Hartmanis Isomorphism Conjecture holds <ref> [FFK92] </ref>. Definition 2.2 Let L PA [X] be the language of Peano Arithmetic, augmented by a unary predicate symbol X . We assume that the only logical operators in L PA [X ] are :, _, and 9; the other standard operators are defined in terms of these three. <p> "looks like" an annihilating function for enough lengths to make it a scrambling function), and therefore the complete 1-li degree of NP cannot be an isomorphism type relative to R G. 2 It is interesting to contrast these results with the fact that the isomorphism conjecture holds relative to sp-generics <ref> [FFK92] </ref>. 4 Symmetric Perfect Generic Sets The study of symmetric perfect genericity was initiated by Fenner, Fortnow, and Kurtz, who showed that the Isomorphism Conjecture holds relative to symmetric perfect generic sets. <p> In this section we will extend the results of Blum and Impagliazzo [BI87], Impagliazzo and Naor [IN88] and Fenner, Fortnow and Kurtz <ref> [FFK92] </ref> to show general collapses for sets into P. We will show that the following complexity classes equal P relative to sp-generic oracles: UP, FewP, SPP, BPP, WPP and NP " coNP. Under additional complexity assumptions we have these collapses for Cohen generics as well. <p> Lemma 5.4 If C A has polynomial certificate complexity then C G = P G for sp-generic G. The proof of Lemma 5.4 is similar to the proof that P = FewP relative to an sp-generic, which can be found in Fenner, Fortnow, and Kurtz <ref> [FFK92] </ref>. We can use Lemma 5.4 to show that many complexity classes collapse to P relative to sp-generics. We will start with an easy one: Theorem 5.5 For sp-generic G, NP G " coNP G = P G . Proof: Let N j denote the j-th nondeterministic oracle turing machine. <p> Blum and Impagliazzo [BI87] show that F 2 FP NP for C A either UP A or NP A " coNP A . Impagliazzo and Naor [IN88] show that F 2 FP 2 for C A = BPP A . Fenner, Fortnow and Kurtz <ref> [FFK92] </ref> show that F 2 FP NP for C A = FewP A . It is easy to see that F 2 FPSPACE for C A = AWPP A . Clearly if F 2 FP then Lemma 5.4 holds.

Reference-contexts: The rerelativization technique can be used to give several novel failures of this conjecture. The following theorem was proven by Hartmanis and Hemachandra <ref> [HH91] </ref> to refute a conjecture by Kurtz, Mahaney, and Royer that the Isomorphism Conjecture might be equivalent to the nonexistence of one-way functions.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the proof that the isomorphism conjecture fails relative to a generic oracle <ref> [Kur88] </ref> can be modified to show that any one-one function must be easily invertible at infinitely many lengths relative to a generic oracle. <p> Relative to this oracle, the complete 1-li degree of NP is an isomorphism type. Proof: Consider A = B G for PSPACE-complete B and generic G. The isomorphism conjecture fails relative to A, because G must be generic with respect to PSPACE <ref> [Kur88] </ref>. On the other hand, Blum and Impagliazzo [BI87] showed that if P = NP, then P G = UP G . By Grollmann and Selman [GS88], we see that there can be no one-way functions relative to A.

Reference-contexts: It is easily observed that L is a partial enumeration of NP"coNP with polynomial certificate complexity. 2 For the remaining collapses we will use a new gap class 1 AWPP described below and a powerful theorem from Nisan and Szegedy <ref> [NS92] </ref>.
