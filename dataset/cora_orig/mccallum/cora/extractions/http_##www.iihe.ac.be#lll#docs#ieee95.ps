Abstract: The deployment of optical fibers with the emergence of the ATM technology which relies on a Virtual Call (VC) model is the necessary infrastructure to support modern applications such as multimedia. In this paper, we propose to extend the classical method for packet switching, namely the distance vector and the link state method to cover these new user requirements. We present an ATM routeing architecture using route recording and source routeing which is based on "pre-computed" and "on-demand" routes.

Reference-contexts: The ATM Forum working group on Traffic Management has extended these classes by defining real time VBR, non real time VBR and Available Bit Rate (ABR) <ref> [AF-TM] </ref>. These service categories are defined by traffic parameters used to negotiate a traffic contract with the network. These parameters are such as Peak Cell Rate, Sustainable Cell Rate and Burst Tolerance [AF-TM]. <p> has extended these classes by defining real time VBR, non real time VBR and Available Bit Rate (ABR) <ref> [AF-TM] </ref>. These service categories are defined by traffic parameters used to negotiate a traffic contract with the network. These parameters are such as Peak Cell Rate, Sustainable Cell Rate and Burst Tolerance [AF-TM]. Furthermore, for some categories of services, the user is able to ask for specific constraints related to cell transfer which will be ensured by the network for cells complying with the traffic contract. These constraints are termed "QoS parameters" in the ATM jargon. <p> These constraints are termed "QoS parameters" in the ATM jargon. Examples of QoS are Cell Transfer Delay, Cell Delay Variation, Cell Error Ratio and Cell Loss Ratio <ref> [AF-TM] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: scheme as described in [NajSal2] provides with a more accurate resource allocation method. 4 Intra-RD routeing for ATM 4 . 1 Basic algorithms The SPF methods used for packet switching routeing can be classified into two main families: the Distance Vector (DV) algorithms based on a method developed by Bellman-Ford <ref> [BellFord] </ref> and the Link State (LS) based on a method originally proposed by Dijkstra [Dijk]. In the following sections, we will consider the DV and LS algorithms in the VC/QoS environment outlining problems that may arise in this new context and proposing solutions.

In the basic LS method, the routes to every destination ATM ES are computed in each ATM SW using the topological map (i.e. a Dijkstra algorithm is performed <ref> [Dijk] </ref> ). In some LS environment, ATM SWs are grouped into "clusters" to limit the resource required for route computation and maintenance (e.g. OSPF, IS-IS, [Nimrod]). 4.2 The loop problem Both DV and LS can suffer from loops.

Reference-contexts: As far as the DV is concerned, route recording is the only workable solution <ref> [FranSal] </ref>. 4 . 3 Pre-computed vs. on demand calculation In the basic DV and LS method, all the routes are continuously maintained by the network. If we consider the VC/QoS case, the pre-computation and storage of routes supporting each source/destination/QoS combinations would be too expensive.

In a VC environment, since the route computed at the setup phase will be used during the whole lifetime of the VC, the routeing protocol should provide "loop free" routes in any circumstances <ref> [NajSal1] </ref>. To avoid loops in a VC context, it has been discussed that for the LS it would be better to compute the route in a single ATM SW and to carried out this route in the VC setup packet. <p> With the LS method, an LS PDU can carry the QoS values characterising a given link. In this way, the complete topology map including QoS characteristics associated to each link and nodes can easily be maintained <ref> [NajSal1] </ref> [P-NNI]. For both cases, this leads to maintain a number of routes which is exponential. This is caused by the independence of QoS with each other. For the DV, this leads to exchange a exponential number of update messages. <p> DV and LS algorithms in the context of on-demand route computation and VC/QoS routeing. 4 . 5 . 1 DV on demand Our on demand DV scheme corresponds to implement an "Exploration" process discovering the routes linking the called and the calling ATM ESs supporting a specified set of QoS <ref> [NajSal1] </ref>. This Exploration process allows to distribute the route calculation among eligible ATM SWs. Let X be this number, the maximum complexity in terms of exchanged messages is O (g**X) (g is the maximum degree of the graph modeling the network) [NajSal1]. <p> calling ATM ESs supporting a specified set of QoS <ref> [NajSal1] </ref>.

We can quote that these on demand routeing schemes will require to exchange a number of messages which is either polynomial or exponential.

Reference-contexts: VC (i.e. resource reservation in ATM SW, ...) is realised either in the calling to the called direction or in the called to the calling direction.

Reference-contexts: With the LS method, an LS PDU can carry the QoS values characterising a given link. In this way, the complete topology map including QoS characteristics associated to each link and nodes can easily be maintained [NajSal1] <ref> [P-NNI] </ref>. For both cases, this leads to maintain a number of routes which is exponential. This is caused by the independence of QoS with each other. For the DV, this leads to exchange a exponential number of update messages. <p> These routes, called "on-demand routes", with special QoS requirements which are not covered by the pre-computed routes are calculated only upon user request. 4 . 4 P-NNI and pre-computed/on-demand routes computation The ATM Forum Working Group on Private NNI is currently developing a routeing architecture for the intra-RD case in <ref> [P-NNI] </ref>. This protocol is integrated in the NNI related traffic. The routeing architecture of [P-NNI] falls in the category of LS methods for the VC/QoS case. This architecture provides for both on-demand and pre-computed routes. <p> the pre-computed routes are calculated only upon user request. 4 . 4 P-NNI and pre-computed/on-demand routes computation The ATM Forum Working Group on Private NNI is currently developing a routeing architecture for the intra-RD case in <ref> [P-NNI] </ref>. This protocol is integrated in the NNI related traffic. The routeing architecture of [P-NNI] falls in the category of LS methods for the VC/QoS case. This architecture provides for both on-demand and pre-computed routes. Actually, the time when the routes are computed is implementation dependent (i.e. the routes can be computed in advance or upon the user request). <p> This is mainly caused by the loop problems that arise in the basic DV algorithms such as RIP. Although the ATM Forum is planning to adapt the existing LS protocols to the ATM environment <ref> [P-NNI] </ref>, our conclusion is that, at least for pre-computed routes, the LS algorithms are not anymore the only eligible architecture for ATM intra-RD routeing. 4 . 5 On demand route Nevertheless, we can not exclude that users might require an unpredictable combination of QoS parameter values. <p> This ATM SW collecting all these LS PDUs has to compute the requested route using this partial (but sufficient) topological view of the environment. The first method suffers from the same problem of information accuracy we mentioned in section4.5. This solution is selected by the ATM Forum P-NNI specification <ref> [P-NNI] </ref>. The second method is what we called "on demand LS algorithm". The complexity in terms of messages exchanged is O (X**2) 3 . <p> Moreover, in an high speed data network, the bandwidth and the processing power of nodes required for routeing is no longer a bottleneck. Finally, the information exchange related to the route calculation is generally classified as a part of the "signaling" information <ref> [P-NNI] </ref>. In case of "non associated signaling" this information will be transported in a specialised high speed network. 6 Conclusion Modern applications will require more flexibility and power which are to be provided by the network.

Reference-contexts: In addition, when an ATM SW sends an update about a given route, only the ATM SWs belonging to that route will receive this update. Moreover, it has been shown that the storage complexity of DV based method including route recording remains acceptable <ref> [Reckhter] </ref>. As a result, for the pre-computed calculation and maintenance processes used in a VC/QoS context, the DV method seems preferable rather than the LS method. This is in contradiction with the feeling commonly accepted stating that DV based routeing methods are outperformed by the LS techniques.
