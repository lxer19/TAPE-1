Abstract: We propose a deformable model for the analysis of deformable contours for a general class of problems. The model uses a novel active contour model (a snake model) on spatiotemporal surfaces. Although the proposed model can be used for a general class of nonrigid contour motion problems, whose only restrictions are some degree of smoothness and continuity, it also can take advantage of additional material or motion type information to increase the system performance. We also introduce an efficient implementation method for the minimization of this model. We developed a prototype system to test some of the ideas on a number of sequences of ultrasound tongue images. This prototype introduces some novel snake techniques, such as an internal energy based on smoothness and similarity to model contour, optical flow techniques to increase system robustness and efficiency, a new formulation for the minimization of a set of snakes, and a modification of dual-snakes to regularise the extracted contours. Experiments with this prototype produced encouraging results. This prototype was also a helpful tool for us to define our new model.

Reference-contexts: Finally, in poor images, the tongue surface can not be seen in a single frame, but only in motion. As a result, standard ways of detecting edges do not work for this problem, and hence specific processing methods should be developed. right.)

First, we will present this system to introduce some of the ideas we propose. We will discuss the limitations and problems of this system.

Reference-contexts: Using the discretized formulation (Equation (5)), making an exhaustive search for an optimal solution requires a computational complexity of O (m n ), where m is number of possible points for a snake element and n is the number of snake elements. Amini et. al. <ref> [3] </ref> proposed a dynamic programming technique for solving variational problems in computer vision, which includes the snake minimization process. Basically, the technique separates the minimization process into n independent stages, where n is the number of snake elements. <p> Williams and Shah [20] proposed another minimization technique based on greedy algorithm. Although this techniques reduces the computational complexity to O (mn), an optimal solution is not guaranteed due to the greedy nature of the algorithm. The algorithm is iterative similar to <ref> [3] </ref>. During each iteration, a neighborhood of each point is examined and the point in the neighborhood giving the smallest value for the energy term is chosen as the new location of the point. <p> Actually, this technique can be considered as a special case of dynamic programming method by Amini et. al. <ref> [3] </ref>. Instead of considering all the possible alternatives for a snake element, it considers only the points producing minimum local energy. In order to improve the efficiency of the implementation, other methods were proposed.

Reference-contexts: However, a missing prior shape information also means these techniques are sensitive to image noise and occlusion. These techniques are based on feature extraction and feature matching. Each system uses a different set of features based on the motion type. For example, Cohen et. al. <ref> [4] </ref> uses high curvature points as features and they are used as landmarks to guide the matching process. Kambhamettu and Goldgof [11], and Kambhamettu [13] use Gaussian curvatures for the feature mapping process of their system.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, restrictions of elastic motion class hold for our model. Note that focusing on 2D contours does not mean ignoring 3D case. In fact, most of the 3D surface analysis systems rely on analysis of 2D contours. For example, Cohen <ref> [5] </ref> extracts 2D contours from a stack of MRI images, and then uses these contours to build the 3D structure.

Reference-contexts: = n 1 i=2 2 The external energy term E ext (v i ; I) is given by the negative of the image gradient at v i E ext (v i ; I) = jrI (v i )j : In Equation (7), weighting parameter is set by using min-max principle <ref> [7] </ref>, which maximizes the equation with respect to and minimizes it over possible v i positions. The advantage of using min-max principle is that it will prevent the selection of a weighting parameter that represents E smo or E sim insufficiently in the minimized internal energy. <p> The advantage of using min-max principle is that it will prevent the selection of a weighting parameter that represents E smo or E sim insufficiently in the minimized internal energy.

Reference-contexts: Xu et. al.[21] introduces an internal energy which is not dependent on the shape of the contour. They achieve this by first removing the normal forces on the contour and then adding additional expansion or contraction. Gunn and Nixon <ref> [9] </ref> also address the robustness problem by using two contours to detect the desired contour. Similar to Xu et. al.[21], they remove the normal forces from the contour first. <p> Intuitively, the problem is that while minimizing the snake for tree level i, the method does not get any image or contour information from tree level i + 1 and lower tree levels. In order to overcome this limitation, we modified the dual-snake approach proposed by Gunn and Nixon <ref> [9] </ref>, which uses closed snakes unlike our open-ended snakes. In this method, one snake expands from the inside of the region of interest and one snake contracts from the outside.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, a classification of nonrigid motion based motion type restrictions would be very useful. Kambhamettu et al.[12] proposed a classification that is based on the classification of Goldgof et al.[8] and Huang <ref> [10] </ref>. Figure 1 shows the types of nonrigid motion as reviewed by Aggarwal et. al.[1] based on Kambhamettu's [12] work. Kambhamettu et. al.[12] defines these classes as follows: * Rigid motion preserves all distances and angles and has no associated nonrigidity. * Articulated motion is piecewise rigid motion.

The result of motion analysis without a shape model is only flow vectors at some points. Using interpolation and smoothing a dense flow field can be obtained.

Reference-contexts: This surface is deformed by the input data points and features. Other models include deformable superquadratics, deformable templates, and finite element method based models. Among all shape models, active contour models (snakes) <ref> [14] </ref> are the most popular. Snakes are energy minimizing splines that evolve under image features (external forces) but are constrained by smoothness, continuity and desired shape features (internal forces). <p> We will discuss the limitations and problems of this system. In the next section we will propose a deformable contour extraction and tracking model that can be applicable to a general class of nonrigid motion problems. Our system uses a deformable model based on active contour models <ref> [14] </ref> as the main tool for detecting the contour of the tongue surface. Considering the problems of ultrasound images produced by HATS, which is listed in Section 2, snakes are attractive. <p> Moreover, our system heavily relies on the information from the adjacent images. 4.1 Snake Formulation Our formulation of active contour models is based on time delayed discretized version of the original formulation <ref> [14] </ref> with some modifications. A snake is an ordered set of points V = [v 1 ; v 2 ; :::; v n ] with a snake energy value calculated using internal and external forces. <p> E smo (v i ) corresponds to the smoothness term in the original snake formulation <ref> [14] </ref>. It is estimated as (Figure 4), E smo (v i ) = 1 cos i = 1 v i1 v i : v i v i+1 jv i1 v i j jv i v i+1 j where i = 2 : : : (n 1). <p> If it is used as the only internal energy term, this smoothness term suffers from some of the problems with the original smoothness constraints <ref> [14] </ref>, e.g., tendency to shrink around strong edge points. However, this does not create a problem for our system because the internal energy of the snake uses this smoothness constraint in combination with the similarity constraint.

Reference-contexts: Instead of considering all the possible alternatives for a snake element, it considers only the points producing minimum local energy. In order to improve the efficiency of the implementation, other methods were proposed. Lai and Chin <ref> [15] </ref> propose a technique that examines only the neighboring points lying on normal lines to the contour instead of examining all the neighboring points. This reduces the number of possible points, m, for a snake point, thus improving the efficiency. <p> An example hard constraint is to force a minimum or maximum distance between snake elements. In contrast, soft constraints can be satisfied to a certain degree. The smoothness or continuity constraints are the examples. 7 Chin <ref> [15] </ref> propose to use Generalized Hough Transforms to place the initial contour. Choosing good weighting parameters is also a difficult problem for the user. Xu et. al.[21] introduced an active contour model that is robust against the selection of parameters. <p> However, this does not create a problem for our system because the internal energy of the snake uses this smoothness constraint in combination with the similarity constraint. The similarity term E sim (v i ; S) is very similar to the one proposed by Lai and Chin <ref> [15] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, our system needs only one contour model for the whole image sequence. It is the task of the system to extract and use information from the adjacent frames in the sequence. Laprie and Berger <ref> [16] </ref> also use snakes to extract tongue surfaces from X-ray images. Although similarities exist between our systems, there are fundamental differences in terms of image modal 8 ities and deformable contour models.

Reference-contexts: At VTV, Stone and Davis <ref> [18] </ref> developed a Head and Transducer Support System (HATS) for use in ultrasound imaging of tongue movement. Although X-ray images are relatively rapid and record the entire tongue, it is seldom used because of the radiation hazard.

Reference-contexts: Although HATS solved several difficulties in taking reliable and accurate ultrasound tongue images, there are problems that should still be addressed (Figure 3). Some of these problems were listed in Unser and Stone <ref> [19] </ref>. First, ultrasound images of the tongue are quite noisy. In addition, structures within the tongue (tendons, blood vessels) and noise echo artifacts cause 4 high contrast edges unrelated to the structure of interest. Another problem is that the ultrasound transducer of HATS emits a beam upward from the chin. <p> Although in the literature there are some systems extracting 2D tongue surface contours, to the best of our knowledge, our system is the first one to automatically extract surfaces for a complete ultrasound speech sequence. Unser and Stone <ref> [19] </ref> developed a system that takes a single ultrasound tongue image and extracts the tongue surface for that frame. For each image, the user has to supply some parameters to the system, e.g., the region of interest.

Reference-contexts: It is possible to define hard constraints 2 very easily by rejecting possible snake element positions that are violating the constraints. Another advantage of this method is the possibility of running the minimization on a parallel computer due to the fact that each stage is independent. Williams and Shah <ref> [20] </ref> proposed another minimization technique based on greedy algorithm. Although this techniques reduces the computational complexity to O (mn), an optimal solution is not guaranteed due to the greedy nature of the algorithm. The algorithm is iterative similar to [3].
