Title: The Silicon Compiler as a Tool for Teaching Microelectronic System Design  
Author: Richard B. Brown 
Address: Ann Arbor, MI 48109-2122  
Affiliation: Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Dept. University of Michigan,  
Abstract: 1 The advanced VLSI design course at the University of Michigan has been offered since 1985. Since 1987, a commercial silicon compiler has been used in class projects by the majority of students. This paper describes the course philosophy and content, and the impact of the silicon compiler on the students' design experience. By shielding students from much of the detail of physical design, the circuit compiler allows them to focus on higher-level issues. It enables students to design large integrated circuits, in which they encounter many challenges not seen in the tiny chips typically designed in introductory courses. These experiences become more valuable as technological advances focus efforts of integrated circuit designers on the efficient exploitation of large numbers of transistors in circuits of great complexity.

Reference-contexts: Students are required to buy a text book, but are allowed the flexibility of choosing one that would be most helpful to them. To fit their backgrounds, interests, and projects, students have chosen texts emphasizing digital <ref> [5] </ref> or analog [6] circuits, technology [7], architecture [8], and circuit compilers [9]. Since a student's greatest gains in competence and confidence come through actually doing mi 4 crosystem design, the course is oriented almost entirely toward the projects. Students can choose whether to work in small groups or individually.

Reference-contexts: A range of implementations of the dynamic time warp algorithm is discussed, covering general purpose microprocessors to custom chips and dedicated systolic arrays. The Intel 80386 videotape <ref> [10] </ref> introduces many of the real-world issues discussed throughout the remainder of the course. Alternative architectural and physical layout approaches for datapaths and controllers are presented. Throughout the course, it is emphasized that optimum architectural design is not intuitively obvious, but has to be identified through simulation.

Reference-contexts: For example, two chips have been designed in EECS627 as part of the HARTS (Hexagonal Architecture for Real-Time Systems) project, a testbed for research in distributed real-time computing, directed by Professor Kang G. Shin <ref> [11] </ref>. The nodes of HARTS are interconnected through fiber optics in a C-wrapped hexagonal mesh topology, so that each node has six neighbors. System performance and fault-tolerance are highly dependent upon the specific implementation of in-ternode communication.

Still, it is important to note the relationship between this research project and the compiler: the GaAs microprocessor owes its feasibility to the compiler, and much of the work on the project has been done as EECS627 class projects.
