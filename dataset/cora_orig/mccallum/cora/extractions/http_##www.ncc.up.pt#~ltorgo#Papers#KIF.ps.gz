Abstract: In this paper a methodology of knowledge integration is presented together with some experimental results. The goal of this method is the integration into a single theory of the knowledge obtained by different 'learning agents' . We state that this methodology can also be seen as a way to forget useless parts of theories. We briefly describe how this could be done in two different learning scenarios :- single-agent and multi-agent learning environments. Generally speaking, the typical task of a concept learning algorithm is as follows. Given a set of concepts and a set of examples which are said to represent these concepts, try to obtain a set of concept recognition rules (a theory). Each example given to the learning algorithm is previously classified as being an example of a specific concept. So the
