Reference-contexts: Then * There exists at least one solution to the agent's problem * Each solution verifies p x 0 i = p w i Proof 1 See <ref> [4] </ref> The solution x 0 i is not necessarily unique. Therefore, the relation x i (p) = x 0 i (p; w i ) is a correspondence, which we call acts-correspondence. This correspondence is homogeneous of degree 0 on P . Then the set of indexes can be normalized.

Reference-contexts: We use real coordinates to take into account the possibility of considering, instead of pure acts, lotteries over acts. The utility function is a real and continuous representation of preferences, and it is surjective but not injective because of its underlying partial ordering <ref> [13] </ref>. The initial allowance represents an allowed act, which the agent can exchange for another allowed act. We assume also that there is a space of indexes P = R l + dual to the space of acts and strictly positive, indicating that each act has a "value".

Reference-contexts: Moreover, a line of research can be initiated considering the structure of debates as one in which each argument can be associated to an autonomous agent. A justified sentence (one that can not be defeated by any other) can be seen as supported by an equilibrium (see <ref> [14] </ref> for the mathematics of this problem). In the next section we will introduce the main features of a society of autonomous agents in which agents have weak monotonic actions-correspondences.
