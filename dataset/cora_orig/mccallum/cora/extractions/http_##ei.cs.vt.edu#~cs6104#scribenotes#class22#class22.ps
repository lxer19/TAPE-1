Abstract: We began discussion on Lattice Basis Reduction. First, we reviewed select topics in lattices and linear algebra. Then we went on to discuss the 60 ffi Algorithm for reducing lattice bases in 2 dimensions. Finally, we calculated bounds for the length of a short vector in both the 2-dimensional and the generalized n-dimensional lattice reduction.

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, the quantities j ij j measure how close the original basis is to being orthogonal. In particular, each ij is 0 precisely when b i and b fl j are orthogonal. 5 Two-dimensional lattices The algorithm in this section comes from Kannan's paper <ref> [1] </ref>. We start with a basis fb 1 ; b 2 g for a lattice L. We want to get a basis fb 0 1 ; b 0 2 g for L in which b 0 1 is "short". <p> The boundary of a convex set forms a convex shape. 2. A closed set contains its perimeter and all interior points. 3. If a set A is symmetric about the origin, then for any v 2 A, v 2 A. Additionally, a set that contains the interval <ref> [1; 1] </ref>, along each of n dimensions, has volume 2 n . <p> If a set A is symmetric about the origin, then for any v 2 A, v 2 A. Additionally, a set that contains the interval [1; 1], along each of n dimensions, has volume 2 n . Theorem 6.2. (Kannan's Theorem <ref> [1] </ref>) If L is an n-dimensional lattice, then L contains a nonzero element v such that kvk n (d (L)) 1=n : This theorem provides us with a definition for "short" vectors in n dimensions. It employs Minkowski's theorem but does not provide an algorithm. Proof.

(Minkowski's Theorem | see Kannan's paper <ref> [2] </ref>) If S is a closed, convex, symmetric (about the origin) set in R n and has volume at least 2 n , then S contains at least one nonzero point of the integer lattice, Z n f0g. We define the following properties of S: 1.
