Abstract: Knowledge discovery in databases can be enhanced by augmenting them with "catalytic relations" conveying external common sense knowledge. Catalytic inference analysis the systematic analysis of inference closures in databases augmented with catalytic information uncovers new facts and rules, and latent inference channels. This paper presents a formalism for analyzing imprecise inference based on functional dependencies (FDs) in "mixed" databases containing precise, imprecise, and fuzzy information. The inference formalism is flexible and robust, and has major applications in database mining and database security control. The ability to deal with mixed databases is especially significant. Imprecise or fuzzy information may be introduced to catalyze inference in precise databases.

Reference-contexts: Some fuzzy relational database models introduce an additional "tuple membership" attribute [16,22]. Tuple membership is considered to be a Boolean property because the goal is to analyze database inference at the unit possibility level. The extension of tuple membership to values in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> or, more generally, fuzzy sets on [0; 1] is easily accomplished by treating tuple membership as a separate attribute. <p> Tuple membership is considered to be a Boolean property because the goal is to analyze database inference at the unit possibility level.

Reference-contexts: In addition to Armstrong's axioms, certain other inference axioms exist for fuzzy FDs <ref> [9] </ref>. The new axioms relate FDs at different precision levels. The following inference axiom states that if an information chunk x determines some chunk y using a fuzzy FD, then information more precise than x can determine information less precise than y. <p> The remaining inference axioms formalize partial deduction and abduction, the primary FD-based inference mechanisms. The axioms for partial deduction and abduction use "induced contexts" <ref> [9] </ref>, which are analogous to induced set functions in set theory. For a relation with attributes X and Y , the induced context, I X!Y (C X ), is the finest context for Y that yields a fuzzy FD from X to Y with context C X for X.

Reference-contexts: These features greatly increase the utility of the inference formalism in practical applications, including knowledge discovery and inference control. 2 Database Inference A functional dependency (FD) is a statement about the equality, redundancy, or equivalence of attribute values (see, e.g., <ref> [11] </ref>). It has a major role in database inference. The existence of a functional dependency, X ! Y , in a database relation implies that all tuples with matching X attribute values (components) also match in their Y components.

Reference-contexts: Two major obstacles have hindered practical applications of catalytic inference analysis. The first is to adequately model imprecise inference in databases [9,13]. The second is to deal with integration and interoperability issues in "mixed databases" containing various precise, imprecise (set-valued) and fuzzy database relations <ref> [17] </ref>. fl To whom correspondence should be addressed (email: sujeet@euler.mcs.utulsa.edu).

The canonical representation of imprecise inference generalizes precise deduction and the primitive imprecise inference mechanisms of abduction and partial deduction. Core integrity properties <ref> [17] </ref> are specified for "classicalizing" imprecise and fuzzy relations to maximize integration and interoperability with precise database relations.

Reference-contexts: A context C is a partition on a set ^ D generated by an equivalence relation (e.g., similarity relation <ref> [20] </ref>) on ^ D. ^ D is a subset of a database domain D. Equivalence classes in C are sets of indistinguishable elements because captures natural semantic equivalences between domain elements. R D is the set of all equivalence relations on subsets of D.
