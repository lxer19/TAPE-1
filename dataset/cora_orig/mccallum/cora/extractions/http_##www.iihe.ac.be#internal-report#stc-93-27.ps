Abstract: routing based on three protocols: ES-IS [ISO9542], IS IS [ISO10589] and IDRP [ISO10747]. With the emergence of multimedia applications, networks have to provide more and more bandwidth and should guarantee the quality of the communication between users. To address these issues, high speed architectures based on Virtual Circuit model such as ATM have been designed and successfully implemented. The current trends in telecommunication deployment indicate that very large Internets based on such model will be available in the near future. This paper addresses the routing problem in this context and analyzes the existing solutions. We conclude that the network has to provide pre-computed and on-demand routes using a variation of the Distance Vector algorithm. Among other things, source routing and complete route recording are used to prevent loop formation.

Reference-contexts: These algorithms have been extensively discussed in the literature (permanent and transitory loops at distance-vector-like algorithms and transitory loops at linkstate-like algorithms) [Cheng] [ZauGar]. However, usually the suggested solutions were related to SPF (Shortest-Path First) search which either prevents their adaptation to QoS based routing <ref> [Awerb] </ref> or this adaptation would imply a very poor performance [Garcia89]. In addition to loop avoidance, Source routing has a number of advantages: 2) As in our VC environment the quality of a route depends on a combination of different QoS requirements.

Reference-contexts: The interaction between ESs and the network (Switching nodes) is referred to as ES-IS routing. For the purpose of this paper, only the Intra RD case will be discussed. The Inter RD routing in a VC/QoS environment is addressed in <ref> [NajSal] </ref> 2.3. More about QoS In a distributed environment, each application has its own set of requirements concerning the "quality of the transmission". For instance, a file transfer might be characterized by the transfer of an high volume of information without any error.

Reference-contexts: A review of routing methods for QOS/VC routing 3.1. SPF Distance Vector and Link State The SPF methods used for packet switching routing can be classified in two main classes: the Distance Vector (DV) algorithm based on a method developed by Bellman-Ford <ref> [BellFord] </ref> and the LinkState (LS) based on a method originally proposed by Dijkstra [Dijk]. Examples of DV implementation are provided by RIP [RIP], DECNET Phase IV algorithms [SHW-86] and IDRP [ISO10747] (the OSI protocol used to route the ISO-IP traffic in the inter-domain case).

Reference-contexts: The value of P depends on the resources that the network is capable to allocate for route storage and calculation purposes. It has been shown in the literature that the basic DV solution suffers from "long term loops" which are inherent to the method used to establish routes <ref> [Cheng] </ref> and from "transient loops" during the convergence process of the algorithm due to the fact that inconsistent routing tables are present in systems. Solutions have been proposed to limit the long term loop problem (e.g. Split Horizon, Hold-count, complete route recording, ...). <p> These algorithms have been extensively discussed in the literature (permanent and transitory loops at distance-vector-like algorithms and transitory loops at linkstate-like algorithms) <ref> [Cheng] </ref> [ZauGar].

Pre-computed routes vs. on-demand routes In a datagram environment such as IP and CLNP, it is important to have pre-computed routes since each packet is to be routed and forwarded accordingly.
