Reference-contexts: We envisage a spiral process of knowledge acquisition of coming stepwise closer and closer to an operationalisation of the knowledge in question. Our approach follows the work by Compton et al. on knowledge acquisition which allows knowledge acquisition and maintenance without a knowledge engineer; see e.g. <ref> [1, 5] </ref>. We believe, that experts are usually able to explain their reasoning process on a particular problem instance in rather general terms that cover at least the given concrete next step in their search process. <p> The paper is organised as follows: In the next section 2, we present our knowledge acquisition approach of Nested Ripple Down Rules, substantial extension to Ripple Down Rules <ref> [1] </ref>. In section 3, we present the design of our knowledge acquisition workbench and initial experiments in the domain of chess. <p> The final section 4 presents a discussion of the achieved results and future directions of research. 2 Nested Ripple Down Rules In this section, we introduce Nested Ripple Down Rules, which represent a substantial extension to Ripple Down Rules, as introduced by Compton et al., see e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>. Nested Ripple-Down Rules (NRDRs) represent a powerful framework for the incremental development and maintenance of complex knowledge bases without a knowledge engineer. <p> In practice it turned out, that this approach allows an expert to easily specify conditions which characterise necessary exception rules fairly well and with minimal effort. Furthermore, possible mistakes in the specification of such rules are easily corrected later on. Compare also <ref> [1, 4, 2] </ref>. In this paper we introduce our NRDRs as follows: For explaining the classification of an object, we allow besides the choice of an attribute value range also the use of other user-defined concepts. In fact, those concepts are also incrementally defined as a Ripple Down Rule.

Reference-contexts: Opposed to that is our approach, which targets to skip the time-consuming process of analysing the expertise and the problem domain by a knowledge engineer, as it has been advocated, e.g. in <ref> [2] </ref>. It rather allows the experts themselves to communicate their expertise to the system. <p> In practice it turned out, that this approach allows an expert to easily specify conditions which characterise necessary exception rules fairly well and with minimal effort. Furthermore, possible mistakes in the specification of such rules are easily corrected later on. Compare also <ref> [1, 4, 2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Capturing the expertise being employed for such skilled search processes is a difficult task. Although there are plenty of applications of more relevance, let us consider the expert search processes in chess playing for illustration purposes. De Groot <ref> [3] </ref> conducted systematic psychological studies into the thought processes involved in master chess play. A master chess player, thinking aloud, may report the following: ... Let me try to attack the pawn on f2. Ok, I can move my bishop to c5 attacking this pawn.

Reference-contexts: Knowledge Acquisition is widely considered as a modelling activity [8]. What is modelled is the expertise of a domain expert. Such a model is attempted to be described at the Knowledge level <ref> [6] </ref>. Building such models is largely attempted by prior detailed conceptual analysis of the domain and the available knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Future work will address a deeper theoretical penetration of the structure and properties of nested Ripple-Down Rules. Initial theoretical studies of `plain' RDRs just began <ref> [7] </ref>, which is a yet a far away from the study of NRDRs.
