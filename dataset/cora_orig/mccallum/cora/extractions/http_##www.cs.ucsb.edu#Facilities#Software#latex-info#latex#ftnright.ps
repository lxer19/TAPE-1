Abstract: The new release is a basically unchanged version of the original. I upgraded the macros so that they work with L A T E X 2 " and used some of the additional flexibility introduced therein. For example, the command "preparefootins is now automatically called at "begin-document-, thus allowing the user to adjust the "textheight in the preamble. It is not surprisingly that I was forced to change some of the macros because they dig deep into L A T E X's output routines. Fortunately this is something normally not necessary when upgrading other L A T E X 2.09 styles to L A T E X 2 " packages. The placement of footnotes in a multi-column layout always bothered me. The approach taken by L A T E X (i.e., placing the footnotes separately under each column) might be all right if nearly no footnotes are present. But it looks clumsy when both columns contain footnotes, especially when they occupy different amounts of space. sult doesn't look very pleasant since short footnotes produce undesired gaps of white space. Of course, the main goal of this package was a balancing algorithm for columns which would allow switching between different numbers of columns on the same page. With this feature, the natural place for footnotes seems to be the bottom of the page 1 but looking at some of the results it seems best to avoid footnotes in such a layout entirely. Another possibility is to turn footnotes into end-notes, i.e., printing them at the end of every chapter or the end of the entire document. But I assume everyone who has ever read a book using such a layout will agree with me, that it is a pain to search back and forth, so that the reader is tempted to ignore the endnotes entirely. When I wrote the article about "Future extensions of T E X" [6] I was again dissatisfied with the outcome of the footnotes, and since this article should show certain aspects of high quality typesetting, I decided to give the footnote problem a try and modified the L A T E X output routine for this purpose. The layout I used was inspired by the yearbook of the Gutenberg Gesellschaft Mainz [2]. Later on, I found that it is also recommended by Jan White [9]. On the layout of footnotes I also consulted books by Jan Tschi-chold [8] and Manfred Simoneit [7], books, I would
