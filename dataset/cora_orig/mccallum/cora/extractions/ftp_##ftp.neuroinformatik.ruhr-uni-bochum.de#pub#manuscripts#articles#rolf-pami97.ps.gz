Abstract: Recognition systems based on model matching using low level features often fail due to a variation in background. As a solution I present a system for the recognition of human faces independent of hairstyle. Correspondence maps between an image and a model are established by coarse-fine matching in a Gabor pyramid. These are used for hierarchical recognition.

Reference-contexts: With s the standard deviation of the series S i without S 0 the cri teria for the acceptance of a match is: 1 = S 1 S 0 &gt; t 1 ; 2 = [S 0 &gt; t 2 ] : (15) Like in <ref> [2] </ref>, both criteria are be combined with a logical OR in order to keep more significant recognitions while ruling out all incorrect ones.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, hierarchical recognition was always superior to the one from the highest level alone. This gives interesting insights into the distribution of prominent recognition cues across the spatial frequency range. More details can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. As a general observation over many examples the correspondence maps obtained by this method are very reliable. This is of importance not only for good recognition results but also for the tracking of facial points [7] and possibly for measuring emotion.

Reference-contexts: A third image database I3 has been used which consisted of the negatives of I1 in the sense that the grey value I (~x) of each pixel was replaced by 255 I (~x). Such images of human faces are hard to recognize <ref> [6] </ref>, which proves that human face recognition must make some use of the Gabor phases. The recognition system failed to recognize the face from a negative image in all cases for both segmentation schemes, because the assumption that phase differences are caused by local displacements becomes completely wrong.

This is of importance not only for good recognition results but also for the tracking of facial points <ref> [7] </ref> and possibly for measuring emotion. As there is no objective method of finding the true correspondences, this claim has been checked on a variety of model/image pairs but not been proved quantitatively. Examples for correspondence maps are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. VI.

Reference-contexts: In the hierarchical system, all refinement steps are completely independent of each other, which makes the parallel complexity proportional to the number of frequency levels involved. I close the discussion by comparing this system to the ones in <ref> [8] </ref>, which describes the state of the art in face recognition in 1995. The proposed system performs better than all of those in at least one of the following respects: 1. No manual point correspondences or pose normaliza 8 tion have been used. 2.
