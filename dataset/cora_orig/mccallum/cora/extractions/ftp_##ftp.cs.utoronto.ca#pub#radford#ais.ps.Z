Abstract: Technical Report No. 9805, Department of Statistics, University of Toronto Abstract. Simulated annealing | moving from a tractable distribution to a distribution of interest via a sequence of intermediate distributions | has traditionally been used as an inexact method of handling isolated modes in Markov chain samplers. Here, it is shown how one can use the Markov chain transitions for such an annealing sequence to define an importance sampler. The Markov chain aspect allows this method to perform acceptably even for high-dimensional problems, where finding good importance sampling distributions would otherwise be very difficult, while the use of importance weights ensures that the estimates found converge to the correct values as the number of annealing runs increases. This annealed importance sampling procedure resembles the second half of the previously-studied tempered transitions, and can be seen as a generalization of a recently-proposed variant of sequential importance sampling. It is also related to thermodynamic integration methods for estimating ratios of normalizing constants. Annealed importance sampling is most attractive when isolated modes are present, or when estimates of normalizing constants are required, but it may also be more generally useful, since its independent sampling allows one to bypass some of the problems of assessing convergence and autocorrelation in Markov chain samplers.

Reference-contexts: Ratios of normalizing constants can also be obtained when using annealed importance sampling itself, which from this perspective can be seen as a form of thermodynamic integration <ref> (see Gelman and Meng 1998) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This method is inspired by the idea of "annealing" as a way of coping with isolated modes, but it may be attractive 1 even when multimodality is not a problem. Importance sampling works as follows <ref> (see, for example, Geweke 1989) </ref>. Suppose that we are interested in a distribution for some quantity, x, with probabilities or probability densities that are proportional to the function f (x).

Reference-contexts: However, this decision affects only the variance of the estimates | the results are asymptotically correct regardless of how close the final state is to equilibrium. Regenerative methods <ref> (Mykland, Tierney, and Yu 1995) </ref> also eliminate the problems of dealing with sequential dependence (and also replace them with possible problems due to heavy-tailed distributions). To use regenerative methods, an appropriate "splitting" scheme must be devised for the Markov chain sampler.

Reference-contexts: Demonstrations on simple distributions in Section 5 confirm this. Annealed importance sampling is related to tempered transitions <ref> (Neal 1996) </ref>, which are another way of modifying the annealing procedure so as to produce correct results. As discussed in Section 6, annealed importance sampling will sometimes be preferable to using tempered transitions. <p> Over a range of fi values for which p j is close to Gaussian, and p 0 (x) is approximately constant in regions of high density under p j , an argument similar to that used for tempered transitions <ref> (Neal 1996, Section 4.2) </ref> shows that the best scheme uses a uniform spacing for log (fi j ) (ie, a geometric spacing of the fi j themselves). <p> The method of tempered transitions <ref> (Neal 1996) </ref> is closely related to the annealed importance method of this paper. <p> Handling isolated modes was the original motivation for annealing, and has been the primary motivation for developing methods related to annealing that produce asymptotically correct results. Annealed importance sampling is another such method, whose characteristics are similar to those of tempered transitions. As I have discussed <ref> (Neal 1996) </ref>, which of these methods is best may depend on whether the sequence of annealing distributions is "deceptive" in certain ways. <p> It is therefore not surprising that the methods of simulated tempering (Marinari and Parisi 1992; Geyer and Thompson 1995) and Metropolis 19 coupled Markov chains (Geyer 1991) easily yield estimates for ratios of normalizing con-stants as a byproduct. Tempered transitions were previously seen as being deficient in this respect <ref> (Neal 1996) </ref>, but we now see that such estimates can in fact be obtained by using annealed importance sampling estimators in conjunction with tempered transitions.

Reference-contexts: runs increases. (Note that in this procedure one averages the estimates from multiple runs for the ratio of normalizing constants, not for the log of this ratio, as might seem more natural from the point of view of statistical physics.) Unlike simulated tempering and the related method of umbrella sampling <ref> (Torrie and Valleau 1977) </ref>, no preliminary estimates for ratios of normalizing constants are required when using annealed importance sampling. Metropolis coupled Markov chains share this advantage, but have the disadvantage that they require storage for states from all the intermediate distributions.
