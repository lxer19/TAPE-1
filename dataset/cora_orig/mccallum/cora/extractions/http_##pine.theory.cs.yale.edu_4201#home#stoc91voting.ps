Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating a Boolean function f : f0; 1g n ! f0; 1g by the sign of an integer polynomial p of degree k. For us, a polynomial p(x) predicts the value of f(x) if, whenever p(x) 0, f(x) = 1, and whenever p(x) &lt; 0, f(x) = 0. A low-degree polynomial p is a good approximator for f if it predicts f at almost all points. Given a positive integer k, and a Boolean function f, we ask, "how good is the best degree k approximation to f?" We introduce a new lower bound technique which applies to any Boolean function. We show that the lower bound technique yields tight bounds in the case f is parity. Minsky and Papert [10] proved that a perceptron can not compute parity; our bounds indicate exactly how well

Reference-contexts: PP A 6= PSPACE A for random A Bennet and Gill [3] assert that PP A 6= PSPACE A with probability 1 relative to a random oracle A. Unfortunately, their proof has a bug <ref> [1] </ref> and the question of separating the two classes relative to a random oracle has remained open. Fortunately, the lower bound of Theorem 2.2 gives us a way to show that the two classes are in fact distinct.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Linial, Mansour, and Nisan [9]; Tarui [16]; and Beigel, Reingold, and Spielman <ref> [2] </ref> have shown that polynomial-size, bounded-depth circuits can be closely approximated as the sign of a low-degree polynomial over the rationals. <p> Relation to Bounded-Depth Circuits In this section we describe a method for constructing from an AC 0 circuit with a majority gate at its root a voting polynomial which closely approximates it. The construction is based on that of Beigel, Reingold, and Spielman <ref> [2] </ref>. The following key lemma is a simplification of their Lemma 5. Note that in this construction bits will be represented by the real values 0 and 1.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we describe a result which relates the degree of a polynomial over the rationals to its ability to accurately approximate particular Boolean functions. Our bounds are tight in the case of the parity function. In the language of perceptrons <ref> [10] </ref>, this shows the maximum number of inputs on which a perceptron of order k can output parity. <p> For this reason we refer to the latter representation as a voting polynomial. Voting polynomials are a special kind of perceptron <ref> [10] </ref>, a circuit which computes a weighted threshold of a set of arbitrary predicates. The order of a perceptron is the maximum number of input bits available to any one predicate.
