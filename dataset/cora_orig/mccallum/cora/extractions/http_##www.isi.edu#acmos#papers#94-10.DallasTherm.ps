Reference-contexts: 1: Introduction The field of reversible and adiabatic computing now ranges from the seminal theoretical work [4,7] to small working devices and circuits <ref> [2] </ref>. However, the theoretical work is typically couched in terms of idealized apparatus such as Turing machines, which bear little resemblance to modern digital computers.

Reference-contexts: A rudimentary form of TL can be recognized as far back as Szilards seminal 1929 thought experiment that tied information theory to thermodynamics <ref> [3] </ref>. However, since he was concerned with information storage rather than computing, his devices were limited to memory cells. It is worth noting that the analogy between electronic and thermal systems can be extended to other types of systems as well.

Reference-contexts: One usually introduces one or more clock signals to signal the latches to load the new result. However, latches are inherently dissipative, since they generate entropy when they are reloaded and their previous contents are erased <ref> [7] </ref>. The adiabatic case must therefore necessarily be different. On the plus side, in the adiabatic case the potential sources themselves can be periodic, so a pipeline clocking scheme can use the power supplies for timing. <p> Thus the result is trapped at the end of the pipeline, where it is available for reading. Note, however, that no non-adiabatic energy dissipation actually occurs until the next pulse reaches the end and overwrites the trapped result, which is just what Landauers work would predict <ref> [7] </ref>. 3. By building a loop of pipeline stages, one forms a finite state machine, that can be used to generate control signals for datapaths. A pulse of energy travels round and round the loop, sequentially passing through the states of the machine.
