Abstract: In signal processing, four functions of one variable are commonly used. They are: the (time) signal, the spectrum, the auto-correlation function of the signal, and the autocorrelation function of the spectrum. The variables of these functions are denoted, respectively, as: time, frequency, lag, and doppler. In time-frequency analysis, these functions of one variable are extended to quadratic functions of two variables. In this paper, we investigate a method for creating quartic functions of three of these variables and also a quartic function of all four variables. These quartic functions provide a meaningful representation of the signal that goes beyond the well known quadratic functions. The quartic functions are applied to the design of signal-adaptive kernels for Cohen's class and shown to provide improvements over previous methods.

Reference-contexts: For these reasons, the first four terms of the Q function will be called auto terms analogous to the auto terms of the Wigner distribution. The last six terms in equation 12 have properties that are very similar to the properties of cross terms in the Wigner distribution <ref> [1] </ref>. Each of the last the last six terms is centered directly between two of the first four terms. In addition, each of the last six terms is oscillatory, and the direction of the oscillation is perpendicular to the line connecting the two auto terms.

Reference-contexts: In the same way, one can apply kernels to the quartic functions to create an infinite number of distributions of three and four variables. Jones and Baraniuk have developed a method for creating a function of time, lag, and doppler that they call a short-time ambiguity function (STAF) <ref> [3] </ref>. They developed this function for the purpose of creating signal-adaptive kernels that vary over time. <p> But since the signal is nonstationary, it is reasonable to assume that a kernel that works well at one time, will not necessarily work well at another time. Jones and Baraniuk recognized this and extended their RGK algorithm to design signal-adaptive, time-varying kernels <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> This kernel is fixed (does not vary over time nor frequency) and is not signal adaptive. Method 2: The second method uses the ambiguigram to compute a signal-adaptive kernel that varies over time <ref> [3] </ref>. Method 3: The third method, as described above, uses the Q function to create a signal-adaptive kernel that varies over time and frequency. All three methods have a window length parameter that provides a tradeoff between maintaining resolution of the auto terms and suppressing the cross terms.

Reference-contexts: Since the structure of the cross terms and auto terms in the Wigner distribution varies greatly for different signals, kernels that work well for one signal will not necessarily work well for other signals. Because of this, Baraniuk and Jones <ref> [4, 5] </ref> have proposed methods for creating signal adaptive kernels. Their algorithms use the ambiguity function as a means for finding "good" signal-adaptive kernels. <p> It has been observed that, in the ambiguity function, the auto terms lie near the origin while the cross terms tend to lie away from the origin [6] and the methods of Baraniuk and Jones exploit this observation. The signal dependent kernel introduced in <ref> [4] </ref> is called a radially Gaussian kernel (RGK) and is formulated in the ambiguity plane as: (; t ) = exp 2 + t 2 where the spread function, (-), controls the "spread" of the kernel at angle -.

Method 2: The second method uses the ambiguigram to compute a signal-adaptive kernel that varies over time [3].
