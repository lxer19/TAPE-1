Abstract: Let and be two probability measures on the real line and c be a lower semicontinuous function on the plane. The mass transfer problem consists in determining a measure with respective marginals and that minimizes the functional c d. In this paper we show that, whenever the measure c is strictly superadditive, the solution corresponding to the lower Frechet bound is the unique optimal solution. This result also holds for the discrete version of the problem. Resume. Soient et deux mesures de probabilite sur la droite reelle, et soit c une fonction semicontinue inferieurement definie sur le plan. Le probleme du transfert des masses consiste a determiner une mesure de marges et qui minimise la fonctionnelle c d. Dans cet article nous montrons que, si la mesure c est strictement superadditive, alors la solution correspondant a la borne inferieure de Frechet est l'unique solution optimale de notre probleme. En fait, ce resultat est aussi valable pour le probleme de Hitchcock, c'est-a-dire la version discrete du probleme considere.

Reference-contexts: The work of Monge has been pursued by several mathematicians, among which Appell <ref> [1, 2] </ref> and Kantorovitch [6], who formulated it as a mathematical program in a functional space. This latter approach has been adopted in the modern literature. To be specific, let us consider two topological spaces X and Y endowed with respective regular measures and , with (X) = (Y ).
