Abstract: Interruptions and cancellations are important parts of a user interface, yet they are treated as special cases in user interface design and notations. In an effort to build a dialogue notation that allows for effective definition of these commands or user turns, we present a behavioral definition of interruptions and cancellations. We show several examples of how our definition accounts for different forms of behavior. The behavioral definitions provided here are a step towards providing better support for the definition and implementation of these turns.

Reference-contexts: If interruptions and cancellations are allowed, the system response must be consistent with how humans deal with interruptions and cancellation in human conversations. These are rarely accepted without some form of negotiation between the participants. This negotiation helps the participants ground the conversation <ref> [1] </ref> and allows them to consider the possible implications. Not all interruptions and cancellations need to be negotiated. Some may be accepted without any negotiation because the possible damage done is minimal.

Reference-contexts: Also, the representation of these commands in dialogue notations is usually done as an afterthought. As a result, a complete definition of the abort semantics would make a complete mess of the hierarchical structure of the dialogue description <ref> [2] </ref> page 263. The notations are usually extended with global states, or special transitions to handle cancel requests. In addition, they provide no guidance or suggestions on what would be the appropriate way to implement these user turns. In this paper we present a behavioral definition of interruptions and cancellations.

Reference-contexts: Not all interruptions and cancellations need to be negotiated. Some may be accepted without any negotiation because the possible damage done is minimal. Cancellation requests, also referred to as the abort command, are difficult to define using dialogue notations and difficult to implement <ref> [3] </ref>. One reason for this is the poor understanding of what should happen, from a behavioral point of view, when users request cancellations. Also, the representation of these commands in dialogue notations is usually done as an afterthought.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we present a behavioral definition of interruptions and cancellations. This definition is based on a behavioral description of how humans negotiate interruptions and cancellations. A dialogue model <ref> [4] </ref> is being developed that considers the behavioral as well as the constructional issues related with the definition and implementation of interrup tions and cancellations. BEHAVIORAL DEFINITIONS Cancellation Requests A cancellation occurs when the user decides not to continue the current exchange and terminates the dialogue.
