Abstract: This paper describes current work on a cooperative tele-assistance system for semi-autonomous control of mobile robots. This system combines a robot architecture for limited autonomous perceptual and motor control with a knowledge-based operator assistant which provides strategic selection and enhancement of relevant data. It extends recent developments in artificial intelligence in modeling the role of visual interactions in problem solving for application to an interface permitting the human and remote to cooperate in cognitively demanding tasks such as recovering from execution failures, mission planning, and learning. The design of the system is presented, together with a number of exception-handling scenarios that were constructed as a result of experiments with actual sensor data collected from two mobile robots.

Reference-contexts: In systems such as [19], the remote operates autonomously for tasks in which its performance is known to be better and under direct supervision if the remote fails. However, traded control can go the other way as seen in the KRITIC architecture <ref> [2] </ref>, where the remote may override an instruction from the operator (turn left) if deemed necessary (there is an obstacle on the left). Traded control schemes are particularly advantageous for operating robots in unknown environments.

Reference-contexts: The interaction between human and robot is managed in a variety of ways collectively referred to as telesystems. Telesystems have long been recognized as a key technology for space exploration <ref> [3, 12, 13, 14, 24, 25, 29] </ref>, and they are becoming increasingly integral to a variety of terrestrial applications including the decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear processing plants [30], rescue, fire-fighting, intervention operations in hazardous environments [9, 10, 18, 28], and security [8]. Unfortunately telesystems, in general, have three drawbacks.

Reference-contexts: It was designed to support intervention and recovery in the case of execution failures (e.g., sensor malfunctions, faulty plans). Intervention and recovery typically requires problem solving abilities which, along with mission planning, have been resistant to automation <ref> [4] </ref>. In teleSFX the problem solving activity of identifying the cause of the execution failure and determining the appropriate response may be shared by the remote and the human. The remote attempts to first classify and recover from an execution failure using local knowledge.

Reference-contexts: As a result, it gives quicker task completion by avoiding commmunication time delays and eliminates the need for continuous attention [26]. Supervisory control may be the most likely control scheme to allow an operator to handle more than one remote robot at a time. However, as noted in <ref> [5] </ref>, a major limitation with either supervisory or fully autonomous control is the development of self-monitoring routines for the robot so that it can alert the operator that an anomalous situation has arisen. <p> In [15], the teleSFX control scheme was introduced, emphasizing the intelligent exception handling mechanism at the remote. Unlike configuration, exception handling must be done in real-time (for example, a robot may be moving when a sensor malfunctions). As shown in <ref> [5] </ref>, autonomous exception handling is difficult because it involves domain and hardware specific information which may not always be available or correct. TeleSFX uses a three part strategy for exception handling: detection, classification, and recovery. The first step, detection, determines that a "sensing failure" has occurred. <p> In the classification step, the remote robot attempts to autonomously identify a sensing failure, and adapt the sensing configuration. This involves hypothesis generation, testing and response heuristics at the remote site, and several experiments have been described in 9 <ref> [5] </ref> which demonstrate this capability. However, the success of the classification step depends on the expert understanding of the domain and the sensors. This domain-dependence means that classification by the robot is brittle and will not always be successful.

Further difficulties include the introduction of new types of operator fatigue and cognitive overload due to increased environmental complexity or data displayed from non-intuitive sensing modalities such as SAR.

Reference-contexts: An alternative approach to compartmentalizing intelligence at either the local or the remote is to distribute levels of intelligence between them. The teleSFX architecture <ref> [15] </ref> is one example of a distribution of intelligence for telesystems. It was designed to support intervention and recovery in the case of execution failures (e.g., sensor malfunctions, faulty plans). Intervention and recovery typically requires problem solving abilities which, along with mission planning, have been resistant to automation [4]. <p> The emphasis in this paper is on the interactive exception handling aspects of this design. TeleSFX The remote agent is implemented following the teleSFX architecture. In <ref> [15] </ref>, the teleSFX control scheme was introduced, emphasizing the intelligent exception handling mechanism at the remote. Unlike configuration, exception handling must be done in real-time (for example, a robot may be moving when a sensor malfunctions).

If an execution failure is detected, fusion is suspended and control is passed to an exception-handling mechanism.

This approach has been used to assist radiologists in medical diagnosis, by selectively focusing attention on relevant aspects of the image, automatically enhancing the image according to the current needs of the problem solving activity, and interactively assisting the decision-making process by managing hyptheses [22]. <p> TeleVIA Blackboard The blackboard is the heart of the cooperative intelligent assistant. It is where the evolutionary results of the problem solving effort are captured. The logical partitioning of the blackboard is based on components of a cognitive model of visual interaction described in <ref> [21] </ref>, and illustrated in Figure 5. 10 ********************************* ******************************** This organization was designed to facilitate transfer of information between human perception and problem solving during a visual reasoning task. In the domain of tele-assistance, it is seen that, with one exception, the same logical partitions or panels may be used. <p> In this manner, the superior perceptual capabilities of the human can be exploited in order to diagnose the problem more quickly. TeleVIA Control The four control modules of teleVIA are also based on aspects of the cognitive model of visual interaction referenced previously in <ref> [21] </ref>. The Hypothesis Manager is primarily concerned 12 with the problem solving aspect of the task, while the Attention Director deals with the perceptual side. The Strategy Selector allows the program to decided which of these aspects to consider next, and also which approach to take.

Reference-contexts: Supervisory control relies on the operator to initiate and terminate the action and to respond to emergency situations. As a result, it gives quicker task completion by avoiding commmunication time delays and eliminates the need for continuous attention <ref> [26] </ref>. Supervisory control may be the most likely control scheme to allow an operator to handle more than one remote robot at a time.

Reference-contexts: First, most systems require a prohibitively high communication bandwidth in order for the human to perceive the environment and make corrections in the remote's action quickly enough [11]. Even with adequate communication bandwidth, the operator may experience cognitive fatigue due to the repetitive nature of many tasks, poor displays <ref> [27] </ref>, and the demands of too much data and too many simultaneous activities to monitor [7]. Furthermore, telesystems are inefficient in that the operator generally handles only one robot and that interaction leads to reduction of work efficiency by factors of five to eight [20].

Reference-contexts: Telesystems have long been recognized as a key technology for space exploration [3, 12, 13, 14, 24, 25, 29], and they are becoming increasingly integral to a variety of terrestrial applications including the decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear processing plants [30], rescue, fire-fighting, intervention operations in hazardous environments <ref> [9, 10, 18, 28] </ref>, and security [8].
