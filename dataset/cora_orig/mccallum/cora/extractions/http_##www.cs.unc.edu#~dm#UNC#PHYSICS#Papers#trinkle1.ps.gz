Abstract: This paper is summary of a comprehensive study of the problem of predicting the possible acceleration(s) of a set of rigid, three-dimensional bodies in contact in the presence of Coulomb friction. We begin with a brief introduction to this problem and a survey of related work and previous approaches. This is followed by the introduction of two novel complementarity formulations for the contact problem under two friction laws: Coulomb's Law and an analogous law in which Coulomb's quadratic friction cone is approximated by a pyramid. Under a full column rank assumption on the system Jacobian matrix, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a solution to our new models in the case where the friction coefficients are nonnegative and sufficiently small. For the model based on the friction pyramid law, we also show that the classical Lemke almost-complementary pivot algorithm and our new feasible interior point method are guaranteed to compute a solution. Extensive computational results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and characteristics of these solution methods for solving the model with friction pyramids. Finally, results are summarized and conclusions are drawn. y The research of this author was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant IRI-9304734, the Texas Advanced Research Program under grant 999903-078, and the Texas Advanced Technology Program under grant 999903-095.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, when the normal component of the contact force is positive, the normal component of the relative acceleration must be zero. A common approach to solving the multi-rigid-body contact problem has been formalized and implemented in the DADS software package by Haug <ref> [10] </ref>. In this approach, one formulates the equations of motion as a system of differential algebraic equations (DAE's).

Reference-contexts: In particular, when the rod leans opposite its sliding direction and the contact force is restricted to have finite magnitude (as suggested by Kilmister and Reeve <ref> [11] </ref>), it can happen that the only possible solution is one in which the rod would penetrate the surface on which it is sliding; thus the inconsistency. Mason and Wang showed that by allowing the force to be impulsive (i.e., of infinite magnitude), the problem could be solved.

Mathematically, it corresponds to the case where S = ;. Using the theory of quadratic programming, Lotstedt showed that the all-rolling problem in the plane has a solution <ref> [14] </ref> if the following Jacobian matrix has full column rank: 2 W n W t n J T 3 Baraff later showed in [1], that all planar problems with only one contact have a solution (regardless of the rank of this matrix), and he suggested that his proof extends trivially to <p> Note that in the special case of assembly stability testing, the body velocities (i.e., _ q and _ ) are zero, so the problem will always have a solution. The sliding-rolling problem Lotstedt <ref> [14] </ref> showed that the planar problem with both rolling and sliding contacts has a unique solution if every matrix in a family of matrices (closely related to ~ A defined in equation (27)) belongs to the class of P-matrices; see Appendix A for definition. <p> The detailed proof of Theorem 1 is given in Appendix A. The existence proof uses an argument that is similar to the all-rolling case [21]; the uniqueness proof is based on an extension of the argument for the planar case that Lotstedt used in <ref> [14] </ref>. In general, solutions to the two contact models could be quite distinct. The next result gives a simple condition for a solution of the friction pyramid model to be a solution of the cone model.

Reference-contexts: The DAE method would formulate the equations of motion under the assumption that the tip of the rod continues to roll, and integration would continue. The problem with this is that Lotstedt determined initial conditions under which the rod's ensuing motion cannot be determined uniquely <ref> [15] </ref>. Indeed, the rod's tip could begin to slide or separate, or it could continue to roll. Thus, unbeknownst to the DAE user, one of three possible evolutions of the rod has been determined. <p> To make matters worse, it is possible that the model admits several distinctly different solutions for one set of initial conditions and input. As mentioned earlier, Lotstedt constructed an example in which the model admitted three solutions <ref> [15] </ref>. Despite this difficulty, multi-rigid-body models have recently received great interest in the virtual reality (VR), graphics, and robotics research communities. The VR community is motivated by the desire to enhance the believability of the scenes in which the VR user is submersed. <p> known results of Lotstedt [14] and Baraff [1]. 4.1 Problems without friction In previous work it was established that the frictionless three-dimensional, multi-rigid-body contact problem has a unique solution for the accelerations of the bodies, q and , but that contact force magnitudes, c n , are generally not unique <ref> [15] </ref>. For example, consider a frictionless right rectangular block oriented so that one of its pairs of parallel faces is perpendicular to the direction of gravitational acceleration. Assume that the other four faces are each contacted near their four corners by fixed active bodies.

Reference-contexts: However, it can also produce quite unexpected results. For example, consider a rigid object sliding at one point on another. It has been known for at least 100 years that if Coulomb friction exists at the contact, then the rigid-body model will not always possess a solution <ref> [18] </ref>. To make matters worse, it is possible that the model admits several distinctly different solutions for one set of initial conditions and input.

Reference-contexts: Currently, systems cannot handle situations involving the loss of contact and multiple contacts between objects.

A thorough understanding of the multi-rigid-body contact problem could lead to efficient solution algorithms that could be embedded in VR systems, alleviating this problem and related ones.

Reference-contexts: There remains much more to be accomplished. Trying to improve the theoretical results is clearly something worth looking into. The search for alternative algorithms for solving the friction pyramid model would be equally useful. In this regard, the NE/SQP method described in <ref> [20] </ref> offers a possibility; indeed, this method would also be a candidate for solving the cone model. This method and other approaches for dealing with the latter model are presently under investigation. Finally, there is practical side to this study.

Reference-contexts: However, their development has been significantly hampered by a lack of understanding of rigid body contact mechanics. In an effort to improve our understanding, we recently formulated the three-dimensional, multi-rigid-body contact problem with Coulomb friction as a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) <ref> [6, 21] </ref>. This formulation allowed us to apply existing complementarity theory and the theory of quasi-variational inequalities to prove existence results that extended and subsumed all previous results known to us. <p> The specific objectives of this paper are to introduce to the engineering community a set of mathematical tools for the study, analysis, and numerical solution of the three-dimensional, multi-rigid-body contact problem with Coulomb friction. We will motivate and develop the models, extend the theoretical results established in <ref> [21] </ref> and discuss their practical significance, present applicable numerical methods, and discuss our computational experience with these methods. 1.2 Related work A derivation of the equations of motion and the relevant contact constraints for planar multi-rigid-body systems under Coulomb's friction law was given by Lotstedt in [14]. <p> However, it is worth noting that Jacobian matrix (40) and its three-dimensional counterpart, always have full column rank when there is only one contact. In <ref> [21] </ref>, we used the theory of quasi-variational inequalities to prove that a solution to the three-dimensional all-rolling problem must exist for both the cone and pyramid friction models under a mild assumption. This result includes Lotstedt's and Baraff's results as special cases. <p> Further, let N be the null space of the system Jacobian matrix (defined in equation (25)). Let F R F " N .

The existence proof uses an argument that is similar to the all-rolling case <ref> [21] </ref>; the uniqueness proof is based on an extension of the argument for the planar case that Lotstedt used in [14].

Reference-contexts: There are two interesting variations that change the form of the basic model. The first is the quasistatic, multi-rigid-body contact problem which is formed by setting the terms M obj q and M man to zero.

Reference-contexts: For the sliding rod problem, Erdmann's conditions are equivalent to Lotstedt's and ours. Finally, we note that with the difficulties discussed above, one may wonder whether it would be beneficial to include a model of contact compliance. Abel, Kumar and Wang <ref> [29] </ref> showed that multi-body contact models admit unique solutions when compliance is lumped at the contact points. This fact makes compliant models desirable in simulation environments, but the addition of compliance leads to stiff differential equations (assuming that the bodies are stiff as many every-day items typically are).
