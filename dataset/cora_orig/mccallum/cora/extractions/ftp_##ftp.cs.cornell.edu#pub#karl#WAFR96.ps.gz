Abstract: Programmable vector fields can be used to control a variety of flexible planar parts feeders. These devices can exploit exotic actuation technologies such as arrayed, massively-parallel microfabricated motion pixels or transversely vibrating (macroscopic) plates. These new automation designs promise great flexibility, speed, and dexterity|we believe they may be employed to orient, singulate, sort, feed, and assemble parts. However, since they have only recently been invented, programming and controlling them for manipulation tasks is challenging. When a part is placed on our devices, the programmed vector field induces a force and moment upon it. Over time, the part may come to rest in a dynamic equilibrium state. By chaining together sequences of vector fields, the equilibrium states of a part in the field may be cascaded to obtain a desired final state. The resulting strategies require no sensing and enjoy efficient planning algorithms. This paper begins by describing our experimental devices. In particular, we describe our progress in building the M-Chip (Manipulation Chip), a massively parallel array of programmable micro-motion pixels. As proof of concept, we demonstrate a prototype M-Chip containing over 11,000 silicon actuators in one square inch. Both the M-Chip, as well as macroscopic devices such as transversely vibrating plates, may be programmed with vector fields, and their behavior predicted and controlled using our equilibrium analysis. We demonstrate lower bounds (i.e., impossibility results) on what the devices cannot do, and results on a classification of control strategies yielding design criteria by which well-behaved manipulation strategies may be developed. We provide sufficient conditions for programmable fields to induce well-behaved equilibria on every part. We define composition operators to build complex strategies from simple ones, and show the resulting fields are also well-behaved. We discuss whether fields outside this class can be useful and free of pathology. Using these tools, we describe new manipulation algorithms. In particular, we improve existing planning algorithms by a quadratic factor, and the plan-length by a linear factor. Using our new and improved strategies, we show how to simultaneously orient and pose any part, without sensing, from an arbitrary initial configuration. We relax earlier dynamic and mechanical assumptions to obtain more robust and flexible strategies. Finally, we consider parts feeders that can only implement a very limited "vocabulary" of vector fields (as opposed to the pixel-wise programmability assumed above). We show how to plan and execute parts-posing and orienting strategies for these devices, but with a significant increase in planning complexity and some sacrifice in completeness guarantees. We discuss the tradeoff between mechanical complexity and planning complexity.

Reference-contexts: Therefore these switches are necessary for strategies with squeeze patterns. One may ask whether, using another class of potential field strategies, unique equilibria may be obtained without discrete switching. We believe that continuously varying vector fields of the form (1 t)f + t g, where t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> represents time, and f and g are K.-F. Bohringer, B. R. Donald, and N. C. MacDonald squeezes, may lead to vector fields that have this property. Here "+" denotes point-wise addition of vector fields, and we will write "f ; g" for the resulting continuously varying field. <p> Does there exist a universal field that, for every part P , has only one unique equilibrium (up to part symmetry)? Such a field could be used to build a universal parts feeder <ref> [1] </ref> Upper and Lower Bounds for Programmable Vector Fields that uniquely positions a part without the need of a clock, sensors, or programming. <p> We propose a combined radial and "gravitational" field R + ffiG which might have this property. ffi is a small positive constant, and G is defined as G (x; y) = (0; 1). This device design is inspired by the "universal gripper in <ref> [1] </ref>. Such a field could be obtained from a MEMS array that implements a unit radial force field. Instead of rectangular actuators in a regular grid, triangular actuators could be laid out in a polar-coordinate grid. The array could then be tilted slightly to obtain the gravity component.

Recall from Section 3.1 that in squeeze fields, the equilibria for connected polygons are discrete (except for a neutrally stable translation parallel to the squeeze line which we will disregard for the remainder of Section 3). To model our actuator arrays and vibratory devices, in [8] we made the following <p> alignment with squeeze fields <ref> [8] </ref>. Recall from Section 3.1 that in squeeze fields, the equilibria for connected polygons are discrete (except for a neutrally stable translation parallel to the squeeze line which we will disregard for the remainder of Section 3). To model our actuator arrays and vibratory devices, in [8] we made the following assumptions: Density: The generated forces can be described by a vector field, i.e. the individual microactuators are dense compared to the size of the moving part. 2 In particular, in [8] we assumed that k = O (1). 2Phase: The motion of a part has two <p> To model our actuator arrays and vibratory devices, in <ref> [8] </ref> we made the following assumptions: Density: The generated forces can be described by a vector field, i.e. the individual microactuators are dense compared to the size of the moving part. 2 In particular, in [8] we assumed that k = O (1). 2Phase: The motion of a part has two phases: (1) Pure translation towards l until the part is in translational equilibrium. (2) Motion in translational equilibrium until orientational equilibrium is reached. <p> If a part moves while in translational equilibrium, in general the motion is not a pure rotation, but also has a translational component. Therefore, relaxing assumption 2Phase is one of the key results of this paper. Definition 5 <ref> [8] </ref> Let be the orientation of a connected polygon P in a squeeze field, and let us assume that condition I holds. <p> This definition immediately implies the following lemma: Lemma 6 <ref> [8] </ref> Let P be a polygon with orientation in a squeeze field such that condition I holds. P is stable if t () = 0, t (+) 0, and t () 0. Otherwise P is unstable. <p> ffi) 0. 2 Using this lemma we can identify all stable orientations, which allows us to construct the squeeze function [25] of P (see Figure 5c), i.e. the mapping from an initial orientation of P to the stable equilibrium orientation that it will reach in the squeeze field: Lemma 7 <ref> [8] </ref> Let P be a polygonal part on an actuator array A such that assumptions Density and 2Phase hold. <p> positive moment (t &gt; 0) causes counterclockwise motion, and a negative moment (t &lt; 0) causes clockwise motion until the next root of t is reached. 2 We conclude that any connected polygonal part, when put in a squeeze field, reaches one of a finite number of possible orientation equilibria <ref> [8] </ref>. The motion of the part and, in particular, the mapping between initial orientation and equilibrium orientation is described by the squeeze function, which is derived from the turn function as described in Lemma 7. Note that all squeeze functions derived from turn functions are monotone step-shaped functions. <p> For example, to see this, consider squeezing a square-shaped part. Stable and unstable equilibria are switched. This shows that our mechanical analysis of equilibrium is different from that of the parallel-jaw gripper. Let us summarize these results: Theorem 8 <ref> [8] </ref> Let P be a polygon whose interior is connected. There exists an alignment strategy consisting of a sequence of squeeze fields that uniquely orients P up to symmetries. <p> This is not a potential field, which explains why the disk-shaped part has no equilibrium: Note that for example the integral on a cyclic path along the boundary of the disk is non-zero. Example: Morphing and combining vector fields. Our strategies from <ref> [8] </ref> (see Section 3) have switch points in time where the vector field changes discontinuously (Figure 4). This is because after one squeeze, for every part, the orientation equilibria form a finite set of possible configurations, but in general there exists no unique equilibrium (as shown in Section 3.2). <p> Upper and Lower Bounds for Programmable Vector Fields 6.2 Manipulation Grammars The development of devices that generate programmable vector fields is still in its infancy.

It was shown in <ref> [8] </ref> that every connected polygonal part P with n vertices has a finite number of stable orientation equilibria when P is placed into a squeeze field S.

Reference-contexts: A parts feeder is a machine that orients such parts before they are fed to an assembly station. Currently, the design of parts feeders is a black art that is responsible for up to 30% of the cost and 50% of workcell failures <ref> [10, for example] </ref>. Thus although part feeding accounts for a large portion of assembly cost, there is not much scientific basis for automating the process. <p> As they climb, a sequence of ba*es and cutouts in the track create a mechanical "filter" that causes parts in all but one orientation to fall back into the bowl for another attempt at running the gauntlet <ref> [10] </ref>. Sony's APOS parts feeder [27] uses an array of nests (silhouette traps) cut into a vibrating plate. The nests and the vibratory motion are designed so that the part will remain in the nest only in a particular orientation.

Reference-contexts: Non-potential fields can be used safely with the following methodology: Let H C = R 2 fi S 1 be the undesirable limit set. For example, H could be a limit cycle where the part spins forever. Let b P V (H) be the weak pre-image <ref> [33, 15] </ref> of H under the field V . If we can ensure that the part starts in a configuration z 62 b P V (H), it will not reach the unwanted limit cycle. <p> The issue is that if, for many poses, jM ()j is very small, then the orientation process will be slow. Better measures are also desirable. Uncertainty. In practice, neither the force vector field nor the part geometry will be exact, and both can only be characterized up to tolerances <ref> [15] </ref>. This is particularly important at micro scale.

Reference-contexts: However, for arbitrary fields (e.g. the force fields described in Section 2.2 which are induced by vibrating plates) such algorithms may not exist. Instead we can employ approximate methods to predict the behavior of the part in the force field (for more details also see <ref> [18] </ref>). These methods are typically numerical computations that involve simulating the part from a specific initial pose, until it reaches equilibrium. 4 We call the cost for such a computation the simulation complexity s (n).

Reference-contexts: Although the vibratory motion is under software control, specialized mechanical nests must be designed for each part [36]. The reason for the success of vibratory bowl feeders and the Sony APOS system is the underlying principle of sensorless manipulation <ref> [21] </ref> that allows parts positioning and orienting without sensor feedback. This principle is even more important at small scales, because sensor data will be less accurate and more difficult to obtain. <p> In robotics, minimalism has become increasingly influential.

Reference-contexts: This is true if and only if t ( + ffi) 0 and t ( ffi) 0. 2 Using this lemma we can identify all stable orientations, which allows us to construct the squeeze function <ref> [25] </ref> of P (see Figure 5c), i.e. the mapping from an initial orientation of P to the stable equilibrium orientation that it will reach in the squeeze field: Lemma 7 [8] Let P be a polygonal part on an actuator array A such that assumptions Density and 2Phase hold. <p> The motion of the part and, in particular, the mapping between initial orientation and equilibrium orientation is described by the squeeze function, which is derived from the turn function as described in Lemma 7. Note that all squeeze functions derived from turn functions are monotone step-shaped functions. Goldberg <ref> [25] </ref> has given an algorithm that automatically synthesizes a manipulation strategy to uniquely orient a part, given its squeeze function. While Gold-berg's algorithm was designed for squeezes with a robotic parallel-jaw gripper, in fact, it is more general, and can be used for arbitrary monotone step-shaped squeeze functions. <p> This means that the image of its corresponding squeeze function is a set of E discrete values. Given such a squeeze function, Goldberg's algorithm <ref> [25] </ref> constructs alignment strategies with O (E) steps. Planning complexity is O (E 2 ). 2 K.-F. Bohringer, B. R. Donald, and N. C. MacDonald Goldberg's strategies [25] have the same complexity bounds for convex and non-convex parts, because when using squeeze grasps with a parallel-jaw gripper, only the convex hull <p> Given such a squeeze function, Goldberg's algorithm <ref> [25] </ref> constructs alignment strategies with O (E) steps.

MacDonald Goldberg's strategies [25] have the same complexity bounds for convex and non-convex parts, because when using squeeze grasps with a parallel-jaw gripper, only the convex hull of the part need be considered. This is not the case for programmable vector fields, where manipulation strategies for non-convex parts are more expensive. <p> Hence if assumption 2Phase is relaxed, this idea still enables us to simplify the general motion planning problem (as formulated e.g. by Lozano-Perez, Mason, and Taylor in [33]) to that of Erd-mann and Mason [21].

Arrays with individually addressable actuators at various orientations are possible (see <ref> [9, 8, 31, 7, 42] </ref>) but require significant development effort. There are also limitations on the resolution of the devices given by fabrication constraints. For the vibrating plate device from Section 2.2 the fields are even more constrained by the vibrational modes of the plate.

The Scream process is low-temperature, and does not interfere with traditional VLSI [40]. Hence it opens the door to building monolithic microelectromechanical systems with integrated microactuators and control circuitry on the same wafer. Our design is based on microfabricated torsional resonators [35].
