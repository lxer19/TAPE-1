Abstract: This paper considers a few variants of Krylov subspace techniques for solving linear systems on parallel computers. The goal of these variants is to avoid global dot-products which hamper parallelism in this class of methods. They are based on replacing the standard Euclidean inner product with a discrete inner product over polynomials. The set of knots for the discrete inner product is obtained by estimating eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix.

Reference-contexts: In subsequent steps, the k 's are updated from the eigenvalues of the following Generalized Eigenvalue Problem: ~ W T m This is obtained from a projection method onto the Krylov subspace <ref> [1] </ref>. This operation is expensive because it requires forming the matrix ~ W T m which requires m 2 =2 inner products.

Reference-contexts: Otherwise a Hessenberg recurrence similar to that of the Arnoldi process is used. These polynomials are computed only in the form of the values which they take in the knots used for the discrete inner products. As is done for QMR (see <ref> [3] </ref>), we then consider this new basis to be orthonormal and perform a quasi-minimization of the resulting least-squares problem which yields a quasi-minimal residual solution. The set of knots used in the discrete inner product, which are approximate eigenvalues of A, are then updated and the process is repeated. <p> In the present situation, ~ W m+1 is not orthonormal so an exact minimizer of the residual norm may be difficult to obtain. However, we can find a quasi-minimum solution which consists of ignoring the non-orthogonality of the system W m+1 as is done in the QMR algorithm <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> At each step there is the potential for a breakdown in Line 6 of the Stieljes procedure. If this happens it is probably best to restart the algorithm though look-ahead strategies similar to the ones developed for the nonsymmetric Lanczos algorithm and QMR are also possible <ref> [3] </ref>. 4 Preconditioning It is also possible to precondition the ADOP method and the three preconditioning options, left, right and split preconditioning are all available. 4.1 Left Preconditioning When considering left preconditioning, the linear system M 1 Ax = M 1 b is solved by building the Krylov subspace K m

Reference-contexts: w m+1 = p m (A)r 0 . 2.2 Computation of the basis W m Before computing the basis W m it is necessary to start by obtaining the coefficients ff i ; fi i of the three-term recurrence with the standard Stieljes procedure using the discrete inner product, see <ref> [4] </ref>. These coefficients can be represented as a tridiagonal matrix T m of size (m + 1) fi m.

Reference-contexts: From the point of view of speed, it appears that the indefinite inner product is superior. The second part compares the ADOP method with GMRES method through the use of the P SPARSLIB library (see <ref> [7] </ref>) and larger matrices.
