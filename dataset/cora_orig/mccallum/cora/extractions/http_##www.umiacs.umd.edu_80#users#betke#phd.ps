Reference-contexts: In Section 3.5.3 we give the necessary and sufficient conditions for A T A being nonsingular and argue that they will almost always be fulfilled in practice. Matrix A + = (A T A) 1 A T is often called the pseudo inverse of matrix A (see for example <ref> [1, 98] </ref>). <p> 2 b n b T n b 2 b T n b n C C A Instead of inverting the matrix A T A directly, we write matrix A T A as a sum of a diagonal matrix and two matrices that are outer products (or Grammian matrices, see Albert <ref> [1] </ref>). <p> In this form r can be calculated (without inverting nD b x b T x b y b T directly) using the following well-known lemma <ref> [1] </ref>: Lemma 12 If matrix K is nonsingular and (K 1 h) T h 6= 1, then (K hh T ) 1 = K 1 + 1 (K 1 h) T h Proof: The proof follows directly by verifying equation I = (K hh T )(K 1 + 1 (K 1 <p> We expect better results for this scenario in which the robot can take advantage of information provided by all of its surrounding. Indeed, our results show that the error in position has length 8:9 cm for ' uniformly distributed within <ref> [1; 1] </ref>, length 17:6 cm for ' uniformly distributed within [2; 2], and length 42:6 cm for ' uniformly distributed within [5; 5]. The results of the experiments are summarized in Figures 3-14 and 3-15. <p> The error kp actual pk in meters is shown as a function of measurement errors in degrees. 91 left, the distributions of the length of error vectors kp actual pk for ' uniformly distributed within <ref> [1; 1] </ref>, [2; 2], and [5; 5]. <p> Otherwise, they are accepted if e (r j1 r j )=T j &gt; ~ (4.1) where ~ is randomly chosen to be in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, T j is the temperature parameter, and r j is the sampled correlation coefficient in the j-th iteration. For a sufficient temperature this allows "jumps" out of local maxima.

Reference-contexts: This avoids a crucial problem addressed extensively in robotics research: a mobile robot often does not know where it is in its environment. Therefore, various strategies have been developed that keep track of the robot's position in its environment (e.g. <ref> [22, 41, 38, 2] </ref>). For the case of a confident explorer, this is easily solved using dead-reckoning. Since the sensors are not assumed to involve any measurement errors, the trajectory and location of the robot can be computed exactly. This is not possible for adjusting explorers. <p> Check the consistency of the candidate position using the fourth ray. Since there are n (n 1)(n 2)(n 3) permutations of a set of four points, the naive algorithm takes O (n 4 ) time. Avis and Imai <ref> [2] </ref> address the same problem as Sugihara and describe an O (kn 3 ) algorithm. They also give an O (k 2 n 3 ) version of their algorithm for the case that angle measurements have errors (they assume worst-case error bounds). <p> Indeed, our results show that the error in position has length 8:9 cm for ' uniformly distributed within [1; 1], length 17:6 cm for ' uniformly distributed within <ref> [2; 2] </ref>, and length 42:6 cm for ' uniformly distributed within [5; 5]. The results of the experiments are summarized in Figures 3-14 and 3-15.

Reference-contexts: There are several approaches published in the literature that either reduce the size of the search space or that direct the search towards areas in the search space for which a match is more likely <ref> [51, 52, 86, 81, 7] </ref>. In this chapter a new approach is proposed that uses both such techniques. We discuss the problem of how certain landmarks, for example traffic signs, can be recognized by an autonomous vehicle or robot.

Reference-contexts: There are w paths leading off start position s and the goal (a pasture) is somewhere on one path. The explorer (a cow) does not known on which path the goal is and tries to find it as quickly as possible. Baeza-Yates, Culberson and Rawlings <ref> [8] </ref> give an optimal deterministic algorithm which was improved by Kao, Reif, and Tate [62] using randomization. In the case that there are two paths (w = 2) the graph is a chain-graph. <p> Layered graphs of width 2, however, allow "shortcuts". For searching such a graph, Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [89] give an optimal algorithm with competitive ratio of 9. Baeza-Yates, Culberson, and Rawlings <ref> [8] </ref> describe an algorithm for searching a goal t at distance n from s in a grid graph. If the distance n is known in advance, the algorithm takes 9n 2 steps. Otherwise it takes 2n 2 + 5n + 2 steps. <p> Otherwise it takes 2n 2 + 5n + 2 steps.

Reference-contexts: Using the correlation as a measure of successful recognition is also advantageous because it is a very robust measure. That is, it is relatively insensitive to fluctuations in the environment compared to higher resolution methods, as is well documented in spectral, bearing, and range estimation problems <ref> [60, 9] </ref>. 4.4 Generating templates from model images A template T (x; y) is generated from a model image M (x; y) by choosing three parameters that describe a transformation from M into T .

Reference-contexts: Matched filtering has been used much earlier in the areas of radar, sonar, and signal processing [87]. Valuable information for visual object recognition can be obtained from that literature. Although template matching has been widely used in computer vision <ref> [95, 10, 104] </ref>, a crucial problem with the method is the size of the search space [81, 77].

Reference-contexts: Automatically recognizing traffic signs in images is very valuable for mobile robot or autonomous vehicle navigation. A robot that can recognize a traffic sign as a familiar landmark in its map of the 96 environment can then use this information to localize itself in its environment <ref> [16, 22] </ref>. Our method stands apart from previous approaches to traffic sign recognition because first, it is efficiently applied to real-world landscape images (as opposed to Ettinger's isolated signs [44]), and second, it does not rely on color perception which is very sensitive to lighting changes.

Reference-contexts: It is about the design and analysis of efficient learning algorithms for confident explorers. Similar formal approaches to environment learning have been studied previously in the context of graph theory, computational geometry, on-line algorithms, and automata theory (e.g., <ref> [89, 21, 93] </ref>). In this related work, formal models are defined that try to capture the difficulties that lie in the confident explorer's limited knowledge of its environment. <p> They also provide a lower bound of ( n) for this problem where n is the shortest distance between s and t.

Reference-contexts: There is a wide variety of approaches to handle uncertainties associated with a mobile robot. Some approaches differ from our approach in the way the robot's environment is represented. We use a two-dimensional metric map to describe the environment of the robot. Brooks <ref> [23] </ref> proposes a method to model and reduce uncertainties in the position of a moving robot that uses both topological and metric representations of the environment. Relationships between metrically represented regions of the environment are represented in a topological map.

Reference-contexts: The piecemeal learning algorithms we presented are aimed at robots of the future that have such precise sensors that they can indeed be confident in their sensory input. However, for piecemeal exploration of certain environments, for example, exploration of a huge system of pipes in a factory <ref> [24] </ref>, current technology should be sufficient. It would be interesting to implement our piecemeal algorithms on a physical robot to explore such an environment. 119

We believe that with our method we can generalize common approaches to recognize faces <ref> [26] </ref> by using images that are not normalized but contain more general scenes with varied backgrounds. 117 Chapter 5 Conclusions The central question addressed in this thesis is how a navigating robot can cope with uncertainty.

Reference-contexts: We can view this as a mapping f of points w = fi k in the complex w-plane into the complex z-plane where each landmark z k is a point in the z-plane: f (w) = w 1 This mapping is called a Mobius transformation (see for example <ref> [31] </ref>). The Mobius transformation maps the line w = fi in the w-plane into a circle in the z-plane. Since f (0) = 0, the circle passes through the origin of the z-plane.

Reference-contexts: The optimization technique fast simulated annealing is applied to avoid the cost of brute-force search by directing the search successfully. It reduces the search time by orders of magnitude. Recent publications in the sonar literature <ref> [32, 71] </ref> show that fast simulated annealing has been very successful in coherent signal extraction and localization in noisy environments. We use it in a similar way for incoherent image processing. Kirkpatrick et al. [63] show how to implement a Metropolis algorithm [85] to simulate annealing of combinatorial optimization problems. <p> We also obtain good results using simulated annealing only for the location parameters, and a gradient ascent with large enough random perturbations <ref> [32] </ref> for the remaining parameters.

We address mobile robot localization as a problem of relating robot-centered information with global map information. Relating a camera-centered coordinate system to an external coordinate system is called exterior orientation in the field of pho-togrammetry (see for example <ref> [56] </ref>). Photogrammetry deals with the problem of how objects in the environment are related to their images in camera systems with different orientations and positions. For robot manipulators, the problem of relating a camera-centered coordinate system to a world-centered coordinate system is called the hand-eye transformation.

Reference-contexts: The optimization technique fast simulated annealing is applied to avoid the cost of brute-force search by directing the search successfully. It reduces the search time by orders of magnitude. Recent publications in the sonar literature <ref> [32, 71] </ref> show that fast simulated annealing has been very successful in coherent signal extraction and localization in noisy environments. We use it in a similar way for incoherent image processing. Kirkpatrick et al. [63] show how to implement a Metropolis algorithm [85] to simulate annealing of combinatorial optimization problems. <p> As a criteria for stopping the annealing process, we simply put a limit on the search length L. Although this does not ensure convergence to the optimal correlation coefficient, the solutions we obtain for the parameters are generally sufficient and solve the recognition task. As Kuperman et al. <ref> [71] </ref> point out, if the search problem involves different kinds of parameters the annealing algorithm is rather analogous to the cooling of a mixture of liquids, each of which have different freezing points.

Reference-contexts: We call such robots "path-planning agents," because they can plan their navigation routes off-line, prior to any physical movement. The assumption that a robot actually has complete knowledge of its environment can only be justified for certain applications <ref> [30, 72, 42] </ref>. The thesis addresses more predominant scenarios in which the navigating robot has to cope with uncertainty in its environment. Because of this uncertainty, such robots have a limited ability to plan their navigation route before they start moving. <p> They consider the case that the robot's sensing is perfect within disks around these landmarks and null outside. The algorithm runs in time O (k 4 log k). 21 2.2.3 Path-planning agents A related problem on graph traversal is the "Chinese Postman Problem" proposed by Kwan <ref> [72] </ref> and solved by Edmonds and Johnson [42] (more on this problem in Section 2.5.1).

Reference-contexts: Robotics has evolved to a point where mobile robots are commercially used, for example, as meal delivery robots in hospitals [45]. There are other working prototypes, such as vehicles that navigate autonomously on highways [37, 13, 91] and mobile robots that navigate in office buildings <ref> [57, 25, 33, 96, 82, 54, 55] </ref>. These successes have motivated and excellerated research in various areas. There is a wide range of work: at one end of the spectrum are systems implemented on physical robots; at the other end are algorithms solving fundamental mathematical problems. <p> In contrast, adjusting explorers often represent their knowledge about their environment in quantitative, geometric maps. The thesis follows this way of representing a robot's environment. (An example for an adjusting robot using a topological map is Mataric's system <ref> [82] </ref>.) There is a trade-off: geometric maps are more detailed than topological, but they are more difficult to obtain and use. 1.1 Contributions of the thesis The thesis combines three independent results in the fields of machine learning, robotics, and computer vision. <p> Relationships between metrically represented regions of the environment are represented in a topological map. He calls such regions "uncertainty manifolds." They bound the robot's location estimate in space. Mataric <ref> [82] </ref> describes a physical robot for environment-learning and navigation that uses a landmark-based topological representation of the environment. Elfes [43] 67 describes a navigation system that consists of several map-building levels: it builds symbolic maps, geometric maps, and sonar sensor maps.

Reference-contexts: Several authors follow such a statistical approach for robot navigation, for example, Kosaka and Kak [67], Crowley [38], Leonard and Durrant-Whyte [74], Watanabe and Yuta [102], Burlina, DeMenthon and Davis [27] and Matthies and Shafer <ref> [83] </ref>. We show empirically that the distribution of the position estimate that our method computes is normal if certain assumptions on the error in the input data hold. Approaches to handle uncertainties in a robot's position can also be distinguished by the kind of data available to the robot.

Reference-contexts: There are several approaches published in the literature that either reduce the size of the search space or that direct the search towards areas in the search space for which a match is more likely <ref> [51, 52, 86, 81, 7] </ref>. In this chapter a new approach is proposed that uses both such techniques. We discuss the problem of how certain landmarks, for example traffic signs, can be recognized by an autonomous vehicle or robot.

Valuable information for visual object recognition can be obtained from that literature.

Reference-contexts: The Chinese Postman Problem can be solved by a polynomial time algorithm if the graph is either undirected or directed [42]. The Chinese Postman problem for a mixed graph that has undirected and directed edges was shown to be NP-complete by Papadimitriou <ref> [88] </ref>. We do not know an optimal off-line algorithm for the Weak Postman Problem; it may be NP-hard. This is an interesting open problem. We give an efficient off-line piecemeal search algorithm for arbitrary undirected graphs. The algorithm uses an "interrupted depth-first search" and solves the Weak Postman Problem approximately.

Reference-contexts: It is about the design and analysis of efficient learning algorithms for confident explorers. Similar formal approaches to environment learning have been studied previously in the context of graph theory, computational geometry, on-line algorithms, and automata theory (e.g., <ref> [89, 21, 93] </ref>). In this related work, formal models are defined that try to capture the difficulties that lie in the confident explorer's limited knowledge of its environment. <p> The cow-path problem for the case of two paths is similar to the problem of exploring layered graphs of width 2. Layered graphs of width 2, however, allow "shortcuts". For searching such a graph, Papadimitriou and Yannakakis <ref> [89] </ref> give an optimal algorithm with competitive ratio of 9.

Reference-contexts: In the field of visual object recognition, the idea of matching a model of an object with an image by exhaustive search is standard (e.g. <ref> [94] </ref>). However, a large number of parameters is necessary to mold the model image for a parameter match. This makes the search space extremely large.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we use a "least squares method" to find a solution for which the average error in the n (n 1) equations is minimized. 3.5.1 Least squares errors and the pseudo inverse The "least squares method" is a standard method for solving overdetermined sys tems of equations <ref> [98] </ref>. In the following we rederive this method for our particular overdetermined system of equations. To solve the matrix equation A r = c we choose ratio vector r so as to minimize the "average" error in the n (n 1) equations. <p> In Section 3.5.3 we give the necessary and sufficient conditions for A T A being nonsingular and argue that they will almost always be fulfilled in practice. Matrix A + = (A T A) 1 A T is often called the pseudo inverse of matrix A (see for example <ref> [1, 98] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Triangulation is a well-known technique for finding a position by means of bearings from fixed points in the environment. Sugihara <ref> [99] </ref> addresses a version of the localization problem where the points in the environment look identical (to the contrary, we use landmarks that are distinguishable). The robot observes k such points in an environment that contains n points.

As a criteria for stopping the annealing process, we simply put a limit on the search length L. Although this does not ensure convergence to the optimal correlation coefficient, the solutions we obtain for the parameters are generally sufficient and solve the recognition task.
