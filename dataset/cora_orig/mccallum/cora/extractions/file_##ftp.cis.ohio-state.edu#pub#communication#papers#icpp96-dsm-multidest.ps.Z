Abstract: Current generation DSM systems use point-to-point (unicast) messages for cache invalidations. This incurs a large number of control messages, heavy network traffic, and high occupancy at home nodes. This paper introduces a new approach to reduce these overheads by using multidestination-based reservation and gather worms for distributing invalidation requests and collecting acknowledgments. Different grouping schemes to generate multidestination worms on networks supporting deterministic (e-cube) or adaptive (turn-model) routing are investigated to implement the fully-mapped cache-coherence protocol. For different applications on a 2D mesh system, our simulation results indicate that up to 15% reduction in overall execution time can be achieved by using multides-tination messages.

Reference-contexts: This demonstrates further reduction in volume of network traffic, occupancy at the home node, and most importantly the invalidation latency. Other issues in this MR-MA framework, like deadlock-freedom, vitual cut-through, etc., have also been investigated. Interested readers are encouraged to refer to <ref> [1] </ref> for details. 5 Grouping Schemes It can be seen that i-reserve and i-gather worms must be generated on-the-fly by the directory controller because of the dynamic property of sharing. <p> After the final destination of an i-reserve worm receives the message, its directory controller does a grouping with itself as the source node and the home node as the final destination in order to generate appropriate routing header for the corresponding i-gather worm. Readers are encouraged to refer to <ref> [1] </ref> for further details. 5.2 E-cube Routing 5.2.1 Up-and-Down Column Grouping (UD) Scheme In an up-and-down column grouping (UD) scheme, a home node needs maximum two i-reserve worms in each column for an invalidation transaction.

Reference-contexts: Such unicast message passing incurs high traffic and contention in the network. It also makes the home nodes as hot-spots in the system. This has considerable impact on the occupancy of messages at directories <ref> [3] </ref>. Such overheads get reflected as high-latency for write operations, leading to degradation on the overall system performance. In WWT [5], the invalidation requests are broadcasted using a dedicated broadcast network. This leads to a costly design. <p> Home node occupancy <ref> [3] </ref> reflects the amount of processing time required at a home node in order to send the requests and receive the acknowledgments. It is proportional to the number of messages sent from and received by the home node.

Each router interface can have a set of buffer entries containing special flags. An `on' state of such a flag indicates that the associated processing node has arrived at the gather execution point. <p> Assume that the fully-mapped protocol is used to enforce coherence. Let us consider organizing the presence bits in the column major order and use the bit string address encoding for multidestination worms <ref> [9] </ref>. Hence, different portions of the presence bits can be directly taken as the routing headers of the i-reserve worms. Grouping for I-gather Worms: In all the schemes we discuss, the final destination node of an i-reserve worm initiates an i-gather worm to collect the i-ack signals.

Reference-contexts: Both patterns belong to the class of collective communication [7]. Currently the wormhole-routing switching technique [8] is the trend in building scalable parallel systems. In recent years, many new adaptive routing schemes and multicasting schemes <ref> [10] </ref> have been proposed for wormhole routed systems. These developments lead to a natural question whether we can take advantage of these schemes to reduce cache coherence overheads in DSM systems. Consider current generation DSM systems, which use directory-based protocols to enforce conventional sequential consistency. <p> This leads to a costly design. Recently, Bhuyan et al. [6] have proposed an embedded hierarchical ring broadcast mechanism for implementing fast invalidations. However, this approach leads to high latency for invalidations. Recently multidestination message-passing mechanisms have been introduced for wormhole networks to achieve low-latency multicast <ref> [10] </ref> and gather [9] operations on distributed memory systems. In this paper, we propose a set of multidestination-based reservation and gather worms to implement cache-coherence with reduced overheads. <p> We use a multidestination message passing approach to accomplish this. 3 Multidestination Message Passing The multidestination message passing mechanism allows data to be delivered to or picked up from multiple nodes with a single message. A new Base-Routing-Confirmed-Path (BRCP) model has been recently proposed in <ref> [10] </ref> to implement multidestination mechanism on wormhole networks with different routing schemes. 3.1 The BRCP Model a 2D mesh supporting two kinds of routing. <p> The worm uses forward-and-absorb capability at the router interface of each intermediate destination. Using such worms, sophisticated multicasting schemes are feasible to implement a multicast with reduced latency <ref> [10] </ref>. A multidestination gather worm collects information from multiple nodes at their respective router interfaces [9]. Each router interface can have a set of buffer entries containing special flags. An `on' state of such a flag indicates that the associated processing node has arrived at the gather execution point. <p> This demonstrates considerable potential to reduce occupancy at the home node as well as the invalidation latency. Besides supporting forward-and-absorb mechanism at each router interface <ref> [10] </ref>, the MI-UA framework does not require any additional modifications to the current generation DSM systems. The main thrust of this framework is to reduce occupancy of the home node and the volume of network traffic incurred in the request phase of an invalidation transaction.
