Abstract: It is demonstrated that charged particles may acquire unusual statistics in topologically nontrivial two-dimensional samples placed in strong magnetic fields. These novel statistics follow from an analysis of the self-adjoint extensions of the Landau Hamiltonian which are partially classified by the UIR's of the fundamental group. Superselection rules corresponding to different quantum theories are found. Super-symmetry arguments are used to construct exact ground states.

Reference-contexts: In two dimensions the possibilities are much richer. Indeed, in two dimensions it is the braid group which is relevant to statistics, not the permutation group as in higher dimensions. <ref> [1] </ref> Until recently, there was no reason to take these extra possibilities seriously, since the physical dimension of space seems to exclude these exotic possibilities as mere theoretical curiosities. <p> The momentum operator is formally hermitian, yet any function exp (ffx) is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue iff. Thus, one must be very careful to specify the allowed functions on which the operator may act. In the present instance, if a domain too small D 0 (^p) = f : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! C j (0) = (1) = 0g is set, then the adjoint operator ^p fl has a domain too large to exclude the above exponential eigenfunction. <p> Thus v 2 D (^p) = f : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! C j (0) = e i (1)g and hu; ^pvi h^pu; vi = u (0)v (0) u (1)v (1) = 0 (3:1) together imply that u 2 D (^p), or that ^p acting on D (^p) is self-adjoint.

In general, whenever the configuration space, Q, is multiply connected, there exist inequivalent quantizations corresponding to different unitary, irreducible representations (UIR's) of 1 (Q).

Reference-contexts: Sorkin, in ref. 5. When the homotopy group 1 (Q) is non-abelian, some of these quantizations will require the use of vector-valued wave functions. Such wave functions are used, for example, in the quantization of the collective rotational motion of odd-A nuclei with three distinct moments of inertia. <ref> [6] </ref> In this spirit, we investigate the quantization of planar motion in a uniform magnetic field. The magnetic field makes the problem tractable 2 by preventing the electrons from wandering off to infinity, but is interesting because of its connections to studies of the quantum Hall effect.

Reference-contexts: Ordinarily, we think of this in terms of the Hamiltonian being hermitian. Technically, however, this is not enough. The proper requirement is that the Hamiltonian be self-adjoint. A self-adjoint operator has real eigenvalues while a merely hermitian operator may have complex eigenvalues. The classic example <ref> [7] </ref> of the latter situation is the momentum operator ^p = i d dx acting on functions of a real variable. The momentum operator is formally hermitian, yet any function exp (ffx) is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue iff.

Reference-contexts: A better argument starts from a supersymmetrized Hamiltonian, since the supersymmetry guarantees that the spectrum is non-negative. It is well known that the supersymmetrization of the 13 spectrum generating algebra for the Landau levels describes the same physics with the introduction of electron spin. <ref> [8] </ref> In addition to the bosonic oscillator ^a, ^a y we introduce a fermionic oscillator ^ ~, ^ ~ y from which we construct a supercharge Q = p j!j (^a ^ ~ y + ^a y ^ ~).

Reference-contexts: Given any set of punctures and any desired monodromies around these punctures, there exists a vector-valued analytic function in the plane minus those punctures which has just those monodromies. <ref> [10] </ref> This guarantees the existence of many such ground states, so that (4.11) is not an isolated example and its monodromies are by no means the only unitary monodromies possible. 17 5. Conclusion We have considered quantization of charged particles in a uniform magnetic field in a topologically nontrivial plane.
