Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of routing many-to-many multicast connections with bandwidth reservation. We devise a routing algorithm which provides not only connectivity but also bandwidth among multicast members at a low cost. After briefly addressing the problem complexity (NP-Complete), we move on to design polynomial time algorithms, for scalability purposes, some of which with worst case bounds on performance. A simulation study is used to illustrate the al gorithms' performance and trade offs.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 uses the hard results to design polynomial algorithms with worst case guarantees. Section 5 presents simulation results to illustrate the algorithms behavior and performance. Conclusions are drawn in the last section. Proofs of theorems/lemmas used in this paper, left out for space constraints, can be found at <ref> [Cavendish97] </ref>. 2 Related Work Bandwidth constrained unicast (pt-pt) routing has been shown to be of polynomial complexity [Wang95], and thus scalable with the size of the network. <p> The algorithm is called Bidirect Dijkstra (BD-Dijkstra), and is similar to the original Dijkstra algorithm. The difference is that only links which have sufficient bandwidth in both directions are considered in a relaxation step. BD-Dijkstra's pseudo-code, together with proof of correctness and complexity analysis, can be found in <ref> [Cavendish97] </ref>. 3.2 Multicast Tree Problems We now focus our attention to larger S and D sets. We are interested on a Multipoint Connectivity Structure (MCS), called multicast tree, defined as: Definition 3. <p> Steiner Tree problems are known to be NP-Complete. Problems of such nature with additional constraints are called constrained Steiner Tree problems. Our approach, therefore, is to provide polynomial time algorithms, for sake of scalability, with worst case performance guarantees. In <ref> [Cavendish97] </ref>, we have established theoretical hard results about the mtree problems defined above from which worst case guarantees can be drawn. These are results regarding both feasibility and cost, which we now state, starting with the former. Theorem 1 The problem of finding a feasible multicast tree is NP-Complete. <p> These are results regarding both feasibility and cost, which we now state, starting with the former. Theorem 1 The problem of finding a feasible multicast tree is NP-Complete. Regarding cost, it can be proven that: Theorem 2 <ref> [Cavendish97] </ref> Unless N P DT IM E (n log log n ), given an instance of the bandwidth constrained minimum cost Steiner tree problem with k =j S [D j sites, there is no polynomial time approximation algorithm that outputs a feasible Steiner tree with cost at most R times that <p> The algorithm to find such path, BD-Dijkstra, is polynomial <ref> [Cavendish97] </ref>. 2.2 Find a minimum cost matching of largest cardinality in G i . <p> They are basically: the specification of a cluster bandwidth, in step (2.1); the election of the cluster head, in step (2.4). Note that, when considering minimum paths in step (2.1), any pair of cluster heads should be consider, regardless whether they are source-source, desdination-destination, or source-destination type (see <ref> [Cavendish97] </ref>). The following lemma is needed to bound the cost of the resulting mtree: Lemma 1 [Ravi93] Let T be a tree with an even number of marked vertices. <p> When compared with BCST-algorithms, SPTree algorithm outputs a feasible tree less often and with higher cost, specially for large size multicast groups. Overall, BCST-algorithms have performance in between these two heuristics reagarding both cost and success rate. More comprehensive simulation results can be found in <ref> [Cavendish97] </ref>. 6 Conclusion and Future Work We have analysed the problem of computing a Steiner Tree which is constrained by bandwidth requirements of its connecting vertices. This problem finds applications in multimedia networks, in which members of a multicast connection, with well defined bandwidth requirements, wish to communicate.

Reference-contexts: Multicast traffic is typically carried through one (Core Based Tree) or more (Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol) multicast trees <ref> [Deering96] </ref>, for efficiency of network resources. We address the problem of constructing multi-cast trees, so as to provide not only connectivity among members of a multicast connection, but also bandwidth necessary to carry the traffic injected by mul-ticast members. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes related work.

Reference-contexts: However, for multicast connections, even the construction of unconstrained Steiner Trees is an NP-Complete problem. Although the problem of constructing Steiner trees is hardly new (e.g. [Smith83]), its study has been intensified in the last ten years due to its direct applicability to multimedia networks <ref> [Frank85] </ref>. Moreover, multimedia connections are likely to add constraints to feasible trees, such as bandwidth and delay. Research work on the construction of Steiner trees with such constraints is less abundant in the literature.

Reference-contexts: Although the minimum cost matching problem is in P T IM E, we have chosen an approximation algorithm by Goemans at al. <ref> [Goemans93] </ref>, with worst case of twice the minimum cost matching, to reduce the simulations' computation time. Their algorithm runs in O (jV j 2 log jV j) time, which is lower than BD-Dijkstra Bandwidth Constrained Low Cost Multicast Trees 7 Fig. 2.

Reference-contexts: The work is limited, in a sense that it assumes that every multicast member has the same bandwidth needs, and does not provide performance guarantees of any kind. <ref> [Ravi95] </ref> establishes hard results, and proposes algorithms for the construction of constrained Steiner tree problems with worst case guarantees, where the constraints are the diameter of the tree and the maximum degree of a vertex. <p> Based on Theorem 2, we advocate the use of a cluster type of polynomial time algorithm <ref> [Ravi95] </ref> to solve problem 2, since such strategy is likely to provide a ln factor bound on the mtree cost. 4 A cluster algorithm for low cost mtrees The basic idea is to design an algorithm that works in phases.

Reference-contexts: Using the same strategy for point-to-multipoint (pt-mtp) connections, a minimum cost spanning tree can be constructed with the same polynomial complexity.
