Reference-contexts: Why did they do this? At this point, we can only speculate. My first reaction was to think that it was due to the excessively solicitous attitude taken by many male mudders towards those with female personas (one might think, given the amount of gender-swapping <ref> [Bruckman 93] </ref> on MUDs, that they would learn better, but apparently not). However, Robyn commented that even female (or at least female-persona) mudders gave her the same advice.

Reference-contexts: very simple pattern-match on its input, looking for particular strings of characters separated by strings of any characters in between, without generating the detailed parse trees characteristic of most NLP. (This describes her parser as of around 1992, and the parser used in all of these transcripts; Julias current parser <ref> [Mauldin 94] </ref> is more sophisticated.) What makes Julias conversation skills so powerful, as bots go, is that these sets of patterns were very cleverly grouped into useful equivalence classes by her programmer. <p> We have also glimpsed at her internals; <ref> [Mauldin 94] </ref> has a bit more to say about this. We have omitted several other aspects of her normal operation, such as those involving money, Delphi-polling, calcula tions, and the importance of randomness in her responses.
