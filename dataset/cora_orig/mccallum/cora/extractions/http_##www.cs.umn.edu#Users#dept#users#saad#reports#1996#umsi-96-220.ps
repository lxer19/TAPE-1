Title: Preserving Symmetry in Preconditioned Krylov Subspace Methods  
Author: T. F. Chan E. Chow Y. Saad and M. C. Yeung 
Date: November 24, 1997  
Abstract: We consider the problem of solving a linear system Ax = b when A is nearly symmetric and when the system is preconditioned by a symmetric positive definite matrix M. In the symmetric case, one can recover symmetry by using M-inner products in the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm. This idea can also be used in the nonsymmetric case, and near symmetry can be preserved similarly. Like CG, the new algorithms are mathematically equivalent to split preconditioning, but do not require M to be factored. Better robustness in a specific sense can also be observed. When combined with truncated versions of iterative methods, tests show that this is more effective than the common practice of forfeiting near-symmetry altogether.

Reference-contexts: In Section 2, it is shown how alternative inner products may be used to preserve symmetry in GMRES. Section 3 considers the use of truncated iterative methods when the preconditioned system is close to being symmetric. This has been hypothesized by many authors, for example, Axelsson <ref> [2] </ref> and Meyer [5]. In Section 4 we consider the symmetrically preconditioned Bi-CG algorithm. Section 5 tests these algorithms numerically using a Navier-Stokes problem parameterized by the Reynolds number, and thus nearness to symmetry.

Reference-contexts: Again, the same statement can be made about right-preconditioning. All that must be noticed is that the same minimization (16) is taking place, and that the minimization is over the same subspace in each of the left, right, and split preconditioning options <ref> [7, Sec. 9.3.4] </ref>. <p> We also performed the same experiments with orthogonal projection methods, namely the Full Orthogonalization Method (FOM) and its truncated variant, the Direct Incomplete Orthogonalization Method (DIOM) <ref> [7] </ref>. The results were very similar to the results above, and are not shown here. Indeed, the development of the algorithms and the theory above is identical for these methods.

To suggest that truncated iterative methods may be effective in cases of near symmetry, we study the asymptotic behavior of the iterates of DQGMRES as the coefficient matrix A varies from nonsymmetry to (skew) symmetry.
