Abstract: This paper presents a new and simple procedure to identify link mass parameters used for gravity compensation and on-line automatic torque sensor calibration for a robot manipulator. The approach employs single-joint rotation and a recursive procedure that proceeds distally to proximally to identify composite mass moments. Experimental results are presented for the Sar-cos Dextrous Arm.

Reference-contexts: Even for fast motions, the use of a PD controller with gravity compensation apparently performs almost as well as a full feedforward controller that accommodates full inertial terms <ref> [1] </ref>. Figure 1 shows the block diagram for such a compensator. Gravity compensation (GComp) is particularly important when using a force-reflecting exoskeleton in teleoperation, such as the Sarcos Dextrous Arm Master. It is exceptionally burdensome for the operator to lift the weight of the master when attempting force reflection. <p> Hence it is imperative that the weight of the master should be automatically compensated. It would be desirable to cancel inertial forces as well, but the typical small-motion tasks using a master mean that gravity loading dominates. Moreover, attempting to reduce or cancel inertia is known to be tricky <ref> [1] </ref>, as instability easily results. We propose a simple method for gravity compensation, which is a natural extension of earlier work on torque sensor calibration [11]. This torque sensor calibration method is the only published method that can calibrate manipulator joint torque sensors "in vivo" (without disassembly).

Reference-contexts: The simulation is done in Matlab TM , using the Robotics Toolbox from Corke <ref> [3] </ref> and the System Identification Toolbox from Math-works. Arbitrarily assumed mass moment parameters (Table 1) are used to generate gravity torque for each joint when the link rotates about the joint. These mass moments m i i s i are the traditional intrinsic link i mass moments (Figure 3).

We applied the identification procedures of Section 4 to the data we sampled during the torque sensor offset calibration in [11]. We fixed joints that are to be stationary while another rotates, by applying a bias torque to push and hold these joints against the mechanical stops.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Gravity loading for all but the fastest robot motions dominates manipulator joint torque. For anthropomorphic-sized arms it has been shown that motions have to be completed in around a half second or less for inertial forces to be greater <ref> [6] </ref>. Even for fast motions, the use of a PD controller with gravity compensation apparently performs almost as well as a full feedforward controller that accommodates full inertial terms [1]. Figure 1 shows the block diagram for such a compensator.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, attempting to reduce or cancel inertia is known to be tricky [1], as instability easily results. We propose a simple method for gravity compensation, which is a natural extension of earlier work on torque sensor calibration <ref> [11] </ref>. This torque sensor calibration method is the only published method that can calibrate manipulator joint torque sensors "in vivo" (without disassembly). This method employs single-joint rotation and fitting of sinusoidal models to the torque versus position readings. <p> This procedure would be more automatic and substantially simpler than our initial procedure <ref> [11] </ref>, as the calibration mass is not required. Accurate values of the mass parameters are typically unknown even to the manufacturers and methods need to be developed to identify them. <p> approach may be considered to have a more principled method of pose selection and of determination of identifiable parameter combinations. 2 Notation and Background We assume that the manipulator kinematics are known (perhaps through an earlier kinematic calibration procedure) and that the joint torque and position sensors have been calibrated <ref> [11] </ref>. <p> Then i1 s i = R z ( i ) i s i (1) Similarly for other vectors. As will be seen, the z-component of i s i does not contribute to joint torque. Next we extract pertinent developments from <ref> [11] </ref>. The composite mass moment R i about joint i considers all links from i to the most distal link n to form one rigid body; hence it is configuration-dependent. <p> Begin at the last joint, and repeat Steps 1 to 4 below recursively from i = n to i = 1. Step 1: Sample joint torque and position sensor readings during static rotation of joint i. In our case, this process has been done in <ref> [11] </ref> when we cali brated torque sensor offsets. Step 2: Fit torque-position data to the sinusoidal model (4) and identify i N i from (6). Step 3: Compute i n i from (17). <p> Work has been done to calibrate both the kinematic model and the joint sensor parameters [5, 7]. We applied the identification procedures of Section 4 to the data we sampled during the torque sensor offset calibration in <ref> [11] </ref>. We fixed joints that are to be stationary while another rotates, by applying a bias torque to push and hold these joints against the mechanical stops. The identified parameters are given in Table 3 for the first 6 joints. <p> Instead, it identifies all components contributing to the gravity torque on one joint. The constant mass moment portion of a proximal link may contain components of the more distal links. The algorithm assumes that the robot joint torque and position sensors have previously been calibrated <ref> [11] </ref>. In our case, the experimental data is the same as from the torque sensor offset calibration; hence no new experiment is needed. In fact, one can argue that torque sensor calibration is an immediate prerequisite to gravity parameter determination, in order to achieve the most accurate results.

Reference-contexts: A straightforward way of identifying mass parameters separately is to follow inertia parameter estimation procedures, while setting all dynamic terms to zero. This procedure is employed by the manufacturer to implement GComp on the Sarcos Dextrous Arm <ref> [13] </ref>. Simultaneously multiple joint static rotation is required and care must be taken to choose the arm poses for better numerical accuracy. <p> Each joint is instrumented with high precision position and torque sensors, whose readings are accessible from the user level computer via a low level joint controller and mid level computer <ref> [13] </ref>. Work has been done to calibrate both the kinematic model and the joint sensor parameters [5, 7]. We applied the identification procedures of Section 4 to the data we sampled during the torque sensor offset calibration in [11].
