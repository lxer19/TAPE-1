Abstract: Corresponding to the linear program: we introduce two functions in the penalty parameter t &gt; 0 and the Lagrange relaxation parameter vector w, (t; ) are strictly convex C 1 functions with a common minimizer ^ w(t), which converges to an optimal Lagrange multiplier vector w fl associated with the constraint Ax = a as t ! 0, and enjoy the strong self-concordance property given by Nesterov and Nemirovsky. Based on these facts, we present conceptual algorithms with the use of Newton's method for tracing the trajectory f ^ w(t) : t &gt; 0g, and analyze their computational complexity.

Reference-contexts: Many studies ([1, 2, 12], etc.) have been done on how we exploit special structures such as generalized upper bounds, block diagonal structures and staircase structures in interior-point methods. The conceptual algorithms given in Section 6 has a close relation with a compact-inverse implementation (see Section 9 of <ref> [2] </ref>) of the primal-dual interior-point method applied to P fl and D fl . This is shown in Section 7 where we discuss some issues toward implementation of the horizontal and vertical decomposition techniques. 2. Notation. <p> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; = (13) where r = (A T w + B T y z c) and s = X 1=2 Z 1=2 (Xz te): This representation (13) of the solution (dx; dw; dy; dz) of (12) is called a compact-inverse implementation in the literature <ref> [2] </ref>. Hence if we utilize the compact-inverse implementation (13), the majority of the computation of (dx; dw; dy; dz) are also spent for (i) and (ii).
