Reference-contexts: We note one special case of this theorem. Let r true. Then s ) r trivially holds. The other conditions simplify to true 7! s in F and s stable in F [] G. These are known as conditions for "self-stabilization" to s; see <ref> [1] </ref>. Corollary: Suppose true 7! s in F and, s stable in F [] G Then every unless and leads-to property of F [] G is a property of F [] (G if s). 2

Reference-contexts: As shown in <ref> [2] </ref>, the proof can be redone if substitution axiom is taken into account.

Reference-contexts: It is not hard to see that ensures properties are preserved only under very stringent restrictions. Therefore, we will only consider unless and leads-to properties. The trails relation, introduced in <ref> [3] </ref>, is of central importance. Theorem: Suppose s trails r in F , i.e., s ) r in F; r 7! s in F; s unless :r in F . <p> unless (p ^ :q ^ :r) _ q in F , rewriting the rhs p ^ s unless q in F , p ^ :q ^ :r false from (5.1) 5.4 p ^ :q 7! s in F [] fi We use a slightly general form of the results in <ref> [3] </ref> to prove this result: T ) G:F P ; fG:F P is the fixedpoint predicate of Gg T unless r in H b 7! b 0 in H This general result can be proven in the same manner as the proof in [3]. <p> slightly general form of the results in <ref> [3] </ref> to prove this result: T ) G:F P ; fG:F P is the fixedpoint predicate of Gg T unless r in H b 7! b 0 in H This general result can be proven in the same manner as the proof in [3].

Reference-contexts: This question was first considered by Ambuj Singh <ref> [4] </ref>; the condition proposed here is simpler than the ones he proposed. This result is useful during program refinements. Suppose we have a program F [] ff where ff is a statement of the form, A if r.
