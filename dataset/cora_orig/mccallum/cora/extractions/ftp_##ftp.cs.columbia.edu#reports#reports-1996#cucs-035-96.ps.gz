Abstract: We study the complexity of 2mth order definite elliptic problems Lu = f (with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions) over a d-dimensional domain , error being measured in the H m ()- norm. The problem elements f belong to the unit ball of W r;p (), where p 2 [2; 1] and r &gt; d=p. Information consists of (possibly-adaptive) noisy evaluations of f or the coefficients of L. The absolute error in each noisy evaluation is at most ffi. We find that the nth minimal radius for this problem is proportional to n r=d + ffi, and that a noisy finite element method with quadrature (FEMQ), which uses only function values, and not derivatives, is a minimal error algorithm. This noisy FEMQ can be efficiently implemented using multigrid techniques. Using these results, we find tight bounds on the "-complexity (minimal cost of calculating an "-approximation) for this problem, said bounds depending on the cost c(ffi) of calculating a ffi-noisy information value. As an example, if the cost of a ffi-noisy evaluation is c(ffi) = ffi s (for s &gt; 0), then the complexity is proportional to (1=") d=r+s .

Reference-contexts: The Noisy FEMQ In this section, we define the noisy finite element method with quadrature (FEMQ). This is an algorithm using standard information consisting only of function evaluations, i.e., no derivative evaluations are used. Our notation is the standard one found in, e.g., <ref> [4] </ref> and [10, Chapter 5]. The easiest way to describe the noisy FEMQ is by following three steps. First, we describe the noise-free "pure" finite element method (FEM), which uses non-standard information. Next, we describe the noise-free FEMQ, which uses exact standard information. Finally, we describe the noisy FEMQ. <p> Using (4.3), we have J X j! j;K (D ff v)(b j;K )(D fi w)(b j;K )j = j det B K j j=1 Let D l denote the Frechet derivative, where l = jffj. As on <ref> [4, pg. 118] </ref>, there exists a subset fe ff 1 ; : : : ; e ff l g of the standard basis for R d such that for any x 2 K, we have (D ff v)(x) = (D l v)(x)(e ff 1 ; : : : ; e ff <p> fi ^w)( ^ b j )j J X j^! j j sup jffjm j (D ff ^v)( ^ b j )j 2 j=1 jfijm j (D fi ^w)( ^ b j )j 2 Ck^vk H m ( ^ K) k ^wk H m ( ^ K) where we have used <ref> [4, Theorem 3.1.2] </ref> in the last inequality above. <p> Hence there is a constant C, independent of ^v, such that J X j^! j ^v ( ^ b j )j Ck^vk L 2 ( ^ K) 8 ^v 2 P k ( ^ K): Applying this result to (5.5), using <ref> [4, Theorem 3.1.2] </ref> to estimate k^vk L 2 ( ^ K) in terms of kvk L 2 (K) , and using the quasi-uniformity of the sequence of triangulations, we see that there exists a constant C, independent of v, K, and n, such that J X j! j;K v (b j;K

Reference-contexts: The operator S is nonlinear. However, S ([f ; a]) depends nonlinearly only on a, i.e., for any fixed a, the operator S ([; a]) is a linear operator. Hence we may use the generalized Lax-Milgram Lemma ([1, pg. 112], <ref> [6, pg. 310] </ref>) to see that for any [f ; a] 2 F , there exists a unique solution u 2 H m 0 () to (2.2). Hence, the solution operator S is well-defined. We wish to calculate approximate solutions to this problem, using noisy standard information.
