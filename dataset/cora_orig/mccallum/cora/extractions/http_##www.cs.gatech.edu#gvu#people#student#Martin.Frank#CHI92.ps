Reference-contexts: Second, it f inds out which commands or command sequences would set these predicates by examining the postconditions. This search recursively extends over several levels through backchaining.This form of help has already been implemented in the framework of the User Interface Design Environment <ref> [1] </ref>, but has not been integrated with this tool so far. We will add a graphical front-end tool that can generate some of the typical pre and postconditions automatically . The tool will translate graphical connections between user interface objects into corresponding pre and postconditions.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Development of user interfaces has traditionally been a tedious process, especially constructing non-textual interfaces using a textual programming language. Interface builders were developed to interactively design user interfaces. The Developers Guide for the OPEN LOOK Graphical User Interface <ref> [3] </ref> is one of them. Like other builders, this tool is limited to specifying the appearance - not the functionality - of an interface.We have extended the Developer s Guide with a simple and powerful way to specify functionality. METHODOLOGY Pre and postconditions are associated with widgets (sliders, buttons, ...).
