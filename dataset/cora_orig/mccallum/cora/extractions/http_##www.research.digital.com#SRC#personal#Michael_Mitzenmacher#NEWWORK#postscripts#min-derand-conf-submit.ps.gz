Title: A Derandomization Using Min-Wise Independent Permutations Extended abstract for submission to Random '98 not for distribution  
Author: Andrei Z. Broder Moses Charikar Michael Mitzenmacher 
Abstract: Min-wise independence is a recently introduced notion of limited independence, similar in spirit to pairwise independence. The later has proven essential for the de-randomization of many algorithms. Here we show that approximate min-wise independence allows similar uses, by presenting a derandomization of the RNC algorithm for approximate set cover due to S. Rajagopalan and V. Vazirani. We also discuss how to derandomize their set multi-cover and multi-set multi-cover algorithms in restricted cases. The multi-cover case leads us to discuss the concept of k-minima-wise independence, a natural counterpart to k-wise independence.

Reference-contexts: Hence, by trying every hash function in the family one finds a cut with at least the expected number of crossing edges, jEj=2.

Unfortunately, the lower bounds proven in <ref> [4] </ref> show that no such family exists; any min-wise independent family would have size exponential in jLj.

Reference-contexts: Such families of small size exist, and can be easily constructed. Later on, pairwise independence and more generally k-wise independence have proven to be powerful algorithmic tools with significant theoretical and practical applications. (See the excellent survey by Luby and Wigderson <ref> [11] </ref> and references therein.) One important theoretical application of pairwise independence is the derandomization of algorithms. A well-known example is to find a large cut in a graph.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we demonstrate that the notion of min-wise independence can also prove useful for derandomization. Specifically, we use a polynomial-sized construction of approximate min-wise independent permutations due to Indyk to derandomize the parallel approximate set cover algorithm of Rajagopalan and Vazirani <ref> [12] </ref>. (From now on, called the RV-algorithm.) This example furthers our hope that min-wise independence may prove a generally useful concept. The paper proceeds as follows: in Section 2, we provide the definitions for min-wise and approximately min-wise independent families of permutations. We also state (without proof) Indyk's results. <p> The greedy algorithm yields an H n factor approximation. (H n denotes the harmonic number P 1in 1=i.) For more on the history of this problem, see <ref> [12] </ref> and references therein. <p> Hence we refer the interested reader to the proofs in <ref> [12] </ref>, and consider only the crux of the argument for the derandomization, namely the number of phases necessary for each iteration. As in [12], we establish an appropriate potential function , and show that its expected decrease in each phase is c for some constant c. <p> Hence we refer the interested reader to the proofs in <ref> [12] </ref>, and consider only the crux of the argument for the derandomization, namely the number of phases necessary for each iteration.

The potential function is such that if it ever becomes 0 we are done. In [12], this was used to show that O (log n) phases per round are sufficient, with high probability. <p> Lemma 3 E () (15*) Proof: As in <ref> [12] </ref>, we estimate the decrease in due to each pair (S; e) when e votes for S and S joins the cover. The associated decrease is deg (e) since decreases by one for every remaining set that contains e. <p> Given the results of <ref> [12] </ref>, we may conclude: 7 Theorem 1 The algorithm Parallel Set Cover can be derandomized to an N C 3 al-gorithm that approximates set cover within a factor of 16H n using a polynomial number of processors. <p> Then any bound on the probability of E that holds for random permutations also holds for any k-minima-wise independent family. Moreover, for any approximately k-minima-wise independent family, a suitable small correction to the bound holds. For example, many of the lemmata in <ref> [12] </ref> prove bounds for events assuming that the random permutations are generated by assigning each set a uniform random variable from [0; 1] and then sorting. <p> Hence given the results of <ref> [12] </ref>, the derandomizations follow with relatively little work. 6 Conclusion We have demonstrated a novel derandomization using the explicit construction of approximate min-wise independent families of permutations of polynomial size. We expect that this technique may prove useful for further derandomizations.
