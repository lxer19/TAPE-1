Abstract: In this paper we prove that rational functions can be reconstructed using a polynomial number of black box evaluations. We consider two models: oracles with exact computations and modular oracles depending on the sizes of coefficients.

Reference-contexts: Previously known result [4] required (t nt log d) O (1) black box evaluations and arithmetical operations. We consider also the modular black box oracle which computes for different primes p the reductions modp of values of f in prescribed points, c.f. <ref> [1] </ref>. Let the length of numerators and denominators of rational coefficients of f in some t-sparse representation of f be less than M and d be an upper bound for the degree of the numerator and denominator of f in this representation. <p> We suggest an algorithm which using this oracle constructs the coefficients and exponents from a t-sparse representation of f within the time polynomial in t t ; M; n; log d using the polynomial in t; M; n; log d number of black box evaluations. The last model, c.f. <ref> [1] </ref>, affords to avoid the difficulties arising in other models considered earlier [5], [6], [7] and consisting in the fact that the exact rational values of sparse rational functions even in small integer points like 2; 3 : : : have exponential length in the size of input.

Reference-contexts: We are interested in the isolated solutions of (28). The length of coefficients of equations in (28) is polynomial in t; M; n; log d. Apply the algorithm from [10] (c.f. also <ref> [2] </ref> where the case of general fields of coefficients is treated in details) and construct a finite set A (l i ; o 1 ; o 2 ) of solutions of (28) such that for every connected component C of the variety of solutions of system (28) there exists ! 2

Reference-contexts: The algorithm is described. CORRECTNESS OF THE ALGORITHM Note that for every positive pairwise different x 1 ; : : : ; x m any minor of the Vandermond matrix (x j is different from zero, see e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>. It follows from here that the number of zeros of the denominator of f in the set fp i : 1 i 2t 1 t 2 + 2t 2 2g is no more than t 2 1. So #S 2t 1 t 2 + t 2 1.

Reference-contexts: Herewith each evaluation of the logarithm requires O (n log d) arithmetical operations where d is an upper bound for the degree of the numerator and denominator of f. Previously known result <ref> [4] </ref> required (t nt log d) O (1) black box evaluations and arithmetical operations. We consider also the modular black box oracle which computes for different primes p the reductions modp of values of f in prescribed points, c.f. [1]. <p> We call this representation uniquely defined by its exponents if it uniquely defined by the sets of exponents A; B, see Section 1 and Section 2 for the case of many variables. Each representation of the rational function f which is minimally (t 1 ; t 2 )-sparse, see <ref> [4] </ref>, is uniquely defined by its exponents. Factually we construct in our algorithms all the (t 1 ; t 2 )-sparse representations of f uniquely defined by their exponents for maxft 1 ; t 2 g t. <p> They correspond to the isolated solutions of some systems of algebraic equations and inequalities over the field of real numbers. Our reduction from multivariable case to one variable is easier for (t 1 ; t 2 )-sparse representations uniquely defined by their exponents than the reduction of <ref> [4] </ref> for representation which are minimally (t 1 ; t 2 )-sparse. Complexity issues for t-sparse polynomial and rational functions have been dealt in several papers. We refer for the bibliography to [4]. <p> easier for (t 1 ; t 2 )-sparse representations uniquely defined by their exponents than the reduction of <ref> [4] </ref> for representation which are minimally (t 1 ; t 2 )-sparse. Complexity issues for t-sparse polynomial and rational functions have been dealt in several papers. We refer for the bibliography to [4]. <p> The rational function f 2 Q (X) is called (t 1 ; t 2 )-sparse, c.f. <ref> [4] </ref>, if it is represented in a form f = 1it 1 a i X ff i P (1) where a i ; b j 2 Q; ff i ; fi j 2 Z, b j 6= 0 for all i; j and ff i 1 6= ff i 2 , <p> The (t 1 ; t 2 )-sparse representation (1) of f is called minimal <ref> [4] </ref> if there exists no (t 1 1; t 2 )-sparse or (t 1 ; t 2 1)-sparse representation of f. Note that if (1) is minimal then it is uniquely defined by its exponents. <p> Similarly the rational functions f and f 1 = ( 1io 1 X d j X ffi j ) from the description of the algorithm are defined and coincide in at least 2t 1 t 2 points of S and therefore coincide identically, see Corollary 4 from <ref> [4] </ref>. Now we need only the following two lemmas. LEMMA 1 Let representation (3) of the rational function f be uniquely defined by its exponents. Consider system of equations and inequalities (4) Denote by W the variety of all the real solutions of this system. <p> The theorem is proved. REMARK 1 Note that for every representation (3) from Theorem 1 it is fulfilled max ffl i ; ffi j g &lt; 2d (2t 1) since, otherwise, (3) is not uniquely defined by its exponents, c.f.

Lemma 3 (c) from <ref> [4] </ref>. Set D = 8d (2t 1) + 1. Applying Lemma 3 and the algorithm from Theorem 1 to the rational function in one variable f from Lemma 3 we get the required representations of f.
