Abstract: Robotic soccer is a challenging research domain which involves multiple agents that need to collaborate in an adversarial environment to achieve specific objectives. In this paper, we describe CMU-nited, the team of small robotic agents that we developed to enter the RoboCup-97 competition. We designed and built the robotic agents, devised the appropriate vision algorithm, and developed and implemented algorithms for strategic collaboration between the robots in an uncertain and dynamic environment. The robots can organize themselves in formations, hold specific roles, and pursue their goals. In game situations, they have demonstrated their collaborative behaviors on multiple occasions. The robots can also switch roles to maximize the overall performance of the team. We present an overview of the vision processing algorithm which successfully tracks multiple moving objects and predicts trajectories. The paper then focusses on the agent behaviors ranging from low-level individual behaviors to coordinated, strategic team behaviors. CMUnited won the RoboCup-97 small-robot competition at IJCAI-97 in

Reference-contexts: Systems with on-board and off-board types have appeared in recent years. All have found that the reactiveness of soccer robots requires a vision system with a high processing cycle time. However, due to the rich visual input, researchers have found that dedicated processors or even DSPs are often needed <ref> [2, 12] </ref>. We currently use a frame-grabber with frame-rate transfer from a 3CCD camera.

Reference-contexts: We introduced a failure recovery routine to handle such failures. The navigational movement control for our robots is hence done via reactive control. The control rules described below are inspired by the Braitenburg vehicle <ref> [3] </ref>. The Braitenburg love vehicle defines a reactive control mechanism that directs a differential-drive robot to a certain target. A similar behavior is required in the system; however, the love vehicle's control mechanism is too simplistic and, in some start configurations, tends to converge to the goal very slowly.

Reference-contexts: All of these skills must be executed while avoiding obstacles such as the walls and other robots. Non-holonomic path generation The non-holonomic path planning problem has been addressed by many researchers, e.g., <ref> [8, 4] </ref>. However, most of the algorithms deal with static worlds and generate pre-planned global paths. In the robot soccer domain, this is not possible as the domain is inherently dynamic and response times need to be very high.

Reference-contexts: Like for real soccer players, it is often essential for robots to predict future locations of the ball (or of the other players). We have used an Extended Kalman-Bucy filter (EKF) <ref> [5] </ref> for ball movement prediction. The EKF is a recursive estimator for a possibly non-linear system. It involves a two-step iterative process, namely update and propagate. The current best estimate of the system's state and its error covariance is computed on each iteration.

Reference-contexts: One of the advantages of Robotic Soccer is that it enables the direct comparison of different systems: they can be matched against each other in competitions. In particular, the system described here was designed specifically for RoboCup97 in which several robotic teams competed on an "even playing field." <ref> [6] </ref>. The scientific opportunities involved in this effort are enormous. Our particular scientific focus is on multiagent systems coupled with collaborative and adversarial learning in an environment that requires real-time dynamic planning. This paper describes the overall architecture of our robotic soccer system.

Reference-contexts: These high-level, multiagent behaviors were originally developed in simulation and then transferred over to the robot-control code. Only the run-time passing evaluation function was redefined. Further details, particularly about the flexible team structures, are available in <ref> [14] </ref>. Positions, Formations, and Active Modes Positions are defined as flexible regions within which the player attempts to move towards the ball. <p> On the other hand, if winning, they might choose a defensive formation. The precise conditions for switching positions and formations are decided upon in advance, in what we call a "locker-room agreement," <ref> [14] </ref> in order to eliminate the need for complex on-line negotiation protocols. Although the default action of each robot is to go to its position and face the ball, there are three active modes from which the robot must choose.
