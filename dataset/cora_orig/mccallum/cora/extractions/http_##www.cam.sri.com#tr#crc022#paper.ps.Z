Abstract: Aspects of semantic interpretation, such as quantifier scoping and reference resolution, are often realised computationally by non-monotonic operations involving loss of information and destructive manipulation of semantic representations. The paper describes how monotonic reference resolution and scoping can be carried out using a revised Quasi Logical Form (QLF) representation. Semantics for QLF are presented in which the denotations of formulas are extended monotonically as QLF expressions are resolved.

Reference-contexts: As before, underspecified QLFs are produced on the basis of a unification grammar. Previously, QLF resolution was only partially monotonic; full monotonicity required changes to the original QLF formalism and the resolution and scoping processes. These changes have been implemented in a further development of the Core Language Engine <ref> (Alshawi 1992) </ref>, although we will ignore most implementation issues in the present paper. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the syntax of the QLF language and Section 3 gives some illustrative examples of monotonic QLF resolution. Sections 4 and 5 present the semantics of the QLF formalism.

Reference-contexts: By contrast, aspects of semantic interpretation, such as reference and quantifier scope resolution, are often realised by non-monotonic operations involving loss of information and destructive manipulation of semantic representations. A `two-level' approach to semantic interpretation tends to result <ref> (Bronneberg et al. 1980) </ref>, where an initial, underspecified representation is transformed into a separate, specified, representation.

Reference-contexts: As with Lewin's scoping algorithm, <ref> (Lewin 1990) </ref>, there are no constraints built explicitly into the QLF semantics on where a quantification rule for a term may be applied, or indeed on the number of times it may be applied.

Reference-contexts: The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the syntax of the QLF language and Section 3 gives some illustrative examples of monotonic QLF resolution. Sections 4 and 5 present the semantics of the QLF formalism. Section 6 discusses the relationship between monotonic interpretation, Pereira's categorial semantics <ref> (Pereira 1990) </ref>, and context change approaches to semantics. Section 7 mentions some benefits of using QLF-like representations in implementing natural language systems. 2. <p> RELATED APPROACHES Viewed from a slightly different perspective, monotonic interpretation has a number of points of contact with Pereira's categorial semantics <ref> (Pereira 1990) </ref>. Put briefly, in categorial semantics, semantic evaluation is represented as deduction in a functional calculus that derives the meanings of sentences from the meanings of their parts.

Reference-contexts: Preference ranking over alternative resolutions facilitates automatic disambiguation of input. Interactive disambiguation can make use of generation from resolved QLFs for confirmation by a user. Generation: There is a strong connection between monotonicity and reversibility in language processing systems. Monotonicity of unification means that algorithms such as head-driven generation <ref> (Shieber et al 1990) </ref> can be applied to grammars developed for analysis.
