Reference-contexts: All of these approaches suffer from the need for implicit or explicit enumeration of all paths between origin-destination pairs in the network. Other methods based on nonlinear complementarity (Aashanti and Magnanti, 1981) and optimization <ref> (Beckmann et al., 1956) </ref> have also been suggested. This paper illustrates how the complementarity and optimization approaches to the static traffic equilibrium problem can be implemented using standard modeling software.

Reference-contexts: In the past, a range of solution methods have been proposed for the Wardropian model. Some of the earlier techniques include multipath assignment (Irwin et al. 1961) and variational inequality methods <ref> (Bertsekas and Gafni 1982) </ref>. More recently, a tatonnement adjustment process has been suggested (Friesz, Bernstein, Mehta, Tobin and Ganjalizadeh 1994). All of these approaches suffer from the need for implicit or explicit enumeration of all paths between origin-destination pairs in the network.

For the purposes of this paper, we confine our attention to the Sioux Falls network that appeared in (Friesz et al. 1994).

The resulting equilibrium problem (4) has dimension 2376, using the first relationship of (4) to eliminate the variables v.
