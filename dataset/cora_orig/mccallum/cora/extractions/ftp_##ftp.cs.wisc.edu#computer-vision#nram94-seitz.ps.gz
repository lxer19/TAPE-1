Abstract: Real cyclic motions tend not to be perfectly even, i.e., the period varies slightly from one cycle to the next, because of physically important changes in the scene. A generalization of period is defined for cyclic motions that makes periodic variation explicit. This representation, called the period trace, is compact and purely temporal, describing the evolution of an object or scene without reference to spatial quantities such as position or velocity. By delimiting cycles and identifying correspondences across cycles, the period trace provides a means of temporally registering a cyclic motion. In addition, several purely temporal motion features are derived, relating to the nature and location of irregularities. Results are presented using real image sequences and applications to athletic and medical motion analysis are discussed.

Reference-contexts: Define the measurement matrix M s;t of C as the concatenation of C (s) and C (t): M s;t = C (s) The measurement matrix can be registered to eliminate effects due to translation by subtracting each row's centroid from each element in the row <ref> [2] </ref>. Denote the registered measurement matrix as ^ M s;t . If 4 is the fourth singular value of ^ M (s; t), it can be shown [12] that d A (C (s); C (t)) = 2 n is a view-invariant match function.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, if an a priori motion model is available, e.g., linear or piecewise constant, the model can ameliorate the task of deriving t n by reducing the search space and making the recovery procedure less sensitive to noise. Existing techniques for recover ing periodicity information <ref> [7, 8, 9] </ref> implicitly use this 4 strategy, exploiting the assumption of a constant pe-riod. <p> The problem is ameliorated with a match function that is invariant to changes in viewpoint. We introduced such a function in previous work <ref> [7] </ref>, that equates two images if and only if they represent two views of the same object, under an affine projection model. Accordingly, consider a motion representation consisting of the projected trajectories of n points on an object or in a scene.
