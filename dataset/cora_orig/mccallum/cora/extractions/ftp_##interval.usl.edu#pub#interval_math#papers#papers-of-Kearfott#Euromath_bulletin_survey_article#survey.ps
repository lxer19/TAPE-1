Reference-contexts: If such operations are composed, bounds on the ranges of real functions can be obtained. For example, if then f (<ref> [0; 1] </ref>) = [0; 1] [0; 1] 1 = [0; 1][1; 0] = [1; 0]; which contains the exact range [1=4; 0]. (This is necessarily so.) Such bounds on ranges can be used throughout mathematical computations in place of Lipschitz constants. <p> If such operations are composed, bounds on the ranges of real functions can be obtained. For example, if then f (<ref> [0; 1] </ref>) = [0; 1] [0; 1] 1 = [0; 1][1; 0] = [1; 0]; which contains the exact range [1=4; 0]. (This is necessarily so.)

Such bounds on ranges can be used throughout mathematical computations in place of Lipschitz constants. <p> If such operations are composed, bounds on the ranges of real functions can be obtained.

Such bounds on ranges can be used throughout mathematical computations in place of Lipschitz constants. In fact, bounds from interval arithmetic often are sharper, and are simpler to derive than bounds from other techniques. <p> For example, if f is as in Equation (7), then the mean value theorem gives f (x) 2 f (0:5) + f 0 (~)(x 0:5) for some unknown ~ between 0:5 and x. If x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, then ~ may be replaced by the interval [0; 1] to obtain f 0 (~) 2 2 [0; 1] 1 = [1; 1]. <p> For example, if f is as in Equation (7), then the mean value theorem gives f (x) 2 f (0:5) + f 0 (~)(x 0:5) for some unknown ~ between 0:5 and x. If x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, then ~ may be replaced by the interval [0; 1] to obtain f 0 (~) 2 2 [0; 1] 1 = [1; 1]. <p> If x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, then ~ may be replaced by the interval [0; 1] to obtain f 0 (~) 2 2 [0; 1] 1 = [1; 1]. This leads to a second set of bounds on the range of f : f (x) 2 0:25 + [1; 1][0:5; 0:5] = [0:75; 0:25] The power of interval arithmetic lies in its implementation on computers. <p> If x 2 [0; 1], then ~ may be replaced by the interval [0; 1] to obtain f 0 (~) 2 2 [0; 1] 1 = <ref> [1; 1] </ref>.

In particular, outwardly rounded interval arithmetic allows rigorous enclosures for the ranges of operations and functions. <p> The sets of theory and tools are too extensive to be fully described here.

Reference-contexts: 1 What is Interval Arithmetic, and Why is it Considered? Interval arithmetic is an arithmetic defined on sets of intervals, rather than sets of real numbers. A form of interval arithmetic perhaps first appeared in 1924 and 1931 in <ref> [8, 104] </ref>, then later in [98]. Modern development of interval arithmetic began with R. E. Moore's dissertation [64]. Since then, thousands of research articles and numerous books have appeared on the subject. Periodic conferences, as well as special meetings, are held on the subject.

Reference-contexts: Maekawa [61] uses interval-based techniques to robustly solve shape interrogation problems in computational geometry; such solutions are important in automated manufacturing of free-form objects. Others, such as [43, 89, 93], have also shown success in this area. In a somewhat different application, Enger <ref> [17] </ref> has shown how to use interval ray tracing to greatly speed up ray tracing algorithms without sacrificing image quality. The basic idea is to take care of regions in the image having nearly constant intensity with a single interval ray, rather than with many point rays.

Reference-contexts: Unique to interval systems is the necessity to rigorously bound the discretization error, so any 8 computational proofs will apply to the original system of differential equations, not just its discretization. Nonetheless, the discretization error can be taken into account.

Reference-contexts: The technique involves explicitly using the interrelationships among intermediate quantities in evaluation of algebraic expressions in nonlinear systems, objective functions, and constraints. The associated iteration processes seem to have been rediscovered several times <ref> [4, 9, 14, 38] </ref>. 3.3 Quadrature Adaptive quadrature is another area in which interval methods have much to offer. This is because, due to the form of the error term, meaningful interval enclosures for the actual integral can easily be computed.

(Note: The derivative enclosure f 0 (x) may be replaced by a slope enclosure; see <ref> [40] </ref> or [73] for further information and references.) Applying the Brouwer fixed point theorem in the context of the univariate interval Newton method leads to: Theorem 2 If N (f ; x; x) x, then there exists a unique solution of f (x) = 0 in x. <p> Existence in Theorem 2 follows from Miranda's theorem, a corollary of the Brouwer fixed point theorem. For details and references, see <ref> [40] </ref> or [73].

Reference-contexts: If the algorithm does not take account of the wrapping effect, the overestimation in the solution increases exponentially from time step to time step. The wrapping effect can be ameliorated with changes of variables and other techniques, as in Lohner's software AWA <ref> [59, 60] </ref>. (Also see [74] for a survey and a novel technique.)

(Note: The derivative enclosure f 0 (x) may be replaced by a slope enclosure; see [40] or <ref> [73] </ref> for further information and references.) Applying the Brouwer fixed point theorem in the context of the univariate interval Newton method leads to: Theorem 2 If N (f ; x; x) x, then there exists a unique solution of f (x) = 0 in x. <p> Existence in Theorem 2 follows from Miranda's theorem, a corollary of the Brouwer fixed point theorem. For details and references, see [40] or <ref> [73] </ref>. Uniqueness is as follows: Suppose there were two solutions x 2 x and ~x 2 x. Then f (x) = 0 = f (~x), so there is a ~ 2 x with f (x) = f (~x) + f 0 (~)(x ~x) = f 0 (~)(x ~x) = 0. <p> This computational existence-uniqueness theory has wide use, from constructing narrow bounds around approximate solutions to linear systems, within which an actual solution must lie, to proving existence and uniqueness of solutions to operator equations.

Reference-contexts: Early, Mudur and Koparkar [69] provide a review of interval analysis techniques that can be useful in computational geometry. Maekawa [61] uses interval-based techniques to robustly solve shape interrogation problems in computational geometry; such solutions are important in automated manufacturing of free-form objects. Others, such as <ref> [43, 89, 93] </ref>, have also shown success in this area. In a somewhat different application, Enger [17] has shown how to use interval ray tracing to greatly speed up ray tracing algorithms without sacrificing image quality.

Reference-contexts: The basic idea is to take care of regions in the image having nearly constant intensity with a single interval ray, rather than with many point rays. Snyder <ref> [94] </ref> has provided a relatively recent overview of applications of interval computations to computer graphics. 4.3 Electrical Engineering Okumura [76] shows that an interval method, besides providing validated results, is hundreds of times faster than a Monte Carlo method for solving AC network equations.

Reference-contexts: Neumaier and Rage [75, 82] use interval computations to verify that chaotic behavior occurs in a molecular model. Spreuer and Adams <ref> [95] </ref> use Lohner's ODE software (see x3.4) to verify existence of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits of the origin for the Lorenz equations.

Reference-contexts: This makes a qualitative difference in scientific computations, since the results are now intervals in which the exact result must lie. It also enables use of computations for automated theorem proving. 2 Directed rounding proceeds as follows. Much modern computing equip-ment (including machines that support IEEE standard arithmetic <ref> [96] </ref>, such as most PC's and workstations) allows the result of an arithmetic operation to be rounded down to the nearest machine number less than the mathematically correct result, rounded up to the nearest machine number greater than or equal to the mathematically correct result, or rounded to the machine number
