Title: A Formal Approach to Fuzzy Modeling

Keyword: Fuzzy modeling, function approximation, dynamical systems.

Abstract: A formalism for coding fuzzy models of dynamical systems is presented. It is shown that the formalism is rich enough to capture the performance of arbitrary conventional discrete time dynamical systems, whose transition maps are polynomials with rational coefficients. The proof of this fact provides a constructive algorithm for generating fuzzy models to approximate an arbitrary map on a compact set arbitrarily closely. Our modeling formalism highlights the similarities between fuzzy systems and hybrid control systems. We hope to be able to exploit these similarities by extending results from the area of hybrid systems to the fuzzy domain and vice versa.

Reference-contexts: The following system can be used to illustrate the point: x k+1 = f (x k ) = cos (5x k ) (11) Here cosine is viewed as a map cos : <ref> [1; 1] </ref> ! [1; 1].

A comparison of the trajectories of the two systems when simulated together is shown in Figure 6. The value * = 10 16 was used in the simulation. Clearly the trajectories of the two systems quickly diverge, even for this very small approximation error.

We assume that all states and the input will lie in the interval <ref> [5; 5] </ref>. Following the procedure of Section III, we partition all states and inputs to fuzzy sets of the form shown in Figure 4. The coding of the rules can be done algebraically.

Reference-contexts: Here k:k denotes any complete norm on R N . Note that for Corollary 1 to hold we need to strengthen our requirement on U from bounded to compact. To prove the corollary we just need to note that, as a consequence of the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem <ref> [17] </ref>, we can approximate the map f arbitrarily closely by a polynomial with rational coefficients. Then we can duplicate this polynomial by a fuzzy system as described by Theorem 1. This corollary is well known and its proof can also be found in [9].
