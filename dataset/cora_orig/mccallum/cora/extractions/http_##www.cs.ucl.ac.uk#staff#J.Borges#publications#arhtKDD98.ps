Title: Mining Association Rules in Hypertext Databases

Abstract: In this work we propose a generalisation of the notion of association rule in the context of flat transactions to that of a composite association rule in the context of a structured directed graph, such as the world-wide-web. The techniques proposed aim at finding patterns in the user behaviour when traversing such a hypertext system. We redefine the concepts of confidence and support for composite association rules, and two algorithms to mine such rules are proposed. Extensive experiments with random data were conducted and the results show that, in spite of the worst-case complexity analysis which indicates exponential be-haviour, in practice the algorithms' complexity, measured in the number of iterations performed, is linear in the number of nodes traversed.

Reference-contexts: Several data mining techniques have been being studied and among them is the problem of mining association rules in large datasets of flat transactions. The problem was introduced in (Agrawal, Imielinski, & Swami 1993), and has been being intensively studied since then, see for example <ref> (Agrawal et al. 1996) </ref>. The standard example aims to find in a large dataset of supermarket sales transactions rules such as "90% of the customers that purchase milk also buy bread".

Reference-contexts: We will now extend the preceding concepts to the general case of rules with any number of links. The concept of trail plays an important role in our search for patterns on the user behaviour; following is the def-inition of trail according to <ref> (Buckley & Harary 1990) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: All rights reserved. the design of the underlying hypertext system accordingly. This idea was first suggested in <ref> (Chen, Park, & Yu 1996) </ref> wherein a method is proposed to mine access patterns in a web-like environment. The user navigation information is obtained from server log data that is converted into a set of maximal forward references and two algorithms are devised to mine the large reference sequences. <p> We propose the generalisation of the concept of association rule rather than pre-processing the server data into a form which is then amenable to analysis by the standard association rule algorithms as in <ref> (Chen, Park, & Yu 1996) </ref>. The semantics of the user's navigation are maintained thus alleviating the danger for over evaluating references when the input is converted to standard association rule form. <p> Related Work Techniques for mining association rules between items in large data sets have been an active topic of research since (Agrawal, Imielinski, & Swami 1993). In <ref> (Chen, Park, & Yu 1996) </ref> the idea of applying these techniques to the problem of mining user access patterns in a web environment was introduced.

Reference-contexts: We formalise the notion of composite association rule, confidence and support in the context of a directed graph such as the WWW, or more generally a hypertext system <ref> (Nielsen 1990) </ref>. Two algorithms are proposed: one is a modification of the directed graph Depth-First-Search algorithm, and the other uses an incremental approach to build the set of composite rules of size n + 1 from the set of composite rules of size n.

Reference-contexts: The work by Yan et al. in (Yan et al. 1996) proposes a clustering technique to automatically classify visitors of a web site according to their access patterns, and a method for dynamic link suggestion based on the obtained categories. In <ref> (Shahabi et al. 1997) </ref> the authors propose a profiler to keep record of the user navigation session and in (Zarkesh et al. 1997) an algorithm that clusters into classes the users that navigate with similar interests and checks the probability of a new user will become a member of each class.

Reference-contexts: For example, a link from the root to one of its child nodes will appear in all forward references passing through that child, enlarging its support, while this link may have only been traversed once.
