Abstract: We consider two merit functions which can be used for solving the nonlinear complementarity problem via nonnegatively constrained minimization. One of the functions is the restricted implicit Lagrangian [8, 20, 25], and the other appears to be new. We study the conditions under which a stationary point of the minimization problem is guaranteed to be a solution of the underlying complementarity problem. It appears that for both formulations, the same regularity condition is needed. This condition is closely related to the one used in [4] for unrestricted implicit Lagrangian. Some new sufficient conditions are also given. fl This material is based on research supported in part by CNPq grant number 300734/95-6. y Instituto de Matematica Pura e Aplicada, Estrada Dona Castorina 110, Jardim Bot^anico, Rio de Janeiro, RJ 22460-320, Brazil.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The classical nonlinear complementarity problem <ref> [1, 22] </ref>, NCP (F ), is to find a point x 2 &lt; n such that x 0; F (x) 0; hx; F (x)i = 0; (1.1) where F : &lt; n ! &lt; n is a continuously differentiable function, and h; i denotes the usual inner product.

Reference-contexts: We assume that the solution set S of (1.1) is nonempty. In the case when F () is affine, NCP (F ) reduces to the linear complementarity problem <ref> [2] </ref>. A popular approach to solving NCP (F ) is to construct a merit function f () such that solutions of (1.1) are related in a certain way to the optimal set of the problem of minimizing f () over some set C. <p> Clearly, the class of P -matrices is contained in the class of P 0 matrices and the class of strictly semimonotone matrices. Also P 0 and strictly semimonotone matrices are subclasses of P + 0 -matrices. We refer the reader to <ref> [2] </ref> for a detailed discussion. 2 Preliminary Results We start with some preliminary results. Lemma 2.1 Let j 2 f1; 2g. <p> := fi j x i 0; F i (x) 0; x i F i (x) = 0g; N := fi j x i 0; F i (x) &lt; 0g: We remind that the matrix rF (x) &gt; is said to reverse the sign of a vector z 2 &lt; n <ref> [2] </ref> if z i [rF (x) &gt; z] i 0 8i 2 f1; : : : ; ng: (3.2) Definition 3.1 states that a point x 2 &lt; n + is regular if the only vector z 2 &lt; n satisfying both (3.1) and (3.2) is the zero vector. <p> Also, it has a clear connection to one of the characterizations of P -matrices (recall that a P -matrix reverses the sign of no nonzero vector <ref> [2] </ref>). Thus if rF (x) is a P -matrix then the regularity condition is satisfied automatically. Lemma 3.1 For j 2 f1; 2g and x 2 &lt; n + , Definitions 3.1 and 3.2 are equivalent. Proof. <p> If rF (x) is a P-matrix then x solves NCP (F ). 2. If x is feasible (i.e. F (x) 0) and rF (x) is strictly semimonotone then x solves NCP (F ). Proof. The first assertion follows immediately from Definition 3.1 and characterization of P-matrices <ref> [2] </ref>. The second assertion can be proven the same way as in [4]. We now give a new sufficient condition for the function f 2 (). Corollary 3.2 Let x be a KKT point of (1.4) for j = 2. Then the following properties hold. 1.

Reference-contexts: Here we give a more general regularity condition which is both necessary and sufficient and applies to either of the two reformulations (see Section 3). Our analysis is motivated by <ref> [4] </ref> where stationary points of the (unrestricted) implicit Lagrangian f 3 () (introduced in [20], and further studied and extended in [17, 27, 13, 11, 24, 26, 28]) are considered : f 3 (x) := i=1 with 3 (a; b) := ab + 2ff (a ffb) 2 + b 2 : <p> stationary points of the (unrestricted) implicit Lagrangian f 3 () (introduced in [20], and further studied and extended in [17, 27, 13, 11, 24, 26, 28]) are considered : f 3 (x) := i=1 with 3 (a; b) := ab + 2ff (a ffb) 2 + b 2 : In <ref> [4] </ref>, regularity conditions for both the unconstrained and nonnegatively constrained cases are given. However, the restricted implicit Lagrangian (1.2) is a more natural choice for the 2 nonnegatively constrained optimization; we will therefore consider this function. <p> Curiously, it turns out that f 1 () and f 2 () require the same regularity condition (see Definition 3.1) for a KKT point of (1.4) to solve NCP (F ). Furthermore, this condition appears to be closely related to the one used in <ref> [4] </ref> for f 3 (). However, the regularity condition employed here is, in a sense, independent of the merit function (in [4], it is tied to 3 (; )). A few words about our notation. For a real-valued matrix A of any dimension, A &gt; denotes its transpose. <p> Furthermore, this condition appears to be closely related to the one used in <ref> [4] </ref> for f 3 (). However, the regularity condition employed here is, in a sense, independent of the merit function (in [4], it is tied to 3 (; )). A few words about our notation. For a real-valued matrix A of any dimension, A &gt; denotes its transpose. For a differentiable function f : &lt; n ! &lt;, rf will denote the n-dimensional vector of partial derivatives with respect to x. <p> However, in this paper, we focus on the study of stationary points. 6 3 Regularity Conditions We now give a definition of a regular point which does not explicitly depend on the merit function used. Conditions of this type for various merit functions have been employed in <ref> [23, 21, 5, 16, 4, 18] </ref>. <p> We note that in <ref> [4] </ref> the following definition of a regular point was used (in connection with the implicit Lagrangian, i.e. for j = 3). <p> We now state our main result. The proof is similar to the one in <ref> [4] </ref>. 8 Theorem 3.1 Let j 2 f1; 2g, and x 2 &lt; n be a KKT point of the problem min f j (x): Then x solves NCP (F ) if and only if x is regular. Proof. <p> If x is feasible (i.e. F (x) 0) and rF (x) is strictly semimonotone then x solves NCP (F ). Proof.

Reference-contexts: Hence x must be a solution of NCP (F ). 9 Remark 3.1 We note that in <ref> [7] </ref> a different constrained optimization reformulation of an NCP is considered.

In the case when ff = 1, it is equivalent to the merit function introduced in <ref> [8] </ref> for general variational inequality problems. It is known that f 1 () is nonnegative on &lt; n + and assumes the value 1 of zero precisely at the solutions of NCP (F ). Moreover, f 1 () is continuously differentiable whenever F () is (see [8, 20]). <p> It is known that f 1 () is nonnegative on &lt; n + and assumes the value 1 of zero precisely at the solutions of NCP (F ).

In <ref> [8, 25] </ref> it was shown (for f 1 ()) that, if x is a KKT point of the minimization problem and rF (x) is positive definite, then x is indeed a solution of NCP (F ). <p> Proof.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The classical nonlinear complementarity problem <ref> [1, 22] </ref>, NCP (F ), is to find a point x 2 &lt; n such that x 0; F (x) 0; hx; F (x)i = 0; (1.1) where F : &lt; n ! &lt; n is a continuously differentiable function, and h; i denotes the usual inner product.

Reference-contexts: Papers developing this approach include [20, 13, 10, 18, 15, 21, 26]. In the second case, nonnegatively constrained problems have to be solved. Work in this direction can be found in [8, 20]. Yet other approaches are nonsmooth and semismooth methods <ref> [5, 6, 16, 3, 23, 12] </ref>. A recent survey of merit functions and related issues can be found in [9]. While reformulating the problem, it is often desirable to preserve the smoothness of F () and the dimensionality n of the variables space. <p> However, in this paper, we focus on the study of stationary points. 6 3 Regularity Conditions We now give a definition of a regular point which does not explicitly depend on the merit function used. Conditions of this type for various merit functions have been employed in <ref> [23, 21, 5, 16, 4, 18] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we shall consider only some nonnegatively constrained smooth reformulations. It is known that NCP (F ) can be cast as a problem of minimizing the following restricted implicit Lagrangian function f 1 () <ref> [8, 20, 25] </ref> over the nonnegative orthant &lt; n + : n X 1 (x i ; F i (x)); where 1 : &lt; 2 ! &lt; is given by 1 (a; b) := ab + 2ff (a ffb) 2 with ff &gt; 0 being a parameter and () + denoting <p> Because, in general, most optimization techniques are only guaranteed to find a stationary (Karush-Kuhn-Tucker [19], or KKT for short) point of (1.4), the question arises as to when such a point is a solution of the underlying complementarity problem. In <ref> [8, 25] </ref> it was shown (for f 1 ()) that, if x is a KKT point of the minimization problem and rF (x) is positive definite, then x is indeed a solution of NCP (F ).
