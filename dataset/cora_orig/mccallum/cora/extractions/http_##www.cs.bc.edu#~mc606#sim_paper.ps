Abstract: The field of parallel discrete event simulation is entering a period of self-assessment. Fifteen years of investigation has witnessed great strides in techniques for efficiently executing discrete event simulations on parallel and distributed machines. Still, the discrete event simulation community at large has failed to recognize many of these results. The central question is, why has this occurred? One possible reason is an apparent disagreement in both the focus and objectives of the parallel discrete event simulation research community (primarily computer scientists) and the discrete event simulation community (a widely diverse group including, operations researchers, management scientists, mathematicians, and statisticians, as well as computer scientists). An examination of parallel discrete event simulation from a modeling methodological perspective illustrates some of these differences and reveals potentials for their resolution.

Reference-contexts: These conceptual bridges are not a panacea, however; the tendency to use the language best known by the modeler often results in a contrived fitting of the natural model description into the form provided by the simulation programming language. An important result from <ref> (Derrick 1988) </ref> is the identification of the need to select a conceptual framework suitable for a particular model and a given set of objectives. 4.2 Do Extant PDES Paradigms Permit Natural Model Descriptions? Unfortunately, the importance and role of the conceptual framework within the model development process has had little recognition

Reference-contexts: Clearly, any requisite perspective is counter to precepts of conceptual framework selection, and further, would seem to violate a fundamental principle of software development the principle of separation of concerns advanced by Edsger Dijkstra nearly twenty years ago <ref> (Dijkstra 1976, p. 203) </ref>. The conceptual restrictions prevalent within PDES, as well as a penchant for working from a program view, result in model rep resentations (the programs) that are often contrived and unnatural descriptions of the system being modeled.

Reference-contexts: In the lead article, Fujimoto observes that a central problem for PDES is its failure to make a significant impact in the general simulation community during the last 15 years of its development <ref> (Fujimoto 1993a, p. 228) </ref>. Several factors are identified as contributing to this lack of impact, and various approaches are proposed to make parallel simulation more accessible to the simulation community.

Reference-contexts: These efforts are made manifest through life-cycle models for simulation. One such model is illustrated in Figure 1. This life-cycle model of a simulation study is described in detail in <ref> (Nance and Balci 1987) </ref>. Note that the entire structure serves to support one thing: the decision process. Note also the very limited role of the program within the life-cycle model.

Reference-contexts: Theoretically, if the model in the modeler's mind and the SPL utilize the same conceptual framework, the distance is closed. The traditional conceptual frameworks can best be described as providing a view of a system through varying localities <ref> (Overstreet 1982, p. 164) </ref>.
