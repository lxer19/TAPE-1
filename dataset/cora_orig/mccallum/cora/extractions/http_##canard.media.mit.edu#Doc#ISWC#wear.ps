Title: Canard: A Framework for Community Messaging  
Author: Pascal R. Chesnais 
Address: Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA  
Affiliation: MIT Media Laboratory

Note: SUBMITTED TO: ISWC FIRST INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON WEARABLE COMPUTERS  
Abstract: A portable and extensible framework for community messaging is described. It integrates off-the-shelf communications devices and protocols by converting them into a uniform message representation. Using personal databases, the relevancy of a message is evaluated and appropriate delivery channels selected. This framework is being tested with a group of forty students in a living group at MIT. They have been equipped with two-way pagers which can be carried at all times and work in concert with this communication framework. The framework's ability to autonomously manage communications, makes it a flexible model for the wearable community[1] where communications reliability is an issue.
