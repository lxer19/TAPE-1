Abstract: This paper describes the use of Machine Learning (ML) in LacePro, a multi-functional adaptive framework for learning, applying and consulting engineering procedures. In LacePro an incremental learning technique is being implemented to learn both, the rules that are used to select the tutoring strategy (based on the characteristics of the user and the procedure), and rules that define the user's preferences, as well.
