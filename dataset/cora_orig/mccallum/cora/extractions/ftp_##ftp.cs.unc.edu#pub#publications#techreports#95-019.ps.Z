Abstract: We present a system for fast and accurate display of CSG (constructive solid geometry) models. Such models have as primitives, polyhedra and solids whose boundaries can be represented using rational spline surfaces. As part of pre-processing, we compute the B-rep (boundary representation) from the CSG tree and represent the resulting solid using trimmed spline surfaces. No assumptions are made on the number of primitives or the degree of the primitives in the CSG tree. We also present an accurate, efficient and multiresolution representation of the high degree trimming curves. Given a trimmed spline model, we tessellate it into polygons as a function of the viewing parameters and render it using visibility computations and coherence between successive frames. The choice of a multiresolution representation of the model and the trimming curves is fundamental to the fast performance of the system. The system has been used to convert parts of a submarine storage and handling system model represented as more than 2; 000 CSG trees. The B-rep consists of more than 30; 000 trimmed spline surfaces and is displayed at interactive rates on the Pixel-Planes 5 graphics system.

The domain of the surface is defined on the unit square 0 s; t 1 in the (s; t) plane. <p> It encloses each surface with an axis-aligned bounding box, projects the bounding box along the X, Y and Z axis, sorts the resulting intervals and computes the overlapping bounding boxes based on them. Each Bezier surface is contained in the convex hull of its control points <ref> [Far93] </ref>. For each pair of overlapping bounding boxes, the algorithm checks whether the convex hulls of their control points intersect. This is reduced to a linear programming problem in three dimensions and solved using Seidel's incremental linear time algorithm [Sei90]. <p> The complete details of the solid modeling system is described in [KNM95]. 4 Display System In this section, we describe the trimmed NURBS visualization system. This system subdivides NURBS into trimmed Bezier surfaces <ref> [KML95, Far93] </ref>, which allow more efficient display than general splines. For trimmed Bezier surfaces we compute and store the smallest rectangular domain containing the trimmed region. Our algorithm tessellates the surface into triangles and renders them using the standard graphics pipeline.

However, no such robust algorithms and systems are known for solid models composed of curved or spline primitives [Hof89, RR92]. The main problem lies in accurate, robust and efficient computation of the intersection of spline surfaces. <p> Surface intersection is an active area of research and some of the recent papers have proposed algorithms to compute all components and piecewise linear or spline approximations to the intersection curves based on tracing methods <ref> [SN91, Hoh91, Hof89] </ref>.

Therefore, many of the current solids modelers use polyhedral approximations of these primitives and compute the B-rep's of the resulting solids in terms of polygons. <p> Currently our system handles primitives composed of tensor-product surfaces only, but can be easily extended to include solids defined using triangular surfaces. Furthermore, it makes the following set of assumptions for each Boolean operation: * All primitives are regularized solids <ref> [Hof89] </ref> and all Boolean operations result in regu larized solids. * The intersection between all pairs of overlapping surfaces is well-conditioned and there are no degeneracies. The system does not explicitly check whether these assumptions are satisfied. In some cases, it can detect these cases while running the algorithm. <p> However, the degree of the intersection curve can be as high as 4m 2 n 2 for two m fi n tensor-product surfaces and the curve cannot be exactly represented as a Bezier curve (for most cases) <ref> [Hof89] </ref>. Typical values of m and n are two or three and can be as high as 10 or 12, in practice. Furthermore, the intersection curve may consist of multiple components, closed loops, singularities etc., which add to its geometric complexity. <p> Furthermore, the intersection curve may consist of multiple components, closed loops, singularities etc., which add to its geometric complexity.

These algorithms compute piecewise linear or spline approximations of the intersection curve. However, when it comes to computing the B-reps of CSG models defined using a series of Boolean operations, these representations suffer from two important problems: 8 1. <p> The problem of building robust solid modeling systems based on floating-point computation is fairly open and no good solutions are known <ref> [Hof89] </ref>. In our case, the algorithm uses * tolerances at different parts of the overall algorithm. Depending on the values of the tolerances, the robustness of the algorithm can vary considerably.

Notice this is not much unlike Rockwood's <ref> [RHD89] </ref> monotone decomposition of trimming curves, except we avoid the overhead of actually doing the decomposition and dividing the patches. Crack Prevention: A trimming curve of a patch is a sequence of curves of intersection with neighboring patches. Each of these component curves are shared by two patches. <p> As we zoom in or out on a model, it produces different levels of detail incrementally and no visual artifacts appear. The trimming algorithm also works for trimming curves represented as piecewise linear or spline curves. Compared to Rockwood et. al. <ref> [RHD89] </ref> algorithm, our trimming algorithm is faster by a factor of seven or eight on models consisting of about 200 surfaces on an SGI Onyx. It also produces fewer triangles. We used SGI's GL library implementation of [RHD89] algorithm for comparison. <p> Compared to Rockwood et. al. <ref> [RHD89] </ref> algorithm, our trimming algorithm is faster by a factor of seven or eight on models consisting of about 200 surfaces on an SGI Onyx.

Reference-contexts: For each pair of overlapping bounding boxes, the algorithm checks whether the convex hulls of their control points intersect. This is reduced to a linear programming problem in three dimensions and solved using Seidel's incremental linear time algorithm <ref> [Sei90] </ref>. Let F (s; t) be a trimmed surface and its trimmed subset in the domain 0 s; t 1 be bounded by curve segments t 1 ; t 2 ; : : : ; t k .

Reference-contexts: Compute a dense linear approximation for each algebraic space curve and a polygonal approximation (P ) of the domain of F (s; t). Let Q be the corresponding polygonal approximation of the domain of G (u; v). Compute a triangulation of the domains based on Seidel's algorithm <ref> [Sei91] </ref>. 2. Using a dense linear approximation of c i and c i , compute their maximal subsets that lie within P and Q. Approximations to the intersection points (with either P or Q) are computed between the resulting line segments. <p> If the number of intersections is odd the point is inside the solid, otherwise it is outside. The intersection of rays with trimmed Bezier surfaces is computed using eigenvalue methods [MD94] and checking whether 10 the resulting intersection point lies inside the trimmed domain is based on Seidel's algorithm <ref> [Sei91] </ref>. The intersection curves between the boundaries of the two solids partition the surfaces into multiple regions. These regions have the property that all points in their interior are either inside or outside the other solid. <p> The marked cells form a staircase like polygonal chain 1 as shown in Fig. 8. The trimming curve forms another polygonal chain offset from the staircase. Partition this region across cell edges. 5. Triangulate each resulting simple polygon. (We use Siedel's algorithm <ref> [Sei91] </ref>.) To prevent cracks in the display, no additional points on the curve are introduced in the region partitioning step or the triangulation step. 4.1 Tessellation of Surface Since we are targeting engineering applications, we assume that models are regularized solids. There are no self intersecting patches.

Reference-contexts: Surface intersection is an active area of research and some of the recent papers have proposed algorithms to compute all components and piecewise linear or spline approximations to the intersection curves based on tracing methods <ref> [SN91, Hoh91, Hof89] </ref>. However, these representations are either inaccurate or inconsistent for Boolean operations on complex models. Therefore, many of the current solids modelers use polyhedral approximations of these primitives and compute the B-rep's of the resulting solids in terms of polygons. <p> Furthermore, the intersection curve may consist of multiple components, closed loops, singularities etc., which add to its geometric complexity. A number of algorithms based on subdivision methods, lattice evaluation and marching methods <ref> [SN91, Hoh91, Hof89, KM95a] </ref> are known. These algorithms compute piecewise linear or spline approximations of the intersection curve. However, when it comes to computing the B-reps of CSG models defined using a series of Boolean operations, these representations suffer from two important problems: 8 1.
