Abstract: It is commonplace in artificial intelligence to divide an agent's explicit beliefs into two parts: the beliefs explicitly represented or manifest in memory, and the implicitly represented or constructive beliefs that are repeatedly reconstructed when needed rather than memorized. Many theories of knowledge view the relation between manifest and constructive beliefs as a logical relation, with the manifest beliefs representing the constructive beliefs through a logic of belief. This view, however, limits the ability of a theory to treat incomplete or inconsistent sets of beliefs in useful ways. We argue that a more illuminating view is that belief is the result of rational representation. In this theory, the agent obtains its constructive beliefs by using its manifest beliefs and preferences to rationally (in the sense of decision theory) choose the most useful conclusions indicated by the manifest beliefs.

Reference-contexts: In the latter case, the logic has embedded concepts, and may have important nonstandard characteristics (e.g., proof procedures do not always exist; see especially <ref> (Barwise 1985) </ref>). 4 Even though the logical conception of manifest and constructive belief is, through the use of nonstandard logics, wide enough to incorporate many interesting theories, it is not free of difficulties.

Reference-contexts: Rascal rationally concludes that if there is any chance of his overlooking any taxes that he would not pay, he is better off not knowing about them. (For a game-theoretic treatment of less contrived examples of rational ignorance, see <ref> (Cave 1983) </ref>.) We may summarize this discussion in the observation that resource-limited reasoning is really a code-word for the economics of reasoning, for the rational allocation of mental resources.

Reference-contexts: See (Doyle 1980, 1988a) for treatments of patterns of successively reflective preferences about preferences and reasoning about reasoning as elements of a theory of rationally bounded rationality. Two related but in many ways simpler approaches towards mechanizing rational representation may be found in reason maintenance systems <ref> (Doyle 1979) </ref>. The first of these is to approximate rational choice by finding some more easily computable condition that entails rationality. Reason maintenance does this by basing constructive beliefs on reasons or justifications, and requiring that constructive beliefs be grounded or possess well-founded support in terms of these reasons.

Reference-contexts: But when closely examined, they are clearly based on rational responses to computational problems involving incomplete information (see <ref> (Doyle 1983) </ref> and (Shoham 1987)). Taking action requires information about the available actions, about their expected consequences, and about the utility of these consequences to the agent. <p> Specifically, grounded sets are Pareto-optimal choices with respect to the preferences expressed by reasons <ref> (Doyle 1983, 1985) </ref>. But this approximation to rationality is not perfect, since not all of the agent's preferences are taken into account.

Reference-contexts: In fact, rational representation is just one element of a rich interplay between the various forms of rationality in representation and reasoning. A comprehensive treatment of these forms and their interactions is beyond the scope of this paper, but is pursued in <ref> (Doyle 1988a) </ref>. <p> See <ref> (Doyle 1988a) </ref> and (Gardenfors 1988).)

Reference-contexts: We cannot pursue the point here, but reasoning with conflicting default rules turns out to be formally the same problem as decision-making or self-government by groups of people, thus justifying the second sense of the term "representation." See <ref> (Doyle and Wellman 1988) </ref> for more on this connection between rational knowledge representation and theories of social or political decision-making. 11 6 Rational expenditure of limited resources If an agent's manifest beliefs and derivation rules are logically consistent and complete, then the consequences of these beliefs are decidable.

Reference-contexts: 8.) Although just what choosing "rationally" might mean in this context is a topic of great depth, to convey the basic idea as simply as possible we employ here the standard conception of rationality, in which a choice is rational if it is of maximal expected utility (see, for example, <ref> (Jeffrey 1983) </ref>). In addition to ordinary beliefs and desires which merely evaluate events as true or false and good or bad, the agent is presumed to possess sets of comparative attitudes, including probabilistic comparisons of events as likelier or less likely, and preferential comparisons of events as better or worse. <p> If preferences may be constructive, rather than always manifest, then the proper definition of constructive attitudes should involve rational choice with respect to the constructed preferences themselves, not just with respect to the manifest preferences. This makes each choice of constructive beliefs what Jeffrey <ref> (Jeffrey 1983) </ref> calls a ratified decision, that is, a choice that is rational with respect to the set of attitudes resulting from that choice.

Reference-contexts: They instead pay more attention to the division between conscious and unconscious belief, arguably a different distinction than either explicit/implicit or manifest/constructive (but see <ref> (Konolige 1986) </ref>). This paper considers some limitations of one element of this conception, namely the idea that the derivation of constructive and implicit beliefs from manifest beliefs is in substance logical, describable by a logic of belief.

Reference-contexts: Some draw only those conclusions holding in every maximal consistent subset of the hypotheses (see, for example, (Rescher 1964)). Others, such as relevance logic, draw all conclusions entailed by any consistent subset and tag each conclusion with the subset supporting it (see, for instance, (de Kleer 1986) and <ref> (Martins and Shapiro 1983) </ref>). Unfortunately, none of these purely logical approaches really offer any guidance in acting with inconsistent beliefs. Acting on the basis of a consistent subset of the manifest beliefs is reasonable, but none of the logics help decide which subset to use.

Reference-contexts: Logic may be used in the same way to formalize meteorology or any other subject matter. Using logic to formalize psychology does not thereby make mental operations inherently logical operations, any more than using logic to formalize meteorological events thereby makes thunderstorms inherently logical operations. (See also <ref> (McDermott 1987) </ref>.) Now consider the case of ideal standards for representation. There are reasonable temptations to associate the representational dimension of reasoning with the logical sense of inference.

Reference-contexts: One such theory is that embodied in Doyle's (1979) reason maintenance system, which has received formal treatments including McDermott and Doyle's <ref> (1980, McDermott 1982) </ref> nonmonotonic logics, Reiter's (1980) logic of defaults, Moore's (1983) autoepistemic logic, and Doyle's (1983) theories of reasoned assumptions. The problem here is not that the agent's beliefs may have different models (or, as in circumscription, minimal models) in which different things are true.

Reference-contexts: Let us examine these claims in more detail. It is natural to view representation and reasoning as relations along orthogonal dimensions when we view an agent at the knowledge level <ref> (Newell 1982) </ref>. In one dimension, we view the representation relation F as an instantaneous relation between synchronic sets of manifest and constructive beliefs. In the temporal dimension, we view the state changes of the agent as a relation t connecting each state of the agent with its possible successors.

Reference-contexts: Ordinary logic does not say which consistent sets to consider, but some special logics have been developed specifically for reasoning with inconsistent hypotheses. Some draw only those conclusions holding in every maximal consistent subset of the hypotheses (see, for example, <ref> (Rescher 1964) </ref>). Others, such as relevance logic, draw all conclusions entailed by any consistent subset and tag each conclusion with the subset supporting it (see, for instance, (de Kleer 1986) and (Martins and Shapiro 1983)).

Taking action requires information about the available actions, about their expected consequences, and about the utility of these consequences to the agent. Ordinarily, obtaining such information requires effort, it being costly to acquire the raw data and costly to analyze the data for the information desired.
