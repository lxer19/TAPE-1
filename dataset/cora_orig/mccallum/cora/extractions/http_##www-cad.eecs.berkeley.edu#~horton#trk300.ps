Reference-contexts: Previous acceleration sensors used large masses (mm scale) and e m-bedded piezoresistors in the hinge. These sensors are an order of magnitude larger and impossible to integrate onto a single chip <ref> [1] </ref>. The device chosen in this design is the Analog Devices (ADXL05) because of its small size (10 pin TO-100), excellent noise bandwidth specification, and the ability to integrate onboard electronics [2].

The ADXL05 contains a polysilicon surface micromachined sensor and signal conditioning circuitry which implements a force ba lance control loop. Fig. 2.1 shows the accelerometer subci r-cuit. The output of the acceleration sensor is a voltage lin early proportional to acceleration.
