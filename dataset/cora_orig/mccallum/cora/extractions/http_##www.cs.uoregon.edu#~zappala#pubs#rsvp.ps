Reference-contexts: Thus, the second component of the architecture is a routing protocol that can provide quality unicast and multicast paths. There are many approaches to unicast routing; References <ref> [1, 5, 17] </ref> describe different approaches to multicast routing. None of the current proposals have yet dealt sufficiently with the interaction between routing and quality of service constraints; that is the subject of future research. <p> However, the general protocol design should be independent of these. In particular, our protocol should be capable of establishing reservations across networks that implement different routing algorithms, such as IP unicast routing, IP multicast routing [5], the recently proposed CBT (Core-Based Tree) multicast routing <ref> [1] </ref>, or some future routing protocols. This design goal makes RSVP deployable in many contexts.

Reference-contexts: implementation, but no systematic performance studies have been done as yet. 16 7 Related Work In the course of exploring network algorithms that deliver quality of service guarantees, there have been several proposals and prototype implementations of network resource reservation algorithms over the last few years (see, for example, [6], <ref> [2] </ref>). However, almost all of these prototypes deal exclusively with unicast reservations. The Stream Protocol, ST [7], was a pioneering work in multicast reservation protocol design. ST was designed specifically to support voice conferencing and was capable of making both unicast and multicast resource reservations.

Reference-contexts: To be able to adjust resource reservations accordingly, and in a way transparent to end applications, RSVP keeps soft-state at intermediate switches and leaves the responsibility of maintaining the reservation to end users. The term soft-state was first used by Clark in <ref> [3] </ref> and, in our context, refers to state maintained at network switches which, when lost, will be automatically reinstated by RSVP soon thereafter.

Reference-contexts: It is the packet scheduling algorithm which controls this decision. The packet scheduling algorithm lies at the heart of any network architecture because it determines which qualities of service the network to can provide. There are many proposed packet scheduling algorithms; see References <ref> [4, 6, 8, 11, 12] </ref> for a few examples. In this article we present our proposal for the third component of the architecture, a new resource ReSerVation Protocol, RSVP. Similar to previous work on resource reservation protocols (e.g.

The idea of the receiver-initiated approach was first inspired by Deering's work on IP multicast routing <ref> [5] </ref>. The IP multicast routing protocol treats senders and receivers separately. A sender sends to a multicast group in exactly the same way as it sends to a single receiver; it merely puts in each packet a multicast group address in place of a host address.

Reference: [9] <author> Jacobson, V., </author> <title> private communication </title>
Reference-contexts: In fact, filters could be applied to flows even without reserved resources. Furthermore, there are filter styles besides the ones described here that might be useful. For instance, as has been proposed by Jacobson <ref> [9] </ref>, for remote lectures with several speakers at separate sites one might want a dynamic filtered reservation where the filter is the same for each receiver; this feature would allow the audience to switch (in unison) to different speakers with only one set of resources reserved.

Reference-contexts: In some sense the flowspec is the central component of the architecture, since it embodies the service interface that applications will interact with; the details of all of the other components of the architecture are hidden from applications. Two proposals for a flowspec are described in References <ref> [14, 17] </ref>. Routing The network must decide how to transport packets from the source to the receiver or, in the case of multicast, receivers of the flow. Thus, the second component of the architecture is a routing protocol that can provide quality unicast and multicast paths.

Reference-contexts: Because each data source makes its reservation independently, a single pipe is reserved from every source to every receiver in the same multicast application group. An analysis of ST-II implementation and design issues is provided in <ref> [15] </ref>. Thus, neither ST nor ST-II provides a robust and efficient solution to the multipoint-to-multipoint resource reservation problem; they share several of the limitations of the strawman proposal described earlier. The RSVP design effort was initiated to fill this vacuum.

Similar to previous work on resource reservation protocols (e.g. ST-II <ref> [17] </ref>), RSVP is a simplex protocol, i.e. it reserves resources in one direction. However, several novel features in the RSVP design lead to the unique flexibility and scalability of the protocol. <p> However ST requires a centralized Access Controller to coordinate among all the participants and to manage the tree establishment. The successor to ST, ST-II <ref> [17] </ref>, continues to create its own multicast trees by blending the paths from unicast routing; however, ST-II establishes multiple simplex reservations to eliminate the Access Controller.
