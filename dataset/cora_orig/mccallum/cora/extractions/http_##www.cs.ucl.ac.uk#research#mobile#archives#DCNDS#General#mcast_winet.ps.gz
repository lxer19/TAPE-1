Abstract: To accommodate mobile hosts (MHs) within existing data networks, the static network is augmented with mobile support stations (MSSs) that communicate directly with MHs, usually via wireless links. Connectivity of the overall network changes dynamically as MHs connect to the static network from different locations (MSSs) at different times. Compared to their desktop counterparts, mobile hosts face a new set of constraints namely, low bandwidth of the wireless links, tight constraints on power consumption and a significantly lower computing capability. Thus, even without considering failures, integration of mobile computers within existing networks pose a new set of problems. In this paper, we look at the problems associated with delivering multicast messages to mobile hosts. First, we identify how a mobile host's ability to connect to different MSSs at different times, affects delivery of multicast messages and present schemes to deliver multicast messages to MHs from atleast-one location, from atmost-one location, and from exactly-one location. Next, we introduce multicast groups of mobile hosts wherein each multicast group is associated with a host view, a set of MSSs representing the aggregate location information of the group. A host-view membership algorithm is then presented and combined with the multicast scheme for exactly-once delivery. As a result, to deliver a multicast message to a specified group, copies of the message need be propagated only to the MSSs in the group's host-view.

Reference-contexts: At the network layer, this has led to research on new addressing schemes and protocols for routing messages to and from mobile hosts <ref> [1, 14, 25, 32, 33] </ref>. Mobile computing also has important implications for distributed data management [23] and in particular, has motivated the design of distributed filesystems aimed at mobile users [20, 22, 27, 31]. The implications of host mobility for distributed computations are discussed in [3, 8, 7, 9]. <p> Our work differs from current research on network protocols for mobile hosts <ref> [1, 14, 25, 32, 33] </ref> in three key respects. First, a common design goal of the referenced work is to keep host mobility transparent to transport layer and above, and therefore, tackle host mobility through new addressing mechanisms and protocols at the network and link layers. <p> can delete their local copies only after m is delivered to all intended recipients. 3.3 Multicast vs. multiple unicasts It is possible to achieve the functionality of multicast-ing a message to a set of MHs by separately sending a copy to each recipient using point-to-point mobile inter-networking schemes such as <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> The first consists of searching for an MH within a pre-defined region (such as a campus in [25]). If a multicast is simulated by multiple unicasts, then a search cost is incurred for each recipient using this strategy. In the second strategy <ref> [1] </ref>, the current location of each MH is kept at its home agent. A packet is first routed to the MH's home agent which is then responsible for forwarding it to the MH's current location. <p> On the other hand, ensuring atleast-once delivery requires that a copy be available at the local MSS of every intended recipient. One approach to reconcile both requirements, could be to track the location of each MH individually, as proposed in <ref> [1] </ref> for routing 5 A similar metric call to message ratio has been proposed in [10]. 11 unicast messages; however, in this scheme, every move by each MH will result in a location update.

Reference-contexts: Multicasting ne 1 cessitates sending copies of a message to different MSSs (cells); due to an MH's ability to move between different cells, a multicast message may be delivered to a recipient at multiple cells or may not be delivered at all depending on the recipient's mobility <ref> [2] </ref>. Delivering multicast messages, regardless of the location of recipients, can be used to invalidate or update copies of shared data cached at different mobile hosts (e.g., files, stock market information), or for supporting multiperson interaction based on group communication between mobile computers [19].

Reference-contexts: Mobile computing also has important implications for distributed data management [23] and in particular, has motivated the design of distributed filesystems aimed at mobile users [20, 22, 27, 31]. The implications of host mobility for distributed computations are discussed in <ref> [3, 8, 7, 9] </ref>. Mobility of hosts introduces a new set of problems not found in networks comprising solely of static hosts. First, since the location of an MH changes on every move, its current location needs to be first determined before a message can be routed to it. <p> This is accomplished by partitioning the multicast protocols into two interactions: one, that occurs entirely within the static network between MSSs and the second, that takes place solely within a single cell between an MSS and a local MH. This approach has also been used for structuring distributed algorithms <ref> [3, 8, 7] </ref> and for increasing TCP performance [11] for mobile hosts.

Reference-contexts: Finally, it is believed that regardless of technological progress, the ability of a host to be mobile/portable will extract a price in terms of processing power and memory i.e., mobile hosts will lag behind their static counterparts in these respects <ref> [5, 23] </ref>. Network algorithms to facilitate host mobility within a static network, need to be specifically tailored to tackle these constraints. This paper considers the effects of host mobility on reliable delivery of multicast messages. <p> This assumption will be more specifically stated later, in the context of individual multicasting schemes. 3 Motivation 3.1 Physical constraints Mobile hosts, such as palmtops and personal digital assistants, have significantly lower processing speed and memory capacity compared to their desktop counterparts <ref> [5, 23] </ref>. It is believed that irrespective of technological advances, the ability to be portable or mobile will cause mobile computers to lag static hosts in these respects.

Reference-contexts: First, since the location of an MH changes on every move, its current location needs to be first determined before a message can be routed to it. Second, bandwidth of the wireless link connecting an MH to an MSS is significantly lower than the (wired) links between static hosts <ref> [6, 29] </ref>. Third, mobile hosts have tight constraints on power consumption relative to desktop machines [6, 13, 24], since they usually operate on stand-alone sources such as battery cells. <p> Second, bandwidth of the wireless link connecting an MH to an MSS is significantly lower than the (wired) links between static hosts [6, 29].

A host that can move while retaining its network connections is a mobile host (MH). The infrastructure machines that communicate directly with the mobile hosts are called mobile support stations (MSS). A cell is a logical or geographical coverage area under an MSS. <p> More importantly, mobility of the recipients poses a more serious objection to this scheme, as explained below. Routing protocols for MHs are based on two basic strategies. The first consists of searching for an MH within a pre-defined region (such as a campus in <ref> [25] </ref>). If a multicast is simulated by multiple unicasts, then a search cost is incurred for each recipient using this strategy. In the second strategy [1], the current location of each MH is kept at its home agent. <p> How exactly this discovery takes place is not crucial to our protocols.

Consider an MH h that physically moves from the cell under M to N (step (1) of Fig. 3). <p> It is also responsible for enabling cell discovery by an MH, e.g. it may periodically broadcast (beacon) the MSS-id within the local cell, similar to the beacon protocol of <ref> [25] </ref>. The interaction between the WIRELESS module at N and a local MH h is as follows: F1. When h first enters the cell (from M), it sends a greeting () message. The WIRELESS module for wards this message to the HANDOFF module. F2.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, there exists a number of multicast routing protocols for static hosts, e.g. [12, 17, 30], but the effects of mobility on multicast routing [4] has started to received attention only of late. Similarly, there also exists a body of work on reliable multicast protocols <ref> [18, 21, 28] </ref> for static hosts. <p> It is assumed that a transport mechanism guarantees reliable, sequenced delivery of messages between any pair of MSSs. Further, if the static network supports a reliable multicast protocol <ref> [18, 21, 28] </ref>, then such a protocol can be used to meet the communication requirements of our protocols within the static infrastructure, rather than reliable point-to-point messages.

Reference-contexts: First, since the location of an MH changes on every move, its current location needs to be first determined before a message can be routed to it. Second, bandwidth of the wireless link connecting an MH to an MSS is significantly lower than the (wired) links between static hosts <ref> [6, 29] </ref>. Third, mobile hosts have tight constraints on power consumption relative to desktop machines [6, 13, 24], since they usually operate on stand-alone sources such as battery cells. <p> It is believed that irrespective of technological advances, the ability to be portable or mobile will cause mobile computers to lag static hosts in these respects. Second, the wireless link between a mobile host and its local MSS has a significantly lower bandwidth than a link between static hosts <ref> [6, 29] </ref>. These two points imply that protocols for mobile hosts should rely more on the computation and communication power of the static network than those of the MHs.

Reference-contexts: Second, they are primarily concerned with routing messages (datagrams) to/from an MH regardless of its location in the network. Third, their focus has been restricted to point-to-point messages. On the other hand, there exists a number of multicast routing protocols for static hosts, e.g. <ref> [12, 17, 30] </ref>, but the effects of mobility on multicast routing [4] has started to received attention only of late. Similarly, there also exists a body of work on reliable multicast protocols [18, 21, 28] for static hosts. <p> Alternatively, instead of using point-to-point message delivery between MSSs, a (best-effort delivery) multicasting service provided at the network layer <ref> [12, 17, 30] </ref> could be used to efficiently route copies of multicast, viewchange () or delete () messages amongst the MSSs comprising a host-view, with 7 This array stores the sequence numbers of the last message received by h from each MSS in the current incarnation of H G . additional
