Abstract: Congestion control mechanisms for ATM networks as selected by the ATM Forum traffic management group are described. Reasons behind these selections are explained. In particular, selection criterion for selection between rate-based and credit-based approach and the key points of the debate between these two approaches are presented. The approach that was finally selected and several other schemes that were considered are described.

Reference-contexts: Thus, long path VCs have fewer opportunities to increase and are beaten down more often than short path VCs. This was called the "beat-down problem [3]." One solution to the beat down problem is the selective feedback [31] or intelligent marking <ref> [1] </ref> in which a congested switch takes into account the current rate of the VC in addition to its congestion level in deciding whether to set the EFCI in the cell.

Reference-contexts: The two key proposals the credit based and the rate based that were discussed at length are described in detail in the next two sections. 6.1 Fast Resource Management This proposal from France Telecom <ref> [4] </ref> requires sources to send a resoure management (RM) cell requesting the desired bandwidth before actually sending the cells. If a switch cannot grant the request it simply drops the RM cell; the source times out and resends the request.

Reference-contexts: The next correct RM cell will bring the system to the correct operating point. We substantiated our arguments with simulation results for an explicit rate scheme designed by Anna Charny during her master thesis work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) <ref> [5] </ref>. The MIT scheme consists of each source sending an RM cell every nth data cell. <p> Charny <ref> [5] </ref> has shown that two iterations are sufficient for this procedure to converge. Charny also showed that the MIT scheme achieve max-min optimality in 4k round trips, where k is the number of bottlenecks.

ICC'95, </note> <month> June </month> <year> 1995. </year>
Reference-contexts: The switch computes a "fair share" and if congested it sets EFCI bits in cells belonging to only those VCs whose rates are above this fair share. The VCs with rates below fair share are not affected. 8.1 The MIT Scheme In July 1994, we <ref> [6] </ref> argued that the binary feedback was too slow for rate-based control in high-speed networks and that an explicit rate indication would not only be faster but would offer more flexibility to switch designers. The single-bit binary feedback can only tell the source whether it should go up or down.

Reference-contexts: may take some time before it can use the full capacity of the link even if there are no other users. 8 Rate-Based Approach This approach, which was eventually adopted as the standard was proposed originally by Mike Hluchyj and was extensively modified later by representatives from 22 different companies <ref> [7] </ref>. Original proposal consisted of a rate-based version of the DECbit scheme [18], which consists of end-to-end control using a single-bit feedback from the network. In the proposal, the switches monitor their queue lengths and if congested set EFCI in the cell headers.

Reference-contexts: This problem is fixed by segmenting the network in smaller pieces and letting the switches act as "virtual source" and/or "virtual destination." Figure 7 shows an example <ref> [8] </ref>. Switch A in the middle segment acts as a virtual destination and returns all RM cells received from the source as if the switch was the destination. Switch B in the same segment acts as a virtual source and generates RM cells as if it were a source.

Reference-contexts: In one such schemes, proposed by Roberts [39], the information from the returning RM cells is kept at the branching node and is returned whenever the next forward RM cell is received. 9 Credit vs Rate Debate After a considerable debate <ref> [9, 11, 34, 37] </ref>, which lasted for over a year, ATM Forum adopted the rate-based approach and rejected the credit-based approach. The debate was quite "religious" in the sense that believers of each approach had quite different goals in mind and were unwilling to compromise.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the network is always congested. 2. Staggered Source: The sources start at different times. This allows us to study the ramp-up (or ramp-down) time of the schemes. 3. Bursty Sources: These sources oscillate between active state and idle state. During active state, they generate a burst of cells <ref> [10] </ref>. This is a more realistic source model than a persistent source.

Reference-contexts: The most commonly used criterion for what is the correct share of bandwidth for a source in a network environment, is the so called "max-min allocation <ref> [12] </ref>." It provides the maximum possible bandwidth to the source receiving the least among all contending sources. Mathematically, it is defined as follows. Given a configuration with n contending sources, suppose the ith source gets a bandwidth x i .

Reference-contexts: With window-based control a slight difference between the current window and the optimal window will show up as a slight increase in queue length. With rate-based control, on the other hand, a slight difference in current rate and the optimal rate will show up as continuously increasing queue length <ref> [15, 16] </ref>. The reaction times have to be fast. We can no longer afford to take several round trips that the binary feedback requires to settle to the optimal operation. The explicit rate 16 feedback can get the source to the optimal operating point within a few round trips.

Reference-contexts: The cells are returned by the destination. The source uses the timestamp to measure the roundtrip delay and to deduce the level of congestion. This approach, which is similar to that described in Jain <ref> [17] </ref>, has the advantage that no explicit feedback is expected from the network and, therefore, it will work even if the path contained non-ATM networks.

Reference-contexts: Original proposal consisted of a rate-based version of the DECbit scheme <ref> [18] </ref>, which consists of end-to-end control using a single-bit feedback from the network. In the proposal, the switches monitor their queue lengths and if congested set EFCI in the cell headers. The destination monitors these indications for a periodic interval and sends an RM cell back to the source.

Reference-contexts: The overload is indicated if the queue length increases [44, 43]. 8.3 OSU Time-based Congestion Avoidance Jain, Kalyanaraman, and Viswanathan at the Ohio State University (OSU) have developed a series of explicit rate congestion avoidance schemes. The first scheme <ref> [19, 20] </ref> called the 18 OSU scheme consists of switches measuring their input rate over a fixed "averaging interval" and comparing it with their target rate to compute the current Load factor z: Load Factor z = Input rate Target Rate The target rate is set at slightly below, say, 85-95% <p> This algorithm called "Target Utilization Band (TUB) algorithm" was proven to lead to fairness <ref> [19] </ref>. The OSU scheme has three distinguishing features. First, it is a congestion avoidance scheme. It gives high throughput and low delay. By keeping the target rate slightly below the capacity, the algorithm ensures that the queues are very small, typically close to 1, resulting in low delay.

Reference-contexts: This meant that the RM cell overhead per source was fixed and increased as the number of sources increases. This was found to be unacceptable leading to the count-based scheme described next. In the count-based scheme <ref> [21] </ref>, the sources send RM cells after every n data cells, as in EPRCA. The switch rate adjustment algorithm is changed to encourage quick rise.

Reference-contexts: This allows the scheme to keep the three distinguishing feature while making the overhead independent of number of VCs. Newer versions of the OSU scheme, named "ERICA" (Explicit Congestion Indication for Congestion Avoidance) and "ERICA+" are count-based <ref> [22, 23] </ref>. 8.4 Congestion Avoidance using Proportional Control (CAPC) Andy Barnhart from Hughes Systems has proposed a scheme called "Congestion Avoidance using Proportional Control (CAPC)[2]." In this scheme, as in OSU scheme, the switches set 19 a target utilization slightly below 1. This helps keep the queue length small.

Reference-contexts: The fast resource management proposal was not accepted at the ATM Forum primarily because it would either cause excessive delay during normal operation or excessive loss during congestion. 6.2 Delay-Based Rate Control This proposal made by Fujitsu <ref> [24] </ref> requires that the sources monitor the round trip delay by periodically sending resource management (RM) cells that contain timestamp. The cells are returned by the destination. The source uses the timestamp to measure the roundtrip delay and to deduce the level of congestion.

Reference-contexts: The difference between the cells sent by the sender and those received by the receiver represents the number of cells lost on the link. The receiver reissues that many additional credits for that VC. The adaptive FCVC algorithm <ref> [25] </ref> consists of giving each VC only a fraction of the roundtrip delay worth of buffer allocation. The fraction depends upon the rate at which the VC uses the credit. For highly active VCs, the fraction is larger while for less active VCs, the fraction is smaller.

Reference-contexts: Originally proposed by Professor H. T. Kung, it was supported by Digital, BNR, FORE, Ascom-Timeplex, SMC, Brooktree, and Mitsubishi <ref> [26, 41] </ref>. The approach consists of per-link, per-VC, window flow control. Each link consists of a sender node (which can be a source end system or a switch) and a receiver node (which can be a switch or a destination end system).

Reference-contexts: It is, therefore, scalable in terms of number of VCs and guarantees zero cell loss. Unfortunately, neither the credit-based nor the rate-based camp found it acceptable since it contained elements from the opposite camp. 6.6 Fair queueing with Rate and Buffer feedback This proposal from Xerox and CISCO <ref> [27] </ref> consists of sources periodically sending RM cells to determine the bandwidth and buffer usage at their bottlenecks. The switches compute fair share of VCs. The minimum of the share at this switch and that from previous switches is placed in the RM cells.

Reference-contexts: Also, this method does not really require any standardization, since any source-destination pair can do this without involving the network. 6.3 Backward Explicit Congestion Notification (BECN) This method presented by N.E.T. <ref> [28, 29, 30] </ref> consists of switches monitoring their queue length and sending an RM cell back to source if congested. The sources reduce their rates by half on the receipt of the RM cell.

Reference-contexts: Thus, long path VCs have fewer opportunities to increase and are beaten down more often than short path VCs. This was called the "beat-down problem [3]." One solution to the beat down problem is the selective feedback <ref> [31] </ref> or intelligent marking [1] in which a congested switch takes into account the current rate of the VC in addition to its congestion level in deciding whether to set the EFCI in the cell.

Reference-contexts: To achieve fairness, the source recovery period was made proportional to the VC's rate so that lower the transmission rate the shorter the source recovery period. This scheme was dropped because it was found to be unfair. The sources receiving BECNs were not always the ones causing the congestion <ref> [32] </ref>. 6.4 Early Packet Discard This method presented by Sun Microsystems [35] is based on the observation that a packet consists of several cells. It is better to drop all cells of one packet then to randomly drop cells belonging to different packets.

Reference-contexts: It was pointed out <ref> [33] </ref> that the method may not be fair in the sense that the cell to arrive at a full buffer may not belong to the VC causing the congestion. 13 Note that this method does not require any inter-switch or source-switch communication and, therefore, it can be used without any standardization.

Reference-contexts: Originally proposed by Professor H. T. Kung, it was supported by Digital, BNR, FORE, Ascom-Timeplex, SMC, Brooktree, and Mitsubishi <ref> [26, 41] </ref>. The approach consists of per-link, per-VC, window flow control. Each link consists of a sender node (which can be a source end system or a switch) and a receiver node (which can be a switch or a destination end system).

Reference-contexts: Many switch vendors are implementing it. 6.5 Link Window with End-to-End Binary Rate This method presented by Tzeng and Siu <ref> [45] </ref>, consisted of combining good features of the credit-based and rate-based proposals being discussed at the time. It consists of using window flow control on every link and to use binary (EFCI-based) end-to-end rate control. The window control is per-link (and not per-VC as in credit-based scheme).

Different values of CDVT may specified for SCR and PCR. 3 Service Categories There are five categories of service. The QoS parameters for these categories are summarized in Table 1 and are explained below <ref> [46] </ref>: 1. Constant Bit Rate (CBR): This category is used for emulating circuit switching. The cell rate is constant. Cell loss ratio is specified for CLP=0 cells and may or may not be specified for CLP=1 cells.
