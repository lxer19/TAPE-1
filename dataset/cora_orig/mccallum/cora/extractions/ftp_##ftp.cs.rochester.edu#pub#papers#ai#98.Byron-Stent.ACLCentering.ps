Title: A Preliminary Model of Centering in Dialog  
Author: D. Byron and A. Stent 
Address: Rochester NY 14627, U.S.A.  
Affiliation: University of Rochester Computer Science Department  
Abstract: The centering framework explains local coherence by relating local focus and the form of referring expressions. It has proven useful in monolog, but its utility for multi-party discourse has not been shown, and a variety of issues must be tackled to adapt the model for dialog. This paper reports our application of three naive models of centering theory for dialog. These results will be used as baselines for evaluating future models. 1

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The centering framework <ref> (Grosz et al., 1995) </ref> is one of the most influential computational linguistics theories relating local focus to the form chosen for referring expressions. A number of studies have developed refinements and extensions of the theory (eg. <p> We chose very naive approximations to the original theory as a starting point. These results will be a baseline for evaluating more sophisticated models in the future. 2 The Centering model The centering framework <ref> (Grosz et al., 1995) </ref> makes three main claims: 1) given an utterance U n , the fl The authors would like to thank James Allen, Marilyn Walker, and the anonymous reviewers for many helpful comments on a preliminary draft of the paper. <p> Should the dialog participants, referred to via first- and second-person pronouns (1/2PPs), be considered `discourse entities' and included in Cf ? 2 We provide only the briefest sketch of the centering framework.
