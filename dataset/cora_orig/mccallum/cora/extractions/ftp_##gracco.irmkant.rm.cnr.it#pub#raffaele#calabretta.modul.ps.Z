Abstract: To investigate the issue of how modularity emerges in nature, we present an Artificial Life model that allow us to reproduce on the computer both the organisms (i.e., robots that have a genotype, a nervous system, and sensory and motor organs) and the environment in which organisms live, behave and reproduce. In our simulations neural networks are evolutionarily trained to control a mobile robot designed to keep an arena clear by picking up trash objects and releasing them outside the arena. During the evolutionary process modular neural networks, which control the robot's behavior, emerge as a result of genetic duplications. Preliminary simulation results show that duplication-based modular architecture outperforms the nonmod-ular architecture, which represents the starting architecture in our simulations. Moreover, an interaction between mutation and duplication rate emerges from our results. Our future goal is to use this model in order to explore the relationship between the evolutionary emergence of modularity and the phenomenon of gene duplication.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In evolutionary biology, the concept of modularity is used to capture the fact that the bodies of higher organisms appear to be composed of semi-autonomous units ([9]; [11]; <ref> [1] </ref>). It has been argued that modularity is a prerequisite for the adaptation of complex organisms: modularity would allow the adaptation of different functions with little or no interference from other functions ([1]). However, this explanation raises two important questions.

Reference-contexts: Examining organisms at various levels could be crucial for understanding their behavior, because often an explanation of what happens at one level can be found at another level (see, for example, [5]; <ref> [2] </ref>). In particular, one could hypothesize that the evolution of modularity results from the interaction among processes at different levels. In future work we will focus on the evolutionarily emergence of functionally different modules at the neural-behavioral level from gene duplication.

In more general terms, modularity requires that we look at a complex system from the point of view of three different and chronologically successive phases: the phase of emergence, the phase of actual functioning, and the phase of maintenance.

Reference-contexts: The robot has to look for 'garbage', somehow grasp it, and take it out of the arena (see <ref> [8] </ref>). The organism is a miniature mobile robot called Khep-era, developed at E.P.F.L. in Lausanne ([6]). The robot is supported by two wheels that allow it to move in various directions by regulating the speed of each wheel. <p> The walls are 3 cm in height and target objects are cylindrical boxes with a diameter of 2.3 cm and a height of 3 cm. The targets are positioned randomly inside the arena. To speed-up the evolutionary process a simulator was used (see <ref> [8] </ref>). In the present work we compare the results obtained with three different neural network architectures (see Figure 1). In all cases the robot has 7 sensor neurons and 4 motor neurons.
