Abstract: A previous experiment tested subjects' new/old judgments of previously-studied faces, distractors, and morphs between pairs of studied parents. We examine the extent to which models based on principal component analysis (eigenfaces) can predict human recognition of studied faces and false alarms to the distractors and morphs. We also compare eigenface models to the predictions of previous models based on the positions of faces in a multidimensional face space derived from a multidimensional scaling (MDS) of human similarity ratings. We find that the error in reconstructing a test face from its position in an eigenface space provides a good overall prediction of human familiarity ratings. However, the model has difficulty accounting for the fact that humans false alarm to morphs with similar parents more frequently than they false alarm to morphs with dissimilar parents. We ascribe this to the limitations of the simple reconstruction error-based model. We then outline preliminary work to improve the fine-grained fit within the eigenface-based modeling framework, and discuss the results' implications for exemplar- and face space-based models of face processing.

Reference-contexts: Figure 3 illustrates how well the reconstruction error ranking correlates with the human subjects' familiarity ranking of the studied images, using Kendall's t (a) <ref> (Kendall and Gibbons, 1990) </ref> as the rank correlation measure. The best correlation, with t (a) = 0.177, occurred at k = 23.

Reference-contexts: Busey and Tunnicliff (submitted) used the 6-dimensional MDS scores for each of the stimuli in a series of models tuned to predict the probability of the humans responding old to each image (hereafter referred to as P (old)). They applied two alternative versions of GCM, the Generalized Context Model <ref> (Nosofsky, 1986) </ref>, and SimSample, a model based on the assumption that a test face results in sampling a similar face from memory and a response of old if the similarity between the probe and sample are above some threshold.

Reference-contexts: First, several neural network architectures using Hebbian learning are capable of learning the principal components of a training set (Dia-mantaras and Kung, 1996). Second, many of the cells in monkey temporal cortex are sensitive to various aspects of face stimuli <ref> (Perrett et al., 1992) </ref>. Thus the PCA model is a biologically plausible candidate abstraction of the mech anisms involved in familiarity judgments. * Free parameters: PCA models have few free parameters, and these parameters can often be set in a principled manner independent of the specific effects being sought.

Reference-contexts: In an earlier study, Busey (in press) had subjects rate the similarity of all pairs in a large set of faces and morphs, then performed a multidimensional scaling (MDS) of these similarity ratings to create a 6-dimensional face space <ref> (Valentine and Endo, 1992) </ref>. Busey interpreted the resulting dimensions as representing 1) age, 2) race, 3) facial adiposity, 4) extent of facial hair, 5) head aspect ratio, and 6) hair color (shading).
