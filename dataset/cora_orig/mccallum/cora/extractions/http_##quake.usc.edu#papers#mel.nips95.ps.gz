Title: SEEMORE: A View-Based Approach to 3-D Object Recognition Using Multiple Visual Cues

Abstract: A neurally-inspired visual object recognition system is described called seemore, whose goal is to identify common objects from a large known set|independent of 3-D viewing angle, distance, and non-rigid distortion. seemore's database consists of 100 objects that are rigid (shovel), non-rigid (telephone cord), articulated (book), statistical (shrubbery), and complex (photographs of scenes). Recognition results were obtained using a set of 102 color and shape feature channels within a simple feedforward network architecture. In response to a test set of 600 novel test views (6 of each object) presented individually in color video images, seemore identified the object correctly 97% of the time (chance is 1%) using a nearest neighbor classifier. Similar levels of performance were obtained for the subset of 15 non-rigid objects. Generalization behavior reveals emergence of striking natural category structure not explicit in the input feature dimensions.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION In natural contexts, visual object recognition in humans is remarkably fast, reliable, and viewpoint invariant. The present approach to object recognition is "view-based" (e.g. see <ref> [Edelman and Bulthoff, 1992] </ref>), and has been guided by three main dogmas. First, the "natural" object recognition problem faced by visual animals involves a large number of objects and scenes, extensive visual experience, and no artificial distinctions among object classes, such as rigid, non-rigid, articulated, etc.

Reference-contexts: Second, when an object is recognized in the brain, the "heavy lifting" is done by the first wave of action potentials coursing from the retina to the inferotemporal cortex (IT) over a period of 100 ms <ref> [Oram and Perrett, 1992] </ref>. The computations carried out during this time can be modeled as a shallow but very wide feedforward network of simple image filtering operations.

Reference-contexts: The fact that shape categories, such as "photographs of rooms", or "smooth lumpy objects", cluster together in a feature space of such low binding order would therefore at first seem surprising. This phenomenon relates closely to the notion of "wickelfeatures" (see <ref> [Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986] </ref>, ch. 18), in which features (relating to phonemes) that bind spatial information only locally are nonetheless used to represent global patterns (words) with little or no residual ambiguity. The presegmentation of objects is a simplifying assumption that is clearly invalid in the real world.

Reference-contexts: The computations carried out during this time can be modeled as a shallow but very wide feedforward network of simple image filtering operations. Shallow means few processing levels, wide means a sparse, high-dimensional representation combining cues from multiple visual submodalities, such as color, texture, and contour <ref> [Tanaka et al., 1991] </ref>. Third, more complicated processing mechanisms, such as those involving focal attention, segmentation, binding, normalization, mental rotation, dynamic links, parts recognition, etc., may exist and may enhance recognition performance but are not necessary to explain rapid, robust recognition with objects in normal visual situations. <p> has been to explore the limits of performance of a shallow|but very wide|feedforward network of simple filtering operations for viewpoint-invariant 3-D object recognition, where the filter "channels" themselves have been loosely modeled after the shape- and color-sensitive visual response properties seen in the higher levels of the primate visual system <ref> [Tanaka et al., 1991] </ref>.
