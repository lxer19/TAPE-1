Title: Adaptation for Mobile Data Access  
Author: Brian D. Noble and M. Satyanarayanan 
Affiliation: School of Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University  
Abstract: A Research Status Report on Abstract Mobility demands that systems be adaptive. One approach is to make adaptation transparent to applications, allowing them to remain unchanged. An alternative approach views adaptation as a collaborative partnership between applications and the system. This paper is a status report on our research on both fronts. We report on our considerable experience with application-transparent adaptation in the Coda File System. We also describe our ongoing work on application-aware adaptation in Odyssey.

Reference-contexts: Coda users operate clients over 2 Mb/s radio links, and over modems as slow as 9600 baud. As network bandwidth decreases, the importance of reordering or delaying network traffic to preserve the illusion of strong connectivity increases <ref> [1] </ref>. To preserve the strongly-connected illusion, Venus endeavors to satisfy most demand cache misses as soon as possible, and delays other traffic as necessary. Faithful to the end-to-end argument, these decisions are made at as high a level in the system as possible.

Reference-contexts: This represents the range of approaches between the two extremes. 4. Coda: Application-Transparent Adaptation We have explored application-transparent adaptation extensively through our work in the Coda File System <ref> [4, 12] </ref>. Coda provides clients, particularly mobile ones, with highly available access to files. Like AFS, Coda presents a single, global namespace to clients organized in volumes [16], which are subtrees of the namespace. Applications running on Coda clients use the standard UNIX file system interface. <p> Venus continues to service reads and writes to files that are in-cache; reads and writes on files that are not cached cannot be serviced, and Venus returns an error for them. To reduce the likelihood of cache misses, Venus uses a mechanism called hoarding <ref> [4] </ref> to augment LRU cache management. Through hoarding, a user can provide advice on what files are likely to be important in the future. <p> Further Reading This paper provides only the briefest overview of our work.
