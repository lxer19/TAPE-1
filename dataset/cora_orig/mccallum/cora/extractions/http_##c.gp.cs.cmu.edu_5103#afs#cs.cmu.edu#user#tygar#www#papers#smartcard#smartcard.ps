Abstract: One often hears the claim that smart cards are the solution to a number of security problems, including those arising in point-of-sale systems. In this paper, we characterize the minimal properties necessary for the secure smart card point-of-sale transactions. Many proposed systems fail to provide these properties: problems arise from failures to provide secure communication channels between the user and the smart card while operating in a potentially hostile environment (such as a point-of-sale application.) Moreover, we discuss several types of modifications that can be made to give smart cards additional input/output capacity with a user, and describe how this additional I/O can address the hostile environment problem. We give a notation for describing the effectiveness of smart cards under various environmental assumptions. We discuss several security equivalences among different scenarios for smart cards in hostile environments. Using our notation, these equivalences include:

Reference-contexts: One way is for the smart card to present a random sequence of digits on its display unit <ref> [1] </ref>. The customer then sends a sequence of increment, decrement, and next-digit commands to the smart card via the public, unsecure communication channel. These commands alter the smart card's initial random value until the smart card displays the input value desired by the customer.

Reference-contexts: both stored value cards and electronic wallets ignore one very feasible attack: since traditional smart cards do not contain any provision for directly displaying output or directly receiving input from the customer, they must depend on the merchant's POS system for I/O with the customer (this problem was observed in <ref> [3, 13, 14] </ref>). This introduces a significant vulnerability: for example, a corrupt merchant might try to charge the customer's smart card $1000 for the purchase of a gold watch while truthfully reporting on his POS display that the purchase is for a $10 watch battery. <p> If keypads and displays on the smart card are infeasible, the customer could carry a trusted portable smart card reader <ref> [3] </ref>. In this sort of system, after the transaction parameters are transferred to the smart card, the customer would transfer the card from the merchant's terminal into the portable reader. Only if the customer approves the transaction would he move the card back to the merchant's terminal.

Digital cash approaches typically provide anonymous transactions, and use fewer assumptions about tamper-resistance.

The user has full control over the hardware embodying the representative, but has no internal access to the observer.

Reference-contexts: Many recent smart cards provide mechanisms that will cause any attempt to physically read data in the smart card to result in all data being zeroed (e.g., US Federal Information Processing Standard 140-1 <ref> [11] </ref>.) Similarly, the merchant's POS computer will contain a tamper-resistant register representing the merchant's account balance. When a customer makes a purchase, the smart card account balance is decremented by the amount of the purchase, and the merchant's POS account balance is incremented by the same amount.
