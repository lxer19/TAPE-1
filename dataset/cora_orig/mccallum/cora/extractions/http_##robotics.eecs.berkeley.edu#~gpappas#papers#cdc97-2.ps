Title: Noncooperative Conflict Resolution  
Author: Claire Tomlin, George J. Pappas and Shankar Sastry

Affiliation: Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences University of California at Berkeley  
Abstract: Air Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) of the future allow for the possibility of Free Flight, in which aircraft choose their own optimal routes, altitude and speed. In a free flight environment, the trajectories of different aircraft may be conflicting, in which case aircraft may or may not cooperate in resolving the conflict. In this paper, noncooperative conflict resolution methods based on game theory are presented. Each aircraft models the actions of other aircraft as disturbances and tries to defend against the worst possible disturbance. This framework is applied in resolving conflicts between aircraft using speed and heading changes.

Reference-contexts: Developing weather storms are sometimes reported from aircraft to ATC. In view of the above problems and in an effort to meet the challenges of the next century, the aviation community is working towards an innovative concept called Free Flight <ref> [1] </ref>. Free Flight allows pilots to choose their own routes, altitude and speed and essentially gives each aircraft the freedom to self-optimize. <p> It is rather clear that the success of Free Flight will depend on the relative time that each aircraft is allowed to optimize its own goals. Improved navigation and surveillance allow for the reduction of the protected zone to 3 nautical miles and 1,000 ft. Informal studies <ref> [1] </ref> show that given the same aircraft population and routes of flight such a reduction of the protected zone will result in a decrease of conflicts by almost 70% and would clearly increase airspace utilization. 3 This will allow aircraft to stay on their nominal, optimized trajectories for as long as

Reference-contexts: The economic benefits of Free Flight are immediate. Direct great circle routes, optimal altitudes, optimal avoidance of developing weather hazards and utilization of favorable winds will result in fuel burn and flight time operating cost savings. NASA studies <ref> [2] </ref> estimate that in a free flight scenario, user preferred trajectories could have resulted in annual potential savings of $1.28 billion in 1995 and could result in $1.47 billion savings in 2005 1 .

Reference-contexts: Free Flight is potentially feasible because of enabling technologies such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Datalink communications, Automatic Dependence Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS) <ref> [3] </ref> and powerful on-board computation. In addition, tools such as the Center-TRACON Automation System (CTAS) [4] will serve as decision support tools for ground controllers in an effort to reduce ATC workload and optimize capacity close to highly congested urban airports.
