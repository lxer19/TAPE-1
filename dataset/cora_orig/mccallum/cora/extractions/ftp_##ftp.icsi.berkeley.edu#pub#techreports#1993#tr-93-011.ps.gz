Abstract: Most of the solutions proposed to support real-time communication services in a packet-switching network adopt a connection-oriented and reservation-oriented approach. In this approach, the resource allocation and route selection decisions are made before the start of the application on the basis of resource availability and real-time network load at that time, and are usually kept for the duration of the application. However, such an approach shows two major limitations: first, the communication service provided is usually fixed, with no or limited capability of adaptation to dynamic changes in the clients' requirements; second, a low utilization of the network may be observed. In this paper, we present a flexible management scheme that allows graceful adaption of guaranteed performance service connections. Mechanisms have been devised to allow changing of the traffic and performance parameters of a real-time communication during its lifetime. These mechanisms, together with an adaption policy, can make more efficient use of the network resources by performing cooperative, consenting, high-level multiplexing. We distinguish between two types of adaptation: client initiated adaptation and network initiated adaptation.

Reference-contexts: Guaranteed performance service communication is needed to support these applications as the best-effort service provided by the traditional packet-switching networks is not adequate [5]. Several solutions have been proposed to support guaranteed performance service communication in packet-switching networks <ref> [1, 7, 12, 14] </ref>. They all adopt a connection-oriented and reservation-oriented approach. In such an approach, a connection is established within the network, and resources are reserved for it so that the performance requirements of the application are met. <p> The issues of adaptation of a communication service and, more generally, of dynamic management of real-time connections, have only been partially addressed in the literature. The proposals presented in [10] and <ref> [1] </ref> are characterized by a model where the interaction between a real-time network and its clients is minimal, and is limited to the establishment phase of a connection.

Reference-contexts: In terms of the client-network interaction, the current implementation of the scheme supports only partially flexibility and adaptivity of the network. Even though a connection administration protocol is expressly included in the protocol stack <ref> [2] </ref>, the capability of a client to dynamically interact with the network is still limited. Recently, two different solutions have been proposed to increase the adaptivity of real-time networks.

Reference-contexts: Even though a connection administration protocol is expressly included in the protocol stack [2], the capability of a client to dynamically interact with the network is still limited. Recently, two different solutions have been proposed to increase the adaptivity of real-time networks. In <ref> [3] </ref>, a new service, called predicted, is introduced in which the performance delivered by the network in terms of delay bounds is computed by measuring the current load, rather than by using precomputed, worst-case data. This service is proposed for a particular class of multimedia applications, called playback applications.

Reference-contexts: The second is that those applications will appreciate this flexibility as it provides a higher probability of having the communication service established by the network <ref> [4] </ref>, and possibly also a pricing scheme advantageous to the client. The other approach, the client initiated adaptation, allows a client to request a better quality of service, in terms of improvement of some or all of the performance parameters.

Reference-contexts: These applications have stringent network performance requirements in terms of parameters such as bandwidth, delay, delay jitter, loss rate or some combination of these. Guaranteed performance service communication is needed to support these applications as the best-effort service provided by the traditional packet-switching networks is not adequate <ref> [5] </ref>. Several solutions have been proposed to support guaranteed performance service communication in packet-switching networks [1, 7, 12, 14]. They all adopt a connection-oriented and reservation-oriented approach. <p> The delay requirements can be specified in terms of an absolute upper bound on the transmission delay (deterministic service), or of a probabilistic bound (statistical service), or as an upper bound for the delay jitter (bounded-jitter service) <ref> [5] </ref>. In terms of the client-network interaction, the current implementation of the scheme supports only partially flexibility and adaptivity of the network. Even though a connection administration protocol is expressly included in the protocol stack [2], the capability of a client to dynamically interact with the network is still limited.

Reference-contexts: J. Parris et al. 6 3.1 The Tenet Model In the Tenet Scheme, a guaranteed performance service connection (a real-time channel) is a communication abstraction that defines real-time communication services associated with traffic and performance parameters in a packet-switched network in accordance with the Tenet model <ref> [6] </ref>. A channel's real-time traffic is characterized by the following parameters: * X min the minimum packet inter-arrival time. * X ave the average packet inter-arrival time over an averaging interval. * I the averaging interval. * S max the maximum packet size.

A simple adaptation policy is also presented in Section 3. <p> A more general approach to assured quality of service is proposed by the Tenet scheme for real-time communication <ref> [7] </ref>. The client specifies its throughput requirements in terms of a minimum and an average inter-packet arrival time, the latter averaged over a client-specified interval. <p> To alleviate the problem, statistical guarantee service, in addition to the deterministic guarantee service, can be offered, to exploit the traffic burstiness and obtain statistical multiplexing gain <ref> [7] </ref>. Another way of addressing the problem is what we call cooperative, consenting, high-level multiplexing. This is achieved by allowing connections to adapt or modify their performance parameters in light of changes in clients' requirements and network state.
