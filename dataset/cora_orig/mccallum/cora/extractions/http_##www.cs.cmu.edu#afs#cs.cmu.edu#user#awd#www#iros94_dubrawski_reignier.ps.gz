Abstract: This paper deals with an application of a Fuzzy-ART self-organizing neural classifier to adaptive categorization of the perceptual space of a mobile robot. The aim of the presented research is to develop a learning system for reactive locomotion control in an unknown, cluttered environment. A qualitative description of the proposed categorization technique for a trial-and-error learning paradigm is given. Experimental results show that used method of control is efficient, when learning starts from scratch, as well as after some major disturbances of already experienced system.

Reference-contexts: Perceptual space quantizer contains a variable number of categories, which are created and merged according to overall control system requirements.

The role of the action associator plays a single-layer associative memory trained with a nonmonotonic reinforcement rule <ref> [2] </ref>. A drive action is equivalent to a command setting a required steering angle. The command is chosen from a discrete set of available actions. Evaluation modules test selected actions for their feasibility and efficiency. <p> In a similar way the action evaluation results influence the action association learning process. A more detailed description of the system architecture and its algorithm can be found in <ref> [2] </ref> or [3], in this paper we concentrate on a mechanism of perceptual space categorization process of the obstacle avoidance circuit, and its interaction with the locomotion reflexes learning. 3 Fuzzy-ART for perceptual space cat egorization Neural networks belonging to the ART family have several features, important for the described system

Reference-contexts: Such a feature limits incremental learning capabilities of the system, since averaging and redefinitions of a previously stored knowledge are allowed. A more sophisticated variation of the self-organizing map is employed in a system described in <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A natural way to construct such a system, featuring learning capabilities, is to implement a self-organizing neural network as a classifier of the perceptual space and a neural associative memory with a reinforcement learning rule as an associative agent. A system presented in <ref> [5] </ref>, employs a self-organizing map as a perceptual space partitioner. It keeps a number of perceptual categories constant while learning, as inherent in the implemented basic Kohonen's algorithm. Such a feature limits incremental learning capabilities of the system, since averaging and redefinitions of a previously stored knowledge are allowed.
