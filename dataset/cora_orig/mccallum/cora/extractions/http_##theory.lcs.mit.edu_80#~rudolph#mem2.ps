Abstract: The concurrent-read concurrent-write (CRCW) model of shared memory for parallel computation is considered unimplementable in practice, due to limitations of electronic technology. By using optical technology, however, these limitations may be overcome. An optical CRCW memory can be designed based on the following principles. First, optical free-space interconnections eliminate the need for shared switches that suffer from contention. Second, unlimited fan-in on detectors allows for concurrent writing without serialization. And third, retroreflec-tive optical elements that reverse the propagation of beams of light implement concurrent reads without address decoding and sequential service. It should be noted, however, that the required technology is still immature, and much work is needed before a practical design is reached.

Reference-contexts: By noting the absence of a returned pulse, the processor knows that the stored value is "0". This procedure is shown in figure 5. 1 It is interesting to note that an array of retroreflective prisms also produces an effect which is very similar to phase conjugation <ref> [2] </ref>. 10 If only one concurrent-read bit is required, the use of such an optical system is an overkill. With only one bit a controller is not required, so we could transmit the bit continuously to all the processors by an electronic line.

Reference-contexts: The wires must be isolated and separated from each other to prevent unwanted interactions between the signals, such as crosstalk. A sizable percentage of the hardware (and cost) of large multiprocessor systems is therefore devoted to interconnection media (see e.g. the GF11 <ref> [3] </ref>). The expenditure on interconnection media can be avoided if optical technology is used.

Reference-contexts: Concurrent reads are supported as follows. A processor that wants to read the stored value transmits a pulse of light towards the prism. The prism is protected by a switchable optical shutter, such as a Pockels cell [19, section 8.11.3] or an electrooptic modulator <ref> [20, 6] </ref>. If the shutter is clear, the pulse of light will be reversed by the prism, causing it to return to the processor that sent it. By sensing the returned pulse, the processor knows that the stored value is "1".

Reference-contexts: The above problems are automatically solved by reversing the propagation of these beams, causing them to retrace their paths and return to the processors. This may be accomplished by so called retroreflective optical elements, e.g. corner reflector prisms <ref> [13] </ref> (fig. 4; other possibilities are discussed below). Thus the return address is implicitly contained in the direction that the light comes from. No decoding or active routing are needed. Concurrent reads are supported as follows.

Reference-contexts: As photons do not interact with each other (as opposed to electrons which are subject to electromagnetic interactions), these beams of light can cross each other within the same volume without any ill effects. A certain volume is still needed in order to ensure full connectivity <ref> [15] </ref>, but this volume is full of air rather than being full of wires. This implies that optical free-space interconnections should have a strong economical advantage. Once the cost associated with the network is eliminated, the motivation for saving hardware by sharing it among a number of communication channels disappears. <p> The address is used as a command to the deflector to direct the beam in a certain direction (fig. 2).

Reference-contexts: Using a single multistage network the CRCW variables may become "hot spots" and degrade the performance of the whole memory system [32].

The work reported in this paper follows this suggestion. It is shown that a CRCW memory with low latency and no contention can be designed in principle, using optical technology. The basic design deals with single-bit memory elements, and multi-bit memory elements can be devised based on them.

The implementation of concurrent access is considered difficult, however, so algorithm designers tend to make an effort not to use simultaneous access to the same cell (e.g. [40, 9]). The model in which all cells are shared but not accessed simultaneously is called exclusive-read exclusive-write, or EREW PRAM [38]. The implementation of large-scale shared memory parallel computers has been an elusive goal. While small-scale systems can be built using a bus [4] or crossbar switch [41], the only approach suitable for large-scale machines seems to be multistage interconnection networks [17, 31, 33].

Reference-contexts: The maximal deflection angle dictates the amount of empty space that must be left between the processors and the memory [15]. Optical deflectors are readily available; the most common are based on acoustooptical phenomena <ref> [39] </ref>. Electrooptical deflectors have also been devised [21, section 14.2.2]. A largely overlooked problem with fully-connected optical free-space networks concerns collisions at the destination. If a number of processors attempt to communicate with the same destination at the same time, the data is garbled.

The main problem with multistage networks is the high latency that they introduce | every memory access must traverse a number of stages that is logarithmic in the number of processors.

Reference-contexts: These phase conjugate mirrors reverse light beams that fall on them only if the pump beams are present <ref> [10, 42] </ref>. The presense of the pump beams, and therefore the activity of the mirror, is used to represent the stored bit; by switching the pump beams on and off, the stored value is changed.
