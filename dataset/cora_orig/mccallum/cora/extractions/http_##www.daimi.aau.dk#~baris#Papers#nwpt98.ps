Abstract: Open maps have been used to define bisimulation for a range of different models in concurrency [JNW96, CN96, HN98]. Here we apply the approach to finite automata, i.e. labelled transition systems with final states. The ideas used to define bisimulation in terms of open maps for finite automata can also be used more generally, e.g. to transition systems with a set of propositions associated to each state. Normally, one would define a category with the models, in our case finite automata, as objects. We will follow a slightly different approach and map finite automata to transition systems. Given a finite automata, we define a transition system with the same set of states and same initial state. The alphabet of the automaton is extended with a special accept label, ff. The transition relation is extended by adding for each final state in the automaton a transition with label ff from the state to itself. This gives a one to one correspondence between the finite automata and the transition systems where a final state in the automaton corresponds to a state with an ff transition. Using the open maps theory for transition systems presented in [JNW96] we get a notion of bisimulation for finite automata which turns out to have a very natural characterisation. Looking at transition systems extended with a set of propositions (like the set of propositions in a Kripke model) where each state has a set of propositions associated to it, we can use the same technique. These extended transition systems can be translated into standard transition systems. This can be done by adding a new label to the alphabet for each proposition and for each state making a probe for each proposition associated with the state. Using the open maps framework we can define a bisimulation relation and relate it to the original model. This again turns out to be a very natural definition of bisimulation.
