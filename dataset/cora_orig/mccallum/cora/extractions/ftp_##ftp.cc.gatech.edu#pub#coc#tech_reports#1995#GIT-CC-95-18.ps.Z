Abstract: A revolution is occurring in the scope and range of information, communication and education services that will be made available to schools, libraries, town-halls, clinics and, most importantly, residences. These services will be provided initially, primarily over hybrid fiber-cable systems, either by telephone companies or cable companies. The old cable plant is being upgraded and used in totally new ways. The topology and physical characteristics of the upstream channel present new challenges for efficient channel access. We present a media access protocol that efficiently transfers data on this channel. A primary goal in the design was to keep the portion of the protocol resident in the station as simple as possible. Thus we use centralized control located in the cable head-end. A station wishing to transmit sends a request to the hear-end using a contention channel. The head-end acknowledges the request and then schedules the request, informing the station by means of a grant message when to transmit.

Reference-contexts: It is important that the protocol exploit the medium efficiently over a range of transmission speeds (say 1 - 100Mb/s) and over relatively long distances (up to 35 km, <ref> [IEEE94] </ref>). Latency should be relatively low so that voice converations and interactive games can be supported (less than a few 10s of ms).

Reference-contexts: This path should support communications services for telecommuting and access to information sources in addition to many other services. The existing twisted pair has been used to meet this need to date by means of data modems, ISDN and Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Loop <ref> [WARI91] </ref>. An alternative physical medium to twisted pair is a combination of optical fiber and coaxial cable referred to as Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC). This medium has caught the attention of both the cable industry and the telephone industry so that today many trials are being conducted using HFC.
