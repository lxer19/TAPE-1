Reference-contexts: This should be as close to V dd as possible, so that the loads will be deeply in the linear region and will not introduce significant nonlinearities. These three voltages are generated by a V T reference circuit <ref> [1] </ref>, described later. The method for controlling the swing is a variation of the common replica bias scheme. V L is used as the "desired" value of the lowest excursion of the differential signal from V dd .

Reference-contexts: A retiming circuit is a necessary complement to the functionality of the interface that has been described. 6.1 Using a Phase-Locked Loop The low-swing external interface has the consequence that a straightforward VCO-based phase-locked loop is not sufficient. The common frequency detectors, including the well known phase-frequency detector (PFD) <ref> [4] </ref>, need a CMOS level reference. Amplifying the external clock to CMOS voltage levels and using this as a reference introduces a large and unknown static phase error.

Reference-contexts: There has been an earlier implementation of the external interface described in this report that uses a PLL instead of the DLL <ref> [7] </ref> [17]. The architecture of this PLL is described briefly here. The external clock enters the PLL as a low-swing quasidifferential signal. It is first processed by the Main Loop, which is a common VCO-based PLL.

Reference-contexts: While for high performance an analog design is deemed necessary, a variety of delay stages based on our familiar inverter has been used for lower frequency applications <ref> [9] </ref> [10] [11] [16] [17]. Common digital stages with analog control are two variations of the basic inverter, known as the loaded inverter and the current-starved inverter, shown in figure 6.4. <p> Both delay elements are appropriate for a charge pump based design. Unfortunately, the large sensitivity of the delay to power supply noise makes them inappropriate for high frequency applications. The relative merits of these delay elements are discussed in <ref> [9] </ref>. A different approach, attractive for its simplicity, is an all-digital delay-locked loop. Such DLLs are based on fixed-delay elements. The delay is adjusted by selecting one of many outputs along the delay line. The resolution of this technique is limited by the delay of one stage.

Reference-contexts: Since proper sizing of the buffers gave quite good matching, I decided to go with this simpler approach. It is important to note that if transistors are sized empirically, achieving good matching with one set of process parameters does not guarantee matching with another set. Shoji <ref> [12] </ref> shows how the sizing must be done, in order to guarantee that matching is achieved regardless of P versus N strength. It turns out that the achieved matching between all clocks is quite good.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the flexibility of hand selection is lost. Therefore, some kind of dynamic control of the impedance of output drivers or on-chip termination resistors must be employed. The "Digital Transistor Array" (DTA) <ref> [13] </ref> is a type of output driver the impedance of which can be controlled in a digital way. In order to facilitate accurate control of the line impedances, a ground and/or power plane on the board is necessary.

Reference-contexts: Then, when it is turned on, it will function approximately as a current source. This is the technique known as current mode signaling. This has the advantage that it eliminates the wired-OR glitch in bidirectional wires <ref> [15] </ref>. In this case the wire is pulled down by an almost constant current, the I d;sat of the driver and obviously the pull-down time is proportional to the voltage swing.

Reference-contexts: Simulations at 27 ffi and 100 ffi resulted to a maximum variation of any of the reference outputs of only 150mV. For the comparator, a design described in <ref> [18] </ref> was chosen. It is a regenerative clocked comparator with high gain and high speed. The disadvantage of a clocked design is that the output is valid only on specific time intervals, but this is not a problem for this application, since the charge pump operates with discrete steps anyway.

Reference-contexts: Sensing for alignment | segment A Aligning the edge of the internal clock to that of the external low-swing (quasi) differential clock requires an analog sample-and-hold circuit and a differential comparator. Charge injection and noise coupling in general are the issues related to the sample-and-hold <ref> [20] </ref>, while speed and resolution are important considerations for the design of the comparator. The reader should keep in mind that this circuit is intended to be operated under the worst possible conditions | when the data and the clock switch at exactly the same time.

Reference-contexts: Every 16 bits (8 clock cycles) the data received so far is transferred in parallel to another register, the output of which is directly routed to the board, where it can be observed with a logic analyzer. TSPC latches <ref> [21] </ref> were used for most of the receiver and transmitter design. 8 3 DLL DESIGN 3 DLL design 3.1 Specifications As stated earlier, the purpose of the Delay Locked Loop is to generate the Receive and Transmit clocks, based on the quasidifferential input clock.

Reference-contexts: The exponential constant was simulated to be about 5 GHz. This, with 2 1 2 cycles given for synchronization, leads to an MTBF equal to about 30 years, for operation at 300MHz <ref> [22] </ref>. Segment A control and timing The operation of segment A is based on a small 4-state FSM. To protect operation of segment A from disturbances of the clock caused by segment B, locking of segment A starts only after segment B indicates it has locked.

Reference-contexts: If trace stubs are used to connect to the individual chips, they cause discon-tinuities and a potential source of reflections. Understandably, there is a tendency towards the use of point-to-point links in high performance systems. The Scalable Coherent Interface, or SCI <ref> [24] </ref>, is a recent IEEE standard (ANSI/IEEE std 1596/92) towards this direction. It specifies packet-based communication over unidirectional synchronous links. At 2ns/bit and 16-bit wide links, this provides a bandwidth of 1GB/sec each way. A prototype implementation of SCI was demonstrated by IBM in 1995 [25].
