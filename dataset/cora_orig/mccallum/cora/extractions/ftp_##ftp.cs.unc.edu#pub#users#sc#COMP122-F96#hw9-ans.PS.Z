Abstract: P-1 Exercise 26.2-1 (page 563). Run the Floyd-Warshall algorithm on the weighted directed graph of Figure 26.2. Show the matrix D (k) that results for each iteration of the outer loop. Solution: Check the diagonal entries of the result matrix for a negative value. We claim that there is a negative-weight cycle if and only if d (n-1) ii &lt; 0 for some vertex i. Now suppose that the graph has one or more negative-weight cycles, and consider the one with the fewest vertices. If it has just one vertex, then some w ii &lt; 0, so d ii starts out negative; since d values are never increased, it is also negative when the algorithm terminates. If it has at least two vertices, let k be the highest numbered vertex in the cycle, and let i be some other vertex on the cycle. d Solution: This updates the weight values in the wrong order, making the results incorrect. Try it on any simple example. P-4 Find a minimum-cost Hamiltonian cycle for the weighted directed graph represented by the matrix W = 6
