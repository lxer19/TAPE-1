Title: Hit-and-run mixes fast  
Author: Laszlo Lovasz 
Abstract: It is shown that the "hit-and-run" algorithm for sampling from a convex body K mixes in time O fl (n 2 R 2 =r 2 ), where R and r are the radii of the inscribed and circumscribed balls of K. Thus after appropriate preprocessing, hit-and-run produces an approximately uniformly distributed sample point in time O fl (n 3 ), which matches the best known bound for other sampling algorithms.

Reference-contexts: In our case, this would not be necessary, but since it can be made for free, we shall formulate our mixing results for the lazy walk. The first polynomial time sampling procedure was given by Dyer, Frieze and Kannan <ref> [5] </ref>. This uses a random walk on a sufficiently dense lattice. The walk with ball steps is defined as follows: let v be the current point. We generate a random point u from the ball with radius ffi about v.

Reference-contexts: It is known that after an appropriate affine tranformation, such a position can be achieved with R = n; and that from the point of view of sampling, we can delete a negligible part of K and thus achieve R = O ( p n) (we refer to <ref> [7] </ref> for details, and also for an algorithm to find such an affine transformation). <p> In this paper we shall assume that the walk starts from a distribution whose density is at most 2. We call this warm start. See <ref> [7, 9] </ref> for examples how this can be guaranteed in applications. Another technical trick often used is that the number of steps is not fixed, but is chosen from, say, a binomial distribution with appropriate mean. <p> The walk with ball steps is defined as follows: let v be the current point. We generate a random point u from the ball with radius ffi about v. If u 2 K, we move to u else we stay at v. It is proved in <ref> [7] </ref> that with warm start, this walk mixes in O fl (nR 2 =ffi 2 ) steps, provided ffi &lt; 1= n. The hit-and-run walk is defined as follows. <p> The value (x; r) (called in <ref> [7] </ref> the local conductance at x) is defined similarly, replacing the unit sphere S n by the unit ball B n . <p> It is not difficult to see that K r is convex, and that we have (x; r) &lt; 1=8 for each x 2 K r . The following lemma is a variant on a lemma in <ref> [7] </ref>, and not proved here: Lemma 1 Assume that K contains a unit ball. Then (K r ) 1 2 nr 3 Steps of hit-and-run Consider the hit-and-run walk in K. We start with an analytic formula for the transition probabilities.
