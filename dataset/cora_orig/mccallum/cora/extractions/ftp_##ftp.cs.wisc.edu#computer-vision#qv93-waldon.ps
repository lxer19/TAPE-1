Title: Dynamic Shading, Motion Parallax and Qualitative Shape

Abstract: We address the problem of qualitative shape recovery from moving surfaces. Our analysis is unique in that we consider specular interreflections and explore the effects of both motion parallax and changes in shading. To study this situation we define an image flow field called the reflection flow field, which describes the motion of reflection points and the motion of the surface. From a kinematic analysis, we show that the reflection flow is qualitatively different from the motion parallax because it is discontinuous at or near parabolic curves. We also show that when the gradient of the reflected image is strong, gradient-based flow measurement techniques approximate the reflection flow field and not the motion parallax. We conclude from these analyses that reliable qualitative shape information is generally available only at dis-continuities in the image flow field.

Closely related to our work is that of Blake and Bulthoff <ref> [2] </ref>, who used information from the movement of specular points on an object's surface to recover qualitative aspects of surface curvature. However, their method requires compensating for the effects of motion parallax; a computation that requires knowledge of the relative viewer/object velocity. <p> Blake and Bulthoff <ref> [2] </ref> analyzed the motion of spec-ularities for the case of a moving observer and a stationary object. <p> These discontinuities were used by Koenderink and van Doorn [9] as a basis for qualitative shape description vis-a-vis the aspect graph. A second type of discontinuity occurs when (2 (T n)W K nT ) is singular. As pointed out by Blake and Bulthoff <ref> [2] </ref>, this happens on or near a parabolic curve on the surface. In fact, under orthographic projection, a discontinuity will exist whenever W is singular (i.e., when either of the principle curvatures is zero).

Reference-contexts: Fortunately, some invariants do exist. We have shown that discontinuities of the flow occur either on or near parabolic curves or at occluding boundaries. Knowledge of the location and connectivity of these curves has been shown to determine significant topological characteristics of an object's shape <ref> [8] </ref>. In addition, since the flow velocity in the neighborhood of the parabolic curve is large compared to the flow on other parts of the surface, it should be possible to determine the underlying cause of the discontinuity.
