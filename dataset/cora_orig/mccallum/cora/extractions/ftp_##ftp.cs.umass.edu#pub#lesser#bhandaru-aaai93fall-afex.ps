Abstract: A common paradigm in object recognition is to extract symbolic and/or numeric features from an image as a preprocessing step for classification. The machine learning and pattern recognition communities have produced many techniques for classifying instances given such features. In contrast, learning to extract a distinguishing set of features that will lead to unambiguous instance classification has received comparatively little attention. We propose a learning paradigm that integrates feature extraction and classifier induction, exploiting their close interrelationship to give improved classification performance.

Reference-contexts: This can be significant when neural net classifiers are used. When a decision tree classifier is used irrelevant features tend to carry lower weight or do not get tested at all <ref> [Brodley93] </ref>. Large feature sets also require larger training sets, which may be an issue if training data is difficult to obtain. Discarding a feature: Features that are irrelevant can be identified by considering the improvement in classification accuracy as a result of including them consecutively. <p> Features can be as simple as the intensity of a spectral channel or more complex, such as a spatial property governed by mask parameters (window size, measure etc). Although any classification technique can be used within this framework, we are using a Linear Machine Decision Tree (LMDT) <ref> [Brodley93] </ref>. We use a the thermal training rule which allows for multiple object classes. We shall use a gradient descent approach in our search of the feature space. We are testing the paradigm on the Wien landsat data [Wein].

Reference-contexts: Adaptive feature extraction (adaptive front-end) capabilities are necessary to cope with such perceptual tasks. The Schema Learning System [Draper93], Goldie [Kohl87], and TRIPLES [Ming90] concentrate on selecting a subset from a large but finite set of features to efficiently disambiguate classes. Flexible software architectures <ref> [Bhanu90, Lesser93] </ref> have been developed for adapting FEP and parameters to the environment being monitored. The above systems rely, however, on either implicit or explicit hand-crafted object descriptions. The issue of automating the acquisition of object descriptions for such adaptive front-end systems has not been addressed.
