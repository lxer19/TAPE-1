Abstract: An n-ary Steiner law f(x 1 ; x 2 ; ; x n ) on a projective curve over an algebraically closed field k is a totally symmetric n-ary morphism f from n to satisfying the universal identity An element e in is called an idempotent for f if f(e; e; ; e) = e. The binary morphism x fl y of the classical chord-tangent construction on a non-singular cubic curve is an example of a binary Steiner law on the curve, and the idempotents of fl are precisely the inflection points of the curve. In this paper, we prove that if f and g are two 5-ary Steiner laws on an elliptic curve sharing a common idempotent, then f = g. We use a new rule of inference rule =(gL)) , extracted from a powerful local-to-global f (x 1 ; x 2 ; ; x n1 ; f (x 1 ; x 2 ; ; x n )) = x n :

Reference-contexts: This corollary was first proved for plane cubic curves by I. M. S. Etherington using the classical Bezout theorem (see <ref> [1] </ref>). In [7], Padmanabhan gave a proof for elliptic curves over an arbitrary algebraically closed field k (see also Knapp [2, pp. 67-74]). Proof.

Reference-contexts: Proof. A nonsingular cubic curve is an Abelian variety and hence, as mentioned in the introduction, satisfies (the rigidity lemma and consequently) the rule (gL) for all morphisms. 5 3 Otter and the Implementation of =(gL)) Otter <ref> [3] </ref> is a computer program that attempts to prove theorems stated in first-order logic with equality. Here we restrict our attention to its capabilities in equational logic.

Reference-contexts: Then the unique sixth point F (x; y; z; t; u) can be found by a simple ruler construction as shown in Figure 3; a proof using the rigidity lemma was given (xy)(zt) z zt t by N. S. Mendelsohn, R. Padmanabhan, and B. Wolk in <ref> [4] </ref>). Here we characterize the above synthetic geometric process by means of equational identities. The 5-ary law is totally symmetric in all of its five arguments, and every inflection point is an idempotent for f : f (e; e; e; e; e) = e.

Reference-contexts: This is the heart of several uniqueness theorems of algebraic structures in mathematics. An analog in algebraic geometry is the so-called Chow's theorem <ref> [7, p. 67] </ref>: "Every compact complex manifold has at most one algebraic structure, and moreover, every compact 1-dimensional complex manifold admits a unique algebraic structure". These are analytically isomorphic to projective varieties. <p> This idea of viewing (gL) as an inference rule was first stated and systematically used by R. Padmanabhan in <ref> [7] </ref>. See R. W. Quackenbush [9] for the history of a closely related and recently discovered concept of "term condition". We use the following notation. <p> This corollary was first proved for plane cubic curves by I. M. S. Etherington using the classical Bezout theorem (see [1]).
