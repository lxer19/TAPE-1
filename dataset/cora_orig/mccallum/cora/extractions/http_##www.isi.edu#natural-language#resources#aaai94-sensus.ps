The Ontology Base was built by Eduard Hovy, </title> <note> Licheng Zeng, </note> <author> Akitoshi Oku-mura, Richard Whitney, and Kevin Knight. </author> <title> Gratitude goes to Longman Group, Ltd., for making the machine readable version of LDOCE available to us, and to HarperCollins Publishers for letting us experiment with their bilingual dictionary. Louise Guthrie assisted in LDOCE/Collins extraction and kindly provided us with the LDOCE genus sense hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: The Upper Model <ref> (Bateman 1990) </ref> is a top-level network of about 200 nodes, implemented in the LOOM knowledge representation language (MacGregor 1988), and used by the PENMAN English generation system (Penman 1989) to drive its linguistic choices.

Reference-contexts: LDOCE has two fairly flat hierarchies. The hierarchy is induced by a set of 33 semantic codes drawn up by Longman lexicographers. Each sense is marked with one of these codes, e.g., "H" for human "P" for plant, "J" for movable object. The other hierarchy is the hierarchy. <ref> (Bruce & Guthrie 1992) </ref> have built an automatic algorithm for locating and disambiguating genus terms (head nouns) in sense definitions.

Reference-contexts: ONTOS Longman's Dictionary (LDOCE) WordNet Collins Bilingual Dictionary Definition Match Algorithm referring to that concept will have a particular set of default grammatical behaviors. Exceptions are coded in the lexicon. Of comparable size to the PENMAN Upper Model, ONTOS <ref> (Carlson & Nirenburg 1990) </ref> is a top-level ontology designed to support machine translation. The event structure is based on cross-linguistic studies of verbs, and case roles and filler restrictions are represented independently of any particular language. ON-TOS also includes object hierarchies, scalar attributes, and complex events.

Reference-contexts: WordNet groups synonymous word senses into single units ("synsets"). Noun senses are organized into a deep hierarchy, and the database also contains part-of links, antonym links, and others. Approximately half of WordNet synsets have brief informal definitions. The Harper-Collins Bilingual Spanish-English dictionary <ref> (Collins 1971) </ref> contains tens of thousands of Span-ish headwords and English translations. Like words in LDOCE definitions, word translations are not marked by sense, but they are sometimes annotated with subject field codes, such as Military [MIL] or Commercial [COM].

Reference-contexts: For example, if synonyms of WordNet sense appear in the definition of LDOCE sense , then this is evidence that and should be matched. The complete Definition Match algorithm is given in <ref> (Knight 1993) </ref>. Here we give a brief sketch. Given a word , we identify and stem all open-class content words from definitions and example sentences of in both dictionaries. We add to this set all synonyms, su-perordinates, siblings, and super-superordinates from all senses of in WordNet.
