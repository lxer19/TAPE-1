Abstract: Information can be represented in various media. Multimedia information systems may make use of audio, video, images, graphics, animations, and other types of media in addition to numbers and texts. While searching of multimedia databases often is based on searching of text descriptions, or involves vectors of features of the various representations, there are many new issues that must be faced when moving from text to a multiplicity of media. First, there is the problem of representation of each media type. There are special characteristics, and often requirements for large scale data compression. Second, there are issues related to coordinating and synchronizing the multiple media types. This relates to real time scheduling, network issues, and operating system support. Third, there are special computer systems (e.g., standalone systems like CD-TV or CD-I), new software/hardware technologies (e.g., DVI), and numerous standards (e.g., JPEG and MPEG for coding, HyTime for document architecture). These must be understood and related to given user requirements. Finally, there is need for methodologies for developing multimedia applications and for managing such projects. Here object-oriented methods are crucial, human-computer interaction guidelines must be followed, and new, useful metaphors and systems must be developed and refined. This Unit has three articles that should be studied. In addition, the videotape on Interactive Digital Video can be viewed in the Library. In the lecture a general overview will be given using KMS or Acrobat. Finally, demonstrations and videotapes will help round out the picture.
