Abstract: The purpose of this memo is to distinguish between the various meanings that digital painting may have. It is important to have a taxonomy so that intelligent conversation may proceed on such important issues as multi-resolution paint programs. Each type of painting will be discussed in its multi-resolution generalization. The taxonomy here splits painting into discrete and continuous categories and each of these into maxing and non-maxing subcategories. As usual in computer graphics, there are discrete and continuous versions of socalled painting , a digital technique originally intended to simulate the act of painting on canvas with a brush dipped in paint. The simplest version of painting, a discrete version, is nothing more than repeated compositing of an image called the brush , or paintbrush , with another image, often called the background image. The compositing (see [PorterDuff84]) repeats at every point taken from some input device such as a tablet stylus or mouse. If the brush is a single color and if the sampling of the input device is done often enough, then a stroke of paint appears to have been laid down over the background. The brush can have arbitrary shape and transparency. There are an infinity of variations of this type of painting obtained by performing an arbitrary image computation at all background pixels under the pixels of the brush in its current location. This kind of paint is the earliest realized (see [Smith78] for example) and is still used. For example, my 1993 product, Altamira Composer used this class of painting tools for its socalled touchup tools: paint, smear, erase, and clone, for example. It is the fortuitous overlapping of sequential brush copies that constitutes a stroke in this kind of painting. Absolutely any image can be used as a brush. Since this type of painting is defined at discrete points, using a discrete image, we shall call it discrete painting . A very different class of painting is defined continuously. A geometrically defined stroke is used that is constrained by the hand of the artist only at selected points, called control points , and is rendered between these points from the model of the strokea cylinder with a spline backbone, for example.

Paint Atop a sprite, for example, applies paint to the non-transparent pixels of the sprite only, Paint Over to all pixels. 3 Xfer and Clone are both pixel transfer operations under brush control.

Reference-contexts: A large class of painting effects that is not analyzed here are the socalled painterly effects that often attempt to simulate well-known real media affects such as brush hairs, directional painting, chalk, etc (e.g., see <ref> [Strassmann86] </ref>). These would probably have to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. I believe that some of the concepts described here might be useful for such further analysis.
