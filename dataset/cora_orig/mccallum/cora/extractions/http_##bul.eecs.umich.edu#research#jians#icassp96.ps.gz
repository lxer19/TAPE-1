Abstract: We present a new method for designing a transversal filter bank for parallel processing echo data in real-time active acoustic imaging. The method is based on a discretized linear spatio-temporal formulation of an imaging system which uses transmitter arrays with coded-excitation. The filter coefficients are derived from a pseudo-inverse operator which not only decouples echoes from different image lines, but also provides pulse compression along the range direction. The new method, together with the proposed coded-excitation imaging modality, may find many applications in SONAR, NDE and biomedical imaging areas.

INTRODUCTION Simultaneous acquisition and processing of a large number of image lines in real-time acoustic imaging can be achieved by using transmitter arrays with coded-excitation (or coded-aperture transducers) <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] </ref>. Ideally, this approach requires generating orthogonal coded wavefronts along different image lines. Thus the echo data can be processed in parallel through a matched filter bank. However, with finite-duration codes, the actual coded wavefronts along different image lines are correlated. <p> The method is based on a newly presented coded-excitation acoustic imaging modality capable of parallel processing multiple image lines <ref> [1, 4] </ref>. <p> However, with the RSI assumption, previous study results have shown that this cost can be significantly reduced since the P IO may be implemented by a transversal filter bank with each filter processing a distinct image line <ref> [1, 4] </ref>. In this report, a new design method is presented for achieving such a filter bank implementation. In this new approach, G is reformulated into a block cir-culant matrix [6, 7]. <p> The filter used for processing image line OE i can be defined as <ref> [1, 4] </ref> h i = [g i;N c (GG ) ] r i = 1; 2; : : : ; N OE ; (5) where g i;N c is the impulse response vector corresponding to the mid-range point on the i-th image line, the operator [] r maps a vector to <p> Each u m (or v m ), like a DFT basis vector, is defined by a single DFT frequency. Thus, (11) defines a filter calculation method very similar to the method used for finding Wiener PI filters <ref> [1] </ref>. If fi = 0, (11) produces an exact PI filter (h I a ) by inverting the sys tem frequency response over all the DFT frequencies (see the dotted line plot in Figure 2 (d)).
