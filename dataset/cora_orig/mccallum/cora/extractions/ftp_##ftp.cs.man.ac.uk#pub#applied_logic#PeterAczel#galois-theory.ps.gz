Title: Notes towards a formalisation of Constructive Galois Theory draft report  
Author: Peter Aczel 
Date: May 17, 1994  
Address: Manchester University  
Affiliation: Departments of Mathematics and Computer Science  
Abstract: We give a presentation of Constructive Galois Theory. This is intended, when completed, as a pre-formal blueprint for a machine checked formalisation and forms part of GALOIS, a long term experiment at an ambitious effort to formalise a significant body of abstract algebra.

Reference-contexts: So, other things being equal it has seemed natural to me to prefer constructive proofs over classical ones for Galois Theory. The most important source for a presentation of Constructive Galois Theory is [6]. Also, some parts are treated in <ref> [2] </ref>. An unexpected but interesting reference is [3]. This book aims to present Galois Theory in its historical context. The author has a constructive bias, which only becomes explicit in his presentation of the factorisation of polynomials, which requires more care in a constructive approach than in the classical ones.

The last part of the theorem can be proved as follows. That E : F is a Galois extension just uses characterisation (4) in Theorem 4.2. By characterisation (2) jG r4 j = jF 4 j = [E; F ] = jGj.
