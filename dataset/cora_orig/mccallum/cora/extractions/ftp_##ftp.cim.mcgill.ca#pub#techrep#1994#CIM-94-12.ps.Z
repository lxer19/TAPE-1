Reference-contexts: The report is organized as follows. In the remainder of this chapter we will review methods previously introduced [ 10 ] for extracting symmetry points using multi-scale annular operators. It will also be necessary to review the Medial Axis <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> as it will be referred to often during the remainder of the report. In the following chapter, the notion of parts will be introduced. The analysis will make a direct analogy between parts and symmetry point clusters which are defined based on a set of consistency constraints. <p> (modulo radians) is given by the `mean ori entation' of these line segments, represented by a faint arrow in the figure. 1.2 The Medial Axis There is a direct relationship between the symmetry points extracted using the annular sampling structure and the set of points that comprises the Medial Axis <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> . The Medial Axis (MA) and variants thereof have been used extensively in the past by computer vision researchers to represent some of the symmetries present in two-dimensional objects. <p> The Medial Axis Transform (MAT) was introduced by Blum as a way to generate axes from any closed two-dimensional contours <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> . For any simple closed curve it is always possible to identify an interior region which is bounded by the curve. <p> In the following section we will consider the kinds of representations that are likely to be most useful for describing blob and limb parts. 2.5 Part Representations As introduced previously (see Section 1.2), the Medial Axis (MA) <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> is well established as a means for representing the regional structure of two-dimensional shapes. Due to its evident descriptive power in providing region-based representations, we have chosen to devise a part representation based upon a structure similar to the MA.

Reference-contexts: In fact, the set of points extracted by the annular sampling scheme bears a close resemblance to the set of Smoothed Local Symmetry (SLS) curves introduced by Brady <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> fl . We note that in many cases the MA is a subset of the SLS set [ 18 ] . The additional symmetries that SLS captures result from multiple circular tangencies which occur when `operators' fall outside of the contour (see Figure 1.5).

When detecting large-scale symmetric structures, it is important that the edges derived from small-scale structures be discarded so that symmetry point clusters do not become too complex. We employ two forms of filtering for this.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Annular operators have been previously introduced <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> [ 11 ] as a means of extracting symmetry information from gray-scale images. The extraction process can be described in two stages. First contrast edges are identified within an image at multiple scales. Then the edges are grouped using annular operators also applied at multiple scales. <p> It will be shown that it is possible to extract usable representations for object structures in images from raw symmetry data. The report is organized as follows. In the remainder of this chapter we will review methods previously introduced <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> for extracting symmetry points using multi-scale annular operators. It will also be necessary to review the Medial Axis [ 1 ] as it will be referred to often during the remainder of the report. In the following chapter, the notion of parts will be introduced. <p> final chapter presents experimental results which validate the theory described in previous chapters, and demonstrates the performance of an automatic system which is capable of extracting part representations. 1.1 Background The extraction of symmetry information from images using annular shaped operators has been introduced elsewhere (the reader is referred to <ref> [ 10 ] </ref>[ 11 ] for a more detailed description of what follows). The application of these operators leads to the identification of symmetrically enclosed points which distinguish the spatial positions of symmetries existing between edges in an image. <p> The result of the edge extraction process is a set of edge maps. Orientation and magnitude (contrast) values are recorded at points in the edge map where edges are marked. The multi-scale annular sampling structure has been discussed at length elsewhere <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> . 5 It consists of a set of N layers, each of which contains a set of annular operators, all of the same size. As a set of layers is traversed, the size of the annuli increases in order that larger scale edge structures can be detected. <p> It is possible to represent the annular sampling space in similar continuous terms, as shown in Figure 1.4. In this case, the scale parameter s corresponds to the size of the annulus used. Recall that a set of layers is employed in the annular sampling structure <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> . As shown in the figure, these represent a discrete scalar sampling of the continuous space. parameters x and y, and a scale parameter s which relates to the size of annular operators used. In our implementation, a discrete number of layers is used. <p> In our implementation, a discrete number of layers is used. This may be viewed as slices taken through the space at a discrete number of positions along the scale axis. The fixed operator size used within each layer must be chosen to fall somewhere within a specific continuous range <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> . Each annulus in a given layer is defined by an inner and outer circular boundary, having radii r 1 and r 2 , respectively. <p> Of course, the above discussion dealt with hypothetical operators. When employing real annular operators having a finite (nonzero) width, the result will contain many additional points not included in the MA. This is due to sampling redundancies <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> . If it were feasible to identify which of these symmetrically enclosed points coincided with the MA, then it would be possible to directly obtain a useful shape representation for the contour from this set. <p> From these points we would then like to extract part representations that are similar in structure to the MA. When using annular operators to detect symmetrically enclosed points, we find that certain sampling redundancies <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> result in groups of symmetry points being generated. For example, the result for a single circular (idealized) blob contour would be a set of symmetry points distributed within one of the sampling layers, with additional symmetry points also being found in adjacent layers. <p> However, in any practical situation, we note that redundancies invariably arise. For example, intra-layer redundancy even occurs when a single circle is detected by multiple operators within a single scale or layer <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> . The amount of intra-layer redundancy increases proportionally with the width of the annulus, and this is controlled by the parameter = r 2 r 1 . <p> We note that the symmetry volume becomes wider at higher scales since the amount of redundancy (and hence broadening) increases with scale. 2.2.1 Blobs The idealized blob is represented by a circle (see Section 2.1). As demonstrated in <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> , intra-layer redundancy will cause several operators within at least one layer to respond to a single circular contour. <p> To detect a circle of radius r by a given annular operator requires that it fall entirely within the annular region. Hence, a fundamental constraint is that r 1 r r 2 . In <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> it was demonstrated that for a given annular region, the range of positions for detectable circles falls within a circular region which is concentric with the annulus (see Figure 2.6). <p> It is evident that the centers of all detectable circles of the same size will fall within a circular region that is concentric with the annulus (light shaded). radius fi can be represented by the following expression <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> : fi (r) = &gt; &lt; r r 1 if r 1 r r avg 0 otherwise (2:1) Here, r avg = r 1 +r 2 2 represents the average detectable radius value for an annulus. <p> All such intersections will be concentric, and thus a set of these taken from several adjacent layers will appear as a concentric circles (see Figure 2.15). The existence of this `stack' of circular envelopes is a direct result of the inter-layer redundancy which was discussed at length in <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> . By appropriately selecting the amount of inter-layer redundancy, it is possible to ensure that some minimum number of layers (greater than one) always intersects the circle's symmetry volume. <p> We begin by discussing how symmetry points are identified and assigned an orientation value. After a brief review of some definitions presented in our previous work on annular sampling <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> , it will examine how part representations may be extracted from symmetry data. This will require that the continuity constraints introduced in the previous chapter (see Section 2.4) be re-examined in order to see how they can be applied to the discretely sampled symmetry data. <p> Before examining the next grouping stage in detail, we review the annular sampling scheme that has been described in previous work <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> . 3.2 Sampling Definitions: A Review The analogy between discrete sampling and slices taken parallel to the x y plane in the continuous scale-space has already been made (see Section 1.2). <p> The set of scale values S = fs 1 ; s 2 ; s 3 ; :::s N g defines a sequence in which the scale increases as the set is traversed from s 1 to s N . In a previous report <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> , the set of parameters used to specify the annular sampling structure was defined. <p> We will begin by defining the neighborhoods used to define adjacency between points. Such adjacencies within the discretely sampled S-space are the basis for ensuring continuity within symmetry point clusters. We recall that a hexagonal neighborhood is employed during annular sampling within each layer <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> , so that each point p i has six neighbors N 0 i = fg 1 ; g 2 ; :::g 6 g which all fall 41 within layer l k = L (p i ). <p> The details describing how this is implemented are presented in what follows. To guarantee that symmetry points exist within at least two adjacent layers for any given blob enclosure, we need to ensure that there is adequate inter-layer redundancy. The sampling structure outlined in <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> was configured so that circles having arbitrary position and size (within some bounded range) could be detected by at least one operator. We can extend this requirement to ensure that operators in at least two different layers will respond 43 central axis for these distributions. <p> In <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> we chose a sampling strategy that produced no overlap between the restricted ranges of operators in adjacent layers. For scale continuity between two adjacent layers i and i + 1, the restricted range bounds, r min and r max , were defined (see [ 10 ] equation (2.10)) <p> In <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> we chose a sampling strategy that produced no overlap between the restricted ranges of operators in adjacent layers. For scale continuity between two adjacent layers i and i + 1, the restricted range bounds, r min and r max , were defined (see [ 10 ] equation (2.10)) by: r i min (3:7) Since we would like to ensure that at least two layers respond to a given circle, we require that there be at least 50% overlap between the restricted ranges of operators in adjacent layers, resulting in the following equation: r i <p> From <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> we recall that, based on equation (3.7), the layer spacing parameter was expressed as: = 3* + 1 3* + 1 Therefore the revised expression for based upon the 50% overlap indicated in equation (3.8) is given by: = 3 ) (3:10) 44 As we would expect, for <p> One final set of examples will be used to illustrate the variations which arise due to different annular sampling parameters. From Section 3.2 we recall that there are three parameters (, *, and ) which specify the annular sampling structure <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> fl . We have observed in one previous example, how a variation in the parameter * has the effect of changing the spatial resolution of extracted symmetry points (see Figure 4.3). Higher values of * correspond to a larger ratio between annular size and annular spacing. <p> cases the range of orientations covers two or three quantization levels. (b) For a larger value of D max = 45 ffi , more symmetry points are found and the range of orientations is generally greater than for the same points found in (a). ship is discussed at length in <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> . Having employed several binary images to demonstrate the symmetry point distributions for limbs, we now turn to examples of gray-scale imagery. It will become clear that, while the symmetry point distributions are generally more complex, it will still be possible to identify characteristic limb clusters.

The extraction process can be described in two stages. First contrast edges are identified within an image at multiple scales.

Two different types of symmetrically enclosing structures have been considered [ 11 ] . Blob enclosures are characterized by a set of edge contours which largely surround the central annular region without preference to direction. <p> Break angles are computed, and based on these, a measure of symmetric enclosure may then be computed <ref> [ 11 ] </ref> (see Section 3.2.1). Two different types of symmetrically enclosing structures have been considered [ 11 ] . Blob enclosures are characterized by a set of edge contours which largely surround the central annular region without preference to direction. In contrast, limb enclosure is characterized by a pair of enclosing contours having one or more distinct gaps. <p> A blob part consists of a set of contours that have an approximately circular shape and that fall within the band of at least one annular operator. As discussed in <ref> [ 11 ] </ref> the contour need not be spatially continuous; however, the degree of surroundedness must be high (see segments falls within the band of an annular operator such that the inner circular region is surrounded or enclosed by the contour. The entire contour configuration constitutes a blob part. tion. <p> As with the blob part, the term limb part refers to a set of edges which have a particular spatial configuration that leads to symmetrically enclosed points. We note that such enclosure occurs when large gaps are present in the angular profile <ref> [ 11 ] </ref> associated with a given annular operator (see Figure 2.2). Since all relevant symmetry information is captured by limb part. An annular operators (shaded) whose center is located near the contour's Medial Axis (dashed) will detect symmetric limb enclosures. <p> To introduce the concept of limb orientation, we first consider the following simple example. The orientation of a symmetrically enclosed limb point is determined by examining the annular angular profile (see <ref> [ 11 ] </ref> for an introduction to angular or `scan' profiles). In general, we will assume that a configuration of edges exhibiting limb enclosure will have at least one (usually two) predominant break (s) in its angular profile. <p> To begin, we consider one important constraint that will allow us to formulate a simple method for detecting oriented limb enclosure. Consider the set of break angles <ref> [ 11 ] </ref> f 1 ; 2 ; ::: n g found for a given angular profile (see Figure 3.7). These represent an ordered sequence of decreasing values starting with the largest, 1 . <p> By assigning the values f 1 ; 2 ; ::: n g to the n break angles found in the angular profile of a given operator (see Section 3.1 above), the degree of enclosure e <ref> [ 11 ] </ref> may be quantified as follows: e = 1 2 2 i=1 There is an associated enclosure value e i for each of the M symmetry points p i extracted from an image.

Reference-contexts: In the second, other small scale edges are suppressed by a nonlinearity which requires that all valid edges have full support along an operator's major axis. Details pertaining to the method used for edge extraction are discussed in <ref> [ 12 ] </ref> . The extraction of multi-scale edge features is shown in Figure 1.1. Elongated edge operators are applied at locations throughout the original image over a range of orientations. Six different scales are shown here, each employing a different sized edge operator.

Reference-contexts: Which points are used to construct the approximating path will depend upon how close they are with respect to the symmetry axis. It is possible to construct a set of Voronoi cells (referring to 57 the regions enclosed by Voronoi polygons <ref> [ 17 ] </ref> ) for the set of sampling points each of which represents a region of influence for the point located at its center. For all points located within a Voronoi cell, we know that the closest grid point is the one located at the center of the cell.

Furthermore, the search method provides more flexibility in terms of implementing the path constraints (see Section 3.5.2). We note that other parallel methods or neural networks <ref> [ 21 ] </ref> could be employed so that distances are propagated through a graph using nonlinear decisions at each node. Although these would provide a more elegant implementation, we have chosen to stay with the more `brute force' approach.
