Reference-contexts: Since the objective function and the constraints are both linear functions of the variables, x [food], this problem is a linear program. The Diet Problem formulation page continues this derivation to show a more mathematical formulation and the AMPL modeling language <ref> [1] </ref> formulation so that we can solve the problem by using a computer. The optimal solution for our small sample problem is shown here.
