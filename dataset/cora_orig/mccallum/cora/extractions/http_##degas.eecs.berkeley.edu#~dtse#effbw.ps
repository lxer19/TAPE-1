Abstract: To meet the increasing capacity demand on wireless networks, there have been intense efforts in the past decade on developing multi-user receiver structures which mitigate the interference between users in spread-spectrum and antenna array systems. While much of the research is performed at the physical layer, the capacity of networks with multiuser receivers and the associated power control problems are less well-understood. In this paper, we show that under some conditions, the capacity of a single power-controlled cell for several important receivers can be very simply characterized via a notion of effective bandwidth: the quality-of-service requirements of all the users can be met if and only if the sum of the effective bandwidths of the users is less than the total number of degrees of freedom in the system. The number of degrees of freedom is the processing gain in a spread-spectrum system and the number of antenna elements in an antenna array. The effective bandwidth of a user depends only on its own requirement, expressed in terms of the desired signal-to-interference ratio. Simple effective bandwidth expressions are derived for three linear receivers: the conventional matched filter, the decorrelator and the MMSE receiver. The effective bandwidths under the three receivers serve as a basis for performance comparison. fl Submitted to IEEE Trans. on Information Theory.

Reference-contexts: For example, the effect of an individual interferer on the SIR for user 1 cannot be seen directly from this formula. In practice, it is often reasonable to assume that the spreading sequences are randomly and independently chosen. (See eg. <ref> [11, 3] </ref>.) For example, they may be pseudorandom sequences, or the users choose their sequences from a large set of available sequences as they are admitted into the network.

Reference-contexts: In practice, this means that the change in the spreading sequences is at a much slower time-scale than the symbol rate so that the receiver has the 5 time to acquire the sequences. (There are known adaptive algorithms for which this can even be done blindly; see <ref> [6] </ref>.) However, the performance of the MMSE receiver depends on the initial choice of the sequences and hence random. The model for random sequences: let s i = 1 p L (V i1 ; : : : ; V iL ) , i=1, : : : M.

Results for three receivers are obtained. They are the minimum mean-square (MMSE) receiver [23, 10, 13, 14]), the decorrelator <ref> [8, 9] </ref>, and the conventional matched filter receiver. We 2 will show that the effective bandwidths are respectively: e mmse (fi) = fi e dec (fi) = 1 e mf (fi) = fi; where fi is the SIR requirement of the user. <p> It is also illuminating to compare its performance with that of the decorrelator. The decorrelator was in fact the first linear "multi-user detector" introduced by Lu-pas and Verdu <ref> [8] </ref>. This receiver is known to be optimal in the worst case scenario in which interferers' powers tend to infinity; its near-far resistance is optimal [9].

Its main shortcoming, as we will see, is that each user has an effective bandwidth of 1 degree of freedom, which can be wasteful when the SIR of the user is small. On the other hand, it is hardly wasteful when the SIR is large.

This is the well-known near-far resistance property of the MMSE receiver <ref> [10] </ref>. The intuition is that as the power of an interferer grows to infinity, the MMSE receiver will null out its signal. <p> Since this does not depend on the background noise power 2 , this is also the asymptotic efficiency. It is well known <ref> [10] </ref> that the MMSE receiver has the same asymptotic efficiency as the decorrelator, and hence the decorrelator is optimal in this sense among all linear receivers.

Reference-contexts: While the above provides a rigorous proof, it provides little intuition as why Theorem 3.1 is true. In particular, a better understanding of the decoupling phenomenon between interferers is desired. Based on some new results obtained in <ref> [21] </ref>, we provide a heuristic but more intuitive derivation of formula (4) in Appendix A, bypassing the mysterious Steltjes transform characterization of the limiting eigenvalue distribution of random matrices in (10) and only basing ourselves on Lemma 4.3. 5 Capacity and Performance under Power Control We observed in Section 3 that <p> The above capacity results are derived in the context of random spreading sequences. A natural question to ask is whether one can get performance gain if we could optimize the choice of the sequences. In <ref> [21] </ref>, it is shown that even with the optimal choice of sequences, the capacity (without power constraint) under the MMSE receiver is still 1 + 1 fi fl users per degree of freedom.

These results should be compared with that of Winters et. al. <ref> [22] </ref>, which showed that for a flat Rayleigh fading channel, a combiner which attempts to null out all the interferers will cost one degree of freedom per interferer.
