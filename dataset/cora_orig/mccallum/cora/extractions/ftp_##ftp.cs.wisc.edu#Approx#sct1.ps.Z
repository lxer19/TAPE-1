Author: Amos Ron 
Keyword: Key Words and phrases: approximation order, Strang-Fix conditions, scattered shifts, radial basis functions, localization of splines.

Abstract: Approximation by scattered shifts f( ff)g ff2A of a basis function are considered, and different methods for localizing these translates are compared. It is argued in the note that the superior localization processes are those that employ the original translates only.

Reference-contexts: A beautiful concrete example for the above abstract discussion exists in box spline theory. We outline here the box spline situation and refer the reader to [RS] and the references therein for more details. We take the original "universally acceptable" function to be the truncated power function, <ref> [D] </ref>, whose Fourier transform has the form b (!) = ~2ffi 3 where ffi is a finite collection of non-zero vectors in IR d which we assume here to be integers.

Reference-contexts: Even when A is finite, a localization procedure can help improve the stability of the evaluation process of the approximant (cf. <ref> [DL] </ref> and [DLR]). There are several different approaches for extending the idea of "localization then approximation" from the uniform case to the scattered case, and we describe below two essentially different approaches, whose comparison is important here.

Reference-contexts: We further assume that the initial space of approximants we start with is refined by dilation (this is stationary refinement, cf. e.g., <ref> [R] </ref>). Under such (and even milder) assumptions, the approximation properties of our space (measured asymptotically by the criterion of approximation orders) is known to be controlled by the so-called Strang-Fix conditions ([SF], [BR], [BDR]). <p> if the following three conditions hold (a) b has a high order singularity at 0 (forcing b T to have a high order zero there) (b) b is not too singular on 2ZZ d n0 (for radial functions the origin is assumed to be the only point of singularity, cf. <ref> [R] </ref>) and (c) the high order zero b T has at the origin is projected on each of the points of 2ZZ d n0.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the use of truly irregular sets A results at 0 approximation order, and thus using scattered translates of the B-spline should be avoided. In contrast, we remind the reader of the classical fact (cf. e.g., <ref> [S] </ref>) that, for (x) := x n1 + , the functions in A () can be easily localized by Method A to obtain the standard n-order B-splines that correspond to the knot sequence A, and these B-splines yield approximation order n.
