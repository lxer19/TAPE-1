Reference-contexts: Tournament selection pressure is increased (decreased) by simply increasing (decreasing) the tournament size. All of these factors have contributed to the increased usage of tournament selection as a selection mechanism for GAs. Good progress was made some time ago <ref> (Goldberg and Deb, 1991) </ref> in understanding the convergence rates of various selection schemes, including tournament selection. Recently, building on work by Muhlenbein and Schlierkamp-Voosen (1993), this understanding has been refined to better understand the timing and degree of convergence more accurately (Thierens and Goldberg, 1994).

Reference-contexts: The convergence rate of a GA is largely determined by the selection pressure, with higher selection pressures resulting in higher convergence rates. Genetic algorithms are able to to identify optimal or near-optimal solutions under a wide range of selection pressure <ref> (Goldberg, Deb, and Thierens, 1993) </ref>. However, if the selection pressure is too low, the convergence rate will be slow, and the GA will unnecessarily take longer to find the optimal solution.

Reference-contexts: Table 1 gives the values for the mean of the maximal order statistic for n = f2; 3; 4; 5g (see Balakrishnan and Cohen (1991) for derivations). For larger values of n, the means of the order statistics for the standard normal distribution have been tabulated extensively <ref> (Harter, 1961) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Good progress was made some time ago (Goldberg and Deb, 1991) in understanding the convergence rates of various selection schemes, including tournament selection. Recently, building on work by Muhlenbein and Schlierkamp-Voosen (1993), this understanding has been refined to better understand the timing and degree of convergence more accurately <ref> (Thierens and Goldberg, 1994) </ref>. Despite this progress, this detailed timing and degree of convergence analysis has not yet been extended to tournaments other than binary (s = 2); nor has the analysis been applied to domains other than deterministic ones. In this paper, we do these two things. <p> From Equation 2, it is also apparent that the change in fitness between generations is given by: F;t = F;t+1 F;t ; For binary tournaments (s = 2), this matches the result obtained in <ref> (Thierens and Goldberg, 1994) </ref>, where the expected increase in the average population fitness for tournaments of size s = 2 was derived in a different manner using the difference between normal distributions. Their result, using the notation in this paper, was F;t+1 = F;t + F;t . <p> While the predictive model slightly overestimates the performance of GAs using one crossover (figure 1a), it accurately estimates the performance of the experiments using two crossovers (figure 1b). This is a result of crossover decreasing the correlation between alleles <ref> (Thierens and Goldberg, 1994) </ref>, and the tendency of crossover to `normalize' the population fitness distributions, making our model assumption of a normal population distribution more accurate. <p> As done in Thierens and Goldberg (1994), we perform two crossovers per generation in our experiments, so after the usual procedure of tournament selection and recombination, we randomly shu*e the population and again recombine the population using crossover. This has the beneficial effects of reducing the correlation between alleles <ref> (Thierens and Goldberg, 1994) </ref>, and `normalizing' the population fitness distribution. However, for domains characterized by high allele interaction, this could reduce the overall performance of the GA, as there would be a higher disruption rate for the evolving building blocks. variance is zero, for a variety of tournament sizes.
