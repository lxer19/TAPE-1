Reference-contexts: a set of restrictors R 1 ; : : : ; R k is defined to be a string (* 1 ; : : : ; * k ), where * i = 0 (resp. * i = 1) if c is balanced (resp. unbalanced) on R i (i 2 <ref> [1; k] </ref>). Obviously, the balanced colorings of V are colorings of type 0 with respect to restrictor R = V . <p> Thus, m 9 (4) 21. However, it is also not hard to prove that for any 21 quadruples q 1 ; : : : ; q 21 , some of the sets B (q i ) (i 2 <ref> [1; 21] </ref>) overlap, implying m 9 (4) 22. Clearly, the increase in the number of quadruples can only increase the number of overlapping pairs of sets B (q). The gist of the difficulties posed by even this special case of the m (n)-problem is in evaluating multiple overlappings. <p> on the size of their intersection only, as the table below shows: jq 1 " q 2 j = 0 1 2 3 Table 2 A type of a [9,4]-design is defined through an auxiliary graph A = (Q; E), where Q is the set of quadruples of V = <ref> [0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8] </ref>, and E = f (q 1 ; q 2 ) : q 1 ; q 2 2 Q & jq 1 " q 2 j = 0 or 3:g One might expect that a minimal [9,4]-design comprises relatively small components, with many

Reference-contexts: The best bounds for m 9 (4) were obtained by Abbott and Liu in <ref> [2] </ref> who proved 24 m 9 (4) 26. For a more complete history of the subject, see [11]. 2 Approach The problem of computing m v (n) can be reformulated as that of constructing a minimum dominating set 2 in a special bipartite graph defined as follows. <p> on the size of their intersection only, as the table below shows: jq 1 " q 2 j = 0 1 2 3 Table 2 A type of a [9,4]-design is defined through an auxiliary graph A = (Q; E), where Q is the set of quadruples of V = <ref> [0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8] </ref>, and E = f (q 1 ; q 2 ) : q 1 ; q 2 2 Q & jq 1 " q 2 j = 0 or 3:g One might expect that a minimal [9,4]-design comprises relatively small components, with many

Reference-contexts: achieved independently by Seymour [12] and Toft [14]; their constructions 1 are modifications of that by Abbot and Hanson ([1]). fl The work of this author was supported in part by NSF Grant #CCR-9214487; goldberg@cs.rpi.edu. 1 The designs are isomorphic; it was established by using the software package SetPlayer (see <ref> [3] </ref>). 1 0 3 4 Erdos showed in [6] that m 2n1 (n) = m 2n (n) = 2n1 , and noticed "I cannot compute m 2n+1 (n) and in fact do not know the value of m 9 (4)." The problem of computing m 9 (4) is still open. <p> on the size of their intersection only, as the table below shows: jq 1 " q 2 j = 0 1 2 3 Table 2 A type of a [9,4]-design is defined through an auxiliary graph A = (Q; E), where Q is the set of quadruples of V = <ref> [0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8] </ref>, and E = f (q 1 ; q 2 ) : q 1 ; q 2 2 Q & jq 1 " q 2 j = 0 or 3:g One might expect that a minimal [9,4]-design comprises relatively small components, with many
