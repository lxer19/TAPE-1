Title: A Reliable, Adaptive Network Protocol for Video Transport  
Author: Pawan Goyal Harrick M. Vin Chia Shen and Prshant Shenoy 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a reliable, adaptive credit-based network protocol for video transport. To do so, we first derive a sufficient condition for ensuring the reliability of the receiver-based adaptive buffer allocation algorithm. We then present a fair buffer adaptation algorithm that ensures uniform increase in the delays experienced by the application protocol data units of bursty flows during congestion. The adaptive buffer allocation algorithm is then tuned to minimize the end-to-end delay and jitter for VBR encoded video streams. Although such a protocol does not provide delay or delay jitter guarantees, we demonstrate that due to the inherent nature of our algorithm, the network, rather than the source, shapes the traffic, which in turn yields smaller end-to-end delay for video frames as compared to source traffic shaping algorithms. On the other hand, to mask the effects of delay jitter on playback continuity, we present a simple technique for adapting the playback point at client sites. We experimentally evaluate the adaptive buffer allocation algorithm for a wide range of parameters and many network configuration and demonstrate it's adaptability and suitability for video transport.

A fundamental limitation of all of these techniques is that most traffic specification models are inadequate for accurately characterizing video traffic.

An interested reader may obtain a detailed description of the protocol in [8]. 4 For each flow f , the sender maintains two values: (1) a transmit count t f , which denotes the number of packets transmitted for flow f , and (2) a credit balance cb f , which indicates the buffer availability for the flow at the receiver. <p> As described in <ref> [8] </ref>, at any instant, the buffer allocation for a flow at the receiver can be partitioned as a f = (n 2 + n 3 ). <p> The buffer requirement for the adaptive algorithm, on the other hand, scales linearly with propagation delay. Consequently, in a LAN environment, the buffer size requirement reduces significantly. 5 Comparison with Kung's Receiver-Oriented Adaptation Algorithm The concept of receiver-oriented adaptation was originally introduced in <ref> [8] </ref>, and a particular algorithm was proposed in [9]. In what follows, we point out the limitations of the algorithm proposed in [9]: * The algorithm presented in [9] requires a very strong condition to be true so as to ensure that no packet loss would occur during reallocation.
