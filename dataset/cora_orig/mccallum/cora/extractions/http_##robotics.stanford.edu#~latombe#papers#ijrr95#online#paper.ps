Title: On-Line Manipulation Planning for Two Robot Arms in a Dynamic Environment

Note: To appear in the International Journal  
Abstract: In a constantly changing and partially unpredictable environment, robot motion planning must be on-line. The planner receives a continuous flow of information about occurring events and generates new plans, while previously planned motions are being executed. This paper describes an on-line planner for two cooperating arms whose task is to grab parts of various types on a conveyor belt and transfer them to their respective goals while avoiding collision with obstacles. Parts arrive on the belt in random order, at any time. Both goals and obstacles may be dynamically changed. This scenario is typical of manufacturing cells serving machine-tools, assembling products, or packaging objects. The proposed approach breaks the overall planning problem into subproblems, each involving a low-dimensional configuration or configurationfitime space, and orchestrates very fast primitives solving these subproblems. The resulting planner has been implemented and extensively tested in a simulated environment, as well as with a real dual-arm system. Its competitiveness has been evaluated against an oracle making (almost) the best decision at any one time; the results show that the planner compares extremely well.

Reference-contexts: The arms must grab parts as they arrive on the belt and transfer them to specified goals on the table where, for example, they will form one or several assembled products. The robot system is depicted in Fig. 1. It consists of two identical scara-type arms <ref> [7] </ref>, each having three links and four degrees of freedom. The first two links of each arm form a horizontal 4 linkage with two revolute joints. The third link, which carries the gripper, translates up and down. Finally, the gripper can rotate about its vertical axis.

Characteristic arrangements of LEDs are mounted on all objects of interest (arriving parts and obstacles); the overhead vision system senses these LEDs, identifies their arrangements, and computes the positions of the objects in real time.

Reference-contexts: This software is integrated under ControlShell, which provides object-oriented tools for combining software components developed separately [1]. The five modules are implemented on several computers and communicate through a subscription-based network data sharing system called the Network Data Delivery Service (NDDS) <ref> [30] </ref>. In the current implementation, the user interface and the planner run on two different UNIX workstations, while the control and vision modules run on several VME-based real-time processors.

Reference-contexts: This kind of improvement could benefit the planner even when the belt's velocity is nominal. 9 Connection to Robotic System System description: We have connected our planner with the dual-arm robotic system shown in Figure 5, which has been developed in the Aerospace Robotics Laboratory at Stanford <ref> [31] </ref>. The integrated system comprises five major modules: the user interface, the on-line manipulation planner, the dual-arm robot control system, the real-time vision system, and the graphic simula 26 tor [28, 29].

Reference-contexts: The planner in [6] is used to check for the maintainability of aircraft engines. Motion planning in the presence of obstacles moving along known trajectories is a step toward dealing with a dynamic environment. It has been studied in particular in <ref> [10, 11, 32, 33] </ref>, where previous path planning methods have been extended to deal with the temporal aspect of this new problem. Motion plans are generated in the form of robot's trajectories, i.e., geometric paths indexed by time.

Reference-contexts: Manipulation planning has been studied for a single robot in [2, 35] and for multiple robots in [17, 18, 19, 20]. The regrasping issue with one robot has been specifically investigated in <ref> [34] </ref>. Contribution of this paper: We believe that our planner is the first on-line planner able to solve complicated manipulation planning problems in a dynamic environment. This planner was implemented, connected to real robots, and applied to a practical scenario. Our experimental results are extremely satisfactory.
