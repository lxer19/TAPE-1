Reference-contexts: We say that fF k (u)g and ff k (u)g are inverse sequences. There are several solutions to the q-Lagrange inversion problem appearing in the literature | see for example Andrews <ref> [2] </ref>, Garsia [7], Garsia and Remmel [9], Gessel [10], Gessel and Stanton [11][12], Hofbauer [13], Krattenthaler [15], Singer [17][18]. Singer [17] proved an inversion theorem, based on a generalization of Garsia's operator techniques, which unifies and extends the q-Lagrange inversion theorems of Garsia [7] and Garsia-Remmel [9].

Reference-contexts: Garsia, Gessel and Stanton, and Singer have shown that Rogers-Ramanujan type identities may be derived by means of q-Lagrange inversion. Several authors have given quite distinct bijective proofs of q-series identities, many of which may be interpreted as statements about partitions see Andrews [1][3], Bressoud <ref> [4] </ref>, Garsia and Milne [8], Joichi and Stanton [14], Sylvester [19]. An exceptional example is Garsia and Milne's proof of the Rogers-Ramanujan identities [16], making use of the involution principle. Bressoud and Zeilberger gave an alternative, much shorter proof of these identities in [5].

In view of the fact that so many q-series identities may be derived by means of q-Lagrange inversion as well as by bijective methods, it is desirable to have a combinatorial interpretation of the inverse relations (1.1) and (1.2).
