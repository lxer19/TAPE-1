Abstract: In this paper we consider the following problem in computational geometry which has applications in VLSI floorplan design and image processing. Given an orthogonal polygon P (i.e. edges are either vertical or horizontal) with n vertices and a positive integer m &lt; n, determine an orthogonal polygon Q with less than or equal to m vertices such that ERROR(P; Q) is minimized, where ERROR(P; Q) is defined as the area of the symmetric difference of the interiors of the two polygons. We present a polynomial time optimal algorithm to solve this problem for convex orthogonal polygons. Our algorithm is based on a transformation of the polygon approximation problem into a constrained shortest path problem.

Reference-contexts: This problem has applications in VLSI floorplan design and image processing. (For example, the shape curve pruning problem <ref> [1] </ref> in VLSI circuit layout can be formulated as a polygon approximation problem. As for image processing [2], algorithms for approximating polygons can be used for image data compression.
