Abstract: This paper presents algorithms and lower bounds for several fundamental problems on the Exclusive Read, Concurrent Write Parallel Random Access Machine (ERCW PRAM) and some results for unbounded fan-in, bounded fan-out (or `BFO') circuits. Our results for these two models are of importance because of the close relationship of the ERCW model to the OCPC model, a model of parallel computing based on dynamically reconfigurable optical networks, and of BFO circuits to the OCPC model with limited dynamic reconfiguration ability.

Reference-contexts: In the next two subsections, we describe some less obvious simulation results. 8.1 Separations In our lower bounds, we will always assume the simulating machine has infinite memory. Boppana <ref> [9] </ref> showed that solving Element Distinctness on the Common CRCW PRAM (and thus the Common ERCW (ack) PRAM) requires (log n= log log n) time. However on any of the other ERCW (ack) PRAM models, Element Distinctness can be solved in constant time. The following theorem follows.

A BFO circuit with size s and depth d can be simulated in a straightforward way by an s processor, d step oblivious OCPC algorithm.

Reference-contexts: We assume standard definitions for circuits and formulas [10]. A BFO circuit with size s and depth d can be simulated in a straightforward way by an s processor, d step oblivious OCPC algorithm. Just as unbounded fan-in, unbounded fan-out circuits correspond closely to the CRCW PRAM <ref> [11] </ref>, and the study of bounded fan-in circuits often sheds light on algorithms for the CREW and EREW PRAM, we believe that the study of BFO circuits should enhance the understanding of the ERCW PRAMs We now give some results on solving some fundamental problems on BFO circuits. 7.1 Lower Bounds

Reference-contexts: This separation is tight for the CRCW PRAM, but so far the best algorithm for Element Distinct- ness on the Common ERCW (ack) PRAM requires (log n) time. Similarly, Grolmusz and Ragde [34] and Chaudhuri <ref> [12] </ref> provide separations between some other CRCW PRAM models, which can be easily transferred to the ERCW (ack) PRAM, yielding the following theorem.

Reference-contexts: ERCW (ack) PRAM model, and a separation of (log log n) between the Tolerant ERCW (ack) PRAM model and the Collision ERCW (ack) PRAM model. 8.2 Simulations First we note that the simulation of a Priority (m) CRCW PRAM on an Arbitrary (mn) CRCW PRAM. given in Chlebus et al. <ref> [15] </ref> can be easily transferred to the ERCW (ack) PRAM, yielding the following theorem. Theorem 8.3 There is a simulation of a Priority (m) ERCW (ack) PRAM on an Arbitrary (mn) ERCW (ack) PRAM that runs in O (log log n) steps. <p> The rest of this subsection describes the simulation of an Arbitrary (m) ERCW (ack) PRAM on a Tolerant (mn) ERCW (ack) PRAM. For the simulation we need to use a partition algorithm from <ref> [15] </ref>, which is run with a subset of processors, and results in either one processor being marked, or at least one but at most half of the processors being marked. This partition algorithm uses O (n) memory cells and takes O (log log n) time.

Reference-contexts: Then if there is more than a single processor remaining in a group, each of the remaining processors will be assigned 2 p processors. In the second phase of our simulation, we use a technique from <ref> [16] </ref> to choose one of the remaining (marked) processors for each cell as follows. Let k = 2 p log n= log log n . Assign each marked processor to a cell in an n element array according to its processor number. Form a k-ary tree T over this array.

Reference-contexts: Our construction makes use of an optimal logarithmic depth circuit for computing (in binary) the sum of n bits [46] and two constructions for monotone formulas due to Valiant [49] and Friedman <ref> [27] </ref> which we sketch below. 20 The monotone formula construction of Valiant [49] shows that any monotone symmetric function on n variables can be written as a monotone formula of size O (n 5:3 ). <p> Implicit in the construction of this formula is a monotone BFO circuit of size O (n 5:3 ) and depth O (log n). The monotone formula construction of Friedman <ref> [27] </ref> shows that T H k;n can be written as a monotone formula of size O (k 12:6 n log n). This construction uses Valiant's construction on threshold functions with 4k 2 inputs, and thus has depth O (log k).

Reference-contexts: Research on routing in general fiber optic networks can be found in [1]. In this paper, however, we are only concerned with a specific type of fiber optic network, namely the Passive optical star coupler network <ref> [6, 7, 20, 35] </ref>, which allows unit time communication between any pairs of processors. In this network all processors are connected via optical fibers to a passive optical star coupler, which broadcasts messages sent from one processor to all other processors.

Reference-contexts: The message will succeed in reaching the processor if it is the only message being sent to that processor at that step. Concurrent transmissions to the same processor will be handled according to one of the following standard collision resolution protocols: Priority, Arbitrary, Common, Collision, Tolerant and Robust <ref> [38] </ref>. (Note that the standard OCPC model uses the Tolerant protocol.) The OCPC (ack) is an OCPC with the added feature that a processor which successfully transmits a message to another processor receives an acknowledgement as in the ERCW (ack) PRAM (see Section 2).
