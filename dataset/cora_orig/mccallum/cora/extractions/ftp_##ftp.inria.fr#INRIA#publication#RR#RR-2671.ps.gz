Once the metric is given, the mesh generation procedure is applied. This algorithm uses five different local tools for this task: edge suppression, vertex suppression, vertex addition, edge swapping and vertex reallocation (barycentering step).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Three major advantages of unstructured grids over structured ones are the ease for complex geometries to be considered and grid adaptation and general mesh anisotropy concept to be incorporated (see <ref> [6] </ref>, [7], [12]). Of course, the introduction of mesh adaptivity and anisotropy reduces the number of grid elements if the simulated physical phenomena are strongly directional (see [10] and [12]) as in the case of shocks and limit layers for fluid flows. However, two major difficulties remain.

Reference-contexts: This strategy allows us to remesh surfaces with only a local parametrization. 5 Numerical examples In this section we describe three configurations of compressible inviscid and viscous flows. For all these cases, the initial meshes have been generated using EMC2 <ref> [8] </ref>. 5.1 Supersonic scramjet inlet The first case consists of an internal supersonic flow at Mach 3 in a scramjet inlet. Despite the configuration being symmetric, the whole domain has been computed to see if the solution remains symmetric or not.
