Reference-contexts: Instead, a postage meter prints a special mark (called a postal indicia) on the mail. Fraud is a serious problem for the US Postal Service: * The US Postal Service recently calculated that meter fraud cheats the agency out of substantially more than $100 million each year <ref> [4] </ref>. * There are over 82,000 postage meters in the US that are currently reported as lost or stolen [14]. * The US Postal Service is prosecuting two cases in New York and Boston; each involves more than $4 million dollars in postage meter fraud [11].

Reference-contexts: A slightly less secure design also allows postal meters to print out cryptographic indicia. Central to our design is the use of tamper-proof computing devices, such as those in the specified in the US FIPS 140-1 standard <ref> [6] </ref>. Using this technology, we can produce secure, unforgeable postal indicia. 3 Traditional Indicia Here we review the structure of traditional indicia and define necessary properties for cryptographic indicia. Today's postage meters are portable devices containing a print mechanism and a postage accounting mechanism, enclosed in a sealed case. <p> Several appropriate tamper-proof platforms exist, and more are forthcoming. Some of these are very secure, satisfying the highest security level specified by US Federal Information Processing Standard 140-1 <ref> [6] </ref>. (This publication gives four security levels for cryptographic modules. The highest levels of security are considered nearly unbreakable systems.

Reference-contexts: This argues that we should use a signature mechanism with fast verification time. The two most widely used signature mechanisms are RSA [12] and DSA <ref> [7] </ref>; of these RSA is best suited for our purposes because it gives the fastest signature verification times. RSA is a block cipher; it signs plaintext in fixed length blocks. Given the state of cryptography today, we recommend that use of RSA with 128 byte blocks.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, we can include cryptographically signed information in the indicia to prove the authenticity of the indicia. By including information such as the mailing date and the zip code of the sender and receiver, we can also guard against forged or copied indicia. Pastor <ref> [8] </ref> gave a rough outline of how such a system could work.

Reference-contexts: than $100 million each year [4]. * There are over 82,000 postage meters in the US that are currently reported as lost or stolen [14]. * The US Postal Service is prosecuting two cases in New York and Boston; each involves more than $4 million dollars in postage meter fraud <ref> [11] </ref>. To address these problems, we propose a new system for printing postage indicia with cryptographic information. This system allows a PC or workstation with a laser printer and a tamper-proof device to produce unforgeable postage indicia. This paper describes that design.

Reference-contexts: The inclusion of time stamps allows us to set a maximum "lifetime" for an indicia. Serial numbers trace the source of the attack to a unique postage meter licensee. The second property is achieved using cryptography. Indicia information is digitally represented, cryptographically signed <ref> [12] </ref>, and printed on an envelope as a 2-D barcode 3 . <p> For a cryptographic postal indicia system, the bottleneck is signature verification: a typical postoffice will verify many more mail items than a typical mailer will generate. This argues that we should use a signature mechanism with fast verification time. The two most widely used signature mechanisms are RSA <ref> [12] </ref> and DSA [7]; of these RSA is best suited for our purposes because it gives the fastest signature verification times. RSA is a block cipher; it signs plaintext in fixed length blocks. Given the state of cryptography today, we recommend that use of RSA with 128 byte blocks.

Reference-contexts: This system allows a PC or workstation with a laser printer and a tamper-proof device to produce unforgeable postage indicia. This paper describes that design. The design of cryptographic postage indicia is an interesting exercise in security engineering. The US Postal Service's recent Information Based Indicia Program (IBIP) <ref> [13] </ref> adopts the principal design features of our model. 2 Postal Fraud Today's postage meters and indicia are not very secure. <p> This list can periodically be downloaded to scanning devices (along with a list of license numbers of stolen or lost equipment.) 8 Conclusion In the coming months, the US Postal Service plans to begin to experiment with cryptographic indicia through its IBIP program <ref> [13] </ref>. This will provide an exciting opportunity to see public key cryptography techniques deployed on a wide scale (if successful, most people in the US will be receiving mail with cryptographic indicia in the near future).
