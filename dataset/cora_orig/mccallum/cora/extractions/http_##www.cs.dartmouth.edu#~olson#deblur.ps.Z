Abstract: A class of signal recovery problems can be formulated as finding missing data at the finest scale of a discrete wavelet transform. A unique and stable recovery can be obtained by solving the regularized wavelet reproducing equation. We show that this approach has close relations to unconstrained and constrained least-squares techniques and derive a family of regularizing operators adapted to the degrading operator. Experimental results present restored images using regularizing operators of this type.

Reference-contexts: The extensions of 1-D results will be straightforward when the 2-D degrading operator is considered separable in two dimensions. Detailed derivations may be found in [7]. 5) Recently, Bruneau et al <ref> [2] </ref> took a synthetic approach to regularized image restoration with biorthogonal wavelets. In a discrete biorthogonal wavelet transform, two pairs of discrete filters, fH 1 ; G 1 g and fH 2 ; G 2 g; are used for decomposition and reconstruction. <p> These correspond to dual wavelet bases and satisfy H 1 (!)H 2 (!) + G 1 (!)G 2 (!) = 1: (24) In <ref> [2] </ref>, H 1 is taken as the discretized degrading operator, next, G 1 , H 2 and G 2 are constructed by (24) and biorthog-onal relations between these filters. G 1 is used as a regularizing operator for the CLS minimization in (3).

Reference-contexts: Then the first term in (18) is a "mid-band" consistency measure of solution x to the observation y; while the first term in (3) represents a "low-band" consistency measure. Nevertheless, given (20), the "low-band" consistency of wavelet regularized solution can be easily computed <ref> [7] </ref>. 2) The role of in (18) is similar to that in (3). When ! 0, both (18) and (3) reduce to unconstrained least-squares minimization problems. When ! 1, the smoothing and deblurring terms are balanced in both (18) and (3). <p> The extensions of 1-D results will be straightforward when the 2-D degrading operator is considered separable in two dimensions. Detailed derivations may be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. 5) Recently, Bruneau et al [2] took a synthetic approach to regularized image restoration with biorthogonal wavelets. In a discrete biorthogonal wavelet transform, two pairs of discrete filters, fH 1 ; G 1 g and fH 2 ; G 2 g; are used for decomposition and reconstruction. <p> IV. Wavelet-Regularized Image Restoration: Examples We now present experimental results of the wavelet regularized image restoration with two examples. We synthetically blurred two MR images, Figures 1 (a) and 2 (a) with two often encountered degrading kernels: Fejer and Gaussian <ref> [7] </ref>. Noise was added to the blurred images and the blurred signal-to-noise ratio (BSNR) was controlled at 25 dB. The blurred and noisy images were then restored by using the 2-D version of (21) and the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion.
