Title: The Handbook of Probability in Computing: Interactive Media for Research  
Author: Wray L. Buntine, Scientist 
Keyword: world-wide web, research, uncertainty community, encyclopaedia, annotated bibliography.

Abstract: The paper outlines a Handbook being developed for distribution on the World-Wide Web. The Handbook combines an ency-clopaedia with an annotated bibliography, tutorials, and links to community events and software. The Encyclopaedia and Annotated Bibliography form the center piece of the Handbook. Their development will be distributed amongst the community, driven by community reviewing and authorship. This is an experiment in network-based research cooperation that we hope will be a model for future publication and education media. This paper outlines the proposed Handbook, discusses the benefits to the uncertainty community, and discusses some of the development issues involved. Finally, this paper calls for community feedback and involvement.

Reference-contexts: We hope that authors will submit their own papers (and so include the text for their abstract plus cross reference key publications they cite), and that important background material from other fields, for instance, important graduate texts such as <ref> [GMW81] </ref>, will be entered due to their frequent citation. Journals and conferences can be entered via a standard list of abbreviations using the crossref facility of BibT E X.

Reference-contexts: Connections between communities (such as the observation that Pearl's stochastic simulation is a special case of Gibbs sampling <ref> [Hry90] </ref>) often go unreported in the formal research journals, but in the Handbook they could get recorded in some cases merely by the addition of a single sentence and a hyper-text link.

Reference-contexts: For instance, an introduction to importance sampling may allow the user to select a one dimensional distribution and importance sampler and subsequently graph the quantities concerned such as convergence and variance. Standard systems such as Mathematica and versions of Bayesian network software such as IDEAL <ref> [SB90] </ref> could be necessary to implement these interactive sections. Another useful integration in the Encyclopaedia would be a C++ library making simple versions of algorithms and methods accessible to those wishing to experiment. These would be linked in to the relevant sections describing the methods.
