Abstract: An essential goal of epidemiologic research is the elicitation of cause and effect relationships, or causation. Traditionally, epidemiologists (Rothman 1986) and classical philosophers (Hume 1739) have avoided the notion of absolute causation, that an event or other factor can be shown to cause another, because of the possibility of coincidence (Humes problem), incorrect sampling, or some other flaw inherent in observation. Sample-based statistical methods of inference allow the epidemiologist to avoid gracefully the problem of defending causation. Rather than assert that a factor X (such as a toxin exposure) will cause disease Y, epidemiologists are more comfortable in saying that individuals with exposure to factor X are at increased risk of developing disease Y. Risk is the probability of occurrence of some event; thus, risk is often expressed in terms of chance: Individual A has a 30% higher chance of contracting a pneumococcal infection than Individual B. A risk factor is some condition, event, disease, or other characteristic which is statistically associated with an increase in risk for a given disease. Frequently, the outcome of interest in an epidemiologic investigation is binary in value, such as diseased/non-diseased, or dead/alive. In addition, it is important to adjust for a number of factors that may affect the risk associated with a given factor; this adjustment is performed by multivariate modeling.

Reference-contexts: match set (the set of classifiers in a population matching the taxon of an input case). 2.0 METHODS 2.1 TESTBED DATA Sham datasets consisting of 15 demographic, medical history, and exposure variables, one outcome variable, and 500 observations were created using the random data generator routines supplied with the EpiInfo <ref> (Dean et al 1990) </ref> epidemiologic analysis software package. The datasets represented epidemiologic surveillance for hepatocellular (liver) carcinoma in a group of individuals living in within the same neighborhood who may have been exposed to one or more suspected hepatocarcinogens.

Reference-contexts: It is generally accepted that longer strings will require larger populations to prevent population overcrowding with overly specific strings and to improve system performance. Although a method has been proposed for calculating the optimal population size for genetic algorithms <ref> (Goldberg 1989) </ref>, the best heuristic for determining population size for classifier systems is that more is better (Robertson and Riolo 1988).

Reference-contexts: A nonparametric method based on the Wilcoxson statistic (W) and its standard error (SE W ) is regularly used in approximating the area under the ROC curve, q, and its standard error, SE q <ref> (Hanley and McNeil 1982) </ref>. The ROC curves of several tests can be compared and their areas evaluated for statistically significant differences to determine which test is best in overall discrimination ability.

Reference-contexts: Although a method has been proposed for calculating the optimal population size for genetic algorithms (Goldberg 1989), the best heuristic for determining population size for classifier systems is that more is better <ref> (Robertson and Riolo 1988) </ref>. Given this heuristic, and given that NEWBOOLE was parameterized at a population size of 1,000 for the 11-multiplexer problem, the performance of EpiCS using several population sizes between 400 and 2,000 was investigated.

Reference-contexts: EpiCS departed from NEWBOOLE and its predecessor, BOOLE <ref> (Wilson 1987) </ref> on several features: population size, algorithms for controlling under and overgeneralization, and a methodology for determining risk as a measure of classification. Population size The testbed data required 15 positions on a taxon (rather than the six needed for the 6-multiplexer).
