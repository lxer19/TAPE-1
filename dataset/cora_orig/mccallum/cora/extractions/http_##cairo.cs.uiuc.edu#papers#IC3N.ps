Abstract: The goal of Quality-of-Service (QoS) routing is to find a network path which has sufficient resources to satisfy certain constraints on metrics such as delay and bandwidth. The state information maintained at every node is often imprecise in a dynamic network because of non-negligible propagation delay of state messages, periodic updates due to overhead concern, and hierarchical state aggregation. The information imprecision makes QoS routing difficult. The traditional shortest-path routing algorithm does not provide satisfactory performance when the state information is imprecise, and the flooding algorithm has an excessively high overhead. We propose a distributed routing scheme, called ticket-based probing, which searches multiple paths in parallel for a qualified one. The scheme is based on a realistic imprecision state model. The number of paths searched is determined in a flexible way, which allows the dynamic tradeoff between the overhead and the routing performance. The proposed routing algorithms collectively utilize the state information of the intermediate nodes to guide the routing messages along the most appropriate paths, so that the success probability is maximized with limited overhead. The algorithms consider not only the QoS requirement but also the optimality of the routing path. Low-cost paths are given preference in order to improve the overall network performance.

Reference-contexts: Hence, for a probe having traversed a path of l hops, l messages are counted. The network topology used in our simulation is shown in Figure 5, which expends the major circuits in ANSNET <ref> [4] </ref> by inserting additional links to increase the connectivity. The source node, the destination node and the delay requirement (D) of each connection request are randomly generated. D is uniformly distributed in the range of [30; 160ms]. The cost of each link is uniformly distributed in [0; 200].

Reference-contexts: However, the state aggregation in hierarchical routing increases the level of imprecision [7]. In this paper, we propose a distributed QoS routing scheme that works with imprecise state information. Two routing problems are studied. They are delay-constrained least-cost routing and bandwidth-constrained least-cost routing. The first one is NP-complete <ref> [6] </ref>. A path which satisfies a given delay constraint (or bandwidth constraint) is called a feasible path. The design goal of our heuristic algorithms is to find a low-cost feasible path by only using imprecise state information available. <p> When there are multiple feasible paths, we want to select the one with the least cost. Finding the delay-constrained least-cost path is NP-complete <ref> [6] </ref>. We shall propose a heuristic algorithm for this problem, which finds a delay-constrained path with low cost in a dynamic environment where only imprecise state information is available. Another problem is bandwidth-constrained routing, i.e., finding a path P satisfying bandwidth (P ) B, where B is the bandwidth requirement. <p> Wang and Crowcroft's distributed shortest-widest path algorithm [18] finds a path with the maximum bandwidth (widest path). If multiple widest paths exist, the algorithm chooses the shortest one. The delay-constrained least-cost (DCLC) routing problem, i.e., finding a delay-bounded path with the minimum cost, is NP-complete <ref> [6] </ref>. A centralized algorithm was reported by Widyono [19] which solves the DCLC problem with an exponential time complexity. Salama et al [14] proposed a distributed algorithm as a heuristic solution to the DCLC problem. Sun and Lan-gendorfer [17] improved the worst-case performance of the Salama's algorithm.

Reference-contexts: It floods routing messages from the source to the destination. Each routing message accumulates the delay of the path it has traversed, and the message proceeds only if the accumulated delay does not exceed the delay bound. As shown by Shin and Chou <ref> [15] </ref>, when certain scheduling policies are used and the routing messages are set to appropriate priority, the routing messages travel at speeds according to the link delays. Hence, the routing message travels along the minimum-delay path arrives first.
