Abstract: The Spline scalable platform for interactive environments makes it easy to build virtual worlds where multiple people interact with each other and with computer simulations in a 3D visual and audio environment. A key problem shared by Spline and many other systems is achieving accurate time synchronization of events and data streams. In Spline, synchronization is achieved through the use of timestamps. Given the nature of the audio and visual data supported by Spline, timestamps on the order of 64 bits are required to accurately specify the absolute position of individual pieces of data in time. Nevertheless, synchronization is achieved by using timestamps only 32 bits long, thereby saving bandwidth, storage and computation time. The use of 32-bit timestamps is made possible by reducing the precision and range of the timestamps required by the data. The precision is limited by grouping data that is sampled at high frequency into lower frequency chunks, and giving each chunk a low precision timestamp. The range is limited by using an efficient form of modular arithmetic for expressing timestamps. This work may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part for any commercial purpose.

Reference-contexts: The first use of Spline has been to support a multi-user virtual world called Diamond Park <ref> [1] </ref>. Diamond Park is a social virtual reality system in which multiple geographically separated users can speak to each other and participate in joint activities. The most important part of a visit to the park is meeting and talking with other visitors.

Reference-contexts: To minimize computation and communication, the Spline world model is broken up into compact regions called `locales' that are communicated using separate multicast communication channels (see <ref> [2] </ref>). To allow applications to modify and extend all aspects of a virtual world, mechanisms are provided so that all four of the types of data in the world model can be transmitted between Spline processes at run time. <p> of data in the world model can be transmitted between Spline processes at run time, (4) the ownership of objects can be transferred from one process to another, and (5) the world model is broken MERL-TR-96-09 April, 1996 6 Time Synchronization in Spline up into locales that are communicated separately <ref> [2] </ref>. There is currently a great deal of activity surrounding VRML and Java and the developers of these tools are quite interested in supporting multi-user interaction. However, these tools do not yet support interaction between users.

Reference-contexts: To achieve scalability to large numbers of users, Spline adopts the basic approach pioneered by SIMNET <ref> [3] </ref> and the distributed interactive simulation protocol (DIS) that grew out of SIMNET.
