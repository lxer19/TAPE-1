Reference-contexts: CUBoulder : HPSC Course Notes SIMD Computing: An Introduction flflyz C. J. C. Schauble September 12, 1995 According to the Flynn computer classification system <ref> [Flynn 72] </ref>, a SIMD computer is a Single-Instruction, Multiple-Data machine. In other words, all the processors of a SIMD multiprocessor execute the same instruction at the same time, but each executes that instruction with different data. The computers we discuss in this tutorial are SIMD machines with distributed memories (DM-SIMD).

Reference-contexts: Data parallel programming is the natural paradigm for this machine allowing each processor to handle one data element or set of data elements at a time. The initial concept of the machine was set forth in a Ph.D. dissertation by W. Daniel Hillis <ref> [Hillis 85] </ref>. The first commercial version of this computer was called the CM-1 and was manufactured in 1986. It contained up to 65,536 or 64K processors capable of executing the same instruction concurrently.
