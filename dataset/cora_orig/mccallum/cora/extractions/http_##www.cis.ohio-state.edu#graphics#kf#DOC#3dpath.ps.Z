Reference-contexts: Solving our problem draws on some techniques used in finding a shortest path amidst stationary polyhedral obstacles. For the case of stationary polyhedra in three dimensions, a shortest path that avoids passing through the interiors of the obstacles is known to have the following three properties <ref> [1, 17] </ref>. 1. A shortest path from X to Y is a serial chain of line segments (i.e., is a polygonal arc) that bends at internal points of edges or at nonconvex vertices of the polyhedral obstacles.

Reference-contexts: Both problems are known to be computationally hard to solve exactly. Fastest algorithms known so far solve subproblem (i) in singly-exponential time <ref> [2, 18] </ref> and subproblem (ii) is known to be NP-hard [2]. Subproblem (ii) can be solved simply by examining all possible permutations of sequences of edges and vertices, and compute the length of a shortest path constrained to pass through each of these sequences. <p> Both problems are known to be computationally hard to solve exactly.

Subproblem (ii) can be solved simply by examining all possible permutations of sequences of edges and vertices, and compute the length of a shortest path constrained to pass through each of these sequences. <p> Sharir and Schorr [17] show that it takes doubly-exponential time to solve the system by elimination in the number of edges of the input polyhedra in the environment.

When all polyhedra are convex, shortest 1 paths never bend at vertices of the obstacles.

Reference-contexts: Papadimitriou [15] shows an approximation method to compute a shortest path in three dimensions. Regarding motion planning in the presence of moving obstacles, various approaches have been taken especially for two-dimensional cases. Some approaches use space-time <ref> [7, 3, 19] </ref>, while others are based on some form of graph search [5, 9, 14]. From a theoretical viewpoint, Reif and Sharir [16] have established that the problem is PSPACE-hard in the presence of rotating obstacles in 3-space.

Reference-contexts: The properties are described by using the concept of accessibility, which has been used to solve a few path planning problems amidst time-varying obstacles in two dimensions <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. We also extend the properties so as to permit more general types of obstacle motions. For example, when the obstacles have piecewise linear motions, minimum-time paths may bend at a point internal to an obstacle face.

For example, when the obstacles have piecewise linear motions, minimum-time paths may bend at a point internal to an obstacle face. <p> The proofs for the cases of proceeding obstacles, degenerate obstacles, and multiple collision fronts are quite analogous to the proof for receding obstacles. For detailed steps, we refer the reader to the proof of Proposition 3 in <ref> [5] </ref>, where a similar proposition for 2-dimensional cases has been proved in detail. Although the proposition in the present paper addresses a more complex case due to three-dimensional collision fronts, the patterns of the proof are quite analogous. 2 Proposition 5. <p> Note that points where two curves meet (including endpoints of a collision front) may now correspond to an internal point of L. Using the collision front concept, we can revise the definition of the accessibility graph (AG) (initially proposed in <ref> [5] </ref> for path planning amidst translational obstacle motions in the plane) so as to handle piecewise linear obstacles as follows. 1. The start point O is added to the vertex set of AG. Its default accessible time is set to t 0 . 2.
