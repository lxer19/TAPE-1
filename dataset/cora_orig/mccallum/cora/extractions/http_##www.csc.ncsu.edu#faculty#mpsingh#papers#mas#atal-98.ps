Abstract: Coordination is a recurring theme in multiagent systems design. We consider the problem of achieving coordination in a system where the agents make autonomous decisions based solely on local knowledge. An open theoretical issue is what goes into achieving effective coordination? There is some folklore about the importance of the knowledge held by the different agents, but the rest of the rich agent landscape has not been explored in depth. The present paper seeks to delineate the different components of an abstract architecture for agents that influence the effectiveness of coordination. Specifically, it proposes that the extent of the choices available to the agents as well as the extent of the knowledge shared by them are both important for understanding coordination in general. These lead to a richer view of coordination that supports a more intuitive set of claims. This paper supports its conceptual conclusions with experimental results based on simulation.

Reference-contexts: This is because of two major reasons. One, the problem of learning to coordinate and its relationship to other concepts is crucial to theories and architectures of agents and multiagent systems. Two, the present kinds of studies are of the category of exploratory research, which Cohen <ref> [2] </ref> eloquently argues is key to empirical research and must occur prior to the formulation of more precise questions and experimental protocols that are ultimately the core of experimental science. 4.1 Literature In addition to the works mentioned above, some interesting relevant approaches are known in the literature.

Reference-contexts: Knowledge is a key component of several abstract agent architectures, e.g., the family of BDI architectures [5, 13]. The MAS folklore identifies the importance of the relationship of knowledge and coordination <ref> [3] </ref>. Previous studies indicate informally that knowledge helps, but the notion of knowledge is not formalized or quantified in an obvious manner. Sen et al. recently introduced a simple experimental setup in which coordination arises among agents (optimally) exploiting shared resources [10].

Reference-contexts: As in our approach, the buyer's decision-making is probabilistic. Although their model is similar to ours, they do not study the reasons for achieving effective coordination. Results by Hogg & Huberman indicate the potential benefits of introducing heterogeneity of different forms <ref> [4] </ref>. These agree with the intuition that in homogeneous settings, the sharing of knowledge may have an undesirable effect on coordination. This is especially so when the agents must make complementary decisions so as to coordinate, i.e., move to different locations.

Reference-contexts: Also, since multiagent systems are a new area of investigation, we follow Simon's advice to study carefully designed simulations to develop a clearer understanding of the theoretical concepts [11, p. 15].

Reference-contexts: It appears that the two are complementary in that the greater the agent's choice the lower its commitment to a particular decision. Previous experimental work by Kinny & Georgeff <ref> [6] </ref> and Pollack et al. [9] appears especially relevant. However, there is more structure to commitments that the present setup does not capture; some of this is discussed in [12]. We mention some high-level open issues that would extend the experiments described above.

Reference-contexts: For instance, Kuwabara et al. present a market-based approach in which agents controlling different resources set their prices based on previous usage, and buyer agents choose which resources to use <ref> [7] </ref>. The buyer agent can use more than one resource concurrently, and seeks to minimize its total price it has to pay. As in our approach, the buyer's decision-making is probabilistic. Although their model is similar to ours, they do not study the reasons for achieving effective coordination.

Reference-contexts: This is especially so when the agents must make complementary decisions so as to coordinate, i.e., move to different locations. This problem is closely related to the emergence of conventions for resource sharing <ref> [8] </ref>. 4.2 Future Work Although we introduced some interesting considerations, a lot remains to be done. 10 Choice bears an interesting relationship to the notion of commitments. It appears that the two are complementary in that the greater the agent's choice the lower its commitment to a particular decision.

Reference-contexts: Previous studies indicate informally that knowledge helps, but the notion of knowledge is not formalized or quantified in an obvious manner. Sen et al. recently introduced a simple experimental setup in which coordination arises among agents (optimally) exploiting shared resources <ref> [10] </ref>. The agents decide locally, and coordination corresponds to their achieving equilibrium. <p> Hypothesis H1 corresponds to the principal diagonals of Tables 1 and 2. This hypothesis is clearly supported by the evidence. In this respect, by restricting our system, we were able to reconstruct the numerical trends exhibited in <ref> [10] </ref>. However, because of the above case corresponds to increasing knowledge and choice simultaneously, we do not support the conclusion that increasing knowledge alone causes a loss of the effectiveness of coordination. Hypothesis H2 corresponds to rows of Tables 1 and 2.

This was a big surprise! But it was still good news, because surprises are what make empirical research, especially simulations, worthwhile <ref> [11, p. 14] </ref>! We conjectured that the inherent symmetry in our problem might be causing this. When we tried to break it by offsetting the agents' choices and knowledge, however, it had no substantial effect on the above behavior. So we discarded that conjecture. We made another interesting observation.
