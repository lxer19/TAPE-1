Abstract: This paper discusses methods for assigning codewords for the purpose of fingerprinting digital data, e.g., software, documents, music, and video. Fingerprinting consists of uniquely marking and registering each copy of the data. This marking allows a distributor to detect any unauthorized copy and trace it back to the user. This threat of detection will deter users from releasing unauthorized copies. A problem arises when users collude: for digital data, two different fingerprinted objects can be compared and the differences between them detected. Hence, a set of users can collude to detect the location of the fingerprint. They can then alter the fingerprint to mask their identities. We present a general fingerprinting solution which is secure in the context of collusion. In addition, we discuss methods for distributing fingerprinted data.

Reference-contexts: The error correcting codes we are using have large minimal distance and hence, low rate. By picking the codewords randomly it is possible to obtain a good low rate code. We state this in the following lemma, which is immediate from the Chernoff bound <ref> [2, Appendix A] </ref>. Lemma 3.3 For any positive integers p; N let L = 8p log N . Then there exists a (L; N; D) 2p -ECC where D &gt; L (1 1 p ). The main theorem of this section now follows. <p> A routine calculation shows that for any r we have that Pr [Y = r] 2 Pr [X = r]. This means that for any a &gt; 0 Pr Y 2 k &lt; a 2e 2a 2 =k where the last inequality follows from the standard Chernoff bound <ref> [2, Appendix A] </ref>. Plugging in a = k * leads to Pr Y &lt; 2 r 2 2n # * : Thus, if user s is innocent then the probability of her being pronounced guilty by Algorithm 1 is at most *=n.

Reference-contexts: In all these domains, our scheme allows these marks to be combined to form collusion resistant fingerprints. Thus our results are general, applying to a variety of digital data.

Our results are more efficient by an exponential amount both is terms of the number of users and in terms of the coalition size. The reason for this dramatic improvement is our use of randomness.

Reference-contexts: The reason for this dramatic improvement is our use of randomness. We rely on randomness in two steps: one is in the construction and proof of security of our fingerprinting codes. The other is in the compostion of our construction with earlier elegant results of Chor, Fiat and Naor <ref> [8] </ref>. We note that several recent proposals enhance the functionality of fingerprinting schemes in various ways. Assymetric fingerprinting [15, 16, 3] ensures that a corrupt distributor cannot frame an inocent user. <p> The tracing algorithm A on input x outputs a member of the coalition C that generated the word x with high probability. With this definition at hand we turn to the construction of c-secure codes. We point out that Chor, Fiat and Naor <ref> [8] </ref> considered a similar problem in an entirely different settings. In our terms their result enables one to construct c-secure codes under the assumption that marks can not become unreadable. Under this assumption one can even construct totally c-secure codes. <p> This contradiction proves the lemma. fl This completes the proof of Theorem 5.1. 5.1 Logarithmic length c-secure codes The n-secure code constructed in the previous section enables us to use the techniques of <ref> [8] </ref> to construct c-secure (n; l)-codes of length l = c O (1) log n. We thank Naor for pointing out this relation. In this section we demonstrate how to apply the simplest technique from [8] to construct a short c-secure code from the n-secure code of the previous section. <p> The n-secure code constructed in the previous section enables us to use the techniques of <ref> [8] </ref> to construct c-secure (n; l)-codes of length l = c O (1) log n.

To prove the theorem we show an algorithm that finds a member of the guilty coalition and then prove it's correctness. 3 In <ref> [8] </ref> the codewords of C are regarded as random hash functions h : f1; : : : ; Lg ! f1; : : : ; ng. 10 Algorithm 2 Given x 2 f0; 1g l , find a member of the coalition that produced x. 1.

Reference-contexts: To make the proof work it suffices to require that no set of c words of C "cover" a word of C outside the set. This property has been studied in <ref> [11] </ref>. Using this relaxed requirement does not improve the constructions. The error correcting codes we are using have large minimal distance and hence, low rate. By picking the codewords randomly it is possible to obtain a good low rate code.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 7.1 It is possible to solve the distribution problem using O (L) size public data and O (L 1=m l= log L) private data for some fixed constant m. Proof Sketch We encode each piece p (r; s) with a secure private key cryptosystem. See <ref> [13] </ref> for the precise definitions; such systems are known to exist under some standard hardness assumptions. Let f k : f0; 1g L 0 be such a system, where L 0 = L=l is the length of a single piece p (r; s).
