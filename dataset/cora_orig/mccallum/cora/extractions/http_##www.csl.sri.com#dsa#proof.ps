Title: HOW TO PROVE FAITHFULNESS OF ELEMENTARY THEORY INTERPRETATIONS when the identities of the free variables

Abstract: In an earlier paper, my colleagues and I stated that an interpretation I of elementary theory fi in elementary theory fi 0 is faithful if and only if, for every model A of fi, there is a model A 0 of fi 0 such that the image of A 0 under I can be expanded to a model of the description of A. This paper provides a justification of that statement. In an earlier paper on the foundations of correct architecture refinement [5], my colleagues and I gave a model-theoretic characterization of faithfulness. Although I cannot claim that this characterization is original, I have been unable to find it stated, much less justified, in standard references on model theory [1-4, 6]. 1 This paper will provide the justification. 2 I will assume that the reader is familiar with basic logical concepts, such as satisfaction, model, validity, and consistency. Note in particular that a sentence is a formula containing no free occurrences of variables, and that a theory is a set of sentences that is closed under consequence. The logical notation used below is generally standard or self-explanatory. For example, for short, means the formula that results when terms t 0 ; t 1 ; : : : ; t n1 are simultaneously substituted for free occurrences of the variables v 0 ; v 1 ; : : : ; v n1 in the formula ' (renaming bound variables in as necessary to avoid capture of the free

Reference-contexts: 1 One reference <ref> [6, p. 96, Problem 9c] </ref> does give a special case as an exercise. 2 We originally intended to include this argument in an appendix to the earlier paper, but decided that most readers of the journal in which the paper appeared would not find it helpful. 1 2 R. A. <p> The proof for interpretations other than the identity is much the same. If we had used the more restrictive notion of interpretation where predicate parameters are mapped to predicate parameters and individual parameters to individual parame ters <ref> [6] </ref>, essentially the same argument used above would work.
