Title: Weighted Striping in Multimedia Servers  
Author: Yuewei Wang and David H.C. Du 
Affiliation: Distributed Multimedia Research Center Department of Computer Science, University of Minnesota  
Abstract: To cope with the increasing demand of customers, more magnetic disks may need to be added to a multimedia server to support a higher number of concurrent accesses. Due to the rapid improvement in the performance of magnetic disks, the newly added disks usually have higher sustained I/O bandwidth and bigger storage capacity. The traditional uniform striping in an environment with heterogeneous disks in the same striping group cannot fully utilize the I/O bandwidth and storage capacity of the newly added, higher performance disks. In this paper, we propose weighted striping techniques to fully utilize the I/O bandwidth and storage capacity of higher performance disks in a multimedia server. Our results show that weighted striping techniques greatly improve the performance of multimedia servers.

Reference-contexts: Many of these multimedia servers use all-way striping over all the magnetic disks. The research in multimedia data layout and retrieval in multimedia servers has also been extensively conducted by both industry and academic research institutes <ref> [11, 3, 13, 1, 5] </ref>. Almost all previously proposed approaches used striping either over all the disks or partition the disks into multiple striping groups.

Reference-contexts: We refer the readers to [12] for the detailed algorithm. 5 Experimental Evaluation In this section, we demonstrate the effect of weighted striping techniques through trace-driven simulations using Ptolemy <ref> [2] </ref>. In the experiment, we use the trace data of an MPEG-II video clip "Terminator II". There is a total number of 52075 frames in this video clip. With 24 frames per second, the I/O bandwidth of this video clip is about 4:6 Mb/s.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, storage capacity and I/O bandwidth of the storage subsystem in a multimedia server play an important role in determining the capacity of the whole system, in terms of the number of concurrent streams that the system can support. Usually, multimedia systems are built using a hierarchical storage structure <ref> [3] </ref>. Random access memory is used to cache the blocks of media data to be displayed or sent out over the network interface, magnetic disks are used to store the content of the concurrent streams, and tertiary storage devices provides all the content needed. <p> Many of these multimedia servers use all-way striping over all the magnetic disks. The research in multimedia data layout and retrieval in multimedia servers has also been extensively conducted by both industry and academic research institutes <ref> [11, 3, 13, 1, 5] </ref>. Almost all previously proposed approaches used striping either over all the disks or partition the disks into multiple striping groups.

Reference-contexts: However, due to the advance of media encoding and VLSI technology, disks are getting faster and bigger in time. The newly added disks usually have a greater sustained I/O bandwidth and bigger storage space. In <ref> [4] </ref>, Ray Freeman shows that, for every two years, both the instant bandwidth and capacity of 5.25-inch magneto-optical disks have almost doubled, while the disk access time has been greatly reduced.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the high end disks can be fully utilized to serve more requests on the average in CSWS. In the past few years, we have witnessed constant efforts in building multimedia servers in industry, such as Starlight [10, 9], IBM Tiger Shark <ref> [6] </ref>, Oracle Multimedia Server and Microsoft Tiger projects. Many of these multimedia servers use all-way striping over all the magnetic disks. The research in multimedia data layout and retrieval in multimedia servers has also been extensively conducted by both industry and academic research institutes [11, 3, 13, 1, 5].

Reference-contexts: SCSI and other bus-based I/O channels cannot fulfill such need due to their inherent unfair bus arbitration based on the priority of the disks. However, fair I/O channels accesses to disks are offered by Serial Storage architecture (SSA) [8]. In <ref> [7] </ref>, Shim and et al describes how to compute the channel access time of a request size S in SSA as t channel = S fl C SAT . Here, C SAT is a constant in SSA depending on the configuration of the fairness algorithm.
