Abstract: ketchpel@cs.stanford.edu This paper appears in Proceedings of AAAI-94, Seattle, WA, July 1994. Abstract We describe a bottom-up approach to the design of software agents. We built and tested an agent system that addresses the real-world problem of handling the activities involved in scheduling a visitor to our laboratory. The system employs both task-specific and user-centered agents, and communicates with users using both email and a graphical interface. This experiment has helped us to identify crucial requirements in the successful deployment of software agents, including issues of reliability, security, and ease of use. The architecture we developed to meet these requirements is flexible and extensible, and is guiding our current research on principles of agent design.

Reference-contexts: Over the next few months we intend to establish communication with Oren Etzioni's finger agent (used to obtain information about people on the internet) [ Etzioni et al., 1992b ] , and Tom Mitchell's calendar agent (used to schedule meetings among groups of people) <ref> [ Dent et al., 1992 ] </ref> . The fingerbot and calendarbot will not themselves be ported to our laboratory's computers; instead, those programs will run at their respective homes (University of Washington and CMU), and communication with userbots at various sites will take place using ordinary internet email.

Reference-contexts: Extensions and updates to userbots to handle new message types would have to be distributed through secure channels, perhaps by using cryptographic techniques <ref> [ Rivest et al., 1978 ] </ref> . 5 Bots vs. Programs An issue that is often raised is what exactly distinguishes software agents from ordinary programs. In our view, software agents are simply a special class of programs.
