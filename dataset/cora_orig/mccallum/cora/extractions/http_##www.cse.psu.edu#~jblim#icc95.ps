Abstract: A generalization of the well-known shu*e network is proposed for multihop lightwave communication. In the classical definition of a shu*e network, i.e., N = kp k where N is the number of nodes and k is the number of stages with base p, the realizable values of N are very discrete and many of the intermediate values of N are not realizable. In this paper, we propose a new definition of a shu*e network as N = nk where n is the number of nodes per stage with base p. Based on this new definition, we divide the shu*e networks into two classes: extra-stage and reduced-stage. Study results can be used to determine an optimal network topology when given a value of N .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Multihop networks with wavelength division multiplexing have been considered as a possible way for high data-rate communication (over 100 Gbits=sec) <ref> [1] </ref>. A bunch of nodes in multihop networks are connected by optical fiber, which has a tremendous bandwidth of tens of terabits per second. <p> Regular two-connected network topologies, such as the Manhattan Street Network (MSN)[2] and the shuffle network <ref> [1] </ref>, have been considered for possible mul-tihop networks. A MSN has N = n 2 nodes, where n is even, that are arranged in n rows and n columns connected by unidirectional links in a grid with adjacent rows and columns having opposite directions.

Reference-contexts: 0 to n 1 at each stage, a node j at stage i is connected to nodes, j 0 , j 0 + 1, , j 0 + p 1 at stage i + 1, where j 0 = (j mod p k 0 1 )p, in a perfect shu*e <ref> [3] </ref>. As in the classical shu*e network, the last stage of GSN is connected to the first stage in a wrapped-around manner. 3 Performance Analysis of the GSN In this section, we analyze the performance of the GSN. <p> Number of nodes reachable at each hop for k 0 k h # of nodes 1 p . . . k 0 1 p k 0 1 = n . . . k 1 n k + 1 n p . . . which is the same result as in <ref> [3] </ref>. In Table 2, some calculations of the expected number of hops for different n's in case k 0 k (without ?) are shown for p = 2. The results in Table 2 indicate that as the number of stages increases, the expected number of hops also increases.

Reference-contexts: A MSN has N = n 2 nodes, where n is even, that are arranged in n rows and n columns connected by unidirectional links in a grid with adjacent rows and columns having opposite directions. Efficient routing algorithms for the MSN are also developed (for example, in <ref> [4] </ref>). However, the proposed routing techniques are somewhat complicated and are not suitable for optical networks, which require information to be processed as simply as possible.

Reference-contexts: Having all of the nodes arranged in a single column is known as a single-stage shu*e exchange network. However, previous research shows that the classical shu*e network outperforms the single-stage shu*e network (for example, in <ref> [5] </ref>). Both of the MSN and the shu*e network are regular networks, which means that from every node, there exists a complete spanning tree.
