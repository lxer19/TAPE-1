Abstract: Supported in part by National Science Foundation under grant no. ECS-9001371, Airforce Office of Scientific Research under contract no. AFOSR- 90-0053, and Army Research Office under grant no. DAAL03-90-G-0008. Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control. This paper considers the robust stability and performance analysis of a general linear interconnection of a continuous-time plant and a discrete-time controller via sample and hold devices. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the robust stability of the feedback system consisting of an uncertain plant represented as a known linear time invariant (nominal) model with time-varying norm bounded uncertainty and a shift invariant discrete- time controller. These results show that the condition arising from the small gain theorem is necessary and sufficient when the uncertainties belong to a class of linear systems. Also similar results are derived for the case of structured uncertainty. Both and signal norms are considered. Robust performance analysis problem is solved by converting it to a robust stability analysis problem.

Reference-contexts: In effect, we reduce a robust performance problem to a robust stability problem with an extra " block". This is the sampled-data system analog of the result in <ref> [9] </ref>. It is very easy to show that (i) implies (ii) by the application of small gain theorem as in the sufficiency part of Theorem 5.1. Now we prove that (ii) implies (i) by contradiction.

Reference-contexts: Since is isometric, it follows that there exists an input sequence to the system such that the norm of the output strictly exceeds the norm of the input. Now as is an FDLSI system of norm greater than 1, using standard techniques one can construct (see for example <ref> [27] </ref>) a FDLSI stable strictly causal discrete-time system such that 1 and it destabilizes . Consider the perturbation := Note that is a causal T-periodic linear time-varying system, and since are contractive, it follows that 1. The proof is concluded by checking that destabilizes .
