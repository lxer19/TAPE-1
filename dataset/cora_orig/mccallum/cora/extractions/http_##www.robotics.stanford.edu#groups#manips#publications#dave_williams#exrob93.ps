Title: Experiments in Multi-Grasp Manipulation  
Author: David Williams and Oussama Khatib 
Affiliation: Robotics Laboratory Computer Science Department Stanford University  
Abstract: In this paper, we present results in dextrous, multi-grasp manipulation based on the integration of two basic concepts: the virtual linkage and the augmented object. The virtual linkage provides a physical representation of internal forces and moments during multi-grasp manipulation. It does this by representing the manipulated object with an equivalent closed-chain mechanism. To control object motion, we describe the operational-space, rigid-body dynamics for the multi-manipulator/object system using the augmented object. With this concept, motion of the manipulated object and the forces it applies to the environment are controlled by operational forces at some selected point on the object. This control force is then partitioned among the arms in such a way as to minimize internal (strain-causing) forces. These forces are characterized by the virtual linkage and controlled independently. This approach enables a multi-arm robot system to manipulate objects while performing accurate control of internal forces. Simulation results are presented, as well as experimental results for a multi-arm system of three PUMA 560 manipulators.

Reference-contexts: In [13], a controller was developed for a pair of one-dimensional arms with unilateral constraints. This work was extended in [8] to provide dynamic control of contact conditions. Simulations of a planar two-arm system with rolling contacts were presented. In <ref> [1] </ref>, a multi-arm control system was proposed to close a force-control loop around a resolved-rate controller for each arm. The forces to be applied by each arm were calculated using a cost function that minimized a weighted combination of the applied forces while maintaining the desired resultant.

Reference-contexts: One of the first methods for controlling a two-arm system involved organizing the controller in a master/slave fashion, and using a motion coordination procedure to minimize errors in the relative position of the two manipulators <ref> [2] </ref>. In another study 1 [14], one manipulator was treated as a "leader" and the other as a "follower." Control of the follower was based on the constraint relationships between the two manipulators. Neither of these methods generalized easily to systems with more than two arms.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Research dealing with the characterization of internal forces and moments has focused essentially on two issues; minimizing internal forces during manipulation [10, 11], or determining a set of grasp forces that satisfy frictional and stability constraints for point contact without applying excessive force to the manipulated object <ref> [3, 4, 9] </ref>. Typically these approaches establish the relationship between the forces applied to an object and the resultant of these forces at some reference point. They then proceed to solve this relationship using a generalized inverse.

Reference-contexts: System Equations of Motion As discussed above, consider a multi-manipulator system that results from rigidly connecting the manipulated object to the effectors of N n-degree-of-freedom manipulators. In the case of non-redundant manipulators, the number of degrees of freedom, n associated with the combined system can be shown <ref> [5] </ref> to be equal to 3 in the planar case and to 6 in the spatial case. In other words, the number of operational coordinates, m, is equal to the number of degrees of freedom, n , of the mechanism formed by the combined object/manipulator system.

Reference-contexts: This was because kinematic, joint-space constraints were used to achieve coordination in these methods. A control methodology was needed that operated directly on the generalized coordinates of the manipulated object (i.e. object-level control) and accounted for the complete closed-chain dynamics of the system. The augmented object method <ref> [6] </ref> was developed to do exactly that. It controls a multi-arm system by using its closed-chain dynamics to decouple the system in operational space. Using this method, the system can be treated as a single augmented object which represents the total system dynamics as perceived at the operational point. <p> Object-Level Control To effectively control internal forces, the virtual linkage method must be integrated with a controller that accounts for the closed-chain dynamics of the multi-arm system. Such a controller was developed in <ref> [6] </ref>, and introduced the augmented object concept to characterize the system's rigid-body dynamics. Below, we review the augmented object model for a system of manipulators rigidly connected to the manipulated object. <p> We choose one point on the object to be controlled and call this point the operational point. Because we have assumed a rigid grasp, this point is fixed with respect to each of the effectors. In <ref> [6] </ref>, we showed how the dynamics of the individual manipulators and the object could be combined, resulting in a new augmented object which models the dynamics at the operational point for the multi-arm robot system. <p> If fl i (x) represents the kinetic energy matrix associated with the i th effector at this point, the operational-space inertial characteristics of the augmented object can be shown to satisfy fl (x) = fl L (x) + i=1 It was shown in <ref> [6] </ref> that the augmented object equations of motion are fl (x) x + (x; _ x) + p (x) = F ; (3) where the vector (x; _x), of centrifugal and Coriolis forces also possesses the additive property of the inertia matrices as given in equation 2: (x) = L (x)

Reference-contexts: Each arm was then controlled to produce the requested force. Experimental results were presented for two PUMA 600 robots manipulating an instrumented beam. A controller was presented in <ref> [7] </ref> which minimized internal forces by requiring each arm to apply an equal force at some reference point on the object. A model following technique was used to provide a reference trajectory for each arm based on the desired state and the actual position/forces.

Reference-contexts: Consider the quasi-static case where object velocities and accelerations do not affect the internal stress state. In this case, we can characterize object stresses by considering internal forces in an equivalent virtual linkage <ref> [12] </ref>, defined as follows: A virtual linkage associated with an n-grasp manipulation task is a 6 (n 1)- degree-of-freedom mechanism whose actuated joints characterize the object's internal forces and moments. <p> We can independently specify forces in these 3 (n 2) members, along with n internal moments at the grasp points (corresponding to 3n actuator degrees of freedom). 2.2. The Grasp Description Matrix It was shown in <ref> [12] </ref> that the relationship between the forces and moments applied by each arm at the grasp points (f i ), the resultant force and moment at the operational point (F R ), and the internal forces and moments (F I ), can be written as F I = G grasp 2 <p> The explicit formulas for G grasp and G 1 grasp are given in <ref> [12] </ref>. An equivalent matrix, G, can be defined which relates the forces applied by each arm at the operational point to the resultant and internal forces. G and G 1 are easily computed from the corresponding matrices developed in [12]. <p> formulas for G grasp and G 1 grasp are given in <ref> [12] </ref>. An equivalent matrix, G, can be defined which relates the forces applied by each arm at the operational point to the resultant and internal forces. G and G 1 are easily computed from the corresponding matrices developed in [12]. For some grasp configurations, the rank of the grasp description matrix G might be deficient. In such a situation, the virtual linkage is at a kinematic singularity; two or more adjacent members are aligned.

Reference-contexts: Each of these methods is able to control the trajectory of an object while minimizing internal forces and moments. However, none provide the ability to specify non-zero internal forces, which can be quite useful for pre-loading in assembly tasks. The importance of this feature was demonstrated in <ref> [15] </ref>, where a trajectory planner was developed to perform the specific task of pre-loading a flexible beam using two coordinating PUMA 560 manipulators. Although a great deal of progress has been made in multi-grasp manip-ulation, none of the work described above considers internal force dynamics.
