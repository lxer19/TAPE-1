Abstract: This paper investigates the behavior of three-stage Clos networks for randomized multicast communications. Even though lack of multicast capability in input switches requires a prohibitively large number of middle switches to provide compatible requests with nonblocking paths, a probabilistic model gives an observation that the blocking probability decreases drastically and approaches zero as the number of middle switches is far less than the theoretical bound. The S-shaped curves of blocking probability versus degree of fanout indicate that high fanout requests are mostly blocked at some given reference network utilization. A split routing algorithm and its blocking probability are introduced to enhance routability of the high fanout requests, which are corroborated by performing network simulations based on random request generator and random routing strategy.

The second routing strategy defers fanning out until it is required. This lazy fanout algorithm finds a single middle switch which makes connections to all destination output switches.

The first study which allowed any stage switches to fanout was carried out by Yang and Masson <ref> [7] </ref>. They proved that if the number of middle switches is O (n log r= log log r), the network is nonblocking provided that all requests use at most k middle switches, where k is a constant. <p> It allows the input switch to replicate the request to several middle switches and each middle switch to route a subset of destinations. All three stage switches in this strategy should have the multicast capabilities. Yang and Masson <ref> [7] </ref> elaborated a novel routing algorithm of this class, which requires (n 1) min (k + r 1=k ) + 1 middle switches for any constant k. <p> However, we impose the replicated requests to have the same number of desti nations possibly except the last one, unlike Yang and Masson <ref> [7] </ref> in which a middle switch can reach to any number of output switches unless the number of middle switches is not larger than some constant number.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the blocking probability for a request of fanout d in Theorem 1 is zero. 2 The result of C (n; r; m) network can be extended to an asymmetric Clos network. See <ref> [11] </ref> for the detail. 4 SPLIT ROUTING ALGORITHM One of problems in the lazy fanout algorithm is that the blocking probability for a large fanout request is almost close to 1 at the given reference network utilization if m is not large. <p> We can route a request in O (m r) time complexity on CREW with O ( p processors <ref> [11] </ref>. 5 EXPERIMENTS Our network simulator consists of a random request generator and a random router. The random request generator creates a compatible request whose fanout is governed by a given density function. However, the source and the destinations of the request are randomly determined.
