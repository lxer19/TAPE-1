Title: A new implementation of L A T E X's tabular and array environment  
Author: Frank Mittelbach David Carlisle 
Note: The major part of the code for this package dates back to 1988|so does some of its documentation.  
Date: Printed April 26, 1996  
Abstract: This article describes an extended implementation of the L A T E X array-and tabular-environments. The special merits of this implementation are further options to format columns and the fact that fragile L A T E X-commands don't have to be "protect'ed any more within those environments.
