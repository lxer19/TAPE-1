Abstract: The evolutionary history of nervous systems can provide useful insights for biologically-inspired robot design. The study of trace fossils, the fossilised remains of animal behaviour, reveals interesting parallels with recent research in behaviour-based robotics. This paper reports robot simulations of the meandering foraging trails left by early invertebrates which demonstrate that such trails can be generated by mechanisms similar to those used for robot wall-following. We conclude with the tentative suggestion that the capacity for intelligent behaviour shown by current behaviour-based robots is similar to that of animals of the early Cambrian period approximately 530-544 million years ago.

Reference-contexts: The principle of a complex behaviour pattern emerging from the competitive interaction of a number of simple reactions is a characteristic that Raup and Seilacher's work clearly shares with the behaviour-based robotics approach of Brooks and others <ref> (e.g. Brooks, 1986, Maes, 1992) </ref>. Indeed, the meandering behaviour generator is not unlike a robot wall-following mechanism in which the object being followed, rather than being a fixed contour, is the trail of disturbed sediment generated by the animals own movements.

Reference-contexts: For instance, Brooks Brooks, 1986 has proposed building complex robot control systems by progressively incrementing an initially simple system with extensive testing and debugging of each intermediate architecture. This layering process has been offered as roughly analogous to the processes of natural evolution <ref> (Brooks, 1991) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This relatively inefficient foraging behaviour, a characteristic of early fossils, is taken by Raup and Seilacher as evidence that thigmotaxis and phobotaxis are "genetically distinct behavioural reactions". Like wall-following in Prescott & Ibbotson The early evolution of spatial behaviour behaviour-based robots <ref> (see, e.g. Maes, 1992) </ref> the foraging meander is seen as an emergent pattern arising from the environment-mediated interaction of two distinct behavioural competences.

Such creatures left no actual fossils as they had virtually no hard body-parts. Fortunately, however, they did leave a fossil record of sortssome of the tracks, trails, and burrows that these early invertebrates left in the sediment were preserved forming what are now called trace fossils.
