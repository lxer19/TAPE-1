Title: A LAYERED DCT CODER FOR INTERNET VIDEO

Abstract: Several compressionschemesfor Internet video utilize block-based conditional replenishment (CR) where block updates are coded independently of the past. In the current Internet video tools, blocks are compressed with a single-layer representation. We propose a new approach that compresses image blocks using a layered representation. Our Layered-DCT (LDCT) compression algorithm, derived from progressive JPEG, has been combined with CR and optimized for efficient software implementation to provide an improved solution for Internet packet video. Although LDCT is constrained to a layered representation, its compression performance is as good or better than the single layer Intra-H.261 and baseline JPEG coding schemes.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Large-scale, real-time multipoint video distribution has become a commonly used communications medium in the Internet. Although the deployment of IP Multicast <ref> [3] </ref> provides a mechanism for efficiently transmitting a packetized video stream to large numbers of receivers simultaneously, the high-degree of heterogeneity prevalent in the Internet complicates the distribution problem.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we propose a third block code, namely progressive refinement of DCT coefficients. Our compression scheme, LDCT, is a layered DCT-based compression algorithm for Internet video based on the point transform technique used in progressive-mode JPEG <ref> [8, Annex G] </ref>. LDCT codes bit planes of transform coefficients in most-significant to least-significant order to realize a layered structure. LDCT is suited for Internet video because it is a block based scheme that complements the conditional replenishment model.

We and others have proposed to solve this problem through the combination of layered compression and hierarchical transmission [1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 14]. <p> Spatial redundancy is eliminated within each block through the use of transform coding. For example, nv uses a Haar transform with run-length coding while vic uses a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) in its Intra-H.261 coder <ref> [9] </ref>. If we replace these monolithic block coding algorithms with a layered block coding algorithm, we can produce a layered output that can be used with our layered transmission system. <p> In addition, the algorithm lends itself to optimizations that result both in higher compression and reduction in computational complexity. LDCT can be implemented efficiently in software and achieves compression performance comparable to or better than Intra-H.261 <ref> [9] </ref> and Motion JPEG. 2. PROGRESSIVE JPEG Before describing the LDCT algorithm, we first give a high-level description of progressive-mode JPEG (PJPEG) algorithm. PJPEG operates on units of 8x8 DCT coefficient blocks.

Reference-contexts: This both improves locality of reference and avoids the memory traffic penalty incurred by an additional pass over the output buffer. The resulting decoder performs a minimal amount of passes over the output buffer (one per received layer) and avoids unnecessary memory accesses. 5. RESULTS Said & Pearlman <ref> [12] </ref> proposed their set-partitioning compression algorithm (SPIHT) as an efficient coding scheme with a layered representation. We therefore compared the LDCT codec performance with that of SPIHT. Figure 3 shows timing results for the LDCT and SPIHT codecs in coding and decoding of a 512x512 version of the Lena image.
