Title: The Structure-Mapping Engine: Algorithm and Examples  
Author: Brian Falkenhainer Kenneth D. Forbus Dedre Gentner 
Affiliation: Qualitative Reasoning Group Department of Computer Science  Qualitative Reasoning Group Department of Computer Science  Psychology Department  
Abstract: This paper describes the Structure-Mapping Engine (SME), a program for studying analogical processing. SME has been built to explore Gentner's Structure-mapping theory of analogy, and provides a "tool kit" for constructing matching algorithms consistent with this theory. Its flexibility enhances cognitive simulation studies by simplifying experimentation. Furthermore, SME is very efficient, making it a useful component in machine learning systems as well. We review the Structure-mapping theory and describe the design of the engine. We analyze the complexity of the algorithm, and demonstrate that most of the steps are polynomial, typically bounded by O (N 2 ). Next we demonstrate some examples of its operation taken from our cognitive simulation studies and work in machine learning. Finally, we compare SME to other analogy programs and discuss several areas for future work. This paper appeared in Artificial Intelligence, 41, 1989, pp 1-63.

Reference-contexts: First we assume a software architecture that allows tasks to be spawned for parallel execution (such as <ref> [1] </ref>), and we ignore communications and setup costs. Constructing Match Hypotheses All :filter rules can be run independently, giving rise to O (N 2 ) tasks. With enough processors this could be done in constant time, assuming the Structure-Mapping match constructor rules.

Reference-contexts: Given our experience with PHINEAS, we believe SME will prove to be a useful tool for such systems. SME computes a structural match first, and then uses this structural match to derive candidate inferences. The implementations of Winston [73] and Burstein <ref> [5] </ref> are similar to SME in this respect. An alternate strategy is used by Winston [74], Kedar-Cabelli [47], Carbonell [6,7], and Greiner The Structure-Mapping Engine 36 [38].

Reference-contexts: Allowing many-to-one mappings undercuts structural consistency, which in our view is central to analogy. Many-to-one mappings appear to be permitted in artistic metaphor, but are not viewed as acceptable by subjects in explanatory, predictive analogies [28,36]. However, we agree that multiple mappings are sometimes useful <ref> [11] </ref>. We propose that many-to-one mappings should be viewed as multiple analogies between the same base and target. Since SME produces all of the interpretations of an analogy, a postprocessor could keep more than one of them to achieve the advantages of many-to-one mappings, without sacrificing consistency and structural clarity.

Reference-contexts: Since these systems were not designed for analogy, they resemble the operation of SME programmed as a literal graph matcher (e.g., they could not match Pressure to Temperature). Hayes-Roth & McDermott's SPROUTER [40] and Diettrich & Michalski's INDUCE 1.2 <ref> [14] </ref> possess our restriction of one-to-one consistency in matching. Vere's THOTH system [68,69] uses less stringent match criteria. Once the initial sets of matched terms are built, previously unmatched terms may be added to the match if their constants are in related positions.

Reference-contexts: After a brief introduction to the evidence processing mechanism, we describe each phase in turn. The management of numerical evidence is performed by a Belief Maintenance System (BMS) <ref> [15] </ref>. The BMS is much like a standard TMS, using horn clauses as justifications. However, the justifications are annotated with evidential weights, so that "degrees of belief" may be propagated. A modified version of Dempster-Shafer formalism is used for expressing and combining evidence. <p> In addition to providing evidence combination, these justifications provide useful explanations about the structural evaluation (see <ref> [15] </ref>). Two caveats about the role of numerical evidence in SME: (1) While we have found Dempster-Shafer useful, our algorithms are independent of its details, and should work with any reasonable formalism for combining evidence. (2) We use numerical evidence to provide a simple way to combine local information.

Reference-contexts: We believe one solution is to invoke SME repeatedly, using knowledge of the definitions of predicates to "slide" the base or target descriptions up or down in the space of possible representations appropriately. 8 SME is publically available for interested researchers. There is a manual available <ref> [18] </ref> which provides extensive implementation-level details and interface information. The Structure-Mapping Engine 40 An orthogonal consideration is the degree of systematicity. Worst-case behavior tends to occur when representations are large and relatively flat. Changes in representation can make large differences.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, to provide maximum flexibility, evidence rules are used to compute the evidence of gmaps as well. Originally we combined evidence for gmaps according to Dempster's rule, so that the sum of beliefs for all the gmaps equaled 1 <ref> [20] </ref>. We discovered two problems with this scheme. First, Dempster's rule is susceptible to roundoff, which caused stability problems when a large number of match hypotheses supported a gmap. <p> Fortunately, it is irrelevant to our analysis since the BMS can be eliminated if detailed justifications of evidential results are not required. For example, the first version of SME <ref> [20] </ref> used specialized evidence rules which had most of the flexibility of the BMS-based rules yet ran in O (M) time. Although the flexibility of the BMS can be valuable, in fact the majority of SME's processing time takes place within it typically 70 to 80%.

Reference-contexts: So far, we have used descriptions generated by two different qualitative simulation programs with encouraging results. For example, SME actually performs better on a water-flow / heat-flow comparison using more complex descriptions generated by GIZMO <ref> [23] </ref> than on many hand-generated descriptions. We are working on other, similar systems, as described in Section 6.3.1. 4.2 Solar System - Rutherford Atom Analogy The Rutherford model of the hydrogen atom was a classic use of analogy in science.

Reference-contexts: For example, two psychological studies [33,56] have explored the variables that determine the accessibility of a similarity match and the inferential soundness of a match. Structure-mapping predicts that the degree of systematic relational overlap will determine soundness <ref> [29] </ref>. In contrast, Gentner [30,31] has suggested that the accessibility of potential matches in long-term memory is heavily influenced by surface similarity. Psychological studies have supported both hypotheses [33,56,58]. In order to verify the computational assumptions we then ran SME on the same examples.

Reference-contexts: In developmental work, it has been found that eight-year olds (but not five-year olds) are better at performing difficult mappings when the base structure is systematic <ref> [35] </ref>. Second, there is also empirical evidence that the different types of similarity comparisons defined by Structure-mapping have different psychological properties [29,30,31]. 3 The Structure-Mapping Engine A simulation of Gentner's theory has been implemented in the Structure-Mapping Engine (SME).

Reference-contexts: SME demonstrates that an independent, structural matcher can be built which is useful in several tasks and for a variety of examples (over 40 at this writing). By contrast, no clear algorithms have been presented based on the pragmatic account, and published accounts so far <ref> [43] </ref> describe only two running examples. Another issue is that of potential complexity. The "typical case" bounds we have been able to derive so far are not very precise, and a more complete complexity analysis would certainly be desirable.

Reference-contexts: This means these systems are unlikely to ever derive a surprising result from an analogy. A very different approach is taken by Holyoak <ref> [44] </ref>. In this account, there is no separate stage of structural matching. Instead, analogy is completely driven by the goals of the current problem-solving context. Retrieval of the base domain is driven by an abstract scheme of current problem-solving goals. Creating the mapping is interleaved with other problem-solving activities.

The implementations of Winston [73] and Burstein [5] are similar to SME in this respect. An alternate strategy is used by Winston [74], Kedar-Cabelli <ref> [47] </ref>, Carbonell [6,7], and Greiner The Structure-Mapping Engine 36 [38]. These programs do not perform a match per se, but instead attempt to carry over "relevant" structure first and modify it until it applies to the target domain. The match arises as an implicit result of the structure modification. <p> It appears that there is great potential for extensive search in the modification method. Furthermore, the modification method effectively requires that the access mechanism is able to provide only salient structures (e.g., purpose-directed <ref> [47] </ref>), since the focusing mechanism of a partial match is not present. This means these systems are unlikely to ever derive a surprising result from an analogy. A very different approach is taken by Holyoak [44]. In this account, there is no separate stage of structural matching.

Reference-contexts: Our analysis and empirical results indicate that this conclusion must be substantially modified. Only when structural constraints do not exist, or are ignored, does the computation become intractable. For instance, in <ref> [49] </ref> the knowledge base was uniform and had no higher-order structure. In such cases exponential explosions are unavoidable. Winston's original matcher [73] heuristically searched for a single best match. <p> It still stands today as the most complete analogical reasoning and learning system, incorporating a model of access, reasoning via precedents, and learning new rules from examples. Kline's RELAX system <ref> [49] </ref> focused on matching relations rather than entities. RELAX did not attempt to maintain structural consistency, allowing many-to-one mappings between entities or predicate instances. In conjunction with a semantic network, RELAX was able to match items having quite different syntax (e.g., (Segment A1 A2) matching (Angle A1 X A2)). <p> In the process, THOTH may allow many-to-one mappings between terms. The usefulness of many-to-one mappings in matches has been discussed in the literature [40,49]. Hayes-Roth & McDermott [40] advocate the need for many-to-one mappings among entities. Kline <ref> [49] </ref> calls for many-to-one mappings between propositions as well. For example, Kline points out that in trying to match a description of National League baseball to American The Structure-Mapping Engine 38 League baseball, the statement (male NLpitcher) should match both (male ALpitcher) and (male ALdesignatedhitter). <p> We have found that even moderately structural domain descriptions produce excellent performance. However, in practice it is not always convenient to avoid traditional, flat domain representations. For example, SME is unable to duplicate Kline's baseball analogy <ref> [49] </ref> within a reasonable amount of time (i.e., hours). This is due to his flat description of the domain (e.g., (MALE catcher), (BATS left-fielder), (BATS center-fielder), etc.). Thus for some cases, generating all possible interpretations of an analogy may be prohibitive.

Reference-contexts: Declaring n-ary predicates reduces the need for applying associativity to binary predicates <ref> [62] </ref>. Examples of commutative n-ary predicates include AND, OR, and SUM. Making these distinctions allows SME to 3.1.3 Expressions and Dgroups For simplicity, predicate instances and compound terms are called expressions. A Description Group, or dgroup, is a collection of primitive entities and expressions concerning them.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, one could map water to coffee, since they are both liquids. 2 Notice that our structural characterization of literal similarity differs from some other psychological approaches (e.g., <ref> [63] </ref>). The Structure-Mapping Engine 7 The first interpretation has a higher structural evaluation score than the second, since a larger relational structure can be mapped. Importantly, SME is not a single matcher, but a simulator for a class of matchers.

Reference-contexts: But it cannot be used to compare two completely different analogies (i.e., different bases and different targets). Janice Skorstad is building a programmable structural evaluator module that will let us experiment with these factors and different normalization schemes <ref> [64] </ref>. We suspect that being able to tune the structural evaluation criteria might allow us to model individual differences in analogical processing. For example, a conservative strategy might favor taking gmaps with some candidate inferences but not too many, in order to maximize the probability of being correct.

Reference-contexts: Psychological studies have supported both hypotheses [33,56,58]. In order to verify the computational assumptions we then ran SME on the same examples. Here we briefly summarize the simulation methodology and the results; for details see <ref> [65] </ref>. The hypotheses were tested psychologically as follows. Pairs of short stories were constructed which were similar in different ways: in particular, some pairs embodied mere appearance and some analogy. 7 Subjects first read a large set of stories.

Reference-contexts: The problem of choosing among all possible interpretations in analogy processing is very much like choosing among possible interpretations of the sentence "John shot two bucks" in natural language processing. A "no search" solution to this natural language problem was provided by the connectionist work of Waltz and Pollack <ref> [71] </ref>. Rather than explicitly constructing all possible sentence interpretations and then choosing the best one, Waltz and Pollack used their networks to implicitly represent all of the possible choices. Given a particular network, spreading activation and lateral inhibition were used to find the single best interpretation.

Reference-contexts: Given our experience with PHINEAS, we believe SME will prove to be a useful tool for such systems. SME computes a structural match first, and then uses this structural match to derive candidate inferences. The implementations of Winston <ref> [73] </ref> and Burstein [5] are similar to SME in this respect. An alternate strategy is used by Winston [74], Kedar-Cabelli [47], Carbonell [6,7], and Greiner The Structure-Mapping Engine 36 [38]. <p> Only when structural constraints do not exist, or are ignored, does the computation become intractable. For instance, in [49] the knowledge base was uniform and had no higher-order structure. In such cases exponential explosions are unavoidable. Winston's original matcher <ref> [73] </ref> heuristically searched for a single best match. It begins by enumerating all entity pairings and works upward to match relations, thus generating all N Eb !/(N Eb - N Et )! possible entity pairings.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, several of these researchers have adopted special cases of the systematicity principle. For example, Carbonell focuses on plans and goals as the high-order relations that give constraint to a system, while Winston <ref> [74] </ref> focuses on causality. Structure-mapping theory subsumes these treatments in three ways. First, it defines mapping rules which are independent of particular domains or primitives. Second, the Structure-mapping characterization applies across a range of applications of analogy, including problem solving, understanding explanations, etc. <p> SME computes a structural match first, and then uses this structural match to derive candidate inferences. The implementations of Winston [73] and Burstein [5] are similar to SME in this respect. An alternate strategy is used by Winston <ref> [74] </ref>, Kedar-Cabelli [47], Carbonell [6,7], and Greiner The Structure-Mapping Engine 36 [38]. These programs do not perform a match per se, but instead attempt to carry over "relevant" structure first and modify it until it applies to the target domain. <p> Unlike SME's analogy rules, this scheme makes no distinction between a single, systematic relational chain and a large collection of independent facts. Winston's later system <ref> [74] </ref> used importance-dominated matching, where certain relationships (such as causal or other constraining relationships) were placed in correspondence first, and helped guide the rest of the match. This is similar in spirit to SME's :intern match constructor rules, which generate hypotheses necessary for structural consistency based on a local hypothesis. <p> The other output is a set of symbolic assertions with numerical parameters, which is expanded into SME input by a simple inference engine that calculates spatial REFERENCES 43 relationships, such as INSIDE or LEFT-OF. Inspired by Winston's use of a pidgin-English parser for input <ref> [74] </ref>, we are also seeking a parser that, perhaps in conjunction with a simple inference engine, can produce useful descriptions of stories. 6.3.2 Machine Learning Studies Falkenhainer's PHINEAS program is part of the Automated Physicist Project at the University of Illinois.
