Abstract: A least-squares model-based approach to digital halftoning is proposed. It exploits both a printer model and a model of visual perception. It produces a halftoned image that minimizes the squared error between the response of the visual model to the original image and the response of the printer and visual models to the halftoned image. For one-dimensional halftoning, where each column is processed independently, it is shown that least-squares halftoning can be optimally performed with the Viterbi algorithm. Applying this approach to simple visual and printer models yields better halftones than conventional one-dimensional methods. Though one-dimensional halftoning is seldom used in practice, the results of this method are of interest because their appearance is due only to the models and the fundamental nature of halftoning. Thus they can serve as a guide to the design of two-dimensional approaches for which only approximate least-squares solutions are possible.

This can be done by adding a small amount of white (uniformly distributed) noise to each pixel in the image before halftoning <ref> [2] </ref>. In the case of ordered dither, an alternative way to eliminate false contouring is by using error diffusion between adjacent blocks of pixels [47, 48, 49]. This should not be confused with the pixel by pixel error diffusion algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, most printers produce black dots that are larger than the minimal size and introduce other distortions that further affect the gray scale. The most commonly used digital halftoning techniques for printers, such as clustered ordered dither, protect against dot overlap by clustering black dots <ref> [3] </ref>. This causes much of the dot overlap to fall on other black dots, rather than on space that should remain white, thus attaining a nearly linear gray scale. Unfortunately, such clustering constrains the gray-scale and spatial resolutions of the perceived images and increases the visibility of low frequency artifacts. <p> We now describe two other types of halftoning and compare their performance with that of the above baseline system. First we consider ordered dither. It is a special case of screening, whereby the image array is compared, pixel by pixel, to an array of image-independent thresholds <ref> [3] </ref>. A black dot is placed wherever the image gray level is greater than the corresponding threshold. In ordered dither the thresholds are periodic. More specifically, the threshold array is generated by periodically replicating a threshold matrix. Here we consider a one-dimensional clustered ordered dither scheme.

Reference-contexts: This can be done for dispersed-dot order dither techniques as well, but clustered-dot techniques produce a more uniform distribution of gray levels. In the case of error diffusion, the transformation is applied to the image <ref> [4] </ref>. However, this transformation works only when the printer introduces a monotonic nonlinearity. <p> The first to propose the use of a dot-overlap model to account for printer distortions in error diffusion was Stucki [15, 16]. In [6] it was found that Stucki's algorithm is more efficient computationally, while the MED algorithm has better performance. Recently, Rosenberg <ref> [4] </ref> used the dot-overlap printer model proposed in [5, 17] to derive a gray-scale transformation that can be applied to the image before halftoning to compensate for printer distortions. <p> The dashed line shows the ideal behavior of a halftoning technique. The solid line indicates the kind of nonlinearity caused by dot overlap, in that it lies above the ideal line. As mentioned in the introduction, such plots can be used to compensate for printer distortions <ref> [4] </ref>. Gray-scale distortions are mainly due to inadequate modeling of the characteristics of the display device and they are relatively independent of the characteristics of vision. Printer distortions, in particular, have a large effect on the appearance of a halftoned image.

Accordingly, an accurate printer model, such as the dot-overlap and window models given in <ref> [5, 6, 7, 8] </ref>, plays an important role. Several authors have previously proposed model-based halftoning approaches.

In two-dimensional LSMB halftoning the false contours disappear [18, 19], as they do in the two-dimensional version of error diffusion <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. This is partly because of the increased numbers of gray levels, but also because one-dimensional LSMB halftoning lacks the flexibility to break up false contours. A typical way to reduce false contouring, is to increase the randomness of the patterns, i.e. to add texture.

Accordingly, we deduce from [6] that ffi = :33 is a good value for the HP printer. With this choice, the gray levels predicted by the model for a one-dimensional sequence are the same as those predicted by the two-dimensional dot-overlap model of [6] for each column of a two-dimensional <p> k1 ; b k ; b k+1 = 000 2ffi; if b k1 ; b k ; b k+1 = 101 (6) To identify the dot-overlap parameter ffi, one may view this model as a kind of projection of the two-dimensional dot-overlap model described in <ref> [6] </ref>.

Accordingly, we deduce from [6] that ffi = :33 is a good value for the HP printer. With this choice, the gray levels predicted by the model for a one-dimensional sequence are the same as those predicted by the two-dimensional dot-overlap model of [6] for each column of a two-dimensional image whose columns equal the one-dimensional sequence. The gray levels produced by this model for various vertically periodic patterns are shown in Table 2 along with the measured reflectance (the table shows 1 reflectance) of each printed pattern, obtained using a reflection densitometer. <p> Actually, the densitometer measures reflectance density; the reflectance values are given by reflectance = 10 density . Similar measurements were shown in <ref> [8, 6] </ref>. One can see that the dot-overlap model does much to explain how patterns with the same numbers of ones can have different gray levels. For example, it predicts the relative gray levels of patterns with 3 ones. <p> February 27, 1997 16 The initial estimate of the binary image could be provided by any halftoning algorithm, e.g. the modified error diffusion <ref> [6] </ref>, the one-dimensional version of which is briefly described in the next section, or it could be a constant or random image. In some simple iterative schemes [18, 20] the binary image is updated one pixel at a time, in a raster scan. <p> Alternatively, each image pixel is compared to a fixed threshold, after a correction factor is added to its original gray level to account for past "errors." Here we consider a one-dimensional version of the modified error diffusion algorithm (MED) <ref> [6] </ref>, whereby the past errors account for dot overlap as well as quantization effects. A block diagram is shown in Fig. 13. <p> The number six represents, approximately, the number of dots over which the eye averages when viewing 300 dpi printing from 30 inches <ref> [6] </ref>. Thus, eleven is approximately the maximum number of gray levels that are both produceable by the dot-overlap model and distinguishable by the eye. <p> However, this is because the MED algorithm produces patterns that are inherently more random, not because it produces more gray levels. In two-dimensional LSMB halftoning the false contours disappear [18, 19], as they do in the two-dimensional version of error diffusion <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. This is partly because of the increased numbers of gray levels, but also because one-dimensional LSMB halftoning lacks the flexibility to break up false contours. A typical way to reduce false contouring, is to increase the randomness of the patterns, i.e. to add texture.

Better models can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. However, the monotonicity at 100 dpi shown in Fig. 10 indicates that the LSMB method is doing its job. We now discuss the results of several modifications to the baseline model parameters. First, we experimented with nonlinearities in the visual model having the power law form given in (4). <p> Similar effects occur, but are not as easily noticeable in Fig. 16. Third, a considerable number of experiments with different printer models are described in <ref> [8] </ref>. Here, we simply mention that Fig. 18 shows the result of halftoning a 512 fi 60 grayscale ramp without a printer model; i.e. with an ideal model that predicts p k = 255b k . The figure is printed at 100 dpi without simulated dot overlap.

Recently, Rosenberg [4] used the dot-overlap printer model proposed in <ref> [5, 17] </ref> to derive a gray-scale transformation that can be applied to the image before halftoning to compensate for printer distortions.

Reference-contexts: Aside from their theoretical interest, the one-dimensional results are a valuable guide to understanding the two-dimensional problem. In addition to [10], the two-dimensional LSMB approach has been recently pursued by several authors. An iterative approach, including both visual and printer models was explored by Pappas and Neuhoff in <ref> [18, 19] </ref>. In similar efforts, Mulligan and Ahumada [20] assume perfect printing, and Analoui and Allebach [21] consider a different display model. Carrara et al. [22] consider variations of the scheme presented in [21] and also adopt our dot-overlap printer model, while Flohr et al. [23] investigate computational issues. <p> In some simple iterative schemes <ref> [18, 20] </ref> the binary image is updated one pixel at a time, in a raster scan. In a similar scheme [22], each pixel of the binary image is either toggled or swapped with one of its 8 neighbors in a given scanning order. <p> The characteristic patterns of the various halftoning methods are evident in the halftoned versions of the `ramp' image. By comparing these, we see that the one-dimensional LSMB algorithm produces periodic patterns, whereas the MED does not. This is not true in the two-dimensional case <ref> [18, 19] </ref>. The texture of these patterns is generally better for LSMB and MED than for classical screening, principally because the latter's clustering of dots (lines) introduces more low frequency energy. In addition, MED produces some undesirable artifacts that LSMB does not. <p> Observe that with MED, false contouring is even less noticeable than in the LSMB `ramp' image. However, this is because the MED algorithm produces patterns that are inherently more random, not because it produces more gray levels. In two-dimensional LSMB halftoning the false contours disappear <ref> [18, 19] </ref>, as they do in the two-dimensional version of error diffusion [5, 6]. This is partly because of the increased numbers of gray levels, but also because one-dimensional LSMB halftoning lacks the flexibility to break up false contours.

It also depends on the choice of printer and eye models. For most of the iterative schemes we tried in <ref> [46, 19] </ref>, we found that the MP-MED starting points result in the lowest error and the best visual quality. We also found that different starting points are tuned to different viewing distance ranges. <p> example, for a 300 dpi printer with ae = 1:25 dot-overlap, we found that at short viewing distances (1 to 1.5 feet), the MP-MED start with a Floyd-Steinberg filter results in the lowest error, while at medium distances (2 to 3 feet), the Jarvis-Judice-Ninke start results in the lowest error <ref> [46, 19] </ref>. Depending on the optimization scheme, other starting points, and especially random starts result in patterns that look considerably grainier. In [46, 19] we also found that we can control the amount of sharpening by changing the characteristics of the eye filter that corresponds to the continuous-tone image (the other <p> the MP-MED start with a Floyd-Steinberg filter results in the lowest error, while at medium distances (2 to 3 feet), the Jarvis-Judice-Ninke start results in the lowest error <ref> [46, 19] </ref>. Depending on the optimization scheme, other starting points, and especially random starts result in patterns that look considerably grainier. In [46, 19] we also found that we can control the amount of sharpening by changing the characteristics of the eye filter that corresponds to the continuous-tone image (the other eye filter is fixed). As expected, the narrower the impulse response of the filter the sharper the halftone image.

Reference-contexts: Halftoning works because the human visual system (HVS) acts as a spatial low-pass filter. Numerous researchers have estimated the spatial frequency sensitivity of the visual system, often called the modulation transfer function (MTF). Typical of such is the estimate that Mannos and Sakrison <ref> [27] </ref> found to be good for predicting the subjective quality of coded images H (f ) = 2:6 (0:0192 + 0:114 f ) exp (0:114 f ) 1:1 (1) where f is in cycles/degree. This MTF is plotted in Figure 1. <p> The simplest, arguably, include just a filter, for example the filter of (1). The next simplest, and perhaps most commonly cited in image processing, [31, p. 292], [28, p. 57], <ref> [32, 27] </ref>, include also a memoryless nonlinearity, as shown in Fig. 2. Such nonlinearities account for Weber's law, which says that the smallest noticeable change in intensity is proportional to intensity. Most commonly it is represented as a logarithm or power law (e.g. intensity 1=3 ). <p> We experimented with models of the form z k = n (x k ) fl h k (3) where n () is a memoryless nonlinearity, h m ; :::; h m is the impulse response of an FIR filter and fl denotes convolution. Following <ref> [27, 37, 38] </ref>, we tried n (x) = 1 (1 x) r (4) for various values of r. (In [27], r = 1=3 was found to be best.)

(In <ref> [27] </ref>, r = 1=3 was found to be best.) It is obviously advantageous to choose m as large as possible, but to limit complexity we chose m = 9 and found a 19-th order FIR filter that roughly matched (1) for samples taken at 300 dpi and viewed at 30 inches.

Reference-contexts: This MTF is plotted in Figure 1. As indicated by (1), the visual system is most sensitive to frequencies around 8 cycles/degree. (Others have variously estimated the peak sensitivity to lie between 3 and 10 cycles/degree <ref> [28, p. 55] </ref>.). The decrease in sensitivity at higher frequencies is generally ascribed to the optical characteristics of the eye (e.g. pupil size) [29]. Notice that the sensitivity has dropped 3 db at about 3 and 16 cycles/degree, 20 db at 35 cycles/degree and about 46 db at 60 cycles/degree. <p> The simplest, arguably, include just a filter, for example the filter of (1).

Reference-contexts: Our experiments, described in the next section, indicate that even larger values of t are feasible. Further reductions in the size of the state-space could be obtained using methods such as that of Duel and Heegard <ref> [44] </ref>. To emphasize the benefits of the Ungerboeck-Acampora approach, we mention that a direct implementation of the Viterbi algorithm would choose, as its state at time k, a sequence of 2m + 2n bits from which w k in (8) could be computed.

Reference-contexts: In a similar scheme [22], each pixel of the binary image is either toggled or swapped with one of its 8 neighbors in a given scanning order. Other variations are possible, for example [21] uses swaps only. More sophisticated (and computationally intensive) schemes use simulated annealing <ref> [20, 45] </ref>. More details about the various schemes can be found in [46, 19]. 5 Experimental Results To test the one-dimensional, least-squares model-based (LSMB) halftoning method, we applied it to the five test images shown in Fig. 9.

It also depends on the choice of printer and eye models. For most of the iterative schemes we tried in <ref> [46, 19] </ref>, we found that the MP-MED starting points result in the lowest error and the best visual quality. We also found that different starting points are tuned to different viewing distance ranges. <p> example, for a 300 dpi printer with ae = 1:25 dot-overlap, we found that at short viewing distances (1 to 1.5 feet), the MP-MED start with a Floyd-Steinberg filter results in the lowest error, while at medium distances (2 to 3 feet), the Jarvis-Judice-Ninke start results in the lowest error <ref> [46, 19] </ref>. Depending on the optimization scheme, other starting points, and especially random starts result in patterns that look considerably grainier. In [46, 19] we also found that we can control the amount of sharpening by changing the characteristics of the eye filter that corresponds to the continuous-tone image (the other <p> the MP-MED start with a Floyd-Steinberg filter results in the lowest error, while at medium distances (2 to 3 feet), the Jarvis-Judice-Ninke start results in the lowest error <ref> [46, 19] </ref>.

In [46, 19] we also found that we can control the amount of sharpening by changing the characteristics of the eye filter that corresponds to the continuous-tone image (the other eye filter is fixed). As expected, the narrower the impulse response of the filter the sharper the halftone image.

Reference-contexts: This can be done by adding a small amount of white (uniformly distributed) noise to each pixel in the image before halftoning [2]. In the case of ordered dither, an alternative way to eliminate false contouring is by using error diffusion between adjacent blocks of pixels <ref> [47, 48, 49] </ref>. This should not be confused with the pixel by pixel error diffusion algorithm.
