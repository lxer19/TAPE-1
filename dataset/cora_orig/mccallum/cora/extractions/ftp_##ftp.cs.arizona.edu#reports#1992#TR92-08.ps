Abstract: XXX Moni wanted an exact statement here giving the constant in the Big Oh XXX and a proof of the statement. I have slogged on this paper too long XXX and I am out of patience to do that. Converting the paper from troff to XXX latex was a very unrewarding activity. The problem of proving an upper bound of bn=2c on the size of the minimum anchor in any n node tournament is the foremost open problem arising from this paper. Other questions include analyzing a more relaxed definition of anchors which allows vertices to be distinguished based on degree as well and using ideas such as these to come up with a tournament isomorphism algorithm with a good bound on running time.
