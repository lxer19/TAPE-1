Abstract: As intelligent systems become larger and work in increasingly more complex and knowledge intensive environments, it becomes impractical to develop knowledge bases from scratch. A practical alternative is to develop knowledge bases out of reusable components, either ontologies or domain-independent problem solving methods. This paper describes a reusable knowledge base of general principles about plan evaluation and critiquing. It includes ontologies to represent plans and critiques, an ontology of evaluation criteria, and problem-solving knowledge about how to evaluate plans with respect to those criteria. Currently, the evaluation criteria analyze various aspects of the plan structure and its use of resources. We performed a study of three evaluation and critiquing task domains, and found that our framework covers 96 percent of the critiquing criteria related to plan structure and resource use. Our framework also enables a systematic approach to the development of plan evaluation tools by following the organization of the criteria in the method.

Reference-contexts: This was described as the sum of the execution costs of individual operators, and thus could be modelled in our PSM as a linear consumable capacitated resource. There is a component for assessment and evaluation as part of the CommonKADS library <ref> (Breuker & de Velde 1994) </ref>. The assessment and evaluation strategies are not implemented, instead they are intended to provide a methodology to design systems to assess and evaluate any kind of object. Our PSM is tailored to the evaluation of plans, and it has been implemented.

Reference-contexts: The evaluation criteria range from simple structural checks (e.g., a task has no stated purpose) to complex ones that require sophisticated tactical and spatial reasoning (for example, the COA does not focus combat power at the decisive point of battle.) Our starting point was a reference document <ref> (Jones 1998) </ref> that published the results from extensive interviews with domain experts describing a total of 62 evaluation criteria. 1 In the air-campaign planning (ACP) domain, users start with high-level objectives and decompose them into subobjec-tives using an editing tool.

Reference-contexts: For reasons of space, only a subset of the classes is shown here. sub-methods exist for the other evaluation criteria in the library. The PSM is implemented in the EXPECT architecture (Swartout & Gil 1996), with the critique ontology implemented in the Loom KR language <ref> (MacGregor 1987) </ref>. Experiences with the evaluation PSM The section shows the results of various analyses that we performed on three different plan evaluation task domains. In the COA domain, the plan is an Army Course of Action at the Division level and is manually developed.

Reference-contexts: The cost of developing a large knowledge base is high, and it would be useful to transfer as much of its contents as possible when building a new system to perform a related task. Many researchers advocate the development of large, reusable knowledge components, including ontologies <ref> (Neches et al. 1991) </ref>, and Problem-Solving Methods (PSMs) for tasks such as design and diagnosis (McDermott 1988; Wielinga, Schreiber, & Breuker 1992).

Reference-contexts: Related Work There has been relatively little work on machine-aided evaluation of plans compared with the amount of work on generation. Perez and Carbonell designed a plan generation system to produce plans of high quality <ref> (Perez & Carbonell 1994) </ref>. They divided quality measures into three groups: plan execution cost, plan robustness or its ability to respond well to changing or uncertain conditions, and other factors. Of these, execution cost was modelled in the greatest detail.

Reference-contexts: When this relation is explicit we can check correctness and completeness. * Plan-level resources: checking the use of resources across the entire plan (eg the time taken to execute the whole plan). Expanding on Smith and Becker <ref> (Smith & Becker 1997) </ref> we identify several distinct patterns of resource usage that are used to build general resource checking mechanisms: A capacitated resource can exist in different quantities, and a numeric check of the amount required against the amount available is appropriate.

Reference-contexts: Theories and models of resources have been developed that characterize the nature of resources (e.g., reusable, linear, local) so they can be analyzed accordingly to evaluate their use <ref> (Smith, Lassila, & Becker 1996) </ref>. We are also drawing from past experience in building plan evaluation systems in real-world domains, notably in military domains such as logistics transportation and air campaign planning but also in manufacturing.

EXPECT's KA tools use the PSM to guide the user through the process of creating a new critique or modifying an existing one because of the explicit representation of critique classes. We would like to extend our PSM to include additional perspectives to evaluate a plan.
