Title: Solutions to Affine Generalized Equations Using Proximal Mappings  
Author: Stephen C. Billups and Michael C. Ferris 
Date: November, 1994 (Revised May, 1996)  
Abstract: The normal map has proven to be a powerful tool for solving generalized equations of the form: find z 2 C, with 0 2 F (z) + N C (z), where C is a convex set and N C (z) is the normal cone to C at z. In this paper, we use the T -map, a generalization of the normal map, to solve equations of the more general form: find z 2 dom(T ), with 0 2 F (z) + T (z), where T is a maximal monotone multifunction. We present a path-following algorithm that determines zeros of coherently oriented piecewise-affine functions, and we use this algorithm, together with the T -map, to solve the generalized equation for affine, coherently oriented functions F , and polyhedral multifunctions T .

Reference-contexts: Since the image of P T is dom (T ) (which is contained in the domain of F , ), it follows that F T is a single-valued function defined on all of IR n . By <ref> [1, Example 2.1.2] </ref>, I + T is monotone, and therefore P T is monotone. We now show that solving GE (F; T ) is equivalent to finding a zero of F T . <p> the subject of the next section. 5 Separable T A particularly important class of affine variational inequalities is that for which the set C is rectangular, i.e., C is defined by the constraints l z u where l and u are vectors in IR n , with l i 2 <ref> [1; 1) and u i 2 (1; 1] </ref> for 1 i n. This problem class has a number of features that are very attractive for pivotal algorithms similar to Algorithm AGE. <p> We first need to prove two technical lemmas. Lemma 5.2 If A and B are n fi n matrices where B is rank-1 such that det (A) &gt; 0 and det (A + B) &gt; 0, then det (A + B) &gt; 0 for all 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Proof det (A + B) = (j 1 ;:::;j n ) where the summation is taken over all possible choices of (j 1 ; : : : ; j n ) such that C j i is either A i or B i . <p> Thus, it is positive for all 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Lemma 5.3 Let A be an nfin matrix and let fB 1 ; : : : ; B k g be a collection of rank-1 nfin matrices. <p> If det (A+ 1 B 1 + + k B k ) &gt; 0 for all choices of i = 0 or 1, then det (A+ 1 B 1 + + k B k ) &gt; 0 for all choices of i 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Proof (By induction). The lemma is true for k = 1 by Lemma 5.2. <p> Let ^ A := A + B m . Then ^ A and fB 1 ; : : :; B m1 g satisfy the conditions of the lemma for k = m 1. Thus, if i 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; 8i, then det ((A + B m ) + 1 B 1 + + m1 B m1 ) &gt; 0: Similarly, with ^ A := A, we have det (A + 1 B 1 + + m1 B m1 ) &gt; 0: From these two results, we see that <p> Thus, for m 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 0 &lt; det ( ~ A + m B m ); Theorem 5.4 If A is a P -matrix, then for any separable maximal monotone polyhedral multi-function T , the T -map A T defined by (9) has the property that in any cell of linearity, the matrix representing <p> Thus, the matrix is of the form ^ A = A + 1 B 1 + + n B n ; i 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> where B i := (I i A i )I &gt; i . Observe that B i is a rank-1 matrix. Since A is a P -matrix, the matrix formed by replacing an arbitrary set of columns of A by corresponding columns of the identity matrix has positive determinant.

Reference-contexts: This idea is easily extended to more general algorithms [10, 11].

Reference-contexts: Several algorithms have been developed based on this idea. Most of these algorithms are based on the theory of piecewise linear homotopies given by Eaves <ref> [9] </ref>. The specialization of the general algorithm given in [9] determines a zero of the normal map by tracing the zero curve of a piecewise linear homotopy mapping. <p> Several algorithms have been developed based on this idea. Most of these algorithms are based on the theory of piecewise linear homotopies given by Eaves <ref> [9] </ref>. The specialization of the general algorithm given in [9] determines a zero of the normal map by tracing the zero curve of a piecewise linear homotopy mapping. It is shown in [12] that Lemke's famous method [16] for solving linear complementarity problems is conceptually equivalent to path following in a corresponding piecewise linear system. <p> We use a generalization of the normal map to reformulate (1) as a zero finding problem of a piecewise affine function; then we use the piecewise-linear homotopy framework of Eaves <ref> [9] </ref> to generate an algorithm for determining zeros of piecewise-affine functions. We describe this algorithm in detail in Section 2 and prove that under the assumption of coherent orientation, the algorithm finds a zero after a finite number of steps. <p> The theoretical basis for the algorithm is derived from the theory of piecewise-linear homotopies given in <ref> [9] </ref>. In order to describe the algorithm carefully, we need some preliminary definitions. Definition 2.1 (cell) A polyhedral convex set IR n is called a cell. If dim () = k then is called a k-cell. <p> Note that in the above definition, if M is convex, then the function F must be continuous on M , because F must be single-valued on the boundaries between cells. Furthermore, in contrast to the work of Eaves <ref> [9] </ref>, M is not required to correspond to a subdivided manifold. Definition 2.3 (function representation) Let M be a collection of n-cells in IR n , let F be a M-PA function, and let be an n-cell of M. <p> A point (x 1 ; 1 ), and a direction (d 1 ; 1) is known such that 1 0 and F (x 1 d 1 ; 1 +) = 0 for all 0. The algorithm uses a method described by Eaves <ref> [9] </ref> to trace the zero curve of F , proceeding in the direction (d 1 ; 1) from the starting point (x 1 ; 1 ). <p> At step 8 in the algorithm, there may be more than one possible choice of cells k+1 . However, a lexicographic ordering, as described by Eaves <ref> [9, Section 15] </ref>, can be used to resolve any ambiguity concerning which cell to choose. The use of such a lexicographic ordering will be assumed in the convergence proof, and will be presented in more detail in the discussion preceding Lemma 2.9. 3. <p> We now prove the three lemmas mentioned above. At this point, we recommend that the impatient reader skip ahead to Theorem 2.13. Our proof technique is based on the work of Eaves <ref> [9] </ref>. Eaves' analysis relies heavily on the notion of a subdivided manifold: Definition 2.6 (subdivided manifold) Let N be a set in some Euclidean space, and let N be a finite or countable collection of n-cells in that space such that N = S 2N . <p> Further, the ray f (x 1 ; 1 ) (d 1 ; 1)j 0g lies within 1 . Let ~ S be the collection of all faces of elements of S. Algorithm AGE is then seen to be equivalent to the algorithm described by Eaves <ref> [9, Section 10.2] </ref>, with the following relationships between the algorithms: 7 Eaves' Algorithm Algorithm AGE M ~ S x k (x k ; k ) v k (d k ; v k ) To discuss the behavior of this algorithm in more detail, we need some definitions from [9]. <p> by Eaves [9, Section 10.2], with the following relationships between the algorithms: 7 Eaves' Algorithm Algorithm AGE M ~ S x k (x k ; k ) v k (d k ; v k ) To discuss the behavior of this algorithm in more detail, we need some definitions from <ref> [9] </ref>. Definition 2.8 (regularity) Let (N; ~ N ) be a subdivided (n + 1)-manifold, let N be the collection of n-cells in ~ N , and let F : N ! IR n be a N -PA map. <p> Thus, dim (F ()) = n for all (n + 1)-cells of S. Since the starting point (x 1 ; 1 ) of the algorithm is interior to 1 , it is a regular point of F . According to <ref> [9, Theorem 15.13] </ref>, since S is finite, the algorithm generates, in finitely many steps, either a point (x fl ; fl ) in the boundary of IR n fi IR + , or a ray in F 1 (0) different from the starting ray. <p> Therefore, to guarantee that the algorithm finds a solution, we need only show that it cannot produce a ray different from the starting ray. We first consider the case when 0 is a regular value of F . In this case, by <ref> [9, Theorem 9.1] </ref>, F 1 (0) is a 1-manifold which is subdivided by sets of the form T F 1 (0). Further, since F 1 (0) cannot intersect any k-cells with k &lt; n, each point on F 1 (0) is in at most two (n + 1)-cells of S. <p> Then by <ref> [9, Lemma 12.3] </ref>, the curve index, given by (sgnv k )(sgn det B k ) is constant everywhere along the path. <p> Observe that p (*) = F (x 1 ; 1 ) + [B 1 ; B 1 d 1 ]X [*] = Y [*]; where Y := [B 1 ; B 1 d 1 ]X. Y is an invertible n fi n matrix, so that by <ref> [9, Lemma 14.2] </ref>, p (*) is a regular value for all * sufficiently small. <p> Let (x k (*); k (*)) be the sequence of points generated by the algorithm for the perturbed problem. By the discussion in <ref> [9, Section 15] </ref>, there is a sequence of matrices X k 2 IR (n+1)fin and a sequence of points (x k ; k ) such that (x k (*); k (*)) := (x k ; k ) + X k [*] for all small *.

Reference-contexts: The remainder of the paper describes how the algorithm is used to solve affine generalized equations. In Section 3 we discuss a generalization of the normal map called the T -map. This mapping, which to our knowledge was introduced by Minty <ref> [17] </ref>, provides a means of reformulating generalized equations involving operators T that do not necessarily correspond to the normal cone of any set. After describing this reformulation, we focus on the case where T is polyhedral. <p> Specifically, the T -map is given by F T (x) := F (P T (x)) + x P T (x): (7) We assume throughout that T is a maximal monotone operator. In this case, Minty <ref> [17] </ref> showed that P T is a continuous, single-valued, nonexpansive function defined on all of IR n .

Reference-contexts: A prominent tool for solving (2) is the normal map <ref> [8, 22, 26] </ref>. <p> The following lemma shows that when N = IR n , item 3 in Definition 2.6 is redundant. This result was proved by Robinson <ref> [22] </ref> in the proof of Proposition 2.4. While Robinson's proposition is stated for the normal manifold, his proof is valid for general subdivisions of IR n . <p> Thus, to complete the description of the algorithm for affine generalized equations, it remains to show how to generate the representations. The task of constructing M is dependent upon how T is described. For example, in <ref> [22] </ref>, T is taken as the normal cone N C to a polyhedral convex set C. M is then chosen to be the normal manifold, which is defined in terms of the nonempty faces F i of C. <p> Robinson <ref> [22, Proposition 2.4] </ref> proved that the normal manifold is a subdivision of IR n . However, in general, the collection of cells M generated by the above process is not a subdivision. This can be demonstrated by the following example.
