Abstract: A warehouse is a data repository containing integrated information for efficient querying and analysis. Maintaining the consistency of warehouse data is challenging, especially if the data sources are autonomous and views of the data at the warehouse span multiple sources. Transactions containing multiple updates at one or more sources, e.g., batch updates, complicate the consistency problem. In this paper we identify and discuss three fundamental transaction processing scenarios for data warehousing. We define four levels of consistency for warehouse data and present a new family of algorithms, the Strobe family, that maintain consistency as the warehouse is updated, under the various warehousing scenarios. All of the algorithms are incremental and can handle a continuous and overlapping stream of updates from the sources. Our implementation shows that the algorithms are practical and realistic choices for a wide variety of update scenarios.

Reference-contexts: Given these costs, users can now determine what is best for them, given their consistency requirements and their transactional scenario. Third, when updates arrive infrequently at the warehouse, or only in periodic batches with large gaps in between, the Strobe algorithms are as efficient as conventional algorithms such as <ref> [BLT86] </ref>. They only introduce extra complexity when updates must be processed while other updates are arriving at the warehouse, which is when conventional algorithms cannot guarantee a consistent view. Fourth, the Strobe algorithms are relatively inexpensive to implement.

Reference-contexts: However, delaying update processing means the warehouse view will not be as up to date, so there is a clear tradeoff that we would like to explore. 3. We can use key information to avoid sending some queries to sources <ref> [GW93] </ref>. For example, suppose the view definition is V = r 1 ./ r 2 , r 1 has attributes A; B, and r 2 has attributes B; C.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, although not all source states will be reflected in the view, the view always reflects a consistent set of source states. We note that the ECA-key algorithm in <ref> [ZGMHW95] </ref> does not always process deletions correctly even in a single source environment. The problem occurs when the deleted tuple is the same as an inserted tuple participating in an ongoing query. <p> Figure 7.2 summarizes the algorithms we discussed in this paper and their correctness. In the figure, "Conventional" refers to a conventional centralized view maintenance algorithm, while "ECA" and "ECA-Key" are algorithms from <ref> [ZGMHW95] </ref>. In Figure 7.2, an algorithm is shown in a particular scenario S and level of consistency L if it achieves L consistency in scenario S.

Reference-contexts: We prove the correctness of C-Strobe in <ref> [ZGMW95] </ref>. The compensating process (the loop in the algorithm) always terminates because any expression Q i;j;k hU p i always has one fewer base relation than Q i;j;k .
