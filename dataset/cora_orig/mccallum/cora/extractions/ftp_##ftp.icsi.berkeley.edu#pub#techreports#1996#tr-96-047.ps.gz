Abstract: This paper studies small space-bounded interactive proof systems (IPSs) using public coin tosses, respectively Turing machines with both nondeterministic and probabilistic states, that works with bounded number of rounds of interactions. For this model of computations new impossibility results are shown. As a consequence we prove that for sublogarithmic space bounds, IPSs working in k rounds are less powerful than systems of 2k k1 rounds of interactions. It is well known that such a property does not hold for polynomial time bounds. Babai showed that in this case any constant number of rounds can be reduced to 2 rounds.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that M A 1 Space (CON ) coincides with the class of regular languages. This result, however, does not extend to the class AM 1 Space (CON ). Freivalds has shown the surprising result <ref> [Fr81] </ref> that COUNT := f1 n 01 m : n = mg; can be accepted by a probabilistic TM in constant space with an arbitrarily small constant for the error probability.

Reference-contexts: Condon ([Co89]) proved that any language recognized by such system is in P even when the verifier works in logarithmic space. Hence the difference between the privet and the public coin tossing is significant. This property does not hold for the corresponding polynomial time classes (see <ref> [GoSi86] </ref>). In their paper [DwSt92], Dwork and Stockmeyer showed some further separating results proving a number of strong lower bounds for probabilistic finite automata and for small space-bounded IPSs tossing public coin.

Reference-contexts: But because M alternates on the i-th block with very small probability hence it can detect the difference with small probability, too. From (1) it follows that PATTERN 2 cannot be accepted by 2-round STMs. In <ref> [LiRe96] </ref> we showed a little bit more for such machines. Namely, we proved that any o (log )-space-bounded STM cannot recognize even PATTERN 1 in 2 rounds when starting in probabilistic mode. On the other hand this language is in M A 2 Space (llog ).
