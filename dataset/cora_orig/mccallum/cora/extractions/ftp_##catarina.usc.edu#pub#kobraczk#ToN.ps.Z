Abstract: This paper proposes a scalable mechanism for replicating wide-area, autonomously managed services. We target replication degrees of tens of thousands of weakly-consistent replicas. For efficiency, our mechanism probes the network and computes a good logical topology over which to send updates. For scalability, we organize replicas into hierarchical replication groups, analogous to the Internet's autonomous routing domains. We argue that efficient, massive replication does not have to rely on internet multicast.

Reference-contexts: We call the graph of these paths a logical update topology. Unlike Lampson's Global Name Service, flood-d's logical topology is not restricted to a Hamiltonian cycle. Flood-d builds k-connected topologies for resiliency. Recall that in a k-connected network <ref> [1] </ref>, that at least k 1 nodes must break before the network is partitioned. The ring topology connecting Global Name Service replicas corresponds to a 2-connected topology where all edges have equal cost. <p> They also limit network traffic associated with group membership. 3 Computing Logical Topologies Below, we state flood-d's logical topology computation as a graph theory problem, summarize solutions to similar problems, and describe our algorithm for solving it. 3.1 Definitions We provide several useful definitions <ref> [1] </ref> below: * k-Connected: A graph G is said to be k-connected if no removal of any k 1 vertices together with all their incident edges disconnects G. * k-Connected Regular Graph: A graph G is said to be a k-connected regular graph if all its vertices are k-connected. * Diameter:

Reference-contexts: It uses virtual point-to-point links, or tunnels, to transmit multicast packets between multicast routers in different routing domains. Before transmitting multicast packets through a tunnel, the source multicast router encapsulates them, so that they look like ordinary datagrams to intermediate routers and subnets. Take for example the MBONE <ref> [2] </ref>, a semi-permanent, hand-configured virtual network that was originally engineered to carry audio and video transmissions from IETF meetings to destinations around the world. The MBONE consists of islands, such as multi-cast LANs, that can directly support multicast routing linked by tunnels.

Reference-contexts: The difference between archie's and network news' performance is massive replication; there are only about 30 replicas of archie. We believe that archie and other upcoming network services <ref> [3] </ref> need support to replicate their data efficiently. To ap preciate this, we examine existing solutions to replicate data. We will see that, although they are correct and keep replicas consistent, they do not address the scale and autonomy of today's internetworks.

Reference-contexts: They try to keep up with the dynamics of the underlying physical topology, specially as the Internet's scale and complexity increase. 1.3 Internet Multicast Most people think of internet multicast and reliable mul-ticast transport protocols as good foundations on which to build a massive data replication protocol. IP multicasting <ref> [4] </ref> delivers best-effort datagrams to a group of hosts sharing a single IP multicast address. Because the network itself supports IP multicast, it has access to the network routing database. IP multicas-ting builds a minimum delay topology to transmit a datagram packet to the group of recipients.

Reference-contexts: For a current example of such a service, take Internet news. Although it manages a highly dynamic, flat, gigabyte database replicated at thousands of autonomous administrative domains, it responds to queries in seconds. In contrast, archie <ref> [5] </ref>, a directory service for Internet FTP archives, can take fifteen minutes to answer queries against a much smaller 150 megabyte database. The difference between archie's and network news' performance is massive replication; there are only about 30 replicas of archie.

Reference-contexts: Below, we examine existing replication algorithms. We start by briefly overviewing directory consistency. 1.1 Directory Consistency Group communication mechanisms for wide-area, massively replicated information services should not trade availability and response time for globally ordered delivery <ref> [6] </ref>. On one hand, these services still need to guarantee that replicas eventually converge to a consistent, updated state during both normal operation and when recovering from network partition and server or link failures. <p> He named the modified algorithm Timestamped Anti-Entropy (TSAE) Protocol and used it to build a replicated, distributed bibliographic database system <ref> [6] </ref>. Like other good replication algorithms, TSAE floods updates. Periodically, a replica starts an anti-entropy session, in which it selects a peer to exchange updates.

Reference-contexts: We compare two different partner selection policies: random, in which a replica randomly chooses another replica to exchange consistency state, and cost-based, in which the peer with the minimum cost link is selected. To assign communication costs to links, we use NTG <ref> [7] </ref>, a random topology generator, to generate logical topologies for replication groups of different sizes. We feed the topology generator with the group size, average node degree, and link bandwidths.

Reference-contexts: Plesnik [14] proves that any algorithm that generates a minimum spanning subgraph of G, say G 0 (V; E 0 ), by selecting E 0 as subset of E with a given budget constraint and minimum diameter is NP-hard. Johnson <ref> [8] </ref> states that constructing a subgraph which connects all vertices, and minimizes shortest path cost between all vertex pairs subject to a budget constraint on the sum of its edge costs is also NP-hard.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, they need not compromise their availability and response time and incur the extra overhead of strong consistency protocols.

In [15], Rose uses simulated annealing to find network topologies with small mean distances between nodes, and shows that annealing helps in equalizing the initially uneven distribution of mean distances. When applying simulated annealing to our problem, we need to specify an objective function.

Reference-contexts: For these reasons, our hierarchical replication group consistency algorithm does not rely on a reliable, multicast transport protocol, although it can exploit it where available. Recently, a new multicast transport protocol, Muse 2 <ref> [12] </ref>, has been developed to multicast news articles on the MBONE. Muse sends news articles as UDP packets to the multicast group consisting of participating news servers.

Reference-contexts: Because layered network protocols hide the network topology from application programs, replicas themselves cannot select their flooding peers to optimize use of the network. Both Grapevine and its commercial successor, the Clearinghouse <ref> [13] </ref> ignore network and update topology. The Global Name Service assumes the existence of a single administrator who hand-configures the topology over which updates travel. The Global Name Service administrator places replicas in a Hamiltonian cycle, and reconfigures the ring when replicas are added or removed.

This optimization problem is NP-complete, but the literature records approximations for similar problems.

Reference-contexts: In particular, it can not solve the consistency problem raised when replicas temporarily crash or when IP routers crash and lose state crucial to reliable, multipoint delivery. In such cases, the application itself must re-establish consistency. Recall the end-to-end argument in layered design <ref> [16] </ref>; functions that can only be completely and correctly implemented by the application should be moved into the application. In our case, since each replica must keep its database consistent, we let the replica manage reliable multipoint delivery.

Reference-contexts: For instance, real-time applications like voice and video teleconferencing, which are delay-sensitive but can live with data losses, are layered on top of UDP and Internet multicast. A new transport protocol for multipartici-pant real-time applications (RTP) <ref> [18] </ref> provides end-to-end delivery for one or more real-time data flows. It assumes an unreliable datagram service and does not provide reliable, ordered delivery. RTP can transfer data to multiple destinations if the underlying network provides a multicast service.

Reference-contexts: Johnson [8] states that constructing a subgraph which connects all vertices, and minimizes shortest path cost between all vertex pairs subject to a budget constraint on the sum of its edge costs is also NP-hard. Schumacher <ref> [19] </ref> provides an algorithm for generating topologies which have minimum number of edges, are k-connected and have minimum diameter. However, his method assumes that all the edges have equal weights. We cannot make that assumption since our problem is to build logical topologies on top of real networks.

Reference-contexts: However, his method assumes that all the edges have equal weights. We cannot make that assumption since our problem is to build logical topologies on top of real networks. Steiglitz <ref> [20] </ref> proposes a heuristic solution to a problem similar to ours. <p> When we map the above onto our problem, the redundancy matrix R i;j , the number of disjoint paths between i and j, represents our connectivity requirement. Therefore, Steiglitz's algorithm <ref> [20] </ref> not only fulfills our connectivity requirements but provides the option of having different connectivity for each pair of nodes. As stated above, trying to satisfy the redundancy and the minimum cost requirements results in NP-hard problems. We extended Steiglitz's algorithm to fulfill all our topology requirements.
