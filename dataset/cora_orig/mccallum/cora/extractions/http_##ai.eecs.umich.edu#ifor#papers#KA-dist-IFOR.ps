Abstract: A fundamental goal of the IFOR/WISSARD project is the creation of autonomous, intelligent agents that can participate in computer simulations of battle for training and gaming purposes. The creation of such an agent has many of the same requirements as constructing an expert system. In particular, the designers face the enormous task of acquiring, encoding, and refining the knowledge that defines the agent's desired behavior. The knowledge must be drawn from many sources, e.g. subject matter experts (SMEs), training manuals and other texts, observation, experimentation, etc. This is usually done by many people whose raw materials must then be represented as a coherent specification that designers can use for constructing the agent, communicating among themselves, and, ultimately, describing the causes and rationales for the agent's behavior to others. In any case, this is not a simple task, but in the case of the TacAir-Soar project, the difficulty is increased by the geographical distribution of the project's members. 1 Our solution to this problem is an electronic, multi-layer hypertext document called the TacAir-Soar Description Document (TDD) which is implemented within the National Center for Supercomputing Applications' (NCSA's) Mosaic. This document allows its viewers to obtain information about the domain in plain English, about the agent in terms of its structures and behaviors, and about the actual code that implements the agent.

Reference-contexts: Platform and Justification Mosaic is a hypermedia browser distributed by the NCSA. It allows a user to view documents that contain plain text, formatted text, PostScript, images and diagrams, audio, and digitized video. When combined with servers that use the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) <ref> [Berners-Lee92] </ref>, Mosaic can be used to view documents that are located throughout the world on machines that are connected to the Internet. These features mean that Mosaic has many advantages.

The Symbol Level There is a one-to-one mapping between the documents at the PSCM level and the Soar agent code, the lowest layer of the TDD.
