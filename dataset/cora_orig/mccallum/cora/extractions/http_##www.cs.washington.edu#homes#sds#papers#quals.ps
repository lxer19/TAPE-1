Abstract: The introduction of hierarchical tree data-structures to solve the N-body problem have led to a host of algorithms with asymptotic complexities ranging from O(n log n) to O(n). Although the asymptotic complexity of different treecodes are competitive, the constant factors between the algorithms have a significant impact on the CPU time. In this paper we examine the performance of a class of treecodes to compare the effectiveness of different tree structures for N -body simulation. We investigate the performance of these treecodes in both the serial and parallel cases.

Reference-contexts: These methods are known as particle-cluster and cluster-cluster methods respectively. 1.1 Overview We performed an experimental analysis of a class of treecodes. Driven by theoretical observations by An-derson <ref> (Anderson 1995) </ref>, we compared the performance of five particle-cluster treecodes that differ in the data-structure used in the force computation. These experiments were performed using a treecode simulator that we built. With this simulator we were able to evaluate the performance of these treecodes for a serial machine. <p> The one distribution where there performance is comparable is for random distributions where the trees are virtually identical. These results match closely with the theoretical observations about both spatial and density trees <ref> (Anderson 1995) </ref>. Some intuition for the differences in performance can be seen by examining figure 8. <p> For the mesh distribution, we notice that hybrid and spatial trees perform very well while the other treecodes perform poorly. The mesh data distribution is close to the worst case data distribution for density trees <ref> (Anderson 1995) </ref>. Because of this, all of the treecodes that are based on density trees perform poorly for this type of distribution. The hybrid tree performs well in this case because it mimics the behavior of the spatial tree.

Reference-contexts: Isaac Newton solved the N -body problem analytically in the case where n = 2. However, for n &gt; 2, an analytic solution does not exist <ref> (Appel 1985) </ref>. In this case only numerical solutions are possible. These simulations are performed by calculating, at discrete time intervals, a force vector for all particles, and 1 updating particle positions and velocities based on the force. <p> This approximation is reasonable because when two objects are well separated the error introduced into the force calculation by this approximation is small. Using this idea, Appel <ref> (Appel 1985) </ref>, Jernigan and Porter (Jernigan and Porter 1989), and Barnes and Hut (Barnes and Hut 1986), developed fast algorithms for N -body simualation based on tree data-structures.

Reference-contexts: Currently, the largest simulations involve 10 7 particles integrated over thousands of time steps. Increases in observational power indicate that that over the next 10 years, effective simulations will have to be able to model up to 10 12 particles <ref> (Lake, Katz, Quinn, and Stadel 1994) </ref>. For astronomical simulations, the N -body problem is: Given a system of particles, each with a position, mass, and velocity, calculate its motion under gravitational forces. Isaac Newton solved the N -body problem analytically in the case where n = 2.

Reference-contexts: For the type of treecodes that we are interested in, tree building accounts for under 5% of the computation in a treecode. Most of the work needed to compute the forces over all the particles is done in the force evaluation function <ref> (Singh, Holt, Hennessy, and Gupta 1993) </ref>. The amount of CPU time spent in ForceEval is almost directly proportional to the number of force evaluations necessary to evaluate the tree.
