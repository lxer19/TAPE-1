Abstract: Keeping in mind the generalization of Birkhoff's theorem on doubly stochastic matrices we define compact cellular algebras and compact permutation groups. Arising in this connection weakly compact graphs extend compact graphs introduced by G. Tinhofer. It is proved that compact algebras are exactly the centralizer algebras of compact groups. A developed technique enables to get non-trivial examples of compact algebras and groups as well as completely identify compact Frobenius groups and the adjacency algebras of Johnson's and Hamming's schemes. In particular, Petersen's graph proves to be not compact, which answers the question by C. Godsil. A simple polynomial-time isomorphism test for the class of compact cellular algebras (weakly compact graphs) is presented.

Reference-contexts: Let us denote by J (n; k), 1 k n=2, the adjacency algebra of the Johnson scheme with parameters n and k, i.e. the centralizer algebra of the action of Sym (n) on the set of all k-elements subsets of <ref> [1; n] </ref>. It is known (see [2]) that J (n; k) is a commutative homogeneous cellular algebra of dimension k + 1. The adjacency matrix of the Johnson graph J n;k belongs to the standard basis of the algebra J (n; k) and generates it as a matrix algebra. <p> By theorem 4.2 the last algebra is compact. Thus we assume in addition that n 5. Let us denote by R the adjacency relation of the Johnson graph J n;k : R = f (S; S 0 ) : S; S 0 ae <ref> [1; n] </ref>; jSj = jS 0 j = k; jS " S 0 j = k 1g: (13) and by A its adjacency matrix. Then A is a basis matrix of the algebra J (n; k) (see above). <p> <ref> [1; n] </ref>; jSj = jS 0 j = k; jS " S 0 j = k 1g: (13) and by A its adjacency matrix. Then A is a basis matrix of the algebra J (n; k) (see above). Let us prove the following statement: 8g 2 Sym (n) 9S ae [1; n] : jSj = k; (S; S g ) 62 R: (14) Let g 2 Sym (n) and F = fv 2 [1; n] : v g = vg be the set of all fixed points of g. <p> Then A is a basis matrix of the algebra J (n; k) (see above). Let us prove the following statement: 8g 2 Sym (n) 9S ae <ref> [1; n] </ref> : jSj = k; (S; S g ) 62 R: (14) Let g 2 Sym (n) and F = fv 2 [1; n] : v g = vg be the set of all fixed points of g. If jF j k, then any k-subset S of F satisfies (14). <p> If jF j k, then any k-subset S of F satisfies (14). Otherwise, since n 5, there exist two distinct points u; v such that fu g ; v g g " fu; vg = ;. Since k 2, there exists a k-subset S of <ref> [1; n] </ref> for which u; v 2 S and u g ; v g 62 S. Then jS " S g j k 2 which implies that (S; S g ) 62 R and proves (14). <p> If n 2k + 1, then G = Sym (n) (see Lemma 2.1.3 in Appendix 2 of [2]) and (15) follows from (14). If n = 2k, then G = Sym (n) fi f1; tg where t is the permutation moving a k-subset of <ref> [1; n] </ref> to its complement. For g 2 Sym (n) we reason as above. <p> Let n 5. Set W = H (n) and W 0 to be the centralizer algebra of the action of Sym (n) on the set 2 [1;n] (naturally bijective to f0; 1g n ) of all subsets of <ref> [1; n] </ref>. Below we will show that W 0 is a non-compact cellular algebra. It will imply that so is W , since otherwise by theorem 3.7 W 0 = W v , v 2 f0; 1g n , and the algebra W 0 would be compact. <p> Let us consider the algebra W 0 . Index the cells of W 0 by the numbers 0; 1; : : : ; n so that the kth cell consists of all k-subsets of <ref> [1; n] </ref>. Set A = g where g runs over all elements of Aut (W 0 ) corresponding to the transpositions of Sym (n) and = n j k 0 (n k 0 ) with k 0 = b n 2 c. <p> Since jS " S g j jSj 1 for any set S ae <ref> [1; n] </ref> and a transposition g 2 Sym (n), the restriction of A to the k 0 th cell of W 0 is a multiple of the adjacency matrix of the relation R defined in (13) (with k = k 0 ). <p> Thus W 0 is not compact. Remark 5.6 Let S be a nonempty subset of [0; n]. Denote by W 0 S the centralizer algebra of the action of Sym (n) on the subsets of <ref> [1; n] </ref> the cardinality of which belongs to S. Then W 0 S is compact iff either S ae f0; 1; n 1; ng or n = 4 and 2 2 S, 1; 3 62 S. Indeed, 14 for n 5 this was in fact proved in the theorem. <p> If n = 4, then it suffices to check that the algebra W f1;2g is not compact. This can be done for instance by Fukuda's program [4]. 5.4. Let us turn into the compactness problem of the Platonic solids graphs. It is known (see <ref> [1] </ref>) that all of them are distance-regular (even distance-transitive) graphs. So their compacntess is equivalent to that of the corresponding cellular algebras (see subsection 3.1). Theorem 5.7 The graphs of the tetrahedron, the octahedron and the cube are compact, the graphs of the dodecahedron and the icosahedron are not compact. <p> However the centralizer algebras of these groups can be constructed from simplexes, regular algebras and the algebras of undirected cycles by the compactness preserving operations described in sections 3 and 4. 6 Algorithms 6.1. Throughout the section we assume that V = <ref> [1; n] </ref> and deal with cellular algebras W on V the basis matrices of which are numbered by positive integers (colors) 1; : : : ; s where s = jR (W )j. <p> We say that (c 1 ; : : : ; c k ) is W -admissible if there exists a k-tuple (v 1 ; : : : ; v k ) 2 V k such that for each i 2 <ref> [1; k] </ref> the color of v i with respect to W v 1 ;:::;v i1 equals c i . The set of all these (v 1 ; : : : ; v k ) is denoted by S (c 1 ; : : : ; c k ). <p> Conversely, let S be a k-orbit of Aut (W ) and (v 1 ; : : : ; v k ) 2 S. For each i 2 <ref> [1; k] </ref> define c i to be the color of v i with respect to W v 1 ;:::;v i1 . <p> This can be done by the following procedure: for i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref> do c := min v2V nU c (v; W v 1 ;:::;v i1 ); := minfv 2 V : c (v; W v 1 ;:::;v i1 ) = cg; od where v j = j oe 1 and c (v; W v 1 ;:::;v i1 ) is the color

Reference-contexts: Let us denote by J (n; k), 1 k n=2, the adjacency algebra of the Johnson scheme with parameters n and k, i.e. the centralizer algebra of the action of Sym (n) on the set of all k-elements subsets of [1; n]. It is known (see <ref> [2] </ref>) that J (n; k) is a commutative homogeneous cellular algebra of dimension k + 1. The adjacency matrix of the Johnson graph J n;k belongs to the standard basis of the algebra J (n; k) and generates it as a matrix algebra. <p> If n 2k + 1, then G = Sym (n) (see Lemma 2.1.3 in Appendix 2 of <ref> [2] </ref>) and (15) follows from (14). If n = 2k, then G = Sym (n) fi f1; tg where t is the permutation moving a k-subset of [1; n] to its complement. For g 2 Sym (n) we reason as above. <p> Clearly, H (n) is a homogeneous algebra. According to [3] Aut (H (n)) = G (n) for all n. Certainly, H (n) coincides with the adjacency algebra of the Hamming scheme with parameters n; 2 (see <ref> [2] </ref>). Notice that H (n) is generated as a matrix algebra by the adjacency matrix of the n-dimensional cube. Theorem 5.5 The cellular algebra H (n) is compact iff n 3. Proof. <p> Problem 7.1 Are there any other compact primitive groups? It is a well-known fact that the structure constants of a cellular algebra do not determine it up to a cellular algebra isomorphism (see <ref> [2] </ref>). However, we have no such examples for compact algebras. Problem 7.2 Is it true that two weakly isomorphic compact cellular algebras are isomorphic? 17 Here under a weak isomorphism of cellular algebras we mean an ordinary algebra iso--morphism preserving the Hadamard multiplication and the Hermitian conjugation.

Reference-contexts: If W = Z (Aut (W )), then W is called Schurian. It follows from [16] that there exist cellular algebras which are not Schurian (see also <ref> [3] </ref>). 2.3. Let E be an equivalence on V . Set I E = P U2V=E J U =jU j. <p> For a positive integer n let us denote by H (n) the centralizer algebra of the permutation group G (n) which is the wreath product of Sym (2) and Sym (n) acting on the set f0; 1g n . Clearly, H (n) is a homogeneous algebra. According to <ref> [3] </ref> Aut (H (n)) = G (n) for all n. Certainly, H (n) coincides with the adjacency algebra of the Hamming scheme with parameters n; 2 (see [2]).

Reference-contexts: It immediately follows from the definition that W 1 o W 2 W 1 W 2 . The tensor product of compact cellular algebras is not necessarily compact. For example we by using Fukuda's program (see <ref> [4] </ref>) found 1116 extreme points of the polytope DS (S (3) S (3)) whereas j Aut (S (3) S (3))j = 36. However the following statement holds. Theorem 4.3 Let W 2 be a semiregular cellular algebra. <p> Indeed, let G be the permutation group arising from the action of Sym (4) on the right cosets of the subgroup generated by a transposition. Then G has a regular subgroup H of index 2 isomorphic to Alt (4). This permutation group is not compact: by using Fukuda's program <ref> [4] </ref> we found 162 extreme points of the corresponding polytope whereas only 24 of them are integral. 5.2. In paper [6] it was shown that the triangle graphs T n are compact for n 4 and are not compact for all n 6. <p> Indeed, 14 for n 5 this was in fact proved in the theorem. For n 3 it is trivial. If n = 4, then it suffices to check that the algebra W f1;2g is not compact. This can be done for instance by Fukuda's program <ref> [4] </ref>. 5.4. Let us turn into the compactness problem of the Platonic solids graphs. It is known (see [1]) that all of them are distance-regular (even distance-transitive) graphs. So their compacntess is equivalent to that of the corresponding cellular algebras (see subsection 3.1).

Reference-contexts: The automorphism group of semiregular algebra W is a semiregular permutation group and the corresponding permutation matrices are pairwise orthogonal with respect to the Hadamard multiplication. Since any matrix commuting with all matrices of W is a linear combination of these permutation matrices, the compactness of W follows. In <ref> [5] </ref> it was proved that a compact distance-regular graph is distance-transitive. In our terms this means that the cellular algebra of a compact distance-regular graph is Schurian. We generalize this statement as follows. Theorem 3.4 A compact cellular algebra is Schurian. Proof. <p> However, we have no such examples for compact algebras. Problem 7.2 Is it true that two weakly isomorphic compact cellular algebras are isomorphic? 17 Here under a weak isomorphism of cellular algebras we mean an ordinary algebra iso--morphism preserving the Hadamard multiplication and the Hermitian conjugation. In <ref> [5] </ref> a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing compact regular graphs with prime number of vertices was described. Certainly, it also works for homogeneous algebras of prime degree.

Reference-contexts: We completely describe compact adjacency algebras of Johnson's and Hamming's schemes (theorem 5.3 and theorem 5.5). In particular, it turns out that Petersen's graph is not compact (corollary 5.4), which answers a question from <ref> [6] </ref>. Finally we completely identify compact graphs and algebras of the Platonic solids (theorem 5.7) and characterize compact Frobenius groups (theorem 5.8). The last implies that the minimum degree of a non-compact cellular algebra equals 7. Section 6 is devoted to algorithmic aspects of compact algebras and groups. <p> Then G has a regular subgroup H of index 2 isomorphic to Alt (4). This permutation group is not compact: by using Fukuda's program [4] we found 162 extreme points of the corresponding polytope whereas only 24 of them are integral. 5.2. In paper <ref> [6] </ref> it was shown that the triangle graphs T n are compact for n 4 and are not compact for all n 6. The compactness of T 5 , the complement to Petersen's graph, was an open problem.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, there is a simple procedure discovered by B. Weisfeiler and A.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, it implies that the semidirect product of cyclic groups of order 7 and 3, acting on 7 points is not compact. Since this group is 2-closed, its centralizer algebra is also not compact. On the other hand, due to <ref> [8] </ref> 15 all cellular algebras on n points are Schurian for n 8. So it suffices to check that all 2-closed permutation groups of degree at most 6 are compact.

Reference-contexts: So the non-compactness of W also follows from theorem 3.8 after taking into account the fact that j Aut (W )j = 120 whereas j Aut (W=E)j = 720. 5.5. A transitive permutation group G Sym (V ) is called Frobenius group (see <ref> [9] </ref>) if it is not regular and G u;v = f1g for all distinct u; v 2 V .

Reference-contexts: We prove (theorem 5.1) that each permutation group having a regular Abelian subgroup of index 2 is compact. This generalizes a result from <ref> [10] </ref> which in our terms means that dihedral groups are compact. We completely describe compact adjacency algebras of Johnson's and Hamming's schemes (theorem 5.3 and theorem 5.5). In particular, it turns out that Petersen's graph is not compact (corollary 5.4), which answers a question from [6]. <p> Thus the compactness of W 1 follows from theorem 3.8 and the equality W=E = W 1 . 5 Examples 5.1. We start with describing an infinite family of compact cellular algebras and permutation groups. The following statement generalizes the result proved in <ref> [10] </ref>. Theorem 5.1 Let G be a permutation group having an Abelian regular subgroup H of index 2. Then G is compact. Proof. Let G Sym (V ) and H be the corresponding regular subgroup.

Reference-contexts: Note that a compact group is necessarily 2-closed, i.e. coincides with the maximal subgroup of the symmetric group having the same 2-orbits. Another, more combinatorial approach to generalize Birkhoff's theorem was proposed in <ref> [11] </ref>. Namely, let us associate to an undirected graph the set DS () of all doubly stochastic matrices commuting with its adjacency matrix.

Reference-contexts: Comparing the two approaches one can observe that the notion of compact graph is too restrictive. Indeed, there is a simple procedure discovered by B. Weisfeiler and A. Lehman (see <ref> [14] </ref>) which corresponds to a graph a coherent configuration C = C () such that Aut (C) = Aut () (as to coherent configurations see [7]). Moreover, DS (C) ae DS () where DS (C) is the set of all doubly stochastic matrices centralizing the adjacency algebra of C. <p> It is denoted by W U and called the homogeneous component of W corresponding to U . The basis matrices of W U are in 1-1 correspondence to the matrices of R U;U . 2.2. A large class of cellular algebras comes from permutation groups as follows (see <ref> [14] </ref>). Let G Sym (V ) be a permutation group. Then its centralizer algebra Z (G) ae Mat V is a cellular algebra on V . Its standard basis consists of the adjacency matrices of the 2-orbits of G. <p> It is easy to see that in this case each class of E is contained in a cell of W . The factoralgebras modulo equivalences satisfying the last condition were introduced and studied in <ref> [14] </ref>. 2.4. The set of all cellular algebras on V is put in order by inclusion. The algebra Mat V is obviously the greatest element of the set. <p> Since d out (R) = 1, it follows that A 0 U = 0 for all U , i.e. A 0 = 0. This proves (5). 4 Operations preserving compactness 4.1. Let W 1 Mat V 1 and W 2 Mat V 2 be cellular algebras. Following <ref> [14] </ref> let us define their direct sum being a cellular algebra on the disjoint union of V 1 and V 2 , by W 1 W 2 = [R (W 1 ) [ R (W 2 )]: It is easy to see that Aut (W 1 W 2 ) is isomorphic <p> It can be verified that Aut (W 1 oW 2 ) is isomorphic to the wreath product of Aut (W 1 ) and Aut (W 2 ). For homogeneous W 1 and W 2 our definition is compatible with that of <ref> [14] </ref>. Let us denote by E the equivalence on V 1 fi V 2 defined by the coincidence of the second coordinates. <p> Following <ref> [14] </ref> let us define the tensor product of cellular algebras W 1 Mat V 1 and W 2 Mat V 2 being a cellular algebra on V 1 fi V 2 , by W 1 W 2 = [R (W 1 ) R (W 2 )]: It can be verified that <p> Given a cellular algebra W on V and A 2 Mat V , we put in order the set of the basis matrices of the algebra W [A] according to the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm for constructing cellular closure, so that the following property holds (see <ref> [14, Ch.M] </ref>): (W-L) if g 2 Sym (V ) is an isomorphism from W to W 0 and A g = A 0 , then g is also an isomorphism from W [A] to W 0 [A 0 ].
