Reference-contexts: In the following analyses, we restrict our focus to binary images and volumes, i.e. data sets in which each pixel or voxel has one of two values (black or white, 0 or 1, etc.). Much of the previous work on properties of tessellations does the same: <ref> [2, 6, 7, 9] </ref>. Prior to tessellation we call a binary image continuous. After tessellation, it becomes a discrete binary image. The same terminology applies to volumes. 1.2 Local Counting Algorithms Much of the work in discrete binary image processing has focused on local counting algorithms [7, 11]. <p> The Euler number on a square grid can be ambiguous since it is not clear whether two pixels touching by a corner are adjacent <ref> [2, 6] </ref>. However, this does not in general mean that we can represent the true topology of a figure more efficiently on a hexagonal grid. <p> Square and rectangular pixels dominate modern image processing, but these standard pixel shapes are not necessarily optimal for all computations. In particular, hexagonal tessellations have many advantages <ref> [2] </ref> among which is a geometry which allows better perimeter estimates. The focus here shall be on comparing tessellations in their optimality for the computation of boundary size. In two dimensions, this translates to perimeter estimation.

The figure on the left is a continuous binary image. The figure on the right is a discrete binary image. <p> We start by noticing that for lines of unit length which lie at an angle 2 [0; =6], 1 This 8-way symmetry of the circle with respect to the Cartesian axes is exploited in other domains, such as in the fast Bresenham circle algorithm of computer graphics <ref> [4] </ref>. 23 the following formula for estimated length holds: L H () = 3 The somewhat surprising conclusion is that only the run, and not the rise, of such a line is relevant to the computation of its estimated length!

Reference-contexts: the literature, but Lyusternik [16, page 147] gives the definition as "a polyhedron all of whose faces are regular polygons (though all faces need not be of the same type) and all of whose polyhedral angles are equal." Properties of these solids and the regular polyhedra can be found in <ref> [5, 16, 24] </ref>. Of these, three tile space: the triangular prism, the hexagonal prism, and the truncated octahedron. We have chosen to analyze the truncated octahedron here 39 because of its symmetry properties. An analysis of the prisms seems warranted at some point, however. <p> A.1 Tilings The most familiar tilings of the plane use regular polygons. There are exactly three regular polygons which tile the plane: the equilateral triangle, square, and hexagon <ref> [5, page 225] </ref>. If we start a tiling by placing the centroid of a polygon over the origin and making one of its edges parallel to the x-axis, then there is a unique tiling for regular hexagons, i.e. they can be arranged in only one way to cover the plane. <p> give alternate tessellations, such as the "brick wall" tessellation for squares. (Figure A-1D.) A.1.1 Dirichlet Domains and Dirichlet Tessellations A Dirichlet domain or a Dirichlet cell is a set of points, each of which is closer to a given "center" point than to any other "center" point in a group <ref> [5, page 225] </ref>. (Dirichlet domains in the plane are sometimes called Voronoi cells.) An irregular Dirichlet tessellation is shown in Figure A-2.

Reference-contexts: They hope that there is some way to "recover" the lost data from this sampling process and make use of it on a hexagonal grid. However, the original data is already gone. We cannot create more data by "resampling" on a hexagonal grid. For example, Her and Yuan <ref> [8] </ref> espouse the advantages of a hexagonal grid relative to a square grid of the same resolution.

The same terminology applies to volumes. 1.2 Local Counting Algorithms Much of the work in discrete binary image processing has focused on local counting algorithms [7, 11]. <p> In two dimensions, there are three common functions which can be computed using local counting schemes: area, perimeter, and Euler number (a topological measure equal to the number of objects in an image less the number of holes). All of these functions obey the additive set property <ref> [9] </ref>, the condition which allows the individual local measures to be combined into a global measure. Local counting algorithms produce exact results for these three functions on tessellated figures. <p> B. Increasing the resolution enough will always solve the problem. C. Sometimes, but not always, the hexagonal grid provides a more efficient representation of a figure while preserving the original Euler number. 1 Horn <ref> [9] </ref> points out that Euler number on a hexagonal grid is never ambiguous since there is no ambiguity in the definition of adjacency. The Euler number on a square grid can be ambiguous since it is not clear whether two pixels touching by a corner are adjacent [2, 6]. <p> make with the x-axis, then to compute the mean value for L S over the range of all possible angles for the line, we integrate the equation for the estimated length of a unit segment (Equation 1.4) over the interval [0; =2] and divide by the interval of integration (see <ref> [9] </ref>): 0 0 = 2 R (cos + sin ) d 2 (sin cos ) j 2 = We call this value the mean length estimate (for lines) or mean perimeter estimate (for figures) on a square grid. <p> voxels? What are reasonable choices for voxel 37 shapes? What More Can We Do with Cubes? Note that even using cubes, we can achieve alternative tessellations with interesting properties by sliding planes of cubes and rows of cubes relative to other planes and rows (Again, this is suggested by Horn <ref> [9] </ref>). Using cubes we can generate grids which have neighborhood properties equivalent to the truncated octahedron tiling which we explore below. <p> Hence, one can sample space about 41% more efficiently with an RD grid. 4.3.2 Topology: Thinning Algorithms and Finite Element Methods Working with TO grids might also simplify 3-D thinning algorithms, since like hexagons in 2-D, there is no neighborhood ambiguity on a TO grid <ref> [9] </ref>. This could greatly simplify analyses such as those found in [21, 12, 17].

Reference-contexts: It is a common mistake to assume that as the grid grows finer and finer, perimeter estimates will converge to the true perimeter. For example, Koplowitz et al. <ref> [10] </ref> state: 18 If the digitization resolution is high, i.e., the pixel size is small compared to the details of objects of interest, the digitized representation of their shapes is accurate and so will be the measurements of various shape pa rameters. <p> That is, we cannot compute surface area to arbitrary accuracy by merely sampling a volume densely if we restrict ourselves to regular sampling and local counting algorithms. 2 There are many ways to estimate the boundary of a figure from its tiled counterpart. Koplowitz et al. <ref> [10] </ref> give a review of these and present their own method. Some perimeter estimators produce much smaller errors, but they require each processor to have knowledge of a neighborhood of points.

Further investigation into these is certainly warranted. Though this paper focussed on local counting algorithms, there is also potential for the aforementioned tessellations in improving non-local schemes for computing area. <p> There are those based on affine transformations of the regular polygonal tessellations (such as rectangular and parallelogram tessellations, obtained simply by shearing the regular polygons). Another interesting set of tilings are those based on stochastic processes. For example, Kulkarni et al. <ref> [11] </ref> presented some interesting properties of random line tessellations.

Reference-contexts: City Block Distance We now address the problem of estimating the length of a line segment (and hence a piecewise smooth curve) on a finite grid. Figure 1-4 shows the basic approach to estimating the length of a line segment using the so called city block distance <ref> [15] </ref>. This figure represents the worst case scenario in which we overestimate the length of the line by a factor of p 2 1:414. We again ask the question of whether increasing the resolution of the grid will improve the estimate.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, among these solids (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron), only the cube tiles space, so we have completed our analysis of tessellations for this class of polyhedra. The Semi-Regular Polyhedra Another interesting class of solids are the semi-regular polyhedra. There are various definitions in the literature, but Lyusternik <ref> [16, page 147] </ref> gives the definition as "a polyhedron all of whose faces are regular polygons (though all faces need not be of the same type) and all of whose polyhedral angles are equal."

Reference-contexts: promising potential application areas which satisfies these requirements is in medical imaging. 4.1 Medical Applications The advent of many volumetric medical imaging modalities (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), high resolution ultrasound imaging, etc.) have resulted in a large number of quantitative studies of 3D structures, for example see <ref> [18] </ref>. While many of these are based on volume measurements rather than surface area measurements, improving the accuracy of surface area estimates may make this measure more attractive.

Reference-contexts: While many of these are based on volume measurements rather than surface area measurements, improving the accuracy of surface area estimates may make this measure more attractive. Petty et al. <ref> [20] </ref> studied surface area measurements of the planum temporale (a relatively smooth part of the brain) in schizophrenic patients as a correlate of disease. Such studies could presumably benefit from better surface area measurements, especially since analytical models of the surfaces being measured are unavailable.

The Regular Polyhedra There are exactly five regular polyhedra (also called the Platonic solids); they are defined as polyhedra in which each face is the same regular polygon <ref> [24] </ref>.

An analysis of the prisms seems warranted at some point, however. <p> It is a dual of one of the semi-regular polyhedra, the cuboc-tahedron. It is also a special case of the stellated cube.
