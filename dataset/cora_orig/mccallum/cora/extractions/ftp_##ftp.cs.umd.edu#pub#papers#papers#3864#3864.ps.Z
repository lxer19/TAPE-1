Title: On the Adjoint Matrix  
Author: G. W. Stewart 
Affiliation: University of Maryland College Park Institute for Advanced Computer Studies TR-97-02 Department of Computer Science  
Pubnum: TR-3864  
Abstract: The adjoint A A of a matrix A is the transpose of the matrix of the cofactors of the elements of A. The computation of the adjoint from its definition involves the computation of n 2 determinants of order (n 1) | a prohibitively expensive O(n 4 ) process. On the other had the computation from the formula A A = det(A)A 1 breaks down when A is singular and is potentially unstable when A is ill-conditioned. In this paper we first show that the aj-doint can be perfectly conditioned, even when A is ill-conditioned. We then show that if due care is taken the adjoint can be accurately computed from the inverse, even when the latter has been inaccurately computed. In an appendix to this paper we establish a folk result on the accuracy of computed inverses. fl This report is available by anonymous ftp from thales.cs.umd.edu in the directory pub/reports or on the web at http://www.cs.umd.edu/ stewart/. y Department of Computer Science and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Mary-land, College Park, MD 20742.

The fact the X- and Y-factors in the decompositions of xx3-4 are either well-conditioned (i.e., orthogonal) or triangular, may account for the difficulty the author had in constructing counterexamples.
