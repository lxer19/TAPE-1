Abstract: Just as input to state stability (iss) generalizes the idea of finite gains with respect to supremum norms, the new notion of integral input to state stability (iiss) generalizes the concept of finite gain when using an integral norm on inputs. In this paper, we obtain a necessary and sufficient characterization of the iiss property, expressed in terms of dissipation inequalities.

Reference-contexts: : [0; T ] ! R 0 is any absolutely continuous function that satisfies the differential inequality _q 1 (q) 2 (2q) almost everywhere, then it must be the case that q (t) fi (q (0); t) for all t 2 [0; T ]. (See for instance Lemma 4.4 in <ref> [11] </ref>; the statement in that reference applies to q defined on all of [0; 1), but exactly the same proof works for a finite interval. <p> Hence, ff 1 (jx (t)j) V (x (t)) fi (V (0); t) + 0 fi (ff 2 (jx (0)j); t) + 0 for all t 0, and so the sufficiency proof is complete. Proof of 1)2 in Theorem 1 We first remark that the proof of Lemma 3.1 in <ref> [11] </ref> can be used to show the following: Lemma 3.6 For each given KL-function fi, there exists a family of mappings fT r g r&gt;0 with: * for each fixed r &gt; 0, T r : R &gt;0 onto ! R &gt;0 is continuous and is strictly decreasing; * for each <p> is iiss, then there exists a smooth K 1 -function ' such that system (18) is forward complete, that is, x ' (t; ~; d) is defined for all t 0, all ~ 2 R n , and all d 2 M. 2 Because of forward completeness, this follows from <ref> [11] </ref> (c.f. Propositions 5.1 and 5.5 of [11]): Lemma 3.8 Assume system (1) is iiss, and let ' be given as in Lemma 3.7. <p> K 1 -function ' such that system (18) is forward complete, that is, x ' (t; ~; d) is defined for all t 0, all ~ 2 R n , and all d 2 M. 2 Because of forward completeness, this follows from <ref> [11] </ref> (c.f. Propositions 5.1 and 5.5 of [11]): Lemma 3.8 Assume system (1) is iiss, and let ' be given as in Lemma 3.7. <p> By Theorem B.1 in <ref> [11] </ref>, one sees that there exists a continuous function V 2 , smooth on R n n f0g, such that ff (j~j) V 2 (~) 2 ff 2 (j~j); 8 ~ 2 R n ; DV 2 (~)f (~; '(j~j)) 2 for all ~ 6= 0, all jj 1. <p> By Proposition 4.2 in <ref> [11] </ref>, one sees that there exists some smooth K 1 -function p such that p 0 (s) &gt; 0 for all s &gt; 0 and p ffi V 2 is smooth everywhere. Without loss of 11 generality, one may assume that p 0 (s) 1 for all s &gt; 0. <p> Again one direction of the implication is easy to prove by the Lyapunov direct method applied to system (1) for u = 0. The reverse is more interesting. Assume (1) is 0-gas. Then we have f (0; 0) = 0, and by a converse Lyapunov argument (see e.g. <ref> [11] </ref>), there exist a smooth V : R n ! R and functions ff 1 ; ff 2 ; ff 3 in K 1 such that ff 1 (j~j) V (~) ff 2 (j~j) (25) DV (~)f (~; 0) ff 3 (j~j): (26) Consider now the following function: ~fl (r; s)

Reference-contexts: Remark 3.11 The same result can also be obtained along different lines, exploiting a result appeared in <ref> [16] </ref>. It is shown there that the 0-gas property for system (1) implies the existence of an everywhere nonzero smooth function G (x) such that _x = f (x; G (x)v) is iss with respect to v.

Reference-contexts: stability with respect to input perturbations. (For linear systems, similar considerations led to the development of gains and the operator-theoretic approach, including the formulation, when using L 2 norms, of H 1 control.) One candidate for such a formulation is the property called "input to state stability" (iss), introduced in <ref> [17] </ref>. ISS differs fundamentally from the operator-theoretic notions, among others in two respects: (1) it takes account of initial states in a manner fully compatible with Lyapunov stability, and (2) it replaces finite linear gains, which represent far too strong a requirement for general nonlinear operators, with "nonlinear gains". <p> The area of input-to-output (as opposed to input-to-state) stability deals with properties which may be described, informally, as "small inputs produce small outputs." Such properties appear naturally in regulation problems. In particular, one may define a concept of ios (input-to-output stability), see <ref> [17] </ref> and [22]. This is yet another obvious candidate for the replacement of sup norms 18 by integrals.

Reference-contexts: It gives no useful bounds in the situation in which inputs u () are unbounded but still have in some sense "finite energy". In <ref> [18] </ref>, a new notion, of integral input to state stability, iiss for short, was introduced, to model the statement: "no matter what is the initial state, if integrals of the inputs are small, then the state must eventually be small". <p> Motivation: Finite-Gain under Coordinate Changes In closing this introduction, we wish to explain briefly how the notion of iiss arises in an extremely natural manner when generalizing linear L 2 to L 1 gains (sometimes called "H 2 gains") to nonlinear systems. (See also <ref> [18] </ref>, which explains why, when we apply the same reasoning to "L 2 to L 2 stability" or to "L 1 to L 1 stability," we recover input to state stability.) For linear systems, one defines finite-gain stability, with respect to square norm on inputs and sup norm on states, by <p> This is precisely as in the estimate (3), except that fi has what appears to be a very special form. Surprisingly, however, any KL function fi can be majorized by a function of this special form, see <ref> [18] </ref>, so indeed one obtains the general notion of iiss with this reasoning. 5 3 Main Proofs The following Lemma will be needed several times during the proofs. Lemma 3.1 Let : R 0 ! R 0 be a continuous positive definite function. <p> Then, there exists some function k 2 N such that c (x; y) k (x) + k (y) This result generalizes the one given in <ref> [18] </ref>, which applied only to functions of the form c (x; y) = g (x + y) with g 2 N .

Reference-contexts: Moreover, this concept has many equivalent versions, which indicates that it is mathematically natural: there are characterizations in terms of dissipation, robustness margins, and classical Lyapunov-like functions; see e.g. <ref> [19, 20] </ref>. Informally, the iss property translates into the statement: "no matter what is the initial state, if the inputs are uniformly small, then the state must eventually be small". <p> Notice the difference between Definition 2.2 and the dissipation characterization of iss (cf. <ref> [19, 20] </ref>): the iss property is equivalent to the existence of a V as here but for which ff 3 is required to be unbounded (in fact, class K 1 ).

Reference-contexts: function, or if it has an output which makes the system dissipative and weakly zero-detectable or if it is 0-gas and zero-output dissipative. 2 Remark 2.4 We used the adjective "weak" when defining zero-detectability in order to distinguish this notion from true detectability, or "(zero-input) output to state stability", cf. <ref> [21] </ref> and also Section 6 below, where one asks that "small output (when u 0) implies small state", as opposed to merely asking that "zero output implies small state" as here. 2 A Characterization of 0-GAS Control Systems In the proof Theorem 1, we utilize the following characterization of 0-gas systems. <p> If (40) holds for every trajectory of (39), then we say that system (39) is integral input-output-to-state stable (iioss). This is a notion of detectability: inputs and outputs are "small" implies that states are also small; see <ref> [21] </ref> for the corresponding notion of (sup-norm) ioss.
