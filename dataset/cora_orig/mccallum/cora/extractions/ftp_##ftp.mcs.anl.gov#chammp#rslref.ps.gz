Reference-contexts: RSL is a parallel runtime system library developed at Argonne National Laboratory that is tailored to regular-grid atmospheric models with nesting. It was used with Fortran90 to parallelize a well-known and widely used regional weather model, the Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model MM5 <ref> [1] </ref>. It is similar to efforts of a number of other groups: Comlib [2], LPARX [3], and NNT/SMS [5] in that it provides high-level, efficient mechanisms for performing data parallel computations over multiple interelated grids.

Like the LAPRX software abstractions, RSL is able to support dynamic load balancing, efficient inter-grid communication, irregularly shaped logical domains and irregularly shaped processor sub-domains.
