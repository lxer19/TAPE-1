Abstract: Classically, decomposition of mixed pixels is based on a linear mixture model that attributes deviations to random statistical noise. In order to utilise the existing correlations between neighbouring pixels, which cannot be described in this statistical model, we developed a model in which deviations are attributed to physical factors with a long length scale. Experiments on semi-real data showed that the proportions of mixed pixels can be estimated more accurately by solving the physical instead of the statistical linear mixture model. In addition, solving the physical model provides an estimate of the pixel's component spectra not supplied by the statistical model, which may be an important feature for some applications.

Reference-contexts: All artificial images were made using only two templates at the same time, while the number of bands was reduced from six to two or three. In most cases bands 3 and 5 (plus band 7 for n=3) were selected, because they provided the best discrimination between vegetation types <ref> (Sabins 1987) </ref>. The only exceptions were two images created with templates A 0 and C 0 , which were derived from the six band templates A and C by selecting bands 1 and 2 (plus band 4 in case n=3).

Reference-contexts: provide a solution in the last case, Horwitz et al. (1971) added an error term to the basic mixing equations, which resulted in the statistical linear mixture model: x = Mf + e: (4) The (nx1) error vector e, which can be regarded as random noise received by the sensor <ref> (Settle and Drake 1993) </ref>, is assumed to have a multivariate normal distribution with a zero mean and a variance-covariance matrix N f that depends on the pixel's composition. <p> Satisfaction of the positivity constraint is much harder to enforce, and requires either an entirely different method of solution or a separate post-processing step. A simple post-processing approach is to set any negative fractions to zero and rescale the proportions vector <ref> (Settle and Drake 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The f that solve this system are the eigen-vectors of matrix A, which can be calculated in a straightforward fashion <ref> (see Strang 1980) </ref>.
