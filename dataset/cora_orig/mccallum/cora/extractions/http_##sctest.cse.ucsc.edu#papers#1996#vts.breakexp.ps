Abstract: We present the experimental evidence, for the first time, that the die surface can act as an RC interconnect, becoming an important factor in determining the voltage of a floating wire created by a CMOS open. We present a circuit model for this effect verified with HSPICE simulations. A detailed analysis of potential mechanisms behind this phenomenon is provided. We also present our measurement results for the trapped charge deposited on floating gates during fabrication.

More than 40 years ago, Brattain and Bardeen <ref> [1] </ref> discovered that gas adsorption onto a semiconductor surface changes the conductance of that surface. This is the operating principle for many semiconducting gas and humidity detectors today [12].

Reference-contexts: In the HP 0.8 technology our chips were fabricated with, two passivation layers are used. First, a 0.35 silicon oxynitride film is deposited on top of the metal-3 layer, followed by a 0.60 silicon nitride film. Rabiller et al. <ref> [3] </ref> reported that the room temperature resistivity varies smoothly from less than 10 14 cm for silicon nitride to more than 10 16 cm for silicon dioxide by varying the ratios of oxygen and nitrogen in a silicon oxynitride film deposited using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). <p> Because metal-2 might be slightly closer to the die surface than it is to the substrate in this 3-metal process, and the dielectric constant is 7.0 for silicon nitride and between 3.9 and 7.0 for silicon oxynitride depending on its oxygen-nitrogen composition <ref> [3] </ref>, we assumed C fwsurf to be 30fF. We estimated the values of C ringsurf and C surf to be 4400fF and 200fF, respectively, as described in our technical report [7].

Reference-contexts: The following day, the Vdd-ring effect has completely disappeared. This was an evidence that air entering the die cavity has something to do with this phenomenon. We learned from MOSIS <ref> [4] </ref> that in the case of hermetic sealing the packages are placed in a closed oven, where the chips are cleared of moisture at a tempera-ture of 150 ffi C by passing dry nitrogen through the oven.

Reference-contexts: This charge is important, because it is one of the factors that determine the voltage on a floating gate [11] [2] [9] [5] [13], thus determining the behavior of the faulty cell this floating-gate transistor is in. Johnson <ref> [6] </ref> performed trapped charge measurements on test structures that consist of floating-gate p-channel and n-channel transistors with varying lengths of poly extensions. These measurements showed that there was always a positive charge on the floating poly, and the voltage created by this charge ranged from 0.1V to 2.3V. <p> In this state, the measured gate voltage on the reference transistor will be the same as the gate voltage on the floating-gate transistor. This method is also used by Johnson <ref> [6] </ref>, but our measurement technique shown in thus eliminating the hot electron effect that might otherwise alter the amount of the trapped charge [7]. The op-amps in Figure 1 also make sure that the same current is flowing through both transistors. <p> These metal wires are not surrounded by any other wire, that is, we can control the floating-gate voltage only by controlling the source-drain voltage. This is also the technique used by Johnson <ref> [6] </ref>. Figure 2 shows our measurement circuitry for this technique. A similar circuit is also used by Pricket et al. [10]. <p> So, as the floating wire gets closer to the die surface, it becomes more influenced by the voltage change on the Vdd-ring, which supports our die surface conduction speculation. It does not surprise us that Johnson <ref> [6] </ref> has not reported any such phenomenon, because all of the poly extensions in his F G transistors were covered by metal lines connected to transistor drains or sources, which shielded the poly extensions from the die surface. <p> One main conclusion from our measurements is that floating gate transistors with no or some poly extensions have negative trapped charge voltages sitting on their gates, up to almost -4V. This is in contrast with Johnson's measurements <ref> [6] </ref>, who measured always positive charge on his floating gate transistors, which also had some or no poly extensions. This clearly shows the fabrication process dependence of the trapped charge polarity.

The op-amps in Figure 1 also make sure that the same current is flowing through both transistors. We refer to the voltage on the floating gate when all the chip pins are grounded as the trapped charge voltage. <p> V tc is the trapped charge voltage, and V ds is the drain-source voltage, which is kept fixed at 0.2V. We explain in our technical report <ref> [7] </ref> that K2 fl 0:2 is less than 15mV, which is a negligible value. The value of K1 changes slightly as the transistor enters the linear region from the cut-off region, introducing a small positive extrapolation error, which is around 0.13V worst case in our experiments [7]. voltage controlled by pg <p> in our technical report <ref> [7] </ref> that K2 fl 0:2 is less than 15mV, which is a negligible value.

No metal is attached to these floating gates, and the width of the poly is 1. <p> Table 1 summarizes the twelve floating-gate (FG) transistors we used. The measurement technique for transistor 6 is similar to the one used for p-channel transistors, because the setup for transistor 6 does not have a pg node. The extrapolation error for our p-channel experiments is between -0.07V and -0.47V <ref> [7] </ref> going from transistor 7 to 12, assuming that V tc = 0. <p> Moreover, a substantial portion of the charge traveling through the nitride path will be kept by the surface-to-substrate capacitances shown in Figure 3, thus delaying the RC charge-up of the floating wire, which is not the case for the oxide path. Our technical report <ref> [7] </ref> includes HSPICE simulation results confirming that the nitride is too resistive to be responsible for the Vdd-ring effect. 4.2 Is It the Dry Nitrogen and Air? Another candidate for the medium of charge transport on or over the die surface is the gas inside the die cavity. <p> We estimated the values of C ringsurf and C surf to be 4400fF and 200fF, respectively, as described in our technical report <ref> [7] </ref>. The RC network between the floating wire and the Vdd-ring corresponds to an 135 surface distance for transistor 8, but more surface area will be receiving induced charge from the Vdd-ring.

Reference-contexts: In a modern IC, most of the area is taken by the metal interconnect. Therefore, the likelihood of a break in the interconnect is greater than the one inside a cell. Moreover, not all breaks inside a cell create floating-gate transistors. They may create, for instance, network breaks <ref> [8] </ref>. In addition to measuring the trapped charge, we also wanted to try erasing this charge via ultra-violet light as is done for EPROMs.
