Abstract: This paper describes an approach for automatically decomposing a problem into subproblems and then automatically discovering reusable subroutines, and a way of assembling the results produced by these subroutines in order to solve a problem. The approach uses genetic programming with automatic function definition. Genetic programming provides a way to genetically breed a computer program to solve a problem. Automatic function definition enables genetic programming to define potentially useful subroutines dynamically during a run. The approach is applied to an illustrative problem. Genetic programming with automatic function definition reduced the computational effort required to learn a solution to the problem by a factor of 2.0 as compared to genetic programming without automatic function definition. Similarly, the average structural complexity of the solution was reduced by about 21%. Conventional approaches to machine learning usually require that the user hand-craft reusable subroutines for key features in the problem environment. Conventional approaches often additionally require the user to specify in advance the size and shape of the eventual way of combining the subroutines into a compete solution. However, in many instances, finding the reusable subroutines and a way of combining the subroutines in order to solve the problem really is the problem. Indeed, the necessity for pre-identification of the particular components of solutions and the necessity for predetermination of a way of combining these components has been recognized as a bane of machine learning starting with Samuel's groundbreaking work in machine learning involving learning to play the game of checkers [Samuel 1959].
