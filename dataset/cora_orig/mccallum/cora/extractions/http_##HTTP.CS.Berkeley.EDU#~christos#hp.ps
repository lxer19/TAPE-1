Reference-contexts: We were recently informed that, independently, Berger and Leighton <ref> [1] </ref> proved that the three-dimensional protein folding problem in the H-P model is NP-complete; in fact, the approximability implications of their result are stronger than ours. 2 The multistring folding problem The two-dimensional lattice is the graph, (Z 2 ; L), with node set Z 2 (all points in the Euclidean <p> Thus the intended folding has a total of 4E + 8 losses, and the steps in establishing the converse are analogous to the ones in the present proof. The same result was proven independently, and a few months earlier, by Berger and Leighton <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It is assumed in this model that the native folded state is the one that maximizes score. It is therefore an interesting problem, given a sequence of 0s and 1s, to 1 Chan and Dill <ref> [2] </ref> state that "for chain lengths for which exhaustive enumeration is possible (up to about 30 monomers), two-dimensional models more accurately represent the physically important surface-interior ratios of proteins than do three-dimensional models." 1 find the embedding on the lattice that maximizes score.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps the most successful and best-studied such model, and the one with apparently the best match with experiments 1 , is the two-dimensional hydrophilic-hydrophobic model, or H-P model, proposed by Dill <ref> [3] </ref>. In this model it is assumed that the protein is a sequence of 0s and 1s, and folding entails embedding the sequence in the two-dimensional lattice (see Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: It seems clear that the forces underlying protein folding are the interactions between their monomers; recently, the view that non-local interactions dominate this process has been gaining ground <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> This view quickly leads to a puzzling aspect of the problem, known as Levinthal's paradox, which can be paraphrased as follows "How can a folding protein choose so quickly among so many possible foldings the one with minimum energy?" <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: There have been several NP-completeness results related to protein folding in the literature. A few years ago, several authors pointed out that certain general restatements of the problem, in which monomers attract or repel each other in ways that are general and can be used in encoding, are NP-complete <ref> [5, 10, 13] </ref>. More interestingly, it was proved in [11] that a combinatorial generalization of the H-P model to an infinite alphabet, of which one symbol is neutral like H-P's 0 symbol, and the score counts the number of adjacencies of elements with the same symbol, is NP-complete.

Reference-contexts: The present result is the first to settle the complexity of the simple two-dimensional H-P model actually proposed in the literature as the ultimate simplification of the protein folding problem. The H-P problem has been attacked from the point of view of approximation algorithms <ref> [6] </ref>; the present result sheds little light on this aspect of the problem, as our reduction is not in any interesting way approximation-preserving. Our reduction is from the Hamilton cycle problem.

Reference-contexts: See Figure 3 for an example. Theorem 2 The Hamilton cycle problem remains NP-complete even if restricted to special planar graphs. Proof: The reduction from exact cover to planar Hamilton cycle in <ref> [7] </ref> produces a special planar graph, if the 2-input and 3-input "or" gadgets are replaced by the ones shown in Figure 4.

Reference-contexts: It is in general reasonably stable and unique. The mapping from DNA sequences to monomer sequences is simple and very well-understood. In contrast, the mapping from the sequence of a protein to the geometric configuration of its native state |the "second half of the genetic code" <ref> [8] </ref>| is much more intricate and complex, and less understood; it has been the subject of intense investigation for decades. It seems clear that the forces underlying protein folding are the interactions between their monomers; recently, the view that non-local interactions dominate this process has been gaining ground [4].

Reference-contexts: More interestingly, it was proved in [11] that a combinatorial generalization of the H-P model to an infinite alphabet, of which one symbol is neutral like H-P's 0 symbol, and the score counts the number of adjacencies of elements with the same symbol, is NP-complete. More recently, <ref> [9] </ref> improved this to a finite, albeit very large alphabet. The present result is the first to settle the complexity of the simple two-dimensional H-P model actually proposed in the literature as the ultimate simplification of the protein folding problem.

Reference-contexts: We then proceed to establish the result for a single sequence, by resorting to certain interesting variants of the planar Hamilton cycle problem (Theorem 3 in Section 3). In our proof we utilize an idea of Trevisan <ref> [12] </ref>, whereby graphs can be embedded in the hypercube so that adjacency is captured by Hamming distance. Our proof captures one of the basic intuitions of the H-P model, namely that hydrophobic monomers 2 will tend to form a large "sphere" (in the two-dimensional lattice, a large hydrophobic square). <p> or less, and two nodes v 1 ; v n 2 V , is there a Hamilton path from v 1 to v n ? As a preliminary step in our reduction, we first map the nodes in G to the hypercube according to a map used by Trevisan in <ref> [12] </ref>.
