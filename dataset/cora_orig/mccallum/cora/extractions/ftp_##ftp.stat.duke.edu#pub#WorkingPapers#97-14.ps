Title: Evaluation and Comparison of EEG Traces: Latent Structure in Nonstationary Time Series  
Author: Mike WEST, Raquel PRADO, and Andrew KRYSTAL 
Keyword: KEY WORDS: Bayesian inference; Dynamic latent factors; Dynamic linear models; Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT); Elec-troencephalographic (EEG) time series; Time:Frequency analysis; Time series decomposition; Time-varying autoregressions  
Abstract: We explore and illustrate the use of time series decomposition methods for evaluating and comparing latent structure in nonstationary electroencephalographic (EEG) traces obtained from depressed patients during brain seizures induced as part of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Analysis of the patterns of change over time in the frequency structure of such EEG data provides insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms of action of this effective but poorly understood antidepressant treatment, and allows clinicians to modify ECT treatments to optimize therapeutic benefits while minimizing associated side-effects. Our work has introduced new methods of time:frequency analysis of EEG series that identify the complete pattern of time evolution of frequency structure over the course of a seizure, and usefully assist in these scientific and clinical studies. New methods of decomposition of flexible dynamic models provide time domain decompositions of individual EEG series into collections of latent components in different frequency bands. This allows us to explore ECT seizure characteristics via inferences on the time-varying parameters that characterize these latent components, and to relate differences in such characteristics across seizures to differences in the therapeutic effectiveness and cognitive side-effects of those seizures. This article discusses the scientific context and problems, development of nonstationary time series models and new methods of decomposition to explore time:frequency structure, and aspects of model fitting and analysis. We include applied studies on two data sets from recent clinical ECT studies. One is an initial illustrative analysis of a single EEG trace, the second compares the EEG data recorded during two types of ECT treatment that differ in therapeutic effectiveness and cognitive side-effects. The uses of these models and time series decomposition methods in extracting and contrasting key features of the seizure underlying the EEG signals are highlighted in these studies. Through the use of these models we have quantified, for the first time, decreases in the dominant frequencies of low frequency EEG components during ECT seizures. We have also identified preliminary evidence that such decreases are enhanced under the more effective ECTs at higher electrical dosages, a finding that is consistent with prior reports and the hypothesis that more effective forms of ECT are more potent at eliciting neurophysiological inhibitory processes.

Our methods isolate and estimate latent subseries that may be interpreted as representing brain wave activity in various nominal frequency bands, and whose time-varying parameters characterize the effects of the seizure on activity in these bands.

Reference-contexts: (1983) and Kitagawa and Gersch (1985), relate closely to nonparametric methods of "evolutionary" spectral analysis using spectral estimates based on moving data "windows" (originating from Priestley 1965), though TVAR methods have proven much more widely useful in adapting to both smooth and more abrupts changes through time in spectral characteristics <ref> (see discussion in Kitagawa and Gersch 1996, section 11.3) </ref>. Our methods may be viewed as natural extension of the TVAR literature that both complements and extends methodology in practically important directions.

Reference-contexts: Comparisons of such characteristics across EEG channels and between seizures under different ECT protocols provides novel insights into both basic scientific and clinical issues. Time series decomposition methodology is based on extensions of existing time series decomposition theory <ref> (West 1997a) </ref> to time-varying parameter models. The new theoretical results underlying the methodology arise in general classes of dynamic linear models (DLMs) of which TVAR models form a very important subclass. In Section 2 we introduce TVAR models and describe the decomposition structure and theory.

Reference-contexts: Our decomposition theory applies at that level of generality. The central decomposition result arises simply from standard theory of model structure and the notions of similar models in linear stochastic systems <ref> (West and Harrison 1997, chapter 5) </ref>. <p> Before moving to aspects of model fitting and analysis, we note that the TVAR model characterizes all DLMs with time-varying G t matrices of distinct eigenvalues in the same way that standard AR models characterize the class of similar constant DLMs having the same set of distinct eigenvalues <ref> (West and Harrison 1997, chapters 5 and 6) </ref>. Thus, in a real applied sense, these models essentially encompass the class of practically interesting time-varying state space models with distinct eigenvalues. West/Prado/Krystal, July 7, 1998 5 3. <p> We adopt traditional random walk models for these evolutions, and so provide for estimation and adaptation to changing structure through time without anticipating specific directions of changes <ref> (West and Harrison 1997 chapter 3, section 9.6 and 10.8) </ref>.
