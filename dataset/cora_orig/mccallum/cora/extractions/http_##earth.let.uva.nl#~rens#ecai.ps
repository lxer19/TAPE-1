Title: A Data-Oriented Approach to Semantic Interpretation  
Author: Rens Bod Remko Bonnema and Remko Scha 
Abstract: In Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP), an annotated language corpus is used as a stochastic grammar. The most probable analysis of a new input sentence is constructed by combining sub-analyses from the corpus in the most probable way. This approach has been succesfully used for syntactic analysis, using corpora with syntactic annotations such as the Penn Treebank. If a corpus with semantically annotated sentences is used, the same approach can also generate the most probable semantic interpretation of an input sentence. The present paper explains this semantic interpretation method, and summarizes the results of a preliminary experiment. Semantic annotations were added to the syntactic annotations of most of the sentences of the ATIS corpus. A data-oriented semantic interpretation algorithm was succesfully tested on this semantically enriched corpus.

Reference-contexts: For the syntactic dimension of language understanding, various instantiations of this Data-Oriented approach have been worked out (e.g. Bod, 1992-1996; Sima'an, 1995-1996). A method for extending it to the semantic domain was first suggested by <ref> (van den Berg et al., 1994) </ref>. In the present paper we discuss a computationally effective version of that method, and an implemented system that used it. We first summarize the Data-Oriented Parsing method now.

Reference-contexts: For our exposition in this paper we will use a wellknown standard formalism: extensional type theory (see Gamut, 1991), i.e., a higher-order logical language that combines lambda-abstraction with connectives and quantifiers. The only currently implemented system for data-oriented semantic interpretation <ref> (Bonnema, 1996) </ref> uses a different logical language, however.

Reference-contexts: There are also two-place functions, such as flights, distances and travel-times which take pairs of cities as arguments. Maintaining the traditional linguistic semantic representations for sentences involving functional nouns is not impossible, but it does create complexities that one may want to avoid <ref> (cf. De Bruin and Scha, 1988) </ref>. For this reason, Bonnema used nonstandard semantic annotations, and a new logical language with additional set-theoretical operations, that facilitate representing the meanings of complex sentences with plural function-nouns ("the fares of the flights from Boston to the West Coast cities").

Reference-contexts: Then we show that this method can be straightforwardly extended into a semantic analysis method, if a corpus is used in which the trees are enriched with semantic annotations.

We summarize his results here. The semantic formalism To provide the ATIS corpus with semantic annotations, Bonnema used a higher-order logical language that differs in certain ways from the standard higher-order logic we used in the examples above.
