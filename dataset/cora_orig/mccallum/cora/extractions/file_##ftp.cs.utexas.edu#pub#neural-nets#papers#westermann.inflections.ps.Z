Abstract: The emerging function of verb inflections in German language acquisition is modeled with a connectionist network. A network that is initially presented only with a semantic representation of sentences uses the inflectional verb ending -t to mark those sentences that are low in transitivity, whereas all other verb endings occur randomly. This behavior matches an early stage in German language acquisition where verb endings encode a similar semantic rather than a grammatical function. When information about the surface structure of the sentence is added to the input data, the network learns to use the correct verb inflections in a process very similar to children's learning. This second phase is facilitated by the semantic phase, suggesting that there is no shift from semantic to grammatical encoding, but rather an extension of the initial semantic encoding to include grammatical information. This can be seen as evidence for the strong version of the functionalist hypothesis of language acquisition.

Reference-contexts: Experiments There is strong evidence that inflectional affixes are attached to words as needed during speech production <ref> (Aitchison, 1987) </ref>. The neural network used in our experiments is intended to model only the specific part of the human language production system which is responsible for this process. The input to the network comes from other parts of the language production system.

Reference-contexts: This seems to indicate that there is no developmental shift from a semantic to a grammatical encoding, but instead learning is based on extending the semantic encoding to include surface-structure information. This result provides a computational justification for the strong version of the functionalist hypothesis of language acquisition <ref> (Bates and MacWhinney, 1979) </ref>, which states that semantic and pragmatic representations are instrumental in learning grammatical concepts. Below, the German verb inflection paradigm is first briefly reviewed, and Clahsen's observations on how children acquire it are outlined. <p> Useful features such as kinesis and volitionality serve as a good starting point, and the network learns to concentrate on the first word (i.e the subject) in a sentence faster. This can be seen as evidence for the strong version of the functionalist hypothesis of language acquisition <ref> (Bates and MacWhinney, 1979) </ref>. In contrast to theories postulating autonomous syntax (e.g., Chomsky, 1975), this hypothesis maintains that "grammatical forms are `determined' and `maintained' by [: : : ] communicative functions and processing constraints. <p> The strong version leads to a developmental model in which children discover the structure of grammar through their experience with competing communicative factors" <ref> (Bates and MacWhinney, 1979, p. 174) </ref>. Specifically, "The strong functionalist view predicts that children will show evidence for the intention to encode agent and/or topic before they evidence control of the surface role of subject" (p. 189).

Reference-contexts: Yet the relation between the transitivity of a sentence and the inflectional ending is not entirely arbitrary. In the in put data, as in real speech <ref> (Clahsen, 1986) </ref>, -t occurs more often with sentences of low transitivity. The network learns to exploit these correlations, even amplify them. No such correlations exist for the other verb endings, or the other levels of transitivity, and the other verb endings are generated seemingly randomly. <p> Thus, -t appears to be the best choice in regard to what the children are looking for, since -t often refers to inanimate subjects in the adult language, and, moreover, -t does not necessarily encode agents" <ref> (Clahsen, 1986, p. 113) </ref>. And in (Clahsen, 1988, p. 100): "The child finds in the input data frequent confirmation for the equation ...-t = [+intransitive] [...]. For the case ...-(en) = [-intransitive] children find less evidence, because transitive verbs can occur with different grammatical subjects.

Reference-contexts: This is particularly interesting because it seems to comply with the functionalist notion of agency. In func tional grammar, agency is restricted to an entity controlling an action that has the features [+dynamic] and [+controlled] <ref> (Dik, 1978) </ref>. In our experiments, kinesis and volitionality carry similar meaning, and therefore it seems that the network learns to use the implicit semantic property of agency to help determine the inflectional ending of the verb.
