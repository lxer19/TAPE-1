Abstract: University of Utah Technical Report UUCS-98-007 Also available (with better pictures) in http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/sim/glue/ Abstract One key function of graphics systems is to present information about the 3-D structure of modeled environments. For real-time simulations, conveying a sense of contact between touching surfaces and relative position and motion between proximate objects is particularly critical. Neither stereo nor occlusion cues are completely effective for such fine judgments. Conventional wisdom often argues that shadows play a critical role. Less often, it is argued that interreflection also contributes to the sense that two surfaces are touching. This paper explores the actual utility of shadows and inter-reflection in signaling contact and suggests how this information can be exploited in real-time rendering systems to glue objects to surfaces.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Every opaque body is surrounded and its whole surface enveloped in shadow and light. Leonardo da Vinci <ref> [1] </ref> Leonardo wrote at length about the relationships between light sources, objects, and shadows. He also described the phenomenon we now call interreflection.

Reference-contexts: More recently, methods have been developed for computationally simulating light transport with sufficient fidelity to produce physically correct images of synthetic scenes <ref> [2] </ref>. While the physics of shadows and interreflections are now well understood, we know much less about their perceptual effects. One reason for this is the difficulty of constructing controlled experiments involving shadows and indirect illumination.

Reference-contexts: Gilchrist, in discussing how to analyze how the vision system might decouple illumination, albedo, and luminance, muses about some sort of magical filter that could filter out all light that had been reflected off a surface . . . more than once <ref> [3] </ref>.

Computational analyses of the information about surface shape conveyed by interreflections have been done [1417], but these results do not directly address the determination of spatial organization.

Reference-contexts: The answer to this too will come as something of a surprise. The accuracy with which shadows need to be rendered in order to convey a sense of position in a larger spatial environment is highly variable, depending on the specific circumstances. Sometimes, soft shadows are important <ref> [8] </ref>, other times they are not [9, 20]. When common motion of object and shadow is present, the actual appearance of the shadow seems almost irrelevant, with patterns that would never be confused for a shadow on their own sufficing perfectly well [9].

Reference-contexts: This effect is common in real-time applications and can even occur in some realistic rendering algorithms such as radiosity. Current solutions to this problem rely on explicitly adding fairly accurate shadows, either through real-time shadow techniques <ref> [18] </ref> or discontinuity meshing for radiosity [19]. These approaches tend to be computationally expensive. We show that interreflections as well as shadows can be used to significantly reduce the problem of floating objects by gluing them to the surface they lie on.

The photometric details of these shadows have been studied extensively in the case of diffuse luminaires illuminating diffuse reflectors <ref> [19] </ref>. 2 Corresponding terminology has not developed for interreflection effects. For interreflections involving light diffusely reflecting from an object surface onto another, extended surface, contact is signaled by the lightening associated with the interreflection being adjacent to the directly illuminated surface.
