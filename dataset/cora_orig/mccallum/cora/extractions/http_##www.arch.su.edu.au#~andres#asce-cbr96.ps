Title: Design Case Adaptation Using Genetic Algorithms  
Author:  Maher and Gmez de Silva Garza Mary Lou Maher and Andrs Gmez de Silva Garza 
Abstract: In order to adapt past experiences to new situations, case-based reasoning algorithms generally rely on domain knowledge and heuristics. Unfortunately, the amount of domainspecific knowledge and domain and taskspecific heuristics needed for such case adaptation is usually quite large. In contrast, in our current work we are exploring the use of a knowledge-lean method based on genetic algorithms for the subtask of case adaptation. We are applying these ideas to the domain of structural design of tall buildings.

Case Adaptation Using A Genetic Algorithm A genetic algorithm starts with a population of genotypes as the basis for generating high performance solutions to a specific problem. This initial population of genotypes is a case base in our application.
