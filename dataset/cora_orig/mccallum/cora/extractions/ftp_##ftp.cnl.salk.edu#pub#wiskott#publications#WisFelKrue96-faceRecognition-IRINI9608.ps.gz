Reference-contexts: Some research in this direction has, for example, been done by Lanitis et al. (1995). When determined with sufficient reliability, graph topography can itself be used as a basis for recognition <ref> (cf. Brunelli & Poggio 1993) </ref>. In (Wiskott 1996) the bunch graph technique has been used to fairly reliably determine facial attributes from single images, such as gender or the presence of glasses or a beard.

Reference-contexts: Gabor wavelets are biologically motivated convolution kernels in the shape of plane waves restricted by a Gaussian envelope function <ref> (Daugman 1988) </ref>. The set of convolution coefficients for kernels of different orientations and frequencies at one image pixel is called a jet.

Reference-contexts: The first stage, called normalization stage and described in greater detail in <ref> (Kr uger et al. 1995) </ref>, has the purpose of estimating the position and size of the face in IR-INI 96-08, c fl 1996 Institut fur Neuroinformatik, Ruhr-Universitat Bochum, FRG 11 the original image, so that the image can be scaled and cut to standard size.

Reference-contexts: We select the graph that matches best, cut a frame of appropriate size around it from the image and resize it to 128fi128 pixels. The poses could be determined analogously <ref> (Kr uger et al. 1996) </ref>, but here the poses are assumed to be known. In our experiments, normalization took approximately 20 seconds on a SPARCstation 10-512 with a 50 MHz processor and identified face position and scale correctly in approximately 99% of the images.

Reference-contexts: A person is recognized correctly if the correct model yields the highest graph similarity, i.e., if it is of rank one. A confidence criterion on how reliably a person is recognized can easily be derived from the statistics of the ranking <ref> (see Lades et al. 1993) </ref>. However, we have restricted our results to unqualified recognition rates, which already give a good impression of system performance. 3 Experiments 3.1 Database The image galleries we used in our experiments are taken from the ARPA/ARL FERET database provided by the US Army Research Laboratory. <p> The performance is high on faces of same pose. Robustness against rotation in depth up to about 20 degrees has already been demonstrated with a previous version of the system <ref> (Lades et al. 1993) </ref>. The constraint of working with single images deprives the system from information necessary for invariance to rotation in depth. Therefore the system performance in recognizing people in unfamiliar poses is significantly degraded. <p> In the absence of easily distinguished features such as hairstyle, beard or glasses a similar result was obtained by Kalocsai et al. (1994). 4.1 Comparison to Previous Work In comparison to the system <ref> (Lades et al. 1993) </ref> on the basis of which we have developed the system presented here we have made several major modifications. <p> In a boot-strapping fashion, object-specific grids and object bunch graphs could be established by starting with a crude or general grid, such as utilized in <ref> (Lades et al. 1993) </ref>, to first recognize object classes and establish approximate correspondences between images within a class, on the basis of which more object-specific grids and bunch graphs could be formed in stages, a little bit reminiscent of the way in which we find precise image graphs in two stages

Reference-contexts: The creation of a new bunch graph is most easily based on image sequences, which contain many cues for grouping, segmentation, and detecting correspondences. The grouping of nodes for salient points on the basis of common motion has been demonstrated in <ref> (Manjunath et al. 1992) </ref>. Monitoring a rotating object by continuously applying EBGM can then reveal which nodes refer to corresponding fiducial points in different poses (cf. von der Malsburg & Reiser 1995; Maurer & von der Malsburg 1996).

Reference-contexts: It is then sensitive to partial occlusion or to object deformation. This problem has been dealt with by treating small image regions centered on fiducial points (eyes, nose, mouth) as additional pixel vectors from which to extract more features by PCA <ref> (Pentland et al. 1994) </ref>. These fiducial regions can easily be located by matching subspaces of a few PCs to the image.

Reference-contexts: A disadvantage of the large kernels is their sensitivity to background variations. It was shown, however, that if the object contour is known the influence of the background can be suppressed <ref> (P otzsch 1994) </ref>. <p> It is then sensitive to partial occlusion or to object deformation.

Reference-contexts: Especially the ability to reliably find surface points on an object can be useful, for instance when the issue is learning about local object properties <ref> (Shams & Spoelstra 1996) </ref>. One such local property is differential degree of robustness against disturbances. Kr uger et al. have developed a system for learning weights emphasizing the more discriminative nodes (Kr uger 1995; Kr uger et al. 1996).
