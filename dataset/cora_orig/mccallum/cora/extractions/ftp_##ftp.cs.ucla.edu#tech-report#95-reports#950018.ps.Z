Abstract: This paper studies the distribution of good solutions for the traveling salesman problem (TSP) on a well-known 532-city instance that has been solved optimally by Padberg and Rinaldi [16]. For each of five local search heuristics, solutions are obtained from 2,500 different random starting points. Comparisons of these solutions show that lower-cost solutions have a strong tendency to be both closer to the optimal tour and closer to other good solutions. (Distance between two solutions is defined in terms of the number of edges they have in common.) These results support the conjecture of Boese, Kahng and Muddu [3] that the solution spaces of TSP instances have a "globally convex" or "big valley" character. This observation was used by [3] to motivate a new multi-start strategy for global optimization called Adaptive Multi-Start

Reference-contexts: We have chosen this instance because (i) it represents a real-world geometric TSP instance; (ii) it is large enough to prove difficult for most heuristics to solve optimally; and (iii) its optimal tour is known, allowing us to compare heuristic solutions to the optimal solution.

(Note that high-cost local minima are ignored by our AMS heuristic in <ref> [3] </ref>.) For LSMC, the relationship appears to be quite strong again, although there is perhaps a second 4 (a) mean distance to the 2,499 other local minima and (b) distance to the global minimum. valley at a distance between 60 and 80 from the optimal tour. <p> Define a ball b (t; k) to be the subset of tours within distance k of a tour t. From the third column in Table 1, we see that all the tours found by the five heuristics are contained in b (t opt ; 233).

Reference-contexts: However, Hagen and Kahng [5] have shown for circuit partitioning at least, that this relationship deteriorates for lower-cost solutions (i.e., those produced by more powerful heuristics such as Fiduccia-Mattheyses <ref> [4] </ref>). In other problem formulations we also find weaker cost-distance relationships than in the TSP, although in some of them (e.g., job shop scheduling) the relationship becomes more apparent when we use better heuristics.

Reference-contexts: Understanding this cost surface can help both to explain the success of previous heuristics (e.g., simulated annealing) and to motivate new, more effective heuristics (e.g., multi-start strategies or better annealing schedules). Our results indicate that cost surfaces for the traveling salesman problem (TSP) exhibit a "globally convex" <ref> [6] </ref> or what we call a "big valley" structure. Figure 1 gives an intuitive picture of the big valley, in which the set of local minima appears convex with one central global minimum. <p> Moreover, the optimal tour is located at a more central position within the subspace of good solutions: the optimal tour is closer on average to the heuristic tours than are most of the heuristic tours themselves. This suggests a "globally convex" <ref> [6] </ref> or "big valley" structure for the TSP solution space, with the optimal solution near the center of a single valley of low-cost solutions.
