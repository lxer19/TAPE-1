Abstract: The problem to determine whether a given k-colored graph is a subgraph of a properly colored interval graph has an application in DNA physical mapping. In this paper, we study the problem for the case that the number of colors k is fixed. For k = 2, we give a simple linear time algorithm, for k = 3, we give an O(n 2 ) algorithm for biconnected graphs with n vertices, and for k = 4, we show that the problem is NP-complete.

We also show how the algorithm can be made constructive. ICG can also be solved in O (n 2 ) time for arbitrary three-colored graphs <ref> [BdF95] </ref>, but an expose of this algorithm, while extending the methods used in this paper for biconnected graphs, would take too much space here.

Reference-contexts: Also, they show ICG to be hard for the complexity class W [1], (which was strengthened in <ref> [BFH94] </ref> to hardness for all classes W [t], t 2 N). This result implies that it is unlikely that there exists a C, such that for any fixed number of colors k, ICG is solvable in time O (f (k)n C ). <p> Older results showed fixed parameter intractability <ref> [FHW93, BFH94] </ref>, but did not resolve the question. Our NP-completeness result resolves the open problem in a negative way (assuming P 6= NP). Theorem 5.1. ICG is NP-complete for four-colored graphs. 15 Proof. Clearly, ICG 2 NP. To prove NP-hardness, we transform from three-partition, which is strongly NP complete [GJ79].

Reference-contexts: ICG is closely related to Triangulating Colored Graphs (TCG) where we look for a properly colored triangulated supergraph G 0 of a k-colored input graph G (i.e., G 0 does not contain a chordless cycle of length at least four). This problem is known to be NP-complete <ref> [BFW92] </ref>, solvable in O (n k+1 ) time for fixed k [MWW94], and solvable in linear time for the cases k = 2 and k = 3 [BK93, IS93, KW92, NON94]. <p> Additionally, TCG with three colors is `finite state', while ICG with three colors is not (see <ref> [BFW92, FHW93] </ref>). A generalization of ICG is Intervalizing Sandwich Graphs (ISG).

Reference-contexts: This problem is known to be NP-complete [BFW92], solvable in O (n k+1 ) time for fixed k [MWW94], and solvable in linear time for the cases k = 2 and k = 3 <ref> [BK93, IS93, KW92, NON94] </ref>. Despite the close relationship between ICG and TCG, it appears that ICG poses some additional difficulties which require more complex and time consuming algorithms. <p> edges fv; wg 62 E such that there are three disjoint paths from v to w in G is called the cell completion of G. (Two paths from v to w are disjoint if they only have vertices v and w in common.) The following lemma has been proved in <ref> [BK93] </ref> in the setting of partial two-trees. Lemma 3.1. Let G be a partial two-path. <p> The cell completion of a partial two-path can be found in linear time <ref> [BK93] </ref>. In the cell completion of a graph, each two distinct chordless cycles have at most one edge in common. In [BK93], it has been shown that the cell completion of a biconnected partial two-tree is a tree of chordless cycles. <p> The cell completion of a partial two-path can be found in linear time <ref> [BK93] </ref>. In the cell completion of a graph, each two distinct chordless cycles have at most one edge in common. In [BK93], it has been shown that the cell completion of a biconnected partial two-tree is a tree of chordless cycles. We show that the cell completion of a biconnected partial two-path is a path of chordless cycles. <p> The path decomposition is constructed as in the proof of Theorem 3.1, with e 0 = f1; 18g and e p = f9; 10g. The dashed edges in the graph are the edges that are added for the interval completion. In the same way as in <ref> [BK93] </ref>, we can check whether G is a tree of chordless cycles, and make a list of all chordless cycles in linear time. <p> If the computed value is true for each C i , the answer is yes, otherwise it is no. Step 1 and 2 can be made to run in O (n) time (see Section 3 and <ref> [BK93] </ref>). Step 3 runs in O (n 2 ) time (n = jV (G)j) if procedure COMP PPW2 is used. Hence, we have proved our main result here: Theorem 4.1. There exists an O (n 2 ) time algorithm, that solves ICG for biconnected three-colored graphs.

Reference-contexts: f1;:::; kg Question: Is there a properly colored supergraph G 0 = (V; E 0 ) of G which is an interval graph? This problem models a problem arising in sequence reconstruction, which appears in some investigations in molecular biology (such as protein sequencing, nucleotide sequencing and gene sequencing, see <ref> [FHW93] </ref>). A sequence X (usually a large piece of DNA) is fragmented (or k copies of the sequence X are fragmented) such that the fragments can be further analyzed. The information about the order of the fragments in the original sequence is lost during the fragmentation process. <p> It has been known that ICG for an arbitrary number of colors is NP-complete <ref> [FHW93] </ref>. However, from the application it appears that the cases where the number of colors k (= the number of copies of X that are fragmented) is some small given constant are of interest. In this paper, we resolve the complexity of this problem for all constant values k. <p> Finally, we show that ICG is NP-complete for four colors (and hence, for any fixed number of colors 4.) In <ref> [FHW93] </ref>, Fellows et al. consider ICG with a bounded number of colors. They show that, although for fixed k 3, yes-instances have bounded pathwidth (and hence bounded treewidth), standard methods for graphs with bounded treewidth will be insufficient to solve ICG, as the problem is `not finite state'. <p> Additionally, TCG with three colors is `finite state', while ICG with three colors is not (see <ref> [BFW92, FHW93] </ref>). A generalization of ICG is Intervalizing Sandwich Graphs (ISG). <p> A necessary condition for a three-colored graph G to be `intervalizable' is that the pathwidth of G is at most two, or in other words, that G is a partial two-path <ref> [FHW93] </ref>. Hence, in Section 3, we analyze the structure of biconnected partial two-paths. <p> Lemma 2.2. Let G = (V; E) be a graph, c : V ! f1;:::; kg a k-coloring of G. G has an intervalization if and only if there is a proper path decomposition of G, which has width at most k 1. Proof. (See also <ref> [FHW93] </ref>.) For the `if' part, suppose P D = (V 1 ;:::; V t ) is a proper path decomposition of G. Note that P D has width k 1. Then the interval completion of G for P D is a properly k-colored interval graph. <p> easy way to transform a solution for one problem into a solution for the other problem. 5 For the case that k = 2, the question whether there is a proper path decomposition of G is equal to the question whether G is a properly colored partial one-path (see also <ref> [FHW93] </ref>). <p> Older results showed fixed parameter intractability <ref> [FHW93, BFH94] </ref>, but did not resolve the question. Our NP-completeness result resolves the open problem in a negative way (assuming P 6= NP). Theorem 5.1. ICG is NP-complete for four-colored graphs. 15 Proof. Clearly, ICG 2 NP. To prove NP-hardness, we transform from three-partition, which is strongly NP complete [GJ79].

Reference-contexts: The question is whether there is a graph G = (V; E) such that G is an interval graph, and E 1 E E 2 , i.e. E is `sandwiched' between E 1 and E 2 . This problem is NP-complete <ref> [GKS94] </ref>, which also follows from NP-completeness of ICG. Our NP-completeness result for ICG with four colors also implies NP-completeness for ISG in which the clique size of the interval graph may be at most four.

Reference-contexts: Another closely related problem is Unit-Intervalizing Sandwich Graphs, which asks whether, for a given sandwich graph S = (V; E 1 ; E 2 ), there is a graph G = (V; E) such that G is a unit interval graph and E 1 E E 2 . In <ref> [KS93, KST94] </ref>, it is shown that this problem is NP-complete, polynomial for a fixed maximum clique size of G, hard for W [1], but solvable in O (n k1 ) time if k is the maximum clique size of G. This paper is organized as follows. <p> The O (n k1 ) algorithm of <ref> [KS93, KST94] </ref> for UISG with maximum clique size k can also be used for UICG with k colors. For k = 3, this gives an O (n 2 ) time algorithm.
