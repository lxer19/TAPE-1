Title: Computational Issues in Secure Interoperation  
Author: Li Gong and Xiaolei Qian 
Abstract: Advances in distributed systems and networking technology have made interoperation not only feasible but also increasingly popular. We define the interoperation of secure systems and its security, and prove complexity and composability results on obtaining optimal and secure interoperation. Most problems are NP-complete even for systems with very simple access control structures, while for a general setting the problem is undecidable. Nevertheless, composability reduces complexity in that secure global interoperation can be obtained incrementally by composing secure local interoperation. We illustrate, through an application in secure database interoperation, how these theoretical results can help system designers in practice.

Reference-contexts: First we turn to what we think are the fundamental requirements in secure interoperation. II. Principles of Secure Interoperation One essential feature in federated systems is the autonomy of an individual system that is, each system may be administrated independently [4], <ref> [1] </ref>. To preserve this feature in secure interoperation, autonomy in security should be guaranteed. Principle of Autonomy. Any access permitted within an individual system must also be permit ted under secure interoperation. On the other hand, interoperation should not violate the security of an individual system. Principle of Security. <p> VI. Composability To reduce the complexity of finding maximum secure in-teroperation, one area for exploration is the topology of system interoperation. In some federated systems, for example, interoperation is accomplished by having a master system interacting with other systems in local interopera-tion <ref> [1] </ref>. We now prove that in such a configuration, the global interoperation is secure if and only if each local in-teroperation is secure. <p> Providing secure interoperation not only makes it possible to reliably share data in isolated military and civilian databases, but also increases users' confidence and willingness in such sharing. A key requirement in the interoperation of heterogeneous and especially legacy databases is autonomy <ref> [1] </ref>. Since these databases were often independently designed to each serve the needs of a single organization, and significant investment has already been made into them, the inter-operation must respect their autonomy. Our definition of secure interoperation properly captures the autonomy requirement in security. <p> the most common case in multilevel secure databases, where access control structures form total orders, is polynomial-time solvable, as is shown by Theorem 5. * Although solving the general problem involves examining globally all the interoperating databases and links between them, for the widely adopted case of federated database systems <ref> [1] </ref>, in which all data sharing is carried out through the federated schema, the problem can be solved in a pairwise manner, as is shown by Theorem 7. This implies that the problem can be solved incrementally as new databases join the federation.

Reference-contexts: It is conceivable that under some circumstances a system may be willing to sacrifice some of its autonomy. 2 III. General Undecidability In our discussion, the security attributes of a system are expressed with an access control list (ACL) <ref> [5] </ref>. We view a system as a collection of users, machines, data objects, and others, each being a distinct unit with regard to security.

Reference-contexts: It has been previously shown that the security (or safety, as it is sometimes called in the literature) of any given set of access rights and commands is in general undecidable <ref> [6] </ref>, and some variations of the decision problem are at best NP-complete [7]. Here, we also prove that the general secure interoperation problem is undecidable. Informally, the security aspect of an interoperation is represented by access rights across systems. <p> To satisfy the principle of security, the general problem is to decide if any access that is not permitted in one system is permitted as a result of interoperation. We formulate our problem following the general definitions by Harrison, Ruzzo, and Ullman <ref> [6, Theorem 2, p.469] </ref>. A system in the general HRU model consists of a set of access rights and a set of commands.

Reference-contexts: Our NP-completeness results should imply similar NP-completeness results for formations of the problem using more general access control lists.

In our discussion, we use the following terminology, notations, and definitions.

Reference-contexts: This is similar to a negative entry in an access control list <ref> [11] </ref>. The purpose is to explicitly safeguard certain parts of the system when the potential implications of introduc ing F are unclear. In our example, we may forbid access (Diana, Eve). R takes precedence over F .

Reference-contexts: The rest of the proof is to reduce a known NP-complete problem, the Feedback Arc Set problem <ref> [12, p.192] </ref>, to a restricted case of our problem at hand.

This result implies that, unless P=NP, any polynomial-time algorithm for finding a secure interoperation cannot guarantee to result in a minimum representation. <p> within F that is, we ask if there is a F 0 [ n i=1;j=1;i6=j V i fi V j such that jF 0 j K and that the set of legal access remains unchanged when F is replaced by F 0 then the problem is equivalent to Transitive Reduction <ref> [12, p.198] </ref>, which is solvable in polynomial time. This type of reduction may be useful in a preprocessing step to reduce the problem space of any algorithm used subsequently.

Reference-contexts: As more secure databases are built and connected through computer networks, a wide variety of secure data sources is becoming accessible. One of the biggest challenges presented by this technology is the secure interoperation of databases containing data with mismatched access control structures <ref> [13] </ref>. Providing secure interoperation not only makes it possible to reliably share data in isolated military and civilian databases, but also increases users' confidence and willingness in such sharing. A key requirement in the interoperation of heterogeneous and especially legacy databases is autonomy [1]. <p> Like us, these researchers recognize that naive interoperation may cause security violations. They define a notion called relation consistency and propose a label insertion algorithm to achieve that. But unlike us, they do not provide any complexity or composability result. A canonical security model was proposed for federated databases <ref> [13] </ref>, where the main concern is the integration of heterogeneous security policies and the specification of security constraints in a federated schema. However, the 9 problem of detecting and eliminating security breaches in a federated schema is not considered. IX.

Reference-contexts: VIII. Related Work Secure interoperation can in some sense also be viewed as composing secure systems. A number of composition methods have been proposed for building a large system out of secure components (e.g., <ref> [14] </ref>). These previous results are mostly focused on composing systems with identical or compatible security attributes or policies, and tend to treat the avoidance of covert channels as the most important requirement.

Reference-contexts: We deal with secure interoperation of systems with heterogeneous security attributes, and the composition method we examine is a very natural one that has been used frequently in practice. Another related work is a study of interoperation of multilevel secure databases <ref> [15] </ref>, where the problem is security label translation. Like us, these researchers recognize that naive interoperation may cause security violations. They define a notion called relation consistency and propose a label insertion algorithm to achieve that.

Reference-contexts: For future work, one direction is to improve the theoretical results. This includes obtaining results on the hardness of obtaining percentage-wise approximation solutions, where some recent work <ref> [16] </ref> may be helpful, and investigating other optimality measurements that are applicable to particular environments. We have so far assumed that R represents direct access that are undesirable, such as a negative entry in an access control list.

Reference-contexts: For example, given two permitted access that together will violate security, instead of deciding a priori (and somewhat arbitrarily) to remove one of them, we can decide to keep the one that is used first during run time. This is similar to the Chinese Wall policy (e.g., <ref> [17] </ref>) where one access will automatically prohibit future access of another kind, but which access to prohibit is not decided in advance.
