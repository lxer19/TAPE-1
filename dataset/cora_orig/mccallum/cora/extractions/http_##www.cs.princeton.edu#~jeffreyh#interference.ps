Abstract: We present computer simulations of a model of the brain mechanisms operating in short-term memory tasks that are consistent with the anatomy and physiology of prefrontal cortex and associated subcortical structures. These simulations include dynamical processes in thalamo-cortical loops which are used to generate short-term persistent responses in prefrontal cortex. We discuss this model in terms of the representation of input stimuli in cortical association areas and prefrontal short-term memory areas. We report on interference phenomena that result from the interaction of these dynamical processes and lateral projections within cortical columns. These interference phenomena can be used to elucidate the representational organization of short-term memory.

Reference-contexts: Each functionally specific region extracts from its inputs higher level information regarding a particular aspect of the task. Cortical organization in columns with reciprocal projections between columns has been observed, for example, in the primary and secondary visual areas (Mountcastle, 1978), as well as in the motor cortex <ref> (Asanuma, 1975) </ref>. Modules in the cortical column array in our implementation, shown in Figure 2, correspond to local information processing regions of the cortex, with each module concerned with the representation of a class of feature of an input word.

Reference-contexts: When activated, these loops can sustain activity in frontal cortex neurons (Alexander, Crutcher & DeLong, 1990; Groenewegen & Berendse, 1994; Houk, 1995; Selemon & Goldman-Rakic, 1985). These loops are activated through selective disinhibition by the basal ganglia <ref> (Chevalier & Deniau, 1990) </ref>. In this model the basal ganglia function as a pattern-recognizer providing a contextual set for prefrontal cortex.

Reference-contexts: We show in this paper that short-term memory interference phenomena in human subjects suggest an organization for prefrontal short-term memory circuits. Cohen et al. propose that there is a difference in representation in posterior association cortex and prefrontal STM circuits based upon the difference in their function <ref> (Cohen, Braver & OReilly, 1996) </ref>. They propose a distributed representation in posterior perceptual cortex similar to that described in the previous section and an independent categorical representation in prefrontal STM areas.

Reference-contexts: Similar convergent projections go to each striatal neuron. Also, the lateral inhibitory connections between neurons within each association cortex column are not shown. This design is similar to an architecture proposed by Wallesch and Papagano (Wallesch & Papagno, 1988) as described by Crosson <ref> (Crosson, 1992) </ref>. Based on inputs from the cortical modules and the task representation, the basal ganglia selectively disinhibit the cortico-thalamic loops corresponding to the word features appropriate for the task.

Reference-contexts: Architecture Of Short Term Memory The overall architecture for the postulated prefrontal STM circuits is shown in Fig. 1. The prefrontal and association cortical areas are organized as multiple groups of mutually inhibitory neurons that correspond to cortical columns <ref> (Mountcastle, 1978) </ref>. These columns are indicated by groupings of neurons in the temporal association cortex and prefrontal cortex in the figure. These columns are not necessarily adjacent to each other in each cortical area but may be anatomically distributed. <p> Each functionally specific region extracts from its inputs higher level information regarding a particular aspect of the task. Cortical organization in columns with reciprocal projections between columns has been observed, for example, in the primary and secondary visual areas <ref> (Mountcastle, 1978) </ref>, as well as in the motor cortex (Asanuma, 1975). Modules in the cortical column array in our implementation, shown in Figure 2, correspond to local information processing regions of the cortex, with each module concerned with the representation of a class of feature of an input word.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, for a STM task with visual stimuli, this would correspond to a projection from inferior temporal cortex to prefrontal cortex <ref> (Ungerleider, Gaffan & Pelak, 1989) </ref>. In addition to receiving projections from the sensory/language cortical modules, the frontal cortex also has highly specific reciprocal projections with the thalamus, resulting in local cortico-thalamic loops.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we simulate a representational scheme in STM, which is similar to theirs, and show that it is consistent with proactive inhibition (PI) and release from proactive inhibition phenomena. PI is a well known phenomena in which short-term memory recall is decreased due to previous related items <ref> (Wickins, 1970) </ref>. In the case of words, this effect is maximum within taxonomic categories, and within the classes of stimuli such as words and numbers.
