Abstract: For integer k 0, let srm(n O(1) ; k) denote the collection of relations computable by a stack register machine with stack registers bounded by a polynomial p(n) in the input n, and work registers bounded by k. Let nsrm(n O(1) ; k) denote the analogous class accepted by nondeterministic stack register machines. In this paper, nondeterminism is shown to provide no additional power. Specifically,

Reference-contexts: Around the same time, a few other logicians began investigating other problems in what was later defined to be the field of computational complexity. In 1955, Asser <ref> [1] </ref> asked whether the complement of a spectrum is a spectrum (by work of Jones-Selman [24] equivalent to N EXP = co N EXP ) and in 1956, Grzegorczyk [16] defined a hierarchy E n , n 0, within the primitive recursive functions, and asked whether E 0 fl is properly <p> Sets A N n definable by first order formulas in the signature f0; +; =g <ref> [resp. f0; 1; fi; =g] </ref> are known as Presburger [resp.

Reference-contexts: This key observation was used by D. Barrington <ref> [3] </ref> in his proof that (uniform) bounded width polynomial size branching programs compute exactly the functions in alogtime. 26 Theorem 44 Let G be any finite, unsolvable group. Then alintime = Glth = N GLT H. <p> We fix a look-up table which for each g 2 G, associates a sequence ha i b i a 1 i b 1 commutators whose product is g. Using Barrington's argument <ref> [3] </ref>, given an element g 2 G and a tree T (x) arising from a computation of M on x, we describe a word w T (x) in the elements of G such that w T (x) = e if M accepts x g else. <p> A language is said to be logspace serializable if the computations between bottlenecks are performed in logspace. Using the technique of Barrington <ref> [3] </ref>, Cai and Furst [6] prove that pspace is logspace serializable by a 5 state safe-storage machine, and hence that F P 5 = pspace . The characterization of pspace from [6] is related to the fourth line of Theorem 54.

Reference-contexts: Ritchie [31] showed that E 2 fl equals deterministic linear space. 2 It follows from work of Bennett [5] and Wrathall [37] that the linear time hierarchy lth is contained in E 0 fl . Thus E 0 fl ae E 2 implies that lth ae linspace. In <ref> [4] </ref>, A. Bel'tyukov introduced the stack register machine srm, a new variant of the successor random access machine having stack registers t 0 ; : : : ; t k and work register r. <p> AC 0 (2), AC 0 (6), T C 0 [12]. 3 i.e. numbers whose length is linear in the length of the input. 4 E 0 (f ) is the smallest class of functions containing 0, f , the successor, the projections and closed under composition and bounded recursion (see <ref> [4] </ref>). Bel'tyukov's result should be contrasted with the easily shown fact that E 0 fl (2x) = E 1 2 ph and pspace can be characterized. <p> Perhaps our forthcoming characterizations of these classes in terms of stack register machines may facilitate an approach to these problems. 2 Preliminaries In <ref> [4] </ref>, Bel'tyukov introduced stack register machines and characterized the class rud of rudimentary sets as well as all levels (E n ) fl of the Grzegorczyk hierarchy via stack register machines. <p> statement is an abbreviation for "if t 0 = t 0 then i else i". 1. if t 0 = x 2 then 2 else 3 2. if t 0 = x 1 then 7 else 6 3. if t 0 = x 1 then 7 else 4 7 In <ref> [4, 28] </ref> and other previous work, F was taken to be the set of multivariate polynomials with non-negative integer coefficients, i.e. built up by composition from constants n 2 N, the projection functions i n k (x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) = x k , addition <p> If F is a class of functions, then F fl denotes the class of relations whose characteristic function belongs to F. With this notation, Bel'tyukov proves the following. 9 Theorem 14 (Bel'tyukov <ref> [4] </ref>) (i) Ef = srm (f (O (1)) ; f (O (1)) ) 2 1 fl implies E 2 0 (iii) For s 1, E 0 (iv) srm (n O (1) ; 0) = N To situate Bel'tyukov's work, note that it is well-known that if lth = linspace then E <p> Modulo well-known results of C. Wrathall [37] and J. Bennett [5] equating N 0 and lth, and of R.W. Ritchie [31] equating E 2 fl with linspace, we mention the following result. Theorem 15 (Bel'tyukov <ref> [4] </ref>) srm (n O (1) ; 0) = lth srm (n O (1) ; n O (1) ) = linspace : In [27], J. Paris and A. <p> In <ref> [4] </ref> Bel'tyukov actually proves in (iv) of Theorem 14 that srm (n O (1) ; 0) = rud, where rud is the class of rudimentary predicates. In [5], J.

Reference-contexts: Though Grzegorczyk's E 0 fl ae E 2 fl question is still open, several significant results have shed light on the problem. In 1961, R. Ritchie [31] showed that E 2 fl equals deterministic linear space. 2 It follows from work of Bennett <ref> [5] </ref> and Wrathall [37] that the linear time hierarchy lth is contained in E 0 fl . Thus E 0 fl ae E 2 implies that lth ae linspace. In [4], A. <p> Modulo well-known results of C. Wrathall [37] and J. Bennett <ref> [5] </ref> equating N 0 and lth, and of R.W.

In <ref> [5] </ref>, J. Bennett proves that rud = N 0 . <p> By hypothesis on R, given u &lt; x and y max in G, it can be verified in alintime whether :R (u; y max ) holds. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Bennett <ref> [5] </ref> has shown that the graph of exponentiation (i.e. the ternary relation a b = c) belongs to lth. <p> The characterization of pspace from [6] is related to the fourth line of Theorem 54. By techniques of Bennett <ref> [5] </ref>, it follows that the computation of a polynomial time bounded Turing machine can be arithmetized by a bounded formula in the signature f0; 1; +; fi; #; g and hence by a stack register machine with a fixed number of stack registers, no work register, with F = f+; fi;

Reference-contexts: For k 4, it similarly follows that nsrm [+; fi; #](2 jnj O (1) ; k) = aptime, where the latter denotes the class of alternating polynomial time computable functions. By the well-known theorem of Savitch, alternating polynomial time equals polynomial space which equals nondeterministic polynomial space. 38 In <ref> [6] </ref> Cai and Furst introduce the k-state safe-storage Turing machine M which has a read-only input tape, a read/write work tape, a polynomially long binary counter tape or clock, and a safe-storage device capable of remembering k states. <p> A language is said to be logspace serializable if the computations between bottlenecks are performed in logspace.

Reference-contexts: Paris and A. Wilkie studied stack register machines whose work registers contain no number larger than k, for k = 1; 2; 3. In <ref> [28] </ref>, W. Handley, J. Paris and A. Wilkie related the concept of counting modulo a finite group with srm. These results are summarized later. In this paper, we extend the stack register machine model in two directions: nondeterminism is introduced, and different branching test instructions are added. <p> Of particular relevance for this paper are his characterizations of the linear time hierarchy lth and linear space, as well as similar type characterizations of extensions of lth under counting due to Paris Handley-Wilkie <ref> [28] </ref>. In this paper, we generalize stack register machines to arbitrary test conditions in branching instructions. Definition 1 Let F be a set of functions. <p> statement is an abbreviation for "if t 0 = t 0 then i else i". 1. if t 0 = x 2 then 2 else 3 2. if t 0 = x 1 then 7 else 6 3. if t 0 = x 1 then 7 else 4 7 In <ref> [4, 28] </ref> and other previous work, F was taken to be the set of multivariate polynomials with non-negative integer coefficients, i.e. built up by composition from constants n 2 N, the projection functions i n k (x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) = x k , addition <p> GP H (;) is denoted by GP H. 8 The proof that LT H = N 0 readily yields that LT H A = N;A 0 and hence that GLT H = G N 0 , the latter studied in <ref> [28] </ref>. Let I be the collection of all projection functions i n k (x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) = x k , for all n and 1 k n. <p> It is important to mention that our work left open the case for work register bounds of 2 and 3. Using different techniques, W.G. Handley later solved this problem in [17]. 10 Warning. In the notation of <ref> [28] </ref>, Theorem 17 is stated as Space (k) = S k N 0 , where the authors there define Space (k) to be the set of languages computed by a stack register machine with polynomial bounds on stack registers, and where numbers in the work register are strictly less than k <p> The formula fi fl k+1 is defined using bounded quantifiers and (deterministic) counting modulo 2. It follows that nsrm (n O (1) ; 1) Z 2 lth . It is straightforward to see that Z 2 lth is contained in srm (n O (1) ; 1) (see <ref> [28] </ref> for a sketch of a proof). This concludes the proof of part (b). Remark 46 It is not obvious how to lift this technique to prove that srm (n O (1) ; k) = nsrm (n O (1) ; k) for k = 2; 3. <p> Here fi fl k+1 is not definable using counting mod ulo 2, but does belong to nM k+1 lth. Proposition 48 (Paris, Handley, Wilkie <ref> [28] </ref>) For all integers k 0, srm (n O (1) ; k) = M k+1 lth : Proof Theorem 7 of [28] (p. 358) states that srm (n O (1) ; k) = S k+1 lth , where S k+1 is the full symmetric group on k + 1 letters. <p> Here fi fl k+1 is not definable using counting mod ulo 2, but does belong to nM k+1 lth. Proposition 48 (Paris, Handley, Wilkie <ref> [28] </ref>) For all integers k 0, srm (n O (1) ; k) = M k+1 lth : Proof Theorem 7 of [28] (p. 358) states that srm (n O (1) ; k) = S k+1 lth , where S k+1 is the full symmetric group on k + 1 letters. At the top of p. 359 of [28], it is shown by induction that (8n)(8m n)[M n lth S m lth ]. <p> (n O (1) ; k) = M k+1 lth : Proof Theorem 7 of <ref> [28] </ref> (p. 358) states that srm (n O (1) ; k) = S k+1 lth , where S k+1 is the full symmetric group on k + 1 letters. At the top of p. 359 of [28], it is shown by induction that (8n)(8m n)[M n lth S m lth ]. Thus srm (n O (1) ; k) = M k+1 lth . Alternatively, the proposition can be directly proved using the approach in the proof of Proposition 47.
