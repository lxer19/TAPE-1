Abstract: In this paper, we derive tracking control laws for nonminimum phase nonlinear systems with both fast and slow, possibly unstable, zero dynamics. The fast zero dynamics arise from a perturbation of a nominal system. These fast zeros can be problematic in that they may be in the right half plane and may cause large magnitude tracking control inputs. In this paper, we combine the ideas from some recent work of Hunt, Meyer, and Su with that of Devasia, Chen, and Paden on an asymptotic tracking procedure for nonminimum phase nonlinear systems. We give (somewhat subtle) conditions under which the tracking control input is bounded as the magnitude of the perturbation of the nominal system becomes zero. Explicit bounds on the control inputs are calculated for both SISO and MIMO systems using some interesting non-standard singular perturbation techniques. The method is applied to a suite of examples, including the simplified planar dynamics of VTOL and CTOL aircraft. fl Research supported in part by NASA under grant NAG2-243, ARO under grant DAAH04-95-0588.

Reference-contexts: For systems such as this, the presence of the small control terms not only meant large control effort, but was symptomatic of "fast zero dynamics" which were possibly nonminimum phase. We explained this phenomenon in <ref> [ Sastry et al., 1989 ] </ref> , [ Isidori et al., 1992 ] and [ Godbole and Sastry, 1995 ] as a singular perturbation of the zero dynamics and discussed approximate methods for controlling the zero dynamics. <p> assume that x = x 0 is an equilibrium point for the nominal system, that is f (x 0 ; 0) = 0, and without loss of generality we will assume that h (x 0 ; 0) = 0. 2.1 Singularly Perturbed Zero and Driven Dynamics In the two papers <ref> [ Sastry et al., 1989 ] </ref> and [ Isidori et al., 1992 ] , it was shown that if the system (1) has relative degree r (*) = r for * 6= 0, and relative degree r (*) = r + d for * = 0, then there are fast time <p> It was shown in <ref> [ Sastry et al., 1989 ] </ref> , [ Isidori et al., 1992 ] that for small * we have the following "normal form" (in the sense of [ Isidori, 1989 ] ): _ ~ 1 = ~ 2 . . . _ ~ r+1 = ~ r+2 + * d1 ff <p> ~ r+1 = ~ r+2 + * d1 ff 1 (~; ; *)u . . . _ = q (~; ; *) Here, we have introduced the smooth functions a, b, and q; the details of how a and b depend on f , g, and h are discussed in <ref> [ Sastry et al., 1989 ] </ref> , [ Isidori et al., 1992 ] . 2 This is an interesting case and though it is no different conceptually, the notation and the details of the assumptions needed are more involved. 5 Using the change of coordinates for the perturbed system given by

Reference-contexts: Early progress was made by the nonlinear regulator approach of Isidori-Byrnes [ Isidori and Byrnes, 1990 ] which extended to the nonlinear case results of the Francis-Wonham regulator. Some drawbacks of this approach were the assumption of an exo-system and small domains of attraction <ref> [ Teel, 1991 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: Related work is presented in [ Azam and Singh, 1994 ] and [ Benvenuti et al., 1993 ] . In new work on the problem of stable tracking for MIMO systems with fast zero dynamics, we attempted in <ref> [ Tomlin et al., 1995 ] </ref> to apply the Devasia-Chen-Paden technique to a model of a Conventional Take Off and Landing (CTOL) aircraft and to make comparisons with the other approximate techniques discussed above. <p> Our examples are motivated by our study of flight control for vertical take off and landing (VTOL) and conventional take off and landing (CTOL) aircraft, in [ Hauser et al., 1992b ] and <ref> [ Tomlin et al., 1995 ] </ref> . These are two-input two-output systems in which the nominal systems have no zero dynamics. 24 Hauser) PVTOL Aircraft We consider a model of a planar vertical takeoff and landing (PVTOL) aircraft, an example being the YAV-8B Harrier of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation. <p> Then if * is small enough the unique bounded solution of (85) is of O (* 2 ). CTOL Aircraft The second aircraft model we consider is the planar conventional take off and landing (PC-TOL) aircraft introduced in <ref> [ Tomlin et al., 1995 ] </ref> . The simplified PCTOL equations are _x 1 = x 2 _x 3 = x 4 (86) _x 5 = x 6 where x 1 = x, x 3 = y, x 5 = .

Reference-contexts: Finally, the system is stabilized about the exact tracking input and trajectory using a linear time varying feedback law (about the linearization, see for example, [ Cheng, 1979 ] , <ref> [ Walsh et al., 1994 ] </ref> ). 4 Examples We illustrate the theory of the previous section with a comprehensive set of linear and nonlinear examples, for both single-input single-output and multi-input multi-output systems. 19 4.1 Textbook Linear Examples 4.1.1 Single-Input Single-Output Linear Systems SISO Example 1 The first example we

Reference-contexts: Periodic Inputs It is of interest to investigate the steady state solution of (97) given by (101) in the special case that u (:) is periodic with period T . In the instance that A is hyperbolic, it follows from a basic perturbation theorem ( <ref> [ Wiggins, 1990 ] </ref> , page 111) that for ju (:)j 1 small enough, there is a unique periodic steady state solution of (97) which inherits the stability properties of A.
