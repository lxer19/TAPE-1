Reference-contexts: Providing FANSYS with both types of reasoning will require the development of new memory structures which accommodate these and the reasoning approaches previously discussed. 9.7 Subjective Comprehension of Input Text and Questions Comprehension of input text and questions in FANSYS must also be influenced by the ideological perspective <ref> (Carbonell, 1981) </ref> that FANSYS may have about diagnosis and repair procedures in a given domain. That is, FANSYS must attempt to understand descriptions of failure analysis and relate their conceptual content to its own beliefs and justifications involving related and/or similar failures.

Reference-contexts: Marker passing may be defined as the propagation of structured objects over some representational network. The intersection of markers during this propagation typically allows useful work to be performed. (See <ref> (Hendler, 1988) </ref> and (Norvig, 1989) for an introduction to marker passing methods in general.) In FANSYS, two types of markers are propagated: prediction markers and activation markers. Prediction markers are passed to nodes in memory which are predicted by advancing index patterns.

These techniques allow for an entirely new level of analysis. In model-based reasoning, the system creates its own model prototype based on the input data.

Reference-contexts: Our solution to this problem in FANSYS is to overlay an additional indexing structure on top of the ISA memory hierarchy. This additional indexing structure is based upon the memory representation model used in Kolodner's CYRUS system <ref> (Kolodner, 1983a, 1983b, 1984) </ref>. Collectively, these indices form a rich hierarchy of generalizations where many indices point to each case. Since this memory representation allows for indexing and the creation of generalizations, this hierarchy will be referred to as the Generalization-Indexing (GI) memory hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: To deal with this knowledge engineering bottleneck, FANSYS must be able to dynamically acquire and augment its knowledge during text comprehension.

Reference-contexts: While the user interface employed in FANSYS is currently in the preliminary stages of development, it does address a number of design issues. First, FANSYS utilizes the X window system through the GARNET UIMS developed at Carnegie Mellon University <ref> (Myers, 1991) </ref>. This allows for integration with other unix-based applications and provides a foundation for future development. Second, an emphasis has been made to simplify the question/answering sessions since this is anticipated to be the most frequently used aspect of the system.

Reference-contexts: Marker passing may be defined as the propagation of structured objects over some representational network. The intersection of markers during this propagation typically allows useful work to be performed. (See (Hendler, 1988) and <ref> (Norvig, 1989) </ref> for an introduction to marker passing methods in general.) In FANSYS, two types of markers are propagated: prediction markers and activation markers. Prediction markers are passed to nodes in memory which are predicted by advancing index patterns.

Reference-contexts: To model this reminding process, FANSYS must organize and maintain failure-analysis memories by using a hierarchical organization scheme of the type used the OCCAM system <ref> (Pazzani, 1988) </ref> in addition to the GI hierarchy. FANSYS must also be able to handle input text that is not directly dependent on the knowledge constructs and lexical entries initially encoded in the system.

Reference-contexts: The research described in this technical report is aimed at extending the theories of natural language processing and memory search and retrieval underlying OpEds design. In particular, this research has been concerned with the development of a model of text comprehension and question answering that uses case-based reasoning techniques <ref> (Riesbeck and Schank, 1989) </ref> to acquire knowledge of failure analysis from input text, and answer questions regarding diagnosis and repair of failures in complex systems, such as NASAs Space Station Freedom. <p> These features have been implemented in the FANSYS parser using a marker passing algorithm suggested (but not implemented) in microversion of DMAP appearing in <ref> (Riesbeck and Schank, 1989) </ref>. Marker passing may be defined as the propagation of structured objects over some representational network. <p> This pointer is used to inform the predicting node of the fact that the prediction was fulfilled. parent Prediction Marker Structure The basic marker passing algorithm which implements the prediction/activation mechanism is an adaptation of the one presented in <ref> (Riesbeck and Schank, 1989) </ref>. It consists of the following four rules for passing markers: Activation Markers When a word is read from the input text, an activation marker is given to the corresponding lexical node. <p> To deal with this knowledge engineering bottleneck, FANSYS must be able to dynamically acquire and augment its knowledge during text comprehension. Consequently, the model of text comprehension and question answering implemented in FANSYS will include explanation-based and case-based strategies, such as those described in (Kolodner, 1988) and <ref> (Schank and Riesbeck, 1989) </ref>, for dynamically acquiring and encoding knowledge constructs associated with a given domain or a given natural language. 9.6 Model and Functional Based Reasoning Another extension which would increase the power of FANSYS is the addition of model-based and functional-based reasoning (Hodges, 1989).

Reference-contexts: Domain Knowledge Representation One of the first tasks confronting a researcher in constructing a natural language understanding system is to characterize the domain in which the understanding system is to operate <ref> (Schank, 1975, 1978) </ref>. Once this domain has been characterized, a representational scheme must be adopted that will allow the researcher to encode that domain knowledge in a manner that permits the system to perform the required understanding task (Alvarado, 1990; Carbonell, 1981; Schank and Carbonell, 1979; Wilensky, 1986).

Reference-contexts: This domain model must be dynamically built as a result of 127 remindings <ref> (Schank, 1982) </ref> that occur when similar textual inputs are processed. FANSYS should also account for how cross-contextual remindings occur when reading input descriptions of failure analysis in different flight systems, and how memory search and retrieval processes must be able to adapt to memory changes that result from these remindings.
