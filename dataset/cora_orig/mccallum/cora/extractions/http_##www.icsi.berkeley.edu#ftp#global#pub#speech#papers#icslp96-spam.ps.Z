Abstract: In [6], we develop statistical model of speech recognition where emphasis is placed on the perceptually-relevant and information-rich portion of the speech signal. In that model, speech is viewed as a sequence of elementary decisions or Auditory Events (avents) that are made in response to loci of significant spectral change. These decision points are interleaved with periods during which insufficient information has been accumulated to make the next decision. We have called this a Stochastic Perceptual Avent Model, or SPAM. In the work reported here, we have extended our initial experimental implementation [7] to include other probabilistic dependencies specified in the original theory, particularly the dependence on the time from the current frame back to the previous hypothesized avent.

Reference-contexts: For another approach to handling such a mismatch, see <ref> [1] </ref>. Our new HMM-like model uses the durational dependent probability vectors produced by the ANN. It incorporates three groups of non-transitional states and three avent states, each corresponding to a different durational dependence. <p> The number of quantized durations should be varied to experiment with resolution/complexity tradeoffs. The number of non-transitional states should also be varied | a single state type might represent too large and too diverse a feature space. Soft targets <ref> [1] </ref> would relax avent region boundaries | rather than one speech frame per avent, which our current system uses, an avent should be able to occur at any of several multiple frames and have decreasing likelihood at the edges (see [1] for an approach to determine such a probabilistic target). <p> Soft targets <ref> [1] </ref> would relax avent region boundaries | rather than one speech frame per avent, which our current system uses, an avent should be able to occur at any of several multiple frames and have decreasing likelihood at the edges (see [1] for an approach to determine such a probabilistic target). Negative training examples, in which the recognition phase uses input space regions within the training set, might also help performance.

Reference-contexts: In [7, 8], we reported on the initial SPAM implementation using a telephone quality database of digits and control words from Bellcore that we call "digits+". Only 46 diphones and therefore avents (including the non-transitional state) actually occur in this database. Using a hybrid HMM/ANN approach <ref> [2] </ref>, probabilities for an HMM-like decoding are estimated by training ANNs with acoustic feature vectors and target labels.

Reference-contexts: This allows the segment to correspond to successive outputs of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) state. In such systems, modeling power is usually focused on matching each locally stationary segment with a particular HMM state. Regions of spectral transition, as noted by many researchers, notably Furui <ref> [3] </ref>, can be important for phonetic discrimination. Decision points made in response to such acoustic evidence might be more invariant under different speaking styles and acoustics, and therefore we would like to build a structure for focusing modeling power on these decisions.

Reference-contexts: The stationary segments within a speech signal are spectrally quite diverse, but pre-processing approaches such as delta computation or RASTA <ref> [4] </ref> will significantly reduce this diversity. Because we aim to focus modeling power on the decisions corresponding to phonetic transitions, we wish to suppress the detailed disparities between different non-transition segments. Therefore, we use one broad category, called a non-transitional state, to represent speech frames falling within these segments.

Reference-contexts: SPAM might be ideally suited to domains with considerable speech rate variation. During very fast and very slow speech, more stationary regions (e.g., vowel nuclei) might be significantly compressed or expanded relative to median-rate speech <ref> [5] </ref>. Transitional regions (e.g., bursts), however, undergo relatively little transformation. The SPAM model, which if required can completely ignore or indefinitely extend states associated with the more stationary regions, might be well suited handling to such rate variations. We wish to thank Steve Greenberg and Hynek Hermansky for useful discussions.

Reference-contexts: Decision points made in response to such acoustic evidence might be more invariant under different speaking styles and acoustics, and therefore we would like to build a structure for focusing modeling power on these decisions. We would also like to avoid the i.i.d. assumptions described above. In <ref> [6] </ref>, we introduced such a structure. Perceptual decisions made in response to significant spectral changes are called Auditory Events, or avents. <p> These numbers are recalled in Section 4, along with newer results. 3. SPAM MODEL WITH DURATIONAL DEPENDENCE The original SPAM theory <ref> [6] </ref> suggested that Equation 1 could be simplified in various ways. In particular, if we assume that the probability of an avent is independent of the previous avent, Equation 1 simplifies to: P (q ` nd ): Our second SPAM implementation therefore extends the basic SPAM model with durational dependence. <p> SPAM MODEL WITH DURATIONAL AND PREVIOUS AVENT DEPENDENCE We are currently beginning to evaluate a SPAM implementation that uses local probabilities with all of the dependencies described in the original theory <ref> [6] </ref> and given in Equation 1. Because of the limited size of the digits+ database, avents are clustered into broad classes rather than used themselves. Two avent classification methods based either on phonemic or phonetic-like information are being evaluated.

Reference-contexts: The training stage of a Stochastic Perceptual Avent Model (SPAM) based recognition system is designed to focus modeling power on the identification of the transition decisions. Therefore, similar to certain segment-based models, a SPAM system is less handicapped by assumptions of intra-phonetic independence. In <ref> [7] </ref>, we reported on a simplified SPAM implementation. In the work reported here, we have extended that system to include the time and avent dependencies specified in the original theory. In Section 2, we review the essentials of our earlier SPAM experiments. <p> In Section 4, we evaluate the word-error performance on an isolated digits database. In Section 5, we describe a SPAM implementation that includes both the durational and previous avent dependence. And finally, in Section 6, we describe possible future work. 2. SPAM CLASSIC As discussed in <ref> [7] </ref>, under the SPAM recognition model, speech is considered a sequence of avent points interleaved with non-decision regions that typically correspond to acoustic segments containing less spectral change. <p> In <ref> [7, 8] </ref>, we reported on the initial SPAM implementation using a telephone quality database of digits and control words from Bellcore that we call "digits+". Only 46 diphones and therefore avents (including the non-transitional state) actually occur in this database. <p> Only 46 diphones and therefore avents (including the non-transitional state) actually occur in this database. Using a hybrid HMM/ANN approach [2], probabilities for an HMM-like decoding are estimated by training ANNs with acoustic feature vectors and target labels. As discussed in <ref> [7, 8] </ref>, two networks are separately trained based on the factorization given in Equa tion 2, one for classifying avent states and one to distinguish between avents and non-avents (i.e., non-transitional states). <p> A short (resp. medium) duration corresponds to anything below 4 (resp. 7) speech frames. Greater than 7 non-transitional frames is possible, as indicated by the self loop, but greater lengths become decreasingly likely. 4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION through 3 show error rates for the experiments described in <ref> [7] </ref>. Row 1 corresponds to a SPAM recognizer incorporating two 100 hidden-unit (HU) networks as described in Section 2, row 2 to a single 200 HU phone-based recognizer, and row 3 to a system that combines the scaled word-likelihoods of the two preceding systems. <p> Rows 4 and 5 show the new error rates. As in <ref> [7] </ref>, all new results are trained and tested using the digits+ database. We tested each system using data from 200 speakers totaling 2600 examples from 4 jackknifed cuts.

We have been attempting to equalize the number of avents in each class to reduce the chance of inappropriately learning the relative class size distribution. Recall that in the current SPAM methodology <ref> [8] </ref>, avents correspond to left-context-dependent onsets. Our first classification method therefore uses phonetic attributes of the constituent phonemes, namely, the continuant/non-continuant property. This attribute should, in theory, separate phonemes into groups with significantly different spectral characteristics.
