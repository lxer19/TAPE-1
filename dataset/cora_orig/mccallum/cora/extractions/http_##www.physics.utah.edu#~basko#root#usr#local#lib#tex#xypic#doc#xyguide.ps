Abstract: X Y -pic is a package for typesetting graphs and diagrams using plain T E X, L A T E X, A M S-L A T E X, and A M S-T E X. Several modes of input are supported; this guide concentrates on how to typeset `matrix-like' diagrams like independently of the matrix structure. Remark: X Y -pic release 2.12. @? is also a fi-release of X Y -pic version 3, referred to here as v3 . This is greatly enhanced and extended relative to version 2. Many features described in this document are therefore obsolete but remain valid (as a special `compatibility' mode). We remark it at the end of a section whenever this is the case; look in the X Y -pic Reference Manual [3] commutative diagrams in the following style:

Reference-contexts: Introduction This guide explains some features of X Y -pic version 2 that are related to diagram typesetting newer fea tures are described in the reference manual <ref> [3] </ref> (some 1 are mentioned in italicised comments). It assumes that you have some experience in using T E X for typesetting mathematics, e.g., have studied [1, ch. 16-19], [2, sec. 3.3], or [4]. The first section describes what you need to get started. <p> Other modes are available; see the Reference Manual <ref> [3] </ref> for details. * entries are typeset as mathematics (in `text style'), * all entries are centered, * the separation between rows and columns is usu ally quite large in a diagram, * entries at the end of rows that are empty may be omitted, and most importantly: * "X Y <p> The full range of possibilities is described in the reference manual <ref> [3] </ref>; here is a number of useful possibilities: * [r,c] , where r; c are integers, denotes the relative entry found r rows below and c columns to the right of the current entry (the current entry itself is thus [0,0]). <p> The possible directions are named like hops: dl dr ur ul and the possible targets include all those discussed above and in the reference manual <ref> [3] </ref>. Actually the direction letter is only required for the first in a series of turns since the final direction of one turn is the default for the following turn. <p> The bending arrows in section 1.6 are special cases of the above construction. There are several more advanced possibilities described in <ref> [3] </ref>, notably the possi bility for non-quarter turns. <p> The following uses this for a new arrow type mapsto: "definemorphism-mapsto-"solid"tip"stop "diagram A "rmapsto^f & A"times A "dlmapsto_g "" B "umapsto 6 "enddiagram typesets You should only use "definemorphism if you need it, though, since it defines many control sequences. The reference manual <ref> [3] </ref> describes how to define your own groups of bent arrows and how to make double and triple tips. It also describes a much more general way of defining new arrows. <p> "rto^&gt;(.5)-"text-start-- & "squarify&lt;1em&gt;-0- "circled "toru^b "rto_a & "squarify&lt;1em&gt;-1- "circled "rto^b "tord_a & "squarify&lt;1em&gt;-2- "circled "rto^b "xto `r+D `[l] _a `[l] [l] & "squarify&lt;1em&gt;-3- "Circled "xto `r+U `[lll]^b `[lll] [lll] "enddiagram will typeset start 0 a 1 a b 3 a Many more frames types are described in the reference manual <ref> [3] </ref>.

Fix : Use the : and :: operators (described in detail in the reference manual <ref> [3] </ref>). * Using t 1 ;t 2 :(x,y) as the target of an arrow command does not work. Fix : Enclose it in braces, i.e., write -t 1 ;t 2 :(x,y)-. * The older "pit, "apit, and "bpit commands are not defined.
