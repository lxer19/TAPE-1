Abstract: With recent advances in wireless communication and the ubiquity of laptops, mobile computing has become an important research area. An essential problem in mobile computing is the delivery of a message from a source (stationary or mobile) to a desired mobile unit. Standard solutions used in Mobile IP and cellular phones rely on tracking the mobile unit. Tracking solutions scale badly when mobile units move frequently. Our paper proposes a new message delivery algorithm and includes a proof outline using the UNITY logic. Our algorithm requires no tracking and provides stronger guarantees than existing protocols.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm extends trivially to multi-cast solely by changing the destination address to that of a multicast group. The algorithm operates correctly even in the presence of rapid movement and provides a more distributed approach than other reliable multi-cast protocols <ref> [1] </ref>. Future work involves extending this work to non-FIFO channels and developing other algorithms for reliable announcement delivery in a mobile setting that do not require that messages be stored for an extended period of time.

Reference-contexts: As this new world of computing is taking form, many fundamental assumptions about the structure and the behavior of computer networks are being challenged and redefined <ref> [2] </ref>. Mobile computing is emerging as a novel paradigm with its own characteristic problems, models, and algorithms. The typical model of distributed computing treats a network as a graph in which vertices represent processing nodes and edges denote communication channels.

Reference-contexts: This process is similar to running a distributed snapshot algorithm <ref> [3] </ref> to determine the location of the messages in the system. A naive scheme can pass the announcement from one node to another, with the announcement copies forming a wave that moves across the graph.

Reference-contexts: The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we outline the problem of announcement delivery in a mobile setting, present two approaches and their challenges. Section 3 introduces our approach to announcement delivery and specifies the solution as a UNITY <ref> [4] </ref> program. Section 4 outlines the proof of correctness for our delivery algorithm. Section 5 consists of some brief concluding remarks. 2 Announcement Delivery Problem Statement The problem we are interested in is the delivery of announcements among pairs of mobile units. <p> This provides further intuition concerning moving into the cleared region. We capture the essence of our solution in the form of a UNITY program shown in Figure 2. UNITY <ref> [4] </ref> provides a state transition model for concurrent programming in which progress and safety properties can be cleanly defined and proven from the program text. We utilize the UNITY proof logic in the next section where we formally verify the correctness of the algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Minimizing storage requirements across the network is another concern. Standard solutions to announcement delivery (e.g., cellular phones <ref> [5] </ref> and Mobile IP [9, 10]) rely on tracking a mobile unit as it moves around a fixed wired network.

Reference-contexts: Wireless technology and the decreasing size of computer components allow users to travel from office to home and around the country with the computer at their side. Both location-transparent and context-dependent services are desired. Decoupled computing is becoming the norm <ref> [6] </ref>. Disconnection is no longer a network fault but a common event intentionally caused by the user in order to conserve power or a consequence of movement.

Reference-contexts: Connection and disconnection is controlled by the distance among nodes and by their willingness to collaborate in the formation of a cohesive, albeit transitory community. Mechanisms are being developed to maintain routing of messages by grouping nodes into localized regions <ref> [7] </ref>. The density of nodes may provide an additional discriminating feature of these kinds of networks. Formal models for reasoning about mobile computations are also under development, e.g., Mobile UNITY [8]. In this paper, we investigate an algorithm for message delivery among mobile nodes.

This is possible because the MSC based mobile system is similar to the cellular telephone system.
