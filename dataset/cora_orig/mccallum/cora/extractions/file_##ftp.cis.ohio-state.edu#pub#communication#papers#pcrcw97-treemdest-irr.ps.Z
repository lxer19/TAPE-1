Abstract: Multidestination message passing has been proposed as a mechanism to achieve efficient multicast in regular direct and indirect networks. The application of this technique to parallel systems based on irregular networks has, however, not been studied. In this paper we propose two schemes for performing multicast using multidestination worms on irregular networks and examine the extent to which multidestination message passing can improve multicast performance. For each of the schemes we propose solutions for the associated problems such as, methods for encoding and decoding multidestination headers, alterations to the setup algorithm run by the switches, logic to perform header manipulation, etc. We perform extensive simulations to evaluate our schemes under a variety of changing parameters: software startup overhead per message, system size, switch size, message length, and degree of connectivity. Our results establish that even a very naive multicasting algorithm using multidestination message passing can result in considerable perfor mance gains over the best unicast based multicasting schemes.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Parallel computing on networks of workstations is fast emerging as a cost-effective alternative to MPPs. These systems are typically interconnected by switches in an irregular topology <ref> [1, 11] </ref>. Because of this, many of the problems that have been solved for regular topologies have to be solved anew for these systems. To perform communication with low latency these systems typically use cut-through switching (routing) due to inherent advantages such as low latency. <p> The number of ports that are left unconnected is varied to obtain networks with different degrees of connectivity. 2.2 Unicast Routing in Irregular Networks Recently, a number of approaches have been proposed for routing packets in irregular networks <ref> [1, 9, 10, 11] </ref>. An important issue in networks with cut-through routing is the avoidance of deadlock due to cyclic waiting among packets. <p> An important issue in networks with cut-through routing is the avoidance of deadlock due to cyclic waiting among packets. Each of the proposed routing solutions tries to address this deadlock problem either by eliminating the possibility of cyclic wait <ref> [1, 9, 10] </ref> or by allowing cycles but by providing paths for messages to escape from cyclic wait scenarios [11]. For the purposes of this paper however, we will adopt the approach outlined in [10]. This approach, called up*/down* routing, is described next.

An efficient, single phase multicasting scheme using a multidestination worm with a bit-string encoded header was proposed in [8, 14]. Key to the efficient implementation of this multicast is the presence of reachability strings at each of the network switches.

Reference-contexts: Such a multicast requires at least log 2 d (d+1)e phases to cover d destinations. Such unicast based multicasting schemes have been recently proposed for irregular networks <ref> [4] </ref>. Multidestination routing has been proposed for parallel systems based on regular networks. Originally proposed for direct (router-based) networks [5, 7], this scheme has been recently extended to regular switch-based parallel systems [12, 14]. <p> Such an approach will require fewer phases to cover a given multicast destination set than the number of phases required by the best known software multicasting algorithm <ref> [4] </ref> if p &gt; 1. If p = 1, then the number of phases required by the MPM-SSR scheme and the best known software scheme are equal. We have described a simple multi-phase approach for multicast in irregular networks. <p> The estimate we used for a multicast to d destinations is given by: ((t s + t inj + t unicast route + t cons + l fi t cons ) fi dlog 2 (d + 1)e) secs, where l is the message length in flits. As shown in <ref> [4] </ref>, contention free uni-cast based multicast is not always possible in irregular networks. Furthermore, messages may pass through multiple switches and links, so that the propagation cost of these messages may be higher. Actual multicast latency using unicast messages will therefore be higher than our lower bound estimate.

Reference-contexts: Under this scheme, the switches in the network must store enough routing information to decide which output ports must receive a copy of the worm for it to reach all of its destinations. Replication Mechanism: Multidestination routing in switch-based parallel systems requires an efficient replication mechanism at the switches <ref> [6] </ref>. In this paper, we assume that switches adopt the deadlock-free input-buffer-based asynchronous replication mechanism of [14]. Under such a replication mechanism, an arriving multidestination worm at an input buffer of a switch is read by multiple output ports.

This information can be efficiently captured using bit strings similar to the one described above, called reachability strings <ref> [8] </ref>. Every `down' output port has a reachability string associated with it. Bits that are `1' in this string represent nodes that are reachable through the output port.

Arrange these switches in descending order of size according to the number of destinations in each switch.

Reference-contexts: A lot of research has therefore focussed on methods for efficient multicast in parallel systems. These methods have predominantly been proposed for regular networks and fall into two broad categories: unicast-based and multidestination-based multicast. Unicast based multicast typically follows a multi-phase binomial tree based approach <ref> [15] </ref>. A unicast message is sent by the source to a destination in the first phase of this multicast. In every successive phase, the source and the multicast destinations covered up to the beginning of that phase send one message each to one of the remaining destinations.
