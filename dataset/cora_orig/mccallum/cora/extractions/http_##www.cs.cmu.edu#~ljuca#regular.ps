Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The following conjecture has been proposed: Conjecture 1 If G = (V; E) is a -regular simple graph with an even number of vertices at most 2 then G is 1-factorizable ( edge colorable). This conjecture appeared in Chetwynd and Hilton <ref> [3] </ref> but may go back to G. A. Dirac in the early 1950's (Chetwynd and Hilton [3]). An interesting consequence is that for any regular graph G either G or its complement has a 1-factorization. <p> This conjecture appeared in Chetwynd and Hilton <ref> [3] </ref> but may go back to G. A. Dirac in the early 1950's (Chetwynd and Hilton [3]). An interesting consequence is that for any regular graph G either G or its complement has a 1-factorization. <p> There are some partial results regarding Conjecture 1. Chetwynd and Hilton [5] have proved the conjecture if ( 71) 2 jV j. Furthermore Chetwynd and Hilton <ref> [3] </ref> note that R. Haggkvist has announced that for any * &gt; 0 there exists N &gt; 0 so that every -regular graph G is 1-factorizable if G has an even number of vertices greater than N and ( 1 2 + *)jV j.

Reference-contexts: It is not too hard to see that Conjecture 1 is a special case of Hilton's Overfull Subgraph Conjecture (Hilton and Johnson [7], Chetwynd and Hilton <ref> [4] </ref>): Conjecture 2 (Hilton) If G is simple, &gt; jV j 3 and G contains no overfull subgraph then G is edge colorable. There are some partial results regarding Conjecture 1. Chetwynd and Hilton [5] have proved the conjecture if ( 71) 2 jV j.

Reference-contexts: This follows from the fact that in any edge-coloring of G at most jV (H)j1 2 edges in E (H) can have the same color.

A graph G = (V; E) is simple if it contains no multiple edges and no loops.

Reference-contexts: The main idea of the algorithm is that given a graph G we attempt to find a bipartite reduction G 0 of G. Since 0 (G 0 ) = (G 0 ) (by Konig's theorem <ref> [9] </ref>) we will have 0 (G) = (G). 3 To find a bipartite reduction, we first partition the vertices of G into sets H 1 and H 2 of equal size so that a number of conditions hold. We describe this in the following section.

Reference-contexts: Similarly G cannot contain a subgraph H satisfying (ii) of theorem 1. So G is -edge colorable. 2 More importantly, the methods we use in the proof of theorem 1 are very general and have been used to get similar partial results for Hilton's conjecture (Perkovic and Reed <ref> [10] </ref>). These partial results were enough to devise a polynomial expected time algorithm for edge coloring simple graphs (Perkovic and Reed [11]). But the proofs of these results are long and technical, while the proof of theorem 1 is relatively simple. We turn now to the proof of theorem 1.
