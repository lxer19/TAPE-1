Abstract: For data consistency in distributed database systems, it is necessary to compare remotely located copies of a file. The cost of such comparison is in the amount of communication required to identify the erroneous pages in the different copies. We assume that the sites at which the copies reside can communicate only with a primary site that contains an exact copy of the file. The minimum amount of communication necessary to identify any given number of erroneous pages is determined and a technique to attain this minimum is presented.
