Abstract: We present a general-purpose parallel iterative solver for large, sparse systems of linear equations. This solver is used in two applications, a piezoelectric crystal vibration problem and a superconductor model, that could be solved only on the largest available massively parallel machine. Results obtained on the Intel DELTA show computational rates of up to 3.25 gi-gaflops for these applications.

Reference-contexts: Because these modes may interfere with the operation of the crystal, we are also interested in them. We use the finite element method to model the crystal. An efficient 27-node brick element was developed at Argonne and Motorola to accurately model these anisotropic crystals <ref> [1] </ref>. A second-order Lagrangian polynomial is used to interpolate the mechanical and electric field potential; second-order interpolation is necessary to accurately model the thickness-shear mode. A large displacement formulation is used to include nonlinear geometric effects that result from a combination of thermal loads and displacement constraints.

They used a Monte-Carlo simulated annealing algorithm and were able to obtain solutions only for small grid sizes with at most two vortices per unit cell.

Reference-contexts: Finally, in comparison with the performance of L-BFGS on the CRAY-2, we note that an improvement of approximately 95 times was obtained on the Intel DELTA for PROBLEM-3 <ref> [3] </ref>, or an improvement of more than a 100 times when compared to the inexact Newton method.

Reference-contexts: With this method they were able to obtain solutions, for the homogeneous model, for which the gradient norm was reduced to no less than 10 5 on two-dimensional grids of size up to 200 fi 200. More sophisticated techniques were introduced by Garner et al. <ref> [4] </ref> with greatly improved results. Among these methods were three classes of optimization methods: nonlinear conjugate gradient, limited-memory quasi-Newton, and modified Newton methods. Even though they require only the same kind of derivative information as the steepest descent method (that is, first derivatives), these algorithms have much better convergence properties.

Reference-contexts: We use a shifted, inverted variant of the Lanczos algorithm to solve this eigen-problem [13].

Again, the major computational task is the solution of large sparse systems of linear equations. The key to accurately modeling these crystals is our new, second-order finite element.

Reference-contexts: The iterative solver uses an incomplete matrix factorization as a preconditioner for the conjugate gradient algorithm <ref> [12] </ref>. This is a general-purpose preconditioner that performs well for many problems, including the sparse problems arising in the applications with which we are concerned. In fact, examples of the linear systems that arise in these problems cannot be efficiently solved with a simple local precondi-tioner.

Reference-contexts: When these conditions do not hold, local optimization methods are more appropriate. A second group, Wang and Hu, made this observation and used a first-order technique: a steepest descent algorithm with fixed step size <ref> [14] </ref>. With this method they were able to obtain solutions, for the homogeneous model, for which the gradient norm was reduced to no less than 10 5 on two-dimensional grids of size up to 200 fi 200.
