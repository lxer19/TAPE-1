Title: ON MATCHINGS IN GROUPS  
Author: JOZSEF LOSONCZY 
Abstract: A matching property conceived for lattices is examined in the context of an arbitrary abelian group. The Dyson e-transform and the Cauchy-Davenport inequality from additive number theory are used to establish the existence of match-ings.

Reference-contexts: the lattice points with the direction vectors in one-to-one fashion so that the sum within each pair is not one of the given lattice points; moreover, this can be done in such a way that the pairing is uniquely determined by the lattice points, direction vectors and multiset of sums <ref> [1] </ref>. We explore in the present paper the extent to which the above matching property is satisfied by an arbitrary abelian group G. In what follows, A and B will denote nonempty finite subsets of an additive abelian group G which satisfy jAj = jBj and 0 =2 B. <p> Z=7Z is an example of a group that has the matching property but not the acyclic matching property (recall Remark 2.5). However, by combining an observation about torsion-free abelian groups with a construction due to Alon, Fan, Kleitman and Loson-czy <ref> [1] </ref>, we arrive at the following result. ON MATCHINGS IN GROUPS 5 Theorem 4.1. Let G be a torsion-free abelian group. Then G possesses the acyclic matching property. Proof. There exists a total ordering of the elements of G which is compatible with its group structure [7].

Reference-contexts: We conclude that G has the matching property. 4 JOZSEF LOSONCZY Remark 3.2. When G is cyclic of prime order, inequality (5) appearing in the proof of Theorem 3.1 is known as the Cauchy-Davenport inequality. Cauchy <ref> [2] </ref> used it to prove that given a; b; c 2 Z=pZ, where p is prime and a; b 6= 0, the equation ax 2 + by 2 = c has a solution in x, y from Z=pZ.

Reference-contexts: Then jS + T j jSj + jT j 1. This extension of the Cauchy-Davenport inequality is attributed to I. Chowla <ref> [3] </ref>. 4. Acyclicity Suppose that for each pair A, B of nonempty finite subsets of G satisfying jAj = jBj and 0 =2 B, there exists an acyclic matching A ! B. We then say that G possesses the acyclic matching property.

In <ref> [6] </ref>, R n was shown to possess the matching property by introducing an inner product and working with hyperplanes. Theorem 3.1 implies that cyclic groups of prime or infinite order have the matching property. Concerning the other cyclic groups, we can at least say the following. Proposition 3.4. <p> Remark 4.3. Interest in acyclic matchings arose from consideration of the problem of determining the sets of monomials of a generic homogeneous polynomial which are removable through a linear change in variables. For details, see <ref> [6] </ref>. Remark 4.4. The basic matching problem considered in this paper can be reformulated for a non-abelian group G in some obvious ways. Further investigation along those lines could prove to be worthwhile. 5. Acknowledgment The author is indebted to C.

There exists a total ordering of the elements of G which is compatible with its group structure <ref> [7] </ref>. One way to see this is to embed G in some vector space V over the rationals, as follows: G, being the quotient of a direct sum of copies of Z, can be embedded in a quotient D of a direct sum of copies of Q .
