Abstract: We investigate the eigenvalue spacing distributions for randomly generated 4-regular Cayley graphs on SL 2 ( Fp ), S 10 , and large cyclic groups by numerically calculating their spectra. We present strong evidence that the distributions are Poisson and hence do not follow the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. Among the Cayley graphs of SL 2 ( Fp ) that we consider are the new expander graphs recently discovered by Y. Shalom. In addition, we use a Markov chain method to generate random 4-regular graphs, and observe that the average eigenvalue spacings are closely approximated by the Wigner surmise.

Reference-contexts: Remark. In the case in which S [S 1 is a union of conjugacy classes of G, the adjacency matrix can be completely diagonalized and the eigenvalues can be computed as certain character sums over G (see e.g., <ref> [2] </ref>). The above discussion is completely general and indicates the methodology used in each of our three Cayley graph examples, built on the groups S n , Z=nZand SL 2 ( F p ).

Reference-contexts: For comparison we have also computed the spectra for randomly generated 4-regular graphs, using Markov chain methods to generate the graphs. These all closely follow the GOE, and this is in agreement with the extensive computations performed by Jakobson, Miller, Rivin and Rudnick <ref> [5] </ref>. Our computations on SL 2 ( F p ) and the symmetric groups are made possible by the use of the representation theory for these groups (see Section 2). <p> We compare and contrast the behavior of our families of 4-regular Cayley graphs with that of random 4-regular graphs. The former almost always show strong agreement with Poisson behavior, while for the latter, the spacing distributions show GOE behavior (see also <ref> [5] </ref>). 3.1. Random graphs. To generate random 4-regular graphs (not Cayley graphs) we used a Markov chain method.

Reference-contexts: The representation theory of the cyclic groups can be found in any elementary representation theory text (see e.g. [23]) and that of the symmetric groups has been given extensive treatment as well (see e.g. <ref> [6] </ref>).

The sample spacing distribution shown in Figure 6 is representative of the behavior found for each of the generating pairs. In the case of the cyclic group Z=nZ, the spectrum can of course be written down exactly.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction. One of the most remarkable numerical discoveries of the recent past is Odlyzko's finding that the spacings of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function closely follow the Gaussian unitary ensemble of random matrix theory <ref> [16] </ref>. As a result of this work, attention has turned to the spacing distributions for the spectrum of other natural classes of operators, in the hope of making similar connections with other number theoretic objects.

Reference-contexts: One direction of related work is towards the analysis of the eigenvalue spacing distribution for the Laplacian on different manifolds; see <ref> [18] </ref> for a survey of many recent results of this type and an extensive bibliography. The motivation for our work comes from the particular case of interest of the Laplacian on SL 2 (Z)nH, where H denotes the hyperbolic upper half plane.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the explicit Ramanujan graphs for PSL 2 ( F q ) restrict to give Ramanujan graphs on P 1 ( F q ) <ref> [19] </ref>. Our experience [9,10] has been that the spectral properties of the principal and discrete series representations are almost identical, and that the spectral properties of any individual Fourier transform are representative of those of the full Fourier transform. Our results here are consistent with these previous findings.

Reference-contexts: The eigenvalues have a physical interpretation as energy levels, and Poisson behavior of the spacings is usually thought of as characteristic of integrable systems, while GOE corresponds to chaotic systems (cf. [1,4,14] and the many references therein). Computations of Schmit <ref> [20] </ref> indicate that the spacing distribution for SL 2 (Z)nH should be Poisson.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, spectrum (X (G; S)) = h [ spectrum s2S [S 1 ! The degree of the largest irreducible representation of G is bounded above by jGj 1=2 (cf. <ref> [23] </ref>). Thus, if we are able to directly compute the matrices i (s), we are able to reduce the computation from O (jGj 3 ) operations to a more manageable O O (jGj 3=2 ) operations.

Reference-contexts: Direct computation of the spectrum of the jGj fi jGj matrix (G; S) requires O (jGj 3 ) operations (cf. <ref> [26] </ref>). For example, for SL 2 ( F p ), since jSL 2 ( F p )j = O (p 3 ), this means O (p 9 ) operations. This cost quickly becomes prohibitive as p gets large.
