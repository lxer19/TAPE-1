Abstract: SmartAHS is a specification, simulation, and evaluation framework for modeling, control and evaluation of Automated Highway Systems (AHS). SmartAHS is developed using SHIFT, a new programming language with simulation semantics. This paper discusses the requirements that have led to the development of SmartAHS and SHIFT, summarizes the main characteristics of the SHIFT language, describes the components of the SmartAHS framework and its application methodology. An example | implementation of a tactical level human driver model | is presented in detail; it is used as a foundation in the studies and evaluation of the partial automation concepts.

Reference-contexts: At one extreme lie proposals in which a centralized controller determines the position of every vehicle similar to the way trains are controlled. These designs were studied by TRW, GM, Rohr Industries and some other groups, and are reviewed in <ref> [3] </ref>. At the other extreme are proposals that are inspired by robotics and AI-based approaches to the control of an autonomous vehicle navigating in an unstructured and even hostile environment [4,5]. These approaches emphasize recognition, learning, and trajectory planning in the face of diverse threats and obstacles.

Reference-contexts: These approaches emphasize recognition, learning, and trajectory planning in the face of diverse threats and obstacles. Proposals in between these extremes include the PATH proposal for AHS (PATH-AHS) <ref> [6] </ref>. The IVHS strategic plan [7] identifies modeling and simulation as important steps in realizing these transportation initiatives. A software framework in which alternative IVHS strategies can be specified, simulated, and uniformly evaluated is crucial for the cost-effective development and objective comparison of the proposed alternatives.

Reference-contexts: Clearly other criteria such as cost, deployability, social reaction will be important elements in the final comparison of various proposals. For a discussion of a complete set of tools that are being developed for the downselection process the reader is referred to <ref> [8] </ref>. Traditionally simulation granularity of highway traffic has been limited to macro-simulation or meso-simulation. Macro-simulators usually rely on fluid flow models to generate throughput and density information for the highway [9]. Meso-simulators use the fluid flow model to simulate the behavior of the individual vehicles [10].

The modeling challenges in human driver models have made it difficult to have accurate micro-simulation results for highway traffic. However, the elimination of the human driver (or reduction of their role) in automated vehicles obviates (reduces) this problem. Automated vehicles behave deterministically as designed.

Reference-contexts: Since we were dealing with a complex and very large system, there was no hope for closed form mathematical analysis. The need for a simulation environment was obvious and SmartPath was developed <ref> [11] </ref>. In time, several other highway automation architectures, including partial automation concept, were proposed and it became evident that a generalized simulation framework was needed that could facilitate the specification, simulation, and evaluation of different highway automation architectures and the first version of SmartAHS was developed [12].

Reference-contexts: No language, product, or tool in the market nor in academia came close to satisfying all requirements. Many simulation frameworks are available <ref> [13] </ref> that consist of a set of class libraries developed in a programming language such as C++. These frameworks impose semantic notions such as inputs, outputs, events, differential equations etc. onto the C++ syntax and expect the user to follow framework rules for using the class libraries.

Reference-contexts: This approach does not provide the user with any syntactic support for large scale system development. Several discrete event simulation tools exist. However, these tools do not provide enough support for continuous evolution <ref> [14] </ref>. Block-diagram based simulation tools are easy to use, but do not provide the necessary expressive power to represent dynamic interaction patterns among the simulated objects.

SmartAHS Building Blocks Basic SmartAHS building blocks provided by SmartAHS developers are the discussed in <ref> [17] </ref>. The Highway library provides building blocks to create arbitrary highways. The roadway is represented in terms of components of types Section, Segment, Lane. Sections consist of segments and lanes. Segments represent the geometry of a highway.

Reference-contexts: Basic set of Monitor types collect necessary statistics used for concept evaluation. An arbitrary vehicle consists of several types. It contains VehicleDynamics which models vehicle dynamics at the desired level of detail <ref> [18] </ref>, a Controller which is to provide the throttle, steering, and brake inputs, which behavior depends on either it is automated or human controller; and a VREP (Vehicle-Roadway Environment Processor). The Automated Vehicle may also contain Sensor and Communication devices and their environment processors.

Reference-contexts: The throttle controller 5.2.1. The model This model is part of the results of a study carried out by Ford Motor Co. The aim was to find out some control laws that human drivers apply while following another vehicle. The basic controller is a "crossover" control model <ref> [21] </ref>, i.e. a simple feedback loop. What human drivers tend to regulate first is the speed, so that the velocity of their own vehicle is as close as possible as to the followed vehicle's one. But a second loop also controls the headway which is regulated to a constant value.
