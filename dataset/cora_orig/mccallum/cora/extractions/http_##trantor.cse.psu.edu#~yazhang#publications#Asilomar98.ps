Abstract: On-chip interconnect power consumption has become an important issue as technology quickly scales down and the industry embraces system-on-a-chip (SOC). The simple bus structure may become a serious bottleneck in reducing the total chip power consumption and increasing performance due to transmission line effects. Alternative interconnect structures should be considered under this circumstances. This paper models the power consumption of both a global data bus and the proposed segmented bus for a commercial chip at the behavioral level. The chip is an integration of a 16-bit DSP and a 32-bit RISC microcontroller. The power measurements of both bus structures at different technology feature size levels are reported for a set of standard signal processing benchmarks.

Reference-contexts: The power estimation is based on the behavioral level simulation of a commercial chip. 2. Segmented Bus Versus Single Bus The commercial chip under study is an integration of a 16-bit DSP engine and a 32-bit RISC core <ref> [1] </ref>. Figure 1 shows its main block diagram. The chip consists of the on-chip X-memory, the on-chip Y-memory, the CPU core, the DSP engine and three global data buses and the corresponding address buses. All buses are static.

Reference-contexts: Figure 3 shows an overview of the power simulator. The architectural simulator consists of the assembler, the controller, and the datap-ath implemented as many functional units m. The simulator provides the precise behavior and functional unit state information <ref> [2] </ref>. The simulator generates the data sequence on the IDB bus every cycle for the simple bus structure. It also generates the data on the segmented bus every cycle: either the IDB CPU, the IDB DSP or the IDB FETCH for segmented bus architecture.

Reference-contexts: The power consumption can be described by: P ower = 1 fi V 2 where V dd is the supply voltage, C represents the load capacitance, and f is the number of wire switchings per second. Thus, one way to reduce power consumption is to reduce capacitance <ref> [3] </ref>. The parasitic effects introduced by interconnect increase as device dimensions are reduced and dominate the performance in sub-micron technologies [3]. As interconnect ca pacitance begins to dominate gate capacitance, careful design of interconnects is critical for capacitive power minimization. <p> Thus, one way to reduce power consumption is to reduce capacitance <ref> [3] </ref>. The parasitic effects introduced by interconnect increase as device dimensions are reduced and dominate the performance in sub-micron technologies [3]. As interconnect ca pacitance begins to dominate gate capacitance, careful design of interconnects is critical for capacitive power minimization. A bus has been used traditionally for datapath interconnect because of its simplicity.

Reference-contexts: The most visible driving factor contributing to this trend is the growth of portable computing and digitally-based communication devices. Power dissipation is also an issue in high performance systems in which circuit cooling requirements affect packaging cost and circuit reliability <ref> [4] </ref>. The power consumption can be described by: P ower = 1 fi V 2 where V dd is the supply voltage, C represents the load capacitance, and f is the number of wire switchings per second.
