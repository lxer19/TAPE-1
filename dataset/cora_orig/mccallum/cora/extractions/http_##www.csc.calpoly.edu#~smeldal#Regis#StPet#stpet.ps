Abstract: Walicki and Meldal have defined a calculus DEQ ("Disjunctive EQuational calculus") for reasoning about nondeterministic operators when specifying nondeterministic systems in an equation-oriented style. A variant of DEQ, the calculus DEQ fl for axiomatic equality theories with cut-like rules introducing as cut formulas only the negative equalities of a specific axiom, is constructed. For pure positive specific axioms (i.e. with empty antecedents) and for so called non-contrary equality theories DEQ fl does not contain cut-like rules at all. The variant of the calculus DEQ fl without structural rules of contraction and exchange is constructed. A simple cut-elimination procedure for axiomatic equality theories is presented.

Reference-contexts: Nondeterminism is also a natural concept in describing sequential programs, either as a means of indicating a don't care attitude as to which among a number of computational paths will actually be utilized in a particular computation or as a means of increasing the level of abstraction <ref> [3] </ref>. In terms of satisfiability, allowing nondeterminism is quite distinct from underspecification. The latter, though admitting 1 distinct models, still insists on a function always returning a particular value, given a particular list of arguments. In the case of nondeterministic operators this is no longer true.

DEQ fl contains a cut-like rule introducing as cut formulas only the negative equalities of specific axioms.

Reference-contexts: Therefore the complex notion of the variant of a formula is unnecessary. If m = 0 then the (Sp: = k) rules are purely cut-free. Analogous rules (corresponding to the case when m = 0) were presented in <ref> [6] </ref> for arithmetical robinson system and at the same time no cut-like rule was not introduced for the specific axiom containing a negative equality.
