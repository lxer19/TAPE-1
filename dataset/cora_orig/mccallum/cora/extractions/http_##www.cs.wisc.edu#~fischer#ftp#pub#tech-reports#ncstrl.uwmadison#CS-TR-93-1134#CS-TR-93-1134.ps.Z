Abstract: We study equations of the form (ff = x) which are single axioms for groups of exponent 4, where ff is a term in product only. Every such ff must have at least 9 variable occurrences, and there are exactly three such ff of this size, up to variable renaming and mirroring. These terms were found by an exhaustive search through all terms of this form. Automated techniques were used in two ways: to eliminate many ff by verifying that (ff = x) true in some non-group, and to verify that the group axioms do indeed follow from the successful (ff = x). x0. Introduction. If n 1 is an integer, a group of exponent n is a group in which x n is the identity for all elements x. We study equations of the form (ff = x) which are single axioms for groups of exponent n, where ff is a term in product only. First, some notation on terms. We shall use the binary function symbol t to denote the group product. We shall also sometimes use standard infix algebraic notation as an abbreviation, with products associating to the right. Thus, for example, x y z and xyz both abbreviate the term t(x; t(y; z)). We use exponentiation as a further abbreviation, with x 1 abbreviating x and x n+1 abbreviating x x n . Let RA(ff) result from associating all products in ff to the right; thus, for example RA(t(t(x; y); t(z; u))) is t(x; t(y; t(z; u))), which is the same as xyzu by our conventions on algebraic notation. Because of the finite exponent, we can express all the group axioms in terms of product only. Thus, we say, a group of exponent n is a model for the following set of three axioms: The variables x; y; z are understood to be universally quantified. For n = 1, G2 reduces to x = y, so the only model is the trivial 1-element group. For n &gt; 1, G2 says that x n is some constant, e. Then, by G2, we have x n = e, and, since x n is really the term x x n1 , we have a right inverse, x n1 , for each x. G3 says that e is a right identity, so G1,G2,G3 are equivalent to the usual statement of the axioms for groups of exponent n. If ff is a term constructed from t and variables, then we say that the equation (ff = x) is a single axiom for groups of exponent n iff (ff = x) is valid in all groups of exponent n

This search is similar in spirit to the ones described in <ref> [2] </ref>. We can figure out ahead of time how many terms to expect in such a search. Let a n be the number of ways to associate a product of n terms.

Reference-contexts: The single axioms produced by Neumann [8] had V (ff) = n 4 2n 2 + n + 1 (see x5), which is quite a bit larger than this minimum. However, it is known that for n = 2 (Meredith Prior [7]) and for n odd (McCune - Wos <ref> [6] </ref>), there are single axioms with V (ff) = 2n + 1. The situation for even n &gt; 2 remained open. In this paper, we settle the question for n = 4 by showing that there are single axioms of minimal size (V (ff) = 9): 0.2 Theorem. <p> Then (ff = x) is a single group axiom iff (ff m = x) is. This mirror symmetry was also exploited by McCune and Wos <ref> [5, 6] </ref>; it cuts the search space in half. A renaming of an equation is an equation obtained by changing the names of some (possibly all, or possibly none) of the variables. <p> Suppose that (ff = x) is a single axiom for groups and V (ff) = 9. Then some renaming of (ff = x) or of (ff m = x) is one of A0,A1,A2. In contrast, McCune and Wos <ref> [6] </ref> found 14 different single axioms of minimal size for exponent 5 groups, and we do not know if there are any more. <p> We may immediately cut the 1430 candidates in half, to 715, by using mirror symme try, as did McCune and Wos <ref> [5, 6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: 1 This research was supported by NSF Grant DMS-9100665. 1 and every model for (ff = x) satisfies G1,G2,G3. Neumann <ref> [8] </ref> proved that such ff exist, but his single axioms were quite large, and it is natural to ask whether simpler ones exist. Let V (ff) be the number of variable occurrences in ff. <p> If V (ff) = 2n + 1, and n &gt; 3 is even, then RA (ff) is of the form y n xz n , where y; z are two distinct variables other than x.

The single axioms produced by Neumann <ref> [8] </ref> had V (ff) = n 4 2n 2 + n + 1 (see x5), which is quite a bit larger than this minimum. <p> Now, only A0,A1,A2 and their mirrors remain. x5. Neumann's single axiom. If one is concerned just with the existence of single axioms, rather than their size, then Theorem 3 of Neumann <ref> [8] </ref> is much more general than the results presented here.
