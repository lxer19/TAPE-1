Reference-contexts: What is `far' is one context may be `near' in another. Recently, there has been much work in the development of quantitative methods for evaluating the applicability of various topological relations within a given context <ref> [1, 29, 56, 65] </ref>. Directional spatial relations, such as left-of and right-of, require a frame of reference. <p> Without an explicit statement of what each model guarantees to be true of the actual spatial scene, some of the conclusions based on a qualitative spatial model can be counterintuitive, or even false. For example, Abella and Kender <ref> [1] </ref> define `near' to be true when the rectangular shape abstractions of two objects intersect, as shown in Figure 2.2. <p> While this approach is 31 quite appropriate for navigation and route finding, queries about the areas of overlap between objects, or the intrinsic fronts of objects, are inexpressible. Rectangular bounding boxes and bounding cubes are a commonly used shape abstraction method for multi-dimensional objects <ref> [1, 8, 37, 53, 57, 77] </ref>. Other shape abstractions which have been used include convex hulls [11], and symbolic arrays [30]. For our purposes, convex hulls are inappropriate since they require quantitative knowledge of the shapes of objects to describe and maintain. <p> Chang and Jungert exploit the same properties of minimum bounding rectangles that we do. However, our spatial representation is broader as we consider problems involving rotation and problems requiring knowledge of the orientation of individual surfaces of objects. Abella and Kender <ref> [1] </ref> draw a bounding box based on a mathematical abstraction, inertia tensors, as illustrated in Figure 2.2. This method is inappropriate for our use since the definitions used are quantitative, the abstractions don't meet our adequacy criterion, and only static scenes are considered. <p> For example, what is `near' in one context may be considered as `far' in another. Much of the existing work in modeling these topological relations has focused on the development of quantitative techniques for measuring the applicability of these relations in a given context <ref> [1, 29, 49, 65] </ref>. The topological relations of primary interest in our work are those based on containment, since a magnetic field can only affect objects that are in the field. <p> Two other types of topological relations are those that are dependent on distance, such as near and far, and those that are path-based, such as along. As argued by several researchers <ref> [49, 1, 29, 65] </ref>, the interpretation of these relations could be context-dependent. Therefore, quantitative analysis could be required to determine whether a given relation would apply to two objects. A combined qualitative-qualitative approach, such as that adopted by Brajnik [6], could prove to be useful in modeling these relations.

Reference-contexts: A number of tools have been developed by many research communities to assist human users with spatial reasoning tasks, and there is much interest in the continued development of such tools with even greater capabilities <ref> [55, 79, 2] </ref>. The following examples illustrate the broad interest in tools with spatial reasoning capabilities. Computer aided design (CAD) tools [81] automatically keep track of numerical spatial constraints between objects, such as distances between objects.

Reference-contexts: Unmanned robots can make use of specialized mapping techniques to explore unknown environments [12, 45, 46]. Image databases are using retrieval techniques based on spatial models [8, 7, 52], and there are projects in natural language processing for producing natural language descriptions of a spatial scene <ref> [3, 39, 53, 77] </ref>, and for visualizing a spatial scene based on natural language descriptions [29, 49, 56, 65]. <p> CITYTOUR, as described in [77], uses rectangular bounding boxes aligned with the intrinsic fronts of objects, as illustrated in Figure 2.5. The goal of CITY-TOUR, along with other research that is part of the VITRA (VIsual TRAnslator) project, <ref> [3, 29, 53] </ref>, is to develop methods for qualitatively reasoning about visual descriptions of a spatial scene. Retz-Schmidt does not provide any qualitative model for the bounding abstractions that are used.

Reference-contexts: For example, in previous work, it is assumed that the pictorial input is provided in visual (raster) form, such as a camera image. In such cases, it becomes necessary to perform visual scene interpretation <ref> [4] </ref> simply to identify the pictorial objects of interest. There can be many ambiguities. <p> Understanding pictorial input in visual (raster) form requires visual scene interpretation <ref> [4] </ref>, and processing text intended for human-to-human communication can require a sophisticated natural language processing system to resolve the ambiguities that may be present.

Reference-contexts: These terms require a perspective, or vantage point. When a vantage point is not 64 explicitly specified, such as `there is clockwise current flow in the wire loop', we will assume that the vantage point is looking in from infinity on the positive Z-axis. Following standard conventions <ref> [5] </ref>, for modeling rotation, a counterclockwise rotation will considered positive, and a clockwise rotation will be considered negative, whereas, for modeling the direction of current flow, clockwise will be considered as positive, and counterclockwise will be considered as negative. 4.1.3 Modeling the Connectivity of an Object To reason about the orientation

Reference-contexts: In the current implementation, variables that are dependent on piecewise-continuous variables must also be modeled as piecewise-continuous (by the model builder) since their values could also change discontinuously. The results of Brajnik <ref> [6] </ref> could be used to remove this restriction on the model builder. Brajnik is using knowledge of 116 dependency relations between variables to automatically infer, given a set of user--defined piecewise-continuous variables, the set of other model variables that must also be modeled as piecewise-continuous variables. <p> As argued by several researchers [49, 1, 29, 65], the interpretation of these relations could be context-dependent. Therefore, quantitative analysis could be required to determine whether a given relation would apply to two objects. A combined qualitative-qualitative approach, such as that adopted by Brajnik <ref> [6] </ref>, could prove to be useful in modeling these relations. Rotation in the X-Y Plane We presented arguments in Chapter 4 that reasoning qualitatively about the change in the orientation of an object as it rotates in the X-Y plane appears to be an inherently ambiguous problem.

Some spatial models used for retrieval from image databases <ref> [8, 52] </ref>, for example, describe the spatial extent of an object through a minimal bounding rectangle drawn around the object. However, for the purposes of describing the relative positions between objects, only the centers of the bounding rectangles are compared. <p> While this approach is 31 quite appropriate for navigation and route finding, queries about the areas of overlap between objects, or the intrinsic fronts of objects, are inexpressible. Rectangular bounding boxes and bounding cubes are a commonly used shape abstraction method for multi-dimensional objects <ref> [1, 8, 37, 53, 57, 77] </ref>. Other shape abstractions which have been used include convex hulls [11], and symbolic arrays [30]. For our purposes, convex hulls are inappropriate since they require quantitative knowledge of the shapes of objects to describe and maintain. <p> In the models that use them, the criteria for drawing rectangular shape abstractions vary greatly. Chang <ref> [8] </ref>, Jungert [37], and Maass [53] draw a minimum bounding rectangle or cube around each object based on an extrinsic Cartesian coordinate system. Chang and Jungert exploit the same properties of minimum bounding rectangles that we do. <p> In our work, all directional relations are defined with respect to a Cartesian coordinate system. Then, as pointed out by Chang <ref> [8] </ref> and Jungert [37], directional relations can be modeled in terms of the projected length of an object onto each of the X and Y axes of the Cartesian coordinate system.

Reference-contexts: We have developed a new representation for qualitative spatial reasoning which incorporates many of the ideas in previous work for reasoning about the spatial extent, relative position, and orientation of objects, and yet, is compatible with existing methods <ref> [9, 17, 20, 42] </ref> for qualitative modeling and simulation of physical systems. Our spatial representation allows qualitative reasoning about both static worlds and worlds with spatial change due to translational or rotational motion. <p> The magnetic fields problems are solved through qualitative simulation, and the implementation makes use of the QPC <ref> [9, 17] </ref> and QSIM [42, 43] qualitative reasoning systems, and the Algernon [10] knowledge representation system. <p> Third, we have implemented the ability to directly model temporary spatial entities, such as a magnetic field created by current flow in an object. This complements the capabilities of existing qualitative modeling systems such as QPC <ref> [9, 17] </ref>, which allow only continuous objects to be modeled. Our techniques will now allow `piecewise-continuous' entities to be modeled directly in the framework of these systems. Fourth, we recognized that when reasoning about dynamic changes in spatial relations, some parameters of interest could be piecewise-continuous. <p> If clockwise current flow is considered positive, there will be a discontinuous change in the value of the current after a ninety degree rotation, since its value will go from positive to undefined to negative without passing through zero. The existing qualitative modeling and simulation systems, such QPC <ref> [9, 17] </ref>, QPE [21], and QSIM [42, 43], do not provide the capability for directly modeling and reasoning about piecewise-continuous parameters. We have also developed 14 techniques to allow `piecewise-continuous' variables to be modeled directly in the framework of these systems. <p> Then, if the problem involves reasoning about motion, an input description compatible with the QPC qualitative modeling and simulation system <ref> [9, 17, 16] </ref> is generated, and a solution is obtained through qualitative simulation. All information is maintained within an Algernon [10] object-oriented knowledge base. All objects in an Algernon knowledge base must be instances of object classes. The objects classes in Algernon are defined through a taxonomy. <p> In many cases, there may not be a way to precisely determine which of these qualitatively significant changes will happen first. In such situations, qualitative simulations systems such as QPC <ref> [9, 17] </ref> and QSIM [42, 43] automatically consider all combinations and simulate the effects of each as a separate behavior path. <p> In the example of Figure 3.7, a query of right-of in terms of this intrinsic coordinate system would be treated as query of below in terms of the extrinsic coordinate system. 3.6.3 Modeling Spatial Relations Through QPC Views For problems involving motion, the QPC <ref> [9, 17] </ref> implementation of spatial model is used to solve the problem through qualitative simulation. All parameters of interest in the qualitative simulation are modeled as QPC variables, or quantity-types. <p> The effect of translational motion on a given spatial scene is determined by studying the changes in the truth values of the inequality constraints which describe the spatial relations that are true in the scene. Finally, since qualitative simulation systems such as QPC <ref> [9] </ref> reason primarily with inequality constraints on model variables, we showed that our model of the relative positions of objects and the translational motion of objects could be implemented in a straight-forward fashion within the framework of these existing qualitative simulation systems. 61 Chapter 4 Modeling Orientation and Rotational Motion This <p> to the problem of the loop moving down the track, and solutions to problems which require reasoning about the principles of operation of transformers, oscillators, and generators. 8.1 Static World Examples Our spatial representation has been implemented as production rules in Algernon [10], and as model fragments in a QPC <ref> [9, 16] </ref> model library. The rule-based implementation is intended for reasoning about problems involving static worlds, and forms the basis of the spatial reasoning component of the Figure Understander. We have also used the rule-based, static-world, implementation of our spatial model in two other applications. <p> spatial properties of a physical system. 8.2 The Implemented QPC Model Libraries Our methods for spatial reasoning about dynamic change in the relations positions and orientation of objects, including methods for reasoning about the effects of translational and rotational motion, have been implemented as model fragments (views) in the QPC <ref> [9, 17] </ref> qualitative modeling and simulation system. These views form a domain-independent model library for qualitative spatial reasoning, and may be referenced in any given domain model.

Reference-contexts: The magnetic fields problems are solved through qualitative simulation, and the implementation makes use of the QPC [9, 17] and QSIM [42, 43] qualitative reasoning systems, and the Algernon <ref> [10] </ref> knowledge representation system. <p> Once the input has been processed, if the problem involves dynamic change, we use a QPC-based implementation of our spatial model to solve the problem through qualitative simulation [71]. If the problem involves a static scene, we can instead use an Algernon <ref> [10] </ref> rule-based implementation of our spatial model to solve the problem [70, 73]. The use of diagrams to describe the spatial scene serves two purposes. One is convenience. <p> Then, if the problem involves reasoning about motion, an input description compatible with the QPC qualitative modeling and simulation system [9, 17, 16] is generated, and a solution is obtained through qualitative simulation. All information is maintained within an Algernon <ref> [10] </ref> object-oriented knowledge base. All objects in an Algernon knowledge base must be instances of object classes. The objects classes in Algernon are defined through a taxonomy. Relations 17 18 (slots) and forward and backward chaining inference rules can be defined on these classes. <p> reaches the world boundary first; (2) where the Lef t of (B; C) relation is violated first; and (3) where both events happen at the same time. 3.6 Implementation of our Relative Position Model Our model of the relative positions of objects has been implemented in the form of Algernon <ref> [10] </ref> rules in the spatial KB, and as views in qualitative process theory [20, 17] for problems to be solved through qualitative simulation. <p> ((member steady-uniform-magnetic-fields ?obj) (source-of-field ?obj permanent))) (motion-vectors ((member velocity-vectors ?obj)))) :individual-object-semantics ((conducting-loop ; Group Label (mobile-conducting-loop ; Object Label ; special properties of object type to assert into the KB.

For example, under :object-group-semantics, we have specified that all diagram objects of the group `conducting-loops' are members of the knowledge base class `conducting-loops', and that they have the property of being solid objects. <p> The Figure Understander takes as input a Postscript file for a diagram produced using the Interviews graphical drawing tool, a Picture Semantics description for the diagram, one or more sentences of descriptive text, and an Algernon <ref> [10] </ref> knowledge base. It outputs an integrated description of the information in each form of input, diagram and text, into the knowledge base. 5.4.1 Diagram Processing The strength of the Figure Understander lies in its diagram interpretation capabilities. <p> In Figure 5.5, the function make-variable is used to return a variable name, such as ?V1 or ?V2, to be substituted into the :the from. Algernon's <ref> [10] </ref> definite description facility (:the) is used to connect object references in text to objects in the knowledge base (KB). <p> Then, production rules of the form described in Figure 6.8 are applied to this quantitative description to extract a qualitative description of the relative positions of objects in the initial scene. The rule in Figure 6.8, from the spatial KB, is expressed in the syntax of the Algernon <ref> [10] </ref> knowledge representation language. Recall from Section 2.4.4 that the predicates Rightmost and Leftmost hold the physical coordinate values for the rightmost and leftmost points of the bounding boxes computed for objects. <p> representative set of five problems, including the solution to the problem of the loop moving down the track, and solutions to problems which require reasoning about the principles of operation of transformers, oscillators, and generators. 8.1 Static World Examples Our spatial representation has been implemented as production rules in Algernon <ref> [10] </ref>, and as model fragments in a QPC [9, 16] model library. The rule-based implementation is intended for reasoning about problems involving static worlds, and forms the basis of the spatial reasoning component of the Figure Understander.

Reference-contexts: the effects of kinematic constraints on objects in motion [14, 15, 23, 36, 40, 61], modeling qualitative vector algebra [89], reasoning about the relative positions and orientation of objects in an urban scene [27, 50, 57], and reasoning about changes in spatial relations due to the translation motion of objects <ref> [11, 28] </ref>, or due to changes in the size and shape of objects [13]. 1 1.2 Properties of Spatial Models All of the tools mentioned above make use of spatial models to accomplish their goals. <p> The previous work can be roughly divided into two categories: work toward the development of spatial models to support specific, complex real-world applications (e.g., [23, 53]), and work toward the development of formal, intuitive theories for qualitative spatial reasoning (e.g., <ref> [25, 33, 11] </ref>). The most powerful spatial models are associated with the former category, and allow reasoning about both static worlds and worlds where is translation and rotational motion. They allow reasoning about both the relative positions and orientation of objects, and can handle both 2 and 3-dimensional objects. <p> Further, each of these models has been tested only on small examples, and their applicability for solving complex problems in larger reasoning systems is yet to be demonstrated. For example, Cui, Cohn, and 4 Randell <ref> [11] </ref> provide an axiomatic description of topological spatial relations such as disconnected, touching, and enclosed, but cannot reason explicitly about motion. <p> This facilitates reasoning about the most important issues and allows one to abstract away unimportant details. As examples of accidental dependencies of quantitative knowledge, consider Cui, Cohn, and Randell's <ref> [11] </ref> assumption that a `convex hull' function is available to provide the convex hulls of the objects in a scene. Since they allow objects to be of any shape, the convex hull function will require a quantitative description of the shape of each object. <p> Rectangular bounding boxes and bounding cubes are a commonly used shape abstraction method for multi-dimensional objects [1, 8, 37, 53, 57, 77]. Other shape abstractions which have been used include convex hulls <ref> [11] </ref>, and symbolic arrays [30]. For our purposes, convex hulls are inappropriate since they require quantitative knowledge of the shapes of objects to describe and maintain. <p> Particularly when the spatial extents of objects are described through rectangular bounding boxes, it is straightforward to qualitatively model containment-based topological relations. 3.4.1 Previous Work in Modeling Containment Relations Cui, Cohn, and Randell <ref> [11] </ref> and Egenhofer and Al-Taha [13] both present models of topological spatial relations related to the property of containment. In their work, each topological relation is modeled as a state, and much of the discussion focuses on what transitions are possible between states. <p> For example, from the state of being disconnected, the next topological state that two object can enter is one where the objects are touching each other. The binary topological relations considered in the work of Cui, et. al. <ref> [11] </ref> and Egenhofer, et. al. [13] are the states disconnected/disjoint, touching/meet, partial overlap, covered-by, equals, covers, inside, and contains. Here, covered-by and covers refer to states where one object is inside the other, but where there is still contact between the boundaries of the objects. <p> However, they do not provide any qualitative model for the positions of objects or for quali 42 43 tatively detecting when state changes occur. Similar to our interest, Cui, Cohn, and Randell <ref> [11] </ref> are interested in describing the possible changes in containment-based topological relations between objects due to the translational motion of objects. <p> While it may be important to base the choice of a bounding shape abstraction on the accuracy of the conclusions it provides, the ease of reasoning qualitatively about the chosen shape abstraction should also be a factor. For example, Cui, Cohn, and Randell <ref> [11] </ref> use convex hulls to bound objects, which are likely to provide a better approximation of the actual spatial extents of objects than rectangular bounding boxes. However, Cui, Cohn, and Randell rely on an external quantitative function to compute the convex hulls of objects.

The rule-based implementation is intended for reasoning about problems involving static worlds, and forms the basis of the spatial reasoning component of the Figure Understander. We have also used the rule-based, static-world, implementation of our spatial model in two other applications.

Reference-contexts: Further, as this work has been performed within a larger effort to develop techniques for qualitative modeling and simulation of real world phenomena <ref> [17, 26, 38, 43, 44, 78] </ref>, two other needs arise: to develop a spatial 6 model that supports integrated reasoning about simultaneous dynamic change in both the spatial and non-spatial properties of a given system, and to develop a model which guarantees that all real behaviors achievable from an initial state <p> We have developed a new representation for qualitative spatial reasoning which incorporates many of the ideas in previous work for reasoning about the spatial extent, relative position, and orientation of objects, and yet, is compatible with existing methods <ref> [9, 17, 20, 42] </ref> for qualitative modeling and simulation of physical systems. Our spatial representation allows qualitative reasoning about both static worlds and worlds with spatial change due to translational or rotational motion. <p> The magnetic fields problems are solved through qualitative simulation, and the implementation makes use of the QPC <ref> [9, 17] </ref> and QSIM [42, 43] qualitative reasoning systems, and the Algernon [10] knowledge representation system. <p> Third, we have implemented the ability to directly model temporary spatial entities, such as a magnetic field created by current flow in an object. This complements the capabilities of existing qualitative modeling systems such as QPC <ref> [9, 17] </ref>, which allow only continuous objects to be modeled. Our techniques will now allow `piecewise-continuous' entities to be modeled directly in the framework of these systems. Fourth, we recognized that when reasoning about dynamic changes in spatial relations, some parameters of interest could be piecewise-continuous. <p> If clockwise current flow is considered positive, there will be a discontinuous change in the value of the current after a ninety degree rotation, since its value will go from positive to undefined to negative without passing through zero. The existing qualitative modeling and simulation systems, such QPC <ref> [9, 17] </ref>, QPE [21], and QSIM [42, 43], do not provide the capability for directly modeling and reasoning about piecewise-continuous parameters. We have also developed 14 techniques to allow `piecewise-continuous' variables to be modeled directly in the framework of these systems. <p> Then, if the problem involves reasoning about motion, an input description compatible with the QPC qualitative modeling and simulation system <ref> [9, 17, 16] </ref> is generated, and a solution is obtained through qualitative simulation. All information is maintained within an Algernon [10] object-oriented knowledge base. All objects in an Algernon knowledge base must be instances of object classes. The objects classes in Algernon are defined through a taxonomy. <p> In many cases, there may not be a way to precisely determine which of these qualitatively significant changes will happen first. In such situations, qualitative simulations systems such as QPC <ref> [9, 17] </ref> and QSIM [42, 43] automatically consider all combinations and simulate the effects of each as a separate behavior path. <p> relation is violated first; and (3) where both events happen at the same time. 3.6 Implementation of our Relative Position Model Our model of the relative positions of objects has been implemented in the form of Algernon [10] rules in the spatial KB, and as views in qualitative process theory <ref> [20, 17] </ref> for problems to be solved through qualitative simulation. In the sections below, a brief overview of the implementation is provided. 50 3.6.1 Algernon Rules for Modeling Relative Positions The Algernon implementation is used by the Figure Understander [73] in processing references to spatial relations in text input. <p> In the example of Figure 3.7, a query of right-of in terms of this intrinsic coordinate system would be treated as query of below in terms of the extrinsic coordinate system. 3.6.3 Modeling Spatial Relations Through QPC Views For problems involving motion, the QPC <ref> [9, 17] </ref> implementation of spatial model is used to solve the problem through qualitative simulation. All parameters of interest in the qualitative simulation are modeled as QPC variables, or quantity-types. <p> A QPC view has three basic components. The individuals are the world objects to which the view applies. In Figure 3.8, the views aligned-X-view and left-of-view apply to any two convex 2-dimensional objects. In describing the individuals of interest, other conditions, called the structural conditions for the view <ref> [17, 20] </ref>, may be specified. For example, the view bb-overlap-view also applies to two convex, 2-dimensional objects, but has the additional conditions that one of the objects must be a solid object and one must be a permeable object. <p> The spatial KB contains primitives for describing the connectivity of polygons, the bounding shapes of objects, the relative positions of objects, and the orientation of objects. 112 Chapter 7 Enhancements For Qualitative Modeling This chapter describes three important extensions to the modeling capabilities of QPC <ref> [17, 16] </ref>. These extensions all address general modeling needs that are insufficiently supported by the existing qualitative modeling and simulation systems, such as QPC [16], QPE [20], and QSIM [42]. We found the modeling capabilities of these systems to be insufficient for modeling the following features of a given domain. <p> To successfully model such variables in QPC, we have added the ability to directly assert that some variables have a circular quantity space. 7.1 Modeling Piecewise Continuous Variables Several qualitative modeling tools, such as QPC <ref> [17] </ref> and QPE [20], require model variables to be continuous. For many problems, it is possible for certain model variables to be piecewise-continuous. For example, consider Forbus's example [20] of boiling water in a closed container. <p> and Y 270 is insignificant in the new model and may be ignored, or modeled as &lt; or &gt;, since the relationship in the previous model (&gt;) will not have been inherited. 7.4 Chapter Summary In this chapter, we described three important extensions to the modeling capabilities of the QPC <ref> [17, 16] </ref> qualitative modeling system. <p> spatial properties of a physical system. 8.2 The Implemented QPC Model Libraries Our methods for spatial reasoning about dynamic change in the relations positions and orientation of objects, including methods for reasoning about the effects of translational and rotational motion, have been implemented as model fragments (views) in the QPC <ref> [9, 17] </ref> qualitative modeling and simulation system. These views form a domain-independent model library for qualitative spatial reasoning, and may be referenced in any given domain model.

For example, if Forbus's example <ref> [20] </ref> of heating water inside a covered pot were implemented in QPC, previously, it would have been possible only to simulate the fact that the cover could be blown off the pot. The consequences of this event could not be simulated since the pressure inside the pot would change discontinuously.

Reference-contexts: Further, within the research area of Qualitative Reasoning [90, 43], the topic area of this dissertation, many spatial models have been proposed for performing a number of diverse tasks, including, but not limited to, the effects of kinematic constraints on objects in motion <ref> [14, 15, 23, 36, 40, 61] </ref>, modeling qualitative vector algebra [89], reasoning about the relative positions and orientation of objects in an urban scene [27, 50, 57], and reasoning about changes in spatial relations due to the translation motion of objects [11, 28], or due to changes in the size and <p> In such applications, simplying shape abstractions, such as a rectangle, can be used to approximate the space occupied by an object. If the problem domain is reasoning about the kinematic properties of objects, 2 such as whether two gears will mesh together <ref> [23, 36, 62] </ref>, then knowledge of the exact shapes and sizes of object is very important. To model the exact shapes and sizes of objects, a numerical model may be necessary. <p> When an application requires the positions of two multi-dimensional objects to be compared, if the model uses exact shapes, relations such as right-of and overlapped may need to be defined quantitatively, such as the Configuration Space-based 3 definitions used in much of the work on qualitative reasoning about mechanical con-straints <ref> [14, 15, 23, 36, 62] </ref>. If simplifying abstract shapes (i.e., `idealizations' [35, 47]) are used to describe the bounds of objects, then it becomes easier to develop qualitative definitions of directional and topological spatial relations that take advantage of the simpler properties of the chosen abstract shapes. <p> The previous work can be roughly divided into two categories: work toward the development of spatial models to support specific, complex real-world applications (e.g., <ref> [23, 53] </ref>), and work toward the development of formal, intuitive theories for qualitative spatial reasoning (e.g., [25, 33, 11]). The most powerful spatial models are associated with the former category, and allow reasoning about both static worlds and worlds where is translation and rotational motion. <p> They allow reasoning about both the relative positions and orientation of objects, and can handle both 2 and 3-dimensional objects. The drawback is that these models require quantitative descriptions of the spatial scene, such as a video image [53] or a configuration space representation <ref> [23] </ref>. The models in the second class have the advantage of being both intuitive and elegant, but each of these qualitative models addresses only a small subset of the many spatial reasoning issues. <p> If a problem requires reasoning about the exact shapes of objects, such as whether two gears will mesh together, a solution approach which combines qualitative and quantitative reasoning, like the methods developed for reasoning about the qualitative features of a configuration space representation <ref> [23, 36] </ref>, will be required. Fortunately, there are many spatial reasoning problems which can be solved with only qualitative information about the spatial scene. <p> objects with respect to one frame of reference, can the relative positions of the objects be determined if the frame of reference is changed? Freksa [27] is actively pursuing solutions to this problem. 180 Mechanical Constraint Problems Recently, there has been much work in solving kinematics problems through qualitative reasoning <ref> [23, 36, 40] </ref>. The methods that have been developed rely primarily on the use of Configuration Spaces [23] to provide as input a description of all the legal spatial configurations of a kinematic system. <p> The methods that have been developed rely primarily on the use of Configuration Spaces <ref> [23] </ref> to provide as input a description of all the legal spatial configurations of a kinematic system. The interesting qualitative behaviors are determined by studying the motions that are possible based on the Configuration Space for a given system.

Similarly, Freksa <ref> [27] </ref> focuses only on the issue of reasoning about the orientation of objects. Further, many of the formal models appear to be qualitative in nature, but an actual reasoning system may require a fair amount of precise metric information to use the definitions. <p> As in Chapter 3, all references to an extrinsic, Cartesian coordinate should be interpreted to mean the final extrinsic coordinate system which has been chosen for the problem. 4.1 Modeling the Orientation of Surfaces of Objects As discussed by Freksa <ref> [27] </ref>, Mukerjee and Joe [58], and Nielsen [62], for a 2-dimensional object confined to the X-Y plane, there are 8 qualitative orientations for any surface of an object. These are shown in Figure 4.1. <p> For any surface which lies between the leftmost and topmost vertices or edges, the orientation vector is (-1 1). 63 4.1.1 Modeling Surface Tangent Directions Knowledge of the surface normal direction of a surface is sufficient for such applications as modeling the intrinsic or deictic front direction of an object <ref> [27, 58] </ref>. For modeling such properties as the direction of current flow along a surface of a conducting object, or to model the direction of a frictional force acting on an object [62], we need the surface tangent direction of each surface of interest. <p> This is because the task of translating a qualitative spatial term such as `right-of' used with respect to the frame of reference of the diagram to one compatible with a rotated frame of reference is inherently ambiguous in the general case. This has been demonstrated formally by Freksa <ref> [27] </ref>. For example, the diagram in Figure 5.2 is automatically rotated by the Figure Understander to produce the one in Figure 6.2. <p> A related problem is: Given knowledge of the relative positions of a group of objects with respect to one frame of reference, can the relative positions of the objects be determined if the frame of reference is changed? Freksa <ref> [27] </ref> is actively pursuing solutions to this problem. 180 Mechanical Constraint Problems Recently, there has been much work in solving kinematics problems through qualitative reasoning [23, 36, 40].

Reference-contexts: Image databases are using retrieval techniques based on spatial models [8, 7, 52], and there are projects in natural language processing for producing natural language descriptions of a spatial scene [3, 39, 53, 77], and for visualizing a spatial scene based on natural language descriptions <ref> [29, 49, 56, 65] </ref>. <p> What is `far' is one context may be `near' in another. Recently, there has been much work in the development of quantitative methods for evaluating the applicability of various topological relations within a given context <ref> [1, 29, 56, 65] </ref>. Directional spatial relations, such as left-of and right-of, require a frame of reference. <p> CITYTOUR, as described in [77], uses rectangular bounding boxes aligned with the intrinsic fronts of objects, as illustrated in Figure 2.5. The goal of CITY-TOUR, along with other research that is part of the VITRA (VIsual TRAnslator) project, <ref> [3, 29, 53] </ref>, is to develop methods for qualitatively reasoning about visual descriptions of a spatial scene. Retz-Schmidt does not provide any qualitative model for the bounding abstractions that are used. <p> For example, what is `near' in one context may be considered as `far' in another. Much of the existing work in modeling these topological relations has focused on the development of quantitative techniques for measuring the applicability of these relations in a given context <ref> [1, 29, 49, 65] </ref>. The topological relations of primary interest in our work are those based on containment, since a magnetic field can only affect objects that are in the field. <p> Some related research issues include the generation of explanations using both text and graphical input [18], generating a pictorial description from a text description of a scene <ref> [29, 49, 65] </ref>, and generating a text description from a visual image of a scene [53]. The solutions to these issues focus less on associating pictorial objects with text objects, and instead, concentrate on the modeling and use of spatial relations. <p> The solutions to these issues focus less on associating pictorial objects with text objects, and instead, concentrate on the modeling and use of spatial relations. For example, Gapp <ref> [29] </ref>, Latecki and Pribbenow [49], and Olivier, et. al., [65] have all pointed out that the interpretation of distance-based topological relations, such as near and far, and those relating two paths, such as along, can be highly context dependent. <p> Two other types of topological relations are those that are dependent on distance, such as near and far, and those that are path-based, such as along. As argued by several researchers <ref> [49, 1, 29, 65] </ref>, the interpretation of these relations could be context-dependent. Therefore, quantitative analysis could be required to determine whether a given relation would apply to two objects. A combined qualitative-qualitative approach, such as that adopted by Brajnik [6], could prove to be useful in modeling these relations.

Since the graphical editor we use, the InterViews drawing editor, treats text as a separate object, we not use text labels in the Picture Semantics description. 82 In our approach, we first process the diagram before processing the text input. <p> Previous work in the area of integrating text and diagram input to a given problem solving system has resulted in the development of methods for automating the ability to understand text and diagrammatic input intended for human communication <ref> [32, 64, 80, 84] </ref>. <p> Just as we are making use of the Figure Understander to process diagram and text descriptions of the spatial reasoning problems used to test and evaluate this dissertation research, the work of Hari Narayanan, et al. [60] and He, et al. <ref> [32] </ref> could also benefit from the Picture Semantics-based approach for using diagrams and text as computer input. 99 Chapter 6 The Figure Understander - Implementation This chapter describes the implementation of the Figure Understander.

Reference-contexts: The previous work can be roughly divided into two categories: work toward the development of spatial models to support specific, complex real-world applications (e.g., [23, 53]), and work toward the development of formal, intuitive theories for qualitative spatial reasoning (e.g., <ref> [25, 33, 11] </ref>). The most powerful spatial models are associated with the former category, and allow reasoning about both static worlds and worlds where is translation and rotational motion. They allow reasoning about both the relative positions and orientation of objects, and can handle both 2 and 3-dimensional objects.

Reference-contexts: If simplifying abstract shapes (i.e., `idealizations' <ref> [35, 47] </ref>) are used to describe the bounds of objects, then it becomes easier to develop qualitative definitions of directional and topological spatial relations that take advantage of the simpler properties of the chosen abstract shapes. <p> For example, to determine whether a bird is in a tree, Herskovits <ref> [35] </ref> suggests that people may draw a circular boundary around the branches of the tree, and answer `yes' if most of the bird lies within the boundary. However, when idealizations are used, some precision is sacrificed, and conclusions may be reached that are not true of the underlying physical world. <p> Fortunately, there are many spatial reasoning problems which can be solved with only qualitative information about the spatial scene. Both Herskovits <ref> [35] </ref> and Landau and Jackendoff [47] have conducted extensive studies of human spatial reasoning that confirm that human models of spatial relations appear to depend mainly on the general boundedness, surface, or volumetric properties of an object.

Reference-contexts: Further, within the research area of Qualitative Reasoning [90, 43], the topic area of this dissertation, many spatial models have been proposed for performing a number of diverse tasks, including, but not limited to, the effects of kinematic constraints on objects in motion <ref> [14, 15, 23, 36, 40, 61] </ref>, modeling qualitative vector algebra [89], reasoning about the relative positions and orientation of objects in an urban scene [27, 50, 57], and reasoning about changes in spatial relations due to the translation motion of objects [11, 28], or due to changes in the size and <p> In such applications, simplying shape abstractions, such as a rectangle, can be used to approximate the space occupied by an object. If the problem domain is reasoning about the kinematic properties of objects, 2 such as whether two gears will mesh together <ref> [23, 36, 62] </ref>, then knowledge of the exact shapes and sizes of object is very important. To model the exact shapes and sizes of objects, a numerical model may be necessary. <p> When an application requires the positions of two multi-dimensional objects to be compared, if the model uses exact shapes, relations such as right-of and overlapped may need to be defined quantitatively, such as the Configuration Space-based 3 definitions used in much of the work on qualitative reasoning about mechanical con-straints <ref> [14, 15, 23, 36, 62] </ref>. If simplifying abstract shapes (i.e., `idealizations' [35, 47]) are used to describe the bounds of objects, then it becomes easier to develop qualitative definitions of directional and topological spatial relations that take advantage of the simpler properties of the chosen abstract shapes. <p> If a problem requires reasoning about the exact shapes of objects, such as whether two gears will mesh together, a solution approach which combines qualitative and quantitative reasoning, like the methods developed for reasoning about the qualitative features of a configuration space representation <ref> [23, 36] </ref>, will be required.

Reference-contexts: While this approach is 31 quite appropriate for navigation and route finding, queries about the areas of overlap between objects, or the intrinsic fronts of objects, are inexpressible. Rectangular bounding boxes and bounding cubes are a commonly used shape abstraction method for multi-dimensional objects <ref> [1, 8, 37, 53, 57, 77] </ref>. Other shape abstractions which have been used include convex hulls [11], and symbolic arrays [30]. For our purposes, convex hulls are inappropriate since they require quantitative knowledge of the shapes of objects to describe and maintain. <p> In the models that use them, the criteria for drawing rectangular shape abstractions vary greatly. Chang [8], Jungert <ref> [37] </ref>, and Maass [53] draw a minimum bounding rectangle or cube around each object based on an extrinsic Cartesian coordinate system.

Reference-contexts: We have developed a new representation for qualitative spatial reasoning which incorporates many of the ideas in previous work for reasoning about the spatial extent, relative position, and orientation of objects, and yet, is compatible with existing methods <ref> [9, 17, 20, 42] </ref> for qualitative modeling and simulation of physical systems.

Reference-contexts: The use of diagrams to describe the spatial scene serves two purposes. One is convenience. We extract a lot of spatial information from a diagram, and as the popular saying goes, `a picture can be worth a thousand words' <ref> [48] </ref>. The second is to meet a necessity. As described in the previous section, it is sometimes necessary 15 to rotate the frame of reference of the input scene to maximize the number of vectors and edges of objects that are aligned with the coordinate axes. <p> More generally, Larkin and Simon describe the benefits of using both diagrams and text to describe a scene in their classic paper, "Why a Diagram is (Sometimes) Worth 10,000 Words" <ref> [48] </ref>. Pictures can be used to compactly describe the spatial properties of objects in a scene. This allows any accompanying textual descriptions to concentrate on the non-spatial domain-specific and problem-specific (henceforth, contextual) properties of objects. <p> Our Approach for Solving the Coreference Problem The Figure Understander addresses the question "Are there any simple, but unre-strictive, methods that allow diagrams and text to be used as computer input?". The goal is to take advantage of the power of diagrams for describing the spatial state <ref> [48, 60] </ref> and yet retain the ability to use text-based input to describe other contextual properties of interest. We have developed a novel solution to the coreference problem based on two observations: (1) Annotations are often used in drawings to allow human readers to associate non-spatial contextual information with objects. <p> The goal is to take advantage of the power of diagrams for describing a spatial state <ref> [48, 60] </ref> and yet retain the ability to use text-based input to describe other contextual properties of interest.

Reference-contexts: Image databases are using retrieval techniques based on spatial models [8, 7, 52], and there are projects in natural language processing for producing natural language descriptions of a spatial scene [3, 39, 53, 77], and for visualizing a spatial scene based on natural language descriptions <ref> [29, 49, 56, 65] </ref>. <p> For example, what is `near' in one context may be considered as `far' in another. Much of the existing work in modeling these topological relations has focused on the development of quantitative techniques for measuring the applicability of these relations in a given context <ref> [1, 29, 49, 65] </ref>. The topological relations of primary interest in our work are those based on containment, since a magnetic field can only affect objects that are in the field. <p> Some related research issues include the generation of explanations using both text and graphical input [18], generating a pictorial description from a text description of a scene <ref> [29, 49, 65] </ref>, and generating a text description from a visual image of a scene [53]. The solutions to these issues focus less on associating pictorial objects with text objects, and instead, concentrate on the modeling and use of spatial relations. <p> The solutions to these issues focus less on associating pictorial objects with text objects, and instead, concentrate on the modeling and use of spatial relations. For example, Gapp [29], Latecki and Pribbenow <ref> [49] </ref>, and Olivier, et. al., [65] have all pointed out that the interpretation of distance-based topological relations, such as near and far, and those relating two paths, such as along, can be highly context dependent. <p> Two other types of topological relations are those that are dependent on distance, such as near and far, and those that are path-based, such as along. As argued by several researchers <ref> [49, 1, 29, 65] </ref>, the interpretation of these relations could be context-dependent. Therefore, quantitative analysis could be required to determine whether a given relation would apply to two objects. A combined qualitative-qualitative approach, such as that adopted by Brajnik [6], could prove to be useful in modeling these relations. <p> Two other subareas that could benefit from our approach to spatial reasoning are (a) producing natural language descriptions of a visual scene [77, 53], and (b) visualizing a natural language description of a spatial scene <ref> [49, 65] </ref>. For example, in the latter case, a system of qualitative inequality constraints could 181 be generated based on the use of spatial relations in text input. The problem of positioning the objects could be solved as a constraint satisfaction problem.

The drawback is that these models require quantitative descriptions of the spatial scene, such as a video image <ref> [53] </ref> or a configuration space representation [23]. The models in the second class have the advantage of being both intuitive and elegant, but each of these qualitative models addresses only a small subset of the many spatial reasoning issues. <p> While this approach is 31 quite appropriate for navigation and route finding, queries about the areas of overlap between objects, or the intrinsic fronts of objects, are inexpressible. Rectangular bounding boxes and bounding cubes are a commonly used shape abstraction method for multi-dimensional objects <ref> [1, 8, 37, 53, 57, 77] </ref>. Other shape abstractions which have been used include convex hulls [11], and symbolic arrays [30]. For our purposes, convex hulls are inappropriate since they require quantitative knowledge of the shapes of objects to describe and maintain. <p> In the models that use them, the criteria for drawing rectangular shape abstractions vary greatly. Chang [8], Jungert [37], and Maass <ref> [53] </ref> draw a minimum bounding rectangle or cube around each object based on an extrinsic Cartesian coordinate system. Chang and Jungert exploit the same properties of minimum bounding rectangles that we do. <p> CITYTOUR, as described in [77], uses rectangular bounding boxes aligned with the intrinsic fronts of objects, as illustrated in Figure 2.5. The goal of CITY-TOUR, along with other research that is part of the VITRA (VIsual TRAnslator) project, <ref> [3, 29, 53] </ref>, is to develop methods for qualitatively reasoning about visual descriptions of a spatial scene. Retz-Schmidt does not provide any qualitative model for the bounding abstractions that are used. <p> Some related research issues include the generation of explanations using both text and graphical input [18], generating a pictorial description from a text description of a scene [29, 49, 65], and generating a text description from a visual image of a scene <ref> [53] </ref>. The solutions to these issues focus less on associating pictorial objects with text objects, and instead, concentrate on the modeling and use of spatial relations. <p> Our work on integrating text and diagram input is only one application area for qualitative spatial reasoning within the larger field of natural language processing. Two other subareas that could benefit from our approach to spatial reasoning are (a) producing natural language descriptions of a visual scene <ref> [77, 53] </ref>, and (b) visualizing a natural language description of a spatial scene [49, 65]. For example, in the latter case, a system of qualitative inequality constraints could 181 be generated based on the use of spatial relations in text input.

Reference-contexts: spatial models have been proposed for performing a number of diverse tasks, including, but not limited to, the effects of kinematic constraints on objects in motion [14, 15, 23, 36, 40, 61], modeling qualitative vector algebra [89], reasoning about the relative positions and orientation of objects in an urban scene <ref> [27, 50, 57] </ref>, and reasoning about changes in spatial relations due to the translation motion of objects [11, 28], or due to changes in the size and shape of objects [13]. 1 1.2 Properties of Spatial Models All of the tools mentioned above make use of spatial models to accomplish their <p> Hadzilacos and Tryfona [31] also assume that knowledge of the boundaries of objects is available, without providing a method for modeling these boundaries. Another example is the collision parallelogram representation of Mukerjee and Joe <ref> [57] </ref>. Projections called lines of travel are drawn parallel to the surface normal direction of the intrinsic front of an object. When the lines of travel of two objects intersect, they form a parallelogram. <p> While this approach is 31 quite appropriate for navigation and route finding, queries about the areas of overlap between objects, or the intrinsic fronts of objects, are inexpressible. Rectangular bounding boxes and bounding cubes are a commonly used shape abstraction method for multi-dimensional objects <ref> [1, 8, 37, 53, 57, 77] </ref>. Other shape abstractions which have been used include convex hulls [11], and symbolic arrays [30]. For our purposes, convex hulls are inappropriate since they require quantitative knowledge of the shapes of objects to describe and maintain. <p> Retz-Schmidt does not provide any qualitative model for the bounding abstractions that are used. Instead, with the availability of precise, metric information, any bounding shapes and any spatial relationships with other objects are simply computed numerically on an as-needed basis. Mukerjee and Joe <ref> [57, 58] </ref> also draw bounding rectangles around the intrinsic fronts of objects. <p> This appears to be complex and difficult to maintain, particularly if objects are allowed to freely translate and rotate. Unfortunately, Mukerjee and Joe <ref> [57, 58] </ref> do not provide an implementation of their model. <p> An example Algernon rule, which translates queries on ahead-of to queries on above, is given in Figure 3.6. Support for Reasoning with Intrinsic Frames of Reference As noted by Mukerjee and Joe <ref> [57] </ref> and Retz-Schmidt [77], in some applications, it may be necessary to reason about directional relations between objects in terms of an intrinsic or deictic frame of reference. <p> However, Cui, Cohn, and Randell rely on an external quantitative function to compute the convex hulls of objects. When only qualitative descriptions of the spatial state are available, it may not be possible to compute the convex hull of an object. Further, Mukerjee and Joe <ref> [57, 58] </ref> argue that rectangular bounding boxes drawn around the intrinsic front of an object may better approximate the spatial extent of the object than bounding boxes drawn based on an arbitrary extrinsic frame of reference.

Reference-contexts: Retz-Schmidt does not provide any qualitative model for the bounding abstractions that are used. Instead, with the availability of precise, metric information, any bounding shapes and any spatial relationships with other objects are simply computed numerically on an as-needed basis. Mukerjee and Joe <ref> [57, 58] </ref> also draw bounding rectangles around the intrinsic fronts of objects. <p> They cite that for problems involving reasoning with the intrinsic frames of reference of objects, minimum bounding rectangles drawn around the intrinsic front of an object may provide a `tighter' abstract shape than a bounding rectangle based on an arbitrary extrinsic coordinate system. Mukerjee and Joe's <ref> [58] </ref> spatial representation is based on the concept of `collision parallelograms', as illustrated in Figure 2.6. In their representation, projections are drawn based on the front direction of each bounding rectangle. Whenever two sets of projections meet, a collision parallelogram is formed. <p> This appears to be complex and difficult to maintain, particularly if objects are allowed to freely translate and rotate. Unfortunately, Mukerjee and Joe <ref> [57, 58] </ref> do not provide an implementation of their model. <p> As in Chapter 3, all references to an extrinsic, Cartesian coordinate should be interpreted to mean the final extrinsic coordinate system which has been chosen for the problem. 4.1 Modeling the Orientation of Surfaces of Objects As discussed by Freksa [27], Mukerjee and Joe <ref> [58] </ref>, and Nielsen [62], for a 2-dimensional object confined to the X-Y plane, there are 8 qualitative orientations for any surface of an object. These are shown in Figure 4.1. <p> For any surface which lies between the leftmost and topmost vertices or edges, the orientation vector is (-1 1). 63 4.1.1 Modeling Surface Tangent Directions Knowledge of the surface normal direction of a surface is sufficient for such applications as modeling the intrinsic or deictic front direction of an object <ref> [27, 58] </ref>. For modeling such properties as the direction of current flow along a surface of a conducting object, or to model the direction of a frictional force acting on an object [62], we need the surface tangent direction of each surface of interest. <p> However, Cui, Cohn, and Randell rely on an external quantitative function to compute the convex hulls of objects. When only qualitative descriptions of the spatial state are available, it may not be possible to compute the convex hull of an object. Further, Mukerjee and Joe <ref> [57, 58] </ref> argue that rectangular bounding boxes drawn around the intrinsic front of an object may better approximate the spatial extent of the object than bounding boxes drawn based on an arbitrary extrinsic frame of reference.

Reference-contexts: Our Approach for Solving the Coreference Problem The Figure Understander addresses the question "Are there any simple, but unre-strictive, methods that allow diagrams and text to be used as computer input?". The goal is to take advantage of the power of diagrams for describing the spatial state <ref> [48, 60] </ref> and yet retain the ability to use text-based input to describe other contextual properties of interest. We have developed a novel solution to the coreference problem based on two observations: (1) Annotations are often used in drawings to allow human readers to associate non-spatial contextual information with objects. <p> The goal is to take advantage of the power of diagrams for describing a spatial state <ref> [48, 60] </ref> and yet retain the ability to use text-based input to describe other contextual properties of interest. <p> Just as we are making use of the Figure Understander to process diagram and text descriptions of the spatial reasoning problems used to test and evaluate this dissertation research, the work of Hari Narayanan, et al. <ref> [60] </ref> and He, et al. [32] could also benefit from the Picture Semantics-based approach for using diagrams and text as computer input. 99 Chapter 6 The Figure Understander - Implementation This chapter describes the implementation of the Figure Understander.

Reference-contexts: Further, within the research area of Qualitative Reasoning [90, 43], the topic area of this dissertation, many spatial models have been proposed for performing a number of diverse tasks, including, but not limited to, the effects of kinematic constraints on objects in motion <ref> [14, 15, 23, 36, 40, 61] </ref>, modeling qualitative vector algebra [89], reasoning about the relative positions and orientation of objects in an urban scene [27, 50, 57], and reasoning about changes in spatial relations due to the translation motion of objects [11, 28], or due to changes in the size and <p> In addition to these basic features, our spatial model provides the following additional capabilities. First, we have implemented methods for reasoning about vectors and vector operations. Previously, Weinberg, et. al. [89] and Nielsen <ref> [61, 62] </ref> have both described techniques for reasoning about vectors. Our work extends their contributions by providing the ability to qualitatively perform the vector cross product operation. <p> For example, shape abstraction cannot be used to reason about either mechanical constraint problems, as considered in <ref> [61] </ref>, or to reason about the direction of current flow at a given point on the surface of a conductor. <p> Further, we cannot model the possibility of contact between specific surfaces of objects, or the extent of such contact. This would be required, for example, in reasoning about kinematics problems, as studied by Nielsen <ref> [61, 62] </ref>. <p> However, we do provide some support to allow the ability to reason about mechanical constraint issues to be added in future releases of the Motion Under-stander. For example, when processing a diagram, we automatically extract much 143 of the information used by Nielsen <ref> [61, 62] </ref> in his work on reasoning about mechan-ical constraint problems. <p> Other properties true of the magnetic fields domain that are not compatible with the use of Configuration Spaces are that objects can have infinite spatial extent (e.g., the magnetic field around a current carrying conductor), and that spatial objects can be dynamically created and destroyed. Nielsen <ref> [61] </ref> presents several qualitative methods for reasoning about mechanical constraints. The diagram processing capabilities of the Figure Understander include the ability to extract several of the spatial properties of objects used by Nielsen.

Reference-contexts: In such applications, simplying shape abstractions, such as a rectangle, can be used to approximate the space occupied by an object. If the problem domain is reasoning about the kinematic properties of objects, 2 such as whether two gears will mesh together <ref> [23, 36, 62] </ref>, then knowledge of the exact shapes and sizes of object is very important. To model the exact shapes and sizes of objects, a numerical model may be necessary. <p> When an application requires the positions of two multi-dimensional objects to be compared, if the model uses exact shapes, relations such as right-of and overlapped may need to be defined quantitatively, such as the Configuration Space-based 3 definitions used in much of the work on qualitative reasoning about mechanical con-straints <ref> [14, 15, 23, 36, 62] </ref>. If simplifying abstract shapes (i.e., `idealizations' [35, 47]) are used to describe the bounds of objects, then it becomes easier to develop qualitative definitions of directional and topological spatial relations that take advantage of the simpler properties of the chosen abstract shapes. <p> In addition to these basic features, our spatial model provides the following additional capabilities. First, we have implemented methods for reasoning about vectors and vector operations. Previously, Weinberg, et. al. [89] and Nielsen <ref> [61, 62] </ref> have both described techniques for reasoning about vectors. Our work extends their contributions by providing the ability to qualitatively perform the vector cross product operation. <p> This simplifies the problem by aligning all vectors of interest with the coordinate axes. Our heuristics give priority to immobile objects and permanent vectors since their orientation will remain fixed for the problem to be solved. This complements the work of Nielsen <ref> [62] </ref> who suggests similar heuristics, but does not appear to have tested the ideas through an implementation. <p> Further, we cannot model the possibility of contact between specific surfaces of objects, or the extent of such contact. This would be required, for example, in reasoning about kinematics problems, as studied by Nielsen <ref> [61, 62] </ref>. <p> As in Chapter 3, all references to an extrinsic, Cartesian coordinate should be interpreted to mean the final extrinsic coordinate system which has been chosen for the problem. 4.1 Modeling the Orientation of Surfaces of Objects As discussed by Freksa [27], Mukerjee and Joe [58], and Nielsen <ref> [62] </ref>, for a 2-dimensional object confined to the X-Y plane, there are 8 qualitative orientations for any surface of an object. These are shown in Figure 4.1. <p> For modeling such properties as the direction of current flow along a surface of a conducting object, or to model the direction of a frictional force acting on an object <ref> [62] </ref>, we need the surface tangent direction of each surface of interest. For objects in the X-Y plane, the surface tangent direction, in the clockwise direction as viewed from positive infinity on the Z-axis, can be obtained from knowledge of the surface normal direction as described below. <p> However, we do provide some support to allow the ability to reason about mechanical constraint issues to be added in future releases of the Motion Under-stander. For example, when processing a diagram, we automatically extract much 143 of the information used by Nielsen <ref> [61, 62] </ref> in his work on reasoning about mechan-ical constraint problems.

The answer is yes, if, as with the work of Srihari [84], Rowe [80], and Novak <ref> [64] </ref>, the goal is to automatically process text and diagram input intended for human use, such a problem statement in a textbook, or a newspaper photograph. That is why their solutions to the coreference problem are necessarily more complex.

Reference-contexts: Image databases are using retrieval techniques based on spatial models [8, 7, 52], and there are projects in natural language processing for producing natural language descriptions of a spatial scene [3, 39, 53, 77], and for visualizing a spatial scene based on natural language descriptions <ref> [29, 49, 56, 65] </ref>. <p> What is `far' is one context may be `near' in another. Recently, there has been much work in the development of quantitative methods for evaluating the applicability of various topological relations within a given context <ref> [1, 29, 56, 65] </ref>. Directional spatial relations, such as left-of and right-of, require a frame of reference. <p> For example, what is `near' in one context may be considered as `far' in another. Much of the existing work in modeling these topological relations has focused on the development of quantitative techniques for measuring the applicability of these relations in a given context <ref> [1, 29, 49, 65] </ref>. The topological relations of primary interest in our work are those based on containment, since a magnetic field can only affect objects that are in the field. <p> Some related research issues include the generation of explanations using both text and graphical input [18], generating a pictorial description from a text description of a scene <ref> [29, 49, 65] </ref>, and generating a text description from a visual image of a scene [53]. The solutions to these issues focus less on associating pictorial objects with text objects, and instead, concentrate on the modeling and use of spatial relations. <p> The solutions to these issues focus less on associating pictorial objects with text objects, and instead, concentrate on the modeling and use of spatial relations. For example, Gapp [29], Latecki and Pribbenow [49], and Olivier, et. al., <ref> [65] </ref> have all pointed out that the interpretation of distance-based topological relations, such as near and far, and those relating two paths, such as along, can be highly context dependent. <p> Two other types of topological relations are those that are dependent on distance, such as near and far, and those that are path-based, such as along. As argued by several researchers <ref> [49, 1, 29, 65] </ref>, the interpretation of these relations could be context-dependent. Therefore, quantitative analysis could be required to determine whether a given relation would apply to two objects. A combined qualitative-qualitative approach, such as that adopted by Brajnik [6], could prove to be useful in modeling these relations. <p> Two other subareas that could benefit from our approach to spatial reasoning are (a) producing natural language descriptions of a visual scene [77, 53], and (b) visualizing a natural language description of a spatial scene <ref> [49, 65] </ref>. For example, in the latter case, a system of qualitative inequality constraints could 181 be generated based on the use of spatial relations in text input. The problem of positioning the objects could be solved as a constraint satisfaction problem.

Reference-contexts: Whereas rotating a diagram numerically is a well understood procedure, rotating a diagram starting with a qualitative description is non-trivial and is likely to yield many ambiguities <ref> [67] </ref>. We found that although some general qualitative solutions exist, these solutions require specialized information about the scene that is unlikely to be available unless a diagram is also available. Therefore, we have opted to numerically rotate the diagram when necessary.

Reference-contexts: For other problems, the goal may be prove a general result about the behavior of a class of objects. For example, many textbooks problems <ref> [76] </ref>, such as the one described in Figure 1.1, test the student's understanding of a concept based on idealized cases. In Figure 1.1, for example, none of the objects in the example have a complex shape. <p> More specifically, our methods have been applied to solve qualitative textbook problems <ref> [76] </ref> from the magnetic fields domain [68, 75, 71], and to solve problems in understanding natural language descriptions of an urban scene [70, 73]. <p> You roll a copper disk down the track. Describe the motion of the disk as it rolls from the top of the track to the bottom. of Physics <ref> [76] </ref>. For example, Figure 1.1 describes a magnetic fields problem where the reader is asked to describe what happens as a conducting disk rolls down a track into a magnetic field which is pointed into the page. <p> We observe that such approximations are also appropriate for many problems involving qualitative reasoning about the physical world. For example, to focus as closely as possible on the basic principles to be taught, Physics texts such as Resnick and Halliday's Fundamentals of Physics <ref> [76] </ref> often use examples where the objects in the scene have idealized, simple shapes, such as the problem described in Figure 1.1. <p> Figure 5.1 redisplays the diagram and text statement for the Physics problem <ref> [76] </ref> introduced in Chapter 1. The diagram objects are lines, polygons, and circles. The text problem statement uses domain-specific terms, such as `disk' and `track', to describe the same objects. Each form of input, diagram and text, contains unique information. <p> The example is similar to the problem from Resnick and Halliday's Physics textbook <ref> [76] </ref>, as shown in Figure 8.1. The input we gave to the Figure Understander for this problem is shown in Figure 8.2. <p> The diagram also 130 * Diagram: * Text: The resistance R in the left-hand circuit of Fig. 20 is being increased at a steady rate. What is the di rection of the induced current in the right-hand circuit? Physics text, Fundamentals of Physics <ref> [76] </ref>. shows a passive conducting loop, labeled l1, which is disconnected from the active loop. The magnitude of the current flow in the active conducting loop is decreasing due to increasing resistance in the loop. <p> In our magnetic fields domain model, we provide the knowledge that for a closed conducting object, the field generated by current flow will have one direction within the object, and the opposite direction outside the object. The direction of current flow is given by the right hand rule <ref> [76] </ref>, as stated below: Right Hand Rule: Grasp a conductor with the right hand with the thumb pointing in the direction of current flow. The fingers will curl around the conductor in the direction of B, the magnetic field. <p> Some other applications areas are intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) and natural language processing (NLP) systems.

As in textbooks <ref> [76] </ref>, an ITS may benefit from the ability to explain a concept, or test the student's basic understanding of a concept, through a qualitative example. <p> The corresponding diagram from Resnick and Halliday's physics text <ref> [76] </ref> is shown in Figure A.2.

Reference-contexts: Unmanned robots can make use of specialized mapping techniques to explore unknown environments [12, 45, 46]. Image databases are using retrieval techniques based on spatial models [8, 7, 52], and there are projects in natural language processing for producing natural language descriptions of a spatial scene <ref> [3, 39, 53, 77] </ref>, and for visualizing a spatial scene based on natural language descriptions [29, 49, 56, 65]. <p> An automated tour guide requires a multi-dimensional model of objects so that their relative sizes can be taken into account in generating a description. As Retz-Schmidt points out in <ref> [77] </ref>, while the description `The bicycle is in front of the church' is generally an acceptable statement, the alternate description `The church is behind the bicycle' is usually not acceptable. <p> Some applications, particularly those involving natural language processing <ref> [77] </ref>, may require the capability to switch arbitrarily between different frames of reference. In addition to the frame of reference, another important factor in modeling the relative position of objects is the basis of the comparison. <p> In describing the CITYTOUR system, Retz-Schmidt <ref> [77] </ref> describes an algo 5 rithm for reasoning about directional spatial relations between a primary object and a reference object based on the intrinsic or deictic frames of reference provided by the reference object. <p> While this approach is 31 quite appropriate for navigation and route finding, queries about the areas of overlap between objects, or the intrinsic fronts of objects, are inexpressible. Rectangular bounding boxes and bounding cubes are a commonly used shape abstraction method for multi-dimensional objects <ref> [1, 8, 37, 53, 57, 77] </ref>. Other shape abstractions which have been used include convex hulls [11], and symbolic arrays [30]. For our purposes, convex hulls are inappropriate since they require quantitative knowledge of the shapes of objects to describe and maintain. <p> This method is inappropriate for our use since the definitions used are quantitative, the abstractions don't meet our adequacy criterion, and only static scenes are considered. CITYTOUR, as described in <ref> [77] </ref>, uses rectangular bounding boxes aligned with the intrinsic fronts of objects, as illustrated in Figure 2.5. <p> An example Algernon rule, which translates queries on ahead-of to queries on above, is given in Figure 3.6. Support for Reasoning with Intrinsic Frames of Reference As noted by Mukerjee and Joe [57] and Retz-Schmidt <ref> [77] </ref>, in some applications, it may be necessary to reason about directional relations between objects in terms of an intrinsic or deictic frame of reference. <p> word `my' refers to the speaker, locate the only speaker (O) in the diagram, and then use the spatial relation `building strictly to the right of the speaker' to locate the only building (B2) that satisfies the relation and label that as `Welch Hall'. 5.5.1 Intrinsic/Deictic Frames of Reference Retz-Schmidt <ref> [77] </ref> discusses that in human use of spatial prepositions, extrinsic, intrinsic, or deictic frames of reference could be used. The Figure Understander enforces the convention that all objects of interest are mentioned explicitly in the text sentences. <p> Our work on integrating text and diagram input is only one application area for qualitative spatial reasoning within the larger field of natural language processing. Two other subareas that could benefit from our approach to spatial reasoning are (a) producing natural language descriptions of a visual scene <ref> [77, 53] </ref>, and (b) visualizing a natural language description of a spatial scene [49, 65]. For example, in the latter case, a system of qualitative inequality constraints could 181 be generated based on the use of spatial relations in text input.

Reference-contexts: Further, as this work has been performed within a larger effort to develop techniques for qualitative modeling and simulation of real world phenomena <ref> [17, 26, 38, 43, 44, 78] </ref>, two other needs arise: to develop a spatial 6 model that supports integrated reasoning about simultaneous dynamic change in both the spatial and non-spatial properties of a given system, and to develop a model which guarantees that all real behaviors achievable from an initial state

Reference-contexts: research area of Qualitative Reasoning [90, 43], the topic area of this dissertation, many spatial models have been proposed for performing a number of diverse tasks, including, but not limited to, the effects of kinematic constraints on objects in motion [14, 15, 23, 36, 40, 61], modeling qualitative vector algebra <ref> [89] </ref>, reasoning about the relative positions and orientation of objects in an urban scene [27, 50, 57], and reasoning about changes in spatial relations due to the translation motion of objects [11, 28], or due to changes in the size and shape of objects [13]. 1 1.2 Properties of Spatial Models <p> In addition to these basic features, our spatial model provides the following additional capabilities. First, we have implemented methods for reasoning about vectors and vector operations. Previously, Weinberg, et. al. <ref> [89] </ref> and Nielsen [61, 62] have both described techniques for reasoning about vectors. Our work extends their contributions by providing the ability to qualitatively perform the vector cross product operation. <p> A zero value is allowed because the X component of the magnetic force vector could be decreasing, and thus, net-mag-force-x could become zero at the end of the simulation of the spatial state. 4.3.2 The Qualitative Vector Cross Product Operation Weinberg, et. al. <ref> [89] </ref> present a model of qualitative vector algebra which covers the vector addition, substration, and dot product operations. In our work, we extend their results to cover the vector cross product operation.
