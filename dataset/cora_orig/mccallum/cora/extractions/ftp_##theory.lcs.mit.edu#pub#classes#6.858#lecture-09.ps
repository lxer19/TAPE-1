Abstract: The major result we have seen so far is the relationship between VC-dimension and PAC-learning. It turns out that finite VC-dimension enables PAC- learnability. Finite VC-dimension is used in other areas, such as computational geometry. We are moving away from PAC learning to learning in a more general sense. The objective is to find a relationship between observed error rate for a sample and the true error rate. We hope that picking a concept c with a small observed error rate gives us small true error rate. 1 positive example D = some unknown distribution on X from which we draw labelled examples. As in the PAC learning framework we attempt to learn the target concept c fl . However, we do not guarantee that c belongs to C and we may not be able to come up with a perfect target concept. Our goal is to minimize the error rate.

Reference-contexts: Estimating Error in Case of Many Concepts Now the objective is to estimate many biased coins simultaneously. The question is whether we can estimate all D m ~c simultaneously. Example: X = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is a unit interval D = uniform distribution C = set of all concepts on [0, 1] When many concepts converge simultaneously the estimate for one concept does not give the estimate for all (see figure 9.1). <p> Estimating Error in Case of Many Concepts Now the objective is to estimate many biased coins simultaneously.
