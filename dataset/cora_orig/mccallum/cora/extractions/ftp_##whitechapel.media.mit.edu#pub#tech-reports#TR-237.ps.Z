Title: new Wold ordering for image similarity  
Author: Rosalind W. Picard and Fang Liu 
Note: A  
Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 237 Appeared: IEEE ICASSP Adelaide, Apr. 1994, V:129-132 Abstract The problem of measuring perceptual similarity between images is addressed using a new image model based on the Wold decomposition. The model permits separate treatment of image components which correspond approximately to periodicity, directionality, and randomness. We compare its performance in an image search application to two other methods one based on shift-invariant principle components and one based on a multiscale simultaneous auto-regressive model. When textured images are ordered by distances between their Wold components, the results appear to be much closer to the human perception of similarity. We discuss how decoupling the three components can increase flexibility for measuring image similarity and can save computation, permitting the "quickest" matches when the features are the most perceptually "salient."

Reference-contexts: The work of Francos et. al. did not attempt to apply this model to inhomogeneous data, nor is their implementation designed to be applied to such data <ref> [5] </ref>. This paper addresses the problem of adapting the model for use in natural texture data. In addition to its significance in random field theory, we have found that the Wold-based model has an interesting relationship to independent psychophysical findings of perceptual similarity.

Reference-contexts: In addition to its significance in random field theory, we have found that the Wold-based model has an interesting relationship to independent psychophysical findings of perceptual similarity. Noteworthy is a recent study by Rao and Lohse where humans grouped patterns according to perceived similarity <ref> [6] </ref>. The three orthogonal dimensions identified were repetitiveness, directionality, and complexity. These dimensions might be considered the perceptual equivalents of the harmonic, evanescent, and indeterministic components in the Wold-based model. 2 New Wold implementation The new model implementation consists of three stages.

A benchmark comparison of these two models was recently conducted [11], where the SAR model outperformed the principal components using traditional pattern recognition criteria. However, in "playing with the system" we found that the principal components were more useful than the SAR for navigating through the database.

Reference-contexts: same number of main orientations are compared by examining the Mahalanobis distances between their SAR parameters. 3 Similarity experiments In this section we illustrate the performance of the new Wold model on the Brodatz database, which consists of 1008 texture patches cropped from all 112 images in the Brodatz Album <ref> [9] </ref>. Each Brodatz texture provides nine non-overlapping 8-bit 128 fi 128 subimages. This collection of natural textures exhibits large variety, including many inhomogeneous patterns; therefore, it provides a challenge 2 to traditionally homogeneous image models.
