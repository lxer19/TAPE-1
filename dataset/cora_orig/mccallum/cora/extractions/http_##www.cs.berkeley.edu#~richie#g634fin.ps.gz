Abstract: The task of object recognition in image processing and machine vision problems relies on finding good algorithms for one particular low-level processing task: image segmentation. In this report, we apply the concept of fractal dimension to this problem. In particular, we introduce the notion of a local fractal operator that can "measure" the fractal dimension of a single pixel; we investigate three simple examples of such operators. We then use histograms of the computed fractal dimensions of all the pixels to recolor the image in bins; the result is the segmented image. We illustrate the use of our methods on several images and discuss the various shortcomings of the technique. For an image of m 2 pixels, we show that our basic algorithm with operators can execute in O(m 2 ) steps, which is faster than traditional approaches using transform methods which are O fi

Reference-contexts: Elementary textbook examples of fractals, such as the Sierpinski triangle shown in fig. 2, are generated by iterating some procedure. The geometry of such a structure is said to be self-similar in part because as we zoom in we see the same structure repeated, regardless of scale. Mandelbrot <ref> [2] </ref> first quantified such structure and observed its presence in natural objects such as trees, mountain ridges, etc. Moreover, we can quantify such structure by various measures, the most commonly known one being fractal dimension (FD).

This will be briefly mentioned later in the Introduction. 3 It has been noted that the range of "*-values" varies widely (see Turcotte <ref> [3] </ref>); in particular, we note that for images * is the size of one pixel (see Implementation for more remarks on pixels and intensity values). 4 the measurement of a coastline by continually laying finer grids atop it and counting the number of grid-squares which containing the coast.

Reference-contexts: In the implementation section, we will describe how we extended this idea to images using three different techniques. There are alternative techniques for computing fractal dimension. For instance, time-series analyses feature spectral analysis and the Fourier transform. Pentland <ref> [4] </ref> performed extensive testing on using fractal dimension to segment images. To compute the fractal dimension, he used the fast Fourier transform on the image, treating rows/columns as "series." The theoretical basis for this method of measuring fractal dimension is based on analyses of Brownian motion.

Reference-contexts: we restrict ourselves to a fixed number of values of r to evaluate, and since the size of the window W is fixed, the number of computations is fixed and thus requires O (1) operations 8 . 2.3 Sarkar's method Next, we consider a variation due to Sarkar and Chaudhuri <ref> [5] </ref>. Again, we consider the FD of a pixel (i; j) by looking at its local m fi m-pixel window W . * for various r 2 (0; 1] do 1. Divide W into r squares 2. <p> Again, similar arguments apply w.r.t. to running time of this fragment; thus, the execution time remains O (n 2 ). We should point out that we have selected Sarkar's algorithm in part because, according to the results of his paper <ref> [5] </ref>, his method covers a wide dynamic range of FD values. Specifically, he compared his method with several other FD approximations on various test images of known FD ranging from D = 2 to D = 3.
