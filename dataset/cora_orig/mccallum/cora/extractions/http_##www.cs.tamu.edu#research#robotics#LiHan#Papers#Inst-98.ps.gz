Title: The Instantaneous Kinematics of Manipulation

Abstract: Dextrous manipulation planning is a problem of paramount importance in the study of multifingered robotic hands. In this paper, we show in general, that all system variables (the finger joint, object,and contact velocities) need to be included in the differential kinematic equation used for manipulation planning, even if the manipulation task is only specified in terms of the goal configuration of the object or the contacts only. The dextrous manipulation kinematics that relates the finger joint movements to object and contact movements is derived. With the results of inverse and forward instantaneous kinematics, we precisely formulate the problem of dextrous manipulation and cast it in a form suitable for integrating the relevant theory of contact kinematics, nonholonomic motion planning, and grasp stability to develop a general technique for dextrous manipulation planning with multifingered hands.

Reference-contexts: The current theory will be generalized to incorporate issues like workspace limits of hands,uncertainty and dynamic constraints. We are currently applying the analysis methods presented in paper <ref> [1] </ref> to study various properties of dextrous manipulation. While the instantaneous kinematics reveals the kinematic constraints clearly and is informative for local motion planning, we still need a representation of configuration space of the hand-object system and global motion planning techniques to enable us to implement automatic dextrous manipulation planning.

Reference-contexts: We have applied this methodology in the manipulation planning to two special but important manipulation cases: one flat finger rolling a ball on a plane and two flat fingertips manipulating a ball. The experimental results are reported in paper <ref> [3] </ref>. One particular point to notice is that a grasp is characterized by the contact points on the object fff o i ; i = 1:::mg and _ff o i can be used as the generalized contact coordinate velocity for pure rolling contacts as indicated by equation (3).

Reference-contexts: Thus the corresponding velocities should appear in the kinematic equations used for planning. In this paper, we derive in detail the instantaneous manipulation kinematics relating object and contact movement to finger joint movement, by incorporating closed kinematic chain constraints <ref> [8] </ref> and the physical constraints imposed by the contact models (e.g. sliding, rolling etc). The kinematic equation reveals the constraints on the feasible velocities of the finger joints, the object, and the contact points to maintain a grasp with a given contact mode.
