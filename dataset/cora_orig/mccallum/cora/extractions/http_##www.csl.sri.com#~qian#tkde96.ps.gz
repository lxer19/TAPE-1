Abstract: We develop a formal framework of MAC policies in multilevel relational databases. We identify the important components of MAC policies and their desirable properties. The framework provides a basis for systematically specifying MAC policies and characterizing their potential mismatches. Based on the framework, we compare and unify the MAC policies and policy components that are proposed in the literature or imposed in existing systems. Our framework could be used to capture and resolve MAC policy mismatches in the trusted interoperation of heterogeneous multilevel relational databases.

Reference-contexts: The maintenance level of LDV [7] and the data-based semantics of MLR <ref> [2] </ref> generalize the belief-based semantics, by allowing users to specify, for every tuple at a level, at which higher levels it is believed. When the view policy for a tuple is missing, the default coincides with the belief-based semantics.

Reference-contexts: For example, the domain of primary key attributes can be partitioned such that primary keys for tuples labeled at different levels are disjoint <ref> [4] </ref>. 8 Both the restricted-value policy and the insert-low policy extend a high update with a low update to eliminate polyinstantiation. In order to avoid covert channels, such extension cannot be done automatically. Rather, it should involve a trusted user performing two B.

Reference-contexts: A. Existing View Policies According to the Bell-LaPadula model, low data can be visible at high. However, since low data could contradict high data in terms of the high view constraints, visibility should be distinguished from believability. The filter function [9], [12] and the security logic <ref> [5] </ref> proposed in the literature take one extreme position by equating believability to visibility, thus maximizing believability. However, integrity is compromised if a low tuple contradicts some high tuples with respect to the high view constraints, which leads to an invalid high database.

Reference-contexts: B. Trusted Interoperation Our policy framework could be used to capture and resolve the MAC policy mismatches in the trusted interoper- ation of heterogeneous multilevel databases. As a first step in this direction, we have investigated the case when the MAC policies mismatch in the lattice component <ref> [6] </ref>. The lattice mismatches are captured in terms of cross-lattice dominance relationships specified by, say, a security officer.

Reference-contexts: All properties derived here have been identified in the literature as desirable, indicating that our interpretation policy for multilevel databases with element-level labeling is natural. In particular, our properties 6.1 and 8 together with property 2.1 of Section III-A form the entity integrity as defined in <ref> [10] </ref>, [12]. Hence our interpretation policy provides a semantic justification of entity integrity. With the natural requirement that null values are not labeled, our property 7 is equivalent to the PI-FD property of [23].

Reference-contexts: A perceived world is a view of the actual world as perceived by a group of users. Information in a perceived world is the knowledge (of a group of users) of the truth value of a statement about the actual world <ref> [17] </ref>, which could be either an elementary fact such as "Enterprise is on mission #101 to Rigel" or a general law such as "starships have unique missions". A (single-level) relational database captures information in a perceived world|the view of the actual world as perceived by users of the database. <p> A standard model-theoretic formulation of a relational database is to interpret relation names as predicates, integrity constraints as axioms in a first-order theory, and relations as forming a first-order structure of the theory <ref> [17] </ref>. A database is valid if the structure is a model of the theory.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [19] </ref>, we have shown that no update policies exist for the no-polyinstantiation security property that have all these desirable properties, which indicates the inherent difficulty of enforcing unconditional no-polyinstantiation.

Reference-contexts: We can show that B and its atomic decomposition B a are semantically equivalent <ref> [20] </ref>. Notice that every tuple in b is in general broken into several smaller tuples in b a . Therefore every elementary fact captured by b is equivalent to a conjunction of perhaps several smaller elementary facts captured by b a . <p> To formulate a natural interpretation policy for element-level labeling, we use the mapping of element-level labeling to tuple-level labeling developed in <ref> [20] </ref>. Let (b; ) be a multilevel database with element-level labeling over (B; L). Consider the atomic decomposition B a of B and the atomic decomposition b a of b.

Reference-contexts: Filtering Functions We can show <ref> [21] </ref> that b b 0 is a database more informative than b but less informative then b [ b 0 , and is the (unique) most informative such database. 4 In Fig. 4, SMD 1 SMD 2 is more informative than SMD 1 because it contains the tuple (Discovery, 103, Rigel). <p> It is less informative than SMD 1 [ SMD 2 because it does not contain the atomic tuple (Enterprise, 102). We can also show <ref> [21] </ref> that b b 0 is a database less informative than b [ b 0 . Moreover, any such database that is strictly more informative than b b 0 has to involve a random choice: there is another such database that is incomparable in information content. <p> one tuple at ? is believable at &gt;, but it is unclear which one should be. 10 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING, VOL. 8, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 1996 In the rest of this section, we outline an atomic flow policy for multilevel databases with tuple-level labeling proposed in <ref> [21] </ref>, where the view constraints consist of key and referential integrity properties, which satisfies the desirable properties identified above.

Reference-contexts: In NTML <ref> [29] </ref>, Thuraisingham first formalized the distinction between visibility and believability by a proof- theoretic semantics of the multilevel relational model, which consists of a nonmonotonic inference rule stating that low data are believable at high as long as they do not contradict high data. <p> The components of a MAC policy could interact in complex ways.

We then develop the technique of atomic decomposition, and characterize the information content of relational databases using the technique. The results obtained here will be used repeatedly in the rest of the paper. A.
