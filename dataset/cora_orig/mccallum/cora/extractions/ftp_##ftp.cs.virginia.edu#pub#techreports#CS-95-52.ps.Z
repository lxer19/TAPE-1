Abstract: This paper proposes new mechanisms to improve the quality of wide-area disseminations of time-sensitive streams, such as packet voice and video, from a single source to multiple receivers. Most current packet-switched networks provide no end-to-end quality-of-service guarantees for packet delay or loss, which can reduce the playback quality at receivers. Buffering at the multicast receivers can be used to minimize the playback degradation due to network delay variations. Addressing packet losses is more problematic. Solutions are constrained by the long latencies that may exist between the source and some of its receivers, the danger of simultaneous messages from a large number of receivers overwhelming network and endsystem resources (multicast implosion), and the limited bandwidth available on most wide-area links. Adapting the transmission rate of the multicast source to the available network bandwidth prevents excessive packet loss and protects the network from severe congestion due to any single source. However, rate control does not recover packet losses. To recover packets dropped by the network, the transmission of redundant information in the data stream (forward error correction) has been shown effective, but redundancy may consume significant network bandwidth and is inefficient when receivers have heterogeneous error rates. In this paper we develop and evaluate a novel retransmission-based error recovery strategy. Unlike previous reliable multicast protocols, our protocol relies on retransmissions from one receiver to another, thus avoiding the limitations of long latencies and multicast implosion inherent to source-driven retransmissions. Local retransmissions enables low latency recovery, uses wide-area bandwidth sparingly, and isolates the impact of losses to one area of the network. Simulation results presented in this paper demonstrate that this retransmission-based scheme can achieve distributed and effective recovery of packet losses for large receiver sets. The results show further that network resources are efficiently utilized and compare favorably with utilization under forward error correction.

Reference-contexts: Error recovery strategies for large-scale time-sensitive multicasts are constrained by considerations of latency, scalability, and limited wide-area bandwidth. A number of reliable multicast protocols have been designed by extending the well-known automatic repeat-request (ARQ) retransmission protocols <ref> [3, 14, 31, 33, 2] </ref>. These protocols, however, are not designed for time-sensitive 2 data such as continuous media, and their error recovery techniques do not scale well to very large receiver sets.

Note that the receiver grouping we require maps well onto the hierarchical structure of contemporary wide-area packet-switched networks. These networks are composed of long-haul links connecting geographically remote campus networks.

Reference-contexts: Open-loop error control such as forward error correction (FEC) has been proposed for wide-area time-sensitive multicasts since it allows packet recovery while adding little delay to the end-to-end delivery path <ref> [4, 16, 34] </ref>. Forward error correction techniques add redundancy to the data stream in order to enable the reconstruction of lost packets from those correctly received. Dramatic improvements in the application error rate have been reported in FEC studies using physical and link layer data replication [24, 25]. <p> candidates for comparison with distributed retransmission, and Section 3.3.3 presents a performance evaluation of these three error recovery strategies over a range of network error intensities. 14 The forward error correction technique used here is modeled on Reed-Solomon codes in which h redundant packets are added to n data packets <ref> [4] </ref>. If any n of the n + h packets are received, then the original data can be recovered. In our experiments H redundant packets are added to each group of packets from N frames, referred to as a FEC (N :H) level of overcoding.

Reference-contexts: The advertisement rate at each retransmission agent is once per second, which results in a network traffic load of about 3% of the multicast video stream.

For the base configuration study, we assign the error intensity value = 0:006 and set the mean number of packets in a burst loss to be = 3.

Reference-contexts: Congestion-based losses can be reduced through dynamic rate control of the multicast source.

Time-multiplexed responses imply a long-duration feedback loop, which yields imperfect knowledge of the network performance at all receivers and limits the rate at which the source can adapt to changing network conditions. <p> A retransmission agent must be selected for each campus group.

This option has the advantage of allowing this functionality to be placed on a well-located and powerful node within the campus network.

Also, recursive encodings such as differential PCM for voice <ref> [8] </ref> and the MPEG video standards [19] may suffer substantial disruptions from a gap in the data since the predictive components at the decoder will lose synchronization. For these reasons even the loss of a single packet may be perceptible during playback.

Reference-contexts: All retransmission protocol actions are constrained by the playback deadline of the lost packets, and outstanding retransmission requests are ignored once this deadline passes. However, the time constraints introduced by playback deadlines are generally not problematic since packet buffers at each multicast receiver can provide relatively long holding times <ref> [10] </ref>. Note that receiver buffering to handle jitter in wide-area distributions is typically in the range of a few hundred milliseconds. The retransmission scheme is, in effect, based on the dynamic construction of a recovery graph in the wide-area topology.

Buffering sufficient data for jitter is easily achieved with modern workstations since limited bandwidth in wide-area networks constrains continuous media multicasts to modest data rates. Current MBONE audiovisual streams <ref> [11] </ref>, for example, consume at most a few hundred Kbits/s of bandwidth. Minimizing the effects of packet losses is more problematic. Some packet loss generally must be tolerated by continuous media applications since timely recovery of lost packets can not be guaranteed.

By sending to the source feedback messages indicating network performance, receivers adapt the data rate of the source to the prevailing network capacity <ref> [6, 17, 34] </ref>. The data rate is adjusted by changing the compression ratio or selectively dropping information, e.g., skipping video frames. <p> To provide a rate control algorithm that avoids the implosion problem for large receiver sets, feedback messages to the source must be time-multiplexed in some manner, e.g., probabilistic polling <ref> [6, 34] </ref>. Time-multiplexed responses imply a long-duration feedback loop, which yields imperfect knowledge of the network performance at all receivers and limits the rate at which the source can adapt to changing network conditions. <p> Open-loop error control such as forward error correction (FEC) has been proposed for wide-area time-sensitive multicasts since it allows packet recovery while adding little delay to the end-to-end delivery path <ref> [4, 16, 34] </ref>. Forward error correction techniques add redundancy to the data stream in order to enable the reconstruction of lost packets from those correctly received. Dramatic improvements in the application error rate have been reported in FEC studies using physical and link layer data replication [24, 25].

Reference-contexts: Most packet-switched networks, however, have no mechanisms for protecting time-sensitive streams in an end-to-end manner from delay variations (jitter) and packet losses that disrupt timely delivery to receivers. Research efforts to develop efficient quality-of-service mechanisms within the network are currently active <ref> [18, 35] </ref>. Even if these efforts are successful and become widely accepted, deployment of mature schemes is unlikely to occur in the near future.
