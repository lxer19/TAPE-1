Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the issues associated with proving complete equivalences within Non-Finite State Systems. The various forms of equivalence that can exist between two algebraically defined systems can be intractable to demonstrate if the systems have infinite state order. The definition of successive finite approximations to equivalences, allows for the construction of simulation tools, which can provide meaningful analysis for Non-Finite State Systems (NFSS) as well as the more usual Finite State Systems. The introduction of this extra variant form of equivalence leads to a discussion of their strictness in comparison with the traditional strict equivalence definitions. The intention being, to show that it is permissible to talk about successive finite approximations approaching strict equivalence in the limit. And finally we want to make suggestions as to how this methodology might be extended in future work to encompass equivalence between non-finite stochastic models. Such an extension would allow for the development of classes of models which all share performance characteristics which lie within acceptable bounds. A characterisation of such models, would be a powerful modelling tool for optimising performance and reliability in proposed network protocols.

Reference-contexts: Such tools are of interest because they allow for the inclusion of performance related information in the design process. In the sections below, such approximation methods are outlined, with a particular emphasis on a graph theoretic approach. CCS <ref> [MIL89] </ref> provides a formal framework for analysing communicating systems of any kind. A central part of CCS is the concept of the silent internal action or t (tau), which represents the interaction between two cooperating subsystems. <p> Around this idea is built the notion of different equivalences between systems; each equivalence having a different way of treating the t . The three central equivalences in <ref> [MIL89] </ref> are: i. Strong equivalence, P ~ Q ii. Equality, P = Q iii. Weak equivalence, P Q The definitions for which are given below: Definition 1 P ~ Q iff for all ff: i. If P ! P 0 , then 9Q 0 such that Q ff ii.
