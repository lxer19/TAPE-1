Abstract: We study the worst case complexity of operator equations Lu = f, where L : G ! X is a bounded linear injection, G is a Hilbert space, and X is a normed linear space. Past work on the complexity of such problems has generally assumed that the class F of problem elements f to be the unit ball of X. However, there are many problems for which this choice of F yields unsatisfactory results. Mixed elliptic-hyperbolic problems are one example, the difficulty being that our technical tools are not strong enoguh to give good complexity bounds. Ill-posed problems are another example, because we know that the complexity of computing finite-error approximations is infinite if F is a ball in X. In this paper, we pursue another idea. Rather than directly restrict the class F of problem elements f, we will consider problems that are solution-restricted, i.e., we restrict the class U of solution elements u. In particular, we assume that U is the unit ball of a Hilbert space W continuously embedded in G. The main idea is that our problem can be reduced to the standard approximation problem of approximating the embedding of W into G. This allows us to characterize optimal information and algorithms for our problem. Then, we consider specific applications. The first application we consider is any problem for which G and W are standard Sobolev Hilbert spaces; we call this the "standard problem" since it includes many problems of practical interest. We show that finite element information and generalized Galerkin methods are nearly optimal for standard problems. We then look at elliptic boundary-value problems, Fredholm integral equations of the second kind, the Tricomi problem (a mixed hyperbolic-elliptic problem arising in the study of transonic flow), the inverse finite Laplace transform, and the backwards heat equation. (Note that with the exception of the backwards heat equation, all of these are standard problems. Moreover, the inverse finite Laplace transform and the backwards heat equation are ill-posed problems.) We determine the problem complexity and derive nearly optimal algorithms for all these problems.

We illustrate this construction by two one-dimensional cases. 15 Example (q = 0): Suppose that d = 1 and = I = <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, with q = 0. Then the eigenfunctions z j and eigenvalues fl j of E fl E are solutions of the eigenproblem q X (1) i z (2i) (s) = fl 2 y (s) 8 s 2 [0; 1]; i=0 j X (1) i z (qj+2i) (1) = 0 <p> = 0): Suppose that d = 1 and = I = <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, with q = 0.

Reference-contexts: If we wish to solve such problems in the worst case setting for L not satisfying these properties, we need to look at other classes F .

Reference-contexts: This particular problem arises in the study of "measurement of the distribution of an absorbing gas (such as ozone in the earth's atmosphere) from the spectrum of scattered light", see <ref> [21, pp. 12-13] </ref>. This may be set up as a standard problem with G = L 2 () and W = H r (). We find that the nth minimal error is fi (n r=d ) and the "-complexity is c fi . <p> Inverse finite Laplace transform. In this section, we look at the complexity of a solution-restricted inverse Laplace transform. This is an example of a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, and is thus an ill-posed problem. This problem arises in remote sensing problems of geomathematics; see <ref> [21] </ref> for discussion and further examples. Without loss of generality, we assume that our functions are defined over the unit interval I = [0; 1]. Define an operator L : L 2 (I) ! L 2 (I) as (Lu)(s) = 0 for u 2 L 2 (I).

Reference-contexts: Since we only have partial information about f , we can only calculate approximations of u = L 1 f . Our goal is to calculate "-approximations (i.e., approximations with error at most ") with minimal cost. This is, of course, a problem of information-based complexity (IBC); see <ref> [22] </ref> for further discussion. We will solve our problem in a worst case setting, so that the error and cost of an algorithm are given by their maximum values over all f . <p> Throughout this paper, we will be especially interested in the following classes fl: (1) fl = fl fl , the class of all continuous linear functionals defined over X. This is a "standard" choice of fl for many problems arising in information-based complexity; see <ref> [22] </ref>. (2) fl = fl F , the class of all linear functionals on F that are bounded on F . Note that fl fl fl F , with equality when F is a ball in X. <p> Our abstract setting is the usual one of information-based complexity, see, e.g., <ref> [22] </ref> and [28]. We wish to compute approximate values of Sf for f 2 F , given a finite number of information values (f ) for some elements 2 fl. <p> We close this section by recalling some standard terminology from <ref> [22] </ref>. Let N denote the nonnegative integers. <p> to be r (n; fl) = inf r (N ); and information N fl n 2 fl n is nth optimal information if r (N fl n ) = r (n; fl). (Note that since F is balanced and convex, we are only considering nonadaptive information of fixed cardinality; see <ref> [22, pp. 57-60] </ref>.) An optimal error algorithm using nth optimal information is said to be an nth minimal error algorithm. We turn these error-related concepts into complexity-related concepts by introducing a model of computation. Our model is the standard one of [22], see also [28, pg. 27]. <p> We turn these error-related concepts into complexity-related concepts by introducing a model of computation. Our model is the standard one of <ref> [22] </ref>, see also [28, pg. 27]. For any 2 fl and any f 2 F , the cost of evaluating (f ) is c, and the cost of basic combinatory operations is 1. Typically, c 1. <p> In what follows, we will let e app , r app , m app , and comp app denote the error, radius, cardinality number, and complexity for the approximation problem. Using <ref> [22, Chapter 3] </ref>, we then find the following: Theorem 3.1. <p> ) = hu N ; w i i W and i (f ) = hSf; w i i W : Hence u N 2 S N satisfies (3.5) iff it satisfies hu N ; w i i W = hSf; w i i W (1 i n): (3.7): Now use <ref> [22, Theorem 5.5.3] </ref>. fl As mentioned in Section 2, we will deal with the classes fl = fl F and fl = fl fl of permissible information operations. <p> L fl i;ffi k W k We then define information N ffi 2 fl fl n as Recall that the radius of information for the Hilbert case is given by the simplified expression r (N ffi ) = sup kwk W 1 Lw2ker N ffi kwk G : (3.8); see <ref> [22, pg. 80] </ref>. Let Lw 2 ker N with kwk W 1.

Reference-contexts: This means we cannot solve ill-posed problems in a worst case setting. If we need to solve such problems, we must go to a different setting, such as the average case setting. For further discussion, see <ref> [23] </ref>, [27], [28]. Summarizing, we see that if the class F is a ball in X, good worst case complexity bounds for operator equations Lu = f have so far eluded us, except for L enjoying special properties.
