Abstract: Agent communication languages (ACLs) provide primitives using which agents may communicate. With the spread of agents and mul-tiagent systems, the standardization of ACLs has become increasingly important. Traditional approaches ignore the fact that communication is inherently public or conventional; it is also sensitive to the context of usage, especially the social context. We describe the fundamental tension between allowing dialects and standardizing ACLs as well as the problem of ensuring that similar conventions do not proliferate under different names. fl This document would not exist but for the constant encouragement of and numerous discussions with Manny Aparicio. I have also benefited from discussions with Michael Huhns, Yannis Labrou, Abe Mamdani, Hyacinth Nwana, David Sadek, and Donald Steiner. However, I alone am responsible for the contents.

Reference-contexts: Mobile agents raise a number of security concerns [ Huhns & Singh, 1997b; Huhns & Singh, 1997a ] . They also raise a number of software management issues, such as how does an incoming mobile agent know what the local database schema is like? <ref> [ Singh, 1997 ] </ref> . Mobile agents have one desirable features, which is that they enable a distributed system to be extensible. That is, through a mobile agent one can add functionality to a remote site in order to improve its capabilities.

Reference-contexts: We have argued that commitments can be used as a basis for uniting these fundamental concepts <ref> [ Singh, 1998 ] </ref> , but that step is not immediately necessary for our present purposes. The semantics of the different communicative acts is given in terms of the social concepts. In any possible society of agents there are rules that apply on their behavior.
