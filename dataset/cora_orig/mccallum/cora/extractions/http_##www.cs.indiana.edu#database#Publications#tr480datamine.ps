Abstract: Technical Report No. 480 Abstract The aim of this research is to establish a coherent framework for data mining in the relational model. Observing that data mining depends on two partitions, the classifier and the estimator, this paper defines the classifier=estimator (CE) framework. The classifier indicates the target of the data mining investigation. The classifier may be difficult to express from the relational instance or may involve an "oracle" beyond the extant data. The estimator is typically simply expressible using the relational instance. The degree to which the estimator refines the classifier partition can be used to measure how well the data instance matches the concept being investigated. The CE framework is shown to generalize a variety of data mining and database concepts, including rough sets, functional dependency, multivalued dependency, and association rules. Furthermore, the CE framework suggests a wider range of data mining questions. The CE framework is shown to naturally express qualitative and quantitative measures of the quality of approximation. Additionally, the CE framework allows a question to be posed at a number of different conceptual scopes from local to global interests.

Reference-contexts: 29], they too are an interesting kind of dependency for a number of reasons: MVDs occur quite frequently, are the "flipside" of FDs (two sets of attributes are wholly independent rather than functionally dependent), and like FDs, there exists a sound and complete set of axioms for reasoning about MVDs <ref> [7, 29] </ref>. Essentially an MVD requires that a set of Y values be associated with a particular X value. In fact, when the relational formalism is extended to allow sets as well as atomic values, an MVD is simply an FD with set-valued attribute on the right-hand side.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Data mining faces a predicament similar to that databases faced prior to Codd's <ref> [8] </ref> introduction of the relational model: different data mining problems seem to have little to do with one another, approaches are generally ad-hoc, there is no concise or precise means of specifying problems, and so forth.

Reference-contexts: First, there is a degree of breadth/specificity, in that the mining may look for general aspects of all the data or specific details of a select subset (variations of which are commonly refered to as "roll-up" and "drill-down" in the data cube approach <ref> [15] </ref>). Second, there is a degree of approximate validity, in that the mined information lies somewhere between true and false (See Fig. 1.) To be somewhat more concrete, suppose our concept is XY , where indicates some relationship between data components X and Y .

Reference-contexts: At a more global level, it might be interesting to find all X such that OE (X; Y) for some Y. Another dimension in which FDs can be investigated is to see how well this fits the data (this is related to <ref> [17] </ref>). This issue is awkward to express in an FOL formulation of functional dependencies, but the many variations are all natural using the CE framework. <p> This example also clearly shows that the CE framework is a conceptual tool and not a recipe for implementation, since in most cases, a single pass through the data will suffice to compute the associative metrics. 6 Metrics There is a large body of work on metrics <ref> [25, 13, 14, 17, 19] </ref>.
