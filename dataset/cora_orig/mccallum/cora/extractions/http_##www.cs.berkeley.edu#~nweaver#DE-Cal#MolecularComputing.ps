Title: Notes on Molecular Computation and Applications  
Author: Nick Weaver 
Date: October 17, 1997  
Abstract: Adleman [1] demonstrated the use of a DNA based computer by solving a small instance of Hamil tonian Path. More recently, Boneh, Dunworth, and Lipton [2] demonstrated an algorithm for attacking DES using molecular computation, as a practical example of molecular computation. These notes sum marizes the algorithm they used, and the implications of molecular computing on cryptography and related fields. My notes are a bit terse, and necessarily gloss over several details, but this should serve as a solid introduction to the concepts and use of molecular computing using DNA.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Techniques in molecular biology have grown quite sophisticated in recent years, allowing the laboratory manipulation of large numbers (10 18 ) strands of DNA. Adleman <ref> [1] </ref> demonstrated how these strands may perform useful (albeit slow) computations in parallel. Boneh, Dunworth, and Lipman [2] have demonstrated how this technique can be used to attack DES. A single strand of deoxyribonucleic acid consists of a string of bases interconnected by sugar links.
