Abstract: The tie between linguistic entities (e.g., words) and their meanings (e.g., objects in the world) is one that a reasoning agent had better know about and be able to alter when occasion demands. This has a number of important commonsense uses. The formal point, though, is that a new treatment is called for so that rational behavior via a logic can measure up to the constraint that it be able to change usage, employ new words, change meanings of old words, and so on. Here we do not offer a new logic per se; rather we borrow an existing one (step logic) and apply it to the specific issue of language change. Note: this paper has appeared in the Proceedings of the 15th Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society, held in Boulder, 1993.

Reference-contexts: The usual fixed language with a fixed semantics that is the stock-in-trade of AI seems inappropriate to this task. Here we do not offer a new logic per se; rather we borrow an existing one (step-logic <ref> [ Elgot-Drapkin and Perlis, 1990 ] </ref> , [ Elgot-Drapkin, 1991 ] ) and apply it to the specific issue of language change. <p> Beliefs at step 1 are those held before the agent's conversation with Sally and those at step 9 reflect 11 E.g., suspending the use of potentially problematic beliefs, in particular the contradictands and their consequences. See <ref> [ Elgot-Drapkin and Perlis, 1990 ] </ref> for details. <p> Finally, the logic itself must be specially tailored to be flexible or "active" enough to allow, even encourage, language change and usage change when necessary. As a theoretical tool the general step-logic framework developed in <ref> [ Elgot-Drapkin and Perlis, 1990 ] </ref> and [ Elgot-Drapkin, 1991 ] is well suited to these desiderata. A step-logic models reasoning by describing and producing inferences (beliefs) one step at a time, where the time of reasoning is integral to the logic.

The one-step-at-a-time approach offers a natural account of such histories.

Reference-contexts: agent to cease believing a wff, that we introduce here, is based on a misidentification. 8 It is likely that default reasoning is involved as is knowledge about the likelihood of errors (e.g., a car is likely to be misidentified since there are typically many similar looking cars). 9 See <ref> [ McCarthy, 1958 ] </ref> for a discussion about programs and advice taking. Now let us extend this to the Two Johns case: We are in a situation in which we are presented with a notion of a person, whom we (come to) think is our friend John.

We will discuss several of the important step-logic inference rules which come into play in steps 1 through 9 of figure 1. (Others are treated fully in <ref> [ Miller, 1993 ] </ref> ). 12 "Observations" can be thought of as nonlogical axioms or facts which the agent acquires over time.
