Abstract: This paper describes an analog VLSI model of the representation of blood pressure used in a neural control system in the cardiovascular system. The chip computes the representation in real time, using analog continuous-time processing. We apply a variety of pressure signals to the chip, confirming that the chip models known physiological responses. We are modeling this representation as a first step to understanding the neural computation of cardiovascular control; we hope to apply this knowledge to nonlinear dynamical control problems in the chemical industry.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the adaptation modeled by the chip, biological baroreceptors adapt their response over many minutes [7]. The transduction mechanism of baroreceptors may also sense the time derivative of pressure, in addition to instantaneous pressure, and present the weighted sum of dP =dt and P to the cell <ref> [1] </ref>; the silicon baroreceptors only sense instantaneous pressure. The chip models a generic baroreceptor; in actuality, there are several classes of baroreceptors [9]. These different classes vary in the extent of the linear range of response to static pressure. An improved baroreceptor circuit would model these additional aspects of behavior.

Reference-contexts: Each baroreceptor connects to a nerve fiber that sends signals to neural circuits in the brainstem. The fibers send signals using fixed-width, fixed-height pulses called action po tentials; information is carried in the rate and temporal position of action potentials <ref> [2] </ref>. Each baroreceptor k is tuned to a specific blood pressure V k , in the range 40-180 mmHg. If the static blood pressure is less than the threshold pressure V k , the baroreceptor fires at a low spontaneous rate or is silent. <p> The baroreceptor firing rate saturates at a constant value for higher static blood pressures. In the dog, spontaneous rates are typically 0-20 spikes per second; saturated firing rates are typically 40-70 spikes per second <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> Over the next 200 ms, the firing spike rate exponentially decays to an asymptotic value, corresponding to the firing rate of the baroreceptor at the static pressure of the step height <ref> [2] </ref>. In a functional cardiovascular system, the baroreceptors typically encode neither static pressure or pressure steps, but a repetitive low frequency pressure waveform corresponding to a steady heartbeat.

Reference-contexts: We began our research effort of the carotid sinus baroreceptor reflex by constructing a functional model of the baroreceptors in the carotid vessel. Inspired by recent work in silicon models of the cochlea <ref> [3] </ref> and the retina [4], we designed and tested a CMOS integrated circuit that models the baroreceptors; this paper reports on this chip.

Reference-contexts: A voltage gradient across this resistor creates a linear threshold gradient across the baroreceptor array. The baroreceptor array outputs are the final outputs of the chip. threshold input V k connect to a half-wave rectifier circuit, operating in the subthreshold region <ref> [5] </ref>. If V &lt; V k , no output current is produced; if V &gt; V k V + V the voltage V; is distributed to the array of silicon baroreceptors; each unmarked box represents a baroreceptor circuit. <p> A PFET operating in the subthreshold region implements I h ; an NFET operating in the subthreshold region implements I l . V k V a I h input and pressure threshold voltages V and V k connect to a half-wave rectifier circuit <ref> [5] </ref>. The current output from the rectifier connects to a neuron circuit [6] that converts the current into fixed-width, fixed-height pulses. These pulses are the output of the circuit, and also are the input to a feedback loop that implements adaptation.

Reference-contexts: We used a novel capacitive divider structure [M. Sivilotti, personal communication] on the transconductance amplifier in the rectifier circuit to increase the value of V o , and thus widen the linear range of the rectifier. The output of the rectifier circuit connects to a neuron circuit <ref> [6] </ref> that converts the input current into a pulse representation. The circuit has a fixed pulse width set by a control voltage. These pulses are the output of the baroreceptor circuit. These pulses are also connected to a feedback circuit that models the dynamic adaptation of biological baroreceptors. <p> V k V a I h input and pressure threshold voltages V and V k connect to a half-wave rectifier circuit [5]. The current output from the rectifier connects to a neuron circuit <ref> [6] </ref> that converts the current into fixed-width, fixed-height pulses. These pulses are the output of the circuit, and also are the input to a feedback loop that implements adaptation. <p> A neuron circuit optimized for low-frequency operation would solve this problem; this optimization involves improving the AC gain of the circuit. Another solution to the problem involves adding a second neuron circuit in series with the first neuron circuit, in a manner similar to the axon circuit of Mead <ref> [6] </ref>. In this axon circuit, the output of the first neuron stage must be fully on before the second neuron stage is activated.
