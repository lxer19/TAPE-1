Note: This document is the reference manual for the POSTGRES database management system under development at the University of California at Berkeley. The POSTGRES project, led by Professor Michael Stone-braker, has been sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Army Research Office (ARO), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and ESL, Inc. POSTGRES is distributed in source code format and is the property of the Regents of the University of Cal-ifornia. However, the University will grant unlimited commercialization rights for any derived work on  that there is no organization who can help you with any bugs you may encounter or with any other prob lems. In other words, this is unsupported software.  This reference describes Version 4.2 of POSTGRES. The POSTGRES software is about 200,000 lines of C  Version 4.2 has been  Digital Equipment Corporation computers based on MIPS R2000 and R3000 processors (under Ultrix 4.2A and 4.3A), Digital Equipment Corporation computers based on Alpha AXP (DECchip 21064) processors (under OSF/1 1.3 and 2.0), Sun Microsystems computers based on SPARC processors (under SunOS 4.1.3 and Solaris 2.3), Hewlett-Packard Model 9000 Series 700 and 800 computers based on PA-RISC processors (under HP-UX 9.00, 9.01 and 9.03), and International  This reference manual describes the functionality of Version 4.2 and contains notations where appropriate to indicate which features are not implemented in Version 4.2. Application developers should note that this reference contains only the  which the system can be extended. 03/12/94 1  
Abstract: The remainder of this reference manual is structured as follows. In Section 2 (UNIX), we discuss the POSTGRES capabilities that are available directly from the operating system. Section 3 (BUILT-INS) describes POSTGRES internal data types, functions, and operators. Section 4 (COMMANDS) then describes POSTQUEL, the language by which a user interacts with a POSTGRES database. Then, Section 5 (LIBPQ) describes a library of low lev el routines through which a user can formulate POSTQUEL queries
