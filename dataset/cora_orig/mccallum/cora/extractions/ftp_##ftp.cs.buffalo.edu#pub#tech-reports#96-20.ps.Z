Reference-contexts: Open-gate: Open-gate defects result in a transistor whose gate is not driven by either a primary input or the output of a gate. Such transistors are known as floating-gate transistors. The behaviour of transistors with floating gates have been studied extensively <ref> [1, 22, 24, 10, 6] </ref>. A study concluded that floating gates acquired voltages below the cut-off of the n-transistor [6]. This implies that floating gate transistors do not conduct. Subsequently, measured gate voltages in the range 0.38 to 2.3V have been reported [10]. <p> These results can be explained by the fact that the voltage at a floating gate is a complex function of the "environment" it is in. Detailed analysis of the effect of the "environment" on the floating gate voltage can be found in <ref> [22, 1, 24] </ref>. The final conclusion is that an FET with a floating gate could be in one of three states: non-conducting, conducting weakly and conducting strongly. Defect d3 of Figure 7 is an example of a defect such that N 1 becomes a floating gate transistor.

Reference-contexts: To detect defective ICs, ICs should be subjected to a variety of tests. A reasonable test suite will inlcude logic testing, at-speed testing and I DDQ testing [17, 29]. There is an ongoing study to ascertain the usefulness of including low voltage testing <ref> [2] </ref>. Recent empirical studies [17, 29] show that at-speed tests detect many defective ICs that are missed during logic and I DDQ testing. Simulation studies also support this claim [2]. <p> There is an ongoing study to ascertain the usefulness of including low voltage testing <ref> [2] </ref>. Recent empirical studies [17, 29] show that at-speed tests detect many defective ICs that are missed during logic and I DDQ testing. Simulation studies also support this claim [2]. Here we ask ourselves the question: are the existing methods good enough to detect defects that causes faulty dynamic logic behaviour ? Similar questions can be asked for logic and I DDQ tests. We do not address those issues here. Currently, various techniques are used to compute at-speed tests.

Reference-contexts: In some cases, the stuck-at test is run at high speed. Others apply functional vectors at high speed. A third approach computes pairs of stuck-at vectors, for selected lines in the circuit, and apply these pairs at-speed. They are referred to as transition tests <ref> [3] </ref>. Such tests were used in the experiments in [17]. Another possibility [17] is to use tests computed for delay testing. Such tests are computed using delay fault models [12, 19, 21] of which the most comprehensive is the path delay fault 2 model.

Reference-contexts: Thus we have gate-source (GS), gate-drain (GD) and source-drain (SD) shorts per transistor. Shorts labeled b1; b2 and b3 of Figure 6 (b) are examples respectively of GS, GD and SD shorts. This example is a modification of an example from <ref> [4] </ref>. Note that GS, GD are different from gate-oxide shorts. When we consider GS or GD, unlike a gate-oxide short, we assume that the transistor is fully functional and equivalent to the fault-free transistor. We discuss the effect defect b1 has on the circuit performance.

Reference-contexts: A new approach to computing atspeed tests is required. * I DDQ testing <ref> [5] </ref> detects many of the defects which, as the above facts suggests, may not be detected during logic testing or at-speed testing. This gives another reason to consider I DDQ testing among the suite of test techniques that are used.

Reference-contexts: There are two types of opens narrow and large. When the opening is large no current can flow between the two ends of the open when a voltage is applied across it <ref> [6, 16] </ref>. For narrow openings (&lt; 100 nm) a small leakage current, due to tunneling effect, flows across the open [6]. <p> When the opening is large no current can flow between the two ends of the open when a voltage is applied across it [6, 16]. For narrow openings (&lt; 100 nm) a small leakage current, due to tunneling effect, flows across the open <ref> [6] </ref>. The impact of open defects on the performance of the circuit is a function of the location and size of the defect, as well as the the electrical parameters of the circuits. In our discussion we use the opens marked d1 : : : d6 in Figure 7. <p> Open-gate: Open-gate defects result in a transistor whose gate is not driven by either a primary input or the output of a gate.

The arrival time of the transition at s depends on the delay along &lt; e; n; q; s &gt; and is independent of delays in the rest of the circuit <ref> [12] </ref>. This is an example of a robust test. Using the notation of Table 1, the logic value assigned by this test-pair to the lines in the circuit is shown in Figure 1 (a).

Reference-contexts: We distinguish between atspeed testing and delay testing. In atspeed testing a defect is assumed to cause the circuit to malfunction. In delay testing the cumulative effect of parameter variations is assumed to cause the circuit to malfunction. Atspeed testing is sometimes referred to as ac-tests <ref> [17, 29] </ref>. To detect defective ICs, ICs should be subjected to a variety of tests. A reasonable test suite will inlcude logic testing, at-speed testing and I DDQ testing [17, 29].

Reference-contexts: In addition to this, robust test-pairs have to satisfy some additional constraints <ref> [18] </ref>. For the path delay fault &lt; c; e; g &gt; r of Figure 5 (a) there are a number of hazard-free robust test-pairs. Some of them are listed in Table 3. <p> To understand why one of these test-pairs will be better than another we need to define off-path input, side fanout gate and side fanout node. Figure 5 (b) defines them, assuming that the path under test is shown using bold lines. The first important conclusion, based on simulation results <ref> [18] </ref>, is that: the propagation delay along a path depends on the values at the side-fanout-node. The first three test-pairs of Table 3 are single path propagating hazard-free robust test-pairs for the path delay fault &lt; c; e; g &gt; r . <p> A third important conclusion is that the vector prior to applying the test-pair (pre-initializing test) is also important in ascertaining the effectiveness of the test-pair. This is based on the following observation <ref> [18] </ref>. The switch-level circuit for gate E is shown in 6 e is affected by the voltage at the internal node q. Node q could be at 0 ( b=1), floating ( b=c=0 ) or a weak 1 because of charge charing between e; q (c=1,b=0).

Reference-contexts: In Figure 1 (b), the first falling edge at s can arrive only after the falling edge at q has arrived making the pair shown a robust test-pair for &lt; e; n; q; s &gt; f .

Reference-contexts: The required background is presented in sections 2 and 3. This is followed by a justification of our claim, respectively for opens and bridges, in sections 4, 5. 2 Characteristics of Delay Tests Delay tests are computed using either the path delay fault model <ref> [25, 12, 27] </ref> or gate delay fault model [7, 31, 32, 8, 19, 9]. The path delay fault model is more comprehensive of the two and we assume this delay fault model in our discussion.

Reference-contexts: In the next two subsections we summarize what is known about the behaviour of VLSI circuits in the presence of shorts and opens. In addition to these defects other defects which are less frequent are <ref> [28] </ref>: punch throughs, parasitic transistor leaks, defective pn junctions, incorrect threshold voltages etc. 3.1 Shorts Shorts, also referred to as bridges, occur when two or more distinct nodes of the circuit get connected due to a defect. Shorts occur when dust or extra material is deposited during fabrication.

Reference-contexts: We distinguish between atspeed testing and delay testing. In atspeed testing a defect is assumed to cause the circuit to malfunction. In delay testing the cumulative effect of parameter variations is assumed to cause the circuit to malfunction. Atspeed testing is sometimes referred to as ac-tests <ref> [17, 29] </ref>. To detect defective ICs, ICs should be subjected to a variety of tests. A reasonable test suite will inlcude logic testing, at-speed testing and I DDQ testing [17, 29]. There is an ongoing study to ascertain the usefulness of including low voltage testing [2].

Reference-contexts: If a node of a gate is slow-to-rise (slow-to-fall) then we have a slow-to-rise (slow-to 7 fall) transition fault. Simulation studies, using the behaviour of the two input NAND gate of Figure 6 (a), for the short between its two inputs X; Y are presented in <ref> [30] </ref>. If U V = 01 and pulldown strength of N2 is larger than the pullup strength of P1 (n-dominant) then the static behaviour is not affected.
