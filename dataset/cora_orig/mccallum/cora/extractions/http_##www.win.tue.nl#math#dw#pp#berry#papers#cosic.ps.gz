Abstract: berry@digicash.com Abstract. ecash TM is a payment system designed and implemented for making purchases over open networks such as the Internet. In this paper we review some of the main cryptographic techniques used throughout the ecash system. We will focus on security aspects as well as some performance related issues. The central notion of an electronic coin is treated in detail, and the basic protocols manipulating coins are described.

Reference-contexts: By using a suitable distribution of the coin denominations upon reloading, possibly as a function of the expected spending pattern, it can be prevented in most cases that a payment cannot be completed although the total value of the coins is sufficient. The CAFE project (see, e.g., <ref> [BBC + 94] </ref>) relies on a compromise between these two basic methods. For each payment the required amount is debited from a counter but at the same time one special coin is used up. The special coins have no value by itself.

Reference-contexts: See, for instance, the SET (Secure Electroncic Transaction) proposal, a joint effort by MasterCard, VISA, and other influential partners, which specifies a hierarchy of certification authorities on top of the payment protocols, as laid out in the iKP system <ref> [BGH + 95] </ref>. Prepaid systems are conceptually close to electronic equivalents of cash. Telephone cards, smart card based systems, as well as ecash fall into this category. The user's account is debited as soon as the card or device is reloaded with electronic cash.

Reference-contexts: Since the introduction of the one-show blinding paradigm and the first solutions to the problem ten years ago <ref> [CFN90] </ref>, the protocols have now developed into an efficient and relatively simple system for off-line cash. A problem with early off-line cash systems was the fact that they heavily relied on computationally expensive cut-and-choose techniques.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we will describe several aspects of the ecash system, mostly security related, and discuss its place among other payment technologies. Ecash finds its roots in the work by Chaum (see, e.g., <ref> [Cha83, Cha90] </ref>), who invented the notion of electronic (or digital) coins as well as the basic protocols for electronic cash. Electronic coins possess similar properties as metal coins, among which is the unique feature that a payment transaction leaves no trace about the identity of the payer. <p> Each protocol is described at a level of detail that permits us to explain the main security features of the ecash system. 6.1 Withdrawal For each ecash coin to be withdrawn from a user's bank account, the user and the mint execute an instance of Chaum's blind signature protocol <ref> [Cha83] </ref>. This protocol is executed in parallel as many times as required to withdraw the desired amount. <p> And, finally, note that whenever a user requests a recovery some privacy is lost, because the bank learns which coins have been spent since the last checkpoint. 7 Privacy We present the by now standard argument why the ecash system protects the privacy of its users <ref> [Cha83] </ref>. To fully protect the users' privacy, the system must satisfy the requirement of unlinkability; a system in which each user gets a pseudonym is not sufficient to protect the privacy of its users.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, this is just an example of the general token functionality that can be achieved with the ecash protocols. The token functionality is in turn subsumed in the general notion of electronic credentials, which encompasses things as diverse as theatre tickets, driver's licenses, passports, diplomas, etc. (e.g., see <ref> [Cha92] </ref>). A crucial property of a credential system is that it allows credentials to be shown in such a way that only the part of the credential relevant to the situation is revealed.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, there are measures to recover from interrupted withdrawals (applying techniques from the field of transaction processing, see, e.g., <ref> [GR93] </ref>). In this section we describe the basic idea behind a special recovery protocol that allows users to recover from more severe problems as well.
