Reference-contexts: For any pair of IP/ATM edge devices (i.e. hosts or routers), a single VC is created on demand and shared for all traffic between the two devices. A second part of the RSVP and IIS over ATM problem, IP multicast, is close to being solved with MARS <ref> [1] </ref>, the Multicast Address Resolution Server. MARS compliments ATMARP by allowing an IP address to resolve into a list of native ATM addresses, rather than just a single address. <p> Figure 5 shows data flow for both modes of IP multicast data distribution. RSVP over ATM solutions must ensure that IP multicast data is distributed with appropriate QoS. In the Classical IP context, multicast server support is provided via MARS <ref> [1] </ref>. MARS does not currently provide a way to communicate QoS requirements to a MARS multicast server (MCS).

Reference-contexts: As this area is critical to deployment, progress will need to be made in this area. 3 Data VC Management Any RSVP over ATM implementation must map RSVP and RSVP associated data flows to ATM Virtual Circuits (VCs). LAN Emulation <ref> [2] </ref>, Classical IP [11] and, more recently, NHRP [12] discuss mapping IP traffic onto ATM SVCs, but they only cover a single QoS class, i.e., best effort traffic. When QoS is introduced, VC mapping must be revisited. <p> There is also the possibility of future encapsulation options, such as MPOA [3]. The first option is described in RFC 1483 [9] and is currently used for "Classical" IP over ATM and NHRP. The second option is LAN Emulation, as described in <ref> [2] </ref>. LANE encapsulation does not currently include a QoS signalling interface. If LANE encapsulation is needed, LANE QoS signalling would first need to be defined by the ATM Forum.

There are a number of other issues that are subjects of continuing research. These issues (and others) are covered in <ref> [5] </ref>, and are briefly repeated here. A major issue is providing policy control for ATM VC creation. There is work going on in the RSVP working group [8] on defining an architecture for policy support. Further work is needed in defining an API and policy objects.

Reference-contexts: QoS translation concerns mapping a QoS from the IIS model to a proper ATM QoS, while VC management concentrates on how many VCs are needed and which traffic flows are routed over which VCs. Mapping of IP QoS to ATM QoS is the subject of a companion draft <ref> [6] </ref>. This draft concentrates on VC management (and we assume in this draft that the QoS for a single reserved flow can be acceptably translated to an ATM QoS).

Reference-contexts: For real-time traffic such as voice and video, the current Internet has performed well only across unloaded portions of the network. In order to provide guaranteed quality real-time traffic, new classes of service and a QoS signalling protocol are being introduced in the Internet <ref> [7, 18, 17] </ref>, while retaining the existing best effort service. The QoS signalling protocol is RSVP [8, 19], the Resource ReSerVation Protocol. ATM is rapidly becoming an important link layer technology.

One of the important features of ATM technology is the ability to request a point-to-point Virtual Circuit (VC) with a specified Quality of Service (QoS). <p> RESV messages that simply refresh state do not trigger resource requests. Resource requests may be made based on RSVP sessions and RSVP reservation styles. RSVP styles dictate whether the reserved resources are used by one sender or shared by multiple senders. See <ref> [8] </ref> for details of each. Each new request is referred to in this document as an RSVP reservation, or simply reservation. * Flow is used to refer to the data traffic associated with a particular reservation. The specific meaning of flow is RSVP style dependent. <p> LANE encapsulation does not currently include a QoS signalling interface. If LANE encapsulation is needed, LANE QoS signalling would first need to be defined by the ATM Forum. It is possible that LANE 2.0 will include the required QoS support. 6 Security The same considerations stated in <ref> [8] </ref> and [14] apply to this document.

Reference-contexts: These mechanisms may include such things as permissions and/or billing. For scaling reasons, policies based on bilateral agreements between neighboring providers are considered. The bilateral model has similar scaling properties to multicast while maintaining no global information. Policy control is currently being developed for RSVP (see <ref> [10] </ref> for details). 1.2.3 ATM We assume ATM defined by UNI 3.x and 4.0, plus TM 4.0. ATM provides both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint Virtual Circuits (VCs) with a specified Quality of Service (QoS). ATM provides both Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs) and Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs). <p> Receivers initiating VCs via the reverse path mechanism provided by point-to-point VCs is also for future study. 2 Policy RSVP allows for local policy control <ref> [10] </ref> as well as admission control. Thus a user can request a reservation with a specific QoS and with a policy object that, for example, offers to pay for additional costs setting up a new reservation.

Reference-contexts: It is only natural that RSVP and the Internet Integrated Services (IIS) model would like to utilize the QoS properties of any underlying link layer including ATM. Classical IP over ATM <ref> [11] </ref> has solved part of this problem, supporting IP unicast best effort traffic over ATM. Classical IP over ATM is based on a Logical IP Subnetwork (LIS), which is a separately administered IP sub-network. <p> As this area is critical to deployment, progress will need to be made in this area. 3 Data VC Management Any RSVP over ATM implementation must map RSVP and RSVP associated data flows to ATM Virtual Circuits (VCs). LAN Emulation [2], Classical IP <ref> [11] </ref> and, more recently, NHRP [12] discuss mapping IP traffic onto ATM SVCs, but they only cover a single QoS class, i.e., best effort traffic. When QoS is introduced, VC mapping must be revisited. For RSVP controlled QoS flows, one issue is VCs to use for QoS data flows.

LAN Emulation [2], Classical IP [11] and, more recently, NHRP <ref> [12] </ref> discuss mapping IP traffic onto ATM SVCs, but they only cover a single QoS class, i.e., best effort traffic. When QoS is introduced, VC mapping must be revisited. For RSVP controlled QoS flows, one issue is VCs to use for QoS data flows. <p> Since the new QoS is only needed by the new next-hop, it should be the first end-point of the new VC. This way signalling is minimized when the setup to the new next-hop fails. 3.7 Short-Cuts Short-cuts <ref> [12] </ref> allow ATM attached routers and hosts to directly establish point-to-point VCs across LIS boundaries, i.e., the VC end-points are on different IP sub-nets. The ability for short-cuts and RSVP to interoperate has been raised as a general question. The area of concern is the ability to handle asymmetric short-cuts. <p> Future work depends on the development of NHRP for multicast. Furthermore, when using RSVP it may be desirable to establish multiple short-cut VCs, to use these VCs for specific QoS flows, and to use the hop-by-hop path for other QoS and non-QoS flows. The current NHRP specification <ref> [12] </ref> does not preclude such an approach, but nor does Berson, Berger Expires September 26, 1997 [Page 21] Internet Draft Integrated Services with RSVP over ATM March 1997 it explicitly support it. We believe that explicit support of flow based short-cuts would improve RSVP over ATM solutions.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, data VCs set up to support RSVP controlled flows should only be released at the direction of RSVP. VCs must not be timed out due to inactivity by either the VC initiator or the VC receiver. This conflicts with VCs timing out as described in RFC 1755 <ref> [14] </ref>, section 3.4 on VC Teardown. RFC 1755 recommends tearing down a VC that is inactive for a certain length of time. Twenty minutes is recommended. This timeout is typically implemented at both the VC initiator and the VC receiver. <p> LANE encapsulation does not currently include a QoS signalling interface. If LANE encapsulation is needed, LANE QoS signalling would first need to be defined by the ATM Forum. It is possible that LANE 2.0 will include the required QoS support. 6 Security The same considerations stated in [8] and <ref> [14] </ref> apply to this document.

Reference-contexts: RFC 1755 recommends tearing down a VC that is inactive for a certain length of time. Twenty minutes is recommended. This timeout is typically implemented at both the VC initiator and the VC receiver. Although, section 3.1 of the update to RFC 1755 <ref> [15] </ref> states that inactivity timers must not be used at the VC receiver. When this timeout occurs for an RSVP initiated VC, a valid VC with QoS will be torn down unexpectedly.
