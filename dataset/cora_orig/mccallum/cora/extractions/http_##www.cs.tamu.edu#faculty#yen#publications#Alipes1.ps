Abstract: Finding relevant information effectively on the Internet is a challenging task. Although the information is widely available, exploring Web sites and selecting the right document are still considered a time consuming and tedious task. As a result, many software agents have been launched in cyberspace to perform autonomous information gathering and filtering on behalf of its users. One of the important issues for these agents is to adapt to the changing interests of the users. In this paper, we present Alipes, an Information Broker-ing Agent that learns user's interests and provides personalized news articles retrieved from the Internet.

Reference-contexts: WebMate keeps track of user interests in different domains through multiple TF-IDF vectors (Salton 1993). The domains are learned automatically as users give positive examples. A more similar system, Fab, was also developed by Balabanovic. Fab is an adaptive system for Web page recommendation <ref> (Balabanovic 1997) </ref>. The initial version of this system uses single feature vector weighted using TF-IDF method to represent its user's profile. In the more recent version, the system has been extended to allow multi-topic user interests (Balabanovic 1998).

Most of the above works use feature vectors as the representation of user interests and represent an interest category with a single-descriptor approach.

There are much other relevant efforts within the distributed AI and the multi-systems community. Another similar system is INFOS (Intelligent News Filtering Organizational System) which is developed by Mock. INFOS used feature vectors to represent user's interests (Mock 1996).
