Abstract: The role of topographical constraints for recognition performance is investigated systematically for the case of face recognition. Images are represented by rectangular graphs labeled with jets, based on a Gabor wavelet transform. Topographical constraints are varied between rigid and free matching. A comparison with two elastic graph matching algorithms is made. The simple methods and elastic graph matching perform comparably on easy galleries, i.e. different facial expression or 11 ffi rotation in depth. On a 22 ffi gallery, elastic graph matching performs significantly better.

Reference-contexts: The second one, S OE (J ; J 0 ), takes phase into account. It is more sensitive to displacements and potentially more discriminative since jets with same magnitudes but different phase relations can be distinguished. 3 Database All experiments are done on the Bochum face database <ref> (Lades et al., 1993) </ref>. For most persons there is one neutral frontal view (fa), one frontal view of different facial expression (fb), and two views rotated in depth by about 11 ffi and 22 ffi , respectively. <p> However, experiments show that the performance of the latter does not decrease if a sparse subset of 25 jets is used instead of the full set of 100 jets. System <ref> (Lades et al., 1993) </ref> matches each individual model separately but uses no phase information. System (Wiskott et al., 1997) uses the face-bunch-graph approach and phase information for matching. Both systems use no phase information for recognition.

Reference-contexts: For the difficult gallery with larger rotation in depth, elastic graph matching performs significantly better than the primitive methods used here. These results allow interesting conclusions about the potential of different neural systems for translation invariant object recognition. Systems which ignore topographical constraints <ref> (e.g. Rosenblatt, 1961) </ref> would correspond to column P = all in Table 4. Systems with a fixed routing and some tolerance to local distortions by blurring (e.g. Fukushima et al., 1983; Olshausen et al., 1993) would correspond to columns P = 1; :::; 6.

Reference-contexts: We employ a discrete set of 5 different spatial frequencies and 8 orientations resulting in 40 complex coefficients per pixel. Jets can be compared by two different similarity functions <ref> (Wiskott et al., 1997) </ref>. The first one, S a (J ; J 0 ), ignores the phase of the complex coefficients. This is in analogy to using a power spectrum. <p> Matching with phase yields better results than without phase in most of the cases. Recognition without phase has a minor advantage over recognition with phase, an effect hardly noticeable in this experiment but more pronounced if a face bunch graph is used for matching (see below and <ref> (Wiskott et al., 1997) </ref>). <p> In the previous experiments each model was matched to the image graph independently, i.e. a different set of node correspondences was used for each model. Matching of each individual graph becomes expensive for large galleries but it can be avoided by using the bunch graph technique <ref> (Wiskott et al., 1997) </ref>. A bunch is a set of jets taken from the same node from different model graphs. For example, all jets taken from the node in the third row and fourth column constitute the right eye bunch. <p> For very different poses, 3 the face bunch graph approach may be superior if a face bunch graph is available for the new pose while the models are given only in the original pose <ref> (cf. Wiskott et al., 1997) </ref>. Figure 2 gives an impression of how reliable the matching is. Degradation in matching quality correlates well with degradation of recognition rates (compare Fig. 2 with Tables 3 and 4). <p> However, experiments show that the performance of the latter does not decrease if a sparse subset of 25 jets is used instead of the full set of 100 jets. System (Lades et al., 1993) matches each individual model separately but uses no phase information. System <ref> (Wiskott et al., 1997) </ref> uses the face-bunch-graph approach and phase information for matching. Both systems use no phase information for recognition.

Reference-contexts: However, if the generalization over image variation becomes more demanding, the matching methods perform clearly better. A good strategy for biological systems may therefore be to first perform fast recognition with no or little topographical constraints and then refine the recognition process by taking topographical constraints into account. System <ref> (Wiskott and von der Malsburg, 1996) </ref> has also been tested on the Bochum gallery. Although it is based on dynamic link matching and should thus perform well, its recognition rates on 111 faces was only 92% on 11 ffi , 66% on 22 ffi , and 85% on fb.
