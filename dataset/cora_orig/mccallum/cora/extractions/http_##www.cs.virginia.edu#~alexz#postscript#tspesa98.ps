Abstract: Previous literature on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) implicitly assumed that the sites to be visited are stationary. Motivated by practical applications, we introduce a time-dependent generalization of TSP which we call Moving-Target TSP, where a pursuer must intercept a set of targets which move with constant velocities in a minimum amount of time. We propose approximate and exact algorithms for several natural variants of Moving-Target TSP. Our implementation of the exact algorithm of One-Dimensional TSP is available on the Web.

Additional related papers and our code may be found at http://www.cs.virginia.edu/ ~ robins/ since they generalize TSP without the triangle inequality, which admits no effi-cient approximation bounds unless P = N P <ref> [1] </ref>. In this paper, we address several natural variants of Moving-Target TSP. In Section 2, we show that unlike the classical TSP, the restriction of Moving-Target TSP to one dimension is not trivial, and we give an exact O (n 2 )-time algorithm.

Reference-contexts: There are several different heuristics for the Multiprocessor Scheduling Problem: list scheduling, longest processing, and many others, including a polynomial-time approximation scheme <ref> [3] </ref>. Unfortunately, the error estimates for these heuristics cannot be transformed into bounds for Moving-Target TSP with Resupply and multiple pursuers because a multiplicative factor corresponds to the exponent in such transformations.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The classical Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) has been studied extensively, and many TSP heuristics have been proposed over the years (see surveys such as <ref> [4] </ref> [7]). Previous works on TSP have assumed that the cities/targets to be visited are stationary. <p> Our implementation is available on the Web. 2.2 Heuristics when the Number of Moving Targets is Small In this subsection, we consider Moving-Target TSP when most of the targets are stationary (while a few targets may be moving). From among the many existing approximation algorithms for classical (stationary) TSP <ref> [4] </ref>, choose one such heuristic, having performance bound ff. Using this algorithm for stationary targets, we can construct an efficient algorithm (see Figure 2) with performance bound of 1 + ff when the number of moving targets is sufficiently small.
