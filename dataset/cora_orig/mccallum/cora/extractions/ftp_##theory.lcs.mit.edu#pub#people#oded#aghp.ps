Title: Simple Constructions of Almost k-wise Independent Random Variables  
Author: Noga Alon Oded Goldreich Johan H-astad Rene Peralta 
Keyword: Probabilistic computation, removing randomness, shiftregister se quences, small probability spaces.

Abstract: We present three alternative simple constructions of small probability spaces on n bits for which any k bits are almost independent. The number of bits used to specify a point in the sample space is (2 + o(1))(log log n + k=2 + log k + log 1 * ), where * is the statistical difference between the distribution induced on any k bit locations and the uniform distribution. This is asymptotically comparable to the construction recently presented by Naor and Naor (our size bound is better as long as * &lt; 1=(k log n)). An additional advantage of our constructions is their simplicity.

Reference-contexts: The minimal polynomial for x will give the feedback rule. 10 Remark: It is possible to get slightly more bits without affecting the bias of linear tests. Let v 1 , v 2 : : : v m be a basis of GF [2 m ] over GF <ref> [2] </ref>. Then we can extract nm bits by letting b ij = (bin (v j x i ); bin (y)). The bias of any xor is still n2 m . The proof of this fact is almost identical to the present proof. <p> The bias of any xor is still n2 m . The proof of this fact is almost identical to the present proof. The only difference is that we get a polynomial over GF [2 m ] instead of a polynomial over GF <ref> [2] </ref>. 6 Main Theorems for Almost k-wise independence Let us put the pieces together. All three constructions use at most 2m bits to get n bits with n2 m -bias with respect to linear tests. <p> With probability at least 1 2 m , at least one of these points specifies a sequence of m polynomials containing at least one irreducible polynomial (cf. <ref> [2, 13, 20, 17, 8] </ref>). This sampling requires O (m) bits. Call the resulting sample space E m . * A sample point in E m specifies O (m 2 ) polynomials and with overwhelming probability at least one of them is irreducible.

Reference-contexts: We present three alternative constructions of sample spaces of size roughly ( n * ) 2 for which the exclusive-or of any fixed bit locations, in the sample point, induces a 0-1 random variable with bias bounded by *. Another construction with similar parameters can be given <ref> [3] </ref> by applying the known properties of the duals of BCH codes (see [23], page 280). Our three constructions are so simple that they can be described in the three corresponding paragraphs below: 1. <p> ffi &gt; 0, such that for every n and * 2 ffin : m (n; *) ( * 2 log 1=* 12 What happens when * &lt; 2 ffin ? A lower bound which is sharp in this range for m (n; *) is given in the following result from <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> The construction that can be obtained using the BCH-codes, also gives ffi = 2 <ref> [3] </ref>. 8 Concluding Remarks All our three constructions admit fast translation of the succinct representation into the full length sample point. In fact, given succinct representation s and bit location i, the i th bit of the sample determined by s can be computed in N C.

Reference-contexts: A typical property is that the probability distribution, induced on every k bit locations in a string randomly selected in the sample space, should be uniform. Such a sample space is called k-wise independent. Alon, Babai and Itai <ref> [5] </ref> presented an efficient construction of k-wise independent sample spaces of size approximately n k=2 , where n is (as above) the length of the strings in the sample space. This result is very close to best possible, in view of the lower bound of Chor. et. al. [11]. <p> A sample space is called linear if its elements are obtained by a linear transformation of their succinct representation (equivalently, the sample space is a linear subspace). For example, the construction of a k-wise independent sample space presented by Alon, Babai and Itai <ref> [5] </ref> is linear. To be more precise they construct a sample space on n bits, where n = 2 t 1, which is generated by td+1 bits and is (2d + 1)-wise independent. <p> Hence R m N is (*; k)-independent (in max norm), and 2 k=2 *-away (in L 1 norm) from k-wise independence. Using the construction in <ref> [5] </ref> we get: Corollary 2 (Naor and Naor): Let k &lt; n be an odd integer and N 2 b 2 (n1) k1 c 1. <p> Here we briefly comment on this problem. We note that tight bounds for the related quantity which is the minimum possible size of a sample space in which there are n random variables which are k-wise independent are given in [11] and in <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Our objective is to study the function m (n; *). A very similar function is studied in <ref> [6] </ref>, and most of the techniques applied there can be used in our case as well, as we briefly describe below.

Reference-contexts: This result is very close to best possible, in view of the lower bound of Chor. et. al. <ref> [11] </ref>.

This fact led Naor and Naor to introduce the notion of almost k-wise independent sample spaces. <p> A linear test can be interpreted as trying to refute the randomness of a probability space by taking a fixed linear combination of the bits in the sample. The following lemma, attributed to Vazirani [29] (see also [30], <ref> [11] </ref>), links the ability to pass linear tests with almost independence. Lemma 1 (Vazirani): Let S n f0; 1g n be a sample space that is *-biased with respect to linear tests of size at most k. <p> Here we briefly comment on this problem. We note that tight bounds for the related quantity which is the minimum possible size of a sample space in which there are n random variables which are k-wise independent are given in <ref> [11] </ref> and in [5].

Construction 4 suffices as a randomized preprocessing for Constructions 2 and 3, and for a modification of Construction 1 (sketched below). However, for Construction 1 (as appearing in Section 3) we need the ability to select a random irreducible polynomial (and not merely to find and fix one).

To summarize, the construction of small sample spaces which have some randomness properties is of major theoretical and practical importance. A typical property is that the probability distribution, induced on every k bit locations in a string randomly selected in the sample space, should be uniform.

A more advantageous way of using *-biased (w.r.t. linear tests) sample spaces, than just using Corollary 1, was suggested by Naor and Naor <ref> [25] </ref>: They combine the use of a sample space which is *-biased w.r.t. linear tests with a "linear" k-wise independent sample space. A sample space is called linear if its elements are obtained by a linear transformation of their succinct representation (equivalently, the sample space is a linear subspace). <p> A very similar function is studied in [6], and most of the techniques applied there can be used in our case as well, as we briefly describe below. Besides these techniques, we need a new result, stated in proposition 4 below. As mentioned in <ref> [25] </ref> the problem of estimating m (n; *) can be best formulated as a problem about error correcting codes. Indeed, suppose there is a sample space of size m and n (0; 1)-random variables as above over it. <p> This is the case, for example, when m is selected such that the sample space is *-away from log n-wise independent, for some fixed * (or * = n O (1) ) (cf. <ref> [25] </ref>). In a preprocessing stage (of complexity 2 s ), we may enumerate all monic polynomials of degree s and discard those which have non-trivial divisors. Similarly, to find a prime larger than M , we can test all integers in the interval [M; 2M ] for primality.
