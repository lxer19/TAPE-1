Abstract: Ant System is a general purpose algorithm inspired by the study of the behavior of Ant Colonies. It is based on a cooperative search paradigm that is applicable to the solution of combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper we introduce MAX MIN Ant System, an improved version of basic Ant System, and report our results for its application to symmetric and asymmetric instances of the well known Traveling Salesman Problem. We show how MAX MIN Ant System can be significantly improved extending it with local search heuristics. Our results clearly show that MAX MIN Ant System has the property of effectively guiding the local search heuristics towards promising regions of the search space by generating good initial tours.

Reference-contexts: With this approach the solution quality for longer runs increased significantly. To give an indication of the performance with respect to solution quality of MMAS, we present the results of MMAS for some TSP in Table I. The TSPs were taken from the First International Contest on Evolutionary Optimization <ref> [1] </ref>. For an easier comparison to other existing improved variants of Ant System we also give the results obtained with Ant Colony System (ACS, on of the best existing extension of Ant System [9]), for these problems, see Table II.

Another interesting issue is the development and study of techniques for automatic adjustment of the most important parameters of MMAS. In this context, evolutionary approaches might be a promising approach.

Reference-contexts: As we usually choose m equal to the number of nodes this results in an overall complexity of O (n 3 ). Therefore, the run time grows rather fast with increasing problem size. To lower the run time for MMAS, we considered the possibility of adding candidate sets [16], <ref> [5] </ref>. Besides of reducing computation times by far this modification also has a positive influence on the performance of MMAS.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the trail intensities are updated according to the formula 2 d i;j can be interpreted as the distance between nodes i and j. 3 For a more detailed description of the Ant System algorithm the reader is referred to <ref> [6] </ref>. 4 To induce a probability distribution, we have to divide the numbers by a common denominator. <p> Yet, as before among the strategies on how to add local search to the MMAS there is no clear winner. C. Cooperation improves local search Cooperation among the ants helps the basic Ant System and its variations to significantly improve the performance <ref> [6] </ref>, [17]. Now we will show that this is still true if we add a local search phase to improve the solution of the ants. <p> Another interesting issue is the development and study of techniques for automatic adjustment of the most important parameters of MMAS. In this context, evolutionary approaches might be a promising approach. The application of the Ant System is not limited to TSPs (as can be seen e.g. in <ref> [6] </ref>); therefore we also plan to investigate whether our encouraging results for MMAS on TSP carry over to other problem classes.

Reference-contexts: In practice, the long term effect of the trail intensities is to successively reduce the size of the effective search space by concentrating the search on a relatively small number of arcs. To characterize the amount of exploration Ant System performs, the -branching factor was introduced in <ref> [10] </ref>. For the value of = 0:05 we found out that if the if the mean 0:05-branching factor is very close to 1, only very few (often only one) arc exiting from a node have a very high selection probability and practically no new solutions are explored.

Reference-contexts: In the more general asymmetric TSP (ATSP) at least for one pair of nodes we have d ij 6= d ji .

It also has become a standard testbed for algorithms that try to find near optimal solutions to N P-hard combinatorial optimization problems.

Reference-contexts: Local search is also often used to improve the performance of Genetic Algorithms [18], [8] and also has been used in one application for Ant System <ref> [13] </ref>. The reason for adding local search algorithms to MMAS is twofold: On the one hand, we want to enhance the performance by adding local search, yielding an earlier detection of high quality solutions and to guide the learning mechanism mroe directly. <p> The combined system outperforms local search with restart by far, which shows that MMAS is very effective in guiding the local search heuristic. Additionally we investigated several possibilities of how to add local search to MMAS. We are only aware of one other work <ref> [13] </ref>, in which Ant System was combined with a local search phase. In other experiments, not reported here, we also could show that MMAS with local search outperforms Ant System with additional local search [17]. Apart from Ant System, many different heuristics have been applied to the TSP.

Reference-contexts: To alleviate the problems concerning early stagnation, we introduced explicit maximum and minimum trail strengths on the arcs, hence the name MAX MIN Ant System. The maximum and minimum trail limits are chosen in a problem-dependent way depending on the average arc length (for details we refer to <ref> [17] </ref>). This way the influence of the trail intensities is limited. As we use as a lower limit t min , the probability that a specific arc is chosen may become very small, but will be still greater than zero. <p> Yet, as before among the strategies on how to add local search to the MMAS there is no clear winner. C. Cooperation improves local search Cooperation among the ants helps the basic Ant System and its variations to significantly improve the performance [6], <ref> [17] </ref>. Now we will show that this is still true if we add a local search phase to improve the solution of the ants. We consider only the case in which all ants perform local search and a fixed number of 10; 000 tour constructions and local searches is allowed. <p> We are only aware of one other work [13], in which Ant System was combined with a local search phase. In other experiments, not reported here, we also could show that MMAS with local search outperforms Ant System with additional local search <ref> [17] </ref>. Apart from Ant System, many different heuristics have been applied to the TSP. We do not claim that our approach can yet compete with specialized TSP-algorithms like iterated Lin-Kernighan (see [11], [14]).
