Abstract: Many multicast applications, including audio and video, require quality of service (QoS) guarantees from the network. Hence, multicast admission control and resource reservation procedures will be needed. In this paper we present a general framework for admission control and resource reservation for multicast sessions. Within this framework, efficient and practical algorithms that aim to efficiently utilize network resources are developed. The problem of admission control is decomposed into several subproblems that include: the division of end-to-end QoS requirements into local QoS requirements, the mapping of local QoS requirements into resource requirements, and the reclaming of the resources allocated in excess. These are solved independently of each other yielding a set of mechanisms and policies that can be used to provide admission control and resource reservation for multicast connection establishment. The resource allocation algorithms we consider specifically accommodate receiver heterogeneity (in both end-to-end and per-hop QoS requirements) by reserving necessary and sufficient resources for a multicast session. An application of these algorithms in the context of packetized voice multicast connections over the Mbone is provided to illustrate their applicability.

Similar observations were also made in <ref> [7] </ref>. Our approach to the problem of multicast connection establishment is as follows: first route the multicast connection (determine the multicast tree) using one of the existing algorithms and then do resource allocation (with admission control) and resource reclaiming on the multicast tree. We address these latter two problems.

Reference-contexts: We address these latter two problems. The algorithms are developed to solve a static multicast problem (where all receivers are known before the session's setup). An extension to solve a dynamic multicast problem (where receivers can join or leave anytime during the life of the session) is presented in <ref> [11] </ref>. Distributed algorithms for the receiver oriented multicast connection establishment is the subject of a future work. In Section 2 we give a formal statement of the problem. A decomposition of the problem is found in Section 3 along with a number of alternative solutions to each sub-problem. <p> The dynamic multicast problem is a variation of the above where receivers can join or leave anytime during the life of the session. In this paper we address the static multicast problem. The dynamic multicast problem is addressed in <ref> [11] </ref>. <p> In this computation only the path attribute is needed (V P =j L (P ) j and V l = ;). The case where one or more links has an insufficient amount of resources to accommodate an even division of QoS is considered in <ref> [11] </ref>. Proportional division policy This policy is designed to balance the loads on the links in the network over the long term by allocating, for each new session, fewer resources on those links that are more highly utilized and thus avoiding the formation of bottleneck links. <p> We prove the following in <ref> [11] </ref>: Theorem 1 The Even and Proportional division policies are uniform division policies. The Even and Proportional QoS division policies also exhibit the uniformity property when there are a finite num ber of QoS classes. The above uniformity property allows us to introduce an ordering among paths. <p> If M is admitted, a sufficient amount of resources is allocated at the links in T . Here we outline the allocation algorithm; centralized and distributed versions are described in detail in <ref> [11] </ref>. This algorithm is an extension, to multicast sessions, of a scheme proposed for unicast sessions in [10]. <p> Finally, a link shared by multiple sender-receiver paths is assigned the tightest (minimum) local QoS requirement. This algorithm has a transactional form, is deadlock free and the transient over-reservation of resources does not significantly impact the network (see <ref> [11] </ref> for details). Observe that, after assigning the minimum of QoS on a shared link, at least one sender-receiver path containing that link has more resources allocated than necessary to guarantee its end-to-end QoS requirement. <p> Taking N =jDj as the number of destinations and M =jT j as the number of links in the multicast tree, we show in <ref> [11] </ref> that GENERAL RECLAIMER has a worst case running time of O (N M ). 3.4.2 An improved algorithm The complexity of GENERAL RECLAIMER can be reduced if the QoS division policy is uniform. <p> Defining a critical path in T being the set of links in T that get their tightest QoS requirement from the same (critical) receiver, we show in <ref> [11] </ref> that if the QoS division policy is uniform then T is partitioned in critical paths (see for an example Fig. 4). The complexity is reduced in IMPROVED RECLAIMER by computing the resource allocation once per critical path rather than once per link as in GENERAL RECLAIMER. <p> The remaining unmarked forest is then considered, another critical path that starts with a node from a processed path is selected and the procedure is repeated until all of T is processed. We prove in <ref> [11] </ref> that IMPROVED RECLAIMER reduces the worst case running time to O (N 2 + M ) from O (N M ) for GENERAL RECLAIMER. <p> The durations of the on and off periods are exponential random variables with means 1= and 1= respectively. We show in <ref> [11] </ref> based on [13, 5] that in order to guarantee the loss probability q k at a link, it is sufficient to reserve the following effective bandwidth at that link: F (q k ) = B k q B k 2 log q k : Given a link with available capacity
