Abstract: A procedure is given for recognizing sets of inference rules that generate polynomial time decidable inference relations. The procedure can automatically recognize the tractability of the inference rules underlying congruence closure. The recognition of tractability for that particular rule set constitutes mechanical verification of a theorem originally proved independently by Kozen and Shostak. The procedure is algorithmic, rather than heuristic, and the class of automatically recognizable tractable rule sets can be precisely characterized. A series of examples of rule sets whose tractability is non-trivial, yet machine recognizable, is also given. The technical framework developed here is viewed as a first step toward a general theory of tractable inference relations. This paper appeared in JACM, vol. 40, no. 2, April 1993.

Reference-contexts: The congruence closure procedure determines whether an equality s = t can be proven from a given set of equations and the symmetry, reflexivity, transitivity, and congruence axioms of equality <ref> [1] </ref>. Each of these algorithms can be viewed as a decision procedure for the inference relation generated by a certain set of inference rules. This paper identifies a general class of "local" rule sets. These rule sets have the desirable property that the generated inference relation is polynomial time decidable.

Reference-contexts: However, local inference rules can be used to reduce proof length in first order proof systems. This can be done through the construction of a Socratic sequent system <ref> [2] </ref>. A sequent is an expression of the form ` where is a set of formulas and is a formula. If ` R then we say that a rule set R generates the sequent ` . <p> Aspects of the syntax of English under Mantague semantics have been used to construct particularly powerful general purpose local rule sets <ref> [2] </ref>. Determining the locality of an arbitrary rule set can be difficult | it is not known whether locality, as a property of rule sets, is decidable.

Reference-contexts: The rule set consisting of the reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, and congruence axioms of equality is bounded local so the locality of this rule set can be mechanically recognized by the procedure given here. This amounts to mechanical verification of a theorem given in <ref> [3] </ref>, [8], and [7].

An example is also given of a rule set that is local but 3 not bounded local. <p> The definition of locality does not provide any obvious way of determining if a given rule set is local. Locality of the equality inference rules was originally proved (using different terminology) independently by Kozen <ref> [3] </ref> and Shostak [8]. Kozen uses a syntactic argument to show that if ` E , then ` E . The proof is essentially an induction on the length of the derivation used to establish ` E . Shostak's proof of the locality of E is semantic.

Reference-contexts: However, because the rule set generating obvious sequents is local, the correctness of a proof can still be verified in polynomial time. Particular Socratic sequent systems for set theory and first order logic are described in [5] and <ref> [4] </ref>. It appears that the power of the local rule set in a Socratic sequent system can be enhanced through the use of a nonstandard syntax for first order logic. <p> Even without quantifiers, a set of rules can still generate an undecidable or intractable inference relation. On the other hand, the presence of quantifiers does not necessarily prevent tractability. Tractable inference relations involving quantification are discussed in [5] and <ref> [4] </ref>. A more general notion of locality will be needed to construct a procedure for automatically recognizing tractability in rule sets that involve quantification. Definition: An expression of kind formula will be called a formula.
