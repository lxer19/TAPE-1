Abstract: In this work we consider a bicriterion extension of equilibrium problems formulated as variational inequalities, and propose for its solution a generalization of the Frank-Wolfe method. Under suitable monotonicity assumptions on the cost function and a reasonable regularity assumption, we prove that the Frank-Wolfe iterates converge linearly to the unique solution of our equilibrium problem. 1. Introduction and problem formulation. Consider the problem of determining an equilibrium state resulting from the interaction of infinitely many agents

Reference-contexts: To study the uniqueness of an equilibrium solution x, we introduce the infinite dimensional linear program LP obtained by setting X to its current value: LP : min hF (X) + ffG; yi: This problem is a parametric continuous linear program of the bottleneck type (see Anderson and Nash <ref> [1] </ref>).

In this situation, the optimal stepsize can be obtained in closed form.

Since is weakly closed and g is weakly continuous (easy to show), it follows that x 2 and g (x) = 0.

In this context, the users of the transportation network seek to minimize their individual cost expressed as the sum of a monetary component and a time component.

Reference-contexts: continuous and nonnegative on and it is clear that x is a solution of the variational inequality (4) if and only if g (x) = 0, i.e., x is a global optimum of the mathematical program: min g (x):(8) Note that the function g need not be convex (see Marcotte <ref> [10] </ref>). Throughout this section, we assume that the function F is monotone on b , that the function G is constant on b and that Condition A holds. <p> Under these assumptions (see Theorem 2.3), the variational inequality (4) is monotone and, by generalizing techniques developed for the finite-dimensional case (see Marcotte <ref> [10] </ref>), it can be shown that any stationary point of (8) solves the variational inequality (4). Furthermore, under Condition A, the solution y (x) of the linear program: min hH (x); x yi is unique, and x solves the variational inequality (4) if and only if y (x) = x.

Reference-contexts: Then an equilibrium assignment corresponds to an origin-destination flow density vector x k a (ff) that satisfies the infinite-dimensional variational inequality: hF (X) + ff Note that, in the above, the state variable ff divides G, instead of multiplying it. The reader is referred to Marcotte and Zhu <ref> [11] </ref> for further details. In the standard traffic assignment model (see Florian [6]), under a strict mono-tonicity assumption, only the uniqueness of the total arc flow vector is guaranteed, since the decomposition of arc flows into commodity flows is not unique, in general.
