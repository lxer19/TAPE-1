Title: Simulating Threshold Circuits by Majority Circuits 1 (Revised Version)  
Author: Mikael Goldmann Marek Karpinski 
Date: August, 1994  
Pubnum: TR-94-030  
Abstract: We prove that a single threshold gate with arbitrary weights can be simulated by an explicit polynomial-size depth 2 majority circuit. In general we show that a depth d threshold circuit can be simulated uniformly by a majority circuit of depth d + 1. Goldmann, H-astad, and Razborov showed in [10] that a non-uniform simulation exists. Our construction answers two open questions posed in [10]: we give an explicit construction whereas [10] uses a randomized existence argument, and we show that such a simulation is possible even if the depth d grows with the number of variables n (the simulation in [10] gives polynomial-size circuits only when d is constant). 1 A preliminary version of this paper appeared in Proc. 25th ACM STOC (1993), pp. 551-560.

On the other hand, it was proved by Chandra, Stockmeyer, and Vishkin <ref> [8] </ref> that addition of n binary encoded integers can be performed by constant depth majority circuits (see also [20]).

Reference-contexts: We introduce also uniform classes of threshold circuits. In doing so we can use the threshold circuit descriptions, e.g. similar to the "Direct Connection Language" of Ruzzo [23] (see also <ref> [9] </ref>). 4 Let BIN be the set of binary encodings of the positive integers. A threshold circuit C n with n inputs is described by an edge-labeled multi-graph (V n ; E n ). <p> We call a sequence of circuits P -uniform if the description of the nth circuit can be generated in polynomial time on input 1 n (cf., e.g. <ref> [9] </ref>). We define the following operator. Definition 3 The operator rem is defined as follows. For integers a and b, a rem b = c; 4 The case of majority circuits is when the weights are only allowed to be 1 or 1.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that a single threshold gate is strictly more powerful than a single small-weight threshold gate.

Two open questions were posed in [10]: Can one make an explicit construction, and can one make it work also for non-constant depth? ([10] uses a probablilistic argument, and the blowup in size is super-polynomial if the depth grows with the number of variables.) We give positive answers to both questions. <p> This was done in <ref> [10] </ref> by considering sign (ffF (x)) for a randomly chosen integer ff 2 f1; 2; : : : ; 2 2n g. Since ff &gt; 0 one has sign (F (x)) = sign (ffF (x)). <p> In our case the probability space is small enough that we may take the average over all possible choices of parameter values. We will modify the construction. Just like in <ref> [10] </ref> we will use a multiplier ff, but it will be much smaller. For a random ff, the probability of a truncation error is small. <p> This is a constructive version of Theorem 7.8 from <ref> [10] </ref>. Theorem 10 LT 1 ( d LT 2 : Proof. We will prove the inclusion. That it is strict follows from the fact that parity is in d LT 2 n LT 1 . Assume n 100, smaller inputs are handled by writing the function on disjuntive normal form. <p> We will now generalize this to show that a depth d, polynomial-size, threshold circuit can be simulated by a depth d + 1, polynomial-size, majority circuit. In <ref> [10] </ref> Goldmann, H-astad, and Razborov introduced a circuit class that mixes small and large weights. Definition 6 g LT d is the class of functions computable by depth d, polynomial-size, circuits where the top gate has polynomially bounded weights. 14 We will show the following theorem.

Reference-contexts: Allender [1] (inspired by Toda [28]) shows that any function in AC 0 can be computed by depth 3 majority circuits of quasi-polynomial size. Yao <ref> [33] </ref> extends this to all of ACC 0 (see also [5]). There are some strong lower bounds for majority circuits of very small depth.
