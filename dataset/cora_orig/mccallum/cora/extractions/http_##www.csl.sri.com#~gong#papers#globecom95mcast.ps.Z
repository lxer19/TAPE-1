Title: Trade-offs in Routing Private Multicast Traffic  
Author: Li Gong and Nachum Shacham 
Address: Laboratory,  
Affiliation: SRI International, Computer Science  
Abstract: Multicast is a convenient and important mode of communication in internetworks, and there has been a number of studies on efficient routing of multicast traffic. In particular, simulation has been performed to evaluate the tradeoffs between source-specific trees and shared trees, and between various routing algorithms. In this paper, we show that the consideration of security brings a new set of tradeoffs in routing private multicast traffic. We describe these trade-offs between security, trust, knowledge of group membership and of topology, types of multicast tree, bandwidth consumption, and latency. We propose four methods to improve efficiency: message pruning, message reprocessing, hot-start authentication, and continuous authentication. This study of new trade-offs helps in choosing the appropriate multicast strategies for specific applications.

Reference-contexts: Superficially, adding security to mul-ticast merely requires that traffic is made private by the use of encryption. The typical approach is to generate a group key to be shared among participants of a specific multicast session, and all traffic is encrypted with this key <ref> [1] </ref>. Such a simple approach does not address the problem that a malicious participant, who legitimately has the group key, would be able to forge a message as if it originates from a different address [3]. <p> It was argued that a disadvantage of such schemes is that every sender has to know the membership information <ref> [1] </ref>. However, because controlling multicast membership is the essential ingredient of secure multicast, what needed is merely to carry over membership information from the stage when the multicast session is formed to the actual multicast communication stage. <p> Our motivation is to show that different secure broadcast algorithms perform differently when used on top of different underlying transport mechanisms (e.g., shortest-path-trees, shared trees, and core-based trees <ref> [1] </ref>). In the rest of paper, we describe these trade-offs be tween security, trust, knowledge of group membership and of topology, types of multicast trees, bandwidth consumption, and latency. <p> The cost of each edge can reflect its length and the quality and the speed of the connection. Changes in the multicast topology need to be reported to the root so that pruning strategy can be updated. Message pruning especially suits multicast mechanisms such as core-based Trees <ref> [1] </ref>. There, the core is the root of the multicast tree. Each sender sends its message to the core who then multicasts it down the tree. The core can also be notified of each new member's join (if existing members behave correctly). <p> This approach is particularly suitable for multicast using core-based trees (CBT) <ref> [1] </ref>. In CBT, a sender does not multicast directly; instead, it sends the message to a core - the root of the multicast tree which then multicasts the message. In CBT, any addition to the tree is also known to the core. <p> We have proposed message pruning and message reprocessing for addressing this scalability problem, which are very suitable for multi-cast with core-based trees <ref> [1] </ref> and can be easily integrated.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Multicast is a convenient mode of communication in internetworks, as demonstrated by the deployment of IP-multicast and the activities over the M-Bone <ref> [2] </ref>. As a result, the efficiency of multicast routing algorithms has become an important subject of study, and there are several efforts investigating ways to reduce the total bandwidth consumption (e.g., [5, 4, 7]). <p> The cost of transporting the security header can easily exceed that of the message itself. For example, around 600 sites took part in an IETF meeting over M-Bone in 1994 <ref> [2] </ref>. A short message "Hello, John Smith is here.", which can be contained in 25 bytes, would need (just as a very long message would need) a header of 16 fi 600 = 9600 bytes. Moreover, this extra header is replicated throughout the multicast tree. <p> The best tree is the flattest, e.g., when there is a direct connection between the root and each leaf. When there is an upper bound on the fan-out degree, then the most efficient topology is a balanced tree. This applies to M-Bone because, as reported by 1993 <ref> [2] </ref>, a typical M-Bone fan-out is below 10. The cost of each edge can reflect its length and the quality and the speed of the connection. Changes in the multicast topology need to be reported to the root so that pruning strategy can be updated.

Reference-contexts: Because multicast is by nature a group-oriented application, security mechanisms are required to protect multicast participants against outside attackers as well as against malicious insiders <ref> [3] </ref>. Superficially, adding security to mul-ticast merely requires that traffic is made private by the use of encryption. The typical approach is to generate a group key to be shared among participants of a specific multicast session, and all traffic is encrypted with this key [1]. <p> Such a simple approach does not address the problem that a malicious participant, who legitimately has the group key, would be able to forge a message as if it originates from a different address <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> An alternative is to use dynamic group keys in secure broadcast schemes <ref> [3] </ref>. There, every pair of potential sender and receiver either share a secret key or know each other's public keys. The sender chooses a (dynamic) key to encrypt a multicast message, possibly on a per-message basis. <p> One of the earliest is based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem. A much more efficient scheme is recently proposed that uses shorter messages <ref> [3] </ref>, so we briefly describe the latter. These algorithms all apply to securing ATM multipoint VCs. Suppose A is to multicast a message m to n receivers, I 1 ; : : : ; I n . <p> Because the key k for encrypting a message is chosen independently by the sender, it can be changed on a per-message basis, and thus the name dynamic keys. (For more detailed security argument and variations such that when message integrity but not privacy is required, please refer to <ref> [3] </ref>.) Because the size of q (in mod (q)) is O (log n), the security header has O (n log n) bits. <p> Second, the numbers of subgroups and their keys can be exponential. Moreover, sometimes updating the group key cannot be done in-band by using the old group key to distributed the new group key. An alternative to group key is to use secure broadcast algorithms (e.g., <ref> [3] </ref>), which however requires an additional message header for security that grows at least linearly in size with the size of the multicast group.
