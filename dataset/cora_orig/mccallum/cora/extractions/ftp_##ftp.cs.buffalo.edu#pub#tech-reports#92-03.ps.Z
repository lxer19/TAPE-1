Abstract: Image segmentation is a process of dividing an image into meaningful regions. Human supervision of computer generated segmentation is essential for the tasks such as medical image analysis, surveillance-radar image analysis, etc. The decisions to be made based on the segmented images is often critical in such domains, and neither human imprecision nor the unreliability of automatic algorithms is tolerable. We develop a collaborative scheme that facilitates active human supervision of computer segmentation of images. Through this, we complement the reliability of a human expert with the precision of segmentation and deformable modeling algorithms that track a stationary or moving nonrigid object in a sequence of snap-shots of the scene. In our system, an expert user observes the computer generated segmentaion along with the original images in a user friendly graphics environment, and interactively indicates the wrongly classified regions either by pointing or by circling. The precise boundaries of indicated regions are computed by studying original image properties at that region, and the human visual attention distribution map obtained from the published psychological and psychophysical research. All refinement operations are defined in the form of a linear functions so that the facilities such as error recovery, commutativity of operations, etc. are inherent to the system. We use the developed theory to extract heart walls from a sequence of two dimensional echocardiograms. Echocardiography is one of the most popular and safest methods of observing the heart. Segmentation of the heart wall in echocardiograms is essential to detect and quantize a large spectrum of heart abnormalities.

In addition, they supported the spot-light theory by showing that the field of attention had uniform reaction time. A psychophysical analysis of the visual attention span is reported by Mangun et al. <ref> [7] </ref>, where they studied the changes in the event related brain potentials (ERPs) with respect to visual stimuli as the locus of attention was shifted across the visual fields. <p> Our region growing algorithm finds the exact contours of the pointed regions, and our new 10 sketch (left) and a two dimensional echocardiogram. deformable modeling algorithm captures the exact contours of the circled regions.

Since each region L (x i ) in the image is contiguous, and the study shows that visual sensitivities fall steeply with the distance from the point of attention <ref> [8] </ref>, physical distance (P d ) defined by P d (x 0 ; x 1 ) = k 1 :jx 0 x 1 j, between any two points in an intended region must be small. 2.

Reference-contexts: Although human experts are good at classifying the regions of interest in a global sense, they are imprecise at drawing detailed boundaries of the regions. Such jobs are either very tedious or the required precision may be beyond human capability <ref> [12] </ref>. Hence the manually traced region boundaries are often not reproducible and may contain subjective local variations. In addition, even though an expert can provide a good qualitative assessment of the observed data, it is difficult for him to provide precise quantitative results [13].

Reference-contexts: The estimate is displayed along with the corresponding original image. The operator uses the visualization facility to compare the estimate with the original image. If any misclassified regions are found, he indicates them interactively either by pointing or by circling <ref> [15] </ref>. To enable natural interactions, we treat the interactive inputs as approximate suggestions, and not as accurate descriptions. In addition, to find the precise extent of indicated suggestions, we use human vision attention map obtained from psychophysical research [7]. Therefore all the interactive suggestions undergo refinement before execution. <p> In this scheme we generate an initial estimate of the heart wall by morphologically influenced thresholding, and refined the estimate by picking points on the misclassified regions. Pointing and circling are convenient modes of interactive specifications <ref> [67, 68, 69, 15, 70] </ref>. In addition, in case of poor quality data, when it is not easy to specify a region precisely, a user prefers circling to indicate fragmented regions [67]. <p> The estimate is displayed along with the corresponding 2DE. The operator uses the visualization facility to supervise the estimate. If any misclassified regions are found, he indicates them interactively either by pointing or by circling <ref> [67, 15] </ref>. In our scheme, the interactive inputs are considered as approximate suggestions, and not as accurate descriptions. All the interactive suggestions undergo a data dependent refinement, before execution.

Reference-contexts: Generating an initial estimate: Extraction of the heart wall from 2DE can be viewed either as an edge detection problem, where heart wall contours are to be extracted [23], or as a thresholding problem, where the wall region is to be separated from the background <ref> [24, 25] </ref>. Edge detection is a popular contour extraction method in optical images processing [26, 27]. <p> Manual tracing is tedious and inefficient, and the contours have low reproducibility [18, 45]. A variety of methods for automatic and semiautomatic extraction of cardiac wall have been reported. These methods can be classified into 1) thresholding <ref> [25, 46, 47, 48, 24] </ref>, 2) edge detection [49, 23, 50, 51, 52], and 3) model [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61] based techniques. 2.1.1 Thresholding based techniques Thresholding based techniques work on the principles of classical optical image thresholding schemes, but are modified to account for the <p> Revankar and Sher <ref> [25] </ref> used the regional morphological enclosures to modify the default global threshold according to the spatiotemporal coherency, so that the noise was suppressed and the contours were preserved. Siler et al. [46] proposed threshold selection by regional histogram analysis and made it adaptive by Geiser's method [62]. <p> Hence, extraction of the cardiac structure or detection of wall boundaries using conventional thresholding results in noisy images with jagged edge patterns. The wall thickness variation is an important measure used for diagnosis, and it varies with the variation in the level of the 11 threshold <ref> [25] </ref>. Therefore, the precision of the selected threshold value is more critical in processing 2DE, than it is for processing optical images of text or line diagrams, where the thickness information is often ignored [82, 83]. <p> The best-fit morphological template is determined by finding the three dimensional (3X3X3) enclosure that has the average gray value that deviates the most from the global threshold g t . A two-dimensional representation of these enclosures is shown in Figure 7. Our threshold selection technique <ref> [25] </ref> approaches an ideal threshold in several ways. It suppresses the formation of speckles on the background because N (:) is small and the threshold is large, and it suppresses holes in the object because N (:) is large and the threshold is small.

The right image corresponds to a 2DE, and it does not provide a good estimate of the heart wall region.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the sound wavelengths usable for echocardiography exhibit orientation dependent drop-offs because of specular reflections.

Complexity of the scanned environment: Echocardiograms portray a complex structure of human tissues in and around the heart, and hence there is considerable aliasing between the cardiac wall echoes 7 sional echocardiogram. and the echoes from the surrounding tissues.

Reference-contexts: Even within the similar data-area the echodensity (gray value) is not uniform. As explained, poor quality of the data combined with the complexity of the scanning environment, make the automatic heart wall extraction unreliable.

Reference-contexts: Revankar and Sher [25] used the regional morphological enclosures to modify the default global threshold according to the spatiotemporal coherency, so that the noise was suppressed and the contours were preserved. Siler et al. [46] proposed threshold selection by regional histogram analysis and made it adaptive by Geiser's method <ref> [62] </ref>. Zhang et al. [47] used local temporal coherence to select a threshold. They picked the threshold that maximized the number of boundary pixels between neighboring 2DE frames. Usually thresholding schemes do not discriminate between the registered echodensities of uninteresting cardiac artifacts, and that of heart wall.

Reference-contexts: This may lead to subjective variations and erroneous propagation of corrections, because heart wall motion is not known to be a linear function of time. To avoid this we developed a collaborative scheme where the computer is made to detect the precise boundaries of the suggested corrections <ref> [63] </ref>. In this scheme we generate an initial estimate of the heart wall by morphologically influenced thresholding, and refined the estimate by picking points on the misclassified regions. Pointing and circling are convenient modes of interactive specifications [67, 68, 69, 15, 70]. <p> Later, they splined the boundary points to obtain a smooth endocardial border. 9 We studied the Sobel's and a new orientation independent edge detector <ref> [34, 63] </ref>, and results were not encouraging on our data set. 2.1.3 Model based techniques Deformable models [57, 58] and regional probability models [59, 61] have been used to extract inner wall contours. <p> In our collaborative scheme, the expert indicates the misclassified regions either by picking points or by circling them. The precise boundaries of the regions indicated by the points are computed using a new region growing technique described below. Preliminary results of this scheme are encouraging <ref> [63] </ref>. We intend to use deformable modeling to get the precise boundaries of the circled region, 13 because it is natural for such an application. Similar applications have been reported in the literature [5, 3, 4]. <p> All distance measures are computed on the original image. Once the intended regions are computed, they are added to or deleted from the earlier output to get a refined output. Preliminary results of refinement of this model have been encouraging <ref> [63] </ref>. Some examples of updating by picking points are shown in Figures 8, 9, and 10. Refinement by deformable modeling: In general deformable modeling algorithms seek global minima of a heuristically defined energy function through some regularization method.

Reference-contexts: The angle subtended by the spot-light is about 1 o at the viewer's eyes [75]. Later Ericsen [76] and LaBerge <ref> [77] </ref> showed that the spot-light has flexible boundaries and its size is task dependent. Hughes et al. [6] examined the spatial extent of the visual attention by inducing subjects to expect the target at a location and introducing occasional probe flashes at other locations 4 throughout the visual field.

Reference-contexts: Their study supported both the spot-light and the gradient models of the visual attention maps. Additional evidences to support these models are provided by Shulman et al. <ref> [78] </ref> and Bashinski [79]. Tsal [80] showed that the decrease in attention was linear with respect to the angle sub-tended at the viewer's eyes. While the above methods studied mainly the luminance detection paradigm, Downing [8] studied the visual attention maps for luminance detection, brightness discrimination and form discrimination paradigms.

Reference-contexts: Both of these algorithms account for the visual attention map of a human operator [6, 7, 8]. After the first stage of corrections, if the updated estimates of the heart wall were satisfactory, they can be used for direct quantitative measurements [44, 43, 40], including the measurement of motion <ref> [56, 81] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the precision of the selected threshold value is more critical in processing 2DE, than it is for processing optical images of text or line diagrams, where the thickness information is often ignored <ref> [82, 83] </ref>. Ideally, a thresholding scheme must generate a smooth and continuous hear wall structure that correlates with the echo data.

Reference-contexts: Ideally, a thresholding scheme must generate a smooth and continuous hear wall structure that correlates with the echo data. In other words it must satisfy the following criteria <ref> [84, 85] </ref>: * eliminate noise speckles on the background or on the object * preserve the boundaries and wall thickness * generate a smooth heart wall boundaries * fill-in the weakly reflecting parts of the heart wall.

Reference-contexts: We develop a thresholding scheme that approaches these ideal requirements. The `state of the art' ultrasound systems allows us to make 30 to 60 scans per second <ref> [86] </ref>. Hence every time slice takes only a few milliseconds. The motion of the heart wall is relatively slow and it rarely moves more than about 2mm in 1 30 of a second at its maximal velocity.

Reference-contexts: Similar applications have been reported in the literature [5, 3, 4]. Once the boundaries of the regions are obtained, the regions are classified according to operator's suggestions, thereby generating a refined estimate of the heart wall. Refinement by region growing: Region growing is a popular method of segmentation <ref> [87] </ref>. Most region growing techniques techniques are developed for unsupervised segmentation of the images [88, 89], but we intend to develop a supervised segmentation algorithm, wherein an expert supervisor indicates the corrections by pointing at the misclassified regions.

Reference-contexts: Sometimes 2DE data has large dropouts. Currently such regions are filled either by linear interpolation <ref> [90] </ref> or by splining [24, 91]. We intend to study the feasibility of solving this problem using deformable open contours. The same scheme could also be used for collaborative correction of sections of misclassified boundaries or for correction of thickness of a section of the wall.
