Abstract: The authors wish to express their deep appreciation to Professor Christoph von der Malsburg for providing the general theoretical context by which biological face recognition might be modeled, his help in using the face recognition systems that he and his associates have developed, and for a number of stimulating and helpful discussions. We also thank Dr. Wolfgang Konen for his assistance and support in our implementation of ZN-Face. We also wish to thank Jzsef Fiser, for his help in the use of KBVision software, Pearl Fang and Nancy Wang for their assistance in creating the stimuli and running the subjects. This research was supported by ARO NVESD grant DAAH04-94-G-0065 and ONR N00014-95-1-1108.

Reference-contexts: Rotation in depth. If objects differ in NAPs, then little or no cost is apparent when they are rotated in depth, as long as the same surfaces are in view <ref> (Biederman & Gerhardstein, 1993) </ref>. In contrast, when the differences are in metric properties, such as aspect ratio or degree of curvature, then marked rotation costs are observed (e.g., Edelman, 1995).

Reference-contexts: When asked to describe a picture of a person's face, these individuals will often refer to a famous person, perhaps with some modification in the descriptions <ref> (Cesa, 1994) </ref>. Poor recognizers tend to pick a single feature or small set of distinctive features. As people age, face recognition performance declines. This decline is marked by a qualitative shift in the representation such that older people, like poor face recognizers in general, search for distinctive features.

Reference-contexts: It would be impossible to move a region or a feature or to change a feature without affecting the coding of a number of kernels from a number of jets.

Reference-contexts: Selective impairment: Prosopagnosia and object agnosias . Prosopagnosia, the inability to recognize familiar faces but with a normal or near normal capacity for object recognition, is a well documented phenomenon, generally associated with lesions to the right, inferior mesial hemispheric <ref> (Grsser & Landis, 1991) </ref>, although some (e.g., Damasio, Damasio, Van Hoesen, 1985) have argued that the lesions must be bilateral.

Reference-contexts: In looking at the right column, the reader can assess for himself or herself how modest variation in the metrics of a face can result in marked interference in the recognition of that face <ref> (see also Hosie, Ellis, & Haig, 1988) </ref>. In these images of celebrities, the eyes have been raised. A similar variation in the length (and, hence, aspect ratio) of an object part, as illustrated in figure 4, has little or no effect in the assignment of objects to classes.

Whereas people have great difficulty in identifying a face from a photographic negative or when illuminated from below <ref> (Johnston, Hill, & Carmen, 1992) </ref>, there is little, if any, effect of reversing the polarity of contrast of a picture of an object (Subramaniam & Biederman, 1997). Viewing an object at one polarity provides essentially the same information as to the structure of the object as does the other polarity.

Reference-contexts: When easy nonaccidental cues are eliminated, such as glasses, facial hair, and the hairline, even modest rotations of faces, from 20 left to 40 right, as illustrated in figure 7 (middle row), can result in marked increases in RTs and error rates in their matching <ref> (Kalocsai, Biederman, & Cooper, 1994) </ref>. 7. Rotation in the plane. Recognizing an upside-down face is extremely difficult relative to identifying an upside-down object, such as a chair (e.g., Yin, 1969; Johnston, et al., 1992; Jolicoeur, 1985). <p> Top, middle, and bottom rows show changes in expression, orientation (60), and both expression and orientation, respectfully. The similarities as determined by the Lades et al. (1993) model correlated highly with performance in matching a pair of images when there were at different orientations and expressions <ref> (Kalocsai et al., 1994) </ref>. Turning a face upside down would greatly reduce its similarity to that of the original image.

Reference-contexts: Each column of filters is termed a "Gabor jet" and each jet is presumed to model aspects of the wavelet-type of filtering performed by a V1 hypercolumn. We will first consider the initial version of the model <ref> (Lades et al, 1993) </ref>, which will be referred to as the lattice version. This model can be applied to the recognition of faces and objects so it has the potential to serve as a device for the scaling of both kinds of stimuli.

Reference-contexts: Because these experiences include contribution of the dorsal system in which position, size, and orientation of the stimulus is specified, it is not surprising to find cells that are tuned to the specific orientations and characteristics of the trained stimuli <ref> (e.g., Logothetis, Pauls, Blthoff, & Poggio, 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: There are several effects that would suggest some role of such norm based coding in face recognition. Caricatures can be created by enhancing deviations (e.g., by 50%) of points on a particular face from the population values <ref> (see Rhodes & Tremewan, 1994, for a recent review) </ref>. Moreover, for famous faces the recognition accuracy of such caricatures does not suffer in comparison to-and can sometimes be found to exceed the recognition accuracy of the original face (Rhodes & Tremewan, 1994). <p> Moreover, for famous faces the recognition accuracy of such caricatures does not suffer in comparison to-and can sometimes be found to exceed the recognition accuracy of the original face <ref> (Rhodes & Tremewan, 1994) </ref>. Carey (1992) and Rhodes (1994) tested whether the caricature gains its advantage in recognition (or resists a loss) because of the increased "distinctiveness" of the distortions in face space.

Whereas people have great difficulty in identifying a face from a photographic negative or when illuminated from below (Johnston, Hill, & Carmen, 1992), there is little, if any, effect of reversing the polarity of contrast of a picture of an object <ref> (Subramaniam & Biederman, 1997) </ref>. Viewing an object at one polarity provides essentially the same information as to the structure of the object as does the other polarity. <p> In both experiments III and IV, on half the same trials the second presented image was identical to the first and in the other half the trials it was the complementary image. 3 A recent study <ref> (Biederman & Subramaniam, 1997) </ref> provides strong documentation that the Lades et al. (1993) system can provide an a priori measure of shape similarity when the pairs of shapes only differ in metric properties.

Reference-contexts: This model can be applied to the recognition of faces and objects so it has the potential to serve as a device for the scaling of both kinds of stimuli. A more recent version <ref> (Wiskott et al., 1997) </ref> , the "fiducial point" model, incorporates general face knowledge. We will ignore preprocessing stages by which a probe image is translated and scaled to achieve a normalized position and size. Overall illumination levels and contrast are similarly normalized. <p> We will also consider two other possible extensions of the model: The explicit use of spatial distances and normative coding by which a face is represented in terms of its deviations from a population norm. In the fiducial point model <ref> (Wiskott, Fellous, Krger, & von der Malsburg, 1997) </ref>, the jets are not initially arranged in a rectangular lattice but, instead, each jet is centered on a particular landmark feature of the face, termed a fiducial point, such as the corner of the right eye.

Reference-contexts: Expertise. Good face recognizers use the whole face, although with unfamiliar faces, the overall external shape and hairline receive extremely high weight <ref> (Young, Hay, McWeeny, Flude, & Ellis, 1985) </ref>. When asked to describe a picture of a person's face, these individuals will often refer to a famous person, perhaps with some modification in the descriptions (Cesa, 1994). Poor recognizers tend to pick a single feature or small set of distinctive features.

Reference-contexts: Another result that is not obviously derived from the lattice model is the extraordinary difficulty in recognizing the components of a face where the upper half is of one famous person and the lower half another, with the upper and lower halves smoothly aligned to constitute a single face <ref> (Young, Hellawell, & Hay, 1987) </ref>. When the upper and lower halves are offset it is much easier to identify the component individuals.
