Abstract: There are three main approaches within the AI community to constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) and constraint optimisation problems (COP): Domain-filtering, Treesearch, and Repair-based methods. The purpose of this paper is to present an algorithm, no-good backmarking, that unifies these techniques. It is repair-based and guarantees to find a solution (optimal) to a CSP (COP), if one exists. The no-good backmarking algorithm is a development of an approach called no - good justifications. The search space of the proposed algorithm is controlled by a backmarking strategy which records generic patterns of partial labels that are found to be inconsistent. Variables that contribute to inconsistencies are relabelled in the spirit of dependency directed backjumping. The proposed method accepts a relabelling if it reduces the number of conflicts (or the cost) of the current label. Repair-based methods, of which this is an example, have been shown to be useful for large combinatorial optimisation problems. They are also well suited to solving CSPs in a dynamic environment (DCSP) where the set of constraints may change over time. While ng-backmarking retains all of the features of repair-based methods, optimisation using ng-backmarking is facilitated by the generic information gathered during search. Unlike most repair-based techniques in which complete inconsistent labels are repaired, ng-backmarking also repairs partial inconsistent labellings. The ng-backmarking method can be seen as a generalisation of tabu search in simulated annealing . The application of such techniques as ng-backmarking to DCSPs is also discussed.
