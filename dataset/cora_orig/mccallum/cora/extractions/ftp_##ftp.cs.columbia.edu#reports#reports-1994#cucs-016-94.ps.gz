Abstract: Let F be a class of functions defined on a d-dimensional domain. Our task is to compute H m -norm "-approximations to solutions of 2mth-order elliptic boundary-value problems Lu = f for a fixed L and for f 2 F . We assume that the only information we can compute about f 2 F is the value of a finite number of continuous linear functionals of f, each evaluation having cost c(d). Previous work has assumed that F was the unit ball of a Sobolev space H r of fixed smoothness r, and it was found that the complexity of computing an "-approximation was comp("; d) = fi(c(d)(1=") d=(r+m) ). Since the exponent of 1=" depends on d, we see that the problem is intractable in 1=" for any such F of fixed smoothness r. In this paper, we ask whether we can break intractability by letting F be the unit ball of a space of infinite smoothness. To be specific, we let F be the unit ball of a Hardy space of analytic functions defined over a complex d-dimensional ball of radius greater than one. We then show that the problem is tractable in 1=". More precisely, we prove that comp("; d) = fi(c(d)(ln 1=") d ), where the fi-constant depends on d. Since for any p &gt; 0, there is a function K() such that comp("; d) c(d)K(d)(1=") p for sufficiently small ", we see that the problem is tractable, with (minimal) exponent 0. Furthermore, we show how to construct a finite element p-method (in the sense of Babuska) that can compute an "-approximation with cost fi(c(d)(ln 1=") d ). Hence this finite element method is a nearly optimal complexity algorithm for d-dimensional elliptic problems with analytic data.

Reference-contexts: Since faster-than-polynomial growth is the hallmark of intractability (see, e.g., <ref> [6] </ref>), this means that elliptic boundary-value problems are intractable in the worst case setting for large dimension d, whenever the class F is the unit ball of a Sobolev space of fixed smoothness r.

Reference-contexts: For most problems that arise in practice, F is a space of functions defined on a d-dimensional domain. Most work on the computational complexity of such problems has assumed that F has been the unit ball of a Sobolev space H r , see, e.g., <ref> [13] </ref>. Suppose that the only information we have about any f 2 F is the values of a finite number of continuous linear functionals of f , and that the cost of each of these evaluations is c (d). <p> However, the nearly optimal complexity algorithm is a finite element method using only function evaluations. Hence, standard information consisting of function values is as powerful as arbitrary continuous linear information for our problem. This result should be contrasted to the results for spaces of fixed smoothness reported in <ref> [13] </ref>, in which we found that there was a heavy penalty associated with using function values instead of more general continuous linear functionals. 1 We choose the H m -norm mainly for the sake of specificity. <p> However, the usual reason for looking at error estimates in this norm is that it is equivalent to the natural energy norm for the problem. The reader wishing to find complexity estimates for other norms should consult the monograph <ref> [13] </ref>. 2 Here we use the widely-used classification of finite element methods that was introduced by Babuska and his colleagues: (1) h-methods, in which the degree of the finite element method is held fixed and the partition varies (these are the usual finite element methods), (2) p-methods, in which the partition <p> Problem description In what follows, we assume that the reader is familiar with the usual terminology and notations arising in the variational study of elliptic boundary value problems. See Chapter 5 and the Appendix of <ref> [13] </ref> for further details, as well as the references cited therein. Let BX denote the unit ball in the normed linear space X and let BX denote the elements in X whose norm is at most . <p> Then B is weakly coercive on H m 0 () iff the only v 2 H m 0 () for which B (; v) = 0 on H m 0 () is v = 0.
