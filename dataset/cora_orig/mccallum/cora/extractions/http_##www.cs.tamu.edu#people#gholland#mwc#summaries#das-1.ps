Abstract: We evaluate several routing protocols for mobile, wireless, ad hoc networks via packet level simulations. The protocol suite includes routing protocols specifically designed for ad hoc routing, as well as more traditional protocols, such as link state and distance vector, used for dynamic networks. Performance is evaluated with respect to fraction of packets delivered, end-to-end delay and routing load for a given traffic and mobility model. It is observed that the new generation of on-demand routing protocols use much lower routing load. However, the traditional link state and distance vector protocols provide, in general, better packet delivery and delay performance.

Reference-contexts: Our goal in this paper to address this inadequacy by a thorough performance study of several key protocols in the same framework to better understand their comparative merits and suitability for deployment under different scenarios. To this end we use an existing, packet level, routing simulator called MaRS <ref> [1] </ref> with added mobility modeling capability. A suite of ad hoc routing protocols is evaluated under varying mobility and traffic models. Traditional link state and distance vector protocols are included in the suite to provide a point of comparison. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. <p> Note that TORA, DSR, AODV and ZRP are the four protocols currently under study by the IETF MANET working group as candidate protocols for evaluation and standardization [17]. 3. Simulation Model A discrete event, packet-level, routing simulator called MaRS (Maryland Routing Simulator) <ref> [1] </ref> was used for comparative performance evaluation. MaRS is a flexible platform developed specifically for evaluation and comparison of network routing algorithms. MaRS was used previously for comparative evaluation of link-state and distance-vector routing protocols for the NSFNET T1 backbone network with the possibility of link failures [25].

Reference-contexts: If, as a result, a minimum distance to any neighbor changes, this process is repeated. This technique is the classical distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm <ref> [2] </ref>. Routing loops, both short-lived and long-lived, are possible in distributed Bellman-Ford. There is also a possibility of counting-to-infinity problem, where it takes a large number of update messages to detect that a node is unreachable [14].

Reference-contexts: We focus our attention on two distance vector protocols. The first, extended Bellman-Ford achieved good performance for stationary networks in earlier simulation studies [25].

However, SPF has a much higher routing load in the simulations. Most protocols benefit to some degree as the number of connections grow large.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction A mobile, ad hoc network <ref> [4] </ref> is an autonomous system of mobile hosts connected by wireless links. There is no static infrastructure such as base stations. If two hosts are not within radio range, all message communication between them must pass through one or more intermediate hosts that double as routers. <p> The primary motivation is that the shortest path protocols, either link-state or distance vector, take too long to converge and have a high message complexity <ref> [4] </ref>. Because of the limited bandwidth of wireless links, message complexity must be kept low. Also, potentially rapidly changing topology makes it important to find routes quickly, even if the route may be suboptimal [4]. Several new ad hoc routing protocols have been developed with this basic philosophy. <p> either link-state or distance vector, take too long to converge and have a high message complexity <ref> [4] </ref>.

Also, potentially rapidly changing topology makes it important to find routes quickly, even if the route may be suboptimal [4]. Several new ad hoc routing protocols have been developed with this basic philosophy. They, however, vary widely in characteristics. For example, some of these protocols are variations of distance vector routing. Some protocols explicitly maintain redundant routing paths so that alternatives are available when a route changes.

Reference-contexts: Interest has also been partly fueled by the recent IEEE standard 802.11 <ref> [5] </ref> that includes the MAC and physical layer specifications for wireless LANs without any fixed infrastructure. Routing protocols in packet-switched networks traditionally use either link-state or distance-vector routing algorithm [14]. Both algorithms allow a host to find the next hop neighbor to reach the destination via the shortest path.

Reference-contexts: In the event of network partitions, the protocol is able to detect the partition and erase all invalid routes. TORA is based, in part, on the classical work by Gafni and Bertsekas <ref> [7] </ref>, who consider a similar problem of maintaining a destination oriented directed acyclic graph (DAG) in the face of topological changes. A DAG is considered destination oriented, if for every node, there is a path to a given destination.

Reference-contexts: They typically work by increasing the amount of information exchanged between nodes or providing some sort of inter-nodal coordination.

In DUAL (Distributed Update Algorithm) <ref> [8] </ref> inter-nodal coordination is achieved via a technique known as diffusing computation. We focus our attention on two distance vector protocols. The first, extended Bellman-Ford achieved good performance for stationary networks in earlier simulation studies [25]. The second, DSDV [22], was specifically proposed for mobile, ad hoc networks.

Reference-contexts: The nodes within a zone is close to one another. Use of proactive routing is advocated within a zone and reactive routing across zones [10]. Cluster based routing, however, is not new. Quite a few cluster-based approaches have appeared in the past. See, for example, <ref> [24, 9, 16] </ref>. We have not yet included ZRP in our suite of protocols considered for evaluation because of a couple of reasons.

Reference-contexts: For example, some of these protocols are variations of distance vector routing. Some protocols explicitly maintain redundant routing paths so that alternatives are available when a route changes. Some recently proposed protocols use a reactive approach for route discovery and maintenance, instead of the more traditional, proactive approach <ref> [10] </ref>. In a reactive approach protocols are source initiated; routes are discovered and maintained on an as needed basis, thus circumventing large overheads of always maintaining routes between all possible source and destination pairs. The protocols are briefly reviewed in the following section. <p> On Demand Protocols Link state and distance vector protocols are primarily proactive protocols in the sense that routes are maintained to all potential destinations (possibly all nodes in the network) all the time, whether are not all such routes are actually used <ref> [10] </ref>. Route maintenance can be a large overhead because of a significant amount of route update traffic, especially for large networks. Reactive or on-demand protocols, on the other hand, create and maintain routes only on as needed basis. <p> But depending on the changes in topology this route may not always remain the shortest. 2.5. Other Protocols Several other protocols have appeared in literature for mobile, ad hoc networks. Zone routing protocol (ZRP) <ref> [10] </ref> is a zone or cluster based routing protocol that is a hybrid between proactive and reactive routing. It is targeted for very large networks and divides the network into zones or clusters of nodes. The nodes within a zone is close to one another. <p> It is targeted for very large networks and divides the network into zones or clusters of nodes. The nodes within a zone is close to one another.

The on-demand protocols suffer from sub-optimal routes as well as worse packet delivery fraction because of more dropped packets. However, they are significantly more efficient in terms of the routing load.

Reference-contexts: Such shortest path protocols have been successfully used in many dynamic packet switched networks. Prominent examples include use of link state protocol in OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) [18] and use of distance vector protocol in RIP (Routing Information Protocol) <ref> [11] </ref> for interior routing in the Internet. Even though, any such protocol would, in principle, work for ad hoc networks, a number of protocols has been specifically developed for use with ad hoc networks.

Reference-contexts: Note that TORA, described earlier is also partially reactive in the sense that route creation is initiated on demand. However, route maintenance is done on a proactive basis such that multiple routing options are available in case of link failures. DSR Dynamic source routing or DSR <ref> [12] </ref> uses a technique where the source of a data packet determines the complete sequence of nodes through which to forward the packet; the source explicitly lists this route in the packet's header.

Reference-contexts: Interest has also been partly fueled by the recent IEEE standard 802.11 [5] that includes the MAC and physical layer specifications for wireless LANs without any fixed infrastructure. Routing protocols in packet-switched networks traditionally use either link-state or distance-vector routing algorithm <ref> [14] </ref>.

In our simulation we used the SPF implementation of link state protocol as described in [25]. 2.2. <p> This technique is the classical distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm [2]. Routing loops, both short-lived and long-lived, are possible in distributed Bellman-Ford. There is also a possibility of counting-to-infinity problem, where it takes a large number of update messages to detect that a node is unreachable <ref> [14] </ref>. Several protocols have been proposed to avoid long-lived loop and counting to infinity problems. They typically work by increasing the amount of information exchanged between nodes or providing some sort of inter-nodal coordination. <p> It appears that the theoretical worst case communication complexity (number of messages required to adapt to a link failure/recovery) does not provide much insight into the average case behavior obtained via simulation. For example, SPF has a worst case communication complexity of O (2e) <ref> [14] </ref>, where e is the number of links in the network. On the other hand communication complexity in protocols based on distributed Bellman-Ford, such as EXBF and DSDV, is exponential in the number of nodes N in the network [3], which should be much higher.

Reference-contexts: Each node has a fixed radio range and has a link to every other node in the system. If the other node is not within range the link cost is infinity.

Each node is modeled by a store-and-forward, queueing station, and is characterized by parameters such as buffer space and processing speed. Each link is characterized by a bandwidth and propagation delay. A link is modeled as an FCFS queue with service time as the transmission time.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that DSDV avoids long-lived loops and counting to-infinity problems [22]. However, in our knowledge its performance has not yet been reported in literature. 2.3. Multipath Protocols - TORA The unique feature of the temporally ordered routing algorithm or TORA <ref> [20] </ref> is maintaining multiple routes to the destination so that many topological changes do not require any reaction at all, as having just a single route is sufficient. The protocol reacts only when all routes to the destination are lost. <p> However, this distance information is eventually lost during route maintenance phase. Since multiple routes are maintained in TORA, an obvious question is the choice of route. Two alternatives are suggested choosing a neighbor randomly so that the loads are more or less evenly distributed or choosing the lowest neighbor <ref> [20] </ref>. We have chosen the latter in our simulations. 2.4.

Reference-contexts: Also, routes can be improved by having nodes promiscuously listen to conversations between other nodes in proximity. AODV Ad hoc, on-demand distance vector protocol or AODV <ref> [21] </ref> is an on-demand variation of distance vector protocols. AODV uses destination sequence numbers like DSDV to determine freshness of routing information. In AODV, flooded requests are used to create route, with the destination responding to the first such request, much as in DSR.
