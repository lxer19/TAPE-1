Abstract: Scheduling is the problem of allocating resources to alternative possible uses over designated periods of time. Several have proposed (and some have tried) market-based approaches to decentralized versions of the problem, where the competing uses are represented by autonomous agents. Market mechanisms use prices derived through distributed bidding protocols to determine an allocation, and thus solve the scheduling problem. To analyze the behavior of market schemes, we formalize decentralized scheduling as a discrete resource allocation problem, and bring to bear some relevant economic concepts. Drawing on results from the literature, we discuss the existence of equilibrium prices for some general classes of scheduling problems, and the quality of equilibrium solutions. We present an ascending auction mechanism and bidding protocol for the basic scheduling formulation, and analyze its computational and economic properties. To remedy the potential nonexistence of price equilibria due to complementarities in preference, we introduce additional markets in combinations of basic goods. Finally, we consider direct revelation mechanisms, and compare to the market-based approach.

Such mechanisms operate in a variety of ways, typically calculating allocations and price quotes as a function of bids for all the combinations.

Theorem 1 For the general discrete resource allocation problem, if there exists a p such that f is in equilibrium at p, then f is an optimal solution. Proof. Bikhchandani and Mamer <ref> [3] </ref> and Gul and Staccheti [10] provide proofs for an exchange economy without reserve prices. A slight extension accounts for reserve prices. Let f be in equilibrium at prices p, and let f 0 be an alternative solution. <p> Proof. By Lemma 2, the single-unit scheduling problem always has at least one price equilibrium p. By Theorem 1, p supports an optimal solution. Since p supports an optimal solution, it can be shown that all optimal solutions must be supported by p <ref> [3, 10] </ref>. 2 Together, Theorems 1 and 3 establish that a solution to the single-unit scheduling problem is optimal iff it is supported by a price equilibrium. Example 2 demonstrates that relaxing the single-unit restriction immediately leads to the possibility that an equilibrium will not exist. <p> Bikhchan-dani and Mamer <ref> [3] </ref> present some other technical conditions for existence of 3 Note that preferences are not additive in the multiple-unit scheduling problem.

For the single-unit problem, such anticipation is unnecessary, as the agent would not wish to change its bid even after observing what the other agents did. This is called the no regret property <ref> [3] </ref>, and means that from the agent's perspective, no bidding policy would have been a better response to the other agents' bids. <p> The no-regret property does not hold, 12 Name Job Length Deadline Value Agent 1 2 2 $20 Agent 2 2 3 $8 Agent 3 1 3 $2 Table 2: A multiple-unit problem (Example 3). however, for the ascending auction in the multi-unit scheduling problem, regardless of the bidding strategy <ref> [3] </ref>. In general, an agent might perform better, for example, through accurate prediction of the other agents' behavior.

Reference-contexts: Thus the GVA can obtain optimality in problems for which a price equilibrium does not exist. The GVA is not a panacea. It is a DRM relying on dominant strategies in the class of Groves [9] and Clarke <ref> [4] </ref> mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: If self-interested agents are free to set their own priorities, then without some incentive to the contrary, they will specify maximum priority for whatever they are interested in. Citing such limitations, several have proposed that distributed resource allocation problems be solved via market mechanisms <ref> [5] </ref>, an approach we have called market-oriented programming (MOP) [37]. In MOP, we define agent activities in terms of resources required and produced, reducing an agent's decision problem to evaluating the tradeoffs of acquiring different resources. <p> Scheduling problems often exhibit complementarities and non-convexities, which violate the ideal conditions for the welfare theorems or for particular market protocols.

Reference-contexts: Proof. Demange et al. prove this result for the ascending auction protocol in an exchange economy where buyers want no more than a single item from a set of available goods <ref> [6] </ref>. In the single-unit scheduling problem, no agent wishes to obtain more than a single item, hence the result holds for this problem. 2 Consider again Example 5. The solution shown has a value of $16.

Reference-contexts: Green and Laffont have shown under rather general conditions that when agents have quasi-linear preferences, the only efficient social choice functions that are implementable in dominant strategies are those that are implementable by Groves-Clarke mechanisms <ref> [7] </ref>. However, such mechanisms are not always guaranted to be budget-balanced: they may require an outside injection of resources (subsidy). Further, even when a social choice function can be implemented with a budget-balanced Groves-Clarke mechanism, we cannot guarantee that rational agents will agree ex post to participate in the allocation.

Reference-contexts: More formally, if agents play Bayesian-Nash or dominant strategies, any desirable choice function that can be implemented by a mechanism can be implemented by a DRM. The Generalized Vickrey Auction (GVA) <ref> [32] </ref> is a direct revelation mechanism that can implement optimal allocations for a broad class of scheduling problems with multiple goods, multiple units, requirements contingencies, and externalities (i.e., values for one agent that depend on the allocations obtained by other agents). The GVA does not use a price system. <p> Theorem 12 If v j (F fl j ) + V j 0 and if P j (^v j ) is independent of agent j's reported preferences, then the GVA is incentive compatible. The intuition behind the proof <ref> [32] </ref> generalizes that of Vickrey's original result [33]. An agent receives v j (F fl j )+V j = v j (F fl j )+W j P j , from the value of its allocation and the payment from the auction.

Since scheduling problems very often involve discrete (indivisible) resource units, we have undertaken to analyze directly the behavior of computational market mechanisms for such problems. We start by defining a general class of discrete allocation problems, and characterizing some distinctions particularly meaningful in the scheduling domain.

Reference-contexts: Citing such limitations, several have proposed that distributed resource allocation problems be solved via market mechanisms [5], an approach we have called market-oriented programming (MOP) <ref> [37] </ref>. In MOP, we define agent activities in terms of resources required and produced, reducing an agent's decision problem to evaluating the tradeoffs of acquiring different resources. These tradeoffs are represented in terms of market prices, which define a common scale of value across the various resources. <p> In our own MOP work, we have adopted the framework of general equilibrium theory [18], and have found that our computational markets behave predictably when conditions of the theory are met <ref> [22, 37, 39] </ref>. We have also applied the approach to discrete optimization problems|where the conditions guaranteeing desirable outcomes are not satisfied|and have found (not surprisingly) that the methods sometimes work, and other times break down [36, 38].

Reference-contexts: Further, as Example 2 demonstrates, many scheduling problems cannot support allocations with any price equilibrium. In light of these limitations, several have proposed combinatorial auction mechanisms, where agents submit bids for combinations of goods <ref> [2, 15, 27, 29, 40] </ref>. Such mechanisms operate in a variety of ways, typically calculating allocations and price quotes as a function of bids for all the combinations. Price quotes may refer to individual goods, or to entire bundles.

Reference-contexts: One of the most important distinctions is whether an individual auction allocates a single resource, or several at once. The latter type, called combinatorial auctions (Section 7), accept bids referring to combinations of goods. We have implemented the Michigan Internet AuctionBot 4 <ref> [41] </ref>, a configurable auction server that implements a broad class of mechanisms, defined by a parametric characterization of auction design space. The AuctionBot provides interfaces for human and software agents to create and participate in auctions.
