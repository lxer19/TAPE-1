Reference-contexts: This idea of representing the adjacency relation on edges by an adjacency relation on vertices can be extended to capture various intersection relations amongst induced subgraphs in a graph. Indeed, one such generalization of line graphs has been studied by the present authors <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> the family L (G) of line graphs of simple graphs, Hedetniemi [4] obtained the fisc for the family L (B) of line graphs of bipartite graphs, Bermond and Meyer [2] established the fisc for the family L (G fl ) of line graphs of multigraphs, and Cai, Corneil and Proskurowski <ref> [3] </ref> provided the fisc for the family L (B fl ) of line graphs of bipartite multigraphs. A diagram summarizing the fiscs of these four families of graphs can be found in [3]. <p> fisc for the family L (G fl ) of line graphs of multigraphs, and Cai, Corneil and Proskurowski <ref> [3] </ref> provided the fisc for the family L (B fl ) of line graphs of bipartite multigraphs. A diagram summarizing the fiscs of these four families of graphs can be found in [3]. In light of the forbidden induced subgraph characterizations of these four families, it is natural to ask for which 2-pairs (X; Y ) do the (X; Y )-intersection graphs have fiscs and in particular, which 2-pairs generate L (G),L (G fl ),L (B) or L (B fl ). <p> Note that we may restrict our attention to hereditary pairs, since only for such pairs do (X; Y )-intersection graphs have fiscs. In fact, the present authors showed in <ref> [3] </ref> that these four families play a pivotal role in the study of hereditary 2-pairs. In particular 1 A copy of a graph H is an induced subgraph that is isomorphic to H. <p> We will also present three infinite families of L (B)-generators and L (B fl )-generators. Stable 2-Pairs and (X; Y )-Intersection Graphs 5 2 Preliminaries For this paper to be self-contained, we summarize in this section the definitions and results in <ref> [3] </ref> that will be used in this paper. To facilitate the study of (X; Y )- intersection graphs, the following notion was introduced in [3]: Definition 2.1 Given a 2-pair (X; Y ), the (X; Y )-containment multigraph of a graph G, denoted C X;Y (G), is a multigraph where 1. <p> Stable 2-Pairs and (X; Y )-Intersection Graphs 5 2 Preliminaries For this paper to be self-contained, we summarize in this section the definitions and results in <ref> [3] </ref> that will be used in this paper. To facilitate the study of (X; Y )- intersection graphs, the following notion was introduced in [3]: Definition 2.1 Given a 2-pair (X; Y ), the (X; Y )-containment multigraph of a graph G, denoted C X;Y (G), is a multigraph where 1. each vertex corresponds to a distinct copy of X in G, 2. each multiedge corresponds to a distinct copy of Y in G, and <p> It is easy to see that when (X; Y ) is a compact 2-pair, an (X; Y )-containment multigraph becomes an (X; Y )-containment graph. As observed in <ref> [3] </ref>, there is a fundamental relation between (X; Y )-containment multigraphs and (X; Y )-intersection graphs: Proposition 2.2 For any 2-pair (X; Y ) and any graph G, the (X; Y )-intersection graph I X;Y (G) of G equals the line graph L (C X;Y (G)) of the (X; Y )-containment <p> We also denote the family of bipartite graphs by B and the family of bipartite multigraphs by B fl . The following propositions are from <ref> [3] </ref>. Proposition 2.3 Let B be the body of a non-compact 2-pair (X; Y ). Then (X; Y ) realizes an arbitrary multigraph H iff (X; B) realizes the simple graph obtained from H by removing all duplicate edges.
