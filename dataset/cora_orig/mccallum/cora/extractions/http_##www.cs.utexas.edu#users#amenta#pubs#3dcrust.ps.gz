Title: Surface Reconstruction by Voronoi Filtering  
Author: Nina Amenta Marshall Bern 
Abstract: We give a simple combinatorial algorithm that computes a piecewise-linear approximation of a smooth surface from a finite set of sample points. The algorithm uses Voronoi vertices to remove triangles from the Delaunay triangulation. We prove the algorithm correct by showing that for densely sampled surfaces, where density depends on "local feature size", the output is topologically valid and convergent (both pointwise and in surface normals) to the original surface. We describe an implementation of the algorithm and show example outputs.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm relies on the well-known constructions of the Delaunay triangulation and the Voronoi diagram. This paper is an extension of previous work by Amenta, Bern, and Eppstein <ref> [1] </ref> on reconstructing curves in two dimensions. Our previous work defined a planar graph on the sample points called the "crust". <p> Our previous paper showed that both the crust and the fi-skeleton [23] (another empty-region planar graph) correctly reconstruct curves even with nonuniform sampling. Our two-dimensional results <ref> [1] </ref> are in this way strictly stronger than those of the other authors. 3 Description of the Algorithm We start by describing the algorithm of Amenta et al. [1] for the problem of reconstructing curves in IR 2 . <p> Our two-dimensional results <ref> [1] </ref> are in this way strictly stronger than those of the other authors. 3 Description of the Algorithm We start by describing the algorithm of Amenta et al. [1] for the problem of reconstructing curves in IR 2 . Let F be a smooth (twice differentiable) curve embedded in IR 2 , and S be a set of sample points from F . Let V denote the vertices of the Voronoi diagram of S. <p> Further notice that to prove an algorithm correct, we must place some condition on the set of sample points S, or else the original surface could be any surface passing through S. Our paper on curve reconstruction <ref> [1] </ref> proved the following theoretical guarantee. Theorem 1 (Amenta et al. [1]). If S is an r-sample of a curve in IR 2 for r :40, then the crust includes all the edges between pairs of sample points adjacent along F . <p> Further notice that to prove an algorithm correct, we must place some condition on the set of sample points S, or else the original surface could be any surface passing through S. Our paper on curve reconstruction <ref> [1] </ref> proved the following theoretical guarantee. Theorem 1 (Amenta et al. [1]). If S is an r-sample of a curve in IR 2 for r :40, then the crust includes all the edges between pairs of sample points adjacent along F . If S is an r-sample for r :25, then the crust includes exactly those edges. <p> The algorithm is simple enough to analyze, easy enough to implement, and practical enough for actual use. Our previous paper <ref> [1] </ref> gave two provably good algorithms for reconstructing curves in two dimensions, one using Voronoi filtering as in this paper, and the other using the fi-skeleton.

Reference-contexts: We used Clarkson's Hull program [12] for Delaunay triangulation, and Geomview [24] to visualize and print the results. We used vertices from pre-existing polyhedral models as inputs, in order to compare our results with "ground truth". A companion paper <ref> [2] </ref> reports on our experimental findings. The only tricky part of the implementation was the handling of degeneracies and near degeneracies. Our test examples, many of which started from approximately gridded sample points, included numerous quadruples of points supporting slivers.

Reference-contexts: The major drawback of using ff-shapes for surface reconstruction is that the optimal value of ff depends on the sampling density, which often varies over different parts of the surface. For uniformly sampled surfaces, however, ff-shapes are workable. Bernardini et al. <ref> [8] </ref> follow ff-shape-based reconstruction with a clean-up phase to resolve sharp dihedral angles. Edelsbrunner and Raindrop Geomagic [14] are continuing to develop ff-shape-based reconstruction along with proprietary extensions. An early algorithm due to Boissonnat [10] is related to ours.

Reference-contexts: Manifold learning is the problem of reconstructing a smooth k-dimensional manifold embedded in IR d . This problem arises in modeling unknown dynamical systems from experimental observations <ref> [11] </ref>. Even if Voronoi filtering can be generalized to this problem, its running time for the important case in which k t d would not be competitive with algorithms that compute triangulations only in k-dimensional subspaces [11], rather than in IR d . <p> This problem arises in modeling unknown dynamical systems from experimental observations <ref> [11] </ref>.

Along with the two theoretical open questions outlined above, there are several quite practical directions for further research on our algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The zero set of this function is then contoured by a continuous piecewise-linear surface using the marching cubes algorithm. A similar algorithm by Curless and Levoy <ref> [13] </ref> is tuned for data samples collected by a laser range scanner, but could be applied to the general reconstruction problem. Their algorithm sums anisotropi-cally weighted contributions from the samples to compute a signed distance function, which is then discretized on voxels to eliminate the marching cubes step.

Step 6 ensures that the reconstructed surface has the topology of the original surface; before this final step, the computed surface will resemble the original surface geometrically, but may have some extra triangles enclosing small bubbles and pockets.

Reference-contexts: Bois-sonnat's algorithm, however, overlooks the fact that even dense sample sets can give Delaunay tetrahedra with cir-cumspheres that are arbitrarily far from the medial axis; indeed it is this second observation which motivates our definition of poles.
