Abstract: Mechatronic automotive systems are hybrid systems. Modelling and simulation of the interactions between continuous and discrete parts is essential to evaluate dependability. In this paper we show how a simple mechatronic system can be modelled in the CPN formalism. Quantitative dependability evaluation is obtained thanks to Monte-Carlo simulation. We use the DesignCPN Occurrence Graph tool to validate the model and make a qualitative analysis of the system.

Reference-contexts: In both cases, the successive marking of the net can be represented by a Markov Chain and therefore, dependability will be evaluated analytically. Many dependability studies on computer systems use this method <ref> [FOT 97] </ref>. More generally, it may be useful to model state changes of a device that do not represent fault or repair process, but a change related to the regular behaviour of the system.

Reference-contexts: Delays related to repair and fault process are generally modelled by random variables with exponential distribution functions. A Petri Net containing only stochastic time delays is known as a Stochastic Petri Net <ref> [FLO 85] </ref>. If we allow immediate firing transitions (for synchronisation modelling), the model obtained is the Generalised Stochastic Petri Net. In both cases, the successive marking of the net can be represented by a Markov Chain and therefore, dependability will be evaluated analytically.

Reference-contexts: 1. MOTIVATION Mechatronic systems mix electric, mechanic, hydraulic and electronic technologies and use a computer control <ref> [GUY 94] </ref>. Some mechatronic systems like active suspension, automatic gear box, engine control, anti-skating system are already available on todays cars. The aim of the control system is to observe the operative part through physical variables measured by the sensors, and choose the suitable command processed by the actuators.

Reference-contexts: The architecture of a typical mechatronic system is given by Figure 1. In this article, we deal with discrete control processes only. In the early design stage of a new mechatronic system, designers have to deal with dependability evaluation <ref> [LER 92, HEN 96] </ref>. From a functional model, the Preliminary Risk Analysis identifies the events that lead to a catastrophic event, also called feared events . The fault tree method is then used for a qualitative and quantitative dependability evaluation.

Reference-contexts: The duration of the grace period depends on the dynamic of the operative part and the duration of a reconfiguration depends on the control system and actuators dynamics <ref> [MAR 96] </ref>. Today, tools for modelling and simulation of hybrid systems exist. The control part is modelled by means of Petri Nets or State Charts. The continuous part is generally modelled by differential algebraic equations.

Reference-contexts: Operative part (energetic system) Control and reconfiguration system (computer) Sensors Actuators Faults Control system Physical system A fault tree gives the Boolean conditions of occurrence of a feared event. These conditions are written in terms of elementary events, the faults of the basic components of the system <ref> [PAG 80] </ref>. Efficient algorithms and tools allow today to compute the feared event occurrence probability given the elementary event failure rates. But, this representation is static and does not take into account reconfigurations. <p> But, this representation is static and does not take into account reconfigurations. An alternative to the fault trees is to model the structural and functional interactions between the components of the system in the State Graph formalism <ref> [PAG 80] </ref>. The modelled states are the operating and fault states of the system. State graphs can describe any kind of finite discrete event system by enumerating the states, but the number of states grows drastically with the number of parallel activities generated by the system.
