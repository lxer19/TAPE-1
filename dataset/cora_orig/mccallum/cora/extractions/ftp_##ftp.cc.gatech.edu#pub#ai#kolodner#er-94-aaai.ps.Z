Abstract: Case-based reasoning (CBR) has a great deal to offer in supporting creative design, particularly processes that rely heavily on previous design experience, such as framing the problem and evaluating design alternatives. However, most existing CBR systems are not living up to their potential. They tend to adapt and reuse old solutions in routine ways, producing robust but uninspired results. Little research effort has been directed towards the kinds of situation assessment, evaluation, and assimilation processes that facilitate the exploration of ideas and the elaboration and redefinition of problems that are crucial to creative design. Also, their typically rigid control structures do not facilitate the kinds of strategic control and opportunism inherent in creative reasoning. In this paper, we describe the types of behavior we would like case-based design systems to support, based on a study of designers working on a mechanical engineering problem. We show how the standard CBR framework should be extended and we describe an architecture we are developing to experiment with these ideas. 1

Reference-contexts: It arises out of a confluence of processes (including problem redescription, remembering, assimilation, and evaluation), which interact with each other in complex ways. Often creativity arises from interesting strategic control of these processes, which in themselves may be quite mundane <ref> (Boden 1990, Chandrasekaran 1990, Gero & Maher 1993, Navinchandra 1992) </ref>. These processes rely heavily on previous design experiences and knowledge of designed artifacts (Goel & Chandrasekaran 1992, Hinrichs 1992, Kolodner & Pen-berthy 1990, Kolodner & Wills 1993).

Reference-contexts: This may include 1) aiding the formalization, reformu lation, and refinement of specifications (Reubenstein & Waters 1991, Johnson, Benner, & Harris 1993), 2) bringing up evaluative issues <ref> (Domeshek & Kolodner 1993) </ref>, 3) retrieving pending problem contexts to help recognize the applicability of solutions, or 4) proposing new control strategies. We are taking a case-based approach to understanding creative design for two reasons.

Reference-contexts: Evaluative issues emerge in the course of evaluating. Designers do not merely depend on constraints that have already been specified. Rather, they bring up additional constraints and criteria as proposals are examined. Proposed solutions often remind them of issues to consider. The problem and solution "co-evolve" <ref> (Fischer 1993) </ref>. One interesting criteria that emerged in the course of the ME design project was versatility the ability of the device to apply in more than one situation. This criteria was not mentioned or required in the original statement of the problem.

Reference-contexts: Navinchandra (1991) calls this criteria emergence and shows an example of how it can arise from case-based projection. In addition to criteria, constraints in general <ref> (Prab-hakar & Goel 1992) </ref> and relative priorities among them also gradually emerge. This type of evaluation is a key driving force within creative design, feeding back to situation assessment and guiding case manipulation. Assimilation.
