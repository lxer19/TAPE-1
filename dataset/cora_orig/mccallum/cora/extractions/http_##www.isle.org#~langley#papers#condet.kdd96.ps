Title: Induction of Condensed Determinations  
Author: Pat Langley 
Address: Stanford, CA 94305  
Affiliation: Robotics Laboratory, Computer Science Dept. Stanford University,  
Abstract: In this paper we suggest determinations as a representation of knowledge that should be easy to understand. We briefly review determinations, which can be displayed in a tabular format, and their use in prediction, which involves a simple matching process. We describe ConDet, an algorithm that uses feature selection to construct determinations from training data, augmented by a condensation process that collapses rows to produce simpler structures. We report experiments that show condensation reduces complexity with no loss of accuracy, then discuss ConDet's relation to other work and outline directions for future studies.

Reference-contexts: Second, they require some scheme for organizing search; our system takes a greedy approach, both for purposes of efficiency and to reduce chances of overfitting.
