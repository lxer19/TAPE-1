Abstract: Let B be a basis of transpositions for S n and let Cay(B :S n ) be the Cayley graph of S n with respect to B. It was shown by Kompel'makher and Liskovets that Cay(B :S n ) is hamiltonian. We extend this result as follows. Note that every transposition b in B induces a perfect matching M b in Cay(B : S n ). We show here when n &gt; 4 that for any b 2 B, there is a Hamilton cycle in Cay(B : S n ) which includes every edge of M b . That is, for n &gt; 4, for any basis B of transpositions of S n , and for any b 2 B, it is possible to generate all permutations of 1; 2; : : :; n by transpositions in B so that every other transposition is b.

Reference-contexts: Recently it has been shown that the Cayley graphs of Coxeter groups, generated by order two elements which are geometric reflections, are hamil-tonian <ref> [CoSlWi] </ref>. A related result is that for A n generated by the set of 3-cycles f (12n); (13n); : : : ; (1 n1 n)g, the Cayley graph is hamiltonian [GoRo]. 2 In this paper, we consider S n with any generating set of transpositions, X. <p> Clearly, there is no Eulerian cycle if n is odd. On the other hand, there does appear to be a x-alternating path in Cay (X : G) 20 if G is a reflection group and x is one of its generators, but we have not proven this fully. In <ref> [CoSlWi] </ref>, the Cayley graphs of reflection groups are shown to be Hamiltonian.

Reference-contexts: required consecutive permutations ff (1) (1) The remainder of the proof is identical to the proof of Theorem 2. 2 4 Final Remarks There have been some other papers written about finding Hamilton cycles through specified matchings in graphs, but not in connection with Cayley graphs (<ref> [Ha] </ref>,[Wo]). For example, Haggkvist [Ha] has shown that if d (u) + d (v) jV (G)j + 1 for all nonadjacent vertices u and v of G, then G has a Hamilton path through any given perfect matching.

Reference-contexts: The question remains open even when we require that every generator x 2 X satisfy x 2 = id. What is known is that for every generating set X of transpositions, the Cayley graph of S n is hamiltonian. This was first shown by Kompel'makher and Liskovets <ref> [KoLi] </ref>. Slater showed in [Sl] that one could always find a Hamilton path in Cay (X : S n ) which ended at a permutation with a j in position k for any j; k 2 [n]. <p> edges of the graph with the property that each vertex of Cay (X : S n ) is the end of exactly one edge in M x : M x = ffg; gxg j g 2 S n g: Knowing that Cay (X : S n ) is hamiltonian by <ref> [KoLi] </ref>, we can ask if M x extends to a Hamilton cycle. Such a cycle corresponds to a listing of all permutations of [n], in which successive permutations differ by a transposition in X, so that alternate transpositions correspond to the element x.

Reference-contexts: If we require only a Hamilton path, the question is still open and is, in fact, a special case of the more general conjecture of Lovasz that every connected, undirected, vertex transitive graph has a Hamilton path <ref> [Lo] </ref>. If we restrict our attention to the case when G = S n , the symmetric group of all permutations of [n] = f1; 2; : : : ; ng, it is still an open problem whether every Cayley graph of S n is hamiltonian.

Examples of posets in R include the odd fences, crowns, the Boolean algebra lattices, the lattices of subspaces of a finite-dimensional vector spaces over GF (q), and partition lattices. In [PrRu] it is proven that the linear extensions of any poset in R can be listed so that every extension differs by a transposition from its predecessor in the list.

Reference-contexts: Although they were able to show such a listing was always possible, in some cases the transpositions were not of elements in adjacent positions; these transpositions were the only ones in the proof that were nonadjacent. In <ref> [RuSa] </ref> we showed that it is possible to list permutations of [n] by adjacent transpositions so that every other transposition exchanges the elements in positions 1 and 2. See Figure 3 for an example when n = 5.
