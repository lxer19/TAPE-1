Reference-contexts: In (73) and (74), however, the phrase containing the bound pronoun is an unselected modifier. Assuming that modifiers are adjoined to the phrases they modify, they do not occur in the position of XP in (78). The adjunction prohibition <ref> (Chomsky 1986a) </ref> prohibits adjunction to an argument, therefore the PP in (73) and the CP in (74) must be adjoined to the NP complement of D, which is the complement of a functional head and not an argument.

Reference-contexts: The representations of referential and elliptical dependencies, and the model of ellipsis in which these will be cast, will be stated in terms of the principles and assumptions of Government and Binding Theory (GB) <ref> (Chomsky 1981, 1986a,b) </ref>. In GB, the input to the semantic component is a syntactic representation of Logical Form (LF) that is derived transformationally from S - structure. I thus assume a syntactic model of ellipsis interpretation, in which an elided VP is fully represented at LF. <p> The pronoun her is dependent on his , which is contained in the antecedent of her . By transitivity each pronoun is dependent on itself, in violation of (64). In addition, (64) rules out so - called i-within-i violations <ref> (Chomsky 1981) </ref>, which are exemplified by (66). (66) *[Every picture of its frame] was taken on Wednesday. The antecedent of the pronoun its is the DP containing it, therefore this pronoun is dependent on itself, in violation of (64).

Reference-contexts: In particular, I will assume that a DP in SpecIP that bears an outer index is interpreted as an operator, and the trace in SpecVP as the variable that it binds <ref> (cf. Diesing 1992) </ref>. As noted in 3.1, given the claim that the LF of an elided VP is identical to the LF of its antecedent, this requirement would seem to force coindexation of the subjects of elliptically related VPs.

Reference-contexts: Heim states that only definite DPs, pronouns, and traces bear inner indices. For the purposes of this paper, I will assume that indefinites may also bear inner indices, which, when bound by existential closure, introduce a discourse referent <ref> (cf. Heim 1982, Diesing 1992, and fn. 17 below) </ref>. <p> For the purposes of this paper, I will assume that indefinites may also bear inner indices, which, when bound by existential closure, introduce a discourse referent (cf.

Reference-contexts: The first is the relation that holds between an anaphoric element in an argument position and the linguistic element from which it receives an interpretation (its antecedent), a relation that I will refer to as referential dependence <ref> (cf. Higginbotham 1983, Hak 1985, 1987) </ref>. Intuitively, the interpretation of an anaphoric element is determined by the composition of its antecedent; hence an anaphoric element is dependent on anything contained in its antecedent. <p> The crucial difference between the analysis presented here and Hak's analysis is that, as noted in Hak (1985), (82) is a descriptive constraint-in a system that assumes a single referential dependence relation <ref> (as in Higginbotham 1983 and Hak 1987) </ref>, it does not follow that binding within XP should save structures like (73) and (74) from ill-formedness with respect to (64). <p> The processes that generate LFs from S-structures, which are outlined in Heim (1992) and which I have assumed in this paper, create structures in which all potential syntactic binders (i.e., DPs with outer indices at S-structure) become operators at LF <ref> (cf. Higginbotham 1983) </ref>. B-dependence is a formal statement of the relation between the variables that are bound in an operator's nuclear scope (by that operator) and the elements in the operator's restriction.

Reference-contexts: very similar to Sag's (1976) statement of VP Deletion; the main difference between this approach and Sag's is that (50) requires strict identity, whereas Sag required alphabetic variance of lambda expressions, a form of what I have referred to as loose identity. 10 I assume the VP internal subject hypothesis <ref> (Kitagawa 1986, Koopman & Sportiche 1988, Kuroda 1988) </ref>, and in particular, the VP structure defended in Huang (1993), in which the subject originates in SpecVP and moves to SpecIP to receive Nominative Case. Moreover, I assume SpecVP to be the position to which V 0 assigns its external theta role.

Reference-contexts: Subsequent analyses of VP ellipsis within the Extended Standard Theory have pursued the idea that identity can be stated in terms of a syntactic level of Logical Form (LF) <ref> (e.g., May 1985, Kitagawa 1991, Fiengo and May 1993) </ref>, while more purely interpretive approaches, in which the resolution of ellipsis is carried out completely in the semantic component, have followed Sag in stating identity in terms of logical expressions (e.g., Rooth 1981, Dalrymple, Shieber, & Pereira 1991). <p> Wasow's (1972) Empty Structures Hypothesis ). Both approaches shared the hypothesis that the conditions governing ellipsis were stated in semantic terms. Subsequent work in GB <ref> (e.g., May 1985, Chao 1988, Kitagawa 1991, Fiengo and May 1993) </ref> has assumed that the interface between the semantic component and the syntactic component occurs at a syntactic level of Logical Form (LF), which is derived transformationally from S - structure.

Reference-contexts: That is, the coindexed subjects bind all and only like-indexed anaphoric elements within their respective scopes; the interpretation of these anaphoric elements is governed solely by their binders, not by the numerical values of syntactic indices <ref> (Reinhart 1983, Heim 1992, Grodzinsky & Reinhart 1993) </ref>. <p> Heim's rule for interpreting colinked structures means that coindexation entails coreference: every occurrence of a particular free inner index must be associated with the same referent. Although there is nothing to prevent different inner indices from being associated with the same referent <ref> (as in Reinhart 1983) </ref>, it cannot be the case that the same free index is associated with different referents. To summarize, all inner indices correspond to free variables. <p> In most cases of ellipsis, the hypothesis that an elided VP is treated as identical to its antecedent does not have unexpected results, given a model of anaphoric relations such as Heim (1992) <ref> (or Reinhart 1983) </ref>. Because two distinct DPs may bind like-valued variables (by virtue of bearing identical outer indices)-modulo configurational restrictions such as ccommand-the strict identity analysis is indistinguishable from an analysis in which the indexical values of anaphoric elements within the VPs are allowed to vary.

Reference-contexts: The analysis proposed here will inherit any problems with such an analysis of strict/sloppy ambiguity <ref> (see Wescoat 1989 for some particularly problematic examples) </ref>, but this is not an issue that I will address. <p> First, the paper supports the theory of anaphoric relations developed in Heim (1992). Heim (1992:3) notes that her revision of Reinhart (1983) may share with Reinhart the "wrong descriptive generalizations" about ellipsis. Although I have avoided discussion of some of the problems associated with syntactic accounts of ellipsis <ref> (several of which are discussed in Wescoat 1989 and Dalrymple 1991) </ref>, I have shown that Heim's system allows us to implement an explicit representation of elliptical dependence via the strict identity hypothesis, and thereby give a precise account of a complex array of facts.
