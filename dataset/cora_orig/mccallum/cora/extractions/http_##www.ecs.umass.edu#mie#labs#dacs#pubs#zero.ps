Abstract: In this paper, we consider control systems utilizing so-called Clegg integrators. A Clegg integrator is a linear integrator with reset mechanism whose describing function 1:62 ! 6 38:1 ffi has magnitude slope equivalent to that of a linear integrator, but with 51 less degrees of phase lag. The potential advantages of using Clegg integrators to meet stringent design specifications has been demonstrated in the literature, however, stability analyses are missing. This paper addresses the zero-input stability of such control systems and provides a definitive stability condition for second-order plants as well as a providing preliminary results for higher-order plants.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction An integrator is an element found in every control engineer's toolbox helping to provide zero steady-state errors to constant exogenous signals. However, this benefit comes at the expense of 90 degrees of phase lag at all frequencies. The Clegg integrator was developed in <ref> [1] </ref> to reduce this phase lag while retaining the integrator's desirable magnitude slope frequency response. Indeed, the describing function of a Clegg integrator is 1:62 ! with magnitude slope equivalent to that of a linear integrator but with a smaller constant phase response of 38:1 ffi .

Reference-contexts: Thus, it seems that the Clegg integrator could potentially provide solutions to control problems involving limited classes of signals; namely sinusoids, with stringent design specifications by overcoming the limitations imposed by Bode's gain-phase relationship; see <ref> [2] </ref> and [3]. However, except for the sufficient conditions for oscillation and non-oscillation given in the general context of describing functions (e.g., see [5]), the problem of closed-loop stability for the Clegg integrator has not been addressed. The motivation for this paper is to give more definitive stability conditions.
