Reference-contexts: Another parameter space approach is the Hough transform, which was originally designed for the detection of straight lines in images. Subsequently it was extended to cover a number of geometric shapes, notably conic sections and Ballard <ref> [2] </ref> further extended the approach to arbitrary shapes with the Generalized Hough Transform. The parameter space for each model is divided into cells ("binned"), and then for each image feature a vote is added to each parameter space bin that could have produced that feature.

Reference-contexts: For example, Grimson's work [12] on matching polyhedral objects to models uses edge features; as every image feature can potentially match every object feature it is necessary to search the space of possible correspondences using an interpretation tree. Other authors [21], [19], [30], <ref> [3] </ref> have emphasized the grouping of lower-level image elements into higher level features. An alternative approach is to work directly in parameter space. A simple example of this can be found in [15], where Horn shows how to instantiate a model of a binary image using image 7 moments.

Reference-contexts: Our approach is to use a neural network to predict the instantiation parameters for each model, given an input image. Zemel and Hinton [29] used a similar method with simple 2-d objects, and more recently, Beymer et al <ref> [4] </ref> have constructed a network which maps from a face image to a 2-d parameter space spanning head rotations and a smile/no-smile dimension.

Reference-contexts: We estimated the weightings from the data by training a simple postprocessing neural network. These inputs are connected directly to the ten output units. The output units compete using the "softmax" function <ref> [6] </ref> which guarantees that they form a probability distribution, summing to one. II. Predicting the instantiation parameters The search procedure described above is very time consuming.

Reference-contexts: P (IjM ) ' P (z fl jM )P (Ijz fl ; M )(zjI; M ) (2) 2 This framework has been used by many authors, e.g. <ref> [11] </ref>. 4 By Taylor expanding around z fl to second order it can be shown that the volume factor depends on the determinant of the Hessian of log P (z; IjM ).

Reference-contexts: Using sufficient correspondences the instantiation parameters of the model can be determined. The problem is that simple, easily detectable image features have many possible matches, and more complex features require more computation and are more difficult to detect. For example, Grimson's work <ref> [12] </ref> on matching polyhedral objects to models uses edge features; as every image feature can potentially match every object feature it is necessary to search the space of possible correspondences using an interpretation tree.

Reference-contexts: An alternative approach is to use a fixed set of basis functions f i g, and to approximate the posterior distribution (or some function of it) by the linear combination P i a i (I) i (z) <ref> [14] </ref>. For example, the Hough transform uses indicator functions of the bins as basis functions, although it would be possible to use other classes of functions, e.g. Gaussians.

Reference-contexts: After collecting votes from all image features we then search for peaks in the parameter space accumulator array, and attempt to verify pose. The Hough transform can be viewed as a crude way of approximating the logarithm of the posterior distribution P (zjI; M ) (e.g. <ref> [16] </ref>, [24]). However, these techniques have only been used on problems involving rigid models, and are not readily applicable to the digit recognition problem.

Reference-contexts: However, it may be preferable to be able to represent a number of guesses about model instantiation parameters; one way of doing this is to train a network that has multiple sets of output parameters, as in the "mixture of experts" architecture of Jacobs et al <ref> [17] </ref>. The outputs can be interpreted as a mixture distribution in the control point position space, conditioned on the input image. The mixture of experts approach models the posterior distribution with a fixed number of Gaussians whose means, variances and mixing proportions are adaptive.

Reference-contexts: A. Splines, affine transforms and imaging models This section presents a brief overview of our work on using deformable models for digit recognition. For a fuller treatment, see <ref> [23] </ref>. Each digit is modelled by a cubic B-spline whose shape is determined by the positions of the control points in the object-based frame. The models have eight control points, except for the one model which has three, and the seven model which has five. <p> The natural measure is the sum of E fit , E def and the volume 3 It is also possible to let the EM algorithm effectively determine its own annealing schedule; this approach is described in <ref> [23] </ref>. 6 factor. However, we have found that performance is improved by including four additional terms which are easily obtained from the final fits of the model to the image.

Reference-contexts: With sufficient matches it is then possible to compute the instantiation parameters of the model. We have conducted some preliminary experiments with this method (described in <ref> [26] </ref>), which indicate that good performance can be achieved for the correspondence prediction task. constant. 13 We have shown that we can obtain significant speedup using the prediction net. The schemes outlined above which allow multimodal predictions in instantiation parameter space may improve performance and deserve further investigation.
