Abstract: This paper describes methodologies applied and results achieved in the framework of the ESPRIT Basic Research Action B-Learn II (project no. 7274). B-Learn II is one of the first projects working towards an application of Machine Learning techniques in fields of industrial relevance, which are much more complex than the domains usually treated in ML research. In particular, B-Learn II aims at easing the programming of robots and enhancing their ability to cooperate with humans. The paper gives a short introduction to learning in robotics and to the three applications under consideration in B-Learn II. Afterwards, learning methodologies used in each of the applications, the experimental setups, and the results obtained are described.
