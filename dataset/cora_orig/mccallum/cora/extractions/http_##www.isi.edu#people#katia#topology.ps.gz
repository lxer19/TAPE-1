Abstract: This paper describes a simulated annealing algorithm to compute k-connected graphs that minimize a linear combination of graph edge-cost and diameter. Replicas of Internet information services can use graphs with these properties to propagate updates among themselves. We report the algorithm's performance on 2- and 3-connected, 50-node graphs, where edge-cost and diameter correspond to physical distance in a plane. For these graphs, the algorithm finds solutions whose edge-cost and diameter are 10% and 70% lower than our graph construction algorithm that returns feasible but unop-timized solutions. When optimizing edge-cost only, the resulting graphs show 25 and 30% reductions edge-cost and diameter, respectively.

Reference-contexts: In our simulations, we evaluate complete graphs where the edge costs correspond to physical distance in the plane. Our Internet replication system <ref> [1] </ref> measures and estimates the end-to-end communication costs between nodes, which depends on network state, physical topology, and processing load at the nodes. The topology construction problem can be stated as follows.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper describes a simulated annealing algorithm to construct low diameter, low edge-cost, 2- and 3-connected graphs. We need graphs with these properties to propagate updates between replicas of Internet information systems <ref> [2] </ref>. For maintaining replicas across the Internet, we use connectivity of 2 or 3 for resiliency, low edge-cost so the physical network is used efficiently, and low diameter to limit transient replica inconsistency.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, instead of having to check connectivity between all N 2 =2 pairs of nodes, we only need to check the connectivity of kN pairs of nodes, where k is typically 2 or 3. To check an individual node's connectivity we apply the Ford-Fulkerson maximum flow algorithm <ref> [3] </ref> which computes the number of disjoint paths between a source and a sink in O (N E 2 ). <p> Choosing p to emphasize edge costs, results in higher diameter graphs; choosing p to emphasize diameter, results in graphs with more and possibly more expensive edges. We compute diameter using Dijkstra's all-pairs shortest-path algorithm <ref> [3] </ref> at cost O (N E log N ). 3 Results This section summarizes experiments we conducted to evaluate the performance of the algorithm presented in the last section. Recall that this algorithm requires a connectivity requirement k as well as an edge-cost matrix of the topology.

Reference-contexts: For maintaining replicas across the Internet, we use connectivity of 2 or 3 for resiliency, low edge-cost so the physical network is used efficiently, and low diameter to limit transient replica inconsistency. Since any algorithm that minimizes edge cost or diameter in 2 or greater connected networks is NP-complete <ref> [4] </ref>, we employ simulated annealing [7] to search for approximate solutions. The algorithm presented here simultaneously reduces both edge-cost and diameter by 10 and 70%, respectively, over unoptimized, feasible solutions.

Reference-contexts: Recall that this algorithm requires a connectivity requirement k as well as an edge-cost matrix of the topology. We evaluated our algorithm using random graphs generated by NTG <ref> [5] </ref>, a network topology generator. Links were of three different bandwidths; nodes were placed in an x-y plane, with higher density towards the periphery of the plane; and all nodes had the same degree.

Reference-contexts: Johnson [6] proves that constructing a subgraph which connects all vertices and minimizes the shortest path cost between all vertex pairs, subject to a budget constraint on the sum of its edge-costs, is also NP-complete. Schumacher <ref> [10] </ref> provides an algorithm for generating topologies which have minimum number of edges, are k-connected and have minimum diameter. However, his method assumes that all the edges have equal weights. We cannot make that assumption since our problem is to build peer-to-peer topologies over real networks.
