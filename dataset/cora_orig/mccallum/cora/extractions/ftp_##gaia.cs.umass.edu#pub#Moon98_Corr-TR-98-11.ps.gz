Abstract: Technical Report 98-11 Department of Computer Science January 1998 Abstract In this paper we examine the correlation between packet delay and packet loss experienced by a continuous-media traffic source on the Internet. Our goal is to study the extent to which one performance measure can be used to predict of the future behavior of the other (e.g., whether observed increasing delay is a good predictor of future loss) so that an adaptive continuous media application might take anticipatory action based on observed performance. We ran numerous hour-long experiments in which continuous media traffic was sent from a source to a destination. We measured the per-packet delay and packet loss and then analyzed our measurements off-line. Our results provide a quantitative study of the extent to which such correlation exists. Interestingly, we observe periodic phenomena in the correlation that we had initially not expected. We discuss our results, speculate as to the reason for the observed behaviors, and discuss their implications for adaptive continuous media applications.

Reference-contexts: Packet losses in continuous-media applications, whether from late arrivals or dropped packets, degrade the quality perceived at the receiver. Applications can choose to ignore lost packets or recover from them via retransmission [PP96] or via receiver-based error recovery/masking <ref> [BG96] </ref>. Continuous media applications can be not only loss-adaptive, but delay-adaptive as well. That is, they can have either a fixed playout time, or adapt to changes in packet delay and set the playout time accordingly [RKTS94].

Reference-contexts: Packets may be dropped or delayed at routers along a source-to-destination path as a result of network congestion. There are efforts to change this best-effort service paradigm in the Internet to provide integrated service for different types of applications <ref> [Wro97, SPG97, CW97] </ref>. Given today's best-effort Internet service (or even alternate service models such as differential service or controlled load service in which performance is not guaranteed), however, continuous media applications will continue to suffer impairments due to varying packet loss and network delay within a connection.

Reference-contexts: First, the utilization level of the congested link fluctuates severely. When the link is congested, packets are dropped, and when 8 the link is under-utilized, the bandwidth is wasted. RED (Random-Early Detection) has been proposed to address this lock-out phenomenon of synchronization <ref> [FJ93] </ref>. We plan to run simulations of the RED queue management to test if it breaks down the synchronization, and if correlation is no longer detectable by our measure of loss-conditioned average delay. We note that the traces we took can be used in a trace-driven IP voice simulator.

Reference-contexts: We can guess about the causes of the observed oscillatory behavior, but we can not be sure. If it indeed results from synchronization among other TCP sources, can we validate our claim using simulations? As part of our second year project, we plan to use ns <ref> [ns97] </ref> as a simulation tool, run several TCP sources with a UDP source through one common bottleneck link, and see if we observe similarly correlated behavior between delay and loss as in our traces. The synchronized behavior among sources is not desirable in several respects.

Reference-contexts: Another issue to be considered is routing. If packets are routed through different paths to the destination, the resulting delays and losses at the destination come from different queues in the network. This would complicate our analysis of correlation between losses and delays. A recent study by Paxson <ref> [Pax97] </ref> suggests that route changes can be detected by out-of-order deliveries of packets (although out-of-order packets do not necessarily imply a route change). In his traces, less that 1% of packets were delivered out of order.

Reference-contexts: Continuous media applications can be not only loss-adaptive, but delay-adaptive as well. That is, they can have either a fixed playout time, or adapt to changes in packet delay and set the playout time accordingly <ref> [RKTS94] </ref>. Such adaptive applications keep track of packet delays, and reflect any change in packet delays in their calculation of playout time. Given the above discussion, it is clear that packet loss and delay have tremendous impact on continuous 2 media applications.
