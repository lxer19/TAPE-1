Title: Fast and Accurate Computation of Polyhedral Mass Properties  
Author: Brian Mirtich 
Address: Berkeley  
Affiliation: University of California at  
Abstract: The location of a body's center of mass, and its moments and products of inertia about various axes are important physical quantities needed for any type of dynamic simulation or physical based modeling. We present an algorithm for automatically computing these quantities for a general class of rigid bodies: those composed of uniform density polyhedra. The mass integrals may be converted into volume integrals under these assumptions, and the bulk of the paper is devoted to the computation of these volume integrals. Our algorithm is based on a three step reduction of the volume integrals to successively simpler integrals. The algorithm is designed to minimize the numerical errors that can result from poorly conditioned alignment of polyhedral faces. It is also designed for efficiency. All required volume integrals of a polyhedron are computed together during a single walk over the boundary of the polyhedron; exploiting common subexpressions reduces floating point operations. We present numerical results detailing the speed and accuracy of the algorithm, and also give a complete low level pseudocode description.

Our approach is closest to that of Lien and Kajiya, who give an algorithm for computing integrals over arbitrary nonconvex polyhedra, based on a B-rep [6]. It is O (n) in the polyhedron complexity, and fairly easy to code.

Reference-contexts: Rigid body dynamics can be computed more efficiently with a reduced set of mass parameters, based on a body frame. Computing the body frame amounts to diagonalizing the inertia tensor, a classical problem of linear algebra. The Jacobi method <ref> [8] </ref> works quite well for this application since J is real, symmetric, and of moderate size. 3 Overview of volume integration Equations (4-11) show that all required mass properties can be found from ten integrals over volume, for each of the individual polyhedral components.
