Reference-contexts: We have proposed that the XAP/1 approach could be effectively extended to planning with subassemblies by using the subassembly tree model of an assembly plan and by building up such plans with three types assertions: sequencing assertions, trajectory assertions, and subassembly assertions <ref> [1] </ref>. This report provides a formal basis for that approach. It provides a formal definition of an subassembly tree plan and of the proposed assertions. <p> Our interest is in a structure we have called a subassembly tree representation of an assembly plan. The advantages of this structure are outlined elsewhere <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Thus there must exist two parts with the desired property for any subassembly. 2 8 2.4 Assertions It has been proposed that three types of assertions be used to describe subassembly tree plans <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Plans must be chosen which are geometrically feasible and which minimize set-up and production costs. Several experimental assembly planning systems have been developed to date. The XAP/1 assembly planner utilized a flexible and efficient approach to plan generation, but was unable to generate plans using subassemblies <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. We have proposed that the XAP/1 approach could be effectively extended to planning with subassemblies by using the subassembly tree model of an assembly plan and by building up such plans with three types assertions: sequencing assertions, trajectory assertions, and subassembly assertions [1].

Reference-contexts: We will then define the three types of assertions that we have proposed for use in the planner. 2.1 Subassembly Tree Plans There have been three different definitions of an assembly plan used in the literature <ref> [4] </ref>. Our interest is in a structure we have called a subassembly tree representation of an assembly plan. The advantages of this structure are outlined elsewhere [1].
