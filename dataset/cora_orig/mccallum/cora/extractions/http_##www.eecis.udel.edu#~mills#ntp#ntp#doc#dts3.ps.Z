Abstract: This report describes and compares three timekeeping systems in objectives, architecture and design. These systems are: Digital Time Synchronization Service (DTSS), Probabilistic Clock Synchronization (PCS) and Network Time Protocol (NTP), which have been submitted to the standards bodies as the basis of an international standard. Each of the three can be used to synchronize local clocks in a computer network with distributed and diversified services.
