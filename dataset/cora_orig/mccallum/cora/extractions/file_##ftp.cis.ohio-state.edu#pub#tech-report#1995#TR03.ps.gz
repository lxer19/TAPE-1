Title: Error-Bounded and Adaptive Image Reconstruction

Note: Submitted to SIGGRAPH95.  
Abstract: Reconstruction is imperative whenever an image needs to be resampled as a result of transformation such as an affine or perspective transform, or texture mapping. We present a new method for the characterization and measurement of reconstruction error . Our method, based on spatial domain error analysis, uses approximation theory to develop error bounds. We provide, for the first time, an efficient way to guarantee an error bound at every point by varying filter size. We go further to support position-adaptive and data-adaptive reconstruction which adjust filter size to the location of reconstruction and the data in its vicinity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with 1D and 2D examples.

Reference-contexts: When 2D images are subjected to affine transformations (e.g., translation, scaling, rotation) or when they are subjected to non-affine grid deformation (perspective, texture mapping, warping <ref> [1] </ref>), the function value in the form of pixel intensity has to be computed on the target grid, commonly called the resampling grid.

Reference-contexts: All of these methods make assumptions about the interpolated function, and they deliver filters which perform well on smooth functions. On the other hand, Carlbom <ref> [2] </ref> uses frequency methods to design f il-ters which are solutions of a nonlinear optimization process. This yields a f ilter of finite length whose frequency response closely approximates the ideal filter response. Among these efforts only [2] considers reconstruction error. <p> On the other hand, Carlbom <ref> [2] </ref> uses frequency methods to design f il-ters which are solutions of a nonlinear optimization process. This yields a f ilter of finite length whose frequency response closely approximates the ideal filter response. Among these efforts only [2] considers reconstruction error. However, this error is defined in the frequency domain and only measures the deviation of the frequency spectrum from the ideal spectrum (a box in frequency domain). Also, this metric is global in nature and does not provide error control on a point-wise basis.

Reference-contexts: This gives us an efficient yet accurate resampling method. There is a body of work dedicated to f iltering in texture spaces which attempts to address the issues of error control and adaptivity. Fournier and Fiume <ref> [3] </ref> use spatial methods and a least square error (L 2 norm) estimate (with data included) to guide ef ficient and accurate antialiasing of textures. They also allow adaptive filtering in a manner to similar to MIP maps.

Reference-contexts: We can show this by f irst considering the denominator sin (pz/h), where z=x+jy is any point in the complex plane. It is true that (24) The numerator in Equation 21 for all contours is bounded by E f cosh (pr|y|/h) <ref> [5] </ref>. Since the cosh function grows faster than the sinh function [18] for the same argument, on contours C 1 and C 3 in the limiting case the numerator becomes zero. Now let us consider contours C 2 and C 4 .

Reference-contexts: Similarly, reconstruction is also needed when a 3D image (volume [9]) is subjected to affine transformations (e.g., translation, scaling, or orthographic ray casting [23]), or non-affine transformations (e.g., perspective ray casting <ref> [8] </ref>, warping [4][6], and registration). 2.1 Ideal Reconstruction Much has been written about the reconstruction of sampled datasets in signal processing (1D data) [15] or image processing applications (2D data) [7][22].

Reference-contexts: The processing order of the axes is important and can determine the final quality of the image. Although separable filters are fast and easily implemented, separability introduces anisotropic effects since the 2D or 3D separable f ilter is aligned with the principal axes <ref> [13] </ref>. Anisotropic effects are always present unless a radially symmetric filter is employed. <p> The resulting filter has frequencies beyond w c which have nonzero strength. Also, some frequencies below w c have an attenuated amplitude less than the amplitude of the ideal filter. The resulting error has been called postaliasing by Mitchell and Netravalli <ref> [13] </ref>. <p> In [17], Parker et al. compare the ef fectiveness of some resampling filters.

Another body of work on the same problem is available in the applied mathematics literature [19], where the process is usually referred to as interpolation. <p> To minimize the impact of truncation, a window function besides a rectangle can be used. Among the most popular window functions are: triangular (Bartlett), Hanning, Hamming, and Kaiser <ref> [15] </ref>. These window functions alter the characteristics of the truncated frequency spectrum. The choice of one window function over another is a tradeoff between blurring and aliasing. However, since these filters differ from the Sinc function, a further source of error is introduced. W e call it the non-Sinc error. <p> Therefore, another function suitably modulated by a window can be used. We however need to estimate the error that arises from the use of windowed function. Once again we can either use the spectral energy or the maximum value of the function. Using Parsevals Theorem <ref> [15] </ref> and Equation 22 one can write (29) The integral computes the dif ference between the two functions in the L 2 norm space. The quantity E f (M) is the energy of the signal in a 2M+1 sized neighborhood around the resampling point R.

In <ref> [17] </ref> similar observations are made. However, these observations were made in the frequency domain. Also, the error was not quantified. An important implication from this observation is that one can use filters of different lengths depending on the location of the resampling point.

Reference-contexts: In fact, such a methodology has been used to estimate the error of Leg-endre and Hermite Polynomial interpolation. The mainstays of this approach are theory of analytic functions and the application of Cauchys Integral Formula and Residue Theorem <ref> [18] </ref>. 3.1.1 Results from Complex Analysis Inherent to this approach is the use of a contour C or a directional closed path in the complex plane. Such a contour is shown in Figure 2. <p> The intuition behind using the contour is that it generalizes the process of filtering to the complex plane. The contour C is the equivalent to the filter used to reconstruct real valued signals and could be of any shape. However, it needs to be closed and directional <ref> [18] </ref>. The rectangle is normally chosen given its simplicity. We now state Theorem 1 which provides us with a way to compute the error bound for f iltering interpolation schemes. <p> In this section discussion is to applicable to the space of continuous functions and we therefore use the symbol everywhere. Many of the concepts expounded herein can be found in any standard text on Complex Analysis including <ref> [18] </ref>. Theorem 1: Let C be the contour (shown in Figure 2) over the domain D (a subset of the complex plane) and let function f be analytic everywhere therein (i.e., it is defined every where and all derivatives exist). <p> By using other functions for G (z) we can determine the error for various function approximations. Proof: The starting point of this proof is the Cauchy Integral Formula <ref> [18] </ref> which allows us to compute the function f 1 (x) follows (18) As mentioned earlier, the integral is performed on a contour C (Figure 2). <p> It is true that (24) The numerator in Equation 21 for all contours is bounded by E f cosh (pr|y|/h) [5]. Since the cosh function grows faster than the sinh function <ref> [18] </ref> for the same argument, on contours C 1 and C 3 in the limiting case the numerator becomes zero. Now let us consider contours C 2 and C 4 .

Equation 3 readily provides this perspective, since the contribution at point x is the weighted sum of Sinc functions indexed by k. Also, at the sampled data locations the right-hand side of Equation 3 evaluates to the original function value. <p> This relationship is a direct consequence of the Cardinal Series Expansion <ref> [19] </ref>. All the sampled data points are included in the summation of Equation 22. . (22) We now state and provide a sketch of the proof of Theorem 2 which expresses the truncation error bound in terms of the spectral energy of the function.

Reference-contexts: However , the adaptivity is not driven by any user defined error threshold, but is guided by an ad-hoc measure of the robustness of the filtering operation in the frequency domain. Adaptive filtering in the frequency domain is also reported by T otsuka and Levoy <ref> [20] </ref> for 3-D volumes. Again, the adaptivity is not driven by an error threshold. Also, the technique requires that the filtering be conducted in the frequency domain, which requires transforming a lar ge 3D dataset.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, this bound overestimates the error since it does not take into account the oscillating nature of the Sinc function. We now consider some tractable error bounds that can be used in practice. The error bound for this inf inite sum can be found by resorting to complex analysis <ref> [24] </ref>. However, before we state the relevant results we discuss an important idea of frequency guards. Frequency guard bands allow the approximation of the infinite sum in Equation 15 by the integral of an analytic function which exists on the real line.
