Reference-contexts: (cancelable and variable) meaning, a distinction important for computational lexicons. 4.2 Resource acquisition for natural language processing Parallel corpora are increasingly of interest in natural language processing, with applications in cross-language information retrieval (Hull and Oard, 1997), machine translation (e.g. (Brown et al., 1990)), in approaches to word sense disambiguation <ref> (Brown et al., 1991) </ref>, and in computational lexicography (Melamed, 1996b) .

Reference-contexts: Plato's Apology approximates the size of Paul's Romans or 1 Corinthians" (Porter, 1989). As a resource for research using corpus-based statistical methods in computational linguistics, the Bible is small by current standards (e.g. see <ref> (Church and Mercer, 1993) </ref>); with some variation 1 for language and translation, it is typically on the order of 800,000 words and 4-5 megabytes.

Reference-contexts: The resulting data were used for a theoretical separation between the semantic (uncancelable) and pragmatic (cancelable and variable) meaning, a distinction important for computational lexicons. 4.2 Resource acquisition for natural language processing Parallel corpora are increasingly of interest in natural language processing, with applications in cross-language information retrieval <ref> (Hull and Oard, 1997) </ref>, machine translation (e.g. (Brown et al., 1990)), in approaches to word sense disambiguation (Brown et al., 1991), and in computational lexicography (Melamed, 1996b) .

Reference-contexts: version, accented characters will of course be encoded according to SGML conventions; here they are left in a simpler form for readability. 6 3.2 Target Format For our target annotation format, we are aiming for verse-level annotation of structure conforming to the Corpus Encoding Standard (CES) subset of the TEI <ref> (Ide, 1996) </ref>. In many respects, creating a parallel corpus from multiple versions of the Bible is an excellent match for the CES.

Reference-contexts: However, this is on the order of some monolingual corpora widely used for corpus-based research, such as the Brown Corpus of American English <ref> (Kucera and Francis, 1967) </ref>, and the breadth across multiple languages offers an opportunity for research not generally available with the larger corpora in use today. 2.2 Availability Originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek between 1000 B.C. and 100 A.D., the Bible is the world's most translated book.

Reference-contexts: Similar care is taken in the introduction of new translations: a recent attempt to introduce gender neutral language in the New International Version (NIV), last revised in 1983, met with a great outcry in some segments of the population, leading the publisher to abandon the project <ref> (LeBlanc, 1997) </ref>. Translations in established languages, therefore, tend to be conservative. And first translations in a given language are subject to rigorous scrutiny at every stage. We may therefore be confident that the texts we have are as accurate as humanly possible.

Reference-contexts: useful results, e.g. (Resnik and Melamed, 1997), and although its content is more specialized than, say, contemporary newspaper text, it does cover a very wide range of linguistic phenomena and domains of world knowledge; for example, see the range of conceptual categories in the Louw-Nida thesaurus for the New Testament <ref> (Louw and Nida, 1989) </ref>. 11 We plan to investigate parallel versions of the Bible as a possible resource for bootstrapping natural language resources, especially for work in machine translation, first by applying the techniques described by Resnik and Melamed for extracting and assessing word correspondences, and then using techniques for identifying

Reference-contexts: For example, we expect that encoding speech data will present similar problems. The basic structural element in conversational speech is the turn (e.g. see the Child Language Data Exchange System database, <ref> (MacWhinney, 1991) </ref>, which contains transcripts of conversations), and like verses, turns may comprise material both below and above the level of the sentence. 3.3 Input Formats Within a particular electronic version of the Bible, we have observed that data formats are fairly consistent.

Reference-contexts: However, the consistent verse-level alignments provide appropriate training material for algorithms that learn to do lower-level alignments on the basis of correctly aligned text, e.g. <ref> (Melamed, 1996a) </ref>, and can also be used as a source of test material for algorithms that attempt to produce sentence-level alignments. The structure inherent in the Bible also eliminates some problems of omissions in parallel text.

Reference-contexts: computational lexicons. 4.2 Resource acquisition for natural language processing Parallel corpora are increasingly of interest in natural language processing, with applications in cross-language information retrieval (Hull and Oard, 1997), machine translation (e.g. (Brown et al., 1990)), in approaches to word sense disambiguation (Brown et al., 1991), and in computational lexicography <ref> (Melamed, 1996b) </ref> . However, corpora reliably aligned at the word or even the sentence level are difficult to obtain even for commonly found language pairs, and for "low density" languages those for which few resources exist parallel corpora are even mopre difficult to find.

Reference-contexts: In our initial pass through the annotation process (see below), we are labeling elements as b (book), c 9 Special issues arise in automatically creating translation lexicons that include non-compositional pairs. See, e.g. <ref> (Melamed, 1997) </ref> and Section 4.2. 10 hhttp://www-rali.iro.umontreal.ca/TransSearch/TS-simple-uen.cgii 5 (chapter), and v (verse), producing an intermediate representation that captures the major struc-tural levels without conforming to any particular DTD. <p> Although it is not the largest of corpora, parallel corpora of significantly smaller size have yielded useful results, e.g. <ref> (Resnik and Melamed, 1997) </ref>, and although its content is more specialized than, say, contemporary newspaper text, it does cover a very wide range of linguistic phenomena and domains of world knowledge; for example, see the range of conceptual categories in the Louw-Nida thesaurus for the New Testament (Louw and Nida, 1989). <p> 1989). 11 We plan to investigate parallel versions of the Bible as a possible resource for bootstrapping natural language resources, especially for work in machine translation, first by applying the techniques described by Resnik and Melamed for extracting and assessing word correspondences, and then using techniques for identifying multi-word units <ref> (Melamed, 1997) </ref>. We also plan to evaluate the coverage of the Bible with respect to vocabulary and conceptual content by comparing it with existing lexicons for interlingual machine translation (Dorr, To appear; Dorr and Olsen, 1997) and thesauri such as WordNet (Miller, 1990).

In particular, we would like to compare the translation lexicons we create to bilingual lexicons automatically acquired by other means. (We have available to us Spanish-English and Arabic-English, with Korean-English in process, with other projects planned (Dorr, To appear)).
