Abstract: We introduce a convergence diagnostic procedure for MCMC which operates by estimating total variation distances for the distribution of the algorithm after certain numbers of iterations. The method has advantages over many existing methods in terms of applicability, utility, computational expense and interpretability. It can be used to assess convergence of both marginal and joint posterior densities, and we show how it can be applied to the two most commonly used MCMC samplers; the Gibbs Sampler and the Metropolis Hastings algorithm. Illustrative examples highlight the utility and interpretability of the proposed diagnostic, but also highlight some of its limitations.
