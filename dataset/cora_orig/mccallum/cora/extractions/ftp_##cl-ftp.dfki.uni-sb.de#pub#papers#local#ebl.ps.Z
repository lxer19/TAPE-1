Reference-contexts: An EBL system derives justified generalizations from training instances on the basis of declarative background knowledge. As a method, EBL 1 performs four different learning tasks: generalization, chunking, operationalization and justified analogy <ref> [1] </ref>. In the context of natural language processing, the declarative grammar (and the lexicon) serves as the background knowledge. The parser takes over the task of the problem solver. For a single sentence, the obtained derivation tree is interpreted as a justified explanation for the training instance.

Reference-contexts: Currently, various lines of research are pursued to compensate for this deficiency and to obtain a better performance. Among these are compilation into lower level formats for which more efficient algorithms exist (e.g., <ref> [2] </ref>, who investigates the compilation of hpsg into Tree Adjoining Grammar), or strategies which allow the attachment of control information determining the order of evaluation to constraints , e.g., [8]. In this paper we describe a different approach which is based on explanation-based learning.

Reference-contexts: Then EBL also would be applicable for processing of input independently of the length of the strings, as long as the string can be processed using the recursive templates. In <ref> [3] </ref> we give a more detailed description of this extension and its relevance for linguistic theories and natural language systems.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the paradigm of feature-based grammar formalisms and theories, one line of research has been oriented towards developing high level languages which are based exclusively on constraint specifications and which allow grammar writers to specify different levels of linguistic abstraction in one homogeneous data structure. In hpsg <ref> [4] </ref>, currently one of the most prominent member of this class of formalisms the constraint-based view leads to a very schematic representation of universal and language specific linguistic principles.

Reference-contexts: In the next section we discuss briefly the relationship between explanation-based learning and natural language processing. Our approach is described in detail in sections 3 to 5. In section 6 we relate our approach to other approaches, namely with that of <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. In section 7 we shortly outline some possible extensions of our approach. 2 Explanation-based Learning and Natural Language Processing Explanation-based learning (EBL) is a technique by which an intelligent system can learn by observing examples. <p> not affect run-time behaviour very much, because the main overhead is only caused by a slightly more complex retrieval of the discrimination tree and because templates can be stored more economically. 6 Related Work The basic idea for applying EBL in the context of natural language systems is due to <ref> [5] </ref> and [6]. The major difference to our approach is that they construct grammar rule chunks instead of keeping track of the original (generalized) derivation trees. These chunks consist of the root node and the yield of a previously analysed derivations, i.e., they abstract away all intermediate derivations.

Reference-contexts: This is easily achieved by inserting for each (in-termediate) derivation a corresponding inactive edge. If the parser uses an agenda for sorting inactive edges according to a given priority function (see e.g., <ref> [7] </ref>), and if inactive edges with wider span are given higher priority than those with a smaller span, the parser would try to combine the largest derivations before smaller ones, i.e., it would prefer those structures determined by EBL.

In this paper we describe a different approach which is based on explanation-based learning. Rather than modifying the grammar sources or controlling the constraint evaluation process, this approach allows the automatic extraction of sublanguages from a competence base and its application within a natural language system.

Reference-contexts: Although the storage of such expanded template is larger than its unexpanded counterpart, instantiation during AM reduces to simple pattern matching. 5 5 Implementation The simple approach is fully implemented and integrated into the natural language system disco <ref> [9] </ref>. disco uses a large hpsg grammar specified in TDL, a high level description language for typed feature 4 This is also the case if a complete analysis of a string is required for which the EBL module could successfully instantiate one or more templates.
