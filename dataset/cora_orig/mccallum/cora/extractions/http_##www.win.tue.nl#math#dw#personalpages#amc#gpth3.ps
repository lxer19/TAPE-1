Reference-contexts: What is the type of its symmetry group? Exercise 1.6.9. Determine the symmetry group of the N 4 P 4 -molecule, depicted in Figure 1.7. Concluding this section, we wish to point out that most examples came from <ref> [1] </ref>, although the pictures are our own. 1.7 The Three-dimensional Crystallographic Point Groups In crystals, atoms vibrate about equilibrium positions. The symmetry group H of the set of these positions contains a translation group corresponding to a three-dimensional lattice.
