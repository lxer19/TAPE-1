Title: How to Find Mathematics on a Scanned Page  
Author: Richard J. Fateman 
Address: Berkeley  
Affiliation: University of California,  
Abstract: We describe the design of document analysis procedures to separate mathematics from ordinary text on a scanned page of mixed material. It is easy to observe that the accuracy of commercial OCR programs is helped by separating mixed material into two (or more) streams, with only conventional non-math text handled by the usual OCR text-based heuristic analysis. The second stream, consisting of material judged to be mathematics, can be fed to a specialized recognizer. If that fails to decode it, it can be passed on to yet a third stream including diagrams, logos, or other miscellaneous material, perhaps including halftones. We explore the extent to which this separation can be automated in the context of scanning archival material for a digital library project including mathematical and scientific journal material.

Reference-contexts: For example, superscripts are either unrecognized or pushed down to the baseline. An integral sign may be ignored or viewed as an S. For some purposes, a better response is to provide only an image of a math section, treating it as analogous to a diagram or half-tone image <ref> [4] </ref>. Yet another alternative, assuming the component characters can be identified correctly might be to consider constructing a small section of PostScript. This would be less sensitive to degradation in re-rendering at different scales. This is not necessarily a realistic goal for high accuracy. <p> The next step in sequence, and higher in expense is probably finding connected components and judging the likelihood of mathematics being present by the arrangement of bounding boxes <ref> [4] </ref>. This level of processing seems to be helpful in finding text strings when they appear within graphics, as in maps or engineering drawings. Approximately collinear components of appropriate sizes and spacing are assumed to be text characters, without regard to actual bit-patterns.

Reference-contexts: In our target domain of scientific journals, most pages are mixtures. Given this mixture we might be to identify mathematics on a page by rough analysis akin to zoning <ref> [5] </ref>, or image signal processing [10]. These approaches do not, in our opinion, show much promise: some mathematics, especially in-line material, is rather indistinguishable from ordinary language at the level of texture.

They separate out "isolated" mathematics (we would call this "display" math), by its word-box statistics: higher boxes, separated by more than the usual paragraph spacing. There are good first-cut heuristics, but make mistakes: titles are labelled as formulas.

Reference-contexts: The text bag includes all Roman letters, Italic numbers. The math bag includes punctuation, special symbols, Italic letters, Roman digits, and other marks (horizontal lines, dots), etc. In figures 2 and 3 we show corresponding sections of a small excerpt of a paper <ref> [9] </ref>. Figure one has the initial contents of the math bag, and figure 2 the text. Superimposed two-color illustrations are sometimes more useful in understanding the relationships of the components. * Group the math bag components into zones according to proximity. This is a very sensitive, and potentially error-introducing operation. <p> or alternatively, collect the sections and store them as GIF or similar image formats. * Collect the two sets of results and combine them as a description of the page. 9 Example Figures 2 and 3 are extracted from column 2 of page 4 of a paper on economic modeling <ref> [9] </ref> from our digitized electronic library collection 8 . We found that for the whole page, the math-bag contained 684 elements, 207 of them dots over i, j, i, j, or dots in colons or semicolons. By merging these dots together early, subsequent processing is likely to be faster.
