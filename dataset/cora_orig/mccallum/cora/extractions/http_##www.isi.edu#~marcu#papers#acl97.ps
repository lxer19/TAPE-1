Title: The Rhetorical Parsing of Natural Language Texts  
Author: Daniel Marcu 
Address: Toronto, Ontario Canada M5S 3G4  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Toronto  
Abstract: We derive the rhetorical structures of texts by means of two new, surface-form-based algorithms: one that identifies discourse usages of cue phrases and breaks sentences into clauses, and one that produces valid rhetorical structure trees for unrestricted natural language texts. The algorithms use information that was derived from a corpus analysis of cue phrases.

Reference-contexts: We address now each of these objections in turn. Sentential and discourse usages of cue phrases. Empirical studies on the disambiguation of cue phrases <ref> (Hirschberg and Litman, 1993) </ref> have shown that just by considering the orthographic environment in which a discourse marker occurs, one can distinguish between sentential and discourse usages in about 80% of cases.

Reference-contexts: Lastly, we present the rhetorical parser and an example of its operation (section 4). 2 Foundation The mathematical foundations of the rhetorical parsing algorithm rely on a first-order formalization of valid text structures <ref> (Marcu, 1997) </ref>. The assumptions of the formalization are the following. 1. The elementary units of complex text structures are non-overlapping spans of text. 2. Rhetorical, coherence, and cohesive relations hold between textual units of various sizes. 3. Relations can be partitioned into two classes: paratactic and hypotactic. <p> Once the textual units are determined, the rhetorical parser uses the procedures derived from the corpus analysis to hypothesize rhetorical relations between the textual units. A constraint-satisfaction procedure similar to that described in (Marcu, 1996) then determines all the valid discourse trees (see <ref> (Marcu, 1997) </ref> for details). The rhetorical parsing algorithm has been fully implemented in C++. Discourse is ambiguous the same way sentences are: more than one discourse structure is usually produced for a text. <p> And the Microsoft Office 97 summarizer recalled 41% of the important sentences with a precision of 39%. We discuss at length the experiments from which the data presented above was derived in <ref> (Marcu, 1997) </ref>. The rhetorical parser presented in this paper uses only the structural constraints that were enumerated in section 2. <p> In contrast, Sumita et al. use deep syntactic and semantic processing techniques for determining the markers and the textual units and use sentences as minimal units in the discourse structures that they build. A detailed comparison of our work with Sumita et al.'s and others' work is given in <ref> (Marcu, 1997) </ref>. 5 Conclusion We introduced the notion of rhetorical parsing, i.e., the process through which natural language texts are automatically mapped into discourse trees.
