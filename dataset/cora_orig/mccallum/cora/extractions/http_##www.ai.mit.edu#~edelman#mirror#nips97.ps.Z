Abstract: Nearest-neighbor correlation-based similarity computation in the space of outputs of complex-type receptive fields can support robust recognition of 3D objects. Our experiments with four collections of objects resulted in mean recognition rates between 84% (for subordinate-level discrimination among 15 quadruped animal shapes) and 94% (for basic-level recognition of 20 everyday objects), over a 40 ffi fi 40 ffi range of viewpoints, centered on a stored canonical view and related to it by rotations in depth. This result has interesting implications for the design of a front end to an artificial object recognition system, and for the understanding of the faculty of object recognition in primate vision.

Reference-contexts: experiments using simple cells only or non-normalized Euclidean distance resulted in respective recognition rates of 35% and 17% (see Figure 4). 4 DISCUSSION The degree of invariance to rotation in depth that we found for general objects is comparable to that exhibited by human subjects in naming and recognition experiments <ref> (Biederman, 1987) </ref>. Because of the difficulty to control for prior exposure to such objects, a more informative comparison is the one involving the geon trees; these constituted novel stimuli both for our model, and for the subjects of (Tarr et al., 1997).
