Title: Assuring Security and Privacy for Digital Library Transactions on the Web: Client and Server Security Policies

Abstract: Often an information source on the Web would like to provide different classes of service to different clients. In the autonomous, highly distributed world of the Web, the traditional approach of using authentication to differentiate between classes of clients is no longer sufficient, as knowledge of a client's identity will often not suffice to determine whether a client is authorized to use a service. In [CJW96] we proposed the use of digital credentials to help solve this problem; but their use will in turn introduce a bevy of new problems associated with credential management. In this paper we propose the use of server security policies and client credential submission policies to aid in the management of a client's digital credentials. We propose a structure for such policies, and briefly describe an implementation of personal security assistants and server security assistants that embodies our proposed approach.

Reference-contexts: In the long run, a better approach is to place personal security assis-tants on the `smart cards' <ref> [ABKL91, Ved92, KCCT94] </ref> that all clients will probably possess one day, to be carried around with the client. As a second drawback, personal security assistants are on the network and thus are vulnerable to attack from outside, as well as attacks from other clients using the same computer.

Reference-contexts: The design of authentication protocols and structures which more directly support non-identity-based authorization policies is still an open field. The proposal in <ref> [AT83] </ref> is in the general direction we desire, with a key management scheme in which the possession and use of cryptographic keys by an individual reflects the individual's position in a military-style lattice of privilege groups, rather than an "identity" associated with the individual.

Reference-contexts: Mandatory preregistration might reduce the potential client base for a service.

However, in general this requires the SSA to analyze its own proof trees to determine the source (s) of failure of a proof that a client was authorized for the requested service, or else to describe what successful proof trees look like at the leaf level.

Reference-contexts: This allows the use of standard languages such as KQML to query knowledge bases, as well as easy export of policy information from servers to clients. Easy interchange also requires conventions about the representations used for certain common information; recommendations for such shared ontologies <ref> [CYC96, Gru91, Gru93, III95, KSL96b] </ref> are outside the scope of this paper. Also, although a general-purpose standard language like KIF is needed for export of policies, servers with very simple policies might prefer to use a more efficient and less flexible representation of their policies for internal reasoning.

Reference-contexts: For this reason, it will be wise to avoid resending credentials with subsequent service requests. This can be accomplished through the use of server `cookies' to retain state across interactions with a client [Net96], as long as mechanisms such as SSL <ref> [FKK96] </ref> are used to prevent forgery or tampering of cookies in transit and encryption is used inside each cookie to prevent the client from forging its contents. <p> This means that security cannot be implemented solely by software operating at a low system level, such as SSL <ref> [FKK96] </ref>, and that additional mechanisms are needed to allow specification of application- and user-specific security-related policies.

Reference-contexts: However, preregistration of clients runs counter to the spirit of many Web-based services, where clients often enter a small service request on the spur of the moment. Mandatory preregistration might reduce the potential client base for a service. To overcome these problems, in <ref> [JCW95] </ref> we presented desiderata for and in [CJW96] we recommended the use of digital credentials, which may be thought of as on-line analogues to the paper credentials that people carry in their wallets. <p> Our proposed scheme allows traceability if multiple information sources collude to share what they know about the different identities possessed by individuals. More exploration of the tradeoffs between different kinds of credentialing schemes can be found in <ref> [JCW95] </ref>. Not surprisingly, there has been a flurry of proposed authorization models specifically tailored for Web hypertext. For example, NCSA's Web server has for years allowed access control lists to be placed in directories.

Reference-contexts: This authentication step can take place as the credentials are submitted. Authentication can be accomplished using current well-known techniques and software, ranging from the primitive (and insecure) approach of supplying a password, through more modern public/private key approaches such as PEM <ref> [Ken93] </ref> and PGP [Zim94]. <p> As mentioned in Section 2, issues relating to the authentication of individuals must also be considered in conjunction with the question of authorization. As pointed out in [NBBH90], successful authentication provides the basis and warrant for subsequent access control. Widely-used authentication protocols today, such as PEM <ref> [Ken93] </ref>, depend upon an available means for establishing the binding between a name used for an individual and a cryptographic key used to protect (transmission of) data to and from that individual.

Reference-contexts: To represent policies and credential contents internally inside of personal security assistants and server security assistants, one approach is to use a knowledge representation language that is based on mathematical logic and allows efficient (polynomial-time) reasoning, e.g., KIF <ref> [KSL96a] </ref> restricted to one of the Horn clause dialects that allows efficient computation of answers to all queries (e.g., Datalog). This allows the use of standard languages such as KQML to query knowledge bases, as well as easy export of policy information from servers to clients.

To summarize the techniques and major issues, first, public/private key encryption can be used to prove that a credential was actually issued by its purported issuer.

Reference-contexts: In the long run, higher-level mechanisms are needed to ease client policy specification and maintenance. One approach would be to support logical groupings of documents, as has been proposed for servers (see discussion of <ref> [SBJ96] </ref> in Section 6). However, it might be difficult or overwhelming for clients to obtain the logical groupings used by servers, and server reorganizations could still create important gaps in policy coverage and intent. Another approach is to base the policies on attributes possessed by servers, rather than on URLs. <p> Under this approach, users must authenticate to the identity given in the access control list before they can see the documents stored in that directory on the Web server. The most sophisticated approach to hypertext authorization proposed so far is that of <ref> [SBJ96] </ref>, which recognizes that documents may have internal structure. Under their approach, the pre-defined structure of a document allows different access controls to be placed on different pieces of the document, with special attention given to embedded hyperlinks.
