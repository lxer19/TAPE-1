Abstract: One of the most effective form of reuse in OO technology is the framework. The pattern language introduced in the paper tries to capture some design and architectural patterns that reoccurs while constructing OO frameworks. The pattern language is based on a different perspective, regarding frameworks as a tool for developers. A framework is mainly a product for developers used as an integrated development environment that facilitates, supports, guides, confines, and helps the developers in building application in a well defined domain. A framework is an environment built to reduce development costs, maintenance costs, and implementation costs. An OO framework is a product for developers who specially use OO constructs and methods like abstractions and specialization, interfaces, contracts, classes, and objects. OO frameworks can support both implementations and design reuse.
