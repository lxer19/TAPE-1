Abstract: Discovering repetitive, and functional substructures in large structural databases improves the ability to interpret and compress the data. However, scientists working with a database in their area of expertise often search for predetermined types of structures, or for structures exhibiting characteristics specific to the domain. This paper presents a method for guiding the discovery process with domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, the Subdue discovery system is used to evaluate the benefits of using domain knowledge to guide the discovery process. Results show that domain-specific knowledge improves the search for substructures which are useful to the domain, and leads to greater compression of the data. Empirical and theoretical results also indicate the scalability of the algorithm to increasingly large structural databases.

Reference-contexts: To associate a measure between a pair of graphs consisting of a given substructure and a subgraph of the input graph, we begin with the inexact graph match given by Bunke and Allermann <ref> [1] </ref>. In this inexact match approach, each distortion of a graph is assigned a cost. A distortion is described in terms of basic transformations such as deletion, insertion, and substitution of vertices and edges.

Reference-contexts: Hence, in order to trade off between domain-independent and domain-dependent discovery methods, we incorporate domain knowledge into the Subdue system, and combine both the domain-independent and domain-dependent methods to guide the search toward more appropriate substructures. A variety of approaches to discovery using structural data have been proposed (e.g., <ref> [2, 6, 9, 10] </ref>). Many approaches use a knowledge base of concepts to classify the structural data.

Reference-contexts: Many reported discovery tools are also computationally expensive and cannot scale easily to large databases, especially those containing structural information. Recently, we introduced a method for discovering substructures in structural databases using the minimum description length (MDL) principle <ref> [3] </ref>. The system is called Subdue, and it discovers substructures that compress the original data and represent structural concepts in the data. Once a substructure is discovered, the substructure is used to simplify the data by replacing instances of the substructure with a pointer to the newly discovered substructure. <p> Iteration of the substructure discovery and replacement process constructs a hierarchical description of the structural data in terms of the discovered substructures. This hierarchy provides varying levels of interpretation that can be accessed based on the specific goals of the data analysis <ref> [3] </ref>. Although the MDL principle is useful for discovering substructures that maximize compression of the data, scientists often employ knowledge or assumptions of a specific domain to guide the discovery process. A domain-independent discovery method is valuable in that the discovery of unexpected substructures is not blocked. <p> By defining such a limit, significant speedup can be realized at the expense of accuracy for the computed match cost. A complete description of the inexact graph match procedure used by Subdue is provided by Cook and Holder <ref> [3] </ref>. 5 Adding domain knowledge to the SUBDUE sys tem The Subdue discovery system was initially developed using only domain independent heuristics to evaluate potential substructures. As a result, some of the discovered substructures may not be useful and relevant to specific domains of interest.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the domains described here, Subdue has been used successfully with and without domain knowledge in a number of other domains including databases of program source code, NASA satellite images, Chinese character databases, and the Brookhaven protein databases <ref> [4] </ref>. 7 Scalability A topic of critical importance in data mining is the scalability of the developed algorithms. In this section we address the issue of scalability of the Subdue system.

Reference-contexts: However, much of the data that is collected is structural in nature, or is composed of parts and relations between the parts. Hence, there exists a need to develop scalable tools to analyze and discover concepts in structural databases <ref> [5] </ref>. Many reported discovery tools are also computationally expensive and cannot scale easily to large databases, especially those containing structural information. Recently, we introduced a method for discovering substructures in structural databases using the minimum description length (MDL) principle [3].

Reference-contexts: Therefore, a typical row in the adjacency matrix will have much fewer than v 1s, where v is the total number of vertices in the graph. We apply a variant of the coding scheme used by <ref> [7] </ref> to encode bit strings with length n consisting of k 1s and (n k) 0s, where k t (n k). In our case, row i (1 i v) can be represented as a bit string of length v containing k i 1s.

Reference-contexts: For example, the instances of the substructure in Figure 1 are shown in Figure 2. 3 Substructure discovery using the MDL principle The minimum description length (MDL) principle introduced by Rissanen <ref> [8] </ref> states that the best theory to describe a set of data is a theory which minimizes the description length of the entire data set. The MDL principle has been used for decision tree induction, image processing, concept learning from relational data, and learning models of non-homogeneous engineering domains.
