Title: Using the OPT Improvement Approach in the SQL/DS Development Environment  
Author: Carolyn B. Seaman 
Affiliation: University of Maryland  
Abstract: This paper 1 presents the results of an exploratory case study in which the OPT method was applied to a real software development environment. The OPT method is an iterative software development improvement process. It is specifically aimed at organizational structures and development processes. The steps include modeling the relationship between the organization and the process, measuring various properties of this relationship, and choosing organizational and process changes that will satisfy a set of goals and constraints. Applying OPT to the IBM Software Solutions Toronto Laboratory SQL/DS 2 project demonstrated that this method helps to clarify issues that arise in the design of software development organizations and processes. Specifically, OPT made it possible to refine general improvement goals and to identify specific changes to be made to the environment to fulfill these goals. This paper summarizes the OPT approach and presents results from the SQL/DS case study. 1 The IBM contact for this paper is John Botsford,

Reference-contexts: The improvement cycle will be outlined in this section. The modeling techniques and metrics will be described in the context of the case study in the next section. See [4] for a more detailed explanation. The OPT improvement cycle is based on the Quality Improvement Paradigm (QIP) <ref> [1] </ref>, an iterative, goal-driven framework for continuous improvement of software development. Like the QIP, OPT is a closed-loop improvement cycle. The purpose of each iteration is to identify effective organizational and process changes with respect to a set of improvement goals.
