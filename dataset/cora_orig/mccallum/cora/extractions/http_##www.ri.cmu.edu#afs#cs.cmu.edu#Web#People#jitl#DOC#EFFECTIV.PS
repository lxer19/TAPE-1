Abstract: A ``Just-In-Time Lecture'' is a low-cost, flexible technology for creating and presenting educational material to groups and individuals. A review of learning concepts and education research supports the notion that Just-In-Time Lecture technology should be as effective as traditional classroom instruction. This finding is based on (1) a large body of research on related technologies, including television and videodisc training, (2) the fact that classroom instruction translates directly to the Just-In-Time Lecture medium, (3) the applicability of Just-In-Time Lectures to a variety of skill categories (e.g. Bloom's taxonomy), and (4) positive experience using Just-In-Time Lectures at two universities for classroom and individual instruction.

Reference-contexts: Among educational researchers, there are widely-known principles relating to how people learn effectively. A summary of these principles is that people learn by doing <ref> [Anderson 85] </ref>. It is therefore a simple extension from this principle to deduce that people learn most effectively when their environment causes them to have continuous high levels of interaction with the instruction system and performance.

Reference-contexts: P. L. Beare's study from Moorhead State University states: 4 ``... individual instructional formats had little effect on student achievement or course evaluation. ... the lack of individual opportunity to interact on a daily basis with the instructor did not reduce student learning ...'' <ref> [Beare 89] </ref> Moore and Kearsky sum up many results nicely: ``Comparing the achievement of learners (as measured by grades, test scores, retention, job performance) who are taught at a distance and those taught in face-to-face classes is a line of research going back more than 50 years.

Reference-contexts: Further, with the provision of freedom to investigate concepts in any order, including the possibility for human interaction and individualized attention, Just-in-Time Lectures can be created to provide any level of measurable performance according to such de facto educational standards as Bloom's taxonomy <ref> [Bloom 56] </ref>. At present, there are no formal studies specifically on the effectiveness of Just-In-Time Lectures. However, there is a growing body of experience and a wealth of studies and literature on related topics which point to the effectiveness of our approach.

Reference-contexts: information that they did not know before the course? Are they able to perform a new task, or have they improved their ability to perform an already known skill? In short, is there evidence that suggests that the instruction enabled them to do something new, differently, or better than before? <ref> [Capell 95] </ref> 2. Just-in-Time Lectures While lectures in and of themselves are not considered an excellent way of imparting knowledge, Just-in-Time Lectures (JITL) offer features that are not characteristic of traditional, linear, non-interactive instruction systems. These features are as follows and include the ability of the learner to: 1.

Reference-contexts: Just-In-Time Lectures have addressed skills at each level of Bloom's taxonomy and a related system has addressed psycho-motor skills <ref> [Dannenberg 90] </ref> , but it is natural to ask whether the technology is more suited to some levels than others. Although the answer may seem obvious, it is very difficult to control the quality-of-design factor when courses are adapted from one medium to another.
