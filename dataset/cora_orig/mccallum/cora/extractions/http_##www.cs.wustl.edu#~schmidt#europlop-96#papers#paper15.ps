Abstract: This paper describes an object composition technique based on the idea of connecting objects together using explicit relation objects. Problem domain objects are not represented by single objects, but by groups of mutually related objects. This design pattern treats groups of objects as if the groups were single objects, and provides a structure that allows the total behavior of the groups to be defined. The composition technique is flexible and especially useful in interactive systems where problem domain objects are constructed interactively.
