Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 309 Abbreviated version appears in Fifth International Conference on Computer Vision, Pp. 624-630, Cambridge MA, 1995 Abstract A new method for representing and recognizing human body movements is presented. Assuming the availability of Cartesian tracking data, we develop techniques for representation of movements based on space curves in subspaces of a phase space. The phase space has axes of joint angles and torso location and attitude, and the axes of the subspaces are subsets of the axes of the phase space. Using this representation we develop a system for learning new movements from ground truth data by searching for constraints which are in effect during the movement to be learned, and not in effect during other movements. We then use the learned representation for recognizing movements in data. Prior approaches by other researchers used a small number of classification categories, which demanded less attention to representation. We train and test the system on nine fundamental movements from classical ballet performed by two dancers. The system learns and accurately recognizes the nine movements in an unsegmented stream of motion.

Reference-contexts: For the work here we assume that three-dimensional position of some body points are available and the goal is to recognize the ballet steps from that data. Our system uses a commercially available system <ref> [3] </ref> to provide video-rate 3D data of approximately 20 markers attached to a human body. Our specific task is to learn and identify a set of nine atomic ballet movements from the XYZ tracking data.

Reference-contexts: shown, the body parameters considered are joint angles for 1DOF joints (e.g. knee), Euler angles for 3DOF joints (e.g. hip), torso orientation, and body-height-normalized torso height above the floor plane. 4.2 Representation considerations Aspects of the general representation problem are discussed in Marr and Nishihara [21] and Badler and Smoliar <ref> [4] </ref>. Marr and Nishihara consider representations of three dimensional shapes for object recognition and present three criteria: accessibility, scope and uniqueness, and stability and sensitivity. These criteria, however, are as relevant to recognizing motions and we evaluate our representation in light of these considerations.

Reference-contexts: Correlations come in two types: always true, e.g. laws of physics or math, and true when an item is a member of a category. This latter type is for classification <ref> [6] </ref>. The learning method tries to find correlations between variables which occur during a move. But how to find the second kind of correlations which are useful for categorization? Our technique is to minimize a weighted sum of false acceptances and false rejections of a predictor.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Until recently, computer vision analysis of image sequences focused predominantly on issues of geometry, either the three-dimensional geometry of a scene or the geometric motion of a moving camera (see [18] for review). Lately, however, there has been an effort at getting computers to understand action or behavior <ref> [7] </ref>. In this paper we present a technique for recognizing human motion in domains in which there are clearly defined semantic categories of movement.

Reference-contexts: There are 8 arm positions in the Cecchetti school, six in the French, and four in the Russian. There is more freedom for the arms to be expressive and to take a range of positions, and not all arm positions occur with all steps <ref> [14, 32] </ref>. The practice steps are interesting because they tend to be simple movements with one degree of freedom which are pieces of the more complex movements. Thus they are a sort of syllable or phoneme of dance and we call them atomic movements.
