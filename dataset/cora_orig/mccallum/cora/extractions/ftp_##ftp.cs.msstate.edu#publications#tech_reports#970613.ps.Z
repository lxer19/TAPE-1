Reference-contexts: We will conduct sensitivity analyses to determine how sensitive our Bayesian network prototype is to changes in probability values. 7. Ease of implementation. Several development programs are now available for implementing Bayesian networks including the Hugin package that we have used for development of the prototypes in our work <ref> (Andersen et al. 1989) </ref>. 4.4 Fuzzy Logic Fuzziness is related to quantified degrees of knowing . We can think of it as a representation of vagueness. It allows us to represent classifications that include vagueness and degree. Unlike uncertainty, fuzziness is not related to degree of belief and probabilities.

Reference-contexts: A more detailed description of each of the methods and the prototypes that were developed for matrix identification are given in Bridges et al. (1997). 4.1 Certainty Factors The certainty factors (CF) approach to representing uncertainty in an expert system was originally developed for the MYCIN expert system <ref> (Buchanan and Shortliffe 1990) </ref>. In the CF approach, each hypothesis made by the system (example: Evidence is consistent with graphite in the container) and each piece of evidence considered by the system (example: The technician thinks RTR indicates graphite in the container) has a certainty factor associated with it. <p> This certainty factor indicates a degree of belief in that hypothesis (given all the evidence considered so far) or a degree of belief in that piece of evidence. The certainty factor values are usually obtained from domain experts, not from direct observation <ref> (Buchanan and Shortliffe 1990) </ref>. 4.1.1 Reasoning with Certainty Factors Certainty factors were designed to be used with rule-based expert systems.

Reference-contexts: Utility of the methods for decision making. The meaning of probability values is familiar and widely used for decision making. It is possible to add a decision node to a Bayesian network that explicitly represents the probability values that are required for particular decisions <ref> (Charniak 1991) </ref>. 5. Scaleup considerations for large systems. Exact updating of the probabilities in a Bayesian network is an NP-complete problem (Cooper 1990). Fortunately, several accurate and efficient approximation methods for belief updating have been developed (Charniak 1991). <p> Bayesian network that explicitly represents the probability values that are required for particular decisions <ref> (Charniak 1991) </ref>. 5.

Fortunately, several accurate and efficient approximation methods for belief updating have been developed (Charniak 1991).

Reference-contexts: In particular, there is no convenient method for weighting different pieces of evidence. 3. Theoretical basis for the representation and reasoning methods. Fuzzy logic has been widely criticized for the lack of a theoretical foundation for its reasoning methods <ref> (Elkan 1994) </ref>. The wide variety of inference procedures, combining rules, and defuzzification techniques that have been developed is often used as an illustration of the variety of ad hoc methods that must be adopted in order to make fuzzy logic work in different situations.

Reference-contexts: base. 4.1.2 Representing Waste Characterization Uncertainty with Certainty Factors Although the original formulation of certainty factors derives the certainty associated with a piece of evidence from a measure of belief (MB) and a measure of disbelief (MD), most systems that support reasoning with certainty factors do not use these measures <ref> (Giarrantano and Riley 1994) </ref>. Instead, a single number, the certainty factor, is used directly. All types of uncertainty associated with evidence are represented with a certainty factor. For the waste characterization problem, two different methods have been used to represent imprecise concepts using certainty factors.

Reference-contexts: If we have defined a domain with a set of random variables -X 1 , ..., X n -, then a Bayesian network is a representation of the joint probability distribution over those variables <ref> (Heckerman and Wellman 1995) </ref>. The Bayesian network consists of a set of local conditional probability distributions along with a set of conditional independence assertions that enable us to compute the joint probability distribution from the local distributions. <p> An arc drawn from one node to another generally indicates that the value of the source node has a direct effect on the value of the target node. This method of constructing Bayesian networks almost always results in a network with accurate conditional independence assertions <ref> (Heckerman and Wellman 1995) </ref>. 4.3.2 Representing Waste Characterization Uncertainty with Bayesian Networks Imprecise concepts in the waste characterization domain were represented using Bayesian networks in the same way they were for certainty factors.

Reference-contexts: Our goal is to build an expert system that can integrate data from multiple sources to confirm or refute the characterization of the waste material and to quantify the confidence in that characterization. Many different methods for representing uncertainty/vagueness in expert systems have been developed <ref> (see Kanal and Lemmer 1986 for an overview) </ref>, but the four general methods are widely accepted and used are MYCIN-style certainty factors, Dempster-Shafer theory, Bayesian networks, and fuzzy logic (Henkin and Harrison 1988; Stefik 1995). All of these methods involve a quantitative representation of uncertainty.

Reference-contexts: to represent uncertainty in expert systems because these networks provide a computationally feasible mechanism for representing and reasoning with a complete probabilistic model of a domain. 4.3.1 Reasoning with Bayesian Networks Bayesian networks are based on the subjective Bayesian view of probability rather than on the objective or frequentist view <ref> (Pearl 1988) </ref>. In the objective view, probabilities represent the likelihood of an event based on the observed frequency of occurrence of an event over many experiments. In the subjective view, probabilities represent an expression of a persons belief that a particular event will occur in a single experiment.

Reference-contexts: A Bayesian network (or belief network) is a directed acyclic graph used to represent dependencies among random variables and to give a concise specification of the joint distribution function <ref> (Russell and Norvig 1995) </ref>. Each node in the network represents a random variable, i.e., a set of mutually exclusive and collective exhaustive states. The directed links between nodes represent a direct influence of the value of one random variable on the value of another. <p> Note that the categories must be mutually exclusive and exhaustive. Detection limitations of sensors are easily represented in Bayesian networks using probabilities. The noisy-OR relationship <ref> (Russell and Norvig 1995) </ref> can be used to represent the influence of several factors on the accuracy of a sensor reading.

Reference-contexts: Classification, which is a traditional task for knowledge-based systems, may be defined as identifying classes of data as solutions to a problem <ref> (Stefik 1995) </ref> . <p> The standard methods for combining CFs did not appear to work very well and required development of a custom rule of combination. 3. Theoretical basis for the representation and reasoning methods. The theoretical basis of certainty factors is the theory of confirmation <ref> (Stefik 1995) </ref>. The certainty factor approach has been widely criticized for its lack of mathematical foundation. The logic of confirmation has no inherent connection with the logic of probability. <p> The success of the certainty factor approach is dependent on the appropriateness of the assumptions of locality, detachment, and modularity <ref> (Stefik 1995) </ref>. Locality means each rule is independent and can be applied no matter what other rules are present in the knowledge base. Detachment allows one to use the conclusion of a rule for further inference without regard to how that conclusion was derived. <p> There are many expert system shells that implement certainty factors. In addition, it is quite easy to add certainty factor calculations to shells like CLIPS. 4.2 Dempster-Shafer Theory The Dempster-Shafer approach (often called DS Theory) provides a method for representing and reasoning with numerical degrees of belief <ref> (Stefik 1995) </ref>. Unlike probabilistic approaches, it does not require a complete set of prior and conditional probabilities. The Dempster-Shafer approach also provides an explicit method for representing lack of knowledge (or ignorance) while other approaches provide no explicit way to distinguish lack of knowledge and conflicting knowledge. <p> As evidence accumulates, a portion of the belief becomes associated with more refined subsets of hypotheses. 4.2.1 Reasoning with DS Theory DS Theory provides a means of iteratively updating belief in hypotheses as evidence accumulates <ref> (Stefik 1995) </ref>. <p> In fact, our rules typically assign certainty to only one hypothesis and in this case, it can be shown that the rule of combination for DS Theory reduces to the rule of combination for certainty factors <ref> (Stefik 1995) </ref>. Because the other methods for representing uncertainty that we have been investigating appear to hold much more promise, we have suspended further investigation of DS Theory in this domain. <p> Theoretical basis for the representation and reasoning methods. The mathematical foundation for Bayesian networks is Bayes Rule. Proponents of Bayesian networks always cite the firm mathematical foundation of the representation as one of its strengths <ref> (Stefik 1995) </ref>. Dependencies among pieces of evidence and hypotheses are explicitly represented in the directed graph. One must provide a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive values for all random variables. <p> Fuzzy set theory, which was created for use in pattern classification and pattern matching, allows gradual or partial membership in a set or class <ref> (Stefik 1995) </ref>. Fuzzy logic, or reasoning based upon fuzzy set theory, differs from traditional Boolean logic in that a statement need not be either true or false, but may have a degree of truth. <p> Knowledge acquisition issues. In a fuzzy logic system, one must acquire membership functions rather than single numbers. Research has shown that simple functions are usually adequate representations and can be readily supplied by domain experts <ref> (Stefik 1995) </ref> Sensitivity analysis will need to be conducted to determine the effect of small changes in membership functions on decisions. 7. Ease of implementation.
