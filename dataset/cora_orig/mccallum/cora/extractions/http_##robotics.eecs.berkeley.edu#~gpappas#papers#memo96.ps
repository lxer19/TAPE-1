Title: Towards Continuous Abstractions of Dynamical and Control Systems  
Abstract: George J. Pappas and Shankar Sastry Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences University of California at Berkeley Berkeley, CA 94720 fgpappas,sastryg@eecs.berkeley.edu Technical Report UCB/ERL M96/53, University of California at Berkeley, October 1996 Abstract The analysis and design of large scale systems is usually an extremely complex process. In order to reduce the complexity of the analysis, simplified models, called abstractions, which capture the system behavior of interest are obtained and analyzed. If the abstraction of system can be shown to satisfy certain properties of interest then so does the original complex plant. This can result in significant complexity reduction in the analysis of complex systems.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Large scale systems such as intelligent highway systems <ref> [1] </ref> and air traffic control systems [2] result in systems of very high complexity. The analysis process for complex systems consists of proving that the designed system meets certain specifications. However, the analysis may be formidable due to the complexity and magnitude of the system.

Reference-contexts: For example, verification algorithms of hybrid systems <ref> [3, 4] </ref>, which contain both discrete event dynamics at higher levels and continuous dynamics at lower levels, are based on abstracting continuous dynamics by rectangular differential inclusions [5, 6]. A similar methodology for reducing the verification complexity of discrete event systems can be found in [7].

M= ~ which sends each state p 2 M to its equivalence class [p] 2 M= ~ is called the identification map and is the map which sends each state to its abstracted state. In general, we have the following definition.

Reference-contexts: The tangent space can be thought of as a special case of a more general mathematical object called a fiber bundle. Loosely speaking, a fiber bundle can be thought of as gluing sets at each point of the manifold in a smooth way. Definition 3 (Fiber Bundles <ref> [11] </ref>) A fiber bundle is a five-tuple (B; M; ; U; fO i g i2I ) where B, M , U are smooth manifolds called the total space, the base space and the standard fiber respectively.
