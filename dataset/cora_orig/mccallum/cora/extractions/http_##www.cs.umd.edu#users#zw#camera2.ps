Abstract: Guarantees of services in a networked environment are provided by the proper allocation and scheduling of network and system resources. A lot of research in packet scheduling, QoS routing, traffic multiplexing, etc. has been aimed at providing deterministic or statistical service guarantees, while utilizing resources efficiently. In this paper, we propose a resource reservation scheme for a class of multimedia presentations. We characterize this class of multimedia presentations as synchronized distributed multimedia sessions, which we believe are important components of many multimedia applications. In addition to multimedia presentations, the reservation scheme applies to applications with synchronized resource requirements. Based on resource inquiry and interval analysis, the scheme is also able to find feasible resource allocation schedules for resource reservation requests. Built upon a layer of resource abstraction, the scheme suits well with today's heterogeneous network environment.

Reference-contexts: Despite existing reservation protocols' ability to support single stream transport and playback, they fail to address the problem in the presence of multiple multimedia streams. In many multimedia presentations and documents, multimedia objects are not isolated; instead, they are related with each other both temporally and spatially <ref> [8, 9, 1] </ref>. The MHEG standard under development by ISO's Multimedia Hypermedia Expert Group also defines a correlation structure among multimedia objects [10]. Due to the temporal structure among multimedia objects, resource requirement varies at different stages during the lifetime of a presentation. <p> There are a number of visual models to describe temporal relations among multimedia objects, such as Petri-Net <ref> [1, 9] </ref> and time-line [9, 10]. Figure 1 shows an example of a petri-net representation. The temporal relationship is defined based on the synchronization points. We use the explicit temporal intervals in our definition of SDMS, to be independent of the representation model.

Both reservation protocols have similar mechanisms: Resources are reserved hop-by-hop on the path between two communicating entities, sender and receiver. In STII, sender issues a reservation request, specifying the traffic parameters called flow-spec and the associated QoS parameters.
