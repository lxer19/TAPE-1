Title: Data Level Comparison of Wind Tunnel and Computational Fluid Dynamics Data  
Author: Qin Shen, Alex Pang Sam Uselton 
Affiliation: Computer Science Department, UCSC  MRJ Technology Solutions  
Abstract: This paper describes the architecture of a data level comparative visualization system and experiences using it to study computational fluid dynamics data and experimental wind tunnel data. We illustrate how the system can be used to compare data sets from different sources, data sets with different resolutions and data sets computed using different mathematical models of fluid flow. Suggested improvements to the system based on users' feedback are also discussed.

Reference-contexts: Currently, the derived fields are selected from a menu of pre-programmed functions. As part of our planned enhancements, users can interactively enter their functions similar to the calculator module of FAST <ref> [1] </ref>. These functions may be used to generate new derived fields as well as obtain metrics from the derived fields. 2.3 Implementation The major task necessary for the comparison framework above is support for point location.

Reference-contexts: This is one of the main tasks that the Field Encapsulation Library (FEL) <ref> [2] </ref> supports, providing a uniform interface to a wide variety of grid types. This capability makes it a natural choice for building this tool.

Reference-contexts: Three of these are from CFD simulations while the fourth is from measurements taken during a wind tunnel experiment. More detailed information about these data sets are available from <ref> [3] </ref>. These data sets are briefly described below: 1. Experimental. 6,699 grid points (dimension: 11 x 21 x 29). A seven-hole pressure probe was used to measure the velocity and pressure. 2. Computational. 1.5 million grid points (dimension: 115 x 157 x 83) using the Baldwin-Barth (BB) turbulence model. 3.

Reference-contexts: Feature comparisons are usually limited to higher dimensional analogs of image level comparisons, such as side-by-side (e.g. ribbon comparison [7]) or overlays (e.g. vortex core comparison <ref> [4] </ref>). More recently, feature level comparisons of streamlines are carried out with glyphs and animation [6]. Feature comparisons at a higher semantic level, incorporating application specific knowledge, are of great interest to users.

Reference-contexts: The main drawback of this approach is that comparison systems become less general and more application specific; the choice of operators and met rics must be made in the context of the application. For example, in certain situations such as when comparing direct volume rendering algorithms <ref> [5] </ref>, a reference model may be necessary. Data level comparison does not preclude the use of images when images are the raw data e.g. pressure sensitive paint images [8] and images of oil streaks [7]. Feature level comparison techniques are those that compare extracted features.
