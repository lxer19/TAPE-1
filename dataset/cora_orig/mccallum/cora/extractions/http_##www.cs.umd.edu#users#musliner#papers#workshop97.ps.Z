Reference-contexts: In doing this we have been driven by consideration of the scenario outlined by Gat in his paper "News From the Trenches: An Overview of Unmanned Spacecraft for AI" <ref> (Gat 1996) </ref>. In this paper, Gat presented a planning scenario from the Cassini mission that he argued no current AI planning system could tackle. The problem concerns the Saturn orbital insertion of the Cassini spacecraft.

Reference-contexts: A deliberative component of the architecture reasons about control actions, sensing actions, exogenous events and timing in order to achieve real-time behavior. After reviewing the key features of CIRCA, we discuss a new planning technique, Dynamic Abstraction Planning <ref> (Goldman et al. 1997) </ref>, that provides us with more efficient planning. We review the planning model that allows us to generate reactive controllers that provably meet real-time execution constraints. Finally, we discuss some ongoing extensions to the model. <p> The planning process is summarized in Figure 4. Dynamic Abstraction Planning The original CIRCA planner used a forward planning algorithm similar to that of Kabanza et al. (1997). This led to an explosion in the state space of the planner. In recent work <ref> (Goldman et al. 1997) </ref>, we have addressed this state-space explosion using a new planning technique that we call Dynamic Abstraction Planning (DAP).

Reference-contexts: This termination condition allows this algorithm to complete even in plans (graphs) with cy cles: once the computed L min along any path drops to (or below) 0, we're done. Related Work Kabanza et al. <ref> (Kabanza, Barbeau, & St-Denis 1997) </ref> have developed a planning method for reactive agents that is similar to the original CIRCA. Their architecture differs in emphasis, however. The NFAs it constructs are "clocked:" they make transitions at times that are the least common denominator of all possible transitions. <p> First, CIRCA considers exogenous processes only as threats, rather than as opportunities. CIRCA's planner only chooses either to preempt exogenous processes or allow them to happen. Accordingly, the current CIRCA 2 With the exception of Blythe's (1996) and Ka-banza's <ref> (Kabanza, Barbeau, & St-Denis 1997) </ref> world model provides only lower bounds on the delay of temporal transitions.

Reference-contexts: Comparison to Other Abstraction Techniques Many classical planning systems have used abstraction methods to increase the efficiency of searching for plans (see <ref> (Kambhampati 1994) </ref> for a brief survey). However, these abstractions are typically used only as guides in searching for a plan; the system may not know that its goals will actually be achieved by an abstract plan, and it will not be able to execute the abstracted operators directly.

Reference-contexts: Their method is similar to the DAP approach in that it involves aggregating states, but there are some differences. First, their method is not dynamic: aggregation is performed using a predefined set of "relevant" propositions, which is determined using Knoblock's approach <ref> (Knoblock 1994) </ref>. Second, their method is uniform: the same propositions are relevant everywhere. The underlying model is also significantly different from CIRCA's: it does not model exogenous events or the timing required for real-time guarantees. In previous work, Godefroid and Kabanza (1991) developed an abstraction technique based on partial orders.

Reference-contexts: CIRCA's planning system builds reaction plans based on a world model and a set of formally-defined safety conditions that must be satisfied by feasible plans <ref> (Musliner, Durfee, & Shin 1995) </ref>. To describe a domain to CIRCA, the user inputs a set of transition descriptions that implicitly define the set of reachable states. For example, Figure 2 illustrates several transitions used in the Puma domain. <p> The assignment of actions determine the topology of the NFA (and so the set of reachable states): preemption of temporal transitions removes edges and assignment of actions adds them. System safety is guaranteed by planning action transitions that preempt all transitions to failure, making the failure state unreachable <ref> (Musliner, Durfee, & Shin 1995) </ref>. It is this ability to build plans that guarantee the correctness and timeliness of safety-preserving reactions that makes CIRCA suited to mission-critical applications in hard real-time domains. The NFA is then translated into a memoryless controller for downloading to the RTS. <p> A plan in which all the node state sets have exactly one element corresponds to the original CIRCA planner <ref> (Musliner, Dur-fee, & Shin 1995) </ref>. A well-formed plan is one in which an arc is present for every possibly-enabled nonvolitional transition between nodes which is not preempted, and each node has outgoing arcs for at most one action (non-deterministic actions may require more than one arc). Preemption is defined below.
