Abstract: Bundy, Silver and Plummer [1] provide an analysis of the Focussing algorithm and the Classification algorithm in the case where the description space consists of a set of relation trees. This paper discusses an extension to their analysis in which the description space is construed as a geometric space. Under this construal the behaviour of both the Focussing algorithm and the Classification algorithm is analysed in terms of the construction of hypercuboids. This analysis leads to a number of observations: (i) that a distinction can be made between a strong and a weak version of the disjunctive-concept problem; (ii) that certain solutions to the disjunctive-concept problem can be shown to exploit what are, in effect, distance functions over the description space and (iii), that the Classification algorithm is only capable of learning a subset of the possible disjunctive concepts in any given domain.

Reference-contexts: In an alternative interpretation <ref> [2] </ref> the description space is a geometric space and execution of the algorithm involves the shrinking of an outer hypercuboid (which defines the most general form of the concept being learned) and the expansion of an inner hypercuboid (which defines the most specific form of the concept being learned). <p> This technique (called Shell Creation [1]) involves the construction of what are, in effect, multiple sets of markers (i.e. rule-shells). Under the hypercuboid-oriented interpretation this technique corresponds to the construction of sets of inner and outer hyper 5 cuboids <ref> [2] </ref>. Note that, in the case where multiple inner and outer hypercuboids have been constructed, the presentation of a new instance does not have deterministic consequences. If the new instance is a positive instance, then an inner hypercuboid may have to be expanded to enclose it. <p> This process terminates when every set of instances contains either uniformly positive or uniformly negative instances. The structure of attribute choices forms a decision tree (i.e. disjunctive rule) for the concept underlying the instances. In the hypercuboid-oriented interpretation of this algorithm <ref> [2] </ref>, the description space is a geometric space consisting of K dimensions each of which ranges over the possible values of a single attribute. Instances correspond to points in the normal way.
