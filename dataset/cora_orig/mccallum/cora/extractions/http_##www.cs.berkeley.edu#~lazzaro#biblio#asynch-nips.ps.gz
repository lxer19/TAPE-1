Abstract: Several research groups are implementing analog integrated circuit models of biological auditory processing. The outputs of these circuit models have taken several forms, including video format for monitor display, simple scanned output for oscilloscope display and parallel analog outputs suitable for data-acquisition systems. In this paper, we describe an alternative output method for silicon auditory models, suitable for direct interface to digital computers.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Several researchers have implemented computational models of biological auditory processing, with the goal of incorporating these models into a speech recognition system (for a recent review, see <ref> (Jankowski, 1992) </ref>). These projects have shown the promise of the biological approach, sometimes showing clear performance advantages over traditional methods. The application of these computational models is limited by their large computation and communication requirements.

Reference-contexts: Analog VLSI implementations of these neural models may relieve this computational burden; several VLSI research groups have efforts in this area, and working integrated circuit models of many popular representations presently exist. A review of these models is presented in <ref> (Lazzaro, 1991) </ref>. In this paper, we present an interface method (Mahowald, 1992; Sivilotti, 1991) that addresses the communications issues between analog VLSI auditory implementations and digital processors. 2. COMMUNICATIONS IN NEURAL SYSTEMS Biological neurons communicate long distances using a pulse representation.

Reference-contexts: An event-list message includes the identification of the output unit, and the time of firing. A performance analysis of this protocol can be found in <ref> (Lazzaro et al., 1992) </ref>. Note that an explicit timestamp for each entry in the event list is not necessary, if communication latency between the sending chip and the receiver is a constant. <p> When A c is released, the system is ready to communicate a new event. implementation, each output unit is a two-stage low-power axon circuit <ref> (Lazzaro, 1992) </ref>. The first axonal stage receives the cochlear input; this axon stage is not shown in Figure 3 (c). The first stage couples into the second stage, shown in Figure 3 (c), via the S and F wires.

Reference-contexts: Our display software produces a real-time graphical display of the auditory model response, using the X window system. 5. VLSI CIRCUIT DETAILS to circuits that perform analog processing, that are fully described and referenced in <ref> (Lazzaro et al., 1993) </ref>. The output of this analog processing is represented by 150 spiking neurons, arranged in a 30 by 5 array. These are the output units of the chip; the event-address protocol communicates the activity of these units off chip.
