Abstract: Audio and video information is sent over the Internet in a digital fashion in small blocks known as packets. These packets can be delayed or lost because of congestion on the MBone. Congestion occurs at the network routers through which the information must be passed in order to be sent to the correct destination. If information is held up for too long at the routers, the packets may arrive too late to be played out at the receiving end. Alternatively, if congestion at the router is very great, some packets may get dropped at that point. The end result of these two occurrences is the same: packet loss. Packet Loss Packet loss is the single-most disruptive factor in multimedia conferencing over the Internet. This is especially true with respect to the perception of speech. Video quality is also impaired by packet loss, but its effects are less harmful to the communicative process, since it is audio that is widely considered to be the most critical component [1]. When packets of speech information are lost, the effect on listener perception is dependent on the size of the packet and the loss rate [2]. Audio packets sizes are of 20 ms, 40 ms, or 80 ms duration. The smallest meaningful element of speech, the phoneme, has an average size of 80-100 ms [3], and so losses of this size can interfere with the intelligibility of the perceived speech. There are different methods of compensating for this packet loss, and an experiment was designed and carried out to compare the results of these schemes [2]. This study raised a number of interesting issues regarding the assessment of both audio and video quality over the Internet. The types of degradation that these media are subject to is novel and unique, and therefore existing methods for the assessment of speech and image quality and intelligibility are not always applicable in this area. This PhD seeks to identify which tests are suitable and which are not. ABSTRACT The aim of this research is to assess and establish quality thresholds for real-time Internet audio and video. Real-time multimedia conferencing over the Internet has huge potential, but there are limitations to the quality of audio and video that can be achieved, due to bandwidth limitations and the processing power of individual workstations. Assessing the effects of these limitations on the conference participant is not straightforward. The novel types of degradation found over the Internet means that existing speech and video quality assessment methods may not be applicable to multimedia conferencing experiences. This PhD will assess existing tests for measuring perceived quality from the psychology and telecommunications literature with respect to multimedia conferencing. The long term aim is to produce guidelines as to required bandwidth and quality for different multimedia conferencing tasks and applications. BACKGROUND TO THE RESEARCH AREA Multimedia conferencing involves three streams of real-time information available through an individuals workstation: audio, video and shared electronic workspace. Multimedia conferences are run over the multicast backbone of the Internet, known as the MBone, which makes multiway communication between large numbers of participants possible. In order for multimedia conferencing over the Internet to be used to its full potential, it is necessary to gain a complete understanding of the factors that affect the perceived quality of the component media, especially audio and video, so that recommendations can be made as to what bandwidth is necessary for the goal of a certain application to be achieved. Quality over packet networks such as the Internet is a function of bandwidth: as a general rule, the more bandwidth that is available, the better the quality will be. However, the major attraction of the Internet, that it is cheap and available to all, means that bandwidth is not, as yet, allocated to certain applications. It is therefore important to
