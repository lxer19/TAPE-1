Abstract: The huge information resources on the Internet have brought about many popular Internet knowledge discovery tools. A high level information gathering tool is necessary to cope with the diversity of information systems. Such a tool can release users from selecting the most appropriate tools among the various services. Also, since the database underlying any of the existing Internet services is only an incomplete snapshot of the whole Internet resources, the federation of several low level services can make maximum use of the resources. We present a system, ECHO, that gathers information from a particular kind of Internet knowledge discovery tools web search engines. It utilizes the unguided machine learning technique, data clustering, to classify the search results into semantic groups. Each of these cluster is a set of search results which are semantically related to each other. This technique is extremely effective when (1) user's query is not specific or vague. (2) the number of search results is too large to sift through. However, the benefits gained from this kind of organization go beyond this effectiveness. As data clustering often leads to discovery, the system provides a consistent, integrated view of the gathered information. It can help users focus on the group of results of interest and find their real interests.

Reference-contexts: Term normalization involves two steps: one is to delete the words in the stop list from the document representation. The other is to conflate all variants of a word into the stem form. Stop list and stemming are important to improve precision of a document representation. The SMART <ref> [2] </ref> system provides a list of standard stop words, which is widely adopted by the information retrieval systems. ECHO adopts this list of stop words, and expands the list with more words in the web documents. <p> Select initial centroids for the M clusters 2. For i := 1 to N do calculate the similarity S of D i with each centroid 3. Assign D i to closet cluster, update the corresponding centroid. 4. Go to <ref> [2] </ref>, until all the documents are clustered. 5 w The central problem is to select the initial clusters and cluster centroids. The selection has great effect on the quality of clustering. The updating of the cluster centroid has also great effect on the quality of clustering. <p> The cluster structure is often displayed as dendrogram as figure 5.3: All the methods can be described by the following general algorithm: 1. Look at each document as a cluster of single element 2. Identify the two closest points and combine them in a cluster 3. repeat <ref> [2] </ref>, until one cluster remains The hierarchical methods differ in the strategies to select two most similar clusters and in the means used to represent a cluster. A set of algorithms have been suggested: single link, complete link, group average similarity, ward's method. <p> Set all the vertex as unmarked. 2. Select one of the unmarked vertex v , Recursively find all the vertex that connect with v, set those vertex as marked, these vertices are used to form a subgraph 3. Produce a cluster from the subgraph of <ref> [2] </ref> 4. Repeat [2], until all the vertices are marked. The connected subgraph algorithm produces an initial set of clusters. The time complexity is O (n 2 ). The semantic connection is depending on the value . The bigger is, the stronger the connection is. <p> Set all the vertex as unmarked. 2. Select one of the unmarked vertex v , Recursively find all the vertex that connect with v, set those vertex as marked, these vertices are used to form a subgraph 3.

The time complexity is O (n 2 ). The semantic connection is depending on the value . The bigger is, the stronger the connection is. <p> Let fi be the predefined threshold value, we define the similarity between two clusters as the maximum similarity between two individuals, with each from two clusters. The algorithm goes through following phases: 1. For i := 1 to n, do <ref> [2] </ref> 2. Find the cluster fi j that has largest similarity with fi i , stored the similarity into an array. 3. Merge fi i with fi j if their similarity is greater or equal to fi, repeat this step until all the such pairs are merged.

Reference-contexts: We want to continue the work in the following direction: * The possibility of a better document representation. The word association measurement is a promising way to improve the precision of measurement of document similarity. Our previous on FAQfinder <ref> [7] </ref> has exploited the possible use of WordNet in query expansion which proved to be a good direction. * The possibility of application of guided machine learning techniques. Data clustering is an unguided machine learning technique, we will exploit the possible application of other methods.

Reference-contexts: The controlled vocabularies is useful in document indexing, although it's expensive or not necessarily effective. The method of construction of a thesaurus, however, is a good solution to this problem, as suggested in <ref> [10, 12] </ref>. As an information gathering tool, ECHO did not attempt to solve this fundamental problem. To do so, it calls for the cooperation of the primitive searching services. However, it is a very interesting problem for further research. <p> To do so, it calls for the cooperation of the primitive searching services. However, it is a very interesting problem for further research. We believe even a little understanding of word association can greatly help the classification of document. The pure statistical method, latent semantic indexing <ref> [10] </ref>, tries to overcome the deficiencies of term-matching by treating the unreliability of observed term-document association data as statistical problem. It assumed there is some underlying latent semantic structure in the data that is partially obscured by the randomness of word choice.

Reference-contexts: Assuming we need 50 search results from such a engine, if we just sequentially access it, the delay will be unacceptable. So, we adopt the multi-thread facility. from the WWW consortium's WWW reference library <ref> [15] </ref>. While the agent is parsing the returned result, it can issue a next nonblocking request. ECHO server The kernel part of ECHO is the ECHO server. Figure 4.2 outlines the working procedure of ECHO server. ECHO server must achieve trade-off between response time and system performance.

Reference-contexts: We can apply this method to our future work. It will be useful to get rid of the "noise" in the returned abstract of each search result. Although our preliminary experiments does not work well 7 , it is still worth continuing the experiments. Some of the related work <ref> [25] </ref> mention that adding a sophisticated query language can be a benefit of a meta search engine. Echo does not provide such a language.
