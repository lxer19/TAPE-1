Abstract: Another application of the freeze quantifier that comes to mind, concerns half-order logics of knowledge. Suppose that the set of values is a domain of agents, and that we have two modal operators, K for knowledge and 2 to change the agent that is reasoning. Then "x: " denotes the personal pronoun "I ," which cannot be modeled adequately in propositional epistemic logics. For instance, we can express properties such as "I know that everyone who I know knows that I am smarter than (s)he is": [MP89] Z. Manna, A.
