Reference-contexts: This results in a very large amount of data. In a recent space shuttle mission, using the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) instrument to study the Earth's surface, the data generated was approximately 32 terabits <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. Processing of the captured data is done in three stages: preprocessing, correlation, and postprocessing, with the correlation phase being the most compute-intensive. Parallelism is achieved both through data distribution for processing a given channel by multiple processors and by processing up to eight channels simultaneously.
