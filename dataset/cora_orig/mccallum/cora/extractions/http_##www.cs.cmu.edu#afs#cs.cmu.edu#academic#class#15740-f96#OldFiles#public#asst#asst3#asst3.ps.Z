Abstract: The first set of tasks involves implementing a procedure that optimizes the use of the processor cache(s). You may use any machine for your experiments, as long as it has a cache. You will want to find a lightly loaded machine, since any context switching can affect cache performance. Be sure to document what kind of machine you use, and whatever you can determine about its cache (capacity, associativity, line size, write policy), either through technical documentation or your own experiments. Note: We are more interested in caches for this assignment than in the particular application. Your writeup should focus on how cache behavior affects performance. You should give qualitative explanations for the performance variations you observe. Note also that good experimental method is essential to obtaining reliable measurements. You should design your experiments carefully and document your method fully.
