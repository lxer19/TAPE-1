Abstract: In this report, we investigate the relationship between the semantic and syntactic properties of verbs. Our work is based on the English Verb Classes and Alternations of (Levin, 1993). We explore how these classes are manifested in other languages, in particular, in Bangla, German, and Korean. Our report includes a survey and classification of several hundred verbs from these languages into the cross-linguistic equivalents of Levin's classes. We also explore ways in which our findings may be used to enhance WordNet in two ways: making the English syntactic information of WordNet more fine-grained, and making WordNet multilingual. This report describes research done at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This research is supported by NSF grant 9217041-ASC and ARPA under the HPCC program, as well as by a generous grant from the NEC Corporation.
