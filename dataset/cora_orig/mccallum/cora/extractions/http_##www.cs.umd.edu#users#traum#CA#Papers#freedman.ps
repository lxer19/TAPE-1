Abstract: We are currently implementing C IRCSIM -Tutor v. 3, a natural-language based intelligent tutoring system (ITS) which tutors medical students on a topic in cardiovascular physiology (the baroreceptor reflex). We outline the text generation process in C IRCSIM -Tutor and illustrate a number of issues we have faced with respect to the representation of communicative action. Version 3 of C IRCSIM -Tutor, which we are in the process of implementing, differs from many other ITSs in that its underlying architecture uses a text generation paradigm. In other words, the planners fundamental goal is generate a conversation resulting in the student knowing &lt;concepts&gt; rather than teach &lt;concepts&gt;. Thus the logical forms used for representing both input and output and many of the intermediate forms used by the planner, are representations of communicative action. (The planner is described further in Freedman 1996). Our basic knowledge representation for instructional planning is a sophisticated form of schema which allows static and dynamic preconditions, recursion and full unification. We have used schemata for this application because we need some control over the way concepts are taught, including decomposition and sequencing. The schemata were abstracted from transcripts of human tutors with students. The transcripts show the hierarchical structure of instructional planning. Although our formalism in no way requires it, it is interesting to note that regardless of the topic, all of our tree structures contain the same category of information at a given level of the tree. In this respect our analysis shows similar results to that of Kerpedjiev et al. (1997) for a multimedia generation system. The following subtree is typical:
