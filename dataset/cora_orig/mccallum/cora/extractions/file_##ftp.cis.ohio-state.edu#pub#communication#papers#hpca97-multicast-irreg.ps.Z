Abstract: This paper presents efficient multicasting with reduced contention on irregular networks with switch-based wormhole interconnection and unicast message passing. First, it is proved that for an arbitrary irregular network with a typical deadlock-free, adaptive routing, it may not be possible to create an ordered list of nodes to implement an arbitrary multicast in a contention-free manner with minimal number of communication steps. Next, three different multicast algorithms are proposed with their respective node orderings to reduce contention: switch-based ordering (SO), switch-based hierarchical ordering (SHO), and chain concatenation ordering (CCO). A variation of a binomial tree-based communication pattern with unicast message passing is used on the above ordered lists to implement multicast. The proposed multicast algorithms are compared with each other as well as with the naive random ordering (RO) algorithm for a range of system sizes, switch sizes, message lengths, degrees of connectivity, destination set sizes, and communication start-up times. The CCO algorithm is shown to be the best to implement mul-ticast with reduced contention and minimum latency. Such results related to multicast on irregular networks are the first of their kind in the wormhole literature. Thus, these results demonstrate significant potential to be applied to current and future generation NOW systems with irregular interconnection.

Reference-contexts: Switch-based networks are typically built for supporting irregular topology. Such irregularity provides flexibility to design scalable systems with incremental expansion capability. The irregularity also makes the routing on such systems quite complicated. Typically deadlock-free adaptive routing schemes <ref> [3, 14] </ref> are supported on such systems to achieve low-latency and high-bandwidth communication. Such routing flexibility also leads to difficulty in implementing a multicast/broadcast operation in a contention-free manner. Typically, tree-structured algorithms are used to minimize the number of communication start-ups (steps) required for multicast [8]. <p> In this paper we take on such a challenge and develop efficient multicast algorithms for irregular wormhole networks. Without loss of generality, we consider a deadlock-free routing scheme similar to that used in DEC AN1 networks <ref> [3] </ref>. In addition to providing deadlock-freedom, this routing provides adaptive communication between nodes in an irregular network. With respect to such routing, we first prove that no ordered chain, similar to that proposed in [8], exists to implement contention-free multicast in dlog 2 (d + 1)e steps for d destinations. <p> Thus, the interconnection topology of the network can be denoted by a graph G = (V,E) where V is the set of switches, and E is the set of bidirectional links between the switches <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. Figure 1 (b) shows the interconnection graph for the irregular network in Fig. 1 (a).

Such routing allows adaptivity, and is deadlock-free. In this routing scheme, a breadth-first spanning tree (BFS) on the graph G is first computed using a distributed algorithm. <p> Putting it in the negative, a packet may never traverse a link along the up direction after having traversed one in the down direction. Details of this routing scheme can be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. In order to implement the above routing, each switch has an indexed forwarding table. When a worm reaches a switch, the destination address is captured from the header flit of the incoming worm. <p> The routing is based on Eulerian trails. In this paper, we have considered deadlock-free, adaptive routing scheme proposed in <ref> [3] </ref> due to its simplicity and commer cial implementation. In the near future we will be extending our multicast schemes for the routing proposed in [14]. In [16] Bal et. al. proposed reliable multicast scheme on Myrinet using Fast Messages [11].

The efficiency of an algorithm is determined by the required number of start-ups for a multi-cast to complete and the degree of contention experienced among the messages of the multicast. For regular networks with e-cube routing, the concept of a dimension-ordered chain has been developed [8] to implement contention-free multicast with minimum latency. However, for irregular wormhole networks with adaptive routing, developing such contention-free multicast algorithms is a non-trivial task. To the best of our knowledge, no solutions exist in the literature in this direction. <p> In addition to providing deadlock-freedom, this routing provides adaptive communication between nodes in an irregular network. With respect to such routing, we first prove that no ordered chain, similar to that proposed in <ref> [8] </ref>, exists to implement contention-free multicast in dlog 2 (d + 1)e steps for d destinations. Next, we develop multicast algorithms which 1) minimize the number of communication start-ups (steps) for a given number of destinations and 2) minimize contention among the communication steps. <p> prove that there does not exist an ordered chain of nodes to implement contention free multicast with binomial tree-based message pattern on an arbitrary irregular network with the routing scheme discussed in Section 2.3. 3.1 Contention-Free Multicast with Ordered Chain Typically, binomial tree-based algorithms have been used in the literature <ref> [7, 8] </ref> to implement multicast on meshes, tori, and hypercubes with optimal number of communication start-ups (steps). Such an approach requires dlog 2 (d + 1)e communication steps for a multicast with d destinations. <p> Such an approach requires dlog 2 (d + 1)e communication steps for a multicast with d destinations. Besides the number of startups, an important factor which affects the overall multicast latency is the contention that messages undergo between different steps of the binomial tree-based algorithm. In <ref> [8] </ref> it has been shown that if an ordered chain can be generated among the nodes participating in the multicast, a contention free binomial multicast tree can be constructed. Let the symbol &lt; d denote such an ordering.

Let the symbol &lt; d denote such an ordering. Such ordered chains typically exhibit the following property: Property 1 [8] If there exist four nodes w, x, y, and z in an ordered chain such that w &lt; d x &lt; d y &lt; d z, then messages between processors w and x will not contend for any links with messages between processors y and z. 3.2 Non-existence of Ordered <p> The naive RO algorithm randomly orders the elements of D [ fn s g into a list, L 0 , and performs the Umesh algorithm <ref> [8] </ref> on it. This algorithm is very simple to implement and it takes dlog 2 (jDj+1)e communication start-ups (steps) to complete. Since the destinations and the source are ordered randomly, nothing can be said about contention among messages of the multicast. <p> This is done by doing a switch-based grouping of the processors and then randomly ordering these groups into the list L 0 . Similar to the RO algorithm, the Umesh algorithm <ref> [8] </ref> is now performed on L 0 . Figure 5 (b) shows the multicast tree generated using the SO algorithm for the sample multicast shown in Fig. 4 on an irregular network. It also details the list L 0 for the multicast. <p> The source node n s is chosen as the leader node of its subset. A list L 1 is formed by randomly ordering all the leader nodes. The multicast takes place in two stages. The first stage involves performing the Umesh algorithm <ref> [8] </ref> on the elements of the list L 1 . This stage takes dlog 2 jL 1 je start-ups to complete. It is to be noted that there is no contention freedom guaranteed during this stage.
