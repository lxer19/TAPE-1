Reference-contexts: Wavelength converters are assumed absent in this work. Previous networking studies have concentrated on the routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem to set up lightpaths while assuming an ideal physical layer <ref> [1] </ref>. It should, however, be noted that a signal degrades in quality due to physical-layer impairments as it proceeds through XCSs (picking up crosstalk) and EDFAs (picking up ASE noise). As a result, the bit-error rate (BER) at the receiving end of a lightpath may become unacceptably high.

Reference-contexts: Our work examines this problem. (Additional details of our approach, including a simulator that we have developed, can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>.) 2. On-Line BER Computation. This computation, during call admission, requires (1) the enumeration of all the events of signal, crosstalk, and ASE noise generation and (2) their subsequent losses and gains at each node along the respective lightpaths. <p> The EDFA gains, G in (k; i ) and G out (k; i ), for each node at all the wavelengths are evaluated using a simplified model <ref> [2] </ref>, similar to [4], which takes into account the major physical phenomena in EDFAs, such as multiwavelength signal propagation, and self-saturation and cross-saturation of the EDFA gains by the traffic-dependent signal channels.
