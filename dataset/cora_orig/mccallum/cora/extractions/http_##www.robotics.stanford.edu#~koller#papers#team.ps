Abstract: In a noncooperative game, a team is a set of players that have identical payoffs. We investigate zero-sum games where a team of several players plays against a single adversary. The team is not regarded as a single player because the team members might not be able to coordinate their actions. In such a game, a certain equilibrium can be selected naturally: the team-maxmin equilibrium. It assures the team players the best payoff they can hope for, given their inability to coordinate. A team-maxmin equilibrium exists, and in a generic game it is unique. Journal of Economic Literature Classification Number: C72.

Reference-contexts: It provides the appropriate equilibrium selection method for our games. The optimization problem for determining a team-maxmin strategy profile has nonlinear constraints in (4) since the expected payoff C i (x) contains products of probabilities. In particular, a team-maxmin strategy profile may involve irrational numbers <ref> (see Koller and Megiddo 1992, p. 537) </ref>. We chose the above example (1) with rationals in the team-maxmin strategy profile for simplicity of exposition.

Reference-contexts: Team-Maxmin Equilibria We consider now the general case with n team players. We assume that the game is represented in normal form, where each player has a finite set of strategies. (As usual, games in extensive form <ref> (Kuhn 1953) </ref> can be converted to the normal form.) The mixed strategy of team player k is denoted by the vector x k of probabilities, with probability x k s for his pure strategy s, that is, X x k and s 0 for any pure strategy s of any team <p> A strategy profile of the team is then a behavior strategy of the player. The player has perfect recall if each agent is informed about the previous chioces of the other team members. In that case, behavior strategies are as powerful as mixed strategies <ref> (Kuhn 1953) </ref>. 319 In general, we can always represent a team as a single player with imperfect recall. Then, a game of the type we have been considering corresponds to a two-person zero-sum game where one player (the adversary) has perfect recall and the other (the team) has imperfect recall.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we argue that the team-maxmin equilibrium is useful for extensive two-person zero-sum games where one of the players has imperfect recall. This topic has been of recent interest <ref> (Piccione and Rubinstein 1997) </ref>. In an extensive game, a player makes a decision at an information set. Often, one thinks of an agent of the player making that decision. In the agent normal form of the game, the agent for each information set is a separate player.
