Abstract: An extended abstract of this paper appears in Advances in Cryptology | CRYPTO '98 Proceed- Abstract We compare the relative strengths of popular notions of security for public key encryption schemes. We consider the goals of indistinguishability and non-malleability, each under chosen plaintext attack and two kinds of chosen ciphertext attack. For each of the resulting pairs of definitions we prove either an implication (every scheme meeting one notion must meet the other) or a separation (there is a scheme meeting one notion but not the other, assuming the first notion can be met at all). We similarly treat plaintext awareness, a notion of security in the random oracle model. An additional contribution of this paper is a new definition of non-malleability which we believe is simpler than the previous one. ings, Lecture notes in Computer Science, H.

Reference-contexts: We are realizing that one of their most important uses is as tools for designing higher level protocols. For example, encryption schemes meeting IND-CCA2 appear to be the right tools in the design of authenticated key exchange protocols in the public-key setting <ref> [1] </ref>. As another example, the designers of SET (Secure Electronic Transactions) selected an encryption scheme which achieves more than IND-CPA [26]. This was necessary, insofar as the SET protocols would be wrong if instantiated by a primitive which achieves only IND-CPA security. <p> We will need to discuss vectors of plaintexts or ciphertexts. A vector is denoted in boldface, as in x. We denote by jxj the number of components in x, and by x [i] the i-th component, so that x = (x <ref> [1] </ref>; : : : ; x [jxj]). We extend the set membership notation to vectors, writing x 2 x or x 62 x to mean, respectively, that x is in or is not in the set f x [i] : 1 i jxj g. <p> secure in the sense of NM-CCA1 but which is not secure in the sense of NM-CCA2. 3.2 Notation and preliminaries For relations R which could be of arbitrary arity we use the simplifying notation R (a; b) as a shorthand for R (a; b) when it is clear that b <ref> [1] </ref> = b and jbj = 1. We let a denote the bitwise complement (namely the string obtained by flipping each bit) of a.

Reference-contexts: Our discussion is limited to its use in asymmetric encryption. Similarly, chosen ciphertext attack applies to both the symmetric and asymmetric settings, but this work is specific to the latter. A preliminary version of this paper appeared as <ref> [2] </ref>. We include here material which was omitted from that version due to space restrictions. 2 Definitions of Security This section provides formal definitions for the six notions of security of an asymmetric (ie., public key) encryption scheme discussed in Section 1.1. Plaintext awareness will be described in Section 4.

Reference-contexts: The basic idea for proving chosen ciphertext security in the presence of some kind of proof of knowledge goes back to <ref> [17, 18, 3, 11] </ref>. Let us begin by recalling it. Assume there is 23 some adversary A = (A 1 ; A 2 ) that breaks in the IND-CCA2 sense. We construct an adversary A 0 = (A 0 2 ) that breaks in the IND-CPA sense.

Reference-contexts: Recall that in the RO model one embellishes the customary model of computation by providing all parties (good and bad alike) with a random function H from strings to strings. See <ref> [5] </ref> for a description of the random oracle model and a discussion of its use. The six notions of security we have described can be easily "lifted" to the RO model, giving six corresponding definitions. <p> Next are the schemes proven secure in a random oracle model; here we have those of <ref> [5, 6] </ref>, which meet PA and are as efficient as schemes in current standards. Then there are schemes without proofs, such as those of [10, 27]. Finally, there are schemes for non-standard models, like [17, 25].

Reference-contexts: on which to focus. (IND-CCA2 has already proven to be a better tool for protocol design.) We thus suggest that, in the future, "CCA" should be understood to mean adaptive CCA. 1.3 Plaintext Awareness Another adversarial goal we will consider is plaintext awareness (PA), first defined by Bellare and Rogaway <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> We also note that our definitional idea lifts to other settings, like defining semantic security [19] against chosen ciphertext attacks. (Semantic security seems not to have been defined against CCA.) With regard to plaintext awareness, we make a small but important refinement to the definition of <ref> [6] </ref>. The change allows us to substantiate their claim that plaintext awareness implies chosen ciphertext security and non-malleability, by giving us that PA (plus IND-CPA) implies the RO versions of IND-CCA2 and NM-CCA2. <p> Next are the schemes proven secure in a random oracle model; here we have those of <ref> [5, 6] </ref>, which meet PA and are as efficient as schemes in current standards.

(These sets might change from scheme to scheme.) Then provide an H-oracle to A 1 and A 2 , and allow that E pk and D sk may depend on H (which we write as E H sk ). 4.1 Definition Our definition of PA is from <ref> [6] </ref>, except that we make one important refinement. An adversary B for plaintext awareness is given a public key pk and access to the random oracle H.

Reference-contexts: We believe our formulation is simpler. It is defined via an experiment involving only the adversary; there is no simulator. Nonetheless, it does not lose strength: Theorem A.2 (due to <ref> [7] </ref>) says that our definition implies that of [13, 14] under any form of attack. The definitions are not known to be equivalent because the other direction is open. See Appendix A.

Reference-contexts: This viewpoint was suggested to us by Moni Naor [23]. We consider two different goals: indistinguishability of encryptions, due to Goldwasser and Micali [19], and non-malleability, due to Dolev, Dwork and Naor <ref> [12] </ref>. Indistinguishability (IND) formalizes an adversary's inability to learn any information about the plaintext x underlying a challenge ciphertext y, capturing a strong notion of privacy. <p> IND-CPA is the notion of [19]; 1 IND-CCA1 is the notion of [24]; IND-CCA2 is the notion of [25]; NM-CPA, NM-CCA1 and NM-CCA2 are from <ref> [12, 13, 14] </ref>. 1.2 Implications and Separations In this paper we work out the relations between the above six notions. <p> The original definition of non-malleability <ref> [12, 13, 14] </ref> is in terms of simulation, requiring, for every adversary, the existence of some appropriate simulator. We believe our formulation is simpler. It is defined via an experiment involving only the adversary; there is no simulator. <p> of the work of Dolev, Dwork and Naor (the manuscript [14]) has, independently of our work, considered the question of relations between notions of encryption, and contains (currently in Remark 3.6) various claims that overlap to some extent with ours. (Public versions of their work, namely the 1991 proceedings version <ref> [12] </ref> and the 1995 technical report [13], do not contain these claims.) It is not the purpose of this paper to discuss specific schemes designed for meeting any of the notions of security described in this paper. <p> Nonetheless, as a snapshot of the state of the art, we attempt to summarize what is known about meeting "beyond IND-CPA" notions of security. Schemes proven secure under standard assumptions include that of [24], which meets IND-CCA1, that of <ref> [12] </ref>, which meets IND-CCA2, and the much more efficient recent scheme of Cramer and Shoup [9], which also meets IND-CCA2. Next are the schemes proven secure in a random oracle model; here we have those of [5, 6], which meet PA and are as efficient as schemes in current standards. <p> Bleichenbacher [8] has recently shown that a popular encryption scheme, RSA PKCS #1, does not achieve IND-CCA1. We comment that non-malleability is a general notion that applies to primitives other than encryption <ref> [12] </ref>. Our discussion is limited to its use in asymmetric encryption. Similarly, chosen ciphertext attack applies to both the symmetric and asymmetric settings, but this work is specific to the latter. A preliminary version of this paper appeared as [2]. <p> Rather than writing R (x 1 ; : : : ; x t ) we write R (x; x), meaning the first argument is special and the rest are bunched into a vector x with jxj = t 1. 6 Idea. The notion of non-malleability was introduced in <ref> [12] </ref>, with refinements in [13, 14]. <p> The question is how exactly one measures the advantage of the adversary. This turns out to need care. One possible formalization is that of <ref> [12, 13, 14] </ref>, which is based on the idea of simulation; it asks that for every adversary there exists a certain type of "simulator" that does just as well as the adversary but without being given y. Here, we introduce a novel formalization which seems to us to be simpler. <p> The requirement that M is valid is important; it stems from the fact that encryption is not intended to conceal the length of the plaintext. See Section A.2 for a discussion of the somewhat different way that <ref> [12] </ref> handle some of these issues. Remark 2.3 [Histories] One might want to strengthen the notion to require that the adversary's advantage remains small even if it obtains, somehow, some a priori information about the message x. <p> As mentioned before, we summarize only the main relations (the ones that require proof); all other relations follow as corollaries. 3.1 Results The first result, that non-malleability implies indistinguishability under any type of attack, was of course established by <ref> [12] </ref> in the context of their definition of non-malleability, but since we have a new definition of non-malleability, we need to re-establish it. The (simple) proof of the following is in Section 3.3. <p> This is allowed by Definition 2.2 since the only restriction is that the vector of ciphertexts y the adversary outputs should not contain y k b. However, the definition of <ref> [12] </ref> did not allow this, and, in order to have a stronger separation result that also applies to their notion, we gave the above more involved construction. 3.6 Proof of Theorem 3.6 [NM-CPA 6) IND-CCA1] Let's first back up a bit and provide some intuition about why the theorem might be

IND-CPA is the notion of <ref> [19] </ref>; 1 IND-CCA1 is the notion of [24]; IND-CCA2 is the notion of [25]; NM-CPA, NM-CCA1 and NM-CCA2 are from [12, 13, 14]. 1.2 Implications and Separations In this paper we work out the relations between the above six notions. <p> We view the new definition as an additional, orthogonal contribution which could simplify the task of working with non-malleability. We also note that our definitional idea lifts to other settings, like defining semantic security <ref> [19] </ref> against chosen ciphertext attacks. (Semantic security seems not to have been defined against CCA.) With regard to plaintext awareness, we make a small but important refinement to the definition of [6]. <p> We define a version of this notion, indistinguishability of encryptions (IND), following <ref> [19, 22] </ref>, through a simple experiment. Algorithm A 1 is run on input the public key, pk.

Reference-contexts: This viewpoint was suggested to us by Moni Naor <ref> [23] </ref>. We consider two different goals: indistinguishability of encryptions, due to Goldwasser and Micali [19], and non-malleability, due to Dolev, Dwork and Naor [12]. Indistinguishability (IND) formalizes an adversary's inability to learn any information about the plaintext x underlying a challenge ciphertext y, capturing a strong notion of privacy. <p> Acknowledgments Following an oral presentation of an earlier version of this paper, Moni Naor suggested that we present notions of security in a manner that treats the goal and the attack model orthogonally <ref> [23] </ref>. We are indebted to him for this suggestion. We also thank Hugo Krawczyk, Moti Yung, and the (other) members of the CRYPTO '98 program committee for excellent and extensive comments.

Reference-contexts: Under CPA the adversary can obtain ciphertexts of plaintexts of her choice. In the public key setting, giving the adversary the public key suffices to capture these attacks. Under CCA1, formalized by Naor and Yung <ref> [24] </ref>, the adversary gets, in addition to the public key, access to an oracle for the decryption function. <p> One can "mix-and-match" the goals fIND; NMg and attacks fCPA; CCA1; CCA2g in any combination, giving rise to six notions of security: IND-CPA; IND-CCA1; IND-CCA2; NM-CPA; NM-CCA1; NM-CCA2 : Most are familiar (although under different names). IND-CPA is the notion of [19]; 1 IND-CCA1 is the notion of <ref> [24] </ref>; IND-CCA2 is the notion of [25]; NM-CPA, NM-CCA1 and NM-CCA2 are from [12, 13, 14]. 1.2 Implications and Separations In this paper we work out the relations between the above six notions. <p> Nonetheless, as a snapshot of the state of the art, we attempt to summarize what is known about meeting "beyond IND-CPA" notions of security. Schemes proven secure under standard assumptions include that of <ref> [24] </ref>, which meets IND-CCA1, that of [12], which meets IND-CCA2, and the much more efficient recent scheme of Cramer and Shoup [9], which also meets IND-CCA2.

Reference-contexts: Colloquially this attack has also been called a "lunchtime," "lunch-break," or "midnight" attack.) Under CCA2, due to Rackoff and Simon <ref> [25] </ref>, the adversary again gets (in addition to the public key) access to an oracle for the decryption function, but this time she may use this decryption function even on ciphertexts chosen after obtaining the challenge ciphertext y, the only restriction being that the adversary may not ask for the decryption <p> IND-CPA is the notion of [19]; 1 IND-CCA1 is the notion of [24]; IND-CCA2 is the notion of <ref> [25] </ref>; NM-CPA, NM-CCA1 and NM-CCA2 are from [12, 13, 14]. 1.2 Implications and Separations In this paper we work out the relations between the above six notions. <p> Then there are schemes without proofs, such as those of [10, 27]. Finally, there are schemes for non-standard models, like <ref> [17, 25] </ref>. It follows from our results that the above mentioned scheme of [9], shown to meet IND-CCA2, also meets NM-CCA2, and in particular is non-malleable under all three forms of attack. Bleichenbacher [8] has recently shown that a popular encryption scheme, RSA PKCS #1, does not achieve IND-CCA1.

Reference-contexts: For example, encryption schemes meeting IND-CCA2 appear to be the right tools in the design of authenticated key exchange protocols in the public-key setting [1]. As another example, the designers of SET (Secure Electronic Transactions) selected an encryption scheme which achieves more than IND-CPA <ref> [26] </ref>. This was necessary, insofar as the SET protocols would be wrong if instantiated by a primitive which achieves only IND-CPA security. Because encryption schemes which achieve more than IND-CPA make for easier-to-use (or harder-to-misuse) tools, emerging standards rightly favor them.

Reference-contexts: Next are the schemes proven secure in a random oracle model; here we have those of [5, 6], which meet PA and are as efficient as schemes in current standards. Then there are schemes without proofs, such as those of <ref> [10, 27] </ref>. Finally, there are schemes for non-standard models, like [17, 25]. It follows from our results that the above mentioned scheme of [9], shown to meet IND-CCA2, also meets NM-CCA2, and in particular is non-malleable under all three forms of attack.
