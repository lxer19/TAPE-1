Abstract: In this paper we examine exchange-of-support for a simple planar bipedal robot. We derive a set of conditions which will ensure that the robot's body does not experience an instantaneous change in velocity at exchange-of-support. These conditions specify leg lengths and velocities which the robot must achieve for impactless walking. We propose to smooth the single-support phase through the use of appropriate leg length programs and examine one such program. Finally, we describe an experimental robot we constructed to facilitate the testing of these ideas, and present brief experimental results.

Reference-contexts: Dynamic machines, in contrast, do not require a broad base of support, and do not suffer the speed restrictions of static machines. Miura and Shi-moyama <ref> [1] </ref> built the first actively balancing robot, a biped with one motor on each leg for abduction and adduction of the hip, and a third motor to separate the legs fore and aft.

Reference-contexts: The feet of the biped were like stilts, providing essentially point contacts with the ground, and the machine fell over without active control. Others have followed with many different dynamically balancing walkers, including bipeds. See, for example, Raibert <ref> [2] </ref>, and Furusho and Sano [3] for review. It is usual in the literature to divide bipedal locomotion into single-support and double-support phases [4]. We prefer, however, a division into single-support (SS) and exchange-of-support (EOS).

We prefer, however, a division into single-support (SS) and exchange-of-support (EOS). Exchange of v + trajectory and the discontinuous body velocity at exchange-of-support as a result of an impulsive collision at each footfall. support is then intuitively defined as the phase during which the legs trade roles.

Reference-contexts: Inman et al. <ref> [5] </ref> composed a model of human walking based on the compass gait (Figure 2). In the compass gait, flexions and extensions of the hips are the only motions permitted, and the pelvis follows a series of arcs whose radii is the leg length. <p> Looking again to human walking for guidance, we find that during single-support, humans employ a pelvic tilt and rotation which serve to effectively increase the stance leg length and hence flatten the arcs of the compass gait <ref> [5] </ref>.

His model, which has fixed and equal leg lengths, resembles a spoked wagon wheel with the outer rim removed.

They concluded that soft foot pads, low foot mass, and low velocity footfalls reduce the foot forces at EOS and smooth the body trajectory.

Reference-contexts: If ` o is the body height, then the leg length ` is simply ` = ` o sec : This trajectory, investigated by Kajita and Tani <ref> [8] </ref>, is interesting here because the body translates horizontally without any vertical motion. The flat trajectory would appear to be an excellent candidate for smooth walking. This may not necessarily be the case, however.
