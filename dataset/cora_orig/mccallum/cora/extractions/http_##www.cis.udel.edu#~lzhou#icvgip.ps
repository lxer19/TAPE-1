Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for recovering nonrigid motion and structure of clouds under affine constraints using time-varying cloud images obtained from meteorological satellites. This problem is challenging not only due to the correspondence problem but also due to the lack of depth cues in the 2D cloud images (scaled orthographic projection). In this paper, affine motion is chosen as a suitable model for small local cloud motion. However, the cloud motion model can also be extended and not necessarily be affine. Analysis of intensity images is first used to find the candidates of correspondence for each point. Then affine motion model is utilized to find the structure (cloud-top height), motion parameters, and point correspondences. Extensive analysis has been done on defining appropriate constraints on depth that are necessary for achieving converge. Finally, experimental results on time-varying images of hurricane Luis, captured by GOES-9 satellite in geosynchronous orbit are presented. We believe that this is the first reported work on estimating structure and motion under scaled orthographic views, when the object of interest is undergoing a nonrigid motion. Our results are very encouraging, and have many potential applications especially in earth and space sciences.

Reference-contexts: Very limited studies have been conducted to recover structure and nonrigid motion at the same time from time-varying images. Balasubramanian et al. recovered 3D structure and nonrigid motion from 2D image sequences under perspective projection <ref> [1] </ref>. In this paper, we develop novel techniques for recovering structure and nonrigid motion from a sequence of 2D cloud images which are undergoing scaled orthographic projection. The motion model used in this paper is affine but it can also be extended to quadric, fluid or other general motion models.

Reference-contexts: Also, the scaled orthographic projection in cloud images makes the structure problem more difficult. Earlier work on cloud tracking is based on 3D analysis. Authors in <ref> [15] </ref> use 3D data obtained from stereo analysis, and/or approximate 2D intensity images for depth information in order to perform cloud tracking. In this paper, however, we use 2D images to estimate not only motion but also structure. <p> Affine motion model is a gen eral non-rigid motion model and has more power in describing nonrigid motion. Also, affine motion model has been experimentally proven to be a suitable model for small local cloud motion <ref> [15] </ref>. A lot of work has been done on affine motion [10] [12] [9] [8]. However, most of the work assumed correspondence [8] or did not recover structure at the same time. <p> For numerical simplicity and ensuring convergence, two eliminations of unknowns have been done in our method. For the first cloud frame in our experiments, we have a stereo occurrence. Stereo analysis of this pair of images has been done to obtain the disparities in <ref> [15] </ref>. Then, the depth unknowns in the first frame can be eliminated by fixing them with these disparities. This is very important for our algorithm. Due to the poor constraints on depth in cloud images, much more constraints on depth are necessary. Stronger constraints will be discussed in section 4. <p> Clearly, we need some restrictions on the the range of values the depth can take. For cloud images, intensity is a good proportional guess for depth <ref> [15] </ref>. Based on this observation, we can specify a small range for the depth of each point. This range is obtained using a proportional factor between intensity and depth. <p> We have a stereo occurrence with Goes-8 images for 1621 UTC and 1634 UTC. Stereo analysis of these pairs have been done on a Maspar parallel machine, using a coarse-to-fine, hierarchical algorithm which was previously developed at NASA-Goddard <ref> [15] </ref>. As we mentioned before, we use the disparities of 1621 UTC to eliminate the depth unknowns in the first image (1621 UTC). Fig. 3 shows the intensity image of 1621 UTC.
