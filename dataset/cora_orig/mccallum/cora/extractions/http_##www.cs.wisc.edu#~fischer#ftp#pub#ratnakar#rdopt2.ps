Abstract: In this paper, the RD-OPT algorithm for optimizing Discrete Cosine Transform quantization tables [RL95] is extended to incorporate global thresholding. Performance gains are possible by zeroing off some DCT coefficients in DCT-based image compression. We describe a global thresholding scheme, in which the zeroing thresholds for coefficients can be arbitrarily different from those determined by the quantization table. Unlike local thresholding [CR95], the zeroing decisions are not made separately for each image block. This simplifies the use of thresholding, is easier to optimize and is almost as effective as local thresholding.

RD-OPT with global thresholding gives a PSNR gain of about 2dB at most bit rates. This is comparable to the results with local thresholding in <ref> [CR95] </ref>.

The lack of correlation between coefficients allows the rate to be decomposed as a sum of contributions from individual coefficients. It has been shown in <ref> [RFVK94] </ref> that the coefficient-wise average of entropies of the quantized DCT coefficients is a very good estimate of the rate resulting from two-pass Huffman coding of runlengths. This allows us to approximate R (Q; T ) as a sum of rates of individual coefficients.

Most DCT-based compression schemes use uniform scalar quantization of the coefficients, as determined by a table of quantizers. The RD-OPT algorithm <ref> [RL95] </ref> is a technique to optimize these quantization tables in an image-specific manner. RD-OPT has the advantages of being fast, and optimizing jointly over a wide range of compression rates, as compared to other DCT quantization table optimization techniques such as [WG93, MS93]. <p> This is very similar to optimizing the quantization tables alone as in <ref> [RL95] </ref>, hence only the aspects pertaining to thresholding are described. It is desirable to have low rate (high compression) and low distortion (high quality). However, varying (Q; T ) has opposite effects on distortion and rate. <p> Only integral entries are considered for threshold tables, but arbitrary precision is possible at the cost of higher complexity. Recall that RD-OPT calculates the contributions of individual coefficients to the total rate and total distortion, and then runs a Dynamic Programming algorithm to minimize two sums <ref> [RL95] </ref>. For each coefficient n and for each possible quantizer scale q, the contribution to total rate of the n th coefficient is calculated as R [n][q], and the contribution to total distortion as D [n][q]. <p> Gather DCT statistics for the image. Step 2. Use the statistics to calculate R [n][q][t] and D [n][q][t] for each possible (q; t). Step 3. Use dynamic programming to optimize R (Q; T ) against D (Q; T ). The details of these steps are exactly as in <ref> [RL95] </ref>. The only difference is the extra freedom in choosing thresholds along with quantizer scales. 3.1 Complexity Let MAXRATE be the largest value of rate (after discretization by multiplying with a large integer constant). <p> For both these images, global thresholding along with quantization table optimization results in an improvement of 1-2 dB. Note that many perceptually weighted distortion measures can be used in RD-OPT <ref> [RL95] </ref>, and this remains true for the thresholding extension. 6 Conclusion We have introduced the notion of global thresholding, which can be used to improve the performance of DCT-based image compression.
