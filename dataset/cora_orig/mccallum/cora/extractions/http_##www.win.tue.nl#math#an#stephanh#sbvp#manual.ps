Reference-contexts: x N ) 2 B 0 fi B 1 fi fi R n , which satisfy: F i (x i ) = x i+1 ; 0 i &lt; N; In general, this problem will be much better conditioned than the problem we derived with single shooting, as is shown in <ref> [1] </ref>. 2.2 Solving the resulting algebraic equation We are now left with the task of solving the equation: G (x) = 0; x 2 V; where V is some finite-dimensional inner product space with induced norm kcdotk 2 , and G : W ! V is some continuous, differentiable function defined

Reference-contexts: The behaviour of the system is described by the following equations: _x = OE (x; u; t); Here x is the internal state of the system. The problem is to determine, given the input u and the output y, the state vector x. It can be shown <ref> [2, pages 6-8] </ref> that this problem leads to a two-point boundary value problem of the following form: _x = (x; u; t) + W 1 ; @ T @ V (m (t) y): with boundary conditions: (t 0 ) = R 0 (x (t 0 ) x 0 ); This formulation
