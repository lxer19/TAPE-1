Abstract: Unlike wired links, wireless network bandwidth is highly limited and the channel usually suffers from frequent and bursty loss due to its vulnerability to various kinds of interference. At the same time, the traditional TCP with its congestion control is well known for its poor performance over wireless links. This paper proposes a new protocol that (1) replaces TCP/IP over the wireless link by a simpler protocol with smaller headers, if the link is the last hop along a data path, (2) shifts functions needed to communicate with an Internet host using TCP/IP from the mobile host to the base station, so that the distinct wireless link is hidden from the outside Internet, and (3) exploits link-layer acknowledgments and re-transmissions to quickly recover losses over the wireless link. Our simulation results show a substantial performance improvement achieved by the new protocol.

Reference-contexts: Great efforts have been made to deal with this issue in order to improve performance. 3.2 Split Connection Bakre and Badrinath <ref> [1] </ref> proposed the Indirect TCP for Mobile Hosts (I-TCP). This protocol splits a traditional TCP connection between a mobile host and a corresponding host into wired part and wireless part, with the base station at the middle point. While [1] envisioned the use of a better adapted transport-layer protocol over the <p> in order to improve performance. 3.2 Split Connection Bakre and Badrinath <ref> [1] </ref> proposed the Indirect TCP for Mobile Hosts (I-TCP). This protocol splits a traditional TCP connection between a mobile host and a corresponding host into wired part and wireless part, with the base station at the middle point. While [1] envisioned the use of a better adapted transport-layer protocol over the wireless link, Yavatkar and Bhagawat [20] carried out this idea by employing TCP selective acknowledgment options [16] With this mechanism, a receiver returns a selective ACK (SACK) when it receives an segment out of sequence to inform the sender <p> METP's coarse-grain acknowledgment policy contributes a large part of its better performance. Exploiting the link-layer recovery mechanism distinguishes METP from other split connection schemes <ref> [1, 20, 11] </ref>. The simulation results presented in the previous section support this argument. As in any effort to shift more responsibility from the mobile host to the base station, hand-off latency is always a major concern.

Reference-contexts: We also note that as the bursty loss rate grows, the advantage of split SACK over simple split connection scheme becomes larger. This shows that TCP with selective ACK is better for dealing with bulk losses, a result echoed by Yavatkar and Bha-gawat [20] and Balakrishnan et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. 4. The performance of METP is also consistent in that it has smaller confidence intervals than other split connection schemes and TCP Reno in nearly all cases. The confidence intervals of the split TCP and TCP Reno are significantly larger where the loss rate is higher. 5.

Reference-contexts: a mobile host and an Internet host is split into two parts at the supervising host, which talks to the Internet host using traditional TCP and communicates with the mobile host through a simpler protocol (M-TCP) on top of a reliable virtual circuit connection. 3.3 Lower-Layer Solution Balakrishnan et al. <ref> [3] </ref> proposed the SNOOP module between TCP and IP layers. At the base station, it monitors the packets being sent to the mobile host and the acknowledgments sent by the mobile host. Packets that have not yet been acknowledged are buffered. <p> We call this split SACK for short. 3. A TCP-aware link layer together with multicast forwarding and intelligent buffering. This is very similar to the SNOOP module with a smooth hand-off optimization proposed in <ref> [3] </ref>. We call this LL-MC (Link Layer with MultiCast) for short. For simplicity in our simulation, the mobile host invites a base station to join the multicast group that is the care-of address of the mobile host, and the base station never leaves this multicast group.

Reference-contexts: Its exponential back-off [14] and slow-start [12] policies were particularly aimed at relieving congestion. However, earlier researches showed that wired and wireless media have significantly different error characteristics. While data losses on a wired link are very rare and random in nature, errors on a wireless medium are bursty <ref> [4, 10] </ref>. This means the effective bandwidth over this link may drop down to almost 0 during a burst of errors, and then return to the full capacity. Such bandwidth drop has nothing to do with the number of packets being transmitted over the link. <p> Karn's algorithm [14] may aggravate the silence period described above by exponentially increasing the timeout in case of retransmission, when a retransmission is also lost during a bursty loss period. Such performance deteriorations have been demonstrated in earlier work <ref> [4, 6] </ref>. 2.3 Mobile Computing Environment With Infras tructure Support In order to alleviate the performance problems of the existing TCP/IP over wireless networks, we intend to take advantage of the base station support and the fact that functions of mobile devices are limited. <p> But with well-connected base stations and generally fewer connections on a mobile machine at any time, performance improvements mentioned above can still outweigh this disadvantage, as suggested in our simulation results. There have been several papers on providing reliability at the link layer. For example, Bhagwat et al. <ref> [4] </ref> deals with a base station serving multiple mobile hosts with different channel states. Such an approach can be easily incorporated into METP to further improve the performance. There are several issues that can hardly be addressed through simulations.

Reference-contexts: They use the asymmetrically based protocol design for the connection management, retransmission and timer, and flow control over the wireless link to shift much of the work from the comparatively limited and volatile mobile host to the more powerful and stable base station.

Reference-contexts: Even with general purpose machines, people are unlikely to perform complicated work that requires a lot of network connections on the fly. 3 Related Work 3.1 TCP/IP Header Compression Van Jacobson [13] proposed TCP/IP header compression for low-speed serial links, and Degermark et al. <ref> [8] </ref> provides both UDP/IP and TCP/IP header compression mechanisms over wireless networks. Their basic observation is that among a stream of consecutive packets, a large part of the header does not change very often. <p> The size of the new header would be 12 bytes for IPv4, in comparison with 28 bytes of the UDP/IP header and 40 bytes of the TCP/IP header. We propose to further reduce the METP header size by employing the idea of header compression in [13] and <ref> [8] </ref>. We add 4 bytes to the full METP header to include a connection ID, a sequence number and a few flags. <p> The ensuing METP packets of this connection contain only the added 4 bytes in the header. Since the link layer reliability mechanism mentioned above enables the sender to detect any potential loss of packets, all possible performance degradation caused by losses that <ref> [8] </ref> tries to alleviate does not exist in our case. The connection ID is assigned by the base station and is invalidated when the connection is closed.

Reference-contexts: Retransmission at the link layer. Since a wireless medium may encounter a high rate of packet losses, a need for explicit MAC layer acknowledgment for each data packet has been widely recognized within the IEEE 802.11 subcommittee. One of the recommendations <ref> [9] </ref> is to use CSMA/CA with priority ACK. In addition to CSMA/CA, which reduces the collision probability among multiple stations accessing the same medium, the proposal adds an immediate ACK to allow MAC level recovery from lost frames.
