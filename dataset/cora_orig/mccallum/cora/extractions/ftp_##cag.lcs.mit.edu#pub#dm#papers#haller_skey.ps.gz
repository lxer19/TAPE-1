Abstract: Computing systems have been under increasingly sophisticated attack over the Internet and by using dial-up access ports. One form of attack is eavesdropping on network connections to obtain login id's and passwords of legitimate users. This information is used at a later time to attack the system. We have developed a prototype software system, the S/KEY TM one-time password system, to counter this type of attack and have been using it experimentally for external access to a research computer complex at Bellcore.
