Abstract: This work demonstrates the application of the behavior-based approach to generating ethologically-inspired adaptive foraging using a division of labor into exclusive spatial territories. First, we use fixed group sizes to evaluate and compare the performance of the two types of adaptive solutions. Second, using a collection of experimental robot data, we empirically derive and demonstrate the critical mass for most effective foraging in our domain, and show the decline of performance of the space division strategy with increased group size.

Reference-contexts: The experiments were conducted with a group of four IS Robotics R2e robots programmed in the Behavior Language, based on the Subsumption Architecture <ref> (Brooks 1990a, Brooks 1986) </ref>. The robots are fully autonomous and equipped with with on-board power and processing. They consist of a differentially steerable wheeled base and a gripper for grasping and lifting objects.

Reference-contexts: We also show how the performance of the group declines when the described task division strategy is applied to an increased group size, in a fixed-size global workspace. 2 Motivation Designing and understanding group behavior are complementary and complex problems in artificial intelligence, robotics, and ethology <ref> (Brooks 1990b, Mataric 1995) </ref>. Our previous work introduced a methodology for synthesizing a basis behavior substrate for generating various behaviors commonly found in nature, including aggregation, dispersion, following, flocking, and foraging (Mataric 1995).

Reference-contexts: Evolution has produced territoriality as a stable and recurring behavioral pattern across social species. Territoriality produces a physical division of space and all associated resources such as food and shelter <ref> (Gould 1982, McFarland 1987) </ref>. In this paper, we explore the effects of territoriality on foraging, the prototypical group behavior we have been using for studying social interaction and learning (Mataric 1994b).

Reference-contexts: Mataric (1992b) describes early work on minimizing complexity in controlling a collection of robots, and Mataric (1992a) outlines the first empirical results with the basis behaviors for control. These served as the foundation for the subsequent demonstrated group behaviors, including following, aggregation, dispersion, homing, flocking, and foraging <ref> (Mataric 1994a, Mataric 1995) </ref>. The work described here used the same behavior-based methodology, constructing the individual agent controllers out of collections of distributed behavior networks. <p> and can adapt that territory dynam ically, depending on the size of the active group. 6 Sources of Interference As in any multi-agent system, the interaction of a collection of robots produces interference, resulting from a competition for shared resources in the environment, in this case physical space and pucks <ref> (Mataric 1994a) </ref>. <p> This efficiency is directly dependent on the spatial density of the agents, since the most fundamental type of resource competition the robots encounter is that for space. This is a direct result of embodiment, and the underlying cause of basic interactions and behaviors in embodied robots and animals <ref> (Mataric 1994a) </ref>. In this particular experiment, and based on the examination of the quantitative data recorded during repeated trials, we have found the sources of uncertainty, inherent to embodied agents, that demonstrate the critical mass for most effective foraging.

This paper extends our work on homogeneous agent groups executing identical control strategies over the entire environment to a somewhat more complex case of employing a spatial division of labor based on an ethologically common organizational principle of territoriality.
