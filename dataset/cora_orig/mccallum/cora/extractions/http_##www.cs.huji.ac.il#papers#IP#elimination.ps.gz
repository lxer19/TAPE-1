Title: The Study of 3D-from-2D using Elimination  
Author: Michael Werman Amnon Shashua 
Note: One of the appealing features of the elimination approach is that it is simple to apply and does not require any understanding of the underlying 3D from 2D geometry and algebra.

Abstract: This paper unifies most of the current literature on 3D geometric invariants from point correspondences across multiple 2D views by using the tool of Elimination from algebraic geometry. The technique allows one to predict results by counting parameters and reduces many complicated results obtained in the past (reconstruction from two and three views, epipolar geometry from seven points, trilinearity of three views, the use of a priori 3D information such as bilateral symmetry, shading and color constancy, and more) into a few lines of reasoning each. The tool of Grobner base computation is used in the elimination process. In the process we obtain several results on N-view geometry, and obtain a general result on invariant functions of 4 views and its corresponding quadlinear tensor: 4 views admit minimal sets of 16 invariant functions (of quadlinear forms) with 81 distinct coefficients that can be solved linearly from 6 corresponding points across 4 views. This result has non-trivial implications to the understanding of N-view geometry. We show a new result on single-view invariants based on 6 points and show that certain relationships are impossible.

Reference-contexts: But overall, the answers are fragmentary and ranging over a wide spectrum of tools and notations. For example, it is known that 5 corresponding points across two views provide a solution to the relative (calibrated) camera positions up to a 10-fold ambiguity <ref> [7] </ref>; 7 corresponding points provide a solution in a projective setting (uncalibrated cameras) up to a 3-fold ambiguity [7].

The case of 6 points has not been addressed in the past. A unique linear solution can be obtained from 8 points [15], and likewise in the projective case [6, 11, 27]. <p> The degree of the polynomial in dicates the number of solutions (or at least an up-per bound) (which we know is 3 from <ref> [7] </ref>). Furthermore, running the Grobner bases program (using Macaulay or Maple, with a sufficient amount of memory) we get a third-order polynomial in Z which is a closed-from solution to the reconstruction problem (for n = 7; N = 2). <p> Thus if one coordinate is given, we can recover the other two space coordinates. So far we have re-derived the results of <ref> [7] </ref> on reconstruction from 7 points and discussed the case of 6 points across two views. In a similar straightforward manner we can address the case of N = 3 views, as follows. <p> Note that the epipolar geometry (location of epipoles) can be computed (non-linearly) from 7 points (classic problem of Chasles <ref> [7] </ref>) up to a three-fold ambiguity, yet the bilinear invariant function of two views (the matching constraint) as a function of image pairs requires at least 8 pairs.

Reference-contexts: Results in the case of N (N &gt; 2) views are sporadic. For N = 3, 6 corresponding points are sufficient for a projective reconstruction of camera position, up to a 3-fold ambiguity [25]; 7 points provide a unique linear solution <ref> [8, 30] </ref>. Invariant trilinear functions of 3 views come in linearly independent sets of 4 functions, have 27 distinct coefficients, and can be recovered linearly from 7 points [28]. The minimal number of algebraically independent functions of 3 views is 3 [37]. <p> The 27 coefficients sit in a tensor whose relation to 3D invariants, epipolar geometry and intrinsic structures of 3 views has been recently derived in <ref> [30, 8] </ref>. We see that a linear solution requires an extra point, but also an extra equation. In other words, the four trilinear equations are not algebraically independent but they are linearly independent.

Therefore, in practice a reduced set of parameters is typically used for an approximate model.

It has been argued that 3 basis functions can approximate well the color of natural objects and light sources.

Reference-contexts: There are still invariants over camera parameters that are not invariant to the 3D structure of the object. However, the issue of extracting information from a single image remains largely an open problem (see also <ref> [38, 32] </ref>). Similarly to the approach for obtaining invariant functions of views, we treat a subset of our variables as constants. In this case the space coordinates are constants, which means that additional views would be required for eliminating those constants.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we approach 3D-from-2D geometry issues in a general and unified manner. The approach relies on tools taken from symbolic algebra | specifically, elimination theory using Grobner bases (cf. <ref> [33, 5] </ref>, and for review of applications of Grobner bases for geometric theorem proving, computer graphics and robotics, see [12, 2]).

The notion of "view surfaces" that captures the N-view geometry can be found in special cases | 1D images in <ref> [34] </ref> and images under parallel projection in [13].

Reference-contexts: In the case of parallel projection we immediately have the following results: * The rank of the span of the points in R 2N (the 2N coordinates of each projected 3D point) is 3 <ref> [35] </ref>. * The invariant functions (matching constraints) across views are linear [36, 23]. * Segmentation of separately moving bodies can be done by segmenting the points in R 2N into 3D hyperplanes, for example, using a Hough trans form.

The elimination approach can be applied also to shading and color domains as well. <p> The case of N &gt; 2 readily shows the existence of linear functions of views | which is the result of <ref> [36] </ref> (also [23] contains an alternative derivation of the same result). <p> Taking the case of n = 5 further we have that the vector of coefficients ff is the solution of the system Aff = 0 where A = [P 1 ; :::; P 5 ]. This provides another route to epipolar geometry and the linear combination of views of <ref> [36] </ref>. 11 Summary We have seen that by recasting the camera equations as an elimination problem (looking for projections of the general variety defined by the original equations onto lower dimensional varieties), many of the current and previously solved problems related to geometric invariants become very simple.

Reference-contexts: Invariant trilinear functions of 3 views come in linearly independent sets of 4 functions, have 27 distinct coefficients, and can be recovered linearly from 7 points [28]. The minimal number of algebraically independent functions of 3 views is 3 <ref> [37] </ref>. The notion of "view surfaces" that captures the N-view geometry can be found in special cases | 1D images in [34] and images under parallel projection in [13]. In this paper we approach 3D-from-2D geometry issues in a general and unified manner. <p> For example, we have 3 independent functions for N = 3 views | a result previously noted in <ref> [37] </ref>. Note that these functions are not necessarily the epipolar constraints. <p> It is known that, first, three views are necessary for reconstruction of lines, and 9 corresponding lines are required in the process <ref> [17, 37] </ref>. Second, the linear methods require 13 matching lines across three views [10, 39, 31, 22]. A line in 3D requires 4 parameters, and its projection in 2D requires two parameters. Let l denote the number of lines.

Reference-contexts: One case that has been treated is to assume existence of bilateral symmetry of our 3D point set [19, 24, 26, 18].
