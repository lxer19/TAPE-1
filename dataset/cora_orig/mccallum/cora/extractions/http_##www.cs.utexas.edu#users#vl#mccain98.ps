Title: Fast Satisfiability Planning with Causal Theories (DRAFT)  
Author: Norman McCain and Hudson Turner

Affiliation: Department of Computer Sciences University of Texas at  
Abstract: A previous paper introduced the nonmono-tonic formalism of causal theories, along with a general method for representing action domains in it. Here we show that causal action theories provide a basis for effective planning. We identify a class of causal action theories for which (i) there is a concise translation into classical logic, and (ii) the models of the resulting classical theories correspond to valid plans. These results enable satisfi-ability planning (in the sense of Kautz and Selman) on the basis of action formalizations that include indirect effects of actions (ramifications), implied action preconditions (qualifications), concurrent actions, and other features of action domains. Causal theories representing the large blocks world and logistics planning problems from [Kautz and Selman, 1996] are solved relatively quickly, demon strating the effectiveness of our approach.

Reference-contexts: For this purpose it is essential that a systematic solver be used. In Table 3, we re 7 Kautz and Selman considered two kinds of descriptions of the logistics domains (both in classical propositional logic): one based on intuitions underlying the planner Graphplan <ref> [Blum and Furst, 1995] </ref>; the other obtained by first describing the domain as in explanation closure, then eliminating all action atoms. In this second case, a satisfying interpretation does not include an action history. Rather it provides, as it were, a refinement of the planning problem.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION The language of causal theories is a simple nonmono-tonic formalism, intended for representing the conditions under which facts are caused. The formalism was introduced in <ref> [McCain and Turner, 1997] </ref>, along with a general method for representing action domains as causal theories. In the current paper, we describe an implemented approach to satisfiability planning [Kautz and Selman, 1992, 1996], which is based on a translation from the "definite" subclass of causal theories into classical propositional logic. <p> Let D be a causal theory. An interpretation I is causally explained according to D if I is the unique model of D I . As discussed in <ref> [McCain and Turner, 1997] </ref>, this definition reflects a principle of "universal causation": we require that the causal theory describe a sufficient condition for the truth or falsity of each atom in a causally explained interpretation to be caused. <p> Falseg ; lcomp (D 2 ) = fp p; :p :pg ; lcomp (D 3 ) = lcomp (D 2 ) [ fq q; :q pg ; lcomp (D 4 ) = lcomp (D 3 ) [ f:pg : The following proposition generalizes slightly a result presented without proof in <ref> [McCain and Turner, 1997] </ref>. Proposition 1 An intepretation I is causally explained according to a definite causal theory D if and only if I is a model of lcomp (D). Proof. Assume I = D I . <p> Intuitively, its truth is taken to be caused by its persistence. The fourth schema is similar. Taken together, these schemas can be understood to solve the frame problem for inertial fluents. 2 The family of standard schemas presented here differs from that of <ref> [McCain and Turner, 1997] </ref>. In general, the range of available standard schemas will increase as useful assumptions and appropriate means of expression are identified. Here we focus on standard schemas especially useful in definite causal theories. The fluent name Dangerous will be designated true-by-default.
