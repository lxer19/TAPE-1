Reference-contexts: Friction compensation for robotic manipulators is addressed by other researchers. Canudas de Wit [16, 18, 17], and Walrath [69] have tested adaptive friction compensation schemes for robotic manipulators. Adams and Payandeh provides methods for low-velocity friction compensation <ref> [1] </ref>, and Cai and Song successfully compensated for stick slip friction [9]. Finally, Bona and Indri [6], and De Carli et al. [10] are among the researchers who have used friction compensation techniques in practice. 1.4. Outline of this Report. This Report is composed of four sections. <p> Moreover, the velocity signal is always contaminated with noise, and at low velocity several unrealistic zero crossing may appear. To avoid chattering in friction-compensation, a threshold velocity was introduced in the literature <ref> [1, 2, 38] </ref> to smooth the hard nonlinearity of Coulomb friction.

Reference-contexts: A well known approximation introduced in the literature is the mixed-sensitivity problem which is the topic of the next section. We used the mixed-sensitivity problem in the context of this thesis for controller design, since there is a reliable software implemented in the form of Matlab toolboxes <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.6. Mixed-Sensitivity Problem. <p> Doyle et al. [19], presented a solution to the general mixed-sensitivity problem in 1989 using state-space representations. The -synthesis Toolbox of Mat-lab incorporates this solution <ref> [3] </ref>. Here we present only the system representation used to solve the problem and leave the technical details to [19, 23]. plant G, z is the vector of regulated outputs, y is the vector of measured outputs, and u is the vector of control inputs to the plant. <p> The solution to mixed-sensitivity problem involves the solution of two algebraic Riccati equations, each with the same order as the generalized plant G, and further gives feasible controllers also with this order. The implementation of this solution 2 in -synthesis toolbox of Matlab <ref> [3] </ref>, provides iteration in fl using the bisection method, in an effort to approach the optimal H 1 solution. <p> Doyle et al. [19], provided the sub-optimal solution for this problem in 1989, in which C (s) will be selected such that kT y d z k 1 &lt; 1. The -synthesis toolbox of Matlab uses this algorithm iteratively to find the best sub-optimal solution achievable <ref> [3] </ref>. Performance-weighting functions are selected considering the physical limitations of the system. The actuator saturation-weighting function W u is considered to be a constant, so that the maximum expected input never saturates the actuator. Its value is estimated to be 0:004 for the system under constrained-motion, and 0:002 for free-motion.

Reference-contexts: In the absence of the measurement noise, the transfer functions from the desired output y d , and the disturbance d to the output y can be derived from <ref> [4] </ref>: y (s) = 1 + CP 1 d (s) (13) hence, the error can be represented as: e (s) = y d (s) y (s) = 1 + CP 1 d (s) (14) The transfer function C (s)P (s) is called the loop gain and denoted by L (s). <p> Internal Stability. The internal stability of a the system can be assured by placing some conditions on the sensitivity and complementary sensitivity of the closed-loop system. Theorem A.1 summerizes these conditions <ref> [4] </ref>: Theorem (A.1): The system of Figure 18 is internally stable if, and only if, T (s), P 1 (s)T (s), and P (s)S (s) are stable. If P (s)S (s) is to be stable, S must cancel out the right half-plane (RHP) poles of P (s). <p> Limitations on performance originate from actuators, sensors, stability conditions and robustness requirements. Figure 19 restores the measurement noise, n. Equations 20 and 21 are valid here, but the effect of n is to be added. With all inputs, y d , d, and n it can be shown that <ref> [4] </ref>, y (s) = T (s)y d (s) + S (s)d (s) T (s)n (s) (24) In the absence of sensor noise, it is possible to simultaneously desensitize the system, attenuate disturbance, and reduce tracking error by making jSj small.

Reference-contexts: Figure 28 illustrates the block diagram of the system configured as a single-input multi-output (SIMO) for the H 1 - framework. As illustrated in x 3, tracking and disturbance attenuation objectives can be expressed as sensitivity S minimization <ref> [5] </ref>. For multiplicative uncertainty robust stability is guaranteed if the complementary sensitivity T has a norm less than unity (Small Gain Theorem [70]). T can be shown to be the transfer function from reference input y d to the output y.

Reference-contexts: The consequence is that the overall sensitivity is increased everywhere. If P has a pole and zero close to each other in the right half-plane, it can be shown <ref> [20] </ref>, that they can greatly amplify the constrains on S that either would induce alone.
