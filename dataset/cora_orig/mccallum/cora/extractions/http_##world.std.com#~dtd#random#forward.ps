Abstract: A computer disk drive's motor speed varies slightly but irregularly, principally because of air turbulence inside the disk's enclosure. The unpredictability of turbulence is well-understood mathematically; it reduces not to computational complexity, but to information losses. By timing disk accesses, a program can efficiently extract at least 100 independent, unbiased bits per minute, at no hardware cost. This paper has three parts: a mathematical argument tracing our RNG's randomness to a formal definition of turbulence's unpredictability, a novel use of the

Reference-contexts: Oversized mockups have clarified the various turbulent flow regimes inside a disk drive, and have shown how rotational speed, disk spacing, and cooling flow affect the flow <ref> [1] </ref>. The apparatus was a stack of 1-meter glass disks, spun in a water tank at low speeds (5 - 60 rpm). A close-fitting cylindrical shroud enclosed the disks, and 50 cm.-diameter hubs separated them, to closely model typical modern disk drives of various sizes. <p> Numerical simulation of disk flow showed similar turbulence patterns [21], and yielded an estimate of 3% for the consequent fluctuations in the windage torque. This is clearly large enough to influence the disk's speed. Spectral measurements of the fluid velocity showed both sharp peaks and broadband features <ref> [1] </ref>, reflecting weak turbulence: very noisy motion with a periodic component [3]. The spectra were taken at various rotational speeds, but the peaks always contained only a small proportion of the spectral power, rising only a factor of 2-3 above the white-noise background. <p> In a "worst-case" experimental scenario, we have measured 100 bits/min of entropy in a quiescent disk's speed variation. We have also sketched a mathematical justification for our claim that our generator's product is truly random. In summary, 1. Disk drives have Taylor-Couette turbulence <ref> [1] </ref>; 2. The N.R.T. theorem applies to Taylor-Couette turbulence [9]; 3. N.R.T. theorem ) Sensitive dependence on initial conditions [14]; 4. SDIC ) cumulants decay [Section 3]; 5. Cumulants decay ) independent, normal spectra [7]. Turbulence's unpredictability is formally and experimentally well-founded in nonlinear dynamics.

Reference-contexts: The classic Taylor-Couette (T-C) flow experiment models a disk drive's dominant turbulence pretty well: a tall cylinder spins inside a fluid-filled glass sleeve, which displays the fluid's toroidal convection.

The flow changed from periodic to quasiperiodic, and then abruptly to weakly turbulent, as the fluid's velocity was gradually increased. <p> We have also sketched a mathematical justification for our claim that our generator's product is truly random.

Reference-contexts: Our random number generator, which is based on disk-speed variations, 4 addresses each of these problems. Timing data are very low-cost, easily whitened, reliable, and mathematically noisy. I/O randomness is well-known in cryptography [17], and a spinning-disk RNG was used even 50 years ago <ref> [11] </ref>. Still, our approach is subtly novel, because a disk drive combines three important features most economically. First, the OS detects and reports disk faults, so that silent randomness failures are unlikely. Second, unlike most other I/O devices, the disk can be secured from outside influence and measurement.

Reference-contexts: The flow changed from periodic to quasiperiodic, and then abruptly to weakly turbulent, as the fluid's velocity was gradually increased. This development was consistent with a formal model of weak turbulence in simple quasiperiodic systems: Theorem 1 (Newhouse, Ruelle, Takens, 1978 <ref> [14] </ref>). "Let v be a constant vector field on the torus T n = IR n =ZZ n . If n 3, every C 2 neighborhood of v contains a vector field v 0 with a strange Axiom A attractor. <p> We claim that disk access-times satisfy Assumption 2. No statistical test can justify such a claim, so we will argue instead that the cumulants' decay follows from SDIC.

Reference-contexts: torus T n does not represent the toroidal T-C vortices directly, but is a simple dynamical system's phase space. "Axiom A" 5 refers to a formal definition of dynamical systems that show a close mixture of periodic and turbulent behavior. (For the definition of Axiom A flows and attractors, see <ref> [15] </ref>.) 5 The finite-dimensional Axiom A formalism can't apply directly to Navier-Stokes infinite-dimensional phase flows.

Numerical simulation of disk flow showed similar turbulence patterns <ref> [21] </ref>, and yielded an estimate of 3% for the consequent fluctuations in the windage torque.
