Title: A Study on the Utility of Using Expected Quality Level as a Design for Testability Metric  
Author: Douglas Williams F. Joel Ferguson Tracy Larrabee 
Abstract: This paper develops a Physical Design for Test (PDFT) metric that is directly related to the expected quality level (QL) contribution of a cell to a circuit, and it details experimental results showing the usefulness of this metric in predicting the quality level contribution of a cell to circuits that have yet to be designed.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The purpose of physical design for test (PDFT) is to allow IC manufacturers to increase the quality of a shipped product; more formally, to increase the quality level, the fraction of shipped circuits that are fault-free. Traditional approaches to improving quality level have focused on ease-of-detection <ref> [2, 3, 6, 7] </ref>, but the likelihood of occurrence of potential faults is also important: Physical design for test addresses both of these factors.

Reference-contexts: Since many design environments reuse logic units (those using standard cells or gate arrays, for example) and since faults internal to a cell can account for a significant percentage of circuit faults <ref> [4] </ref>, PDFT of the logical units or cells is an efficient means for quality level enhancement. This paper presents a method for computing an estimation of the cell's contribution to quality level and uses this contribution as a metric for guiding the PDFT of the cell. <p> expression relating WCA to fault occur rence probability, q C;1 may be written q C;1 = t2S (C) U t = t2S (C) WCA t I C t2S (C) WCA t U t For small values of the exponent, this is the same as the metric developed in by Jee <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. 4 Tools and method for PDFT Previous work described a system for computing the metric described above for a given test environment [4]: This section provides a brief summary of the tools and methods necessary to present our new metric. <p> t I C t2S (C) WCA t U t For small values of the exponent, this is the same as the metric developed in by Jee [4, 5]. 4 Tools and method for PDFT Previous work described a system for computing the metric described above for a given test environment <ref> [4] </ref>: This section provides a brief summary of the tools and methods necessary to present our new metric.
