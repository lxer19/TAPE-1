Reference-contexts: Manipulation with microelectromechanical actuator ar rays Next, we discuss our work on sensorless manipulation using massively parallel arrays of microfabricated actuators <ref> [1] </ref>. The single-crystal silicon fabrication process opens the door to building monolithic microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) with mi-croactuators and control circuitry integrated on the same chip. Our actuators are servoed to uniquely orient (up to symmetries) an object lying on top, and require no sensing. <p> When l intersects P, it also experiences a torque. This can be modeled as forces acting on the respective centroids of P on either side of l (see Figure 11). These forces are proportional to the surface area of each section of P. In earlier work we have shown <ref> [1] </ref> that every polygonal part has a small finite number of stable equilibrium configurations in such an actuator pattern. In equilibrium the forces and moments balance out, such that l becomes a bisector of the part, and the line connecting the centroids is perpendicular to l (see Figure 12). <p> This is achieved by a sequence of squeeze patterns at specific angles. As Goldberg [8] has shown for the related problem of aligning parts with a robot gripper, there always exist efficient multi-step strategies. We have extended his results for general manipulation in force fields <ref> [1] </ref>. poses after two subsequent squeezes. As an example consider the traces of a two-step strategy in Figure 13. The ratchet-shaped part is put on the array at two different random initial configurations. After two squeeze steps, the part ends up in the same orientation. 4.4.

Reference-contexts: Our experiments suggest that the system is very robust. 3. MPMD Manipulation Section 2 presents an implemented and tested SPMD manipulation protocol.

Reference-contexts: A system of robots executing this algorithm requires the following skills of each robot: * (goto hpositioni) to contact the object during the setup phase in the areas computed by the planner. (goto hpositioni) can be implemented by using a trajectory generator and a localization system, or even dead-reckoning <ref> [3] </ref>. * (push-track) to control the pushing-tracking motion of each active robot. <p> Our experiments suggest that the system is very robust. 3. MPMD Manipulation Section 2 presents an implemented and tested SPMD manipulation protocol. We now present an MPMD protocol called the Pusher/Steerer system. A detailed description and analysis of this sytem is given in <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. Despite conventional wisdom regarding the complexities of programming a multi-robot system, a key feature of the Pusher/Steerer system is its ease of use the actual robot code is simple and elegant, and yet there remains great flexibility in methods of path specification. <p> The Pusher's (entire) control system (Pusher) is obtained by the parallel composition of (align) and (prim-push). The skill (push-track) used in Section 2 consists of the sequential composition of (align) and (prim-push). In the language of information invariants, Brown <ref> [3] </ref> shows that (Pusher) = 0 (prim-push) + (align); (2) and hence, from Equation ( 1) it follows that (push-track) = 0 (Pusher): (3) We can synthesize the Pusher/Steerer system by redistributing items from the list above into two separate physical locations. <p> In these experiments, boxes and similar objects of varying size, mass, mass distribution, and material properties were manipulated along complex paths up to 50 feet in length. On the basis of these experiments, along with others which are described in <ref> [3] </ref>, we have observed the system to be quite robust in practice. Additional experiments using online navigation methods (human guidance in one case, and visual landmark recognition in another) have demonstrated the flexibility of the system.

Reference-contexts: Each individual actuator is approximately 200 m fi 300 m in size and can generate a force of with 5 m high tips (described in <ref> [5] </ref>.) up to 10 N. Clearly this is a strongly distributed manipulation task, as it cannot be achieved with an individual actuator.

All of our reorientation protocols rely on the ability of robots to execute push-tracking motions. 2.1. An Off-line, Global Control Protocol The off-line global control strategy denoted by global-offline requires three robots and is described and analyzed in detail in [17]. <p> Skill (I) is implemented by our virtual orientation sensor (align) described below. Skill (II) is implemented by a pushing primitive called (prim-push) described below. The skill (push-track) can then be described as the sequential composition of (prim-push) and (align). In the language of information invariants <ref> [7] </ref>, this implies the equation 5 (push-track) = 0 (prim-push) + (align): (1) We implemented the sensor for the termination of a pushing-tracking step (the "jamming" condition) by allowing the robots to detect impediment conditions thresholded by force [15, 9]. <p> This is possible because of the decoupling of the steering and pushing components of the strategy. * Finally, an information invariant analysis (see <ref> [7] </ref>) of the Pusher/Steerer strat egy reveals several formal properties, which we may express informally here: 1. The Pusher/Steerer system is exactly a redistribution of the same resources (computation, state, sensors, etc.) of a comparable single-robot manipu lation system. 2. <p> Objects of varying size, mass distribution, and surface friction may be manipulated by our system over a wide range of paths. For the purpose of illuminating the information and resource requirements of our manipulation system, we turn to the framework of information invariants <ref> [7] </ref>, which defines formal reductions between protocols. We say "Protocol B reduces to Protocol A" when we can use the resources (state, communication, computation, sensors, effectors) of Protocol A to build Protocol B. <p> While a presentation of the formal reductions between single-robot pushing and our 2-robot Pusher/Steerer system is beyond the scope of this report, we will pause to discuss those results informally. In his monograph on information invariants <ref> [7] </ref>, Donald claims that the spatial distribution of resources has a critical effect on the capabilities of a system. The Pusher/Steerer system validates that claim. Consider a single-robot manipulation algorithm such as, e.g., [11].

Reference-contexts: We employ a multi-step strategy in which we successively reduce the number of possible configurations in which P can be. This is achieved by a sequence of squeeze patterns at specific angles. As Goldberg <ref> [8] </ref> has shown for the related problem of aligning parts with a robot gripper, there always exist efficient multi-step strategies. We have extended his results for general manipulation in force fields [1]. poses after two subsequent squeezes. As an example consider the traces of a two-step strategy in Figure 13.

Reference-contexts: using the following steps: (i) Choosing a suitable velocity direction v specified as a relative angle to the surface of the manipulated object. (ii) Aligning to the object face using the relative angle between the robot and the object (which our robots can measure directly using a ring of contact-sensors <ref> [10] </ref>.) (iii) The robot moves in the direction v thereby applying a force to the object. That is, after step (ii), the robot's current heading is v. <p> Hence, graze terminates in (I) reacquiring the object at a contact with a longer moment arm, or (II) missing altogether. (I) is detected with a guarded move. (II) is detected using a sonar-based wall/corner detection algorithm of <ref> [10] </ref>. When (II) occurs, the robot executes (spin). In the setup phase the robots contact the object using the same procedure as in protocol synch-online. The robots may reach the object at different times.

Reference-contexts: We have described and analyzed in detail the reorientation task in [16]. Figure 1 depicts one robot reorienting a large object. A robot can generate a rotation by applying a force that is displaced from the center of friction. This property relates the dynamics and the geometry or reorientations <ref> [12] </ref> and it can be used to effect continuous reorientations with mobile robots. The idea is to compliantly apply a sliding force on the face of the object 3 . We call this action a pushing-tracking step.

Reference-contexts: Unlike conventional circuits, MEMS devices have an electrical and a mechanical component, i.e. moving parts that can be controlled or monitored with electrical voltage or current. Fabrication of our devices consists of a sequence of depositions and etches (called SCREAM process, for Single Crystal Reactive Etching and Metallization <ref> [13] </ref>) which define and partially release the structures from the silicon substrate. Thus, the devices consist of a single crystal silicon core, which is usually covered with aluminum, isolated by a thin film of dielectric silicon oxide.

The robot motions are shown in an object-fixed frame. Each robot executes a pushing-tracking motion. <p> This entails exerting a force in the normal direction to the face of the object while commanding a velocity in the tangential direction (see Figures 2 and 1.) This can be implemented with a hybrid controller <ref> [14] </ref> which servoes on the orientation of a face of the manipulated object. * (active-slip?) used by the stationary robots to detect slip at their points of contact. The value of this predicate is passed to the global controller which evaluates the termination predicate. 2.2.

An Off-line, Global Control Protocol The off-line global control strategy denoted by global-offline requires three robots and is described and analyzed in detail in <ref> [17] </ref>. The algorithm consists of a sequence of pushing-tracking steps, where one robot is active and two robots are stationary at all times (see Figure 2). A global controller sends and receives control signals to the robots. <p> The right sequence denotes three snapshots of the first step. The left sequence denotes three snapshots of the second step. The black circles denote stationary robots. The white circles denote active robots. A planner <ref> [17] </ref> takes as input the geometric model of the object we wish to manipulate. It outputs the initial contact locations for the robots and the order in which the robots become active, which is called the push-tracking schedule.

Reference-contexts: Such MEMS actuator arrays can be used as bulk-fabricated (cheap), ultra-thin transport mechanisms e.g. for paper in copy machines or printers. At the other end of the spectrum, recent advances have brought within reach arrays equipped with tips that can probe and move single atoms <ref> [18] </ref>. Such devices, employed in a massively parallel fashion, will yield tremendous data storage capacities.
