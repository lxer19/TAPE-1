Abstract: MACS-VRPTW, an Ant Colony Optimization based approach useful to solve vehicle routing problems with time windows is presented. MACS-VRPTW is organized with a hierarchy of artificial ant colonies designed to successively optimize a multiple objective function: the first colony minimizes the number of vehicles while the second colony minimizes the traveled distances. Cooperation between colonies is performed by exchanging information through pheromone updating. We show that MACS-VRPTW is competitive with the best known existing methods both in terms of solution quality and computation time. Moreover, MACS-VRPTW improves some of the best solutions known for a number of problem instances in the literature.

Reference-contexts: Real ants cooperate in their search for food by depositing chemical traces (pheromones) on the floor. An artificial ant colony simulates this behavior <ref> (Dorigo, Maniezzo and Colorni, 1991, 1996) </ref>. Artificial ants cooperate by using a common memory that corresponds to the pheromone deposited by real ants. This artificial pheromone is one of the most important components of ant colony optimization and is used for constructing new solutions. <p> In ACS, only the best solution is used to globally modify the pheromone trail. This updating strategy (Gambardella and Dorigo, 1995, Gambardella and Dorigo, 1996, Dorigo and Gambardella, 1997a, 1997b) has been proved to be more efficient than the one used in Ant System (AS) <ref> (Dorigo, Maniezzo and Colorni, 1991, 1996) </ref> where all the constructed solutions are used to update the pheromone trails.

Reference-contexts: 5.1. Introduction This chapter presents MACS-VRPTW, a Multiple Ant Colony System for Vehicle Routing Problems with Time Windows. MACS-VRPTW is based on Ant Colony System (ACS) <ref> (Gambardella and Dorigo, 1996, Dorigo and Gambardella, 1997a, 1997b) </ref>, and, more generally, on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a new metaheuristic approach inspired by the foraging behavior of real colonies of ants. <p> One of the most efficient ACO based implementations has been Ant Colony System (ACS), <ref> (Gambardella and Dorigo, 1996, Dorigo and Gambardella, 1997a, 1997b) </ref> that introduced a particular pheromone trail updating procedure useful to intensify the search in the neighborhood of the best computed solution. This chapter presents an ACS extension able to solve the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). <p> 1997), guided local search (Kilby, Prosser and Shaw, 1999) and large neighborhood search (Shaw, 1998); note that the method of Taillard et al., 1997 can also be viewed as a kind of large neighborhood search. 5.3 Ant Colony System This section introduces and presents the original Ant Colony System (ACS) <ref> (Gambardella and Dorigo, 1996, Dorigo and Gambardella, 1997a, 1997b) </ref> applied to the traveling salesman problem (TSP) Indeed, MACS-VRPTW has been proposed to solve a VRPTW where both the number of vehicles and the travel time have to be minimized.

Reference-contexts: One of the most successful exact approaches for the CVRP is the k-tree method of <ref> (Fisher, 1994) </ref> that succeeded in solving a problem with 71 customers. However, there are smaller instances that have not been exactly solved yet. To treat larger instances, or to compute solutions faster, heuristic methods must be used.

MACS-VRPTW has been tested on a classical set of 56 benchmark problems <ref> (Solomon, 1987) </ref> composed of six different problem types (C1,C2,R1,R2,RC1,RC2). Each data set contains between eight to twelve 100-node problems. The names of the six problem types have the following meaning. Sets C have clustered customers whose time windows were generated based on a known solution.

Reference-contexts: To treat larger instances, or to compute solutions faster, heuristic methods must be used. Among the best heuristic methods are tabu searches (Taillard, 1993, Rochat and Taillard, 1995, Rego and Roucairol, 1996, Xu and Kelly, 1996, Toth and Vigo, 1998) and large neighborhood search <ref> (Shaw, 1998) </ref>. The CVRP can be extended in many ways. For example a service time s i for each customer (with s o = 0) and a time limit over the duration of each tour can be considered. <p> most successful heuristic methods for the VRPTW are adaptive memory programs (see Taillard et al., 1998 for an introduction to adaptive memory programming), embedding tabu searches (Rochat and Taillard, 1995, Taillard et al., 1997, Badeau et al., 1997), guided local search (Kilby, Prosser and Shaw, 1999) and large neighborhood search <ref> (Shaw, 1998) </ref>; note that the method of Taillard et al., 1997 can also be viewed as a kind of large neighborhood search. 5.3 Ant Colony System This section introduces and presents the original Ant Colony System (ACS) (Gambardella and Dorigo, 1996, Dorigo and Gambardella, 1997a, 1997b) applied to the traveling salesman
