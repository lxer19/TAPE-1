Abstract: A stability cell is a subset of the configuration space (C-space) of a set of actively controlled rigid bodies (e.g., a whole-arm manipulator) in contact with a passive body (e.g., a manipulated object) in which the contact state is guaranteed to be stable under the influence of Coulomb friction and external forces. A first-order stability cell is a subset of a stability cell with the following two properties: first, the state of contact uniquely determines the rate of change of the object's configuration given the rate of change of the manipulator's configuration; and second, the contact state cannot be altered by any infinitesimal variation in the generalized applied force.

Reference-contexts: Most work has been limited to problems which could be planned without cell-decomposing the C-space. Two such problems were solved by Peshkin [29] and Brock <ref> [1] </ref>. Peshkin extended Mason's results on planar quasistatic "pushing" to plan spiral paths for a robot finger to localize disks in a horizontal plane and Brock planned rotations and translations of a soda can between two fingers and pushed by a third.

Reference-contexts: As will be seen below, these conditions are a vital part of our first-order stability conditions. 1 We study the specific case of only one manipulated object, but the extension to multiple objects is straight forward. 2 Nguyen refers to frictional form closure <ref> [4] </ref> as "force closure."

Reference-contexts: Dynamic effects are negligible. 6. There is only one object. 7. No uncertainty exists. Assumptions 1-5 are commonly made in analyses of robotic manipulation systems and experimental results support their validity, particularly in cases involving sliding contacts <ref> [5, 15, 26, 31, 38] </ref>. Assumption 6 is used to simplify the analysis presented here, but it may be removed by straight forward extension of the model. Assumption 7 yields a deterministic system model, thereby keeping the dimension of C-space as small as possible.

Reference-contexts: In future work, planning will be done in two stages: in Stage 1, plans for the nominal quasistatic system will be generated; and in Stage 2, the plans will be modified to make them robust to variations in the uncertain parameters as suggested by Xiao [45] and Dakin <ref> [6] </ref> and time scaling techniques will be used to allow high-speed execution [33]. Preliminary results on nominal plan modification when friction is uncertain can be found in [14, 38].

Reference-contexts: Thus, we have Y = X fi R n . Our development of FS-cells depends on the notion of a "facet" of contact space, which we refer to as a contact formation cell (CF-cell). Recall that a "contact formation" is a specific set of elemental contacts <ref> [7] </ref>. The CF-cell is the "facet" of contact space corresponding to a given contact formation. This is the subset of C-space for which at least 3 Referring to q and as vectors is not strictly correct, because X is not a vector space.

Reference-contexts: This process can be viewed as whole-arm manipulation and the planning aspect is in the design of the geometry of the manipulator (i.e., the arrangement of the fences).

Reference-contexts: The qua-sistatic assumption, Assumption 5, can be removed by the inclusion of inertial forces in the equilibrium equations (which then becomes D'Alembert's Principle), replacing the kinematic velocity constraints with the analogous acceleration constraints, using Dupont's results on jamming in dynamic systems <ref> [11] </ref>, and augmenting C-space with the velocity variables. The polyhedral body assumption in Assumption 1 can be relaxed by replacing the holonomic rolling constraint with the proper nonholonomic constraints.

Reference-contexts: In Section 3, our definition of first-order stability cells will be motivated from the point of view of frictionless systems and potential energy. The problems associated with directly extending that definition to systems with Coulomb friction will lead us to a modified definition based on Fourier's Inequality <ref> [19] </ref>. Then we will focus on the frictionless case (Section 4), in which the concepts of passive and active FS-cells will be introduced.

In the context of the dexterous manipulation problem studied here, Fourier's Principle is: an object in an equilibrium configuration with Coulomb friction is stable if the maximum virtual work is zero.

The problem of planning tasks of this type has been termed the "manipulation planning problem," by Latombe <ref> [20] </ref>.

We refer to these equations and inequalities as geometric C-functions; they include constraints which disallow interpenetration of the bodies and take into account their finite extent.

Reference-contexts: Using the suggested strict form of Fourier's Inequality facilitates the unified treatment of the frictional and frictionless cases, but testing a configuration for first-order stability with friction would require the global solution of a "mathematical program with equilibrium constraints" <ref> [25] </ref>. These problems are known to be extremely difficult to solve in general. Therefore, we will use the following definition of first-order stability that is easier to test and guarantees the satisfaction of the stronger form of Fourier's Inequality.

Reference-contexts: An approach based on our FS-cells could be applied to three-dimensional parts.

Reference-contexts: He considered a small number of primitive grasp geometries and control strategies for which sliding terminated by jamming in a fixed stable grasp.

This cone has its apex 2 distance units below the center of the bottom of the block and its edges are colinear with the outer edges of the two individual friction cones.

Our analysis of jamming for general three-dimensional, multi-rigid-body systems uses the compliance of the joints' position controllers in a similar way.

Reference-contexts: In Section 5, the analysis will be extended to include Coulomb friction and jamming. Finally, in Section 6, we will conclude with a summary and suggestions for future work. 2 Preliminaries The quasistatic model used in this paper is the same as the one used in <ref> [37] </ref>. For completeness, we will briefly present the relevant assumptions and equations below. 7 Consider a system of three-dimensional rigid bodies with n c simultaneous contacts (Fig--ure 2 shows a two-dimensional system, but we stress that our analysis is fully three-dimensional). <p> the vector f geo does not include f geoB . 2.3 Kinematic Velocity Constraints The kinematic velocity constraints, equilibrium equations, and Coulomb friction constraints are fundamental to quasistatic manipulation planning, so we introduce them briefly here and in the next subsection (for a detailed derivation with slightly different notation, see <ref> [37] </ref>). Let us choose a coordinate frame for every contact. The origin of the i th frame coincides with the i th contact point. The ^ n i axis is normal to the tangent plane and is chosen to point inward with respect to the object. <p> the number of joints, n ; g man is the n -vector of generalized gravity forces experienced by the joints of the manipulator; 0, is the zero vector, D i = diagf 2 i ; 1; 1g, with i the effective coefficient of friction at the i th contact (see <ref> [37] </ref> for the definitions of the W and J matrices). The normal wrench matrix, W n , appearing in equation (6), transforms the normal components of the contact forces to the universal frame. It's columns are the unit wrenches, w in ; for each contact.

In these papers, a particular dexterous manipulation system was studied. In the first paper, a planner was developed for the quasistatic frictionless case and a plan was generated to perform a particular dexterous manipulation task. <p> Preliminary results on nominal plan modification when friction is uncertain can be found in <ref> [14, 38] </ref>. Note that a dynamic model could replace the quasistatic one used in Stage 1, but then nominal plan generation would become more time consuming. Goldberg [17] planned orienting tasks for planar parts by a sequence of squeezing actions executed with a "frictionless" parallel jaw gripper. <p> Dynamic effects are negligible. 6. There is only one object. 7. No uncertainty exists. Assumptions 1-5 are commonly made in analyses of robotic manipulation systems and experimental results support their validity, particularly in cases involving sliding contacts <ref> [5, 15, 26, 31, 38] </ref>. Assumption 6 is used to simplify the analysis presented here, but it may be removed by straight forward extension of the model. Assumption 7 yields a deterministic system model, thereby keeping the dimension of C-space as small as possible.

Reference-contexts: The partial derivative with respect to the manipulator's configuration is proportional to, j in , the row of the i th contact's Jacobian matrix corresponding to velocity in the direction of the contact normal (see <ref> [39] </ref> for details). <p> Note that equations (6) and (7) represent dynamic equations of motion if g obj and g man are redefined to include inertial, Coriolis, and centripetal forces and moments. 3 First-Order Stability Cells The definition of first-order stability for a grasped frictionless object is given in <ref> [39] </ref> as follows: A grasped frictionless object is first-order stable if the object's configuration corresponds to a stationary point (i.e., an equilibrium configuration) of its constrained potential energy and if every (kinematically) feasible perturbation of the object away from the stationary configuration strictly increases its potential energy. <p> Equivalently, the virtual work of the gravitational force acting on the object for every possible nontrivial virtual displacement is negative. Thus it follows that the virtual work is negatively proportional to the change in the gravitational potential energy of the object. It was shown in <ref> [39] </ref> that the object is first-order stable if and only if a certain linear program has a unique solution. For this to be true, there must be 6 linearly independent contacts (three in the plane) with strictly positive contact force magnitudes.

Reference-contexts: The CF-cell is the "facet" of contact space corresponding to a given contact formation.

Reference-contexts: Also, in this case, the equations f geo = 0 and f phy1 = 0 define a cell that represents part of the boundary between the FS-cell in question and portions of C-space for which the object is either higher-order stable or unstable <ref> [41] </ref>. 17 4.2 Active Frictionless FS-cells When the number of contacts, n c , is greater than 6, then the elements of the wrench intensity vector, c n , are linearly dependent on the joint efforts, t (see equation (12)).

Reference-contexts: Notice that at the point x = 3=4 the active edges of the friction cones are all parallel, but that no pair of the cones (or negative cones) see each other as is required for frictional form closure <ref> [4, 42] </ref>. 10 In fact, only the cone on the finger and the cone on the left side of the block can ever see each other, and this first happens as x increases beyond 2.0.

Reference-contexts: Noting that in the frictionless case, W A = W n and J T A = J T n , trivially extending the quasistatic model utility conditions given in <ref> [43] </ref> to three-dimensional systems, and special izing them to the frictionless case yields the following two conditions that guarantee the uniqueness of _ q: Rank (W n ) = 6 (10) 9 E P 3 P I is nonsingular (11) where P I = [W T n J n E T <p> Thus the joints corresponding to t I should be effort-controlled, while the others are position-controlled. If the position controllers maintain their set-points, then their efforts will satisfy equation (14) (see <ref> [43] </ref> for more discussion). <p> As noted above, the conditions (10) and (11) and the inequalities of Corollary 1 are the quasistatic model utility conditions (specialized to the frictionless case) given in <ref> [43] </ref>. <p> Substituting equations (27) and (28) into equations (6) and (7) yields (see <ref> [43] </ref> for details): " J T # " t g man : (29) where c A , the applicable wrench intensity vector, has length 3n R + n S . <p> Note that effort-controlled joints do not jam; they just continue to apply the desired effort regardless of the motion of the rest of the system. 9 A detailed discussion of this issue can be found in <ref> [43] </ref>. 20 Consider a situation in which only one contact, i, is sliding.

Reference-contexts: His stable grasp criterion was equivalent to Nguyen's frictional form-closure 2 result for two-contact, planar grasps with friction [27]. These cases were sufficient to plan and execute the twirling task. Whitney's analysis of the peg-in-hole problem <ref> [44] </ref> was one of the first to consider sliding constraints in C-space. He did not pose the peg insertion task in C-space, but by formulating the problem symbolically, he analyzed the quasistatic mechanical model in contact space.

Reference-contexts: In future work, planning will be done in two stages: in Stage 1, plans for the nominal quasistatic system will be generated; and in Stage 2, the plans will be modified to make them robust to variations in the uncertain parameters as suggested by Xiao <ref> [45] </ref> and Dakin [6] and time scaling techniques will be used to allow high-speed execution [33]. Preliminary results on nominal plan modification when friction is uncertain can be found in [14, 38].
