Title: Optical Tracking for Head-Coupled Display  
Author: Kevin Arthur 
Date: December, 1993  
Abstract: Head-coupled stereo display refers to the use of a graphics workstation with stereo and head-tracking capabilities to provide the illusion of a stable three-dimensional scene located just in front of or behind the monitor. The recent introduction of workstations, such as the Silicon Graphics Indy, with built-in video cameras suggests the possibility of using the camera for head-tracking, thereby avoiding the purchase of extra hardware. This report will discuss the requirements for six degree-of-freedom video head-tracking for head-coupled stereo display, and describe a simplified implementation providing tracking with two degrees of freedom parallel to the screen face.

Most previous systems have used commercially available trackers, either ultrasonic, mechanical, or magnetic, and some earlier implementations used custom-built trackers, but few have used video input.

Reference-contexts: Most previous systems have used commercially available trackers, either ultrasonic, mechanical, or magnetic, and some earlier implementations used custom-built trackers, but few have used video input. Diamond et al. describe a system using a single video camera with mirrors to obtain views of the user from two different angles <ref> [3] </ref>. 3 Tracking The tracking algorithm works by tracking four coloured circles, 1.5 cm in diameter, placed on an 8 cm square piece of black card attached to the top of the stereo glasses (see Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: Various researchers have described solutions for determining the matrix M using linear estimation methods <ref> [4] </ref>[5][6], and Ganapathy [4] has shown that measurement of four points is sufficient to determine the six degrees of freedom, although for his case he was interested in solving for the motion of the object, which required two views in time of the four points.
