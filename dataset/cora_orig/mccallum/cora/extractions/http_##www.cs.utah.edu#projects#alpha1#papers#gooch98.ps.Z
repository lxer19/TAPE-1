Abstract: Phong-shaded 3D imagery does not provide geometric information of the same richness as human-drawn technical illustrations. A non-photorealistic lighting model is presented that attempts to narrow this gap. The model is based on practice in traditional technical illustration, where the lighting model uses both luminance and changes in hue to indicate surface orientation, reserving extreme lights and darks for edge lines and highlights. The lighting model allows shading to occur only in mid-tones so that edge lines and highlights remain visually prominent. In addition, we show how this lighting model is modified when portraying models of metal objects. These illustration methods give a clearer picture of shape, structure, and material composition than traditional computer graphics methods.

The extreme tone related to k d is a variation of dif fuse shading where k cool is pure black and k warm = k d .

Reference-contexts: Adding blacks and whites to a given color results in what artists call shades in the case of black, and tints in the case of white. When color scales are a blue-to-yellow and a dark-red-to-red tone. created by adding grey to a certain color they are called tones <ref> [2] </ref>. Such tones vary in hue but do not typically vary much in luminance. When the complement of a color is used to create a color scale, they are also called tones.

Reference-contexts: The various NPR methods differ greatly in style and visual appearance, but are all closely related to conventional artistic techniques (e.g., <ref> [6, 8, 10, 13, 14, 16, 20, 26] </ref>). An underlying assumption in NPR is that artistic techniques developed by human artists have intrinsic merit based on the evolutionary nature of art. We follow this assumption in the case of technical illustration.

Reference-contexts: Our work deals primarily with visual style rather than layout issues, and thus there is little overlap with Seligmann and Feiner's system, although the two methods would combine naturally. The work closest to our own was presented by Dooley and Cohen <ref> [7] </ref> who employ a user-defined hierarchy of components, such as line width, transparency, and line end/boundary conditions to generate an image. Our goal is a simpler and more automatic system, that imitates methods for line and color use found in technical illustrations.

Reference-contexts: This assumes the object color is set to white. We turn off the Phong highlight because the negative blue light causes jarring artifacts. Highlights could be added on systems with accumulation buffers <ref> [11] </ref>. This approximation is shown compared to traditional Phong shading and the exact model in Figure 11. Like Walter et al., we need different light colors for each object. We could avoid these artifacts by using accumulation techniques which are available in many graphics libraries.

Reference-contexts: When the complement of a color is used to create a color scale, they are also called tones. Tones are considered a crucial concept to illustrators, and are especially useful when the illustrator is restricted to a small luminance range <ref> [12] </ref>. Another quality of color used by artists is the temperature of the color. The temperature of a color is defined as being warm (red, orange, and yellow), cool (blue, violet, and green), or temperate (red-violets and yellow-greens).

This convention emphasizes that realism is not the primary goal of technical illustration. To simulate a milled object, we map a set of twenty stripes of varying intensity along the parametric axis of maximum curvature.

Reference-contexts: Edge lines are drawn in black, and highlights are drawn using the traditional exponential term from the Phong lighting model <ref> [17] </ref>. In Section 4.1, we consider matte objects and present reasons why traditional shading techniques are insufficient for technical illustration. We then describe a low dynamic range artistic tone algorithm in Section 4.2. Next we provide an alogrithm to approximate the anisotropic appearance of metal objects, described in Section 4.3.
