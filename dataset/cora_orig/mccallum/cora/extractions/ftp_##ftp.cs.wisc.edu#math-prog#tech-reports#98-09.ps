Abstract: We investigate the theoretical and numerical properties of two global optimization techniques for the solution of mixed complementarity problems. More precisely, using a standard semismooth Newton-type method as a basic solver for complementarity problems, we describe how the performance of this method can be improved by combining it with a tunneling and a filled function method. These methods are tested and compared with each other on a couple of very difficult test examples.

Reference-contexts: There are actually a couple of papers available which use ideas from global optimization in order to solve complementarity and related problems. Most of these papers deal with homotopy methods, see, e.g., Watson [28], Sellami and Robinson [24, 25] and Billups <ref> [3] </ref>. While these methods seem to be fairly robust, they usually need an enourmous number of iterations in order to trace the underlying homotopy path.

Reference-contexts: Later we will discuss the problem of what can be done if Step (S.3) becomes active. Note that the new termination check in Step (S.3) is related to the one introduced by Billups and Ferris in their paper <ref> [4] </ref>, where it is used in order to improve the global convergence properties of a QP-based method for the solution of complementarity problems.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we discuss the theoretical and numerical properties of two different global optimization techniques for the solution of mixed complementarity problems. The two techniques investigated here are the tunneling approach [20] and the filled function method <ref> [15] </ref>. We describe the influence of these techniques in combination with one particular class of methods for the solution of mixed complementarity problems, namely the class of semis-mooth solvers for MCP. As known to the author, none of these techniques have been used earlier in the complementarity community. <p> Sections 4 and 5 then describe the main ideas of the tunneling and the filled function methods. In fact, we also describe an extension of the original filled function idea by Ge <ref> [15] </ref>. We then present extensive numerical results in Section 6 and conclude this paper with some final remarks in Section 7. <p> This idea goes back to Ge <ref> [15] </ref>. In the following, we slightly extend the idea by Ge [15]. To this end, let us introduce a one-dimensional function : IR ! IR having the following properties: (P.1) (t) &gt; 0 for all t 2 IR; (P.3) (t) 1 for all t 2 IR. <p> This idea goes back to Ge <ref> [15] </ref>. In the following, we slightly extend the idea by Ge [15]. To this end, let us introduce a one-dimensional function : IR ! IR having the following properties: (P.1) (t) &gt; 0 for all t 2 IR; (P.3) (t) 1 for all t 2 IR. <p> The function P (; r; ) is called a filled function. If is the function from Example 5.1 (a), we obtain P 1 (x) := P (x; r; ) = (x) + r which is precisely the function considered by Ge <ref> [15] </ref>, whereas we get P 2 (x) := P (x; r; ) = (x) + r 1 when using the function from Example 5.1 (b). Generalizing Theorem 2.1 in Ge [15], we can easily prove the following result which explains to some extent the name filled function for P (; r; <p> P 1 (x) := P (x; r; ) = (x) + r which is precisely the function considered by Ge <ref> [15] </ref>, whereas we get P 2 (x) := P (x; r; ) = (x) + r 1 when using the function from Example 5.1 (b). Generalizing Theorem 2.1 in Ge [15], we can easily prove the following result which explains to some extent the name filled function for P (; r; ). Proposition 5.2 Let be any function satisfying properties (P.1)-(P.3) and define P by (8).

Reference-contexts: This is highly important because the right choice of a merit function may already avoid many problems with local-nonglobal minimizers since one merit function may have local-nonglobal minimizers which another merit function might not have. For example, it is known that the implicit Lagrangian <ref> [21] </ref> is a merit function of the standard nonlinear complementarity problem which might have local-nonglobal minimizers even for strictly monotone problems [29].

Reference-contexts: The interested reader can easily extend our results to other appropriate reformulations. In order to solve the mixed complementarity problem, we now apply a nonsmooth Newton method from Qi <ref> [22] </ref> to the system (x) = 0 and globalize it using the corresponding merit function (x) := 2 Note that this function is continuously differentiable everywhere [1, 10] with r (x) = H T (x); (1) where H 2 IR nfin denotes an arbitrary element from the B-subdifferential @ B (x), <p> the system (x) = 0 and globalize it using the corresponding merit function (x) := 2 Note that this function is continuously differentiable everywhere [1, 10] with r (x) = H T (x); (1) where H 2 IR nfin denotes an arbitrary element from the B-subdifferential @ B (x), see <ref> [10, 22] </ref> for a definition of this set. 4 Algorithm 2.1 (Semismooth Newton-type Method) (S.0) (Initialization) Choose x 0 2 IR n ; &gt; 0; fi 2 (0; 1); 2 (0; 1=2); p &gt; 2; and set k := 0: (S.1) (Stopping Criterion) If x k satisfies a suitable termination criterion: <p> Proof.
