Reference-contexts: Therefore, jS (A)j 1 + jS (A n f0g)j 1 + k ! This completes the proof. Let k 2. If A 0 = [0; k 1] and A 1 = <ref> [1; k] </ref>, then S (A 0 ) = 0; k !# S (A 1 ) = 1; k + 1 !# These examples show that the lower bounds in Theorem 3 are best possible. Theorem 4 Let k 2, and let A be a set of k integers. <p> + 2 = [(k + 1) 2 =4] + 1: These examples show that the lower bounds in Theorem 4 are best possible. 5 The inverse problem for S (A) Let k 3 and let A 0 = [0; k 1] and A 1 = 1 + A 0 = <ref> [1; k] </ref>. Since jS (A 0 )j = 1 + k ! 2 = jS 1 (A)j; we see that jS (A)j is not translation invariant. <p> Theorem 5 Let k 3. If A is a set of k positive integers such that jS (A)j = 2 , then A = d fl <ref> [1; k] </ref> for some positive integer d. If A is a set of k nonnegative integers such that 0 2 A and jS (A)j = 1 + k , then A = d fl [0; k 1] for some positive integer d. Proof. <p> Thus, a 0 = a 1 a 0 = a 2 a 1 = = a k1 a k2 A = d fl <ref> [1; k] </ref> with d = a 0 . If a 0 = 0, then A n f0g is a set of of k 1 positive integers, and S (A n f0g) is a set of positive integers. <p> Since S (A) = f0g [ S (A n f0g); it follows that jS (A n f0g)j = k ! and so A n f0g = d fl <ref> [1; k 1] </ref> for d = a 1 1. Thus, A = d fl [0; k 1]: This completes the proof. Theorem 6 Let k 3, and let A be a set of k integers. <p> Then p = n = m. Since jS (A)j contains exactly m + 1=choosen positive integers and exactly m + 1=choosen negative integers, it follows from Theorem 5 that there exist positive integers p 0 and n 0 such that the positive part of A is p 0 fl <ref> [1; m] </ref> and the negative part of A is n 0 fl [1; m]. Since 0; p 0 n 0 2 S (A) and n 0 &lt; p 0 n 0 &lt; p 0 , it follows that p 0 n 0 = 0. Let d = p 0 . <p> m + 1=choosen positive integers and exactly m + 1=choosen negative integers, it follows from Theorem 5 that there exist positive integers p 0 and n 0 such that the positive part of A is p 0 fl <ref> [1; m] </ref> and the negative part of A is n 0 fl [1; m]. Since 0; p 0 n 0 2 S (A) and n 0 &lt; p 0 n 0 &lt; p 0 , it follows that p 0 n 0 = 0. Let d = p 0 . <p> integers such that jS h (A)j is "small." Is A a "large" subset of some arithmetic progression? If jAj = k and if 2A denotes the set of all sums of 2 elements of A with repetitions allowed, and if j2Aj = 2k 1 + b 3k 4, then Freiman <ref> [1] </ref> (see also Nathanson [2]) proved that A is a subset of an arithmetic progression of length k + b.
