Title: DefibSim: An Interactive Defibrillation Device Design Tool

Abstract: We have developed an interactive computer modeling tool (DefibSim) for defibrillation device design. This system allows researchers to interactively design and place electrodes within a large-scale thorax model and then compute the electric and potential fields using an adaptive finite element method. Both visual and quantitative measures have been developed to determine the efficacy of different electrode configurations. This tool has allowed us to quickly and efficiently investigate over 170 different electrode configurations. A promising subset of electrode locations are now being tested in animals as well as in clinical environments.

Reference-contexts: More recently, computer models based on animal and human anatomy have attempted to assist in the design and placement of electrode configurations. However, these computer models were difficult to construct and previously available software tools were not designed for large-scale biomedical device design <ref> [1] </ref>. To circumvent the difficulties that exist in current defib-rillation computer modeling systems, DefibSim was developed to integrate the software tools used in the design, placement, and analysis of different electrode configurations. <p> Following the deformation and placement of the electrodes, a volume mesh was automatically created consisting of approximately 1.5 million elements (250,000 nodes) <ref> [1] </ref>. Dirichlet boundary conditions were then assigned to the electrode surfaces. Over 170 different electrode combinations were evaluated which required the construction of 50 different volumetric meshes. The finite element method was used to solve for the potential and current density distributions.
