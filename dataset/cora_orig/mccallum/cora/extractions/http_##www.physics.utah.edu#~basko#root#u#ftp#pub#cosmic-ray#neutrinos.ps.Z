Abstract: We discuss in some detail the production of extremely high energy (EHE) neutrinos with energies above 10 18 eV . The most certain process for producing such neutrinos results from photopion production by EHE cosmic rays in the cosmic background photon field. However, using assumptions for the EHE cosmic ray source evolution which are consistent with results from the deep QSO survey in the radio and X-ray range, the resultant flux of neutrinos from this process is not strong enough for plausible detection. A measurable flux of EHE neutrinos may be present, however, if the highest energy cosmic rays which have recently been detected well beyond 10 20 eV are the result of the annihilation of topological defects which formed in the early universe. Neutrinos resulting from such decays reach energies of the grand unification (GUT) scale, and collisions of superhigh energy neutrinos with the cosmic background neutrinos initiate neutrino cascading which enhances the EHE neutrino flux at Earth. We have calculated the neutrino flux including this cascading effect for either massless or massive neutrinos and we find that these fluxes are conceivably detectable by air fluorescence detectors now in development. The neutrino-induced showers would be recognized by their starting deep in the atmosphere. We evaluate the feasibility of detecting EHE neutrinos this way using air fluorescence air shower detectors and derive the expected event rate. Other processes for producing deeply penetrating air showers constitute a negligible background.
