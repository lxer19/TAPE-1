Title: Generalized Halfspaces in Restricted-Orientation Convexity  
Author: Eugene Fink Derick Wood 
Abstract: We introduce and study O-halfspaces, which are analogs of standard halfspaces in the theory of O-convexity, and directed O-halfspaces, which are restricted O-halfspaces. We explore some of the basic properties of them and outline their relationships to O-convex sets and O-connected sets, which are restricted O-convex sets, in two and more dimensions. For O-halfspaces, we prove that: Every O-halfspace is O-convex; if O has the point-intersection property, then the number of connected components of an O-halfspace in d dimensions is at most 2 d1 , and this bound is attainable; an interior-closed set with an O-convex boundary is an O-halfspace; and the closed complement of an O-halfspace is an O-halfspace if and only if the boundary of the O-halfspace is O-convex. In addition, for directed O-halfspaces, we prove that: Every O-halfspace is O-connected; if O has the point-intersection property, then the intersection of a directed O-halfspace with every O-flat is connected; the boundary of a directed O-halfspace is O-convex; if O has the point-intersection property, then the boundary of a directed O-halfspace is O-connected; and the closed complement of a directed O-halfspace is a directed O-halfspace.
