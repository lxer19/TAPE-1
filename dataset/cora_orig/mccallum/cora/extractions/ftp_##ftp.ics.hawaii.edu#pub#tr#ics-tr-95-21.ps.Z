Abstract: This paper presents the results from an analysis of a new computer-mediated communication tool called Flashmail. I investigated how people used Flashmail as well as Flashmail's relationship to conventional electronic mail. Participants in the experiment loaded extensions that gathered data regarding the characteristics of all messages sent through E-mail and Flashmail. This data was used to analyze the conditions under which each system was used. I found that Flashmail seems to be preferred whenever the message is short, needs to be communicated in a short period of time, and when both the recipient and the sender are logged into the system and active at the time of sending. In contrast, I found that E-mail was preferred for messages that were large (over 400 characters) and non-urgent, or when the receiver was either not logged into Flashmail or had been idle for longer than 7 minutes. These results indicate that Flashmail is generally used as a rapid, synchronous messaging method.

Reference-contexts: It was designed using Egret, a framework for computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) applications. Egret implements a multi-client, multi-server, multi-agent architecture. Egret clients and agents are implemented by a 15 KLOC extension to XEmacs, the X-window Emacs editor. Egret servers are implemented by a 15 KLOC system written in C++. <ref> [7] </ref> Flashmail is a real-time communication method complimentary to E-mail. Flashmail's main feature is that it is deliberately intrusive upon the receiver.
