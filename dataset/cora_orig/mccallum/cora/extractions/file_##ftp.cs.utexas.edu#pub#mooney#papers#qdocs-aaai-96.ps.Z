Abstract: Most model-based diagnosis systems, such as GDE and Sherlock, have concerned discrete, static systems such as logic circuits and use simple constraint propagation to detect inconsistencies. However, sophisticated systems such as QSIM and QPE have been developed for qualitative modeling and simulation of continuous dynamic systems. We present an integration of these two lines of research as implemented in a system called QDOCS for multiple-fault diagnosis of continuous dynamic systems using QSIM models. The main contributions of the algorithm include a method for propagating dependencies while solving a general constraint satisfaction problem and a method for verifying the consistency of a behavior with a model across time. Through systematic experiments on two realistic engineering systems, we demonstrate that QDOCS demonstrates a better balance of generality, accuracy, and efficiency than competing methods.

Reference-contexts: Each of these systems concentrates on different aspects of the monitoring process, but none performs multiple-fault diagnosis using behavioral modes. Some recent work by Dressler <ref> (Dressler 1994) </ref> performs model-based diagnosis on a dynamical system (a ballast tank system) using a variant of GDE. It first reduces the model to a version suitable for constraint propagation, and then considers only conflicts generated by constraints acting at a particular time.

Reference-contexts: Previous approaches to diagnosing faults in systems described with Qsim models have been limited in scope and have been unable to work with fault modes (Ng 1990; Lackinger & Nejdl 1991) or have made a single-fault assumption <ref> (Dvorak 1992) </ref>. Most previous work on model-based diagnosis (Reiter 1987; de Kleer & Williams 1987) has concentrated on static systems and is generally insufficient to diagnose continuous dynamic systems. <p> The main reason this system is of interest is to show that the Qdocs mode of dependency propagation is useful even for feedback systems. Some researchers (e.g., <ref> (Dvorak & Kuipers 1992) </ref>) have held that such an algorithm would not be useful in dynamic systems with feedback loops because variable values are usually dependent on all constraints. The level-controlled tank is modeled using a Qsim model with 45 constraints and a component structure with 14 components. <p> Future Work This work needs to be further extended and applied to a variety of different engineering systems. One important first step towards applying such a system is to integrate it with a monitoring system such as Mimic <ref> (Dvorak 1992) </ref>. This would require the use of semi-quantitative information which is likely to add more power to Qdocs. One area we have investigated but which could use further research is that of efficient caching of possible values of different variables during the constraint satisfaction phase of the algorithm. <p> Again, due to its dependence on the simple constraint propagation in Inc-Diagnose, it is only able to detect a small subset of possible faults which Qdocs can diagnose. The other previous diagnosis work on Qsim models, Mimic <ref> (Dvorak 1992) </ref>, has several limitations. First, Mimic requires the model builder to provide a structural model of the system in addition to the Qsim constraint model. This structural model was fixed and could not change under different fault models.

Reference-contexts: One solution to this problem is to use Qualitative Reasoning (Forbus 1984; Kuipers 1984). Our work uses Qsim <ref> (Kuipers 1994) </ref> as the modelling language and applies a very general diagnostic technique to models described in this language. <p> Qdocs's Diagnostic Approach Qdocs uses a standard diagnostic approach similar to that of (de Kleer & Williams 1989) and combines it with a hypothesis checker (and conflict generator) based on the Qsim algorithm of <ref> (Kuipers 1994) </ref>. Diagnosis Construction: Like Sherlock's technique for constructing diagnoses, Qdocs uses a best-first search mechanism and focusses its search on the leading candidate diagnoses as determined by their a priori probabilities. Qdocs maintains an agenda of hypotheses to be tested and a list of conflict sets.

Reference-contexts: We therefore expect the advantages of Qdocs to be greater for even larger problem sizes. Level-Controlled Tank: We studied one other system, a level controller for a reaction tank, taken from a standard control systems textbook, <ref> (Kuo 1991) </ref>. The main reason this system is of interest is to show that the Qdocs mode of dependency propagation is useful even for feedback systems.

Reference-contexts: Another system that used the Inc-Diagnose approach in the context of a monitoring system is Di-amon <ref> (Lackinger & Nejdl 1991) </ref>. Again, due to its dependence on the simple constraint propagation in Inc-Diagnose, it is only able to detect a small subset of possible faults which Qdocs can diagnose. The other previous diagnosis work on Qsim models, Mimic (Dvorak 1992), has several limitations.

Reference-contexts: The diagnostic architecture is similar to Sherlock (de Kleer & Williams 1989) and the algorithm builds on Inc-Diagnose <ref> (Ng 1990) </ref>. The system uses a general constraint-satisfaction technique to detect faults and trace dependencies in order to generate conflicts and diagnoses. A Qsim-based simulation component is used to verify hypotheses and detect additional inconsistencies. <p> An earlier attempt to use Qsim to track dependencies for diagnosis <ref> (Ng 1990) </ref> only used a simple propagator. Since the propagator alone is not complete, Ng's program, Inc-Diagnose is not guaranteed to detect all inconsistencies. <p> Further investigation will be required to formulate a truly efficient caching scheme. Related Work Compared to Qdocs, the previous diagnosis systems for Qsim models all have important limitations. Inc-Diagnose <ref> (Ng 1990) </ref> was an application of Reiter's theory of diagnosis (Reiter 1987) to Qsim models.

Reference-contexts: Further investigation will be required to formulate a truly efficient caching scheme. Related Work Compared to Qdocs, the previous diagnosis systems for Qsim models all have important limitations. Inc-Diagnose (Ng 1990) was an application of Reiter's theory of diagnosis <ref> (Reiter 1987) </ref> to Qsim models. Its main limitations were that first, like Reiter's theory, it was restricted to models where no fault mode information was known, and second, it used a constraint propagator that was not guaranteed to detect all inconsistencies.

Reference-contexts: Qdocs's approach to solving the CSP, based on Qsim's, is to first establish node consistency by ensuring that each constraint is satisfied by the possible values of the variables it acts upon, and then use Waltz filtering <ref> (Waltz 1975) </ref> to establish arc consistency, by propagating the results of the node consistency checker to other variables and constraints. Finally, Qdocs uses backtracking to assign values to variables.
