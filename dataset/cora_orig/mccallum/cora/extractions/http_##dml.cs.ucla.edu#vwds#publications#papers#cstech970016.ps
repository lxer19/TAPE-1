Abstract: Unsteady (time-varying) blood flow visualization motivates much of the research effort recently undertaken in Virtual Reality (VR) technology for medical applications. With continuously increasing resources for computing, simulation, and data acquisition, medical scientists are able to produce extremely large multidimensional and multivariate datasets with improving speed and accuracy. To ensure numerically stability, most simulations are computed using small time stepsize such that only a very small fraction of the total data change their values from one step to the next. The large quantities of simulated data are often stored in archives or databases on disk and moved to main memory during visualization. We are designing and developing a framework that supports an interactive exploration environment tailored to the particular needs of brain aneurysm specialists and directly assists them in accomplishing high-level tasks. We study a scheme that can exploit the spatial-temporal properties in simulated dataset to control the reconstruction fidelity based on the areas or features of interest. The scheme may automate and highlight the extraction of fluid topology where there are abrupt changes or local extremes, offering the possibility of investigating the position and illumination of emergency or disaster situations in an environment under a variety of conditions. Besides, this scheme should provide adequate support to offer substantial data reduction to permit local storage, and achieve considerable speedup in graphics rendering. The proposed framework defines a software architecture that needs to support computing and access to time-dependent data resident on a hierarchical storage devices, including a large-scale RAID (Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks) type storage server. The software architecture should scale and make transparent the location of data while satisfying run-time performance constraints. This architecture should also support exploration across heterogeneous hardware platforms. The UCLA's Virtual Aneurysm and Virtual World Data Server projects serve as the front-end and back-end application testbeds, respectively.

Reference-contexts: VIS-5D uses a five-dimensional array to store data in RAM. Data is organized as 2D arrays of 3D spatial grids. The 2D arrays are indexed by time and by model field (e.g., pressure or temperature). 14 * Bryson <ref> [1] </ref> uses virtual environment technology to examine time-dependent vector fields, although datasets must fit in RAM.

Reference-contexts: VR-based systems in medicine represents a paradigm shift in the way that will allow surgeons to evaluate and practice new technologies in a simulator before using them on patients <ref> [2] </ref>. At UCLA, researchers are currently building a VR simulation environment to help the neurosurgeon, radiologist, or vascular system specialist plan treatment of brain aneurysms, which are a weakening of the blood vessel walls that can expand like a balloon.

Reference-contexts: Specialists' job is to concentrate on the science, not become visualization experts. They allocate very little time to learning a new system and demand actual results within minutes of exploring datasets on that system <ref> [3] </ref>. Furthermore, specialists often want to explore their data and simulation in unique ways. These characteristics present a good chance to make visualization tools tailored to specialist's tasks and optimized for specific visualization goals.

Reference-contexts: Octree construction Octrees, like quadtrees, are hierarchical data structures based on decomposition of space. In quadtrees, space is recursively subdivided into four subregions [16]. Octrees are three-dimensional extensions of quadtrees, where space is recursively subdivided into eight subvolumes <ref> [11] </ref>. 1) Basics: We can spatially decompose the entire 3D volume into hexahedral and non-overlapping regions, called the voxel. Each voxel is atomic and represents the information with extent of variations about one single flow parameter which pierces that voxel. Voxels can be aggregated into super-voxels in an octree-like hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: The spacing between grid points may be distinct. The integer space of indexes into the array is known as computational space, whereas the real space of the x; y; and z locations is known as physical space <ref> [13] </ref>. Computational space can be easily divided by cutting each of the three dimensions in half, it is therefore much faster to build trees that divide the computational space as opposed to physical space. Typically, the number of grid points in our studies is several hundred or more.
