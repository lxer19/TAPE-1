Abstract: Image decomposition techniques such as wavelets are used to provide multiresolution representations of images. The original image is represented by several coefficients, one of them with visual similarity to the original image, but at a lower resolution. Several strategies are evaluated to store the image coefficients on parallel disks so that thumbnail browsing as well as image reconstruction can be performed efficiently. Disk simulation and experiments with real disks are used to evaluate the performance of these strategies. The results indicate that significant performance improvements can be achieved with as few as four disks by placing image coefficients based upon browsing access patterns.

Reference-contexts: It is therefore important to provide the ability to browse items and view them at multiple levels of detail or resolution. For the purposes of ADL, which is designed to handle mostly image data, the technique of wavelet decomposition <ref> [1] </ref> has been proposed for generating mul-tiresolution images. Using this technique, an image is decomposed into a low resolution copy or icon and several coefficients. The icon is the lowest resolution copy available. Higher resolution copies can be progressively reconstructed from the icon and other coefficients.

Reference-contexts: Higher resolution copies can be progressively reconstructed from the icon and other coefficients. The original image can be reconstructed from the icon and all the coefficients. In order to improve the I/O performance of browsing, we have investigated efficient placement techniques on magnetic disks <ref> [2] </ref>. The latency of disk access is reduced by fetching data in parallel from multiple disks. The study focuses on browsing access patterns when images are retrieved by similarity matching, where similarity is based on the content of the images. Two orthogonal declustering schemes have been evaluated.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction With rapid advances in computer and communication technologies, there is an increasing demand to build and maintain large image repositories. The Alexan-dria Digital Library project (ADL) <ref> [3] </ref> is an example of such an application. An image repository should not only provide access to the holdings but also provide the means for users to browse the contents of the library.
