Abstract: Controlling the rate of multicast data transfer to a large number of receivers is difficult, due to the heterogeneity among the end-systems' capabilities and their available network bandwidth. If the data transfer rate is too high, certain receivers will lose data, and retransmissions will be required. If the data transfer rate is too slow, an inordinate amount of time will be required to transfer the data. In this paper, we examine an approach towards multicast flow control in which the sender uses multiple multicast groups to transmit data at different rates to different sub-groups of receivers. Transmission rates for the multicast groups are chosen so as to minimize the average time needed to transfer data to all receivers. We present simple algorithms for determining the transmission rate associated with each multicast channel. Analysis and simulation are used to show that our techniques for rate selection and rate adjustment perform well for large and diverse receiver groups and make efficient use of network bandwidth. Moreover, we find that only a small number of multicast groups are needed to reap most of the performance benefits possible.

Reference-contexts: Hence we assume that the underlying network for data delivery is free from loss and error. We also assume that data can be delivered out of order to a receiver. A justification for this is provided in <ref> [9] </ref>. We note that this does not imply that data will not be retransmitted since (as noted above) a slower receiver may not have been able to receive a previously transmitted data segment due its rate limitations.

Reference-contexts: The key idea in this research is to improve efficiency through a TCP friendly congestion control mechanism using multiple multicast groups. Receivers are grouped on the basis of data loss correlation; loss statistics are used to drive the congestion avoidance algorithm. <ref> [12] </ref> has proposed the idea of splitting a set of receivers into mutually exclusive subsets in order to improve the throughput of positive acknowledgment based point-to-multipoint protocols. The sender carries on independent conversation with each subset over a separate multicast channel this is the simulcast approach described in section 4:1. <p> Second, we have proposed a nested transmission scheme that has been shown to achieve significant bandwidth gains over simulcast. Third, we have explored solutions with a restricted number of multicast channels, whereas <ref> [12] </ref> implicitly assumes the availability of an arbitrary number of channels. In the realm of reliable multicasting, there has been a proliferation of transport protocols targeting applications such as file transfer ([15, 16, 14]), DIS ([17]), whiteboards ([9]), etc.

Reference-contexts: The use of multiple multicast groups has been proposed for both error recovery ([10, 13]) and conges-tion/flow control ([11, 12, 13]). To the best of our knowledge, <ref> [13] </ref> is the only ongoing work in the design of multicast congestion control mechanisms for bulk data transfer applications. The key idea in this research is to improve efficiency through a TCP friendly congestion control mechanism using multiple multicast groups.

Reference-contexts: In order to achieve a clear separation between flow control and error control, we have assumed a loss-free network. It remains to be seen how our flow control approach can be combined with various error-recovery techniques. In particular, <ref> [20] </ref> shows that multicast losses in the MBone are spatially and temporally correlated. It may be beneficial to take this into account when grouping receivers ([13]). We have assumed that the sender has perfect knowledge about receiver rates.

Reference-contexts: It may be beneficial to take this into account when grouping receivers ([13]). We have assumed that the sender has perfect knowledge about receiver rates. Though we have not discussed specific mechanisms for gaining this knowledge, one possibility is to use to probe tools described in <ref> [21] </ref>. Also, we have examined flow control only for static, time-invariant bottleneck conditions. End-to-end rate control for dynamic variations in the network condition (i.e., congestion) remains an open problem. Finally, other types of long-lived applications and applications with data priority (e.g., whiteboard) need to be considered.
