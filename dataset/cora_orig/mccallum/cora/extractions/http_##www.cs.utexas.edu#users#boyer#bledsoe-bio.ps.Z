Reference-contexts: Two Ballantyne-Bledsoe projects are especially worth mentioning. A Biographical Sketch of W. W. Bledsoe 23 Perhaps the high point of success with the IMPLY prover is their work on nonstandard analysis <ref> [3] </ref>. In that paper, some very interesting theorems in intermediate analysis are proved, including the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem and the theorem that the image of a continuous function on a compact set is compact.

Reference-contexts: The usefulness of examples in finding proofs has been well known at least since the earliest days of geometry. A very few efforts at using examples in automated reasoning have been successful, notably the early geometry work of Gelernter. In <ref> [4] </ref>, Ballantyne and Bledsoe demonstrate the value of using examples in the area of analysis, especially topology. In that article is described a system, named GRAPHER, that constructs counterexamples as an aid to eliminating false subgoals arising in proofs.

Our review is literal in part because the authors of this biography lack the mathematical background to assess the work properly. <p> It is the principal purpose of the present note to show that this same conclusion can be drawn when the approximating functions are merely restricted to being neighborly. Bledsoe's Ph. D. dissertation, written under the supervision of A. P. Morse, is reported in <ref> [9] </ref>. The topic was "product measures." Concerning the general problem of product measures, Bledsoe remarks in [30] A Biographical Sketch of W. W. <p> The problem of defining a new product measure that extends the classical product measure and carries over this borel property has been approached in different ways . . . Among the approaches is that presented in <ref> [9] </ref>. In summarizing this work, Bledsoe and Morse remark One of our aims is to free topological Fubini theory from the usual restraints of local compactness. In this connection we shall regard Radon measures as very special indeed. <p> Boyer Bledsoe continued to pursue his investigations on product measures in the 70's. In [30] he and Wilks extend his Ph. D. dissertation work <ref> [9] </ref> by considering the case in which one of the two measure spaces is borel and the other is constrained by a separation of variables condition. In [17] Bledsoe, writing again with Morse, generalizes two well-known results from the theory of metric spaces to topological measure theory.

Reference-contexts: The one unclassified document that Bledsoe produced concerning his systems analysis work at Sandia is entitled "Program for Computing Probabilities of Fallout from a Large-Scale Thermonuclear Attack" <ref> [10] </ref>. The report presents a computer program for computing the distribution of fallout from nuclear weapons explosions. The program allows for variations in longitude, latitude, wind velocity, megatonage, and for such probabilities as one weapon destroying another.

Reference-contexts: I decided then and there to quit my job and set about spending the rest of my life helping bring this dream to reality. Bledsoe and Browning's initial contribution to artificial intelligence was presented in the paper "Pattern Recognition and Reading by Machine" <ref> [11] </ref>. Although the principal topic at hand was the recognition of characters, the entire topic of pattern recognition was clearly imagined. <p> Related work by Ullman on the Bledsoe and Browning n-tuple method may be found in [64, 65]. The latter reduces fourfold what Ullman terms the "storage gluttony of the Bledsoe and Browning system." Besides the basic n-tuple method, the paper <ref> [11] </ref> describes several additional techniques that were employed to increase the accuracy of character recognition.
