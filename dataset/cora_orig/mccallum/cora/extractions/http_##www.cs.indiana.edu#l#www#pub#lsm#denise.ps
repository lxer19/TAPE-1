Abstract: This paper presents a method for the transformation of Natural Deduction proofs into hypertext-like structured explanations to be provided by knowledge-based systems. First-Order Logic and a variant of the Natural Deduction system are taken as a basis for representing knowledge and reasoning over a generic classification domain. Information selection and restructuring are used to convert proofs into argumentation schemata. Our goal is to produce structured arguments that can be converted into Natural Language explanatory hypertexts which satisfy some pragmatical constraints. Thus, pragmatically motivated rules are incorporated to the semantic component of a friendly user interface language in which explanations are requested and conveyed.

Reference-contexts: We have also investigated how multimodal reasoning and explanation could be implemented within the basic framework of our system, taking as reference the Hyperproof system (cf. <ref> [Barwise&Etchemendy'94] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: One of the main features of the resulting explanatory structure from our method is a hypertext-like structure, in which chunks of sensible information are provided to users and expanded on demand. This is an important attemp at pragmatic adequacy <ref> [Leech'83] </ref> that we do; all transformations upon ND proofs are so done that the remaining logical formulas contain information that users can bind together in an inferential process that is natural to them.

Reference-contexts: But, as a general rule, we suggest counting the number of predicates occurring in the deduction and the number of "objects" referred to by the terms in those predicates. Both those numbers (and even their sum) should be lower than the "magical number" (5 to 9) <ref> [Miller'56] </ref> of items a human being can simultaneously consider. However, this pragmatical criterium has to be validated and more experimentation should be done before we arrive on a way to optimize the criteria to specific knowledge-based systems. <p> In general, the largest the proof piece the better the breaking point, as long as the resulting proof retains a manageable amount of information to be presented. The number of predicates and terms making up the proof should be within the acceptable limits (around 7, cf. <ref> [Miller'56] </ref>), whenever possible. A structural criteria to identify desirable breaking points is to look at the terms that appear in the proof conclusion.

Reference-contexts: (of the existential 9 and the disjunction _), whose conclusions are identical to one or more of the premises, the major premise (which differs from the rule conclusion) is the minimal (and last) formula of the branch, which has no introduction rule (in this we differ from the definitions in <ref> [Oliveira'92] </ref>). The proof piece is thus the whole subtree determined by a given breaking point. In this way all proof pieces have as their conclusion meaningful formulas (not the absurdity) and are valid deductions (although maybe not complete proofs) in themselves.

Reference-contexts: Recent results include a method for interpreting the results of the theorem prover in the case of partial or negative answers, with an analysis of the impact of the use of logical connectives in the context of cooperative interaction (cf. <ref> [Oliveira et al.'98] </ref>). We observe that the exact meaning of the logical connectives has to be taken into account when generating natural language answers from formal logical systems in order to avoid misleading the user.
