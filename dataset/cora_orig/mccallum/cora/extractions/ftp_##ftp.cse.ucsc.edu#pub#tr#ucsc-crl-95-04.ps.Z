Abstract: This paper describes two novel macromodels for incorporating the single and coupled transmission Lines characterized by the frequency-dependent losses into an S-parameter macromodel based simulator. This approach computes the moments of the S-parameter based upon the frequency-dependent parasitic functions: R(f), L(f), C(f), and G(f) which characterize either the single or the coupled transmission lines. These same moments can be used later to construct the macromodels. Once the macromodels are built, the transient analysis can be performed by using the Scattering-Parameter (S-parameter) based macromodel simulator.

Then the problem of finding the coefficients of the polynomials are transformed into one of the least-square error estimation. The Levenberg-Marquardt method <ref> [20] </ref> is used to solve this least-square error estimation problem. This method is chosen because it combines the best features of both the Taylor series expansion and the gradient methods. <p> Thus these diagonal eigenvalue matrices can be used to form the macromodels using a method outlined in the Section 2.1. Once the tabulated S-parameter data for the congruence transformation have been found, a curve-fitting using Levenberg-Marquardt method <ref> [20] </ref> is used to find the coefficients for the construction of the congruence transformer: X (f ).

This assumption is also adopted by Gordon et al. [13], Blazeck et al. [4] and Schutt-Aine et al. <ref> [24] </ref>. Gordon et al. suggested that the frequency-dependent congruence transformer can be found by performing the congruence decoupling at each frequency point, and by checking the orthogonality of all the eigenvectors for all the frequency points [13].
