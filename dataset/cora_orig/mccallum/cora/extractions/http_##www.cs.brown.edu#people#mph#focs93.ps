Title: A Tight Lower Bound for k-Set Agreement  
Author: Soma Chaudhuri Maurice Herlihy Nancy A. Lynch Mark R. Tuttle 
Abstract: We prove tight bounds on the time needed to solve k-set agreement, a natural generalization of consensus. We analyze this problem in a synchronous, message-passing model where processors fail by crashing. We prove a lower bound of bf=kc +1 rounds of communication for solutions to k-set agreement that tolerate f failures. This bound is tight, and shows that there is an inherent tradeoff between the running time, the degree of coordination required, and the number of faults tolerated, even in idealized models like the synchronous model. The proof of this result is interesting because it is a geometric combination of other well-known proof techniques.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we give a precise characterization of the tradeoffs required by studying a family of basic coordination problems called k-set agreement. In k-set agreement <ref> [Cha91] </ref>, each processor starts with an arbitrary input value and halts after choosing an output value. <p> Page 1 assuming n f + k + 1. This lower bound is tight, matching a protocol given by Chaudhuri <ref> [Cha91] </ref>. Since consensus is just 1-set agreement, our lower bound implies the well-known lower bound of f + 1 rounds for consensus when n f + 2 [FL82]. <p> In addition, the lower bound proof itself is interesting because of the geometric proof technique we use, combining ideas due to Chaud-huri <ref> [Cha91, Cha93] </ref>, Fischer and Lynch [FL82], Her-lihy and Shavit [HS93], and Dwork, Moses, and Tut-tle [DM90, MT88]. The synchronous model is a special case of almost every other realistic model, so any lower bound in this model holds in these models as well. <p> Thus, in the case illustrated above, there is no protocol for 2-set agreement halting in 1 round. We note that the idea of applying Sperner's Lemma to a geometric structure like the Bermuda Triangle has been used in previous work by Chaudhuri <ref> [Cha91, Cha93] </ref>. She also proves a lower bound of bf =kc + 1 rounds for k-set agreement, but for a very restricted class of protocols. <p> Page 4 4 k-set Agreement The k-set agreement problem <ref> [Cha91] </ref> is defined as follows. We assume that each processor p i has two private registers in its local state, a read-only input register and a write-only output register.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the lower bound proof itself is interesting because of the geometric proof technique we use, combining ideas due to Chaud-huri <ref> [Cha91, Cha93] </ref>, Fischer and Lynch [FL82], Her-lihy and Shavit [HS93], and Dwork, Moses, and Tut-tle [DM90, MT88]. The synchronous model is a special case of almost every other realistic model, so any lower bound in this model holds in these models as well. <p> The fundamental insight in this paper is that k-set agreement requires considering all "degrees" of similarity at once. We capture these degrees of similarity with a compact geometric generalization of similarity chains. We start with a k-dimensional simplex in k-dimensional Euclidean space <ref> [Cha93, HS93] </ref>. A simplex is just the natural generalization of a triangle to k dimensions: for example, a 0-dimensional simplex is a vertex, a 1-dimensional simplex is an edge linking two vertices, a 2-dimensional simplex is a solid triangle, and a 3-dimensional simplex is a solid tetrahedron. <p> Thus, in the case illustrated above, there is no protocol for 2-set agreement halting in 1 round. We note that the idea of applying Sperner's Lemma to a geometric structure like the Bermuda Triangle has been used in previous work by Chaudhuri <ref> [Cha91, Cha93] </ref>. She also proves a lower bound of bf =kc + 1 rounds for k-set agreement, but for a very restricted class of protocols. <p> The k + 1 points visited by this walk define the vertices of a simplex, and the triangulation B consists of all simplexes determined by such walks. For example, the 2-dimensional Bermuda Triangle is illustrated in Figure 1. This triangulation, known as Kuhn's triangulation, is defined formally as follows <ref> [Cha93] </ref>. Let e 1 ; : : : ; e k be the unit vectors; that is, e i is the vector (0; : : : ; 1; : : : ; 0) with a single 1 in the ith coordinate.
