Title: Transfer Equations in Global Illumination  
Author: James Arvo 
Affiliation: Program of Computer Graphics Cornell University  
Abstract: The purpose of these notes is to describe some of the physical and mathematical properties of the equations occurring in global illumination. We first examine the physical assumptions that make the particle model of light an appropriate paradigm for computer graphics and then derive a balance equation for photons. In doing this we establish connections with the field of radiative transfer and its more abstract counterpart, transport theory. The resulting balance equation, known as the equation of transfer, accounts for large-scale interaction of light with participating media as well as complex reflecting surfaces. Under various simplifying assumptions the equation of transfer reduces to more conventional equations encountered in global illumination.

Reference-contexts: As a more practical matter, many numerical techniques have been devised in related fields, and these are only beginning to be explored in global illumination. A wide assortment of Monte Carlo techniques have been developed for neutral particle transport [27, 55] that are relevant to global illumination <ref> [1] </ref>. The concept of importance for view-dependent radiosity [54] is another example of a technique adapted from a related field [26]. In the remainder of this section we examine some of the the assumptions of global illumination and characterize the underlying physical model. <p> Because of the one-speed assumption, we need not consider other changes to the particle as a result of scattering. We characterize the process of scattering by the volume scattering kernel k. The function k is defined on R 3 fi <ref> [1; 1] </ref> such that k (r; ! ! 0 ) dr d! 0 is the probability that a particle at r moving in the direction ! will be deflected into the new direction ! 0 , per unit solid angle about ! 0 per unit distance of travel. <p> The volume scattering kernel can also be put into another form by factoring out the phase function P r (x) defined by P r (x) 4 s (r) 1 Transfer Equations in Global Illumination 1-16 where x 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref> encodes the cosine of the angle between the directions before and after scattering.

Reference-contexts: Studying the equation of transfer is an excellent way to build a bridge to the vast literature in radiative transfer and its direct descendants, and this is one purpose of these notes.

Reference-contexts: Ray tracing [61] and radiosity [13, 38] feature nearly mutually exclusive models of light reflection: each valid in itself, but incomplete.

Reference-contexts: These goals are by no means unique to global illumination.

The origin fl Copyright c fl1993 by James Arvo 1-1 Transfer Equations in Global Illumination 1-2 of radiative transfer theory is generally attributed to the astrophysical work of Schuster [48] and Schwarzschild [49] near the turn of the century. <p> The above derivation of the transport equation is one of many possible approaches.

Reference-contexts: As such, it cannot be a complete description of the physical situation in itself. A property of all differential equations is that they require boundary conditions to eliminate the arbitrary constants of integration <ref> [11] </ref>. Equation (16) is only valid away from surfaces, which are the boundaries. At the surfaces, collectively denoted M , we need to specify what happens. To express the boundary conditions, first observe that M imposes a natural partitioning of S 2 into two hemispheres at each point.

Reference-contexts: In the absence of this assumption, the rate of collision is itself a function of the particle distribution; a situation leading to a non-linear balance equation. This source of non-linearity is sometimes unavoidable, as in some problems of gas dynamics <ref> [14] </ref>. To preserve linearity in photon transport it is necessary to ignore effects such as interference, which imply photon-photon interactions.

Reference-contexts: Theories at the microscopic scale are usually needed to predict first-order effects such as local scattering and absorption, which then enter into the simulations at the macroscopic scale. For instance, the physically-based reflection model of He <ref> [16] </ref> employs wave optics to characterize reflection from rough surfaces, and this model can be used for global illumination [52]. For many materials with complex microgeometries, there exists a natural hierarchy of scales, with geometrical optics taking over at the point when wave effects become negligible [60]. <p> The integral transformation of equation (21) expresses the density of particles reflected in any direction as a weighted "sum" of the incoming densities, and the weighting can depend strongly on both the incoming and outgoing directions. See Figure (8b). This phenomenon is also known as directional diffuse reflection <ref> [16] </ref>. Note that if we allow the kernel k b to include generalized functions, such as the Dirac delta function, then we can write k b (s; ! 0 ! !) = F (s; ! 0 ) ffi (! 0 !); which subsumes the case of specular reflection.

Reference-contexts: Geometrical optics, on the other hand, deals with the large-scale behavior of light, ignoring the wave-related details of physical optics. However it leaves out too much. Pure geometrical optics is insufficient for global illumination because it incorporates no radiometric concepts for the measure of light <ref> [22] </ref>. For global illumination, we need to model visual phenomena; those that are observable by the eye or any instrument capable of discriminating light intensity and frequency. This is called a phenomenological level of description as it focuses on phenomena corresponding to percepts such as brightness and color.

Reference-contexts: Once emitted, particles travel until they suffer an instantaneous collision. For neutral particles, such as photons and neutrons, the path followed is independent of external forces, and the behavior of following such a path is called streaming. For photons this path is determined by the eiconal equation <ref> [28] </ref> which accounts for continuously varying index of refraction. If we neglect refraction, as we shall do here, streaming is in straight lines. Collisions imply interactions with matter, and can be further subdivided into absorption and scattering.

But why the emphasis on physically-based simulation? The answer is that we wish to accurately predict the appearance of a hypothetical scene, and by imitating the physics we might thereby approximate the visual stimulus of viewing the scene.

Reference-contexts: These goals are by no means unique to global illumination. Global illumination can be considered a subfield of radiative transfer, which is the study of the interaction of radiant energy with matter at the macroscopic scale <ref> [7, 43] </ref>. The origin fl Copyright c fl1993 by James Arvo 1-1 Transfer Equations in Global Illumination 1-2 of radiative transfer theory is generally attributed to the astrophysical work of Schuster [48] and Schwarzschild [49] near the turn of the century. <p> Because the principles of radiative transfer operate at a size scale large compared to the wavelength of light, and a time scale large compared to the frequency, it is essentially a phenomenological description of the behavior of light <ref> [43] </ref>. Thus, radiative transfer matches the needs of global illumination. Radiative transfer does not provide explanations of phenomena at the level of quantum mechanics or electromagnetism, yet it must incorporate information from these more detailed levels.

In this section we approach radiative transfer by first reducing the model of light to the bare essentials, leaving behind only abstract particles.
