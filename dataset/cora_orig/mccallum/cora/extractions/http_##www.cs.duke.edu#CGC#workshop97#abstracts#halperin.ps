Abstract: We consider the family of lines that are area bisectors of a polygon (possibly with holes) in the plane. We say that two bisectors of a polygon P are combinatorially distinct if they induce different partitionings of the vertices of P . We derive an algebraic characterization of area bisectors. We then show that there are simple polygons with n vertices that have (n 2 ) combinatorially distinct area bisectors (matching the obvious upper bound), and present an output-sensitive algorithm for computing an explicit representation of all the bisectors of a given polygon. Our study is motivated by the development of novel, flexible feeding devices for parts positioning and orienting. The question of determining all the bisectors of polygonal parts arises in connection with the development of efficient part positioning strategies when using these devices. Background and Summary of Results Let P be a polygon in the plane, possibly with holes, and having n vertices in total. We denote by V the set of vertices of P . For a directed line in the plane, we denote by h l () (resp. h r ()) the open half-plane bounded by on the left (resp. right-) hand-side of . The line is an area bisector of P if the area of P " h l () is equal to the area of P " h r (). A line partitions V into three sets (two of which may be empty): V " h l (), V " , and V " h r (). We say that two area bisectors of P are combinatorially distinct if the partitioning of V as above induced by the two bisectors is different. We say that two area bisectors of P are combi-natorially equivalent if they induce the same partitioning of V . fl Work on this paper by K.-F.B. and B.R.D. has been supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grants No. IRI-8802390, IRI-9000532, IRI-9201699, and by a Presidential Young Investigator award to B.R.D., in part by NSF/ARPA Special Grant for Experimental Research No. IRI-9403903, and in part by the Air Force Office of Sponsored Research, the Mathematical Sciences Institute, Intel Corporation, and AT&T Bell laboratories.

Part of the work on this paper was carried out while D.H. was at the Robotics Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, Stanford University. v 4 We assume that the polygon P is connected, and nondegenerate in the sense that its interior is connected. If instead of a polygon we take a set of n points, we can ask how many combinatorially distinct halving lines there are, namely, instead of equating the area on the two sides of a line we now wish to equate the cardinality of the subsets on either side of the line. This is the well-known k-set problem (for k = n geometry [8]. The best bounds known to-date for this problem are the recently obtained upper bound O(n 4=3 ) [5] and a lower bound (n log n) [9]. An obvious upper bound on the number of distinct area bisectors of a polygon with n vertices is O(n 2 ). In this paper we show that a polygon with n vertices can have (n 2 ) distinct area bisectors. See Fig ure 1. Note that the polygon in our construction is simple. We devise an output-sensitive algorithm for computing an explicit representation of all the area bisectors of a given polygon. In our analysis we give a more refined distinction between area bisectors (than the distinction by the partitioning of V ). We order the area bisectors by slope in the range [=2; =2), and partition the range into maximal connected intervals with bisectors of the same combinatorial equivalence class. We denote by = (P ) the number y Robotics & Vision Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, Cornell University. Author's current address: ALPHA laboratory, Dept. of Ind. Eng. and Op.
