Reference-contexts: This is quite a sizeable amount of data, and in order to robustly support such a broadband transmission, a direct sequence spread spectrum modulation scheme was adopted <ref> [1] </ref>. While there are numerous reasons for taking advantage of the noise immunity and potential multipath interference rejection of a spread signal, the decision to transmit a CDM (Code Division Multiplexed) signal has several significant side effects on the design of the receiver circuitry (see [2], [3], and [4]). <p> Table 1 is a summary of the specifications for the InfoPad Motivation 10 Motivation 90 DAC VCO I I ADC Transmitter VCO RF LNA/Mixer IF AGC IF Mixer Modulator 90 Receiver 60 mW 65 mW 40 mW 45 mW 165 mW 20 mW per DAC radio receiver design <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: While there are numerous reasons for taking advantage of the noise immunity and potential multipath interference rejection of a spread signal, the decision to transmit a CDM (Code Division Multiplexed) signal has several significant side effects on the design of the receiver circuitry (see <ref> [2] </ref>, [3], and [4]). Perhaps the most obvious is that each user must now receive and decode a transmit pulse that has been modulated with a pseudorandom code, requiring high speed signal processing to despread the information.

Therefore, the tele scopic cascode circuit in Figure 12 has been designed for use as an operational transcon-ductance amplifier <ref> [3] </ref>. The input transistors and cascode transistors (M in+ , M in, M ncasc+ , and M ncasc-) are n-type devices to maximize the bandwidth of the amplifier.

(Although at the time of this writing, the DSP block has been fabricated on a separate die. <ref> [4] </ref>.) Digital CMOS technology has advanced rapidly over the past few years, thanks largely to the impetus provided by the growing computer industry.

Reference-contexts: Also, since quantization noise is rejected by the spread spectrum processing gain, the resolution requirements on the ADC in the receiver are greatly reduced <ref> [5] </ref>.

Berkeley Ptolemy system have shown that an A/D converter with 4 bits of resolution (effectively 7 bits after de-spreading) is sufficient to bring quantization noise well below the interference noise oor <ref> [5] </ref>. As far as A/D converter technology goes, 4 bits could certainly be considered a fairly low resolution converter. Unfortunately, the spreading gain of the system also results in a 64-fold increase in sampling rate for the converter.

Reference-contexts: Down conver sion is performed in two steps before analog-to-digital conver sion -- requiring two local oscil lators, multiple mixer and amplifier chips, and numerous discrete filter components. Clearly, such a design does not lend itself easily to a highly integrated, low-power implementation <ref> [6] </ref>. The power consumed by each active ele FIGURE 1. Superheterodyne Transceiver Architecture Motivation 11 Motivation ment is included in Figure 1. The receiver alone consumes on the order of 750 mW of power, with a large portion of that going into the discrete A/D converters.

Reference-contexts: By designing low-power A/D converters in CMOS technology and by switching to a quasi-direct conversion architecture, higher integration and significant power savings can be achieved. A homodyne conversion can be achieved by subsampling the RF carrier directly <ref> [7] </ref>. By constraining the subsampling rate to be an integer divisor of the carrier frequency, the RF signal is converted directly to a discrete-time baseband signal.

Reference-contexts: In other words, the required comparator offset for a 1-bit per stage, 10 stage pipeline converter would be 2 10 = 1024 times less stringent than the offset required of a ash converter! For a full explanation of the technique of digital correction, please see <ref> [8] </ref>. 3.4 The Sample and Hold Circuit. Almost all A/D converters not only convert an analog signal into a digital number, they also convert a continuous time waveform into a signal which is discrete in time.

Reference-contexts: with small gain error VGA Circuit Design 40 Variable Gain Amplifier Circuit Design pipeline A/D require gain accuracy on the order of the resolution of the entire converter (in other words, each stage of an N-bit pipeline A/D must have gain precisely controlled to one part in 2 N ) <ref> [9] </ref>. However, as mentioned before in Section 4.2, the negative feedback provided by the overall control loop compensates for any error in the gain of individual stages of the AGC. Therefore, in the trade-off between gain and bandwidth, a lower-gain-but-higher-bandwidth design has been chosen.

Reference-contexts: However, a comparator topology has been proposed which achieves a very good combination of speed and accuracy and is shown in Figure 6 <ref> [13] </ref>. The comparator, as shown in Figure 6, has a single-ended input and therefore needs to be modified for the InfoPads differential system. <p> This could be accomplished through the use of a capacitive input sampling network included immediately preceding the V os V T V gs V T ( ) - W L DLoad Load -++= FIGURE 6.
