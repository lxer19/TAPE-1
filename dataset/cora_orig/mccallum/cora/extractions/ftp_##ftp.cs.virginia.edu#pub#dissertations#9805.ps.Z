Reference-contexts: For an application that requires reliable multicast, but no multiple source ordering services, more efficient and lightweight protocols are sufficient. The Xpress Transport Protocol (XTPv4) <ref> [4, 95] </ref> provides multicast service primitives that offer reliable and unreliable service for both single and multiple source groups. A central agent, called the multicast group manager (MGM), maintains a list of group members and traffic specifications used by the error, flow, and congestion control algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Efficiency is crucial since a large simulation must generate potentially millions of packets per second; thus, exact self-similar processes based on fractional auto-regressive integrated moving averages (F-ARIMA) <ref> [7] </ref>, alternating renewal processes [57] and M/G/1 queues [29] are precluded because of their computational complexity. 3.7.3 Modelling the Arrival Density The next step in M is to transform the path such that the arrival density matches the UVAnet stream.

Reference-contexts: For example, researchers have yet to analytically model a modern unicast flow control algorithm, such as that found in TCP, because of the complex, dynamic interaction with the error control algorithm, congestion control algorithm, round-trip time estimators, and network state <ref> [8] </ref>. Distributed multicast transport protocols, such as MESH, represent an even greater challenge to express mathematically due to the additional dependencies between the end-systems in the group. <p> The key advantage to packet-level simulation is that with careful design, accurate network performance characteristics can be achieved. The drawback, however, is that modeling each packet and each network element requires significant computational and memory resources. For example, at a minimum, a discrete event simulator <ref> [8] </ref> must schedule two events per packet transmission: (1) the packet must be queued in a local buffer until the network link is available and (2) the packet must be scheduled to arrive at the destination node.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, Cheriton's VMTP protocol uses the response from the server as an implicit acknowledgment. If the server response or client request is lost, the client will time-out and resend the request. VMTP does not address flow and congestion control. Ammar <ref> [9, 25] </ref> improves the latency of single source, bulk data distribution by "par-allelizing" the multicast stream. The protocol partitions the receiver set into subgroups based on throughput and delay characteristics from the source. <p> In addition to feedback service, recent research focuses on layered distribution of real-time data. McCanne [68] presents the receiver-driven layered multicast (RLM) protocol for distribution of hierarchically encoded [93] video streams. RLM uses a parallel approach similar to Ammar's scheme <ref> [9, 25] </ref>, except each band in the video stream is multicast on a different address. Thus, slow receivers tune into low-frequency image bands, whereas receivers with a fast connection tune into all bands thereby receiving the highest quality image.

Reference-contexts: The token circulates around the group and (1) allows a group member to send data, (2) informs group members of messages sent in the system, and (3) provides a total message ordering. There are a number of variants of the CM approach <ref> [10, 18, 44, 53, 67, 101] </ref> designed for specific applications and network environments. Ease of implementation and simplicity are the key advantages of centralized approaches. The drawback to centralized schemes is that network and processing overhead grows proportionally to the group size. <p> There are many extensions and variations of the CM approach. Whetten [101] presents the Reliable Multicast Protocol (RMP) which allows multiple groups, multiple ordering constraints (i.e., source ordering and/or total ordering,) and multiple reliability guarantees (i.e., reliable, unreliable or K reliable). Armstrong et al. <ref> [10] </ref> presents the multicast transport protocol (MTP) which further centralizes the CM algorithm by electing a "master" site to handle error control, flow control, ordering, and membership. All group members register with the "master" site as either a producer and/or consumer.

Reference-contexts: Chapter 6 presents our conclusions, summarizes the contributions of this dissertation, and outlines future research directions. 2 Multicast Transport Protocols: Previous Work Contemporary multicast transport protocols can be characterized based on the type of services provided, network model assumptions, target group size, and number of sources supported (see <ref> [11, 40] </ref> for a complete characterization). Transport services are the most discriminating of these characteristics, and can be roughly divided into three classes: (1) ordering protocols, (2) fully reliable protocols, and (3) real-time protocols. Sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 discusses previous work for each service class.

Reference-contexts: In developing M, we model a particular class of self-similar traffic called Fractional Gaussian Noise (FGN) <ref> [12] </ref> using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method developed by Paxson [79]. The advantage to a FGN process is that the degree of self-similarity can be expressed solely by the Hurst parameter. <p> The steps to the FFT technique are given below [79]: 1. Construct a sequence of values f 1 ; :::; f n , where f i = f (2i=n; H). The power spectrum of FGN, developed by Whittle, is given below by Beran <ref> [12] </ref>: f (; H) = A (; H)[j j 2H1 +B (; H)] (A.1) B (; H) = j=1 2. Multiply each f i by an independent exponential random variable with mean 1, creating a sequence f ^ f i g.

Reference-contexts: Jones [52] presents a data distribution protocol based on saturation (also referred to as replication) combined with negative acknowledgments for error control. More recently, Nonnenmacher [74, 75] combines a forward error correction scheme <ref> [13, 87] </ref> (FEC) with centralized retransmission to achieve reliable data distribution. <p> For network packet loss, redundancy-based error control, or Forward Error Correction (FEC), offers a low latency solution to compensating for some losses but at the cost of consuming 116 5.1. Introduction 117 additional network bandwidth <ref> [13, 87] </ref>. While source-driven retransmission protocols do not scale to large networks and large receiver sets, recent fully reliable multicasting protocols introduce a hierarchy of special multicast receivers that handle retransmissions locally and relay control information back to the source. <p> Reed-Solomon codes add h redundant packets to n data packets <ref> [13] </ref>. If any n of the n + h packets are received, then the original data can be recovered. In our simulation experiments, H redundant packets are added to each group of packets from N frames, denoted here as a FEC (N :H) encoding.

Reference-contexts: Real-Time Multicast Protocols 16 Bolot et al. <ref> [17] </ref> propose a scalable feedback mechanism for single-source, large scale videocasting in multicast data networks. The video source uses the receiver feedback to adjust the video data rate to match the available bandwidth in the network. Feedback is accomplished using sender-based polling with key-based matching. <p> Buffering on the receiver side protects playback from disruptions due to packet delay variations, packet jitter. Receiver feedback techniques <ref> [17] </ref> are effective in matching application data rates with long-term fluctuations in the available network bandwidth. For network packet loss, redundancy-based error control, or Forward Error Correction (FEC), offers a low latency solution to compensating for some losses but at the cost of consuming 116 5.1.

Reference-contexts: By increasing the number of significant bits in the mask the sender can control implosion, yet receive a response from every group member. Braudes and Zabele present the reliable and adaptive multicast protocol (RAMP) <ref> [20] </ref> for real time distribution of images. RAMP assumes a network with QoS capabilities (such as the RSVP [106] approach proposed for IP) and supports priority data. The priority information is kept within the IP header, thus RAMP requires router support.

Reference-contexts: Introduction to Previous Work in Multicast Transport 8 1.3 Introduction to Previous Work in Multicast Transport The first generation of multicast transport protocols rely on a central site for providing multicast service. Chang and Maxemchuck <ref> [21] </ref> (CM) presented an early transport protocol using a token-based approach. The token circulates around the group and (1) allows a group member to send data, (2) informs group members of messages sent in the system, and (3) provides a total message ordering. <p> Multicast Ordering Protocols 12 Chang and Mexemchuck (CM) <ref> [21] </ref> present the pioneer work on reliable, ordered mul-ticast protocols. The CM algorithm circulates a token to all group members. The site holding the token multicasts a sequenced acknowledgment for each message sent to the group, thereby creating a total order. <p> Section 5.4 gives our conclusions and discusses future work. 5.2. Distributed Retransmission Error Recovery 118 5.2 Distributed Retransmission Error Recovery Chang and Maxemchuck (CM) <ref> [21] </ref> present the pioneer work on fully reliable multicast transport protocol design. However, the CM protocol and its derivatives are based on a centralized design which does not scale to large groups [84].

Reference-contexts: The network elements (e.g., routers and switches) forward the message only on those links that ultimately lead to a receiver. The Internet protocol (IP) and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) are the two dominant network layer protocols in today's infrastructure. Their service models are discussed below: * IP <ref> [28] </ref> was originally designed to provide best-effort datagram service with no guarantees on delay, delay jitter, or drop rate. Researchers in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) are currently extending the IP protocol suite to offer QoS guarantees [19, 27]. QoS classes under development include guaranteed service which 1.1. <p> Thus, the routes between the end-systems are sufficiently distinct such that campus delays and drops create different performance characteristics for multicast group members located on the same campus network. We use the Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) <ref> [28] </ref> as the network layer protocol. The IPv4 protocol specification provides "best effort" datagram service; that is, the network makes no guarantees on throughput, transmission delay, transmission delay variation, delivery order, or drop rates. <p> Table 3.3 gives the network masks used to partition the aggregate stream into fourteen campus substreams based on destination IP address (for a review of IP addressing, refer to <ref> [28] </ref>). The table gives the percentage of packets that each substream contributes to the aggregate stream for the 2AM, 3PM and 9PM traces.

Although the application-level aggregation technique is highly accurate, it is not efficient enough to scale to large backbone network simulations, especially those designed to evaluate complex communication patterns such as reliable multicast.

Reference-contexts: A deadline-driven protocol for retransmission-based error recovery of continuous media data is presented by Dempsey [37].

S-ARQ performs well for point-to-point multimedia applications in a high performance network environment <ref> [38] </ref>. However, S-ARQ as described above will not scale to large multicast groups because the source must process every retransmission request for the entire group.

Reference-contexts: Chapter 6 presents our conclusions, summarizes the contributions of this dissertation, and outlines future research directions. 2 Multicast Transport Protocols: Previous Work Contemporary multicast transport protocols can be characterized based on the type of services provided, network model assumptions, target group size, and number of sources supported (see <ref> [11, 40] </ref> for a complete characterization). Transport services are the most discriminating of these characteristics, and can be roughly divided into three classes: (1) ordering protocols, (2) fully reliable protocols, and (3) real-time protocols. Sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 discusses previous work for each service class.

Reference-contexts: replicated filesystems, distributed databases, distributed simulations, concurrent processing systems, and cache coherence protocols. * Multimedia transport service: With recent advances in network technology, it is now possible to use multicast networks for high bandwidth multimedia applications such as audiocast [50, 90], videocast [39], group video conferencing [42, 99], distributed whiteboards <ref> [41] </ref>, interactive TV, and other multimedia systems (e.g., tele-medicine systems). In contrast to reliable multicast, multimedia applications are loosely synchronized groups that require real-time 1 data delivery, but not necessarily reliable delivery. <p> However, constructing such trees at the network layer is still an open problem. Alternatively, some protocols do not create an explicit control structure, and multicast control messages to the entire group. Floyd et al. <ref> [41, 49] </ref> use an unstructured approach called scalable reliable multicast (SRM) to provide transport service for Wb a shared, interactive whiteboard tool. Receiver feedback is accomplished by each member periodically multicasting session messages 8 . Session messages contain the highest sequence number received from every source in the group. <p> Constructing and maintaining efficient control trees, however, is difficult without resorting to manual configuration, network-layer support beyond current multicast services (e.g., subcast), or network-specific options (e.g., hop-count scoping) that have unpredictable effects. Alternatively, some protocols multicast control information to the entire group. SRM <ref> [41] </ref>, for example, uses a sophisticated timer man 70 71 agement strategy based on propagation delay estimates to control access to the multicast channel. Since transport services are not localized, unstructured approaches have a higher overhead and a greater error recovery latency, in general, when compared to tree-based schemes. <p> In terms of error control, the two key timing issues involve (1) when to multicast a retransmission request and (2) when to send a repair. In this study, we use the widely accepted error control timing-strategy pioneered in SRM <ref> [41] </ref>. In SRM, after a node (denoted here as A) detects data loss it schedules a retransmission request on the uniform distribution: [C 1 d S;A ; (C 1 + C 2 )d S;A ] (4.1) Where d S;A is node A's one-way estimated transmission delay from the source (S). <p> For each duplicate request received, a node reschedules its request using an exponential back-off. This approach works well when requests and responses are not dropped by the network (note that in the SRM performance analysis <ref> [41] </ref>, this assumption is made). However, consider what happens when a request is dropped. Some set of nodes missing the data will not receive the retransmission request, and thus will time-out sending its own request. <p> These protocols strategically distribute special nodes called designated receivers (DRs) throughout the multicast group. By hierarchically organizing DRs and endsystems, errors can be recovered locally between DRs and their children. Floyd et al. <ref> [41] </ref> propose the SRM protocol in which receivers multicast retransmission requests to the group and any group member can multicast retransmissions. The distributed protocols discussed above improve scalability to large multicast groups and wide-area network environments.

Reference-contexts: Eventually, links close to the source become saturated, thereby limiting data throughput. The scalability limitations have motivated researchers to consider protocols that distributed protocol processing among group members. One common approach is to hierarchically organize the multicast group into a tree-based structure <ref> [47, 62, 103] </ref>, thereby localizing error control and aggregating feedback. The performance of the tree-based approaches hinges on the ability to construct control trees that follow the underlying routing tree. Constructing such trees at the transport layer remains an open problem. <p> When a DR sends a retransmission via multicast, it only sends the message on the subtree. Thus, like RM, RMTP must modify network routers and routing protocols. 2.4. Distributed Multicast Transport Protocols 21 Holbrook et al. <ref> [47] </ref> present the log-based receiver-reliable multicast protocol (LBRM) for distributed interactive simulations. LBRM uses a receiver-reliable approach to error control but does not consider fault tolerance, flow, rate or congestion control (these are considered application-layer issues). <p> Second, the protocol uses a run-time algorithm for dynamic configuration of the control framework between the receivers performing retransmission-based recovery. This dynamic control structure enables adaptation to network traffic dynamics and exploitation of multiple physical paths in the wide-area topology, in contrast with static hierarchical control as in <ref> [47, 62] </ref>. Third, MESH-M is explicitly designed to work with multiple multicast data sources without building a per-source control framework. The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows. Section 5.2 covers related work and describes MESH-M. <p> Distributed Retransmission Error Recovery 118 5.2 Distributed Retransmission Error Recovery Chang and Maxemchuck (CM) [21] present the pioneer work on fully reliable multicast transport protocol design. However, the CM protocol and its derivatives are based on a centralized design which does not scale to large groups [84]. Holbrook <ref> [47] </ref>, Paul [62] and Yavatkar [103] use a distributed protocol design for achieving single source, reliable data distribution. These protocols strategically distribute special nodes called designated receivers (DRs) throughout the multicast group. By hierarchically organizing DRs and endsystems, errors can be recovered locally between DRs and their children. <p> While these performance and cost advantages come at the expense of protocol complexity within endsystems, MESH-M inherently requires less coordination overhead than schemes that set up and maintain per-source control trees, e.g., <ref> [47, 62, 103] </ref>. Furthermore, as compared with these other schemes, MESH-M is more robust to active receiver failures, adapts more readily to network congestion, and is well-suited for multiple sources.

Reference-contexts: Eventually, links close to the source become saturated, thereby limiting data throughput. The scalability limitations have motivated researchers to consider protocols that distributed protocol processing among group members. One common approach is to hierarchically organize the multicast group into a tree-based structure <ref> [47, 62, 103] </ref>, thereby localizing error control and aggregating feedback. The performance of the tree-based approaches hinges on the ability to construct control trees that follow the underlying routing tree. Constructing such trees at the transport layer remains an open problem. <p> For example, Figure 2.1 shows receivers at JKV, MSB, and AUB sending protocol control messages to the JKV DR. In turn, the JKV DR sends aggregated protocol control messages to the DR located at GIT. Lin and Paul <ref> [62] </ref> present the reliable multicast transport protocol (RMTP) which is based on the RM protocol and the DSG architecture to provide reliable, single-source, data distribution service. RMTP uses windowed flow control with congestion avoidance [48] to prevent overwhelming end-systems and network resources. <p> Second, the protocol uses a run-time algorithm for dynamic configuration of the control framework between the receivers performing retransmission-based recovery. This dynamic control structure enables adaptation to network traffic dynamics and exploitation of multiple physical paths in the wide-area topology, in contrast with static hierarchical control as in <ref> [47, 62] </ref>. Third, MESH-M is explicitly designed to work with multiple multicast data sources without building a per-source control framework. The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows. Section 5.2 covers related work and describes MESH-M. <p> However, the CM protocol and its derivatives are based on a centralized design which does not scale to large groups [84]. Holbrook [47], Paul <ref> [62] </ref> and Yavatkar [103] use a distributed protocol design for achieving single source, reliable data distribution. These protocols strategically distribute special nodes called designated receivers (DRs) throughout the multicast group. By hierarchically organizing DRs and endsystems, errors can be recovered locally between DRs and their children. <p> While these performance and cost advantages come at the expense of protocol complexity within endsystems, MESH-M inherently requires less coordination overhead than schemes that set up and maintain per-source control trees, e.g., <ref> [47, 62, 103] </ref>. Furthermore, as compared with these other schemes, MESH-M is more robust to active receiver failures, adapts more readily to network congestion, and is well-suited for multiple sources.

Reference-contexts: Since SRM is unstructured and purely distributed, it has a significant robustness and portability advantage over RTMP, TMTP, and LBRM.

Reference-contexts: Distributed schemes offer the advantages of low-latency recovery, restriction of individual retransmissions to only a portion of the network, and scalability to large receiver sets. This chapter introduces a novel distributed retransmission-based error control protocol for wide-area multicasting of time-constrained data streams. Known as MESH-M <ref> [65] </ref>, the new scheme extends the successful approach of distributed multicast error control in three key ways. First, MESH-M incorporates a retransmission model for delay-sensitive streams, decoupling the use of retransmission from a fully reliable service semantic and allowing the protocol to be tailored for application-dependent delay constraints.

Reference-contexts: The token circulates around the group and (1) allows a group member to send data, (2) informs group members of messages sent in the system, and (3) provides a total message ordering. There are a number of variants of the CM approach <ref> [10, 18, 44, 53, 67, 101] </ref> designed for specific applications and network environments. Ease of implementation and simplicity are the key advantages of centralized approaches. The drawback to centralized schemes is that network and processing overhead grows proportionally to the group size. <p> Each subgroup is assigned a central sequencing node, called a primary, which sends and receives messages for the subgroup. Primaries exchange messages such that subgroup streams are combined in a consistent manner as they are routed to their destination, thereby creating a total ordering. Maffies <ref> [67] </ref> also studies total ordering among multiple groups. Each subgroup is assigned a group transport service (GTS) agent, which provides a total ordering within the subgroup (inter-group total ordering is not addressed).

Reference-contexts: Error control is achieved using negative acknowledgments with selective retransmission. Flow and congestion control is achieved using a dynamic rate-based mechanism driven by source quench messages from routers and error rates. In addition to feedback service, recent research focuses on layered distribution of real-time data. McCanne <ref> [68] </ref> presents the receiver-driven layered multicast (RLM) protocol for distribution of hierarchically encoded [93] video streams. RLM uses a parallel approach similar to Ammar's scheme [9, 25], except each band in the video stream is multicast on a different address.

Reference-contexts: In developing M, we model a particular class of self-similar traffic called Fractional Gaussian Noise (FGN) [12] using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method developed by Paxson <ref> [79] </ref>. The advantage to a FGN process is that the degree of self-similarity can be expressed solely by the Hurst parameter. We choose the FFT method (given in Appendix A.1) because an approximate FGN sample path of length P can be efficiently generated in O (P log P ). <p> Since fxg has by construction the power spectrum of FGN, the sample path is guaranteed to have the autocorrelation properties of an FGN process. The steps to the FFT technique are given below <ref> [79] </ref>: 1. Construct a sequence of values f 1 ; :::; f n , where f i = f (2i=n; H).

Reference-contexts: These results are consistent with studies showing the self-similarity of LAN traffic which have estimated the Hurst parameter as high as 0:82 [57]. 3.7.2 Generating Self-Similar Traffic The literature gives number of traffic models that generate long-range dependent traffic (see <ref> [45, 57, 80] </ref> and the references therein).

However, the analysis in <ref> [80] </ref> shows that arrivals, when viewed at millisecond granularity, occur in bursts rather than a continuous flow. S models the short-term arrival using the well-known packet-train model developed by Jain [51].

Reference-contexts: The lack of correlation can be explained by the nature of statistical multiplexing in IP networks. That is, packet sizes are most often highly correlated as they are generated by the application <ref> [81] </ref>. However, as the network statistically multiplexes a large number of independent connections, the correlation diminishes. For example, Figure 3.13 shows that the 9P M trace has the most correlation, and the 3P M trace has the least correlation.

Reference-contexts: The protocols reviewed either do not consider scalability (i.e., were designed for small groups), or use mechanisms to reduce the number of messages between the central site and receiver set. For large groups, Pingali <ref> [84] </ref> shows that receiver-initiated approaches (e.g., negative acknowledgments, slotting, and damping) are effective control message reduction techniques. However, receiver-based approaches perform best when receivers "eavesdrop" on control messages sent from other receivers. <p> Distributed Retransmission Error Recovery 118 5.2 Distributed Retransmission Error Recovery Chang and Maxemchuck (CM) [21] present the pioneer work on fully reliable multicast transport protocol design.

Reference-contexts: These scalability limitations are driving researchers to consider distributed transport protocol design for large-scale, wide-area multicast. 2.4.1 Distributed Approach at the Network Layer One distributed technique is to push error control and state-feedback services into the network layer. For example, Rajapolan <ref> [85] </ref> presents the reliable multicast (RM) protocol which distributes protocol processing into the network layer to achieve reliable, K-reliable, and subgroup-reliable multicast. Error recovery is local between router pairs, thereby incurring low network overhead and recovery delay.

Reference-contexts: To desynchronize and reduce the amount of return traffic to the MGM, XTP uses slotting, damping, and polling techniques. Slotting is a technique whereby receivers randomly back-off retransmission requests. By multicasting retransmission requests other receivers can "damp" out redundant requests. Jain and Ramakrishnan <ref> [86] </ref> optimize the basic centralized approach by incorporating negative acknowledgments and periodic polling messages (NAPP) for single-source reliable multicast in LANs. Like XTP, error control uses negative acknowledgments (NACKs), slotting, and damping. To ensure forward progress of the sender, each receiver periodically sends a positive acknowledgment (ACK).

Reference-contexts: Jones [52] presents a data distribution protocol based on saturation (also referred to as replication) combined with negative acknowledgments for error control.

While source-driven retransmission protocols do not scale to large networks and large receiver sets, recent fully reliable multicasting protocols introduce a hierarchy of special multicast receivers that handle retransmissions locally and relay control information back to the source.

Reference-contexts: A gather operation allows sources to efficiently obtain state information from the group. Pa-padopoulos [77] proposes embedding retransmission service into network routers known as subcast. Routers are configured to accept retransmission requests and replies from end-systems, and forward them onto links which lead to receivers missing the data. Cisco <ref> [94] </ref> has developed a similar scheme to Papadopoulos, except end-systems send NACKs directly to the source (as opposed to a router). PGM enabled routers intercept NACKs, and subcast an ACK to suppress redundant NACKs.

Reference-contexts: For an application that requires reliable multicast, but no multiple source ordering services, more efficient and lightweight protocols are sufficient. The Xpress Transport Protocol (XTPv4) <ref> [4, 95] </ref> provides multicast service primitives that offer reliable and unreliable service for both single and multiple source groups. A central agent, called the multicast group manager (MGM), maintains a list of group members and traffic specifications used by the error, flow, and congestion control algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The protocol partitions the receiver set into subgroups based on throughput and delay characteristics from the source. Thus, members with high throughput will be grouped together and will receive the data in much less time than the slow subgroups. Ammar also proposes the single connection emulation protocol (SCE) <ref> [96] </ref> which lies between IP and TCP. The SCE layer handles group management and aggregates SCE acknowledgments into a single TCP ACK. If all acknowledgments are not received by the SCE protocol, TCP will time out and send a retransmission.

Reference-contexts: The token circulates around the group and (1) allows a group member to send data, (2) informs group members of messages sent in the system, and (3) provides a total message ordering. There are a number of variants of the CM approach <ref> [10, 18, 44, 53, 67, 101] </ref> designed for specific applications and network environments. Ease of implementation and simplicity are the key advantages of centralized approaches. The drawback to centralized schemes is that network and processing overhead grows proportionally to the group size. <p> The site holding the token multicasts a sequenced acknowledgment for each message sent to the group, thereby creating a total order. Token rotation is reliable; thus, failed members can be detected. There are many extensions and variations of the CM approach. Whetten <ref> [101] </ref> presents the Reliable Multicast Protocol (RMP) which allows multiple groups, multiple ordering constraints (i.e., source ordering and/or total ordering,) and multiple reliability guarantees (i.e., reliable, unreliable or K reliable).

Reference-contexts: Moreover, reliance on this mechanism in any transport solution will be problematic, e.g., heavily switch-based networks where IP routers are sparse. Hopcount-based scoping also has severe limitations as a mechanism for grouping receivers or limiting transmissions to subsets of the global multicast group <ref> [102] </ref>. Moreover, the performance of the mechanism varies dramatically and unpredictably for receivers in different areas of the network, even for receivers within the same extended LAN. Our network model does assume the notion of domain-based scoping, as supported by IPv6 multicast addresses.

Reference-contexts: Eventually, links close to the source become saturated, thereby limiting data throughput. The scalability limitations have motivated researchers to consider protocols that distributed protocol processing among group members. One common approach is to hierarchically organize the multicast group into a tree-based structure <ref> [47, 62, 103] </ref>, thereby localizing error control and aggregating feedback. The performance of the tree-based approaches hinges on the ability to construct control trees that follow the underlying routing tree. Constructing such trees at the transport layer remains an open problem. <p> If the source does not have data to send after the heartbeat has expired, then it sends a heartbeat message with a larger heartbeat interval. LBRM is a strict transport layer solution. The difficulty is that logging servers must be strategically placed in the network. Yavatkar <ref> [103] </ref> presents the tree-based multicast transport protocol (TMTP) for single-source data distribution. TMTP is a distributed protocol based on subgrouping and DRs, thus it is very similar to RMTP. Like RMTP, each DR periodically sends positive acknowledgments to its parent in the subtree for flow control. <p> However, the CM protocol and its derivatives are based on a centralized design which does not scale to large groups [84]. Holbrook [47], Paul [62] and Yavatkar <ref> [103] </ref> use a distributed protocol design for achieving single source, reliable data distribution. These protocols strategically distribute special nodes called designated receivers (DRs) throughout the multicast group. By hierarchically organizing DRs and endsystems, errors can be recovered locally between DRs and their children. <p> During the multicast data transfer, each AR dynamically discovers neighboring ARs with which it may perform retransmissions. Discovery takes place through an advertisement protocol run at each AR, thus avoiding the overhead of setting up and maintaining static control hierarchies, e.g. as in <ref> [103] </ref>. For non-local losses, an AR runs the retransmission protocol and unicasts a retransmission request to a remote AR. If an AR receives a retransmission request and has a copy of the data, it immediately unicasts the data to the requesting AR. <p> While these performance and cost advantages come at the expense of protocol complexity within endsystems, MESH-M inherently requires less coordination overhead than schemes that set up and maintain per-source control trees, e.g., <ref> [47, 62, 103] </ref>. Furthermore, as compared with these other schemes, MESH-M is more robust to active receiver failures, adapts more readily to network congestion, and is well-suited for multiple sources.
