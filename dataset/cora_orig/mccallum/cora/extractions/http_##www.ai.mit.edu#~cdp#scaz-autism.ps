Title: Mechanisms of Shared Attention for a Humanoid Robot  
Author: Brian Scassellati

Abstract: This paper outlines a proposal for constructing mechanisms of shared attention for a humanoid robot through a series of example tasks. Shared attention, the ability to selectively attend to objects that are mutually interesting, is vital for learning from another individual. The platform that we will use in designing this system is the upper-torso humanoid robot called Cog which is currently under construction at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab. We present a description of our approach, an outline of the work in progress, and a summary of the work completed so far.

Reference-contexts: The physical system that we will use for this project is an upper-torso humanoid robot called Cog, currently under construction at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Cog was designed to explore a wide variety of problems in artificial intelligence and cognitive science <ref> (Brooks & Stein 1994) </ref>. To date our hardware systems include a ten degree-of-freedom upper-torso robot, two multiprocessor MIMD computers, a binocular, foveated video capture/display system, a six degree-of-freedom series-elastic actuated arm, and a host of programming language and support tools (Brooks 1996; Brooks et al. 1996).

Reference-contexts: Because shared attention begins developing in the first year, it is difficult to distinguish between failures that are a result of lack of motor control, failures due to lack of underlying cognitive abilities, and failures of executive or inhibitory control <ref> (Diamond 1990) </ref>. However, it does seem clear that not all parts of the mechanisms of shared attention are innate. The social cues of gesture and posture differ slightly between cultures, so some post-natal learning is necessary.

Reference-contexts: Blind children who are asked to show an object to an adult will hold out that object for inspection; if they are asked to hide an object, they will properly place the object out of the line of sight of the observer <ref> (Frith 1990) </ref>. Perhaps the most interesting case for shared attention mechanisms comes from the study of autism. Autistic children seem to lack some of the mechanisms of shared attention. For example, although autistics have no difficulty in detecting eye direction, they fail to show normal forms of gaze following.

Reference-contexts: The social cues of gesture and posture differ slightly between cultures, so some post-natal learning is necessary. Normal children do not begin to show some of the aspects of shared attention until the second or third year of life <ref> (Hobson 1993) </ref>. Children younger than nine months do not show reliable gaze monitoring.

Conclusion In this brief presentation, I have outlined a proposal for constructing mechanisms of shared attention for a humanoid robot. These mechanisms will be a vital aspect of enabling our robot to learn from an instructor using simple, natural social cues.

Reference-contexts: The evolutionary advantages of shared attention to a social creature are enormous; shared attention allows the individual to cooperate with others, signal the locations of food or danger, or to predict the behavior of others. Other primates show varying degrees of sophistication in their mechanisms of shared attention <ref> (Povinelli & Preuss 1995) </ref>. All primates recognize and exhibit proto-declarative pointing. Only chimpanzees and the great-apes will exhibit gaze following, that is, they will shift their posture and gaze to follow the line of sight of another. However, chimps fail to recognize the implications that seeing is knowing.
