Abstract: In this paper, we present a new application for n oblivious transfer, which is an interactive protocol between two parties Alice and Bob, where Alice has n secrets and Bob has a query i. At the end of the protocol Bob has the ith secret and no other information about Alice's other secrets, while Alice does not get any information about i. This new application is the Secure Database Access problem. Motivated by this application, we propose an OT scheme which achieves low communication complexity and information theoretic security. We use a distributed model for n oblivious transfer, where Bob interacts with multiple "Alices". In this model, we base our scheme on any PIR scheme, which is a scheme where only the privacy of Bob is considered, and use it to construct an OT scheme, private for both parties, without paying too much in communication complexity. This results in the first sublinear information theoretic scheme for n Further motivated by the application of n OT for polynomial n, we raise the issue of repetition 1 OT, where both security and efficiency are important. We show that previous protocols for in

Reference-contexts: In contrast, our goals are to achieves information theoretic results and a communication complexity which is sublinear in n.

However, those schemes are only concerned with Bob's privacy, and not Alice's. That is, Bob can get more information about the secrets, in addition to just S i . Thus, in order to achieve privacy for both parties, we must prevent Bob from getting this extra information. <p> Proof: These results follow directly from combining the previous corollary with the known protocols of [11] for 2 databases, <ref> [2] </ref> for any constant number k of databases, [11] for log n + 1 databases, and the [10] computational protocol for 2 databases. 2 5 Generalizations The random pointer scheme can be generalized to support more general variants of OT, such as privacy with respect to coalitions of secret holders, or
