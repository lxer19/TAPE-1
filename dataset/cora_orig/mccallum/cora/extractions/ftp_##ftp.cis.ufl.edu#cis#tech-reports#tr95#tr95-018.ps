Abstract: Decision making is an active area of research in simulation, systems engineering and artificial intelligence. One subset area of decision making, automated route planning, is covered in our paper with our approach being based on the technique of simulation rather than on purely heuristic or geometric techniques. This new technique is called simulation-based planning. Simulation-based planning is useful for route planning under various conditions including uncertain locations and events with potential adversarial activity. We claim that it is only by using simulation that one can make the most effective plan in uncertain and complex environments. An experimental design is outlined along with our plans for further development.

Reference-contexts: Difficulties arise when execution becomes part of the planning system. 2.2 Intelligent Control Intelligent control deals with problems that are more physical and less conceptual. The problem of steering a cargo ship to a desired heading <ref> (Antsaklis and Passino 1993) </ref> is a typical problem in intelligent control. <p> This can be compared to a common technique used in adaptive control theory where a reference model is compared with the actual performance data in order to tune the controller to a desired state <ref> (Antsaklis and Passino 1993) </ref>. 4 EXAMPLE PROBLEM: ROVER ROUTE PLANNING Our focus is near-optimal route planning. Route planning is in-between the higher level of symbolic AI planning and the lower level of intelligent control. There are several application areas that are related to route planning.

Reference-contexts: Robot route (i.e. path) planning is another application area. If there is little uncertainty involved, as is sometimes the case in many robot route planning problems, the existing approaches such as potential fields <ref> (Barraquand, Langlois, and Latombe 1992) </ref> do quite well. But, when uncertainties exist in the environment, these methods alone cannot produce good results. The main algorithm of producing a graph of traversable paths and searching the graph for a best route is still the same, however.

Reference-contexts: Given the current "state of the world," one can embark upon several courses of action (decisions) each of which will yield a payoff or utility (Luce and Raiffa 1957). Games can be naturally extended to continuous systems <ref> (Basar 1995) </ref>(often found in simulation) by equating the input (or forcing) function to a continuously changing decision which alters the payoff given the corresponding state changes. 3 SIMULATION-BASED PLANNING In the simulation literature, simulation is defined as "the discipline of designing a model of an actual or theoretical physical system, executing

Reference-contexts: In the planning literature, planning is defined as using models to formulate sequences of actions and given a sequence of actions, models are used to simulate the future as it would occur if the actions were carried out <ref> (Dean and Wellman 1991) </ref>. So simulation provides the robot with information which can be used to suggest modifications or to compare the proposed sequence with an alternative sequence. Humans, who plan using a similar overall approach, have models built and stored in their brains for most objects or systems.

Reference-contexts: The dotted lines in the figure represent routes that will be eliminated via the reduced visibility graph method. The visibility graph is a common approach used to create paths between obstacles <ref> (Latombe 1991) </ref> by connecting vertices of each obstacle to every other obstacle, including the start and goal location. The reduced visibility graph is a graph having the minimal Euclidean route length between the start and goal location and the obstacles. This is what appears in Figure 3.

Reference-contexts: different in different situations, we evaluate them individually and then select a plan according to a predetermined criterion. 5 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN In simulation, experimental design is a method of choosing which configurations (parameter values) to simulate so that the desired information can be acquired with the least amount of simulating <ref> (Law and Kelton 1991) </ref>. In experimental design terminology, the input parameters and structural assumptions composing a model are called factors and the output performance measures are called responses.

Reference-contexts: Our previous work in military mission planning with Computer Generated Forces shows preliminary results of our SBP approach <ref> (Lee and Fishwick 1994) </ref>. The related background research areas to planning are discussed in Section 2. In Section 3, we discuss SBP as a general methodology. Our example problem|the rover route planning problem|is presented in Section 4 and experimental design issues are discussed in Section 5. <p> Routes can greatly affect the success of the whole mission, whether the mission takes place on ground or in the air. Some of our previous research was focused on this aspect; we used simulation-based planning to perform mission planning at the company level of command <ref> (Lee and Fishwick 1994) </ref>. Using simulation-based planning in the military domain was a natural extension of the already existing wargame approach where the mission plans were tested offline via constructive simulations. Related work by (Czigler, Downes-Martin, and Panagos 1994) demonstrates the usefulness of simulation as a decision tool. <p> This approach is similar to the approach we have taken in our previous work in mission planning <ref> (Lee and Fish-wick 1994) </ref>. To reduce the amount of computation, we use the A* search method if we can build a heuristic function which can estimate the cost of the remaining route. Another possibility is the branch and bound method used in the area of Operations Research.

Reference-contexts: The part that is different is how we measure the goodness of a route. If the goal is to select a route that is the shortest in distance, we can use any of the standard algorithms of Jet Propulsion Laboratory <ref> (Matthies, Gat, Harri-son, Wilcox, R., and Litwin 1995) </ref> that exist for finding shortest paths in a graph. But, if the problem is in an environment that is unknown or uncertain, we must use different ways to evaluate each path. <p> In 1996, NASA plans to launch a spacecraft to Mars to explore the environment of the planet <ref> (Matthies, Gat, Harrison, Wilcox, R., and Litwin 1995) </ref>. The spacecraft will carry an 11 kg rover, called the Mi-crorover, that will move around the vicinity of the landing site to explore the territory for a duration of approximately 1 to 4 weeks. <p> In the arena, they have created Mars analog terrains by randomly distributing rocks according to an exponential model of Mars rock size and frequency created from Viking lander imagery. adopted from <ref> (Matthies, Gat, Harrison, Wilcox, R., and Litwin 1995) </ref>. The term nominal is explained in more detail in Section 5. JPL has decomposed the rover navigation task into four functions: 1) goal designation; 2) rover localization; 3) hazard detection; and 4) path selection. <p> Continued partial support of this work will be possible through contract #4514169-12 from Rome Laboratory, Griffiss Air Force Base, New York. We would also like to thank the JPL Mars Microrover group for their permission to use Figure 1 and various data appearing in <ref> (Matthies, Gat, Harrison, Wilcox, R., and Litwin 1995) </ref>. Disclaimer: this work is not funded by JPL. The authors have used Figure 1 and other rover related data as a sample application of the simulation-based planning procedure.

Reference-contexts: However, optimization techniques such as response surfaces and metamodels can be used to alleviate the problem. Currently, JPL is experimenting their Microrover by performing test runs on Mars analog terrains which has been created artificially by randomly placing rocks according to a rock size-frequency model developed by Moore <ref> (Moore and Jakosky 1989) </ref>. Moore's model is based on data obtained from images taken by Viking Lander 2. Since a similar rock density is expected for the Microrover experiment, the same model can be used.

Reference-contexts: gain better insight into the nature of our problem, we will overview different areas that are relevant to planning. 2.1 Artificial Intelligence The general problem of planning in AI is commonly identified with problems that are highly conceptual where actions are of the form "Go To Supermarket" and "Buy milk" <ref> (Russell and Norvig 1995) </ref>. A plan is an ordered set of these high-level actions. Here, the concern is not how one will physically (at a detailed level) get to a supermarket, but rather on the ordered set of actions whose logical effects will satisfy the goal.
