Reference-contexts: These coordinates become arguments to a procedural or tabular solid texture [Perlin85], [Peachey85], and result in objects appearing carved from a solid, rather than covered by a pattern. Two-dimensional textures can also be projected onto surfaces as decals <ref> [Bier-Sloan86] </ref>. 2.3.4 Scanning Textures and Image Warps To render a texture mapped surface we must compose the parameterization and projection mappings. As shown in the mapping composition table earlier, some combinations of parameterization and projection compose elegantly; others do not.

Reference-contexts: We begin by reviewing the goals and applications of texture mapping and image warping. 1.1 Texture Mapping Texture mapping is a shading technique for image synthesis in which a texture image is mapped onto a surface in a three dimensional scene, much as wallpaper is applied to a wall [Catmull74], <ref> [Blinn-Newell76] </ref>, [Heckbert86b]. If we were modeling a table, for example, we might use a rectangular box for the table top, and four cylinders for the legs. Unadorned, this table model would look quite dull when rendered. <p> Signal processing theory has been applied by computer graphicists to problems of edge antialiasing [Crow77] with good results. Existing theory is lacking for problems of resampling non-affine mappings, however [Smith83], so most of the filters developed for texture mapping [Catmull74], <ref> [Blinn-Newell76] </ref>, [Feibush-Levoy-Cook80], [Williams83], [Crow84], [Heckbert86b] have been based on filter design heuristics and subjective quality comparisons. First we will review the causes of aliasing during resampling. We then develop a theory of ideal resampling filters that eliminate aliasing during resampling.

Reference-contexts: The b-spline filters are FIR approximations to the Gaussian. By the Central Limit Theorem of probability <ref> [Bracewell78] </ref>, as n increases, b n broadens and approaches a Gaussian (normal distribution) in shape. The standard deviation of these functions grows as the square root of n: b n (x) g 2 (x) where = p n=12. An FIR approximation to the Gaussian can also be made by windowing.

Reference-contexts: Similar artifacts occur in image warping applications. Such artifacts are intolerable in realistic still images or animation, so we will endeavor to eradicate them. Aliasing has been studied extensively in the field of digital signal processing.

Most of the theoretical research on resampling to date has been driven by audio applications, and is consequently limited to 1-D uniform resampling (i.e. affine mappings) [Crochiere-Rabiner83]. <p> This behavior suggests that reconstruction accuracy is a function of frequency. Aliasing is best understood in terms of a frequency analysis of signals and filters using the Fourier transform <ref> [Brigham74] </ref>. 32 3.2.1 Frequency Analysis of Aliasing The units of frequency can be either angular frequency in radians per unit distance, denoted !, or rotational frequency in cycles per unit distance, denoted f . The two are related by ! = 2f . We will use angular frequency !.

Reference-contexts: These applications are surveyed, and their original literature is cited, in <ref> [Carey-Greenberg85] </ref>. In all of the varieties of texture mapping mentioned above, geometric mappings are fundamental. Two-dimensional mappings are used to define the parameterization of a surface and to describe the transformation between the texture coordinate system and the screen coordinate system.

Texture mapping does not affect hidden surface elimination, but merely adds a small incremental cost to the shading process. The technique generalizes easily to curved surfaces <ref> [Catmull74] </ref>. Texture mapping can be used to define many surface parameters besides color. <p> Signal processing theory has been applied by computer graphicists to problems of edge antialiasing [Crow77] with good results.

Reference-contexts: To compensate for this nonlinearity we must perform gamma correction. The most popular correction method uses pixel values proportional to intensity and a hardware colormap containing the function (monitor input) = C (pixel value) 1=fl <ref> [Catmull79] </ref>. Without gamma correction, efforts toward antialiasing are hampered. 3.5.3 Filter Shape A general 2-D filter has an impulse response (or point spread function) of two variables h (x; y).

Reference-contexts: The coefficients of a bilinear or projective patch can be inferred from a four point correspondence between texture space and object space. Bilinear patches are sometimes used in texture mapping [Hourcade-Nicolas83], <ref> [Catmull-Smith80] </ref> when nonplanar quadrilaterals are needed. Projective patches are usually preferable for planar quadrilaterals, however, because of their superior properties. Occasionally, practitioners have used bilinear patches when projective patches would have been more appropriate. For example, bilinear parameterizations were proposed for point-in-quadrilateral testing in a ray tracing machine [Ullner83]. <p> Multi-pass methods decompose a 2-D mapping into two or more 1-D mappings. In the two-pass form, the first pass processes the rows of an image and the second pass processes the columns. Multi-pass methods have been used for both texture mapping <ref> [Catmull-Smith80] </ref>, [Smith87] and for image processing [Wolberg88], to perform geometric correction of images [Fraser-Schowengerdt-Briggs85] or affine image warps [Paeth86]. These methods work particularly well for affine and projective mappings, where the 1-D resampling warps for each pass are affine and projective (rational linear), respectively. <p> These methods work particularly well for affine and projective mappings, where the 1-D resampling warps for each pass are affine and projective (rational linear), respectively. Bilinear mappings are possible as well, but they require rational quadratic resampling warps <ref> [Catmull-Smith80] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Reconstruct the continuous signal from the discrete input signal. 2. Warp the domain of the continuous signal. 3. Prefilter the warped, continuous signal. 4. Sample this signal to produce the discrete output signal. A closely related procedure is described by <ref> [Clark-Palmer-Lawrence85] </ref>. The problem they address is the reconstruction of a continuous signal from a discrete signal sampled with nonuniform spacing, whereas our problem, resampling, involves the creation of a uniformly sampled discrete output signal from a uniformly sampled discrete input.

Reference-contexts: We will discuss three classes of mappings: affine, bilinear, and projective. Homogeneous Notation The homogeneous representation for points provides a consistent notation for affine and projective mappings. Homogeneous notation was used in projective geometry [Maxwell46], <ref> [Coxeter78] </ref> long before its introduction to computer graphics [Roberts66]. The homogeneous notation is often misunderstood so we will take a moment to clarify its use and properties. In familiar Euclidean geometry we represent points of the real plane R 2 by vectors of the form (x; y). <p> Projective mappings share many of the desirable properties of affine mappings. Unlike bilinear mappings, which preserve equispaced points along certain lines, the projective mappings do not in general preserve equispaced points (figure 2.7). Instead they preserve a quantity called the "cross ratio" of points <ref> [Coxeter78] </ref>. Like affine mappings, projective mappings preserve lines at all 17 a) Warped grid in destination space for quadrilateral 1. b) Warped grid in destination space for quadrilateral 2. Note the vanishing points. orientations. In fact, projective mappings are the most general line-preserving bijective mappings.

Reference-contexts: When it is known a priori that the sampling grid is nearly uniform, a fixed "interpolation" filter can be used with good results [Gonzalez-Wintz87]. Uniform resampling (often known as "sampling rate conversion") is a fairly common task for 1-D signals such as audio <ref> [Crochiere-Rabiner83] </ref>. Nonuniform sampling has received much less attention to date. 6 the screen. 7 1.3 Organization of this Thesis This thesis is split into two halves: chapter 2 contains a discussion of basic 2-D mappings, and chapter 3 develops and applies a theory for resampling filters. <p> Most of the theoretical research on resampling to date has been driven by audio applications, and is consequently limited to 1-D uniform resampling (i.e. affine mappings) <ref> [Crochiere-Rabiner83] </ref>. Signal processing theory has been applied by computer graphicists to problems of edge antialiasing [Crow77] with good results. <p> Most previous work on resampling filters has concentrated on the special case of affine warps, for which the resampling filter is space invariant. A common task in audio processing is the conversion of a discrete 1-D signal from one sampling rate to another <ref> [Crochiere-Rabiner83] </ref>. The terminology 41 of earlier researchers differs somewhat from ours: where they perform "interpolation" or "decimation" at a "uniform sampling rate" during "sampling rate conversion" for a "multirate" task, we perform "magnification" or "decimation" according to "affine mappings" during "resampling" for a "warping" task.

Most of the theoretical research on resampling to date has been driven by audio applications, and is consequently limited to 1-D uniform resampling (i.e. affine mappings) [Crochiere-Rabiner83]. <p> Therefore, an ideal low pass filter, because it has finite frequency response, is not an FIR filter. FIR filters are precisely the class of filters most common in image processing, however, because they are the easiest 2-D filters to design and implement <ref> [Dudgeon-Mersereau84] </ref>. And since FIR filters are usually implemented using convolution, the expense of which is proportional to the support, we desire filters with small support. Narrowing the support broadens the frequency response, generally decreasing the quality of the filter, however. <p> The filter profile is stored in a lookup table for speed, so it could be arbitrary. Since the EWA filter gives independent control of region and profile, it is an example of filter design by the transformation method <ref> [Dudgeon-Mersereau84] </ref>. The EWA filter is a direct convolution method, so its cost is proportional to the area of the texture region, like other high quality texture filters [Heckbert86b], but its coefficient of proportionality is lower than most.

Reference-contexts: As shown in figure 2.5, this mapping can be computed by linearly interpolating by fraction u along the top and bottom edges of the quadrilateral, and then linearly interpolating by fraction v between the two interpolated points to yield destination point (x; y) <ref> [Faux-Pratt79] </ref>: (x; y) = (1 u)(1 v)p 00 + u (1 v)p 10 + (1 u)vp 01 + uvp 11 The general form in matrix notation is: ( x y ) = ( uv u v 1 ) &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; : b f <p> For curved surfaces, parameterization ease varies 23 with modeling technique. Parameterizations are inherent when a surface is modeled parametrically <ref> [Faux-Pratt79] </ref>, but can be difficult to construct for implicit surfaces. One method for fabricating a parameterization uses the coordinates of 3-D object space as texture parameters rather than attempt to construct surface-following parameters. <p> Jacobian M: M = &gt; &gt; &gt; : u y v y &gt; &gt; &gt; ; The Jacobian is related to the implicit conic matrix by Q = M 1 M 1 T This conic matrix is closely related to the first fundamental matrix of a surface in differential geometry <ref> [Faux-Pratt79] </ref>. We wish to solve the above equation for M under the constraint that the basis is orthogonal, i.e. M 1 T M 1 is diagonal.

Reference-contexts: Close examination of figure 2.2 reveals some of the flaws in the algorithm above. Aliasing (not visible here) would result from a high frequency texture. This can be eliminated by filtering an area surrounding the texture point (u; v) rather than sampling just a single pixel <ref> [Feibush-Levoy-Cook80] </ref>, [Heckbert86b]. More fundamentally, however, these images do not exhibit the foreshortening we expect from perspective (compare with figure 2.3). The textured polygon also shows disturbing discontinuities along horizontal lines passing through each vertex. These discon-tinuities are artifacts of the linear interpolation of u and v. <p> Signal processing theory has been applied by computer graphicists to problems of edge antialiasing [Crow77] with good results. Existing theory is lacking for problems of resampling non-affine mappings, however [Smith83], so most of the filters developed for texture mapping [Catmull74], [Blinn-Newell76], <ref> [Feibush-Levoy-Cook80] </ref>, [Williams83], [Crow84], [Heckbert86b] have been based on filter design heuristics and subjective quality comparisons.

Reference-contexts: One form of predictability present in the simplest mappings is the preservation of straight lines. If a texture mapping or image warp bends lines then the results are less predictable than those of a line-preserving mapping. Other desirable properties are the preservation of equispaced points, angles <ref> [Fiume-Fournier-Canale87] </ref>, and areas. The implementer of such a system seeks efficient, incremental computations and well-behaved functions (single-valued and invertible). We will see how well the simplest 2-D mappings meet these criteria. 11 linear interpolation of u; v.

Reference-contexts: Image warping is used in image processing primarily for the correction of geometric distortions introduced by imperfect imaging systems <ref> [Gonzalez-Wintz87] </ref>. Camera lenses sometimes introduce pincushion or barrel distortions, perspective views introduce a projective distortion, and other nonlinear optical components can create more complex distortions. In image processing, we do image warping typically to remove the distortions from an image, while in computer graphics we are usually introducing one. <p> When it is known a priori that the sampling grid is nearly uniform, a fixed "interpolation" filter can be used with good results <ref> [Gonzalez-Wintz87] </ref>.

We assume the texture is being resampled by screen order scanning. At each screen pixel we compute the Jacobian of the mapping. We think of this Jacobian as two basis vectors in texture space, with their origin at the preimage of the screen pixel's center.

Most of the theoretical research on resampling to date has been driven by audio applications, and is consequently limited to 1-D uniform resampling (i.e. affine mappings) [Crochiere-Rabiner83]. <p> This is an uncertainty principle for signals: a signal cannot be narrow both spatially and spectrally <ref> [Hamming83] </ref>.

Windowing with a box amounts to truncation of the impulse response; this is one of the poorest window functions. We will need to window if we choose an IIR filter such as a Gaussian or sinc. <p> The theory can hopefully help us design even higher quality, more efficient filters in the future. We have pursued the elliptical Gaussian here because its closure properties make it an elegant resampling filter. There are, however, a number of 1-D filters of higher quality than the Gaussian <ref> [Hamming83] </ref>, [Turkowski88]. We would like to find less drastic measures than eccentricity clamping to bound the expense of future resampling filters.

Reference-contexts: begin by reviewing the goals and applications of texture mapping and image warping. 1.1 Texture Mapping Texture mapping is a shading technique for image synthesis in which a texture image is mapped onto a surface in a three dimensional scene, much as wallpaper is applied to a wall [Catmull74], [Blinn-Newell76], <ref> [Heckbert86b] </ref>. If we were modeling a table, for example, we might use a rectangular box for the table top, and four cylinders for the legs. Unadorned, this table model would look quite dull when rendered. <p> Close examination of figure 2.2 reveals some of the flaws in the algorithm above. Aliasing (not visible here) would result from a high frequency texture. This can be eliminated by filtering an area surrounding the texture point (u; v) rather than sampling just a single pixel [Feibush-Levoy-Cook80], <ref> [Heckbert86b] </ref>. More fundamentally, however, these images do not exhibit the foreshortening we expect from perspective (compare with figure 2.3). The textured polygon also shows disturbing discontinuities along horizontal lines passing through each vertex. These discon-tinuities are artifacts of the linear interpolation of u and v. <p> Signal processing theory has been applied by computer graphicists to problems of edge antialiasing [Crow77] with good results. Existing theory is lacking for problems of resampling non-affine mappings, however [Smith83], so most of the filters developed for texture mapping [Catmull74], [Blinn-Newell76], [Feibush-Levoy-Cook80], [Williams83], [Crow84], <ref> [Heckbert86b] </ref> have been based on filter design heuristics and subjective quality comparisons. First we will review the causes of aliasing during resampling. We then develop a theory of ideal resampling filters that eliminate aliasing during resampling. <p> Since the EWA filter gives independent control of region and profile, it is an example of filter design by the transformation method [Dudgeon-Mersereau84]. The EWA filter is a direct convolution method, so its cost is proportional to the area of the texture region, like other high quality texture filters <ref> [Heckbert86b] </ref>, but its coefficient of proportionality is lower than most. <p> In such cases it is of great benefit to use EWA on an image pyramid <ref> [Heckbert86b] </ref>. <p> Angled pyramids are indexed by the five parameters of an ellipse: x, y, major radius a, minor radius b, and angle (figure B.1). Experimentation with nonstandard pyramids is an area of active research <ref> [Heckbert86b] </ref>; it is not yet known if their time benefits relative to standard pyramids compensate for their increased storage costs. Even if we restrict ourselves to standard pyramids, other optimizations are possible for speeding the filtering of eccentric ellipses.

Projective patches are usually preferable for planar quadrilaterals, however, because of their superior properties. Occasionally, practitioners have used bilinear patches when projective patches would have been more appropriate. For example, bilinear parameterizations were proposed for point-in-quadrilateral testing in a ray tracing machine [Ullner83].

As stated earlier, the ideal low pass filter is a box in frequency space, but such a filter is not realizable as an FIR filter, so the ideal is padded with tolerances to make it realizable.

Texture order is preferable only when the texture-to-screen mapping is difficult to invert, or when the texture image must be read sequentially and will not fit in random access memory.
