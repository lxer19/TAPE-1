Abstract: A router-based packet-filtering firewall is an effective way of protecting an enterprise network from unauthorized accesses. However, it will not work efficiently in an ATM network because it requires the termination of end-to-end ATM connections at a packet-filtering router, which incurs huge overhead of reassembling and dissembling packets. Few approaches to this problem have been proposed in the literature; however, none of these approaches is completely satisfactory. In this paper, we present the hardware design of a high-speed ATM firewall that does not require the termination of an end-to-end connection in the middle. Compared with the traditional firewalls, this ATM firewall performs exactly the same packet-level filtering without compromising the performance and has the same "look and feel" by sitting at the chokepoint between the private and public ATM networks. It is also easy to manage and flexible to use.

Reference-contexts: This means that no delay is incurred even when a cache miss occurs. A recent survey on the packet size in a WAN shows that the average packet size is around 257 [12], which will occupy 6 cells if AAL5 is used <ref> [1] </ref>. If we assume that cells of different packets interleave with each other, on an OC-3c line, a connection of 25 Mbps, the average lapse between arrival times of the first cell and the last cell of a packet will be 36 cell time, enough for the inspection to finish. <p> The first and second cells are identified through the Exp-1st and Exp-2nd bits in the VP/VC table respectively. When 14 the last cell of a packet is encountered ("Last cell?") , which is identified through the PTI field <ref> [1] </ref> in the cell header, Exp-1st is turned on ("Exp-1st:=TRUE"). When the first cell of a packet is encountered, Exp-2nd is turned on. ("Exp-2nd:=TRUE"). In the first two cells of a packet, the T-MONITOR bits are turned on.

Reference-contexts: ATM Forum favors the avoidance of packet filtering by exerting discretions at the connection establishment time. Based on this principle, two alternative access-control schemes have been proposed. Smith <ref> [2] </ref> proposes that access control decisions be made at connection set up time based on the higher layer information (e.g., source and destination IP addresses, ports, etc.) contained in the information elements (IEs) of the signaling message.

Reference-contexts: Obviously, this is unacceptable because an intruder can always lie about the service it wants to access at the connection establishment time, and there is no way to check the content of a connection once the connection is established. Pierson <ref> [3] </ref> tries to fix this problem by proposing that "a new SVC is requested when each new service is started". However, this requires the ATM layer be notified whenever a new socket is opened, which entails considerable change to the whole TCP/IP stack and existing applications [6].

Reference-contexts: For a detailed description of the design of an ATM switch, <ref> [4] </ref> can be consulted. A conceptual structure of a typical ATM switch is depicted in Fig. 3. An ATM switch consists of five functional modules, namely, input module (IM), output module (OM), cell switching fabric (CSF), call admission control (CAC), and system management (SM). <p> Call screening process can be done in parallel with normal call admission control process and will not introduce any extra delay. 4.5 System Management (SM) SM handles all the management plane functions in a switch including fault management, performance management, configuration management, accounting management, security management, and traffic management <ref> [4] </ref>. In a firewall switch, we need to add a management function, called firewall management, to manage the security functions that need to be performed by the switch.

Reference-contexts: As traditional firewalls can no longer perform the packet level filtering in an ATM network, a new ATM firewall architecture is called for. 1.2 Existing Approaches At the time of writing, only one design of packet filtering ATM firewall is available, which is StorageTek's ATLAS product <ref> [5] </ref>. ATLAS is a line filter that scans an ATM physical link to perform the packet-level filtering at the rate OC-3c (155 Mbps). We are told by StorateTek that 1 next-generation ATLAS is going to support the filtering rate of OC-12c in the near future.

Reference-contexts: Pierson [3] tries to fix this problem by proposing that "a new SVC is requested when each new service is started". However, this requires the ATM layer be notified whenever a new socket is opened, which entails considerable change to the whole TCP/IP stack and existing applications <ref> [6] </ref>. Even worse, this requires a new SVC for each transport layer flow, which leads to the problem of VC explosion. Therefore, replacing the packet level filtering with call screening will not solve the problem of access control in an ATM network.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, replacing the packet level filtering with call screening will not solve the problem of access control in an ATM network. Arguably, another alternative is to apply cryptographic measures end-to-end so that packet filtering in the middle can be avoided <ref> [7] </ref>. A centralized encrypting gateway, called encrypting ATM firewall in the literature, is employed between a protected ATM Network and untrusted WAN to perform encryption operation on behalf of all protected hosts [13]. However, authentication and encrypting do not automatically ensure proper access control.

Reference-contexts: All these operations are implemented using simple combinatorial logic (see Appendix A) and can be performed within less than a cell time. TCP/IP Express Check (TEC) block employs StorageTek's policy cache scheme <ref> [8] </ref>. When the first cell of a packet arrives at the TEC, it is checked against the policy cache for a match. If a match is found, the decision (forward or drop) is forwarded to EHT.

Reference-contexts: First, it does not accept IP packets with options because IP option fields can be as large as 40 bytes and may "push" the TCP header to the second cell. It may become a severe limitation in the future internetworking environments where certain options like AH <ref> [14] </ref> are used frequently. Second, it is not friendly to those who have to manage and administer it. Whenever a new PVC or SVC is established, TCP/IP rules for that VC will have to be manually configured. <p> Also, due to its "after-the-fact" nature, there is no technical difficulty in employing many such servers to perform traffic monitoring service in parallel. 2.2.5 Proxy Service Proxy service serves as the proxy server for a number of Interent protocols as well as IP security protocols such as <ref> [11, 14, 9, 10] </ref>.

We can arrange that the first several packets used to exchange security association information go through the proxy service.

Reference-contexts: As we have explained above, external hosts are not able to spoof an internal address. Therefore, no SNMP and NFS attack can be launched from outside the firewall. ICMP is shown to be pretty safe <ref> [15] </ref> though exploitation of its security weakness can lead to the denial of service.

Reference-contexts: However, as we have explained, traffic monitoring service effectively detect and block such type of attack. * NFS, SNMP, and DNS are three UDP-based protocols that have security holes <ref> [16] </ref>. With DNS, since we only have one DNS server in the internal network, we can always make it secure by only exchange information with authenticated DNS servers outside. With SNMP and NFS, we only run it inside a private network (with VPN, we can use encrypting gateway). <p> A proxy server for a protocol acts as the middleman between the client processes and the server processes of the protocol <ref> [16, 17] </ref>. It interprets every step 7 of the client-server interaction and block any unsafe steps. For example, an proxy server for FTP protocol can be configured to allow "get" and "mget", while disallow "put" and "mput" from inside to outside (lets file in but not out). <p> Unlike packet filtering service, which only looks at the header of the packet, proxy service monitors the execution of the protocol and filters at the application level <ref> [16, 17] </ref>. However, since proxy service may need to look into the content of packets to understand the protocol; reassembling and disassembling of packets are required for this service. Therefore it can only be performed at the rate of a traditional firewall.

Reference-contexts: Besides, the service will tear down the connection to prevent the foreign host from making further attacks. However, there is still one loophole to be addressed, which is the sequence number prediction attack <ref> [18] </ref>. By predicting the sequence number of the SYN+ACK packet sent from the internal host, the foreign host can forge final ACK packet along with the first SYN packet without receiving the SYN+ACK packet from the internal host.
