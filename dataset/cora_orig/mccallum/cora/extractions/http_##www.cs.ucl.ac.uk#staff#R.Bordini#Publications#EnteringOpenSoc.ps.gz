Title: On Entering an Open Society

Abstract: This paper concerns the problem of agent migration between open societies. In particular, it focuses on the problems of an agent entering an open society. Two functional levels in open societies are recognized, the language and interaction level, and the knowledge and performance level. It is argued that a functional approach to those levels, permitting that social roles and social processes be defined in each of them, can be handy in the uniform treatment of the various problems involved in entering a society. In particular, it is argued that the functional approach allows the reduction of most of such problems to the problems of recognizing, learning and negotiating roles and protocols in social structures, which are problems that can be treated in a general form, from the point of view of that approach. Some mechanisms for roles identification are proposed and discussed.

Reference-contexts: Entering and leaving a society When an agent enters a society, a few problems are posed for both the agent and the society, which must be solved before the agent and the society can benefit from each other. In <ref> [BER 92] </ref> some of those problems were analysed, and solutions were proposed.

Open societies and agent migration Open societies are societies that agents can enter or leave freely. Also, they are societies where agents can move freely from one site to another. We call such movements agent migrations. <p> They have served for the ellaboration of the role recognition mechanisms. Explicit role presentation and role recognition have found somewhat direct realizations. Role induction is currently being examined.

Reference-contexts: We suggest that the two kinds of problems be seen as refering to two functional levels in open societies, so that they can be put under the general functional framework studied elsewhere [COS 93a] [COS 93b] <ref> [COS 94] </ref> and described briefly here.

A transition-graph corresponding to such protocol is shown in Fig. 6. <p> Conclusion We have touched in this paper, some problems concerning agent migration between open societies. Theoretical aspects of open societies and agent migration, which are currently under investigated [COS 93a] <ref> [COS 94] </ref> have been summarized in the first part of the paper. The idea of two functional levels in an open society, the language and interaction level, and the knowledge and performance level, was introduced. They are assumed to be functional structures in the sense of [COS 94]. <p> under investigated [COS 93a] <ref> [COS 94] </ref> have been summarized in the first part of the paper.

It was proposed that some problems concerning their specific ways of functioning could be solved by applying solutions found for corresponding problems in the general structure. The problem of role recognition is one of such problems.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction This paper deals with some aspects of distributed AI systems <ref> [DEM 90] </ref>. In particular, it deals with open multi-agent systems, here called open societies. The problem of agent migration between open societies is considered in its most critical aspect, namely, the entrance of an agent in a new society. <p> In this respect, it is remarkable how usual it is to assume, in distributed AI, that not all agents know everything or that not all agents are capable of performing the same way in a society, concerning the problems that a society must solve <ref> [DEM 90] </ref>, while it is also usual to assume that all agents are capable of the same language uses and interaction processes.

Reference-contexts: An agent may send a message only if it is in the state indicated in the corresponding transition of the protocol. The notation we use was also influenced by the CSP notation <ref> [HOA 85] </ref>. State-transitions not performed by actions not under the control of the protocol (such as the effective production and consumption actions, in the examples below) do not originate transtions in the protocol, but their effects (expressed as state transformations) are reflected in the states indicated in the protocol. <p> They are called t r a c e specifications. The notation used is simple enough to presented through example. It is essentially the CPS notation <ref> [HOA 85] </ref> (fig. 8 presents trace specifications for the roles Consumer and Producer). The procedure used by the observer to recognize a role, is simple. The observer follows step by step the behavior of the observed agent. <p> The notation for the trace specifications can also be seen as a language where actions sequences are combined, and even a calculus of trace specifications can be elaborated, on the basis of <ref> [HOA 85] </ref>, where equivalence of induced roles can be determined. To illustrate the approach, consider the action sequence of sending messages that can be represented by: step (X,Y) = request (X) -&gt; inform (Y).

Reference-contexts: A sample open society, the Producer-Intermediary-Consumer society, already considered in a simplified version in [COS 93b], is examined from the point of view of the entrance of new agents into it. We consider the problem role recognition in such sample society, and we summarize work going on in <ref> [HB 94] </ref> dealing with this problem in that sample society. In the Conclusion we comment another work also going on concerning agent migration between open societies [BOR 94]. 2. Open societies and agent migration Open societies are societies that agents can enter or leave freely. <p> Specialized means should be available to open societies, to enable them to solve the problem of keeping their functional integrity in view of agent migrations. This is partially the subject of on going work [COS 94] <ref> [HB 94] </ref>. The main problems of a migrating agent are problems of helping the societies it is leaving or entering, to keep their functional integrity. <p> Mechanisms for role identification In this section we show some mechanisms for role identification, which are being developed in <ref> [HB 94] </ref>. <p> Secondly, there must be a formalism for the specification of roles, that the observer agent can use to produce descriptions of the observed behaviors. The formalism should also be used to represent the predefined set of roles which are know by the observer agent. In <ref> [HB 94] </ref>, the specification of a role is made through the explicit representation of all the traces of agent behaviors that the role allows. They are called t r a c e specifications. The notation used is simple enough to presented through example. <p> However, instead of comparing the observed behavior with a predefined set of trace specifications, the observer agent analyses the observed behavior looking for typical indications that the observed behavior corresponds to a social role. In the experiments made in <ref> [HB 94] </ref>, for instance, the observer agent looks for typical action sequences. The idea is that, within certain limits, behaviors corresponding to social roles in a society can be defined as organized sets of certain action sequences that are common to every (or almost every) social role in the society. <p> The Producer-Intermediary-Consumer society, already taken as object of study in [COS 93b], was taken as the sample society where to study solutions for the role recognition problem in a general functional structure. Architectural and operational problems concerning role recognition in the PIC society are under investigation <ref> [HB 94] </ref>, and have been summarized in the second part of the paper. Prototype PIC societies have been implemented on the workbench developed by Moniz [MON 93]. They have served for the ellaboration of the role recognition mechanisms. Explicit role presentation and role recognition have found somewhat direct realizations.

Reference-contexts: This allows for more complexity in the structures and processes involved in the problem, which serves as better a test for the functional approach. 6. The Producer-Intermediary-Consumer society To represent protocols we use transition systems specifications <ref> [PLO 81] </ref>. A protocol action is assumed to change the states of the interacting agents (in the PIC model, only two agents are affected by each action, actions can be specified).

Reference-contexts: From such point of view, concerns of both language and interaction, and knowledge and performance of agents, can be seen as sets of social processes and structures, where agents perform some roles, as will be explained below. In <ref> [POP 93] </ref>, agent roles were identified to agent behaviors in problem solving activities, and social processes were seen as communication protocols that agents were expected to follow when they were interacting. <p> From such point of view, both levels can be organized under the same principles - social processes and social roles - so that solutions that apply to one of them will possibly apply to the other. In particular, in <ref> [POP 93] </ref>, the problem of knowing each other better was analysed, and some solutions for it were proposed. <p> Mechanisms for role identification In this section we show some mechanisms for role identification, which are being developed in [HB 94]. We identify three main mechanisms for role identification: explicit role presentation (suggested in <ref> [POP 93] </ref>), recognition of observed roles, and induction of role descriptions. 7.1 Explicit role presentation The mechanism of explicit presentation of roles is the simplest mechanism allowing an agent to identify the role that another agent is performing in a society, in a given moment. <p> In <ref> [POP 93] </ref> it is implicitly assumed that the notion of role is an absolute one, because role is identified with behavior, and it is assumed that agents know their own behaviors, and inform about them to the other agents.
