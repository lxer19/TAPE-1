Abstract: The wide applicability of zero-knowledge interactive proofs comes from the possibility of using these proofs as subroutines in cryptographic protocols. A basic question concerning this use is whether the (sequential and/or parallel) composition of zero-knowledge protocols is zero-knowledge too. We demonstrate the limitations of the composition of zero-knowledge protocols by proving that the original denition of zero-knowledge is not closed under sequential composition; and that even the strong formulations of zero-knowledge (e.g. black-box simulation) are not closed under parallel execution. We present lower bounds on the round complexity of zero-knowledge proofs, with signicant implications to the parallelization of zero-knowledge protocols. We prove that 3-round interactive proofs and constant-round Arthur-Merlin proofs that are black-box simulation zero-knowledge exist only for languages in BPP. In particular, it follows that the "parallel versions" of the rst interactive proofs systems presented for quadratic residuosity, graph isomorphism and any language in NP, are not black-box simulation zero-knowledge, unless the corresponding languages are in BPP. Whether these parallel versions constitute zero-knowledge proofs was an intriguing open question arising from the early works on zero-knowledge. Other consequences are a proof of optimality for the round complexity of various known zero-knowledge protocols, and the necessity of using secret coins in the design of "parallelizable" constant-round zero-knowledge proofs.

Reference-contexts: We show that only BPP languages have constant-round Arthur-Merlin proofs which are also black-box simulation zero-knowledge. Arthur-Merlin interactive proofs, introduced by Babai <ref> [Bab] </ref>, are interactive proofs in which all the messages sent by the verier are the outcome of his coin tosses. In other words, the verier "keeps no secrets from the prover". <p> An interactive proof in which the honest verier chooses all its messages at random (i.e. with uniform probability over the set of all strings of same length as the message) is called an Arthur-Merlin interactive proof <ref> [Bab] </ref>. That is, in an Arthur-Merlin proof system the only non-trivial computation carried out by the honest verier is the evaluation of a polynomial-time predicate at the end of the interaction, in order to decide the acceptance or rejection of the input to the protocol.

Reference-contexts: The protocols for Quadratic Non-Residuosity [GMR1] and Graph Non-Isomorphism [GMW1] are such examples. In addition, zero-knowledge interactive proofs of 5 rounds are known for Quadratic Residuosity and Graph Isomorphism <ref> [BMO1] </ref>, and assuming the existence of claw-free permutations there exist 5-round zero-knowledge interactive proofs for any language in NP [GKa].

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Silvio Micali was one of the only to strongly object the "intuition" that the parallel versions of the interactive proof systems for Quadratic Residuosity, Graph Isomorphism, and all languages in NP, are zero-knowledge. The results in this paper are rooted in this clear vision of Silvio.

Reference-contexts: Our result is a good reason to believe that the only feasible way of constructing constant-round zero-knowledge interactive proofs is to let the verier use "secret coins". Indeed, the above mentioned constant-round zero-knowledge proofs, as well as the constant round statistical zero-knowledge proofs of <ref> [BMO2] </ref>, use secret coins. Thus, secret coins do help in the zero-knowledge setting. This should be contrasted with the result of Goldwasser and Sipser [GS] which states that Arthur-Merlin interactive proofs are equivalent to general interactive proofs (as far as language recognition is concerned). <p> On the other hand, the simulator M runs (expected) time that is bounded by a specic polynomial. So, how can this simulator manage to feed a verier requiring more coin tosses than this bound? In <ref> [BMO2] </ref> this problem is overcome by stating the existence of two random tapes for M. The rst is used in the regular way for M's computations. The second can be entirely fed by M into V * in a single step. <p> Clearly, the running time of the simulator M p may depend on the polynomial p and then the above difculty is overcome. This second formulation is weaker than the one proposed in <ref> [BMO2] </ref>, but it sufces for the results proved in our paper and therefore adopted here. (In fact our results of Section 6 only require the existence of a simulator that simulates deterministic veriers, i.e. M p with p 0).

Reference-contexts: In particular, we get that bounded round Arthur-Merlin proofs which are black-box zero-knowledge exist only for BPP, while unbounded round proofs of the same type exist for all PSPACE (if one-way functions exist <ref> [IY, B*, Sha] </ref>). That is, while the nite hierarchy of languages having black-box zero-knowledge Arthur-Merlin proofs collapses to BPP (= AM (0)), the corresponding innite hierarchy contains all of PSPACE. This implies (assuming the existence of one-way functions) a separation between the two hierarchies.

Reference-contexts: the prover has a signicant (e.g. constant) probability of cheating. 2 Interactive arguments (also known as "computationally sound proofs" and "computationally convincing protocols") differ from an interactive proof system in that the soundness condition of the system is formulated with respect to probabilistic polynomial-time provers, possibly with auxiliary input (see <ref> [BCC] </ref>). Namely, efcient provers cannot fool the verier into accepting an input not in the language, except with negligible probability. - 5 - Constant Round Arthur-Merlin Proofs When restricting ourselves to Arthur-Merlin interactive proofs, we can extend the above result to any constant number of rounds. <p> Finally, our results hold also in the setting of interactive arguments <ref> [BCC] </ref>, i.e. "interactive proofs" in which the prover is limited to probabilistic polynomial-time computations, possibly getting an auxiliary input. - 17 - 6.1 The case AM (3) The protocol &lt;P,V&gt;: Consider an Arthur-Merlin protocol &lt;P , V &gt; for a language L, consisting of three rounds.

Reference-contexts: Sequential Composition Soon after the publication of the [GMR1] paper, several researchers noticed that the formulation of zero-knowledge proposed therein (hereafter referred as the original formulation) is probably not closed under sequential composition. In particular, Feige and Shamir <ref> [Fei] </ref> proposed a protocol conjectured to be a counterexample to the Sequential Composition "Theorem". In this paper we use the ideas of [Fei] and new results on pseudorandom distributions [GK], to prove that indeed the original formulation of zero-knowledge is not closed under sequential composition. <p> In particular, Feige and Shamir <ref> [Fei] </ref> proposed a protocol conjectured to be a counterexample to the Sequential Composition "Theorem". In this paper we use the ideas of [Fei] and new results on pseudorandom distributions [GK], to prove that indeed the original formulation of zero-knowledge is not closed under sequential composition. Our proof is independent of any intractability assumption. <p> exists for the same result with provers limited to polynomial-time, or for statistical or perfect zero-knowledge.) The reader should be aware that the Sequential Composition Theorem was proven (by Goldreich and Oren [GO, Ore]) for a stronger ("non-uniform") formulation of zero - 3 - knowledge suggested by several authors (cf. <ref> [Fei, GMR2, GO, Ore, TW] </ref>). The Sequential Composition Theorem is crucial to the utilization of zero-knowledge interactive proofs in cryptographic applications and in particular to the construction of cryptographic protocols for playing any computable game [Yao,GMW2]. <p> Later, stronger formulations of zero-knowledge were introduced in which the simulation requirement is extended to deal with stronger veriers <ref> [Fei, GMR2, GO, Ore, TW] </ref>. Namely, veriers with non-uniform properties, e.g. probabilistic polynomial-time veriers which get an additional auxiliary-input tape, or veriers modeled by polynomial-size circuits. One further formulation of zero-knowledge is called black-box simulation zero-knowledge [GO, Ore]. <p> Several authors have previously observed that this denition probably does not guarantee the robustness of zero-knowledge under sequential composition, and hence have introduced more robust formulations of zero-knowledge <ref> [Fei, GMR2, GO, Ore, TW] </ref>. But so far, no proof has been given for the claim that computational zero knowledge (with uniform veriers) fails sequential composition. <p> This intuition (presented in <ref> [Fei] </ref>) is the basis of our example of a protocol which is zero-knowledge in a single execution but reveals signicant information when composed twice in a sequence.

Reference-contexts: In other words, in the process of such proofs, the verier must ``commit'' (and later ``decommit'') to some pieces of information. In fact, such commitments are the core of the constant-round zero-knowledge proofs (and arguments) for any language in NP presented in <ref> [BCY, FS1, GK] </ref> (relying on various reasonable intractability assumptions) and in the (unconditional) zero-knowledge proof for Graph Isomorphism presented in [BMO1].

Reference-contexts: Also in this case, our proof does not rely on any unproven hypotheses; on the other hand it uses in an essential way the unbounded computational power of the prover and the computational notion of zero-knowledge. Based on intractability assumptions, Feige and Shamir <ref> [FS2] </ref> show a perfect zero-knowledge protocol with a polynomial-time prover which fails parallel composition. Our results below on 3-round zero-knowledge proofs imply a similar result but our case requires a super-logarithmic number of repetitions while in [FS2] two repetitions sufce. <p> Based on intractability assumptions, Feige and Shamir <ref> [FS2] </ref> show a perfect zero-knowledge protocol with a polynomial-time prover which fails parallel composition. Our results below on 3-round zero-knowledge proofs imply a similar result but our case requires a super-logarithmic number of repetitions while in [FS2] two repetitions sufce. By the above result we have ruled out the possibility of proving that particular interactive proofs are zero-knowledge by merely arguing that they are the result of parallel composition of various zero-knowledge protocols. <p> The fact that all known formulations of (computational) zero-knowledge are not closed under parallel composition motivates the introduction of weaker notions such as witness indistinguishability <ref> [FS2] </ref> which sufce for many applications. Namely, instead of strengthening the hypothesis of the alleged ``Parallel Composition Theorem'' (as done in the case of Sequential Composition), one relaxes the conclusion of the ``Parallel Composition Theorem'' (and this weaker conclusion turns to sufce in many applications).

Our proof is independent of any intractability assumption. <p> ON EVASIVE AND PSEUDORANDOM SETS In the demonstration of counterexamples for the "composition theorems" we make use of pseudorandom distributions which have some interesting "evasiveness" properties. These properties and the corresponding proofs are given in <ref> [GK] </ref> and cited here without proof.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION In this paper we investigate the problem of composing zero-knowledge proof systems. Zero-knowledge proof systems, introduced in the seminal paper of Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff <ref> [GMR1] </ref>, are efcient interactive proofs which have the remarkable property of yielding nothing but the validity of the assertion. Namely, whatever can be efciently computed after interacting with a zero-knowledge prover, can be efciently computed on input a valid assertion. <p> Sequential Composition Soon after the publication of the <ref> [GMR1] </ref> paper, several researchers noticed that the formulation of zero-knowledge proposed therein (hereafter referred as the original formulation) is probably not closed under sequential composition. In particular, Feige and Shamir [Fei] proposed a protocol conjectured to be a counterexample to the Sequential Composition "Theorem". <p> Namely, we introduce a pair of protocols which are (computational) zero-knowledge with respect to the strongest known denitions (including the nonuniform formulation discussed above and the "black-box simulation" formulation discussed bellow) yet their parallel composition is not zero-knowledge (not even in the "weak" sense of the original <ref> [GMR1] </ref> formulation). Also in this case, our proof does not rely on any unproven hypotheses; on the other hand it uses in an essential way the unbounded computational power of the prover and the computational notion of zero-knowledge. <p> But this does not resolve the question whether concrete cases of composed interactive proofs are zero-knowledge.

Both parties share a common input x. <p> Later, stronger formulations of zero-knowledge were introduced in which the simulation requirement is extended to deal with stronger veriers <ref> [Fei, GMR2, GO, Ore, TW] </ref>. Namely, veriers with non-uniform properties, e.g. probabilistic polynomial-time veriers which get an additional auxiliary-input tape, or veriers modeled by polynomial-size circuits. One further formulation of zero-knowledge is called black-box simulation zero-knowledge [GO, Ore]. <p> See <ref> [GMR2] </ref> for further details. - 8 - Remark: A complete formalization of the notion of black-box simulation zero-knowledge requires dealing with the following technical problem. The simulator uses V * as a black-box. <p> Several authors have previously observed that this denition probably does not guarantee the robustness of zero-knowledge under sequential composition, and hence have introduced more robust formulations of zero-knowledge <ref> [Fei, GMR2, GO, Ore, TW] </ref>. But so far, no proof has been given for the claim that computational zero knowledge (with uniform veriers) fails sequential composition.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, the above mentioned constant-round zero-knowledge proofs, as well as the constant round statistical zero-knowledge proofs of [BMO2], use secret coins. Thus, secret coins do help in the zero-knowledge setting. This should be contrasted with the result of Goldwasser and Sipser <ref> [GS] </ref> which states that Arthur-Merlin interactive proofs are equivalent to general interactive proofs (as far as language recognition is concerned). They show that any language having a general interactive proof of k rounds, has also an Arthur-Merlin proof of k rounds.

Reference-contexts: In particular, we get that bounded round Arthur-Merlin proofs which are black-box zero-knowledge exist only for BPP, while unbounded round proofs of the same type exist for all PSPACE (if one-way functions exist <ref> [IY, B*, Sha] </ref>). That is, while the nite hierarchy of languages having black-box zero-knowledge Arthur-Merlin proofs collapses to BPP (= AM (0)), the corresponding innite hierarchy contains all of PSPACE.

One further formulation of zero-knowledge is called black-box simulation zero-knowledge <ref> [GO, Ore] </ref>. This formulation differs from the former by requiring the existence of a ("universal") simulator that using any (non-uniform) verier V * as a black-box, succeeds in simulating the &lt;P,V * &gt; interaction. <p> That is, it would be desirable that the sequential composition of zero-knowledge protocols would yield a protocol which is itself zero-knowledge. Such a property is crucial for applications of zero-knowledge protocols in cryptography (for details and further motivation see <ref> [GO, Ore] </ref>). We prove that the original denition of (computational) zero-knowledge introduced by Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff in [GMR1] is not closed under sequential composition. <p> Several authors have previously observed that this denition probably does not guarantee the robustness of zero-knowledge under sequential composition, and hence have introduced more robust formulations of zero-knowledge <ref> [Fei, GMR2, GO, Ore, TW] </ref>. But so far, no proof has been given for the claim that computational zero knowledge (with uniform veriers) fails sequential composition. <p> In light of the fact that auxiliary-input zero-knowledge is robust under sequential composition <ref> [GO, Ore] </ref>, it is an interesting open question whether this formulation of zero-knowledge is also robust under parallel composition. The main result of this section is that this is not the case. <p> The three-round case can also be extended to general interactive proof systems. That is, we also have the following theorem, proved in section 6.3. Theorem 6.2: A language L has a three-round interactive proof which is black-box simulation zero-knowledge if and only if L BPP. (We remark that <ref> [GO, Ore] </ref> show that two-round (auxiliary-input) zero-knowledge proofs not necessarily black-box simulation exist only for BPP languages). Our results are optimal in the sense that there exist Arthur-Merlin interactive proofs, for languages believed to be outside BPP, with unbounded number of rounds and which are black-box simulation zero-knowledge. <p> The fact that the original formulation of zero-knowledge is not closed under sequential composition establishes the importance of augmenting this formulation by an auxiliary input (cf. <ref> [GO, Ore, TW, Gol] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Simply, modify the zero-knowledge proof for L as in the proof of Theorem 4.1. Remark: Another example of a zero-knowledge protocol which is not closed under sequential composition was independently found by D. Simon <ref> [Sim] </ref>. His construction assumes the existence of secure encryption systems. 5.
