Reference-contexts: We present the proof in two versions. The first one is based on a related result of Erd-os and Szekeres [ES35], the second one is based on its generalization, due to Chvatal and Komlos <ref> [CK71] </ref>. 2 First proof In the original proof, Erd-os and Szekeres were looking for special convex n-gons, namely for n-caps and n-cups. <p> : : : &gt; f ( ! v m1 v m ): Similarly, it is called f-nondecreasing if f ( ! v 1 v 2 ) f ( ! v 2 v 3 ) : : : f ( ! v m1 v m ): Lemma 2 (Chvatal and Komlos <ref> [CK71] </ref>) Let G be a transitive tournament with more than p2 vertices, and let f be any real-valued function defined on its edge set. Then G contains an f-decreasing directed path with p vertices or an f -nondecreasing directed path with q vertices.

Reference-contexts: Is it true that for every n there is a least number g (n) such that among any g (n) points in general position in the plane there are always n in convex position? Her question was answered in the affirmative in a classical paper of Erd-os and Szekeres <ref> [ES35] </ref>. In fact, they showed [ES35, ES60] that 2 n2 + 1 g (n) 2n 4 ! The lower bound, 2 n2 + 1, is sharp for n = 2; 3; 4; 5 and has been conjectured to be sharp for all n. <p> In fact, they showed <ref> [ES35, ES60] </ref> that 2 n2 + 1 g (n) 2n 4 ! The lower bound, 2 n2 + 1, is sharp for n = 2; 3; 4; 5 and has been conjectured to be sharp for all n. <p> In other words, g (n) n2 + 2. Since 2 n2 = 2n4 , our upper bound is about a half of the original bound of Erd-os and Szekeres. We present the proof in two versions. The first one is based on a related result of Erd-os and Szekeres <ref> [ES35] </ref>, the second one is based on its generalization, due to Chvatal and Komlos [CK71]. 2 First proof In the original proof, Erd-os and Szekeres were looking for special convex n-gons, namely for n-caps and n-cups. <p> &lt; x n , form an n-cap if y 2 y 1 &gt; x 3 x 2 y n y n1 : - 2 - Similarly, they form an n-cup if y 2 y 1 &lt; x 3 x 2 y n y n1 : Lemma 1 (Erd-os and Szekeres <ref> [ES35] </ref>) Let f (n, m) be the least integer such that any set of f (n; m) points in general position in the plane contains either an n-cap or an m-cup.
