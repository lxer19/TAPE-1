Reference-contexts: Fosdick Elizabeth R. Jessup September 5, 1995 The course "High-Performance Scientific Computing" assumes an introductory knowledge of numerical analysis such as you might gain from any of a number of textbooks; this includes the ones by Conte and deBoor <ref> [Conte & de Boor 80] </ref>, Dahlquist and Bjork [Dahlquist & Bjorck 74], or Ka-haner, Moler and Nash [Kahaner et al 89]. These are referred to as CdB, DB, and KMN in the sequel. <p> There are also matrix norms consistent with the two vector norms k k 1 and k k 2 defined by equations (4) and (5). For more information on matrix norms, see <ref> [Conte & de Boor 80] </ref> or [Golub & Van Loan 89].

Reference-contexts: Many computers use the IEEE standard for floating-point arithmetic which is defined in the document An American National Standard & IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic. It is informally described in the tutorial Elements of IEEE Arithmetic <ref> [Fosdick 95] </ref> 1 .

Reference-contexts: There are also matrix norms consistent with the two vector norms k k 1 and k k 2 defined by equations (4) and (5). For more information on matrix norms, see [Conte & de Boor 80] or <ref> [Golub & Van Loan 89] </ref>. <p> There are several numerical methods for finding ^x and so solving the least squares prob lem, but we do not review them here.

Reference-contexts: The elements of W 1 should be evident from this example. For more information on the FFT, see the Tomography tutorial <ref> [Jessup 95] </ref>. F is called the discrete Fourier transform of f , and f is called the inverse Fourier transform of F .

The purpose of this review is simply to record definitions, formulas, and concepts you are expected to know; and to define the notation we will use.
