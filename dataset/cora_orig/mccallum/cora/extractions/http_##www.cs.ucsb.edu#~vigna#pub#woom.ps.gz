Reference-contexts: checkers, that allow to flag out errors in the syntax of an HTML document; link validators, that verify that each hypertext reference in an HTML page has a valid destination; active resources development tools, that support the development of client and serverside programs like CGI scripts or applets (e.g., Jamba <ref> [1] </ref> or ScriptDebugger [18]). A site-oriented approach abstracts away from single resources and tries to provide the developer with a general view of the whole site. The developer can define the overall Web site structure in terms of resources (pages, images, etc.) and folders.

Reference-contexts: A design-oriented approach tries to provide primitives and notations that compensate for such lack of high-level abstractions. This approach applies the results of research on hypermedia design to the World Wide Web domain. Design notations like HDM [ 9], RMDM <ref> [ 2] </ref> or OOHDM [ 23], support the developer in modeling the information of the application domain under consideration in terms of entities and relationships among entities.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The World Wide Web (WWW) is evolving at an incredibly fast pace. From its first introduction in 1990 <ref> [3] </ref>, the WWW has been changing both in size, technology, and intended use. The number of WWW sites has increased exponentially as Internet users understood the benefits that could stem from a globally connected hypermedia system.

Reference-contexts: This model instance is subsequently translated into a WBM instance that, eventually, is mapped into the constructs of the conventional Web technology. This process is similar to the conventional software development process. After requirements specification, a design phase is carried out using, for instance, the Booch notation <ref> [ 4] </ref>. Then, the design is implemented using a tool (a programming language [ 11], e.g., C++) that supports the implementation of design concepts by means of suitable abstractions. <p> Elements can belong to just one hyper page. Each element has an associated set of 8 attributes that specify its behavior. Figure 4 outlines the class diagram <ref> [ 4] </ref> for WBM 1 resources and elements. Each class of resources has an associated projection operation that takes some parameters and returns a multimedia object, which represents the view of the resource contents that is actually delivered to the user as a response to a resource request.

Reference-contexts: In fact, while the first implementation of the WWW system was finalized to the distribution of scientific information, the present WWW infrastructure 2 is becoming a platform for the development of distributed applications providing advanced services to users <ref> [5] </ref>. This promising scenario is characterized by an unstructured, or even chaotic, evolution and lack of methodologies. Most of the current research efforts focus on the development of new technologies or on the integration of the existing ones in a WWW setting.

Reference-contexts: The underlying technology has evolved to include active contents in static hypertext pages by means of languages and technologies like Java [ 14] or ActiveX [ 16], scripting languages for browsers like VBScript [ 19] or JavaScript <ref> [ 6] </ref>, support for image animation, and so on. This technological improvement has been used as the lever fulcrum for the shift from the mere distribution of information towards the provision of services.

Reference-contexts: This step provides the developer with the notations for the design of the application. For this purpose we use an existing hypermedia design model, namely HDM (Hypertext Design Model) <ref> [7] </ref>. 6 Finally, a further abstraction step defines concepts and notations for hypermedia requirement elicitation, representation, and analysis. If Figure 1-a is interpreted top-down, the corresponding development process proceeds though a number of phases (see Figure 1-b).

Reference-contexts: A careful design activity should highlight the fundamental constituents of a site, abstracting away from low-level implementation details, and should allow the designer to identify recurring structures or navigation patterns to be reused <ref> [ 8] </ref>. As such, a good design can survive the frequent changes in the implementation, fostered by the appearance of new technologies. Being largely implementation-independent, the design activity can be carried out using notations and methodologies that are not explicitly web-oriented; any design model for hypermedia applications could be used.

This approach applies the results of research on hypermedia design to the World Wide Web domain.

In the following, we will adopt the HDM (Hypertext Design Model) notation <ref> [ 9] </ref>, shortly described in the rest of this subsection. In designing a hypermedia, HDM distinguishes between the hyperbase layer and the access layer.

Reference-contexts: The tools that are based on this approach allow the developer to work with the model entities and then, as in the case the site-oriented tools, to create a real-world Web site via a publishing process. A notable example of this approach is WebComposition <ref> [10] </ref>. In WebComposition, Web entities are modeled by component objects with a state and a set of operations that specify the components behavior. Components can be derived by other components using prototyping and can be reused. Our approach described in this paper can be classified as both design-based and model-based.

Reference-contexts: This process is similar to the conventional software development process. After requirements specification, a design phase is carried out using, for instance, the Booch notation [ 4]. Then, the design is implemented using a tool (a programming language <ref> [ 11] </ref>, e.g., C++) that supports the implementation of design concepts by means of suitable abstractions. The high-level implementation is then translated to a lower-level description (such as bytecode or assembly code), that is quite close to the final machine language.

Reference-contexts: This problem is particularly critical since WWW systems, by their very nature, are subject to frequent updates and even redesigns. Software engineering research has delivered technologies (e.g., objectoriented programming languages), methodologies (e.g., design paradigms), and tools (e.g., integrated development environments) that support the software development process <ref> [12] </ref>. Being effectively supported, software developers are able to deliver quality products in a timely and cost-effective manner. A similar approach has to be followed in order to bring WWW development out of its immaturity.

Reference-contexts: A resource-oriented approach focuses on the information elements that compose a site. This approach provides tools for the development and management of a single resource as an HTML page or an image. Example of tools that belong to this approach are HTML editors , like Hot Metal <ref> [ 13] </ref> [ 24] and Netscape Editor [ 21], that support the development of single HTML pages by providing syntax-driven editing and WYSIWYG interfaces; format converters, that allow a user to translate information into a format that is suitable to inclusion in a Web site (e.g., Word-to-HTML translators); image editors, that

Reference-contexts: Almost every company, organization, and university owns a WWW site that provides information and services for customers and users. The underlying technology has evolved to include active contents in static hypertext pages by means of languages and technologies like Java <ref> [ 14] </ref> or ActiveX [ 16], scripting languages for browsers like VBScript [ 19] or JavaScript [ 6], support for image animation, and so on. This technological improvement has been used as the lever fulcrum for the shift from the mere distribution of information towards the provision of services.

Reference-contexts: If the presentation of an occurrence in a certain context must be changed, only transformers must be modified. 20 By using resource and elements attributes, it is possible to perform resource and element versioning and benefit from good configuration management practices <ref> [ 15] </ref>. In addition, it is possible to track information aging at any level of granularity. Every element and resource can have an associated expiration date attribute. It is then possible to use the transformer mechanism to hide expired information, or to highlight new information in a completely automatic way.

Reference-contexts: In addition, these tools support site-oriented management tasks like link validation or site restructuring. A notable example of this approach is Microsoft FrontPage <ref> [17] </ref>, which provides an integrated environment for Web site development. FrontPage offers wizards and templates for fast creation of groups of pages, and a basic mechanism, called WebBot, that allows the developer to associate an HTML page with a script that is invoked during the publishing process.

Reference-contexts: Most WWW developers do not follow a well-defined development process and, after a first vague requirements acquisition and informal design phase, they put all their effort in the implementation phase. Thus, they have to implement high-level requirements and design concepts with low-level technology, such as HTML <ref> [ 22] </ref>, that does not provide suitable constructs. Using the analogy with conventional software development, this approach corresponds to implementing high-level software designs through direct mapping into an assembly-level language.
