Title: Disambiguation and Grammar as Emergent Soft Constraints

Abstract: When reading a sentence such as "The diplomat threw the ball in the ballpark for the princess" our interpretation changes from a dance event to baseball and back to dance. Such on-line disambiguation happens automatically and appears to be based on dynamically combining the strengths of association between the keywords and the two senses. Subsymbolic neural networks are very good at modeling such behavior. They learn word meanings as soft constraints on interpretation, and dynamically combine these constraints to form the most likely interpretation. On the other hand, it is very difficult to show how systematic language structures such as relative clauses could be processed in such a system. The network would only learn to associate them to specific contexts and would not be able to process new combinations of them. A closer look at understanding embedded clauses shows that humans are not very systematic in processing grammatical structures either. For example, "The girl who the boy who the girl who lived next door blamed hit cried" is very difficult to understand, whereas "The car that the man who the dog that had rabies bit drives is in the garage" is not. This difference emerges from the same semantic constraints that are at work in the disambiguation task. In this chapter we will show how the subsymbolic parser can be combined with high-level control that allows the system to process novel combinations of relative clauses systematically, while still being sensitive to the semantic constraints.

Reference-contexts: The inferencing capabilities can be verified against the corpora. Cognitive validity can be tested at least in part by comparing the model with grammaticality judgements in humans <ref> (Gibson 1997) </ref>. What is difficult for humans should also be difficult for the model. The model could then be used to generate predictions on areas where not much is known about human performance and processes.

Reference-contexts: Processing in neural networks is based on precisely the same principles. Trained to associate a set of input patterns to a set of output patterns, the network learns correlations in the data. For each new input pattern, the network then forms the most likely output given the training data <ref> (Hertz et al. 1991) </ref>. If the sentence interpretation task can be cast as a mapping from a sequence of input words to a representation of the meaning of the sentence, sentence processing can be modeled with neural networks.

Reference-contexts: The search process for the appropriate meaning takes place serially, terminating when a fit is made, or retaining the most dominant meaning when no contextually relevant match can be found. In the strongest statement of the model <ref> (Hogaboam and Perfetti 1975) </ref>, only the most dominant meaning of an ambiguous word is retrieved first, regardless of whether the context supports a subordinate meaning.

Reference-contexts: However, it is not sufficient for explaining how dynamic inferencing comes about, where constraints that have previously been seen only in separate contexts must be combined. For example, in the sentence <ref> (due to Lange and Dyer 1989) </ref> John put the pot in the dishwasher because the police were coming, if dishwasher and police have never been seen together before, there is no basis for statistically combining the contexts they represent.

Reference-contexts: This way the Segmenter implements the high-level strategy of parsing sentences with relative clauses. Although the Segmenter was originally found necessary for computational reasons (i.e. for generalization to new sentence structures), it can also be motivated in a more general cognitive framework of perspective shifts in processing relative clauses <ref> (MacWhinney 1977, 1988) </ref>. When a relative pronoun is encountered, a perspective shift is initiated: The current clause is temporarily suspended, and a new clause is started with possibly new agent or patient, introducing a new perspective. The Segmenter is a mechanism for carrying out this shift.

Reference-contexts: FGREP is a convenient way for forming these representations, but SPEC is not dependent on FGREP. The word representations could have been obtained through semantic feature encoding <ref> (McClelland and Kawamoto 1986) </ref> as well, or even assigned randomly.

Reference-contexts: Tables 2 and 3 summarize the sense values of each word. This representation strategy was chosen because it makes the disambiguation process transparent. To see what the network is thinking, it is enough to look at the values of the sense units at its output. Distributed word representations <ref> (e.g. Miikkulainen 1993) </ref> could be used as well, but sense would then have to be calculated based on distances between representation vectors. The sense values were then used to put together a set of training sentences that made the sense associations explicit.
