Reference-contexts: jEj=(4 (r (k)) 2 ) length of S O (n): Consequently, jEj 4 (r (k)) 2 O (n) = O (n): 2 To complete the proof of Theorems 1 and 2, it remains to prove Lemmas 4 and 5. 4 Proof of Lemma 4 We apply a simple greedy algorithm <ref> [1] </ref> which, for given integer l 1 and finite sequence A, returns an l-regular subsequence B (A; l) of A. At the beginning of the algorithm, an auxiliary sequence B is taken empty.

Reference-contexts: This result was improved by Pach, Sharokhi, and Szegedy [9] who proved that any graph drawing on n vertices with no k pairwise crossing edges contains at most O (n log 2k4 n) edges (k 3). This bound was further improved to O (n log 2k6 n) in <ref> [2] </ref> (k 3) (thus, in particular, to O (n) for k = 3). In [12] we improved the bound for geometric graphs to O (n log n) (for k 4). Theorem 1 Let k 4 be a constant.

Reference-contexts: It is well-known <ref> [3] </ref> (and not difficult to prove) that any 2-regular sequence over an n-element alphabet containing no alternating subsequence of length 4 has length at most 2n 1. In the proof of Theorems 1 and 2 we apply the following more general result.

Reference-contexts: It follows from Dilworth's theorem <ref> [4] </ref> that either there are two elements in L which are not comparable by any of the partial orders - 7 - s 2 (r (k)) 2 1 s 1 v 3 a 1 a 3 i , or one of the partial orders i contains a chain of length k.

Reference-contexts: Further, let a i be the arc emanating from the vertex v i and passing through the point on the y-axis corresponding to s 2 (r (k)) 2 i (see Fig. 1). We may assume that the coordinates x i are pairwise different. By the Erd-os-Szekeres theorem <ref> [5] </ref>, the sequence x 1 ; x 2 ; : : : ; x (r (k)) 2 contains a monotone subsequence of length r (k).

Reference-contexts: In the proof of Theorems 1 and 2 we apply the following more general result. Theorem 3 (Klazar and Valtr <ref> [6] </ref>) Let l 2 be a constant. Then the length of any l-regular sequence over an n-element alphabet containing no subsequence of type up-down-up (l) has length at most O (n). - 2 - 3 Proof of Theorems 1 and 2 Theorem 1 is weaker than Theorem 2.

Reference-contexts: Euler's formula shows that this number is 3n 6 for k = 2 (and n 3). Pach <ref> [7] </ref> proved that any geometric graph with no 3 pairwise crossing edges contains at most 13n 3=2 edges, and that any geometric graph with no k pairwise crossing edges contains at most O (n 21=(25k 2 ) ) edges.

Reference-contexts: A geometric graph is a graph drawing in which all arcs are straight line segments. See <ref> [8] </ref> for a survey of results about geometric graphs. Most papers on geometric graphs deal with the crossing number or with extremal questions motivated by extremal graph theory and Ramsey theory.

Reference-contexts: Pach [7] proved that any geometric graph with no 3 pairwise crossing edges contains at most 13n 3=2 edges, and that any geometric graph with no k pairwise crossing edges contains at most O (n 21=(25k 2 ) ) edges. This result was improved by Pach, Sharokhi, and Szegedy <ref> [9] </ref> who proved that any graph drawing on n vertices with no k pairwise crossing edges contains at most O (n log 2k4 n) edges (k 3).

Reference-contexts: See [8] for a survey of results about geometric graphs. Most papers on geometric graphs deal with the crossing number or with extremal questions motivated by extremal graph theory and Ramsey theory. One of the extremal results is due to Pach and Tor-ocsik <ref> [10] </ref> who proved that any geometric graph on n vertices with no k pairwise disjoint edges contains at most (k 1) 4 n edges.

Reference-contexts: An edge v i v j with x i &lt; x j is colored blue if v j lies below the arc a i , otherwise its color is red. By Ramsey's theorem <ref> [11] </ref>, our graph contains a monochromatic complete subgraph on k vertices. For simplicity of notation and without loss of generality, we assume that the complete subgraph on vertices v 1 ; v 2 ; ; v k is monochromatic. Then, one of the four cases in Figures 2-5, respectively, applies.

Reference-contexts: This bound was further improved to O (n log 2k6 n) in [2] (k 3) (thus, in particular, to O (n) for k = 3). In <ref> [12] </ref> we improved the bound for geometric graphs to O (n log n) (for k 4). Theorem 1 Let k 4 be a constant. Then any geometric graph on n vertices with no k pairwise crossing edges has at most O (n log n) edges.
