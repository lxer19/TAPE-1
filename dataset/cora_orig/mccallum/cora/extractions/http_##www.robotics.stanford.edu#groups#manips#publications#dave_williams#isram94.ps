Abstract: This paper discusses multi-grasp manipulation with independent control of internal forces. The method we present is based on the integration of two basic models: the virtual linkage and the augmented object. These models provide a characterization of internal forces, a description of the dynamics at the manipulated object, and the dynamics of internal forces. Using these dynamic models, we propose a general control structure for decoupled object behavior. Results of simulation as well as experimentation for a set of three cooperating

Reference-contexts: In early work, control of multi-arm robot systems has been viewed as a motion coordination problem [9]. These methods are typically developed in the context of two-arm systems. In addition, such methods rely on accurate joint position control to avoid excessive internal forces. The augmented object model <ref> [2] </ref> presented in this paper provides a description of the system's dynamics at the manipulated object level. Control of internal forces is also crucial in multi-grasp manipulation. <p> OBJECT-LEVEL CONTROL To effectively control internal forces, the virtual linkage method must be integrated with a controller that accounts for the closed-chain dynamics of a multi-grasp system. Such a controller was developed in <ref> [2] </ref>, and introduced the augmented object concept to characterize the rigid-body dynamics of these systems.

Reference-contexts: Control of internal forces is also crucial in multi-grasp manipulation. In [4], the authors propose an extension of their earlier work on unilateral constraints to allow control of multiple-grasp systems with dynamic control of contact conditions. A different approach is presented in <ref> [3] </ref> where internal forces are minimized by requiring each arm to apply an equal force at some reference point on the object. A model-following technique is then used to provide a reference trajectory for each arm based on the desired state and the actual position and forces.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Research dealing with the characterization of internal forces and moments has focused essentially on two issues; minimizing internal forces during manipulation [6], or determining a set of grasp forces that satisfy frictional and stability constraints for point contact without applying excessive force to the manipulated object <ref> [5] </ref>. Typically these approaches establish a relationship between the forces applied to an object and the resultant of these forces at some reference point. A generalized inverse is used to solve this relationship.

Reference-contexts: To characterize internal forces, it is important to develop a model that is both physically meaningful and of reasonable complexity to allow real-time implementation. To meet these criteria, we describe internal forces by representing the grasped object with an equivalent virtual linkage <ref> [7] </ref>, defined as follows: A virtual linkage associated with an n-grasp manipulation task is a 6 (n 1)-degree-of-freedom mechanism whose actuated joints charac terize the object's internal forces and moments. <p> There is a one-to-one correspondence between the amount of actuator redundancy and the number of internal forces and moments. This ensures that each internal force can be controlled independently. The Grasp Description Matrix It has been shown <ref> [7] </ref> that the relationship between forces and moments applied to the object at the grasp points (f i ), the resultant force and moment at some reference point (F R ), and the internal forces and moments (F I ), can be written as F t = F R # 2 <p> Explicit formulas for G and G 1 are given in <ref> [7] </ref>. For some grasp configurations, the rank of the grasp description matrix G might be deficient. In such a situation, the virtual linkage is at a kinematic singularity; two or more adjacent members are aligned.
