Abstract: We study the performance of TCP/IP on a multi-hop ATM network by simulation in an effort to evaluate the effectiveness of various congestion-control schemes at the ATM layer. The congestion control schemes considered are the ATM-Early Packet Discard (ATM-EPD) and link-level flow control. The performance of these schemes are compared against that of an ATM layer with no congestion control, as well as TCP/IP over a datagram network. We compare the schemes in terms of the throughputs obtained by long and short connections, number of retransmissions, and fairness in bandwidth allocation between connections with unequal round-trip delays. Our results show that significant unfairness in the amount of bandwidth allocated to connections may result in a large ATM network if no congestion control policies are used at the ATM layer. The ATM-EPD scheme is able to remove some of the unfairness, providing performance close to that of a datagram network, but can still provide unacceptable performance if the buffer sizes in the switches are small. Link-level flow control provided the best performance among the schemes studied.

Reference-contexts: The simulation results do not include the first 0.5 second of simulation time to avoid the effects caused by the simultaneous opening of all the TCP connections. For the simulations of TCP over ATM networks, we used the ATM Adaptation Layer Type 5 (AAL 5) <ref> [1] </ref>. For simulations of TCP over datagram networks, the switches perform the role of IP routers. For the remaining schemes, the switches operate at the ATM layer. For simulations with no ATM-layer congestion control, the switches are nonblocking, output-buffered crossbars.

The actual flow control scheme implemented was the N 23 scheme described by Kung and Chapman <ref> [10] </ref>. 4. TCP over a datagram network obtained by replacing each of the ATM switches in Figure 1 with IP gateways. No gateway congestion control policies were im plemented in the IP gateways. The IP layer was simulated with a single queue per output port.

Reference-contexts: III. Simulation Results In this section we present the simulation results for the four congestion-control schemes discussed in the previous section. Only a part of the results from our simulations are presented here; more detailed results can be found in <ref> [20] </ref>. These results focus primarily on the throughput obtained by the individual connections, number of retransmissions in the network, and fairness in bandwidth allocation among the competing connections.
