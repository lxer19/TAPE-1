Reference-contexts: These factors range from having to support different patterns of node mobility to integrating the traffic generators, networking algorithms, and operating system capabilities. A few operating system kernels and languages have been designed to support wireless and mobile communication <ref> [1] </ref>, and a number of protocols have been devised to solve the numerous topology setup and maintenance, media access control, and trans mission problems in the mobile environment [11]. Commercial radios designed to be hooked up with laptops for wireless multimedia transmissions are available in the market.

Reference-contexts: This is a dramatic increase in speed compared to other simulation packages. If the user desires, a Maisie hold () function can be used to slow down the simulation clock to match up with the real-time clock <ref> [2] </ref>. 3.4.1 Control Parameters The interactive buttons at the top of the screen can be used for either exiting the simulation, stepping through the next interaction of the clusterhead election algorithm after moving the nodes, or continuously running through the algorithms and moving the nodes. <p> The experiments reported in this study used only the sequential Maisie implementations. Parallel Maisie implementations have yielded significant performance improvements for a number of applications that include circuitsim ulation [4], queueing networks <ref> [2] </ref>, and data parallel programs. We intend to explore the viability of the parallel implementation in improving the performance of simulation models for wireless networks such as those described in this paper. We are also currently extending this simulation environment to support nomadic comput ing issues [15]. 7.

Reference-contexts: The simulation environment can be used to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of algorithms as a function of the application requirements, mobility patterns, and radio characteristics. The simulator is being built on top of an existing message-passing based parallel simula tion language called Maisie <ref> [3] </ref>. The Maisie simulation environment has been implemented on a variety of workstations, on networks of workstations and on distributed memory multicomput-ers like the IBM SP1 and on a shared memory Sparc 1000. <p> We plan to integrate the two preceding models to study the performance of the protocols as a function of the radio and NOS characteristics. The simulation environment was designed using an existing sim ulation language call Maisie <ref> [3] </ref>. Maisie has been implemented on both sequential and parallel architectures including distributed memory machines like the IBM SP2 and shared-memory multiprocessor machines like the Sun Sparc 1000. The experiments reported in this study used only the sequential Maisie implementations.

Reference-contexts: A public domain network operating system, NOS (also known as KA9Q developed by Phil Karn), has readily available source code and meets the flex ibility requirements <ref> [5] </ref>. We use this network operating system in our test-bench [Figure 3]. It runs on top of DOS and includes its own multitasking scheduler. The benefit of this multitasking operating system is that each algorithm or protocol necessary to support this network can be developed as its own process.

Reference-contexts: Measurements such as Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) are fed back from the radio into the link control algorithms to do power control and minimize the power consumption of the link, reduce interference, and provide admission control such as described in <ref> [7] </ref>. 3. Simulation Environment We have designed a general purpose parallel environment for the simulation of mobile wireless network systems and provide an implementation path for networking algorithms. <p> Each node also knows who its neighbors are. Each node does not have any global knowledge of the topology. The data link layer models are used to provide mobility and link level control such as power control <ref> [7] </ref> (utilizing various power lev els available on the radio and adapting the SIR measurement), media access control via a TDMA based time frame [11], error control such as the spreading factor which the radio transmits on, the CRC functions, and possibly even the ReedSolomon forward error correction, and lastly the

Reference-contexts: The system integration and networking support issues and analysis will become critical since these multimedia devices place greater demands on the system architecture, such as bus bandwidth, and networking services, such as virtual circuits. 2.4 Wireless Communication Hardware There are numerous wireless radio modems commercially avail able <ref> [10] </ref>. Many of the algorithms being designed for mobile wireless systems are built to support a particular device/manufacturer. Algorithms which are not designed for a specific radio face the problem of trying to predict the performance of their algorithms over such a wide parameter space of available radio alternatives.

Reference-contexts: A few operating system kernels and languages have been designed to support wireless and mobile communication [1], and a number of protocols have been devised to solve the numerous topology setup and maintenance, media access control, and trans mission problems in the mobile environment <ref> [11] </ref>. Commercial radios designed to be hooked up with laptops for wireless multimedia transmissions are available in the market. <p> Many of the proposed schemes for supporting instant and reconfigurable network topologies are based upon TDMA to control channel contention. A clustering algorithm <ref> [11] </ref> was implemented which is heavily based on TDMA control and synchronization to test the feasibility and overhead of implementing this functionality in software. 2.6 Link Layer Control Algorithms developed for link layer control fall into a separate category from other networking algorithms. <p> The subnetwork layer models are used to model the topology creation (instant infrastructure), reconfigurability, adaptive channel assignment (CDMA), and wireless multihop routing. As an example of a NA M, below is a Maisie fragment for the clusterhead election algorithm found in <ref> [11] </ref>. The basic idea of the algorithm is that between any two nodes that can communicate, the node with the lowest ID should become the clusterhead with the Appl. Trans. Pkt.

Reference-contexts: Other mobile wireless network systems are not be focused on instant infrastructure networks, but upon support mobility throughout the internet. 2.5.2 Mobile IP The IETF Working Group for Mobile IP has developed an Inter net Draft for IP Mobility Support <ref> [12] </ref>. Much of the focus of this group has been on protocol functionality and standards not on performance analysis. <p> The Internet Protocol is commonly used either in its entirety or just a model of IP to provide functions such as domain addressing, routing, segmentation, and reassembly. Other protocols modeled in this layer include the ICMP for control messages and Mobile IP <ref> [12] </ref> for mobility tracking and support of roaming through the internet. The wireless subnet, whether it be a base station and its clients or a wireless multihop cluster are found in the subnetwork layer.

Reference-contexts: These transport protocols interact with the applications described in the previous section by using sockets to buffer the bit stream so packetization can take place. Additional services are also being developed to support multimedia over mobile hosts <ref> [13] </ref> Although wireless communication is useful to support mobile communication, wired connections can support much higher bandwidth and are less prone to errors then wireless radios. Therefore, wired connections should be utilized whenever possible.
