Reference-contexts: WERSCHULZ The reader may note a similarity between the result that a linear ill-posed problem is unsolvable and a result from computability theory. In [11], it is shown that a linear operator preserves computability iff it is bounded. There has been considerable interest in this result; see, for example, <ref> [1] </ref> and [10, pp. 188, 215]. The results in [11] and [17] indicate a reassuring robustness. In the context of computability theory, Pour-El and Richards show that a linear unbounded transformation causes noncomputability.

Reference-contexts: Several attempts to do this for Gaussian measures were unsuccessful. This suggested the question: Is every linear problem well-posed on the average for any Gaussian measure? This question was answered in the affirmative in <ref> [5] </ref> and [15]. The conclusion in the title follows immediately from this and the preceding result. What if the measure is non-Gaussian? Now the situation is more complicated. In particular, there are problems that are even ill-posed on the average. <p> This is an instance of a general property, as stated in the following theorem, which was proven independently in <ref> [5] </ref> and [15]: Theorem 7. Let S : D F 1 ! G be a measurable linear transformation of separable Banach spaces.

Reference-contexts: We use the information Nf to obtain an approximation (Nf ) to Sf . We say that is an algorithm using the information N . This formulation is used in information-based complexity; see [13], [14], or [19]. The same formulation is used in optimal recovery; see <ref> [7] </ref> or [8]. The quality of an algorithm using information N is given by its error e (; N ). How this error is defined depends on which setting is used. We consider the worst case setting in Section 3, and the average case setting in Sections 4 and 5.

Reference-contexts: Then the problem is either weakly solvable or solvable. For further details, see [18]. We also note that regularization methods (see, e.g., <ref> [9] </ref>), which are often used to solve ill-posed problems, do not claim to solve these problems in the worst case setting. Instead, they provide a solution in an asymptotic setting, this setting being described in Chapter 10 of [14]. 4.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we shall consider this latter form of the problem. Note that many other mathematical problems (besides inverse problems) can be stated as obtaining Sf for some f 2 D, where S is a linear or nonlinear operator, see <ref> [13] </ref>, [14], or [19]. We say that S is the solution operator for our problem. In this paper we further confine ourselves to linear problems. <p> Because N is many-to-one, we cannot compute Sf exactly. We have to settle for an approximation. We use the information Nf to obtain an approximation (Nf ) to Sf . We say that is an algorithm using the information N . This formulation is used in information-based complexity; see <ref> [13] </ref>, [14], or [19]. The same formulation is used in optimal recovery; see [7] or [8]. The quality of an algorithm using information N is given by its error e (; N ). How this error is defined depends on which setting is used. <p> Since weak solvability will generally not be enough for our needs (we might not be able to find an algorithm whose error is small enough), we want to distinguish between these classes of problems. Using Theorem 1, along with results found in Chapter 2 of <ref> [13] </ref>, we have the following trichotomy theorem characterizing the solvability of linear problems in a Hilbert setting: Theorem 3.

Reference-contexts: Such a problem can at best only be solved approximately. We say a problem is solvable if we can compute an "-approximation for any positive " and is unsolvable if we cannot compute an "-approximation, even for arbitrarily large ". It was shown in <ref> [17] </ref> that a linear problem is unsolvable iff it is ill-posed. Are there circumstances under which one can avoid this negative conclusion? It is common to associate an operator S with an ill-posed problem. If S is linear, then a problem is ill-posed iff S is unbounded. <p> This suggests introducing the concept of a problem's being ill-posed on the average if the expectation of S with respect to a measure is infinite and being well-posed on the average if this expectation is finite. These concepts were introduced in <ref> [17] </ref>, where it was shown that if the measure is Gaussian and the linear operator S is measurable, then a linear problem is unsolvable on the average iff it is ill-posed on the average. <p> In [11], it is shown that a linear operator preserves computability iff it is bounded. There has been considerable interest in this result; see, for example, [1] and [10, pp. 188, 215]. The results in [11] and <ref> [17] </ref> indicate a reassuring robustness. In the context of computability theory, Pour-El and Richards show that a linear unbounded transformation causes noncomputability. <p> Finally, in this section, the terms solvable, weakly solvable, and unsolvable will always mean in the worst case setting. The following theorem for the worst case setting was proven in <ref> [17] </ref>: 2 This is not to be confused with the weak solution of an operator equation. ILL-POSED PROBLEMS ARE SOLVABLE ON THE AVERAGE 5 Theorem 1. A linear problem is unsolvable iff it is ill-posed. fl Main example (continued). <p> the next theorem, which says that no algorithm, no matter how sophisticated, can do substantially better than the zero algorithm 0 , which is defined by 0 (Nf ) 0 8f 2 D: (The zero algorithm is arguably the most naive algorithm imaginable.) Then we have the following result from <ref> [17] </ref>: Theorem 2. Let q 2 [0; 1). <p> One might be able to show that if an ill-posed problem is well-posed on the average, then it is solvable on the average. This motivated Werschulz to initiate the average case study of ill-posed problems, see <ref> [17] </ref>. In the rest of this paper, we consider an average case setting, where we replace the requirement that the error be always at most " by the weaker requirement that the expected error be at most ".
