Abstract: In "Principia Mathematica" [17], B. Russell and A.N. Whitehead propose a type system for higher order logic. This system has become known under the name "ramified type theory". It was invented to avoid the paradoxes, which could be conducted from Frege's "Begriffschrift" [7]. We give a formalization of the ramified type theory as described in the Principia Mathematica, trying to keep it as close as possible to the ideas of the Principia. As an alternative, distancing ourselves from the Principia, we express notions from the ramified type theory in a lambda calculus style, thus clarifying the type system of Russell and Whitehead in a contemporary setting. Both formalizations are inspired by current developments in research on type theory and typed lambda calculus; see e.g. [3]. In these formalizations, and also when defining "truth", we will need the notion of substitution. As substitution is not formally defined in the Principia, we have to define it ourselves. Finally, the reaction by Hilbert and Ackermann in [10] on the ramified theory of types, resulting in the "simple type theory", is described.

Reference-contexts: The convention to take different variables for bound and free variables is well known in -calculus as the "variable-convention" or "Barendregt-convention" (see for instance <ref> [2] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Proof: Induction on ` f : t a . 2 When we look at our renewed system, we see that it has many characteristics of the type systems in, for example, the Barendregt cube (see <ref> [3] </ref>): Rules 1 and 2 provide a "start", rules 3 and 4 together can be seen as an abstraction rule, rule 5 is a weakening rule and rule 6 can be seen as an application rule.

Reference-contexts: Though this paradox was not the first one and certainly not the only one in the history of logic and mathematics ([4], Chapter 17, presents a list of paradoxes), Russell's paradox is regarded as the most fundamental one (for instance in <ref> [6] </ref>, pp. 1-7): it is a paradox that arises at the most elementary level of logic. A solution to this paradox had to be found, and one of these solutions was proposed by Russell himself: the theory of (ramified) types.

Reference-contexts: It appears that the system isn't easy to handle with. The main reason for this is the use of the ramification. We illustrate this with an example. Example 11.1 (Equality) One tends to define the notion of equality in the style of Leibniz <ref> [8] </ref>: x = y $ 8z [z (x) $ z (y)]; or in words: Two individuals are equal if and only if they have exactly the same properties.

Reference-contexts: We must depend on our intuition and on the way in which substitution is used in the Principia. Unfortunately, there are no really complex examples of the use of substitution in the Principia. 8 It is important to note that a variable is not a pseudomatrix. See for instance <ref> [12] </ref>, Chapter viii: "The variable", p.94 of the 7th impression. 9 See for instance: Introduction, Chapter II, Section ii about the nature of propositional functions 5 Remark 2.3 Note that pseudomatrices do not obey to the Vicious Circle Principle 1.1 yet! :z (z) is, for example, a pseudomatrix. <p> In modern type systems, a variable is a term. We cannot have this in our system. In <ref> [12] </ref>, Russell writes 27 : "A variable is not any term simply, but any term as entering into a propositional function." In system rtt, we can derive, for instance, z : () 0 ` z () : (() 0 ) 1 while, regarding modern type systems, one should expect z :

Reference-contexts: Russell shows that the Russell Paradox, and some other paradoxes, can not be derived when one accepts the vicious circle principle and the theory of ramified types 4 . The Theory of Types was introduced in <ref> [13] </ref> (1908) and in the famous "Principia Mathematica" ([17], 1910-1912). In the "Principia", Russell and Whitehead try to base the whole of mathematics on logic. The result is a very formal and accurate build-up of mathematics. But the fundamentals, among which the theory of types, are not presented that formally.

Reference-contexts: To compute the order of a formula (in prenex normal form), one should compute the order of this formula without quantifiers: Adding the quantifiers afterwards does not change the order of the formula. 11 The Axiom of Reducibility We can define a notion of truth in Tarski's style (see <ref> [14] </ref>) on our formal system. Then our system is complete and we can play with it. It appears that the system isn't easy to handle with. The main reason for this is the use of the ramification. We illustrate this with an example.

There is an easy solution to this problem: Just skip the notion of matrix, substitute the word "formula" for the word "matrix" everywhere in the definition rtt and add an extra rule: 8.

Remark 3.2 (Simple) types are not explicitly introduced in the Principia. But there is a definition of "being of the same type" 10 , on which definition 3.1 is based.
