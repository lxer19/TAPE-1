Reference: [1] <author> C. J. Alpert, T. C. Hu, J. H. Huang, and A. B. Kahng, </author> <title> A Direct Combination of the Prim and Dijkstra Constructions for Improved Performance-Driven Global Routing, </title> <type> Tech. Rep. </type> <institution> CSD-TR-920051, Computer Science Department, UCLA, </institution> <year> 1992. </year>
Reference-contexts: Cong et al. have proposed finding minimum spanning trees with bounded source-sink pathlength [5], i.e., by simultaneously minimizing both tree cost and the maximum source-sink pathlength (i.e., tree radius); a similar cost-radius tradeoff was achieved by <ref> [1] </ref>. More recently, Boese et al. [3] have developed a "critical sink" routing approach which significantly reduces delay to specified sinks, thereby exploiting the critical-path information that is implicitly available during iterative timing-driven layout. <p> Averages in each column are taken over the same 500 signal nets with pin locations chosen randomly from the layout region. Reported delays are all calculated using the Two-Pole simulator. Table 7 compares delays in Elmore-based LDTs with those of the MST and AHHK <ref> [1] </ref> constructions for nets with up to 17 pins under the IC2 technology. The AHHK algorithm, due to Alpert et al., is a recent cost-radius tradeoff construction which yields less tree cost (and signal delay) for given tree radius bounds when compared with the BRBC construction of Cong et al.[5].

Reference-contexts: For example, the Two-Pole simulator of Zhou et al. [21] considers the impedance in a routing tree in addition to the capacitance and resistance modeled by the Elmore formula. According to <ref> [2] </ref> and [21], the Two-Pole simulator is intermediate between SPICE and Elmore delay in both accuracy and speed of computation. 2 Because of its relatively simple form, Elmore delay can be calculated in O (k) time, as noted by Rubinstein et al. [18].

More recently, Boese et al. <ref> [3] </ref> have developed a "critical sink" routing approach which significantly reduces delay to specified sinks, thereby exploiting the critical-path information that is implicitly available during iterative timing-driven layout. The objective of our research is to identify and exploit a high-quality, algorithmically tractable model of interconnect delay. <p> Yet a third variation can be used to solve the simple, yet realistic case where exactly one critical sink n CS has been identified, i.e., ff CS = 1 and all other ff i = 0. The CSRT problem for one critical sink is studied in <ref> [3] </ref>. 3 required by SPICE will be too large. The linear delay approximation has been used in the past [5] [20], but is known to be inaccurate. <p> V = V [ fn j g 6. Output resulting spanning tree T = (V; E) trees. The LDT heuristic may be viewed as generalizing the Elmore Routing Tree algorithm of Boese, Kahng and Robins <ref> [3] </ref> to any given delay model. <p> For example, we may allow each newly selected pin to connect to an arbitrary point in an existing tree edge, possibly inducing a Steiner point. Simulation results in <ref> [3] </ref> indicate that the SLDT algorithm using Elmore delay is also highly effective. LDT can also be generalized to "critical-sink routing" (recall Footnote 1) by modifying the objective function in the LDT and SLDT algorithms to minimize delay at prescribed critical sinks [3]. <p> Simulation results in <ref> [3] </ref> indicate that the SLDT algorithm using Elmore delay is also highly effective. LDT can also be generalized to "critical-sink routing" (recall Footnote 1) by modifying the objective function in the LDT and SLDT algorithms to minimize delay at prescribed critical sinks [3]. Furthermore, our constructions can be adapted to minimize maximum tree delay, average tree delay (i.e., sum of delays to all the pins), or any other well-behaved delay function.

Reference-contexts: For a given signal net, the typical objective has been to minimize the maximum signal delay from the source pin to any sink pin.

Our studies indicate that algorithms which minimize the Elmore and Two-Pole estimators should also effectively minimize actual delay.

Reference-contexts: We can define a measure of fidelity by first ranking all tree topologies by the given delay model, ranking again by SPICE delay, and then finding the average difference between the two rankings for each topology. (An early theorem of Cayley <ref> [9] </ref> implies that there are jN j jNj2 distinct spanning tree topologies for any given net N ; see Figure 1 for the case jN j = 4.) We have run simulations to estimate this measure of fidelity for Elmore delay for nets of size 4 and 5 using each of

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Over the last several decades, advances in VLSI fabrication technology have steadily improved the packing density of integrated circuits. As feature sizes decrease, device switching speeds tend to increase; however, thinner wire has higher resistance, so that signal propagation delay through the interconnect increases <ref> [15] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: However, despite this pruning of the solution space, the worst-case time complexity of BBORT is exponential. In order to avoid the exponential running time of exhaustive enumeration, we propose the following greedy heuristic to approximate ORTs. Our method is an analogue of Prim's minimum spanning tree 8 construction <ref> [16] </ref>: starting with a trivial tree containing only the source, we iteratively find a pin n i in the tree and a sink n j outside the tree so that adding the edge e ij yields a tree with minimum delay.
