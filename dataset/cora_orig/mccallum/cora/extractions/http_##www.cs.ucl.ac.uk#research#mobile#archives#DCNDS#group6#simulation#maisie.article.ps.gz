Abstract: The Maisie simulation language was designed by enhancing C with a few primitives to create entities and to model events. An important construct of Maisie is the wait statement which allows a programmer to directly specify an event and its enabling condition. Appropriate use of the wait statement leads to succinct programs and reduces program development time. Maisie models may also be constructed visually using an interactive front-end. The sequential implementation provides an interactive trace facility to facilitate program debugging. An event monitoring facility is also provided to allow an analyst to identify the compute-intensive portions of the model. This paper provided a quick introduction to common language features.
