Abstract: Is there a single-valued NP function that, when given a satisfiable formula as input, outputs a satisfying assignment? That is, can a nondeterministic function cull just one satisfying assignment from a possibly exponentially large collection of assignments? We show that if there is such a nondeterministic function, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its second level. As the existence of such a function is known to be equivalent to the statement "every multivalued NP function has a single-valued NP refinement," our result provides the strongest evidence yet that multivalued NP functions cannot be refined. We prove our result via theorems of independent interest. We say that a set A is NPSV-selective (NPMV-selective) if there is a 2-ary partial function in NPSV (NPMV, respectively) that decides which of its inputs (if any) is "more likely" to belong to A; this is a nondeterministic analog of the recursion-theoretic notion of the semi-recursive sets and the extant complexity-theoretic notion of P-selectivity. Our hierarchy collapse follows by combining the easy observation that every set in NP is NPMV-selective with either of the following two theorems that we prove: (1) If A 2 NP is NPSV-selective, then A 2 (NP coNP)=poly. (2) If A 2 NP is NPSV-selective, then A is Low 2 . To wit, either result implies that if every set in NP is NPSV-selective, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its second level, NP NP .

Reference-contexts: Though it remains plausible that the polynomial hierarchy collapses relative to a random oracle, 10 the conventional wisdom is that the hierarchy does not collapse relative to a random oracle (see <ref> [Cai86] </ref> for some indication of the difficulties surrounding this issue). The main result of the present paper does not similarly imply that the polynomial hierarchy collapses relative to a random oracle, as Hypothesis 1.1 is known to fail relative to a random oracle [Roy93].

Reference-contexts: Fenner et al. <ref> [FHOS93] </ref> and Selman [Sel] raised a related question that, in light of the centrality of nondeterminism in complexity theory, may be equally compelling. They asked whether the following hypothesis is true. <p> Hypothesis 1.1 There is a single-valued NP function f such that for each formula F 2 SAT, f (F ) is a satisfying assignment of F . It is easy to see that Hypothesis 1.1 is true if NP = coNP. However, as both Fenner et al. <ref> [FHOS93] </ref> and Selman [Sel] suspected that Hypothesis 1.1 fails, perhaps a more interesting issue is that of the evidential weight in that direction. In fact, little is currently known to indicate that Hypothesis 1.1 fails.

Reference-contexts: Sets selective with respect to deterministic polynomial- time selector functions were introduced by Selman [Sel79], and are called the P-selective sets; sets selective with respect to single-valued total NP functions were introduced and studied by Hemachandra et al. <ref> [HHO + ] </ref>. There has been an explosion of interest in selective sets [BTvEB93,BvHT93,NOS93,HNOS93,HHO + ], and advances have catalyzed further advances. In this paper, we extend the notion of selectivity, in the natural way, to functions that 3 may be partial and/or multivalued. <p> This allows us to prove that the NPSV-selective sets in NP have lowness and advice class results just as strong as those shown by <ref> [HHO + ] </ref> for the NPSV t - selective sets in NP. This is an important advance, as results about NPSV t -selective sets offer no help in discrediting Hypothesis 1.1. 2 Definitions Our alphabet will be = f0; 1g. <p> For each k 3, define ExtendedLowfi k = fL j P ( p; L k1 )[O (log n)] P ( p; SATL k2 )[O (log n)] g. The [O (log n)] indicates that at most O (log n) queries are made to the oracle. 5 Hemachandra et al. <ref> [HHO + ] </ref> proved that NPSV t -sel (NP T coNP)=poly, that NPSV t - sel NP Low 2 , and that NPSV t -sel ExtendedLowfi 3 . Finally, we define "promise problems" [EY80] corresponding to selectivity. <p> It follows immediately by known results on the extended lowness <ref> [HHO + ] </ref> (respectively, lowness [Yap83]) of NP=poly T coNP=poly (respectively, NP=poly T coNP=poly T NP = coNP=poly T that NPMV t -sel is ExtendedLow 3 , and that NPMV t -sel T NP is Low 3 . We now turn to <br>- wards our main result.

Reference-contexts: mentioned|the NPSV-selective sets, the NPMV-selective sets, and the NPMV t -selective sets? Clearly, NPMV-sel (and thus NPSV-sel) is contained in NP=poly, and NPMV t -sel is contained in NP=poly T coNP=poly, via using a standard divide-and-conquer approach to find an appropriate advice set, similar to the approach in Ko's proof <ref> [Ko83] </ref> that the P-selective sets are in P=poly (see also the proofs of Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 3.5). <p> B n has at most n elements, and 3.

This is true, as in the case of Ko's proof that the P-selective sets are in P=poly <ref> [Ko83] </ref>, as we may repeatedly choose to add to B n some element of L =n that loses to (that is, proves less likely to be in L according to f ) at least half the elements that both are not yet in B n and don't yet beat some element

Reference-contexts: It was also (trivially) known that an assignment could be found via a polynomial-time machine using an NP oracle (and it was known, not trivially, that finding the lexicographically largest assignment was the hardest of all problems solvable in that class <ref> [Kre88] </ref>). But what about function classes between FP and FP NP ? In this paper, we proved that the NPSV functions are unlikely to have the power to find satisfying assignments; they can do so only if the polynomial hierarchy collapses to NP NP .

We now have implicitly proved our main result. Theorem 3.8 If Hypothesis 1.1 is true (equivalently, if every NPMV function has an NPSV refinement <ref> [Sel] </ref>), then NP NP = PH. Proof The reader may easily observe that every set in NP is NPMV-selective. It is not hard to see that any NPSV refinement of an NPMV-selector for a set is itself an NPSV-selector for the set. <p> This class is the class of (partial) functions computable via parallel (that is, truth-table) access to an NP oracle. Clearly, NPSV is a subset of this class (cf. <ref> [Sel] </ref>). The key open issue is distilled in the following hypothesis (see [WT93,AFW92,HNOS93,NOS93,Sel] for background and discussion). Hypothesis 5.1 Every NPMV function has a (single-valued) refinement in FP NP tt .
