Title: Desiderata for Agent Communication Languages  
Author: James Mayfield Yannis Labrou Tim Finin 
Address: Baltimore MD 21228-5398 USA  
Affiliation: Computer Science Department University of Maryland Baltimore County  
Abstract: This paper offers some opinions on the desirable features of languages and protocols for communication among intelligent information agents. These desiderata are divided into seven categories: form, content, semantics, implementation, networking, environment, and reliability. The Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML), is a new language and protocol for exchanging information and knowledge. This work is part of a larger effort, the ARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort, which is aimed at developing techniques and methodologies for building large-scale knowledge bases which are sharable and reusable. KQML is both a message format and a message-handling protocol to support run-time knowledge sharing among agents. KQML is described and evaluated as an agent communication language relative to the desiderata.

Reference-contexts: The Interlingua Group is developing a common language for expressing the content of a knowledge-base. This group has published a specification document describing the Knowledge Interchange Formalism or KIF <ref> (Genesereth & Fikes 1992) </ref>, which is based on first order logic with extensions to support non-monotonic reason and definitions. KIF provides both a specification for the syntax of a language, and a specification for its semantics.

Reference-contexts: The scope of the External Interfaces Group is the run-time interaction between knowledge-based systems and other modules. Special attention has been given to two important cases|communication between two knowledge-based systems and communication between a knowledge-based system and a conventional database management system <ref> (Pastor, McKay, & Finin 1992) </ref>. The KQML language is one of the main results to come out of the external interfaces group of the KSE. General information is available from http:- //www.cs.umbc.edu/kqml.
