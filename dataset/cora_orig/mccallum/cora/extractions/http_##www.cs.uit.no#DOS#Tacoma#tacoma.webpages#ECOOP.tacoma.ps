Title: Performance Issues in TACOMA

Abstract: Mobile code performance depends, in part, on the costs of transferring an agent from one host to another and of initiating execution of that agent on a target host. These costs are reported for TACOMA (Tromst and COrnell Moving Agents) v1.3, a UNIX-based system that supports agents. The experiments suggest opportunities for performance enhancements, both by changing the underlying operating system and by changing the architecture of the TACOMA run-time system.

Reference-contexts: TACOMA v1.3, used in these experiments, is the latest in a series of implementations. The system runs under most flavors of UNIX, and it supports agents implemented in C, Perl, Python, Scheme, and Tcl. Other agent systems, like Telescript [Whi94], Agent-Tcl <ref> [Gra95] </ref> and Messengers [LFB96], have similar architectures to TACOMA.

Reference-contexts: This paper describes detailed measurements of move and install operations for mobile code that is run using the TACOMA (Tromst and COrnell Moving Agents) system 3 . In TACOMA, a piece of mobile code is called an agent and is accompanied by state information in a briefcase <ref> [JvRS95] </ref>. By executing a meet operation, an agent initiates the installation and execution of code at another host. TACOMA v1.3, used in these experiments, is the latest in a series of implementations.
