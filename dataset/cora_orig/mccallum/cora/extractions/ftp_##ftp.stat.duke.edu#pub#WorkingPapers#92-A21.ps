Abstract: A variety of practical problems of finite population inference can be addressed in the framework of successive sampling discovery models population units are assumed drawn from a superpopulation distribution and then successively sampled according to a specified `size-biased' selection mechanism. Formal statistical analysis of discovery data under such models is technically challenging, as exemplified by the likelihood analyses of Nair and Wang (1989). Assessment of uncertainties about superpopulation parameters and, more critically, appropriate forms of predictive inference for the unsampled units in the finite population, are open issues that are addressed here from a Bayesian perspective. Motivated by the likelihood analysis of Nair and Wang (1989), we develop a formal Bayesian approach to analysis in the same class of models; we show how simulation methods provide for the computation of required posterior and predictive distributions of relevance. We further develop model extensions to cover problems of uncertainty about finite population sizes, uncertainty about sample selection mechanisms, and other practical issues. Several analyses of the oil reserve data of Nair and Wang (1989) are used for illustration.

Reference-contexts: Since r &gt; 0 the term e rw (y) is decreasing, so the modified density function for sampling the unobserved units concentrates on smaller values than does f (yj): As a result, the elements of U are a regular selection sample <ref> (Bayarri and DeGroot, 1987) </ref> drawn from the infinite population distribution but with selection probabilities proportional to e rw (y) : Technically, we still have the problem of simulating these selection samples.

Reference-contexts: assume the weighting of sampled units is log-linear with w (y) = e a 0 x for some specified pvector a of non-negative elements; thus w (y) is a weighted geometric mean of the elements of y: In this special model, conjugate priors for lie in the normal-inverse Wishart class <ref> (Press, 1985, section 7.1.6) </ref>. General results based on proper priors in this class are straightforward to derive. For benchmark analysis, the usual reference prior p () / jj (p+1)=2 is appropriate.
