Abstract: UPMAIL Technical Report No. 135 February 6, 1997 ISSN 1100-0686 fl The research of the first author was supported by a grant from the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences and by Uppsala University. The final version of this paper was written while first author was visiting Uppsala University. We would like to express our sincere thanks to Andrei Voronkov, Viggo Stoltenberg-Hansen and to all members of the Stockholm-Uppsala Mathematical Logical Seminar for their support, attention and generous hospitality.

Reference-contexts: Though several definitions were independently proposed, ( Godel, Church or Turing), they turned out to be equivalent. In the case of computability over reals the situation is essentially different from the classical one, since some nonequivalent notions have been proposed among others by Moschovakis [5], Blum <ref> [2] </ref>, Freedman [3] and Ershov [4]. This was apparently for the reasons that different authors took notice of different aspects of computational processes over reals.
