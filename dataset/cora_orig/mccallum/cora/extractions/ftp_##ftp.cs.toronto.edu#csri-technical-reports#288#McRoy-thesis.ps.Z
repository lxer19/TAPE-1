Reference-contexts: Transfer Rule|if the rule is applied in a forward direction, then all of an agent's beliefs about another agent's beliefs will be transferred, including a very large number that have nothing to do with the utterance, but if it is used backwards then it can apply to its own result <ref> (Appelt and Konolige 1988) </ref>. Appelt and Konolige propose a solution to some of these problems in another consistency-based approach, known as hierarchical autoepistemic logic. Epistemic approaches (Moore 1984; Moore 1985; Levesque 1989) cast default reasoning in terms of knowledge or belief instead of consistency. <p> As stated, this simple revision strategy is problematic because a speaker could convince him- or herself of something simply by uttering it; the solution is to give such default assumptions lower priority than default assumptions about the persistence of the speaker's prior beliefs <ref> (Appelt and Konolige 1988) </ref>. Another line of research involves specifying how best to maintain the consistency of a set of logical statements representing an agent's beliefs.

Reference-contexts: The latter are called `perlocutionary' effects. This three-way distinction was first made by Austin (1962), who also introduced the notion of treating utterances as actions. 2 This is a case of the qualification problem in artificial intelligence. 8 intention <ref> (Bach and Harnish 1979) </ref>. Whether the hearer actually adopts the speaker's belief might depend on the context and the hearer's other beliefs. Successful recognition of reflexive intentions, however, would not need to depend on one agent being able to convince another.

Reference-contexts: Determining when to act is the key issue. There is a tradeoff between acting at the first sign of trouble, and possibly disrupting the conversation unnecessarily, and acting only when the trouble becomes an impediment, and possibly creating a need for a larger and more difficult repair <ref> (see Carletta 1991) </ref>. Most previous work on misunderstanding takes the first approach, attempting to resolve ambiguities or apparent conceptual errors. 14 14 Conceptual errors correspond to believing of some false proposition that it is true. <p> Agents apparently try to somehow minimize their collective effort (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs 1986). They might also apply a fixed strategy of cautiousness or risk-taking, depending on the task <ref> (Carletta 1991) </ref>. Agents also balance goals of under 104 standing with social goals (such as not stirring up trouble) and hence sometimes choose not to repair an apparent misunderstanding explicitly.

Reference-contexts: bit, what we find is that whether or not it is psychologically plausible (or computationally worthwhile) for an agent to invest this sort of effort to avoid misunderstanding depends on the task the agent is performing, the medium of communication, and the relative costs associated with avoiding and repairing failures <ref> (Clark and Bren-nan 1991) </ref>. Agents apparently try to somehow minimize their collective effort (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs 1986). They might also apply a fixed strategy of cautiousness or risk-taking, depending on the task (Carletta 1991).

Reference-contexts: A number of correction strategies have been suggested: * Generalize a description by selectively ignoring some constraints (see Goodman 1985; McCoy 1985, 1986, 1988; Carberry 1988; Calistri-Yeh 1991; Eller and Car berry 1992), * Make a description more specific by adding extra constraints <ref> (see Eller and Car berry 1992) </ref>, and * Choose a conceptual "sibling", by combining generalization and constraint operations.

Reference-contexts: Logical omniscience is a particularly implausible quality for belief, because it attributes to agents the following powers <ref> (Fagin and Halpern, 1988) </ref>: * They believe all the implications of their beliefs. * They believe all tautologies. * If they believe ff, they also believe all formulae that are logically equivalent to ff. * If, for any ff, they believe both ff and :ff, then they believe every sentence in

Reference-contexts: preconditions to actions to identify a plan (i.e., a set of actions) that includes the observed act (see Allen and Perrault 1979; Sidner and Israel 1981; Litman 1986; Carberry 1985). 3 Here I use "plan-based" and "STRIPS-based" interchangeably to describe all systems that use a representation language similar to STRIPS <ref> (Fikes and Nilsson 1971) </ref> and NOAH (Sacerdoti 1977).

Reference-contexts: Foundational revision involves 113 adding justified (or self-evident) beliefs and removing any beliefs whose justifications are unsatisfactory. This approach thus requires one to maintain the complete sequence of justifications for each belief. Although in general this approach would be too memory-consuming to be what resource-limited human reasoners actually do <ref> (Gardenfors 1988) </ref>, for problems of limited size, programs known as truth maintenance systems can be used. One less resource-intensive alternative to foundational revision is what Harman (1986) calls coherence-theoretic belief revision.

Reference-contexts: More precisely, an action designator ff is a plan if one can prove from the theory that ff achieves the goal when executed in the initial state <ref> (Genesereth and Nilsson 1987) </ref>. The theory normally includes a plan library, that is, a collection of precomputed plans for achieving goals.

Reference-contexts: Following intentional accounts, the model will provide a mapping from the features of an utterance (e.g., words, prosody, syntax, and semantics) to a limited class of speech acts. 2 The model will also include a relation between speech acts and the linguistic intentions that they conventionally express <ref> (Grice 1957) </ref>. 3 For example, a suggestion 1 Conversation analysts attempt to describe discourse without such a theory, in the hope that they will be able to identify the features present in the dialogue accurately, without distorting or embellishing them. 2 In general, this mapping would also depend on the context

Reference-contexts: A more serious concern with the inferential approach is how to assess relevance in a particular context. However, these accounts offer almost no help in this regard. Most point to Gricean maxims for cooperative communication <ref> (see Grice 1975) </ref>, suggesting, for example, that speakers determine the relevance of an utterance by assuming that it is an act whose type is appropriate to the current stage of the exchange, that it is sincere, and that it provides the appropriate quantity and quality of information.

Reference-contexts: If either participant disagrees with the other's interpretation, they can challenge it. Alternatively, participants may accept an interpretation and respond with an utterance that shows their understanding and acceptance of it. In effect, speakers negotiate the meaning of utterances. This is illustrated by Example 1.2 <ref> (Gumperz, 1982) </ref> where the negotiation is made explicit. In this exchange, Husband intends T1 as a request for the location of the newspaper, whereas Wife takes it as a request to fetch the paper|even after being told that he just wants the information.

Reference-contexts: example, formulae such as the following are valid: Bel (X; ff) ^ Bel (X; ff fi) Bel (X; fi _ (ff ^ :ff)) In addition, it does not seem appropriate to say that an agent actively believes such inconsistencies; communication seems to depend on the following intuitions about human reasoning <ref> (Harman 1986, p. 11, emphasis added) </ref>: * The fact that one's view logically implies P can be a reason to accept P. * Logical inconsistency is to be avoided. Fagin and Halpern's (1985) theory of belief better preserves these intuitions, while still addressing the problem of logical omniscience. <p> Another line of research involves specifying how best to maintain the consistency of a set of logical statements representing an agent's beliefs. The foundational theory of belief revision assumes that any belief is either self-evident or has a non-circular, finite sequence of justifications made up of other beliefs <ref> (Harman 1986) </ref>. Foundational revision involves 113 adding justified (or self-evident) beliefs and removing any beliefs whose justifications are unsatisfactory. This approach thus requires one to maintain the complete sequence of justifications for each belief.

Reference-contexts: introduce a new supposition, typeWanted, where typeWanted (d 1 ; d 2 ) expresses that the referent of description d 2 is the desired referent of d 1 (which subsumes d 2 ); a less ad hoc approach would be to represent reference as an action in its own right <ref> (see Heeman and Hirst 1992) </ref>. <p> The examples also highlight some of the limitations of the present model: the need to incorporate belief revision; the need to relax the requirement that there be a one-to-one correspondence between speech acts and turns; the need to treat referring as an action <ref> (Heeman and Hirst 1992) </ref>; the need to incorporate additional types of repair (e.g., repetitions to repair mishearing); and the need to allow for strategic uses of repair. 102 Chapter 8 Possible extensions to the model In this chapter, we consider some important issues that have not been not addressed by this

Reference-contexts: According to this approach, there are conversational rules that specify an expected range of responses to every action, giving speakers a guide to possible interpretations. These rules do not depend on the psychological characteristics of particular participants; that is, they are independent of speakers' various desires and motivations <ref> (see Heritage 1984, pp. 1-2) </ref>. In addition, the STRIPS-based models of discourse that have been proposed have not given us a well-defined theory of dialogue.

Reference-contexts: According to these accounts, beliefs are those conclusions that can be derived if given 110 a theory, a set of inference rules, and a control strategy. Limited reasoning is captured either through a logically incomplete set of inference rules <ref> (Konolige 1986a) </ref> or through a limited control strategy (van Arragon 1990). For example, Konolige prevents logical omniscience by defining a deduction rule that is similar to modus ponens, but places a bound on the number of steps in a derivation.

Reference-contexts: Although awareness can be defined so that it prevents logical omniscience, being syntactic, the account suffers from the same problem of over-sensitivity to the form of the formulae that plagued previous syntactic accounts of belief <ref> (Konolige 1986b) </ref>. There is also a difficulty associated with defining an appropriate awareness function for an application; for discourse modeling, we would need one that is task-dependent. A third set of approaches to belief that we shall consider are the deductive ones.

Following accounts of other actions, for each act of introspection the theory would specify the steps of its possible decompositions into more primitive mental operations, any constraints on their application, and the (conditional) effects of the act.

Reference-contexts: Misunderstandings normally involve either problems of reference or problems of relevance (Remler 1978; Schegloff 1987). Reference problems are those in which the discourse participants have a different understanding of the identity of an object or idea mentioned in the discourse, as in the following exchange <ref> (from Remler 1978, p. 392) </ref>, where agent B is mistaken about which dress A is talking about: Example 2.1 `I like that dress' T1 A: I really like that dress.

That is, speech acts and discourse plans are specified by a header that names an action (and functions as a frame type) and a specification of the preconditions, effects, and steps in the decomposition for an act of the given type (typically represented as slots).

Reference-contexts: T3 A: Oh. Yours is nice too, but I was talking about the one L has on. T4 B: Oh. I thought you meant mine. Relevance problems are those in which the participants have a different understanding of the relationship between actions or objects. In Example 2.2 <ref> (from Schegloff 1987, p. 208) </ref>, two sisters are talking on the telephone, and one sister (A) misunderstands an attempt by the other (B) to initiate a closing in T1, taking it instead as a complaint and hence requiring her to offer an excuse in T4. <p> If a conversant hears an utterance that seems inconsistent with her expectations (perhaps because she has misunderstood some previous utterance) and the inconsistency leads her to reinterpret an earlier utterance and produce a new response to it, this is a fourth-turn (or fourth-position) repair <ref> (Schegloff 1987) </ref>. Such repairs not only display the alternative interpretations, but also indicate some of the information that may underlie a participant's decision to favor one of them over another. Consider the fragment of conversation shown in Example 2.6 (Terasaki 1976).

Reference-contexts: After a speaker detects a misunderstanding by either participant, she may initiate a repair. Conversation analysts have identified three important types of discourse-level repair, distinguished by the number of turns between the misunderstood turn and the start of the repair <ref> (Schegloff 1992) </ref>. The most common type is second-turn (or next-turn) repair. These repairs occur immediately after the misunderstood turn, before the hearer has produced any other reply to it, as in the following example: Example 2.4 Second-turn repair T1 B: Do you know where Mr. <p> Although there is a preference for repairing one's own misunderstandings (Schegloff, Jefferson and Sacks 1977), these repairs are deprecated because the number of potential targets for the repair increases with each intervening exchange, making locating the target increasingly difficult <ref> (Schegloff 1992) </ref>. If a conversant hears an utterance that seems inconsistent with her expectations (perhaps because she has misunderstood some previous utterance) and the inconsistency leads her to reinterpret an earlier utterance and produce a new response to it, this is a fourth-turn (or fourth-position) repair (Schegloff 1987).

Reference-contexts: For example, he might restate his intended goal or explicitly tell the speaker that she has misunderstood. Alternatively, the hearer might choose not to make the misunderstanding public, because certain forms of third-turn repairs can easily be mistaken for a challenge <ref> (Schegloff, Jefferson and Sacks 1977) </ref>. After a speaker detects a misunderstanding by either participant, she may initiate a repair. Conversation analysts have identified three important types of discourse-level repair, distinguished by the number of turns between the misunderstood turn and the start of the repair (Schegloff 1992). <p> A could have also told B the intended goal (e.g., "No, I want you to tell me.") The least-favored type of repair involves producing a new reply to a turn that one has apparently misunderstood. Although there is a preference for repairing one's own misunderstandings <ref> (Schegloff, Jefferson and Sacks 1977) </ref>, these repairs are deprecated because the number of potential targets for the repair increases with each intervening exchange, making locating the target increasingly difficult (Schegloff 1992). <p> Russ recovers by generating a fourth-turn repair; he reinterprets T1 as an indirect request and producing T4 as an attempt to satisfy it. This example also demonstrates agents' reluctance to repair the problems in the utterances of others <ref> (Schegloff, Jefferson and Sacks 1977) </ref>; although Mother might have produced an explicit third-turn repair at T3 (e.g., "No, I'm asking you."), the manifestation of a misunderstanding provided her with an expectable option that allowed her to avoid doing so.

Reference-contexts: A speaker may produce a reply that is out of this range <ref> (Schegloff and Sacks 1973) </ref>; however, that speaker can expect that the producer of the first part will try to infer an explanation.

Reference-contexts: Thus, if a speaker decides to produce a reply that she knows will be outside the expected range, she might use a discourse marker such as "well" to acknowledge the deviance of the response and to avoid appearing to have misunderstood <ref> (Schiffrin 1987) </ref>. Within an adjacency pair, the typology of units is very similar to the illocutionary acts proposed by speech-act theorists. But, it is considered an important feature of Conversation Analysis that these utterances are classified without reference (by the analyst) to such unobservable features as the speaker's intention.

Reference-contexts: According to Grice, a speaker might intend for the hearer to adopt certain beliefs or intentions or perform certain actions. However, Grice's account runs into trouble at this point, because a hearer may fail to adopt the beliefs that a speaker expresses, even after recognizing the speaker's intention <ref> (Searle 1969) </ref>. Searle (1969) argues that a better way to define speech acts would be to provide, for each act, a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for its (literal, nondefective) performance. Such conditions would need to hold in order for an utterance of the act to be considered appropriate.

Reference-contexts: Whether or not one agrees that this restriction is desirable (or possible), an illocutionary level of description is necessary for an expectation-based account, because social norms depend on behaviors that can be sanctioned, observed, and verified <ref> (Shimanoff 1980) </ref>. Where Conversation Analysis is weakest is in its explanation of how the recipient of an utterance is able to understand it if there is no pre-existing expectation (i.e., no incomplete adjacency pair).

Reference-contexts: Such repairs not only display the alternative interpretations, but also indicate some of the information that may underlie a participant's decision to favor one of them over another. Consider the fragment of conversation shown in Example 2.6 <ref> (Terasaki 1976) </ref>. Example 2.6 Fourth-turn repair T1 Mother: Do you know who's going to that meeting? T2 Russ: Who? T3 Mother: I don't know. T4 Russ: Oh. Probably Mrs. McOwen and probably Mrs. Cadry and some of the teachers.

Reference-contexts: Thus, it has not been necessary to represent mutual beliefs in order to account for the negotiation of understanding by discourse agents to handle this class of misunderstanding <ref> (cf. Thomason 1990) </ref>. 9.2 Directions for future work This research provides some steps toward a unified account of interpretation, generation, and repair. There are a number of important directions in which it could be expanded: 1.

Reference-contexts: Actions that are used to challenge display non-acceptance of the presuppositions of previous action (i.e., they address misconception or mishearing as opposed to misunderstanding) <ref> (Tsui 1991) </ref>. Actions that are used to initiate repair display non-acceptance of an interpretation. Lastly, when speakers have no other goals to achieve nor expectations to address, they may attempt to close the conversation. <p> A listener might deem a speaker's actions unacceptable if he disagrees with the attitudes that they presuppose of either participant. In addition to semantic sources, such attributions might derive from linguistic intentions or from more general presuppositions of need, authority, social status, etc. Consider Example 3.1 <ref> (from Tsui 1991) </ref>. In this example, C challenges the presupposition that he heard and understood in T1. D then responds in T3 by repeating the challenged phrase and attempting to clarify its meaning. Example 3.1 `Love Story' T1 D: Why, sad novels can be fun to read. <p> By some accounts, such questions are taken to presuppose that the hearer does know the answer and hence a response to the contrary could be considered a challenge of the presupposition <ref> (Tsui 1991) </ref>(see Section 3.2). 67 These rules are useful for identifying the speech acts that speakers might use to achieve their goals in a given situation.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, ambiguities that originate during sentence processing might not become apparent until they create an inconsistency at the discourse level.

The symptoms of misconception include references to entities that do not map to previously known objects or operations <ref> (Webber and Mays 1983) </ref> or requests for clarification (Moore 1989). Errors are corrected by replacing or deleting parts of the problematic utterance so that it makes sense.
