Abstract: We consider assembling documents using, as a source, a digital library containing SGML documents. The assembly process contains two parts: 1) tnding interesting fragments, and 2) constructing a coherent document. We present a general document assembly framework. First, we describe a system for tailoring control engineering textbooks. Its assembling facilities are rather restricted but, on the other hand, the quality of documents produced is high. Second, we address the problem of tltering and combining interesting information from a large heterogeneous document collection. The methods presented oer various ways to tnd the interesting document fragments. Moreover, the elements found in the fragments are mapped to generic elements, like sections, paragraph containers, paragraphs and strings, which have known semantics. Hence, even arbitrary compositions can be formatted and printed.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In an on-going research and development project called Structured and Intelligent Documents (SID) <ref> [1] </ref> we study document assembly in its dierent aspects. By document assembly we mean computer-aided construction of a new document using several existing document sources.

Reference-contexts: Hence, Paragraphs and Paragraph containers located between two Sections in the fragment list have to be combined by generating a new Section. If the generated new Section is too large, the Paragraphs may be joined in order to get several smaller Sections <ref> [2] </ref>. Additionally, the desired number of top-level Sections can be given as a parameter. If the number of Sections and generated Sections exceeds this threshold, some consecutive Sections have to combined.

Reference-contexts: For instance, within our control engineering library, the user might want to create a collection of exercises for college students majoring in data communications. The second way is based on the Scatter/Gather clustering <ref> [4] </ref>. The user-controlled iterative clustering process forms a classitcation of the material, and gives the user an extracted view of the documents. This is especially invaluable when the user is dealing with an unfamiliar collection of documents; traditional query models do not help the user to achieve a simple overview.

Reference-contexts: We claim that dynamic compositions are needed, and to achieve this, we have decided to use Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) [6] for the management of the material. Haake et al. have introduced the Individualized Electronic Newspaper <ref> [5] </ref> which also uses SGML as the document presentation format. Their approach, although somewhat similar to ours, concentrates on gathering and presenting news-like material according to readers' protles while our goal is more general: a coherent assembled customized SGML document. SGML is a metalanguage for detning document structures.

Reference-contexts: The major hierarchical structure elements of a book are chapters, sections, subsections and paragraphs. We have used as a basis for our document type detnition the Book DTD of the ISO 12083 standard <ref> [7] </ref> extended with element types for exercises, answers, examples, formulas, detnitions and clauses. The book is enriched with internal supplementary information. Manual seeding, based on information from the authors, was necessary to classify the fragments of the material into appropriate categories.
