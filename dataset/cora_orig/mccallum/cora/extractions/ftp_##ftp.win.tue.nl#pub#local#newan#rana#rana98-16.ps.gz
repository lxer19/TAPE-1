Reference-contexts: + x 3 (8) where OE (x 1 ) = m 1 x 1 + 2 This system is known to have a so called double scroll chaotic attractor for ff = 15:6, m 0 = 8 7 , m 1 = 5 and 23 &lt; &lt; 31 (see e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>). We assume that y = x 2 is the transmitted signal. Note that with this choice of y we have that the relative degree of y with respect to equals 2.

Reference-contexts: It may be argued that from a practical point of view this is not a serious objection, since in practice one will have (8) "running" when communicating. However, as was shown in e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>, the system (8) for the given parameter values is chaotic in the sense of Shil'nikov. This implies in particular that the origin is a homiclinic point for (8), which gives by the above that e will also not tend to zero when (8) is initialized on the homoclinic orbit.

Reference-contexts: Two particularly interesting ideas which have emerged during this time are (chaos) synchronization and chaos control. Recent reviews on these subjects can be found in, for instance, two special issues devoted to the subject, see <ref> [4] </ref>,[14] (where in fact [4] is a follow up of an earlier special issue on the same subject of the same journal ([3])). Synchronization and controlled synchronization of complex/chaotic systems is a topic that has become popular because of its possible use in secure communication, see [12],[11].

Observe that we have that ~y (t) = ~w 0 (t) + ~w 1 (t) ! y (t) (t ! +1). <p> w (t))w 1 (t) is persistingly exciting, which means that there should exist ff 1 ; ff 2 ; ffi &gt; 0 such that for all t 0 we have ff 1 t From the above analysis, the estimator obtained in <ref> [5] </ref> may also be derived (although the derivation in [5] is somewhat different). Observe that we have that ~y (t) = ~w 0 (t) + ~w 1 (t) ! y (t) (t ! +1).

It seems that in [5] the authors do not need ~w 1 to be persistingly exciting. <p> These conditions are fulfilled if ~w 1 is persistingly exciting. A disadvantage of the estimator ~ when compared to ^ is that ~ will behave badly at zero-crossings of ~w 1 (t). In <ref> [5] </ref>, the authors cope with this problem by adding an extra filter, which finally results in a dynamic update law for ~ of the form _ ~ = g sign ( ~w 1 ) 1+j ~w 1 j ( ~w 0 + ~w 1 ~ y) = sign ( ~w 1 <p> This leads to the conclusion that the scheme proposed in <ref> [5] </ref> may be interpreted as a scheme based on (linear) system identification methods.

In this section, we started with a partially synchronizing subsystem (11) rather than a completely synchronizing subsystem as in <ref> [5] </ref>. However, there is also another (generalized) synchronization aspect present in the scheme. <p> We therefore propose an adaptive identification scheme that would enable the message reconstruction without explicitly assuming (partial) synchronization. This method forms a generalization of a method developed in <ref> [5] </ref> and is applicable in a far more general setting than [5]. It should be noted that the message to be reconstructed has to be slowly time-varying, so that the identification is fast enough for the reconstruction. <p> We therefore propose an adaptive identification scheme that would enable the message reconstruction without explicitly assuming (partial) synchronization.

Reference-contexts: Note further that, although it has been shown experimentally that the (x 1 ; x 3 )-subsystem syn chronizes with the system ae _ ^x 3 = x 2 (see e.g. <ref> [6] </ref>), the Corron-Hahs scheme cannot be applied directly, since the synchronizing system depends explicitly on the unknown parameter . In order to come up with a a reconstruction scheme for , we employ the following strategy. <p> It may then be shown that still can be reconstructed, provided ^x 1 (t) approaches x 1 (t) sufficiently fast. In <ref> [6] </ref>, it was shown experimentally that this will indeed be the case for constant . However, one needs to be somewhat careful here for the following reasons. Define the error signal e (t) := ^x 1 (t) x 1 (t).

Reference-contexts: In the problem of system inversion, the task is to find an (asymptotic) inverse of this mapping. This approach will be pursued in future research (note, however, that this idea has also been pursued in <ref> [7] </ref>). The second approach, that will be pursued in this paper, is that of system identification. In system identification, the task is to estimate unknown (possibly slowly time-varying) parameters of a system, based on measurements taken from the system.

Reference-contexts: Note that the "distance" between the message and the transmitted signal is quite small, in the sense that already the first time-derivative of the transmitted signal along solutions of (2) explicitly depends on (in control theoretic terms, this expressed by saying that the relative degree (cf. <ref> [8] </ref>) of x 1 with respect to equals one). However, intuitively, one would say that in order to have secure communication, a high relative degree is required, since a high "distance" between the message and the transmitted signal should give a better masking of the message.

Reference-contexts: However, using control theoretic ideas, it is possible to reconstruct based on the measurement y. A first step in this reconstruction is the observation that (13) may be transformed into a system with so called linearizable error dynamics (see e.g. <ref> [10] </ref>). More specifically, note that, since x 3 (0) &gt; 0, we have that x 3 (t) &gt; 0 (8t 0). Thus, for (13) the coordinate change 1 = x 1 , 2 = x 2 , ~y = 3 = log x 3 is well-defined.

Reference-contexts: Note that for this system we have that the relative degree of y with respect to equals 3. Further, it is known (see e.g. <ref> [12] </ref>) that for (13) the (x 1 ; x 2 )-subsystem does not synchronize with the system ae _ ^x 2 = ^x 1 + ^x 2 Thus, in this case the Corron-Hahs approach breaks down completely.

Reference-contexts: In system identification, the task is to estimate unknown (possibly slowly time-varying) parameters of a system, based on measurements taken from the system. For linear systems, system identification is well-established (for an overview, see e.g. <ref> [13] </ref>). In this paper, it will be shown on two examples that this identification may be helpful in communication us ing chaotic systems. Although both examples concern chaotic, and thus nonlinear, systems, it is possible to use the standard "linear" identification algorithms once the systems are decomposed properly. <p> We next briefly indicate how one would go about to obtain a reconstruction scheme for the system (2) by employing methods from identification theory as described in e.g. <ref> [13] </ref>. <p> We then obtain: ^y y = ^y ~y + (~y y) = = (~y y) + ( ^ )w 1 = *(t) + ( ^ )w 1 where *(t) = ~y (t) y (t). It may then be shown (see <ref> [13] </ref> for details) that with an update law for of the form _ ^ = g (t; w)(^y y); g &gt; 0 (7) we will have that ^ (t) ! (t ! 1) provided (t; w (t)) is bounded, (t; w (t))w 1 (t) 0 (8t), and the signal (t; w <p> Note that, when we compare the last two equations in (10) with (7), we see that we have (t; w) = w 01 p (t). This estimation scheme is called the least squares estimator with exponential forgetting factor (cf. <ref> [13] </ref>). Thus, if x 1 could be measured, the reconstruction of could be achieved by employ-ing the scheme (10).
