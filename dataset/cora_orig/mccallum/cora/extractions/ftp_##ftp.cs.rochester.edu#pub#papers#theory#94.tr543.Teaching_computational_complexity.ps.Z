Reference-contexts: Ambos-Spies, S. Homer, and U. Schoning, Cambridge University Press, 1993 <ref> [AHS93] </ref>. This collection is quite different from the two just discussed. The papers in this collection are technical articles attempting not just to review but to extend the state-of-the-art on their particular topics. Thus, they are substantially more demanding.

While writing this, I had only a subset of the chapters of Yap's soon-to-appear text [Yap], so it is not discussed here.

Reference-contexts: Exquisite. 5 * Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness, M. Garey and D. Johnson, W. H. Freeman and Company, 1979 <ref> [GJ79] </ref>. This is one of the very few theoretical computer science books so accessible that one can just sit down and enjoyably read it as one would a novel.

Associative Storage Modification Machines Other Collections Johnson's [Joh90] excellent|though of course not exhaustive|"catalog" of complexity classes can be found in the Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science <ref> [vL90] </ref>. Johnson provides an enjoyable romp through a wide range of complexity classes, though his article's goal and space limitations understandably prevent him from providing a detailed review of the results known for the classes (if he had, he would have had a very thick book !).

Reference-contexts: He does state Toda's Theorem (PH P PP ) but doesn't give a proof; rather, he proves the key result of Valiant and Vazirani <ref> [VV86] </ref> that in part underpins Toda's result. Downward separation is covered (though not by name), but upward separation is not. None of these comments should be taken as a criticism; given the (already 500-page-plus) length of his book, the particular set of theorems included is excellent.

Reference-contexts: Wagner and G. Wechsung, D. Reidel Publishing Company 1986 <ref> [WW86] </ref>. This book has a powerful up-side and also a bit of a down-side. On the down-side, the notation is quite unusual and tough to follow.
