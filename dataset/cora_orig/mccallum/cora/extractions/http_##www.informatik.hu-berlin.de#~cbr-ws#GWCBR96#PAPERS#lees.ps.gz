Title: Case-Based Reasoning in a Safety Critical Systems Integrated Development Environment

Abstract: Progress is described in an ongoing project, the aim of which is to provide an integrated environment to support the design of safety critical systems. Central to the research is the development and use of an electronic analogy of a designers journal, to enable design traceability through the capture and later recall and replay of sequences of design actions. An important aim is to facilitate the production of high quality designs through the reuse of previously proven designs; for this, the application of case-based reasoning is considered to be appropriate. Proposals for the enhancement of the environment, through the provision of case-based design support, are discussed.

Reference-contexts: One interesting approach to redesign is based on techniques derived from model-based diagnosis research <ref> (Bakker et al., 1994) </ref>. In this approach, redesign is determined by the inputs and outputs of the task, the inputs being the old design description and new specification, and the output being the new design description.

Reference-contexts: Page Content Descriptors are the means of retrieving stored pages.

Artificial Intelligence Support Design is an interesting area of problem solving in which to investigate the application of artificial intelligence (AI) methodology <ref> (Brown & Chandrasekaran, 1989) </ref>. The aim in applying AI methods may be to provide support by advising the designer in the design of a new product, given its functional specification; or to trace the actions and decisions made by the designer. <p> An alternative strategy is to employ a generic task model <ref> (Brown and Chandrasekaran, 1989) </ref> as a strategy for the redesign of an object - an approach that has been applied by Brazier et al.

Reference-contexts: In the logical model of the system containing the set of interacting agents, the agents communicate via a form of blackboard structure <ref> (Hallam, 1990) </ref> as shown in Figure 2. 4. Case-Based Reasoning Support The development of safety critical software can benefit from the reuse of software modules that have been previously validated and have proven quality and reliability.

Reference-contexts: Although the objective is to support the demanding requirements of safety critical systems design, the approach is also applicable to other areas of engineering or software design. The SCIDS approach provides an environment to support the traceability of the designer's actions in creating conceptual designs <ref> (Lees and Jenkins, 1995) </ref>. SCIDS aims to enable the capture of design intent and safety arguments, from the earliest stages of design, in order to enable early evaluation and analysis of design options, and to facilitate the reuse of designs (Jenkins, 1994). 2. <p> The ODJ also acts as a reminder, bringing to the designer's attention when safety or other important constraints are violated. Playing back a sequence of recorded protocol allows a study how a design object was constructed <ref> (Jenkins, 1995) </ref>. 2.1 System Architecture The ODJ forms a shell, between the user and the design application tool which is currently being used. The overall architecture is shown in Figure 1. The role of the Protocol Manager is to intercept all interactions between the designer and the application tool. <p> The area of application of the design support environment is, in a parallel ongoing project, being extended to that of computersupported cooperative design <ref> (Jenkins, 1995) </ref>. The application of agents to computer supported cooperative work is well recognised. In future work it is intended to investigate to what extent the use of intelligent agents may be able to provide support for cooperative design.

Reference-contexts: Case-Based Reasoning Support The development of safety critical software can benefit from the reuse of software modules that have been previously validated and have proven quality and reliability. This suggests a case-based approach <ref> (Riesbeck and Schank, 1991) </ref> which would employ an intelligent agent whose task is to match information held in the page content descriptors, and possibly also in the requirements specification of the current design, with corresponding items of previous designs.

Reference-contexts: It should be appreciated that the retrieval of a case that most closely matches the requirements of the current situation may not always be the best indicator of reusability <ref> (Smyth and Keane, 1994) </ref>. An estimation of the ease by which a design can be reused is not necessarily provided just by matching the current case with previous cases. It may be preferable to follow a strategy of retrieving cases which require minimal adaptation, to meet current requirements. 5.

Reference-contexts: decomposition of the desired product, and so it is desirable to provide the means of identifying, and of advising the designer, when the reuse of previously proven components is appropriate. 4.1 Design Reuse The practical application of the concept of the reuse of previous designs poses a number of questions <ref> (Wognum, 1994) </ref>: How can the most appropriate previously stored design be located? Can any prediction be made about the effects of the changes in a modified design? What information is required to find relevant similar designs? How should past design knowledge be organised and stored to make it amenable for later

Reference-contexts: Rather than attempting to incorporate all the necessary functions within a large, complex inference mechanism, a better model would appear to be a framework within which a collection of autonomous intelligent agents are concurrently active <ref> (Wooldridge and Jennings, 1993) </ref>. It is also believed that symbolic artificial intelligence, in itself, would not be the most effective method of providing the required support, and that a combination of both symbolic and connectionist approaches would be better.
