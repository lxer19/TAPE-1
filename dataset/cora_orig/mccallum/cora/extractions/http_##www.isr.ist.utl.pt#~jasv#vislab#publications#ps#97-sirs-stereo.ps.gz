Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of robustly estimating correspondences between stereo images, together with the computation of the Fundamental Matrix - F . The fundamental matrix describes the epipolar geometry of a pair of stereo images, and a number of algorithms have been described in the literature to estimate this matrix. However, most of these algorithms assume that a number of correct point correspondences has been established a priori, which is hardly ever the case in practice. In the paper, we focus on the joint estimation of point correspondences and F , in the practical situation where a number of points may correspond to erroneous matches. We compare various methods for the estimation of the fundamental matrix using a robust procedure to select good point correspondences from a larger data set. A new algorithm based on the Least Median of Squares is presented. It compares favourably to various existing ones, both in accuracy and computational effort. The robust estimation of F and point correspondences is a determinant step for numerous applications like 3D reconstruction and video mosaicing, that are discussed in the paper.

Reference-contexts: Since the space of the possible estimates for the fundamental matrix is too large, it is common practice to constrain the analysis to a randomly sampled subspace.

We will now propose a variant to LMedS - MEDSERE 2 using case deletion and random sampling, with the following algorithm : 1. Randomly sample the complete set of matched points S total for a set of 8 pairs. 2.

Reference-contexts: One of the main problems on the estimation is the fact that the fundamental matrix can be very sensitive to error on the point locations. Much effort has been taken on the study of the fundamental matrix over the last few years <ref> [10, 9, 4] </ref>. Several algorithms have been proposed which try to minimise the problems due to errors on the point locations and mismatches. Any automated stereo system which is not robust to this kind of errors is doomed to fail on real world applications. <p> The epipolar lines depend both on the cameras intrinsic parameters and on the relative orientation and position between both view points. Thus, recovering the epipolar constraints is of the utmost importance for stereo matching and reconstruction. In projective coordinates, the epipolar constraint <ref> [4] </ref> can be written as : u 0T F u = 0 (1) where fu; u 0 g are the projective coordinates of two corresponding points in the two images and F is a (3x3) matrix, defined up to a scale factor, known as the Fundamental matrix [9]. <p> For a more complete survey on robust methods, refer to [11] and [13]. 4 Uncalibrated Reconstruction We will now consider the problem of uncalibrated reconstruction.

It is known <ref> [3, 4] </ref> that if the cameras intrinsic parameters information is available, then it becomes possible to determine the camera placements from the fundamental matrix, and thus achieve Euclidean reconstruction.

Reference-contexts: In each iteration we discard the correspondence pair that correspond to the largest distance to the epipolar line. The Random Sampling Consensus (RANSAC) paradigm was introduced in the Computer Vision literature in 1981 by Fischler and Bolles <ref> [5] </ref>. The main idea is to find a significant set of data points consistent with an instantiation of the followed model, i. e., to find a consensus group. The remaining data points are rejected as outliers. The RANSAC algorithm is best illustrated by the following steps : 1.

Reference-contexts: Let us consider a generic camera projection matrix P = (M j M T ), where M is the 3x3 matrix on the left side of P , and T is a 3x1 vector. If the camera is not placed at the infinity then M is invertible <ref> [6] </ref>. The vector T contains the 3D coordinates of the camera centre expressed on the world coordinate system. Therefore it is straightforward to determine the camera centre from P , if the camera is not placed at infinity. <p> If only finite camera locations are considered then M fl 2 . For more details refer to <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> The problem remaining to be solved is to determine a pair of camera projection matrices agreeing with the estimated F . We will now present a lemma which can be used directly to obtain such pair. 4.1 Recovering the projection matrices from F In <ref> [6, 7] </ref> a method is presented to recover two projection matrices in accordance to an estimated fundamental matrix, F . <p> A simpler version of this lemma, on which this was based, is presented in <ref> [6] </ref> where M is a rotation matrix, hence simplifying the derivation process. A number of tests were conducted, using the reconstruction procedure on synthetic and real data. The synthetic data consists of a set of 3D points that are projected on two images given a pair of camera projection matrices.

Reference-contexts: The solution vector, f , is the null space of the columns of A. In real-world applications, eight matched points will not suffice, as the resulting matrix F is bound to have large errors, due to inaccuracies on the point locations <ref> [9, 7] </ref>. Using more than eight point leads to an over-determined set of equations which can be formulated as the classical minimisation problem min k Af k constrained to k f k= 1 (3) The solution to this problem is the eigenvector associated with the smallest singular value of A. <p> The main drawback is that it is extremely sensitive to noise. Except for very accurate point locations, the F matrix will not have rank two. Since most applications rely on this property, one has to force the rank constraint afterwards. A simple way to do this <ref> [7] </ref>, is to replace F by the rank deficient matrix F 0 , which minimises the Frobenius distance. The F matrix can be easily computed by zeroing the smallest singular value of the SVD decomposition of F , as suggested in [15]. <p> On fundamental matrix estimation procedures, the coordinate origin is often placed on the top- left corner of the image. This does not promote coordinate homogeneity, and affects the condition of the system matrix A. A simple procedure of coordinate transformation is presented in <ref> [7] </ref> which performs coordinate translation and scaling. By moving the origin to the point mass centre on both images, and by scaling the axes so to have unitary standard deviation, one can improve the problem condition and stability. <p> The problem remaining to be solved is to determine a pair of camera projection matrices agreeing with the estimated F . We will now present a lemma which can be used directly to obtain such pair. 4.1 Recovering the projection matrices from F In <ref> [6, 7] </ref> a method is presented to recover two projection matrices in accordance to an estimated fundamental matrix, F .

Reference-contexts: This paradigm, as originally proposed, requires the specification of three parameters: the error tolerance used to discard data points; the number of subsets to test and the threshold d T .

Reference-contexts: An estimation problem arises from the fact that outliers can make degenerate data appear non-degenerate thus producing a wrong fundamental matrix. The problem of degeneracy will not be considered here. For robust detection of degenerate configurations refer to <ref> [14] </ref>. In Section 4 we tackle the problem of retrieving the cameras projection matrices from an estimated fundamental matrix. In this section we generalize to some extent the work of Hartley, by considering general projection matrices which include all the intrinsic parameters.

Reference-contexts: A simple way to do this [7], is to replace F by the rank deficient matrix F 0 , which minimises the Frobenius distance. The F matrix can be easily computed by zeroing the smallest singular value of the SVD decomposition of F , as suggested in <ref> [15] </ref>. Care has to be taken when enforcing this constraint.
