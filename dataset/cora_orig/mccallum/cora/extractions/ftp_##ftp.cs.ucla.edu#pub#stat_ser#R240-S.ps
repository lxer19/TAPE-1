Title: Axioms of Causal Relevance  
Author: David Galles and Judea Pearl 
Address: Los Angeles, CA 90024  
Affiliation: Cognitive Systems Laboratory Computer Science Department University of California,  
Abstract: This paper develops a set of graphoid-like axioms for causal relevance, that is, statements of the form: "Changing X will not affect Y if we hold Z constant". Both a probabilistic and deterministic definition of causal irrelevance are proposed. The probabilistic definition allows for only two axioms, unless stability is assumed. Under the stability assumption, probabilistic causal irrelevance is equivalent to path interception in cyclic graphs. The deterministic definition allows for all of the axioms of path interception in cyclic graphs, with the exception of transitivity.

Reference-contexts: Introduction In <ref> (Geiger, Verma, & Pearl 1990) </ref>, a set of axioms was developed for a class of relations called graphoids. These axioms characterize informational relevance among observed events based on the semantics of conditional independence in probability calculus. <p> Once we hold Z fixed (at z), changing X will not affect the probability of Y .) If we remove the "hat" from the definition above, we get the standard definition of conditional independence in probability calculus, denoted I (X; Z; Y ), which are governed by the graphoid axioms <ref> (Geiger, Verma, & Pearl 1990) </ref> below. 1.1 (Symmetry) I (X; Z; Y ) =) I (Y; Z; X) 1.2 (Decomposition) I (X; Z; Y W ) =) I (X; Z; Y ) 1.3 (Weak union) I (X; Z; Y W ) =) I (X; ZW; Y ) 1.4 (Contraction) I (X;

Reference-contexts: Note that reversibility does not hold in Lewis' closest-world framework <ref> (Lewis 1973) </ref>. Y = y may hold in all closest w-worlds, W = w may hold in all closest y-worlds and, still, Y = y may not hold in our world.

Reference-contexts: We can define a stability condition, similar to <ref> (Pearl & Verma 1991) </ref>, as follows: Definition 4 (Stability) Let T be a causal theory, G (T ) be the directed graph described by T , and CI (T ) represent all probabilistic causal irrelevances in T .

Reference-contexts: Consider all values u such that Y x (u) = y and Z x (u) = z. Clearly, for any of these u's, Y xz (u) = y, since Z is being held to the same value that it would have obtained without intervention. Additional constraints are explored in <ref> (Pearl 1995b) </ref>.
