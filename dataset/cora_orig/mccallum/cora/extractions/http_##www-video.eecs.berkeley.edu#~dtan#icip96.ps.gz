Abstract: Scalable video compression is becoming increasingly more important in diverse, heterogeneous networks of today. In our previous work [2], we developed a scalable codec capable of generating bit rates from tens of kilo bits per second to several mega bits per second with fine granularity of available bit rates. This codec is based on 3-D subband coding and multi-rate quantization of subband coefficients, followed by arithmetic coding. In this paper, we will replace the arithmetic coding portion of the codec in [2] with block coding, and compare encode/decode speed of this new coder with MPEG. Unlike MPEG, this codec requires symmetric computational power at the decoder and encoder and as such is useful in software only, real time, interactive video applications. We have found the encoding speed of the new encoder to be one order of magnitude faster than MPEG-1, without significant loss in compression efficiency.

Reference-contexts: As we will see later, we can exploit this for efficient coding. We will now show how hierarchical block coding techniques can be used to code significant maps. The basic hierarchical block coding technique we use was presented in an early work by Kunt <ref> [1] </ref> for two-level images. Kunt's method begins by partitioning an image into 16 fi 16 blocks. If the block contains all zeros, the block is coded as a "0", and the algorithm proceeds to the next block.

Reference-contexts: Real-time MPEG decoding is already happening [3]. However, MPEG lacks the multi-rate, multi-resolution capability as often desired for transmission over heterogeneous networks. Recently a scalable video compression algorithm has been proposed <ref> [2] </ref> that not only This work was supported by NSF grant MIP-9057466, ONR grant N00014-92-J-1732, AFOSR contract F49620-93-1-0370, California State Program MICRO, Philips, SUN Microsystems, LG electronics and Tektronix. operates at a wide range of bit rates, from tens of kilo bits to several megabits per second, but also provides a <p> In addition, these properties are achieved without loss of compression efficiency as compared to standard algorithms such as MPEG. However unlike MPEG where the encoding is considerably more compute intensive as compared to decoding, the scalable algorithm in <ref> [2] </ref> requires symmetric computation power in encoding and decoding. This codec is based on 3-D subband coding and multi-rate quantization of subband coefficients, followed by arithmetic coding. <p> This symmetric encode/decode capability is a direct consequence of the fact that unlike MPEG, there is no motion vector estimation in the 3-D subband codec. In profiling the encode/decode times of the codec in <ref> [2] </ref>, we find arithmetic coding to be a major bottle neck. For instance decoding one SIF size frame at 500 kilo bits per second using a 170 Mhz Ultra Sparc requires 91 msec, of which 51 mili seconds is devoted to arithmetic decoding. <p> For instance decoding one SIF size frame at 500 kilo bits per second using a 170 Mhz Ultra Sparc requires 91 msec, of which 51 mili seconds is devoted to arithmetic decoding. In this paper, we improve speed limitations of arithmetic coding portion of the codec in <ref> [2] </ref> by replacing it with block decoding. This new codec still enjoys symmetric encode/decode properties, but more importantly, can achieve encode speeds of up to one order of magnitude faster than MPEG-1, without significant loss in compression efficiency. The outline of the paper is as follows. <p> Section 2 describes the way block coding is applied to layered quantization, section 3 describes implementation details, and section 4 describes speed and efficiency comparisons with MPEG. 2. ZERO CODING BASED ON HIERARCHICAL BLOCK CODING One of the most compute intensive parts of the codec in <ref> [2] </ref> is arithmetic coding of multi-rate quantized 3-D subband coefficients. In this section, we will propose block coding as an alternative to the arithmetic coding of subband coefficients. <p> Decreasing the number of temporal decompositions from two to one sometimes adversely affects the SNR, and improves encode/decode speed. Finally, note that it is possible to improve the PSNR of the 3-D scalable codec described here, by applying pan compensation techniques described in <ref> [2] </ref>. However, this is at the expense of increased computational complexity at the encoder. To summarize, the proposed scalable codec outperforms MPEG in encoding speed by an order of magnitude without significant loss in PSNR.

Reference-contexts: Currently, most real-time decoding mechanisms resort to expensive special purpose hardwares that become outdated quickly. A software implementation is clearly superior not only in being cheaper, but also in being easily portable to virtually any machine with performance scaling automatically with processing power. Real-time MPEG decoding is already happening <ref> [3] </ref>. However, MPEG lacks the multi-rate, multi-resolution capability as often desired for transmission over heterogeneous networks. <p> Similar approach can be used to reduce the number of memory loads for subband synthesis. 4. PERFORMANCE COMPARISON WITH MPEG-1 In this section, we compare the performances of the scalable codecs to that of MPEG-1. We use the Berke-ley Plateau Multimedia Group MPEG-1 codec <ref> [3] </ref>, v. 1.5b, with search range of 7 pixels and a GOP pattern of IBPB, except for md mpeg at 3Mb/s in Table 2 which uses IP. The number of spatial decomposition is 4 for the luminance component and 3 for each of the chroma components of the scalable codec.
