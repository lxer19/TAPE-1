Abstract: proaches with failure rate 0.2. With the more frequent failures, the number of misses made by the random approach increases, resulting in more transactions being aborted, hence an even lower data availability and also a lower throughput. Now, its data availability ranges from 0.76 to 0.65 when the transaction rate varies from 5.5 to 35.0, while its throughput ranges from 3.46 to 20.02. In contrast, there is not a similar decline in data availability under the estimated-uplist approach. Its data availability ranges from 1.0 to 0.83, while its throughput varies from 4.9 to 25.3 in the figure. Hence compared to the random approach, the estimated-uplist approach enjoys a better throughput as well as a better data availability as failures occur more frequently. A puzzling aspect of the results is that the response time appears to be better under the random approach even as its throughput is worse. The explanation is as follows. When failures are frequent, the random selection of a quorum is likely to include a failed site, which leads to the transaction being aborted. The likelihood of such a "miss" increases with the number of operations in the transaction. Hence the transactions which commit under the random approach are relatively short, resulting in a small overall response time. In this paper, we have proposed a simple implementation of the quorum consensus protocol based on the knowledge of the estimated status of all replica sites. We believe that this implementation is viable and effective, and hence that the quorum consensus protocol, a simple and elegant protocol for replica control which has not been embraced by industrial implementors, can be implemented simply and efficiently.
