Title: Performance Evaluation of Connection Rerouting Schemes for ATM-based Wireless Networks  
Author: Ramachandran Ramjee, Thomas La Porta, Jim Kurose, Don Towsley 
Abstract: Supporting mobility in ATM-based broadband networks with wireless access links poses many technical challenges. One of the most important of these challenges is the need to reroute on-going connections to/from mobile users as these users move among base-stations. Connection rerouting schemes must exhibit low handoff latency, maintain efficient routes, and limit disruption to continuous media traffic while minimizing reroute updates to the network switches. In this paper we propose, describe an implementation, and experimentally evaluate the performance of five different connection rerouting schemes. We show that one of these schemes, which operates in two phases, executes very fast reroutes (with a measured latency of 6.5 milliseconds) in a real-time phase and, if necessary, reroutes again in a non-real-time phase to maintain efficient routing. The scheme also results in negligible disruption to both audio (e.g., a 1-in-100 chance of a single packet loss at CD-quality audio rates of 128kb/s) and low bit rate video (e.g., a 2-in-100 chance of a single packet loss for 1Mb/s video) traffic during connection rerouting. Based on these results, we conclude that simple handoff schemes coupled with a connection management architecture are sufficient for supporting low bit rate continuous media applications over ATM-based wireless networks.

However, there has been very little experimental evaluation of the various rerouting procedures. In [14], rerouting is implemented such that there is no loss and very little disruption of user traffic. <p> The cross-over switch simply reroutes data traffic through a different path to the new base-station, with the connection from the source to the cross-over switch remaining unmodified. The footprint schemes of <ref> [1] </ref> fall into this category. The goal of an ordered approach is to provide ordered, loss-less data delivery during handoffs. The incremental and multicast-based rerouting schemes of [7] fall into this category.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the few packets that the mobile host might have missed due to non-overlapping cells would be retransmitted to the mobile host. A similar solution has recently been proposed for handoff in IP networks <ref> [2] </ref>. 10 Conclusion In this paper we have proposed and examined five different connection rerouting schemes in ATM-based wireless networks. We began by classifying the different handoff approaches studied to date and identifying five simple and easily implementable schemes for our experimental study.

Reference-contexts: In order to reroute a connection, an ATM switch must modify its translation table entries that control its internal cell routing. A translation table entry in an ATM switch is a mapping between two 3-tuples, corresponding to the input and output of the switch <ref> [4] </ref>. Each 3-tuple consists of a port, a Virtual Path Identifier (VPI) and a Virtual Channel Identifier (VCI). <p> The ATM switch channel server is directly connected to the switch. The channel server uses the SNMP interface at the (FORE) ATM switch to modify translation table entries. We chose the SNMP interface as opposed to FORE's proprietary SPANS signaling protocol <ref> [4] </ref> to modify the switch translation table entries since we were able to obtain a smaller vulnerability period for the Break-Make operation through the SNMP interface.

Reference-contexts: Thus, an expected packet loss of 0.35 packets translates approximately to the loss of a single packet every 3 handoffs. Also, note that the use of the make-break scheme requires that an application handle/distinguish duplicate packets, as in the case of an internet packetized audio application such as vat <ref> [6] </ref>. In Figure 7, we show the result of the same experiment using configuration II of the testbed (ethernet substituted for the wireless link).

However, as discussed before, long "chains" will likely result in performance degradation for the connection, and inefficient routing in the wired network. In <ref> [9] </ref>, the authors propose loop-detection and elimination as an optimization that reduces network inefficiencies. Note that unlike the basic chaining procedure itself, loop-elimination can result in packet loss without sophisticated synchronization and buffering schemes.

Reference-contexts: The focus of this paper is on experimental evaluation of disruption caused by connection rerouting schemes. We note that a base-station will perform a variety of other functions including call admission control for providing guarantees on forced call termination probabilities <ref> [12] </ref>, assigning frequency slots or codes, power control, etc. In this paper, we assume that sufficient bandwidth is available on the wireless as well as wired links so that the connection is not terminated during handoff.

Reference-contexts: Note that in the chaining scheme, we can provision bandwidth between neighboring base-stations and thereby avoid modifying the switch routing entries. Thus, there is a clear trade-off between the amount of bandwidth provisioned and the number of reroute updates. In <ref> [13] </ref>, we show through analy 11 sis how to determine the amount of provisioned bandwidth based on the switch processing capacity. Thus, the amount of provisioned bandwidth can be used as a tunable parameter for engineering network resources.
