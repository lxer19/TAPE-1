Abstract: Refinement equations involving matrix masks are receiving a lot of attention these days. They can play a central role in the study of refinable finitely generated shift-invariant spaces, multires-olutions generated by more than one function, multi-wavelets, splines with multiple knots, and matrix subdivision schemes | including Hermite-type subdivision schemes. Several recent papers on this subject begin with an assumption on the eigenstructure of the mask, pointing out that this assumption is heuristically "natural" or "preferred". In this note, we prove that stability of the shifts of the refinable function requires this assumption.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we demonstrate that this is a very reasonable assumption by proving that without such an assumption, the refinable function vector can not possibly have stable shifts.
