Abstract: A number of techniques have been developed for reconstructing surfaces by integrating groups of aligned range images. A desirable set of properties for such algorithms includes: incremental updating, representation of directional uncertainty, the ability to fill gaps in the reconstruction, and robustness in the presence of outliers. Prior algorithms possess subsets of these properties. In this paper, we present a volumetric method for integrating range images that possesses all of these properties. Our volumetric representation consists of a cumulative weighted signed distance function. Working with one range image at a time, we first scan-convert it to a distance function, then combine this with the data already acquired using a simple additive scheme. To achieve space efficiency, we employ a run-length encoding of the volume. To achieve time efficiency, we resample the range image to align with the voxel grid and traverse the range and voxel scanlines synchronously. We generate the final manifold by extracting an isosurface from the volumetric grid. We show that under certain assumptions, this isosur-face is optimal in the least squares sense. To fill gaps in the model, we tessellate over the boundaries between regions seen to be empty and regions never observed. Using this method, we are able to integrate a large number of range images (as many as 70) yielding seamless, high-detail models of up to 2.6 million triangles.

Reference-contexts: Edelsbrunner and Mucke [9] generalize the notion of a convex hull to create surfaces called alpha-shapes. Examples of implicit surface reconstruction include the method of Hoppe, et al [16] for generating a signed distance function followed by an isosurface extraction. More recently, Bajaj, et al <ref> [1] </ref> used alpha-shapes to construct a signed distance function to which they fit implicit polynomials. Although unorganized points algorithms are widely applicable, they discard useful information such as surface normal and reliability estimates.

Reference-contexts: A major advantage of the unorganized points algorithms is the fact that they do not make any prior assumptions about connectivity of points. In the absence of range images or contours to provide connectivity cues, these algorithms are the only recourse. Among the parametric surface approaches, Boissanat <ref> [2] </ref> describes a method for De-launay triangulation of a set of points in 3-space. Edelsbrunner and Mucke [9] generalize the notion of a convex hull to create surfaces called alpha-shapes.

Reference-contexts: Several algorithms have been proposed for integrating structured data to generate implicit functions. These algorithms can be classified as to whether voxels are assigned one of two (or three) states or are samples of a continuous function. Among the discrete-state volumetric algorithms, Connolly <ref> [4] </ref> casts rays from a range image accessedas a quad-tree into a voxel grid stored as an octree, and generates results for synthetic data.

Reference-contexts: Note that depending on the scanner geometry, the mapping from voxels to range image pixels may not be linear, in which case care must be taken to resample appropriately <ref> [5] </ref>. For the case of merging range data only in the vicinity of the surface, we try to avoid processing voxels distant from the surface. To that end, we construct a binary tree of minimum and maximum depths for every adjacent pair of resampled range image scanlines.

Reference-contexts: The center of the image pulse maps to the center of the laser, yielding a range value. The uncertainty, x , in determining the center of the pulse results in range uncertainty, z along the laser's line of sight. When using the spacetime analysis for optical triangulation <ref> [6] </ref>, the uncertainties run along the lines of sight of the CCD. (b) In 3D, a laser stripe triangulation scanner first spreads the laser beam into a sheet of light with a cylindrical lens. The CCD observes the reflected stripe from which a depth profile is computed. <p> Figure 1b illustrates the scanning geometry: an object translates through a plane of laser light while the reflections are triangulated into depth profiles through a CCD camera positioned off axis. To improve the quality of the data, we apply the method of spacetime analysis as described in <ref> [6] </ref>. The benefits of this analysis include reduced range noise, greater immunity to reflectance changes, and less artifacts near range discontinu-ities. When using traditional triangulation analysis implemented in hardware in our Cyberware scanner, the uncertainty in triangulation for our system follows the lines of sight of the expanding laser beam. <p> To explore robustness, we scanned a thin drill bit using the traditional method of optical triangulation. Due to the false edge extensions inherent in data from triangulation scanners <ref> [6] </ref>, this particular object poses a formidable challenge, yet the volumetric method behaves robustly where the zippering method [30] fails catastrophically. The dragon sequence in Figure 11 demonstrates the effectiveness of carving space for hole filling.

Reference-contexts: Gaps in the mesh prevent the algorithm from creating a fair parameterization. As another example, rapid prototyping technologies such as stereolithography typically require a watertight model in order to construct a solid replica <ref> [7] </ref>. One option for filling holes is to operate on the reconstructed mesh. If the regions of the mesh near each hole are very nearly planar, then this approach works well.

Reference-contexts: The results have been used for robot navigation, but not for surface extraction. A difficulty with this technique is the fact that the best description of the surface lies at the peak or ridge of the probability function, and the problem of ridge-finding is not one with robust solutions <ref> [8] </ref>. This is one of our primary motivations for taking an iso-surface approach in the next section: it leverages off of well-behaved surface extraction algorithms. The discrete-state implicit function algorithms described above also have much in common with the methods of extracting volumes from silhouettes [15] [21] [23] [27].

Reference-contexts: Unseen portions of the surface will appear as holes in the reconstruction. While this result is an accurate representation of the known surface, the holes are esthetically unsatisfying and can present a stumbling block to follow-on algorithms that expect continuous meshes. In <ref> [17] </ref>, for example, the authors describe a method for parameterizing patches that entails the weight, w, and signed distance, d, needed to update the voxel by casting a ray from the sensor, through the voxel onto the range surface.

Reference-contexts: As a result, we leverage off of a successful idea from the volume rendering community: for best memory system performance, stream through the volume and the image simultaneously in scanline order <ref> [18] </ref>. In general, however, the scanlines of a range image are not aligned with the scanlines of the voxel grid, as shown in Figure 7a. By suitably resampling the range image, we obtain the desired alignment (Figure 7b).

These algorithms typically perform better than unorganized point algorithms, but they can still fail catastrophically in areas of high curvature, as exemplified in Figure 9.

Since we know which triangles correspond to hole fillers, we need only concentrate the surface filtering on the these portions of the mesh. This localized filtering preserves the detail in the observed surface reconstruction.
