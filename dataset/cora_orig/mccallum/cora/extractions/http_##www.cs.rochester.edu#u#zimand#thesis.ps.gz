Reference-contexts: However, given that in this study our comparisons are based on power indices, it seems natural to add to the six historical algorithms 1 an algorithm tailored to achieve harmony between power indices and quotas. We have used a heuristic based on the simulated annealing paradigm (see <ref> [AK89] </ref>), which finds an apportionment that seeks to achieve a local minimum of 1 By the use of "the" in the context "the six historical algorithms" we do not mean to suggest that no other methods have been proposed.

Reference-contexts: But how does DTIME [O (log n)] relate to AC 0 ? After all, AC 0 is a very weak class itself and it is known from the work of Ajtai <ref> [Ajt83] </ref> that the languages in AC 0 are in a large proportion (of strings at each sufficiently large length n) constant on proper cylinders partitioning the domain (i.e., n ) and, thus, a machine could, in principle, approximate them without reading the whole input.

Reference-contexts: The above properties are obtained by following the ideas of Allender <ref> [All89] </ref> and Han and Hemaspaandra [HH95] that relate the existence of secure pseudo-random generators to the existence of large sets with some appropriate density of strings of low time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. <p> Thus, the generator would not be secure against statistical tests of power C. These ideas were used in <ref> [All89] </ref> and in [HH95] to infer conditions under which pseudo-random generators secure against attacks of various computational power do not exist. We use these ideas in the other direction. Nisan [Nis91] has displayed pseudo-random generators which are demonstrated to be secure against AC 0 statistical tests.

Reference-contexts: Then, using Lemmas 3.2.7, 3.2.8, 3.2.9, the result follows. 3.3 Qualitative Aspects of Relativized Separations Relativization results have a long but increasingly checkered history. Today, there are conflicting views as to the extent to which relativization results give insight into the structure of feasible computation <ref> [HCRR90; All90; HCC + 92; For94] </ref>, even as oracle construction has remained an active area|especially regarding strong separations (such as generic and probability one oracles, see, e.g., [FFKL93; Ver92; KMR92]) and constructions via Kolmogorov complexity (see, e.g., [GTWB90; HJ95]). <p> Some worry that recent non-relativizing equality and completeness theorems [Sha92; FS88; HJV93] undercut our faith in oracles, while others argue that the domain of such non-relativizable results seems restricted, and thus relativization is still a useful concept in many domains (see, e.g., the eloquent essays by Allender <ref> [All90] </ref> and Fortnow [For94]). However, such conflicts notwithstanding, it is unarguable that stronger relativized separations are no less convincing than weaker ones. And, going a step further, it is relatively safe to suggest that if one does study relativized separations, one should seek to establish the strongest such separations possible.

Reference-contexts: The following definitions come from the latter paper, restricted to the necessities of the current work. For motivations and connections with classical measure theory, we direct the reader to Lutz [Lut92; Lut93], Allender and Strauss <ref> [AS94] </ref>, and to Mayordomo [May94a; May94b] (see also the informal discussion in Section 1.2). Let fl and 1 be the sets of finite and respectively infinite binary strings and let denote the empty string. <p> view of the currently growing theory of effective measure and topological size in computational complexity (for starting pointers in the literature see, for abstract complexity theory, the first chapter of this thesis and, for structural complexity theory, the articles by Lutz [Lut90; Lut93], Mayordomo [May94a], Fenner [Fen91], Allender and Strauss <ref> [AS94] </ref>, Zimand [Zim93b]). Beside this, the above results have a certain technical relevance. <p> Roughly speaking, the dependency set of a martingale consists of the bits of the input that are actually used by the martingale in the computation. Allender and Strauss <ref> [AS94] </ref> have shown that keeping the dependency set small is sufficient in order to construct measures that are significant in deterministic time classes below E. 70 It follows from our construction that if C is any deterministic complexity class closed under taking the square, the class of C ffi log-approximable sets <p> This is needed to guarantee that S f2C DTIME [f ] does not have [C]-measure zero and thus the (C)-measure is meaningful for measuring the size of classes included in S f2C DTIME [f ]. Allender and 73 Strauss <ref> [AS94] </ref> have observed that one more constraint must be imposed on martingales for defining useful measures in subexponential time classes. <p> is the minimal subset of f1; 2; : : :; jwjg such that for each i 2 G M;w , M can compute M (w (1 : i)) reading only the bits of w (1 : i) located at addresses in G M;w (this is slightly more liberal than in <ref> [AS94] </ref> but all their theorems hold in this setting too). If these conditions are fulfilled, we say that the martingale is (C) computable. Note that if C contains exponential functions 2 cn with c 1 the condition on the dependency set is implicitly satisfied. We proceed with the formal definitions. <p> Machines working in sublinear time are defined by allowing random access to the read-only input tape and yield quite respectable complexity classes. For example, Allen-der and Strauss <ref> [AS94] </ref> consider machines that work in O (log n) time in order to define a meaningful notion of measure inside P.

Reference-contexts: e.g., for some ffi &gt; 0, there exists no polynomial-time algorithm approximating the size of the maximum clique of a graph within a factor of O (n ffi ), where n is the length of the encoding of the graph, unless P = NP (Arora, Lund, Motwani, Sudan, and Szegedy <ref> [ALM + 92] </ref>), upper bounds on the approximation ratio: e.g., for some c &gt; 0, there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that approximates, within the factor c, the number of clauses of a boolean formula in conjunctive normal form that can be simultaneously satisfied (Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [PY91]). <p> Moreover, Khanna, Motwani, Sudan, and 113 Vazirani [KMSV94] have shown that the class of NP optimization problems admitting polynomial-time constant ratio approximating algorithms coincides with the class of problems that are reducible to MAX SNP via a certain type of reduction that preserves approximation properties. Arora et al. <ref> [ALM + 92] </ref> have shown, via a reduction from a PCP, that no complete problem in MAX SNP can be approximated with arbitrarily small constant approximation ratio (i.e., have PTAS), unless NP = P.

Reference-contexts: separations is not new to our investigations here; the history of relativization clearly shows the drive towards stronger and stronger separations (e.g., relativized separations of the polynomial hierarchy have been extended from simple separations to stronger separations, see [BGS75; Tor86; TB89; Ko90; Bru92], from simple oracles to random oracles, see <ref> [BG81; Bab87; Cai89] </ref>, and to generic oracles, see [BI87]. <p> More recent papers have shown that the Boolean hierarchy is infinite with probability one [Cai87] and that PSPACE differs from the polynomial hierarchy with probability one <ref> [Bab87; Cai89] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: resource, for appropriate values of k and ffi (hierarchy theorems, see [HU79]), the existence of NP sets that are neither in P nor NP-complete, under the hypothesis P 6= NP (Ladner [Lad75]), the existence of an oracle A such that P A 6= NP A (Baker, Gill, and Solo vay <ref> [BGS75] </ref>), the equivalence of the existence of one-way functions and pseudo random generators (see H-astad, Impagliazzo, Levin, and Luby [HILL91]); 4 * Concrete complexity theory: upper and lower bound results: the existence or non-existence of an algorithm that solves a given problem in some specified time or using a given amount <p> See also [Wil85a; MS91], which differ in requiring asymptotic half disagreement over all strings, rather than merely over the strings in the approximating set.)

Each of the separation types listed above yields a second, and potentially stronger, separation when it holds with probability one (i.e., "relative to a random oracle"), a notion introduced by Bennett and Gill [BG81]. <p> Informally, A is C-immune if A is so complex that not only is it not in C, but no infinite C set can "approximate" A in the sense of accepting an infinite number of its elements and no element of its complement.

Reference-contexts: House of Representatives. The "fairness" is defined here by the degree to which the normalized power indices of states match their population quota. Of course, the historical algorithms were designed (in part|the full story is more complex and political, and indeed led to the first presidential veto (see <ref> [BY82] </ref>)) to achieve some degree of harmony and fairness between allocations and quotas. This is not surprising, given that power indices had not yet been invented. <p> Other methods have indeed been proposed (e.g., the method Condorcet suggested in 1793 ([Con47], see <ref> [BY82, p. 63] </ref>)).

Reference-contexts: For example, Allen-der and Strauss [AS94] consider machines that work in O (log n) time in order to define a meaningful notion of measure inside P. More relevant to our result, Barrington, Im-merman, and Straubing <ref> [BIS90] </ref> argue convincingly that machines running in O (log n) time yield the proper, robust, notion of uniformity for polynomial-size, constant-depth circuits (i.e., AC 0 circuits).

Reference-contexts: It can be shown that weight (+)-k-HYPERVERTEX COVER continues to be constant approximable (the results in <ref> [BE81] </ref> and [Hoc82] concerning weight (+) VERTEX COVER can be extended to weight (+)-k-HYPERVERTEX COVER). Chvatal [Chv79] has proved that weight (+)- SET COVER also continues to be log approximable.

Reference-contexts: All the problems in this class have polynomial-time approximation algorithms with the approximation ratio bounded by log n, where n is the length of the input. A further step was taken by Behrendt, Compton, and Gradel <ref> [BCG92] </ref> who considered more powerful logics obtained by adding the least fixpoint operator to the first-order syntax. It is observed that MAX F P 1 , which is just MAX 1 extended with the least fixpoint operator, continues to be approximable within a constant factor. <p> It is observed that MAX F P 1 , which is just MAX 1 extended with the least fixpoint operator, continues to be approximable within a constant factor. Limit laws have been identified for many of the above classes <ref> [BCG92; GM93] </ref>. These laws, similar to the 0-1 laws for various logics (see the survey paper [Com88]) constitute useful necessary criteria for the expressibility of a problem in the restricted syntax that define the respective classes.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, this is just a weakening of the property that membership is polynomial-time computable for A.

Reference-contexts: Such reductions have been extensively used in the last years in investigating and solving long-standing open problems regarding the approximation properties of many natural combinatorial optimization problems ([ALM + 92; Bel92; BS94; Con91; FGL + 91; FL92; LY93a; LY94; Zuc93; Zim93a]. We introduce now the necessary terminology. Following <ref> [BGLR93] </ref>, we denote by MIP 1 (r; p; a; q; *) a one round multiprover interactive system in which the number of random bits is r (n), the number of provers is p (n), the size of each verifier's query is q (n), the size of each prover's answer is a <p> There has been a stream of important works [BFL91; ALM + 92; FGL + 91; FRS88; FL92; BGLR93; FK94; PS94] leading to multiprover interactive systems accepting the NP complete set SAT with increasingly better parameters r; p; a; q; *. We use the following variant (see <ref> [BGLR93] </ref>). Theorem 4.4.1 SAT is accepted by a MIP 1 (O (log 3 n); 2; O (log 3 n); O (log 3 n); 1=n). We use a general technique to prove that a maximization problem A is hard to approximate. <p> The result is tight since it is known <ref> [BGLR93] </ref> that NP MIP 1 (O (log n); O (log n); O (1); O (log n); 2 (n) ): Proof of Proposition 4.4.4: We prove (1) (the proof of (2) is analogous).

Reference-contexts: We will achieve ff = fi = 1 and then we use the results of Bellare, Goldreich and Sudan <ref> [BGS95] </ref> stating that if P 6= NP (NP 6= coRP) then INDEPENDENT SET is not approximable in polynomial time with ratio n c for any c &lt; 1=4 (respectively, c &lt; 1=3).

Reference-contexts: Each of the separation types listed above yields a second, and potentially stronger, separation when it holds with probability one (i.e., "relative to a random oracle"), a notion introduced by Bennett and Gill <ref> [BG81] </ref>. Figure 3.2 shows the 56 relations between these relativized separation notions. <p> Some other examples: though BPP [Gil77], bounded probabilistic time, is known to have very strong non-probability-one separations from a variety of classes [GG86; EHTY92], it is also known to collapse to P with probability one <ref> [BG81] </ref>; though NP can be separated in relativized worlds from P with bi-immunity (even with probability one [BG81]), it is known that relative to a generic oracle NP has no infinite P-immune sets [BI87]. <p> examples: though BPP [Gil77], bounded probabilistic time, is known to have very strong non-probability-one separations from a variety of classes [GG86; EHTY92], it is also known to collapse to P with probability one <ref> [BG81] </ref>; though NP can be separated in relativized worlds from P with bi-immunity (even with probability one [BG81]), it is known that relative to a generic oracle NP has no infinite P-immune sets [BI87]. <p> separations is not new to our investigations here; the history of relativization clearly shows the drive towards stronger and stronger separations (e.g., relativized separations of the polynomial hierarchy have been extended from simple separations to stronger separations, see [BGS75; Tor86; TB89; Ko90; Bru92], from simple oracles to random oracles, see <ref> [BG81; Bab87; Cai89] </ref>, and to generic oracles, see [BI87]. <p> The notion of probability one relativizations was introduced by Bennett and Gill <ref> [BG81] </ref>, who showed, for example, that P and NP differ with probability one. More recent papers have shown that the Boolean hierarchy is infinite with probability one [Cai87] and that PSPACE differs from the polynomial hierarchy with probability one [Bab87; Cai89]. <p> Building upon the seminal work of Bennett and Gill <ref> [BG81] </ref>, we show that NP is P balanced immune with probability one. This result should be compared with Vereshchagin's [Ver92] powerful result that NP and coNP are mutually immune relative to a random oracle. <p> Fortunately, they are sufficiently close to satisfying the last two requirements such that the limit of S n =n exists with probability 1.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, random bits are hard and expensive to produce. Generating them by special-purpose devices such as Geiger counters or Zener diodes is slow and the outcomes must still be further processed (see [SV86] and <ref> [Blu84] </ref>). One solution to reduce the costs of getting good random bits is to share the random source. We can think of a scenario where there is a public server that provides random bits to anyone requesting them.

Reference-contexts: a variety of classes [GG86; EHTY92], it is also known to collapse to P with probability one [BG81]; though NP can be separated in relativized worlds from P with bi-immunity (even with probability one [BG81]), it is known that relative to a generic oracle NP has no infinite P-immune sets <ref> [BI87] </ref>. Indeed, Foster [Fos93] and Kurtz [Kur83b] have shown that the fact that a results holds with respect to a generic oracle, or holds with probability one, does not necessarily prove that the results holds in the unrelativized world. <p> the history of relativization clearly shows the drive towards stronger and stronger separations (e.g., relativized separations of the polynomial hierarchy have been extended from simple separations to stronger separations, see [BGS75; Tor86; TB89; Ko90; Bru92], from simple oracles to random oracles, see [BG81; Bab87; Cai89], and to generic oracles, see <ref> [BI87] </ref>. <p> Blum and Impagliazzo <ref> [BI87] </ref> have advocated the study of complexity classes relativized with generic oracles, by noting that in some cases generic oracles are less capable of distorting reality than random oracles.

Reference-contexts: If F is a total effective operator such that F (f ) is much bigger than f , are we guaranteed that C F (f) ? The Operator Gap Theorem (see Constable <ref> [Con72] </ref>, Calude [Cal88] and Young [You73]) gives a surprisingly negative result to this question: There are functions f such that C F (f) . Our next result shows that there are many such functions.

Reference-contexts: The 155 most notorious example is probably the SHORTEST PATH problem (see <ref> [CLR90] </ref>). Our results offer an explicit expression to this paradigm: most classes of combinatorial problems known to have good approximation algorithms when dealing with positive parameters, lose this property when dealing with arbitrary parameters.

Reference-contexts: We present below the complete construction of a strong randomized pseudo-random generator. Our starting point is also the strong randomized one-way function from [Imp96].

Reference-contexts: the determination, for the cases of NT and generic oracles, and of NP and probability one separations, of which such separations can be achieved. 57 In particular, we analyze, in terms of the hierarchy of Figure 3.2, the relativized separation from P possible for the class NT (the "near-testable" sets <ref> [GJY87; GHJY91] </ref>). We show that NT is P bi-immune relative to a generic oracle. This is optimal in terms of the hierarchy of Figure 3.2, as we note that NT is not P balanced immune (and this result itself relativizes). <p> NT, the class of near-testable sets, was defined as a generalized notion of feasibility; though membership testing may be complex for NT sets, it is feasible to test whether exactly one of an element and the lexicographically adjacent smaller element are in the set.

The answer is that NT and P indeed are essentially the same class, as shown by the already-mentioned result of <ref> [GHJY91] </ref> that NT is contained in P, and there is a set in NT to which every set in P honest (see [GS88]), 1-1, polynomial-time reduces. However, this connection is not tight enough to cause the P set to inherit the NT set's lack of balanced immunity. <p> Also each near 72 testable set is p-quasi-approximable and the same holds for nearly near-testable sets and locally self-reducible sets. We recall the appropriate definitions. A set A is near testable <ref> [GHJY91] </ref> if there is f 2 FP such that for each l 2 N, f (s l ) computes the truth value of the predicate (s l 2 A) (s l+1 2 A), where represents the "exclusive or."

Clearly, weight-MAX SUBDAG continues to be constant ap-proximable, because we can just disregard the edges with negative weights. We consider another important natural problem (see <ref> [GM84, p. 465 ff.] </ref> ) in weight-MAX SNP (), which is closely related to MAX SUBDAG: weight-PRIORITY ORDERING: given a set X and real-valued weights w to all pairs of distinct elements in X, find the maximum over all permutations of P In the hypothesis, NP 6 ~ P, it follows

Reference-contexts: The above properties are obtained by following the ideas of Allender [All89] and Han and Hemaspaandra <ref> [HH95] </ref> that relate the existence of secure pseudo-random generators to the existence of large sets with some appropriate density of strings of low time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. <p> Thus, the generator would not be secure against statistical tests of power C. These ideas were used in [All89] and in <ref> [HH95] </ref> to infer conditions under which pseudo-random generators secure against attacks of various computational power do not exist. We use these ideas in the other direction. Nisan [Nis91] has displayed pseudo-random generators which are demonstrated to be secure against AC 0 statistical tests. <p> Since jxj = S (L) 4L 1=h and taking into account that the above machine runs a number of steps that is polynomial in L, the conclusion follows. The following is just a derandomized version of a result due to Han and Hema-spaandra <ref> [HH95] </ref>. We need some notation. For L 2 N, x; y 2 S (L) , we define the equivalence x y if g L (x) = g L (y).

Lemma 3.6.5 [Imp96] For any polynomial q (n) and constant a &lt; 1=2, there is a positive constant b such that with probability of R in R n at least 1 2 q (n) , it holds that for all oracle circuits of size 2 an 102 (b) all strings in n have <p> If P () is a property dependent on oracles A 2 A, we say that P holds relative to a random oracle, if P rob A2A (P (A) is true ) = 1. Impagliazzo <ref> [Imp96] </ref> has shown that strong one-way functions and pseudo-random generators exist relative to a random oracle (or, in an equivalent formulation, for a set of oracles having measure one). Theorem 3.6.2 easily implies the existence of strong hard functions relative to a random oracle.

Reference-contexts: Many important minimization problems, like VERTEX COVER, DOMINATING SET, STEINER TREE and TRAVELING SALESMAN with edge weights 1 and 2, SHORTEST COMMON SUPERSTRING, are MAX SNP hard via reductions that preserve approximation properties (see Johnson <ref> [Joh92] </ref> for references and an excellent survey) and, thus, have the same approximation properties. Hence, the approximation capabilities of a large number of natural important optimization problems have been fully understood by the joint contribution of the two approaches (a) and (b).

Reference-contexts: Beside this, the above results have a certain technical relevance.

Reference-contexts: However, in some cryptographic protocols one needs private random bits such that the adversary has no means to predict them. Consider for example the perfect encryption system, one-time pad, that was invented in 1917 by Major Joseph Mauborgne and AT&T's Gilbert Vernam <ref> [Kah67] </ref>. In this system both the sender and the receiver have a common key consisting of a long string of random bits, called the one-time pad. Encryption is done by XORing bitwise the message with the one-time pad and decryption is done by XORing the ciphertext with the one-time pad.

Machines working in sublinear time are defined by allowing random access to the read-only input tape and yield quite respectable complexity classes.

Reference-contexts: The first approach was initiated by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [PY91] who introduced the classes MAX SNP and MAX NP (later called MAX 0 and MAX 1 by Kolaitis and Thakur <ref> [KT94] </ref> in an attempt to uniformize notation). <p> Therefore, no complete problem in RMAX (2) has PTAS, unless NP = P. In a later development, Kolaitis and Thakur undertook in <ref> [KT94] </ref> a comprehensive investigation of the logical characterizations of NP optimization problems. Considering arbitrary number of alternations of blocks of quantifiers, they introduced the classes MAX n , MAX n , MIN n , MIN n , n 0. <p> Kolaitis and Thakur have also introduced and investigated in <ref> [KT94] </ref> and in [KT95] the classes MAX F n , MAX F n , MIN F n , MIN F n , n 1, which are closely related to the above classes and offer a more natural logical description for some NP polynomially bounded optimization problems. <p> We consider the classes weight-MAX F n , weight-MAX F n , weight-MIN F n , weight-MIN F n , n 1, which are just the weighted variants of the MAX F n , MAX F n , MIN F n and MIN F n classes from <ref> [KT94] </ref> and [KT95]. <p> Question: Does there exists a feasible solution J 2 F A (I) such that f A (I; J) k (f A (I; J) k, in the case of a min problem)? Kolaitis and Thakur <ref> [KT94] </ref> have shown that each NP optimization problem in which the optimum is polynomially bounded in the size of an encoding of the input instance can be syntactically described as an optimization problem in which the goal is to find the max (or min) cardinality of a relation that together with <p> As an example, if I is a finite structure describing a CN F boolean formula as above, then I 2 SAT $ 9T 8c 9x [(P (x; c) ^ T (x)) _ (N (x; c) ^ :T (x))]: As mentioned above, Kolaitis and Thakur <ref> [KT94] </ref> have shown a similar property for polynomially bounded NP optimization problems. 120 Theorem 4.2.3 [KT94] Let A be a polynomially bounded NP optimization problem. <p> describing a CN F boolean formula as above, then I 2 SAT $ 9T 8c 9x [(P (x; c) ^ T (x)) _ (N (x; c) ^ :T (x))]: As mentioned above, Kolaitis and Thakur <ref> [KT94] </ref> have shown a similar property for polynomially bounded NP optimization problems. 120 Theorem 4.2.3 [KT94] Let A be a polynomially bounded NP optimization problem. <p> As in <ref> [KT94, Theorem 2] </ref> weight (+)-MAX 2 = weight (+)- MAX 1 . Thus, weight (+)-MAX F 2 = weight (+)-MAX 2 = weight (+)-MAX 1 = weight (+)-MAX F 1 . <p> The weighted versions of these classes are defined in the obvious way. These apparently obscure classes have as complete sets (under L-reductions) some very important optimization problems. Thus, it is shown in <ref> [KT94] </ref> that k-HYPERVERTEX COVER is complete for MIN F + 1 (k) (a subclass of MIN F + 1 , in which S is restricted to appear at most k times in each clause of ) and SET COVER, DOMINATING SET and HITTING SET are complete for MIN F + 2

Reference-contexts: Kolaitis and Thakur have also introduced and investigated in [KT94] and in <ref> [KT95] </ref> the classes MAX F n , MAX F n , MIN F n , MIN F n , n 1, which are closely related to the above classes and offer a more natural logical description for some NP polynomially bounded optimization problems. <p> We consider the classes weight-MAX F n , weight-MAX F n , weight-MIN F n , weight-MIN F n , n 1, which are just the weighted variants of the MAX F n , MAX F n , MIN F n and MIN F n classes from [KT94] and <ref> [KT95] </ref>. <p> Proof. Most of the proof follows closely the arguments in the similar proofs in <ref> [KT95] </ref>. For convenience, we provide the appropriate pointers. By Theorem 4.2.5, C F 2 = C NP, where C 2 fweight (+)-MAX, weight (+)-MIN, weight-MAX, weight-MINg and, thus, just from the syntactical characterization, (C F 1 ; C F 1 ) C F 2 C F 2 . <p> For convenience, we provide the appropriate pointers. By Theorem 4.2.5, C F 2 = C NP, where C 2 fweight (+)-MAX, weight (+)-MIN, weight-MAX, weight-MINg and, thus, just from the syntactical characterization, (C F 1 ; C F 1 ) C F 2 C F 2 . As in <ref> [KT95, Theorem 6.2] </ref>, MIN VERTEX COVER is in weight (+)-MIN F 1 and in weight-MIN F 1 but not in weight (+)-MAX F 1 and not in weight-MIN F 1 . <p> By the arguments in [PR93], it can be shown that MAX CLIQUE is in weight (+)-MAX F 1 and in weight-MAX F 1 but not in weight (+)-MAX F 1 and not in weight-MAX F 1 . As in <ref> [KT95, Remark 2.1 and Theorem 2.1] </ref>, weight (+)-MAX F 1 = weight (+)- MAX 1 and weight (+)-MAX F i = weight (+)-MAX i , i = 1; 2 (where weight (+)- MAX i and weight (+)-MAX i are the analogue of MAX i and MAX i but with positive weights <p> As in [KT94, Theorem 2] weight (+)-MAX 2 = weight (+)- MAX 1 . Thus, weight (+)-MAX F 2 = weight (+)-MAX 2 = weight (+)-MAX 1 = weight (+)-MAX F 1 . As in <ref> [KT95, Proposition 2.1] </ref>, weight (+)-MIN F 1 = weight (+)-MIN 1 and there exists a problem in weight (+)-MIN F 1 that is not in weight (+)-MIN 1 and, therefore, is not in weight (+)-MIN F 1 . <p> We have shown that weight (+)-MIN F 1 and weight (+)-MIN F 1 are incomparable and, thus, both classes are properly included in weight (+)-MIN F 2 . As in <ref> [KT95, Theorem 6.2] </ref>, MIN CYCLE (given a graph G, return the size of the shortest cycle in G) is in weight (+)-MIN F 2 but not in weight (+)-MIN F 2 . The only relation left unproven is weight (+)-MAX F 2 $ weight (+)-MAX F 2 . <p> MIN F + 1 and MIN F + 2 (1). These are subclasses of MIN F 1 and respectively MIN F 2 and have been identified in <ref> [KT95] </ref> to have good approximation properties. <p> COVER is complete for MIN F + 1 (k) (a subclass of MIN F + 1 , in which S is restricted to appear at most k times in each clause of ) and SET COVER, DOMINATING SET and HITTING SET are complete for MIN F + 2 (1) (see <ref> [KT95] </ref>). It is straightforward to extend these results for the weight and weight (+) versions of the problems and classes (e.g., weight VERTEX COVER is L complete for weight-MIN F + 1 (2), a.s.o.). Since k-HYPERVERTEX COVER is constant approximable and SET COVER is log approx-imable (see [KT95]), it follows that <p> 2 (1) (see <ref> [KT95] </ref>). It is straightforward to extend these results for the weight and weight (+) versions of the problems and classes (e.g., weight VERTEX COVER is L complete for weight-MIN F + 1 (2), a.s.o.). Since k-HYPERVERTEX COVER is constant approximable and SET COVER is log approx-imable (see [KT95]), it follows that all the problems in MIN F + 1 are constant approx-imable and all the problems in MIN F + 2 (1) are log approximable.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we show the existence of hard functions with respect to a random oracle. We also investigate the relation between sets decidable in exponential time (EXP) and sets accepted by polynomial-size circuits (P=poly) in worlds relativized with random oracles. It is known from the work of Lutz and Schmidt <ref> [LS93] </ref> that, relative to a random oracle A, EXP A is not included in P A =poly (actually their result is stronger in many aspects).

Reference-contexts: This approach has already been used in abstract complexity theory (Mehlhorn [Mel73], Calude [Cal82; Cal88; Cal91], Calude, Istrate, and Zimand [CIZ92], Calude and Zimand [CZ92]) and more recently in structural complexity (Lutz <ref> [Lut90] </ref>, Mayordomo [May94b], Fenner [Fen91], Zimand [Zim93b; Zim95c]). Our results may be viewed as strengthenings of the original basic theorems. For example, we show that the class of functions that are speedable in the sense of the Operator Speed-up Theorem is of second category. <p> they have an intrinsic value from the point of view of the currently growing theory of effective measure and topological size in computational complexity (for starting pointers in the literature see, for abstract complexity theory, the first chapter of this thesis and, for structural complexity theory, the articles by Lutz <ref> [Lut90; Lut93] </ref>, Mayordomo [May94a], Fenner [Fen91], Allender and Strauss [AS94], Zimand [Zim93b]).

Reference-contexts: The now standard method of defining effective and resource-bounded measure is due to Lutz <ref> [Lut92] </ref> building on earlier work of Schnorr [Sch73], and is based on effective and, respectively, resource-bounded martingales (which, roughly speaking, are betting strategies). We sketch the method at an intuitive level. <p> The recursive and resource-bounded variants of measure theory have been developed by Freidzon [Fre76], Mehlhorn [Mel74], Schnorr [Sch73], and exhaustively by Lutz <ref> [Lut92] </ref>. It is important to retain that this theory is applicable only to f0; 1g-valued functions, i.e., to predicates (and this is a major drawback of effective measure when compared to effective category; for example, the size of the class of r-honest functions cannot be analyzed in the measure-theoretic setting). <p> The following definitions come from the latter paper, restricted to the necessities of the current work. For motivations and connections with classical measure theory, we direct the reader to Lutz <ref> [Lut92; Lut93] </ref>, Allender and Strauss [AS94], and to Mayordomo [May94a; May94b] (see also the informal discussion in Section 1.2). Let fl and 1 be the sets of finite and respectively infinite binary strings and let denote the empty string. <p> A function f 2 RPRED will be identified with the infinite binary string f (0)f (1) : : : 2 1 . Lutz <ref> [Lut92] </ref> has shown that RPRED does not have recursive measure zero. This important feature makes a recursive measure meaningful for studying the size of classes of functions in RPRED with respect to the whole space RPRED. <p> The following useful result is proved by Lutz <ref> [Lut92] </ref>: A recursive union of recursive measure zero sets has recursive measure zero. <p> Such questions can be investigated more deeply using the apparatus of resource-bounded measure theory. Lutz has shown in <ref> [Lut92] </ref> that sets that are accepted by circuits of size bounded by n k for a fixed k have measure 0 in EXP. However, nothing is known about the measure of P=poly in EXP. <p> Lutz <ref> [Lut92] </ref> showed that P=poly has measure 0 in the larger class DTIME [2 n log n ] and observed that since there are oracles A that make EXP A P A =poly [Wil85b], relativizable techniques are not sufficient to prove QP (P=poly " EXP) = 0, where QP = DTIME [2

Reference-contexts: Similar results are valid for almost everywhere hard functions and for functions defining complexity gaps. We also consider the measure-theoretic approach. This is an extremely active topic in structural complexity theory (see the survey of Lutz <ref> [Lut93] </ref>), and we notice that it can be used in abstract complexity theory as well. We classify from the effective measure-theoretic point of view all classes of predicates that were analyzed in the topological setting in the early works of Mehlhorn [Mel73] and Calude [Cal82]. <p> The following definitions come from the latter paper, restricted to the necessities of the current work. For motivations and connections with classical measure theory, we direct the reader to Lutz <ref> [Lut92; Lut93] </ref>, Allender and Strauss [AS94], and to Mayordomo [May94a; May94b] (see also the informal discussion in Section 1.2). Let fl and 1 be the sets of finite and respectively infinite binary strings and let denote the empty string. <p> they have an intrinsic value from the point of view of the currently growing theory of effective measure and topological size in computational complexity (for starting pointers in the literature see, for abstract complexity theory, the first chapter of this thesis and, for structural complexity theory, the articles by Lutz <ref> [Lut90; Lut93] </ref>, Mayordomo [May94a], Fenner [Fen91], Allender and Strauss [AS94], Zimand [Zim93b]).

The striking importance of this theory relies on its machine-independent nature. Indeed, the theory is built on just two axioms (Blum axioms), and virtually any conceivable realistic model of computation is bound to satisfy the axioms. <p> Notes: 1.

Reference-contexts: That is, if pow i is the power index (Banzhaf or Shapley-Shubik) of state i, we define normpow i = R pow i 0i&lt;n pow i This is the normalization used by Mann and Shapley <ref> [MS60] </ref>. For the rest of this discussion, by power of a state we will mean its normalized power index (Banzhaf or Shapley-Shubik). Note that P 0i&lt;n normpow i = R, and thus these normalized powers make it easier to compare power-to-quota closeness.

Reference-contexts: One problem in studying power indices is that power indices are typically complete for #P [Val79a; Val79b] and, consequently, we need to perform a combinatorial search that invokes at each iteration numerous #P-complete computations. Fortunately, a dynamic programming approach, first proposed by Mann and Shapley <ref> [MS62] </ref> yields a pseudo-polynomial algorithm for computing the power indices, i.e., an algorithm whose running time is polynomial in the size of the House and in the number of states. <p> However, a dynamic programming approach will allow the exact computations of both power indices even for the relatively large inputs of the censuses involving 50 states. The algorithm was developed by Mann and Shapley <ref> [MS62] </ref>. We use the notation from the previous section.

Reference-contexts: It would be interesting 41 to find the most general class of topologies for which our results hold. Such an analysis has been studied for the case of independent statements in a formal theory (Calude, Jurgensen, and Zimand [CJZ94]). It is interesting to note, following Marcus <ref> [Mar93] </ref>, that, in real analysis, the property of meagerness of a class of functions is to some extent conditioned by the degree of effectiveness of the definition of functions. This situation extends over all previous studied sets in abstract complexity theory and includes most of the present results.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the approximation capabilities of a large number of natural important optimization problems have been fully understood by the joint contribution of the two approaches (a) and (b). However, MAX SNP and MAX NP are far from being the whole story. Panconesi and Ranjan <ref> [PR93] </ref> showed that MAX CLIQUE is not in MAX NP. This problem belongs to the class MAX 1 in which the feasible solutions are characterized by 1 formulae. By imposing a syntactical restriction on , Panconesi and Ranjan have identified, inside MAX 1 , the class RMAX (2). <p> As in [KT95, Theorem 6.2], MIN VERTEX COVER is in weight (+)-MIN F 1 and in weight-MIN F 1 but not in weight (+)-MAX F 1 and not in weight-MIN F 1 .

Reference-contexts: Motwani, Sudan, and Szegedy [ALM + 92]), upper bounds on the approximation ratio: e.g., for some c &gt; 0, there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that approximates, within the factor c, the number of clauses of a boolean formula in conjunctive normal form that can be simultaneously satisfied (Papadimitriou and Yannakakis <ref> [PY91] </ref>). The proofs of most of these results are extremely complex and are based on quite intricate constructions leading to the object whose existence is proved (here, we refer mainly to the results in abstract and structural complexity). <p> The first approach was initiated by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis <ref> [PY91] </ref> who introduced the classes MAX SNP and MAX NP (later called MAX 0 and MAX 1 by Kolaitis and Thakur [KT94] in an attempt to uniformize notation). <p> There is 115 no need to argue about the large percent of problems of this type that appear in real applications. The exception paper alluded above is again the work of Papadimitriou and Yannakakis <ref> [PY91] </ref>. <p> Or, on the other hand, if a problem is hard under L or A reductions (these are some restricted variants of reductions that preserve approximation properties; they were introduced by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis in <ref> [PY91] </ref> and Panconesi and Ranjan in [PR93]), then the existence of good approximations algorithms is highly improbable. We investigate to what extent the known properties of polynomially bounded optimization problems remain valid when we pass to the positively weighted and arbitrarily weighted corresponding problems. <p> If max A (I) = max S jf~x j (~x; I; S)gj, then A is in MAX SNP. It is known <ref> [PY91] </ref> that if A is in MAX NP or in MAX SNP, then A is constant ap-proximable. <p> The weighted variants of these classes are defined by considering m-weight assignments for the ~x tuples in the formulae above (m is the arity of ~x) and proceeding as in the definition of the classes MAX F i or MAX F i . Papadimitriou and Yannakakis have shown in <ref> [PY91] </ref> that all problems in weight (+)-MAX NP and weight (+)-MAX SNP are constant approximable. This property does not extend to weight-MAX SNP (and to weight-MAX NP), unless NP ~ P. <p> Nevertheless, this problem could be a good starting point for a chain of L reductions showing that other natural problems do not possess the superpolylog approximation property under the same hypothesis.

The family (U t ) t2FR is a system of basic neighborhoods in PR; we work with the topology generated by this system (see <ref> [Cal82; Mel73; Rog67] </ref>).

We can think of a scenario where there is a public server that provides random bits to anyone requesting them.

Reference-contexts: We also analyze the approx 9 imation properties of the problem of finding an optimal spanning hypertree.

The notion of h-hypertree was defined in <ref> [Tom86] </ref> in order to improve the Bonferroni inequalities. It is known [TZ94] that the problem of finding the optimal spanning h-hypertree of a complete hypergraph is NP complete, for h 3. We show here that no polynomial-time approximate algorithm even with poor approximation ratio seems to exist for this problem. <p> As in the case of standard graphs (i.e., h = 2), a proper notion of a hypertree is an important topic in the study of hypergraphs.

Each of the separation types listed above yields a second, and potentially stronger, separation when it holds with probability one (i.e., "relative to a random oracle"), a notion introduced by Bennett and Gill [BG81]. <p> The drive to prove strong separations is not new to our investigations here; the history of relativization clearly shows the drive towards stronger and stronger separations (e.g., relativized separations of the polynomial hierarchy have been extended from simple separations to stronger separations, see <ref> [BGS75; Tor86; TB89; Ko90; Bru92] </ref>, from simple oracles to random oracles, see [BG81; Bab87; Cai89], and to generic oracles, see [BI87].

Reference-contexts: Today, there are conflicting views as to the extent to which relativization results give insight into the structure of feasible computation [HCRR90; All90; HCC + 92; For94], even as oracle construction has remained an active area|especially regarding strong separations (such as generic and probability one oracles, see, e.g., <ref> [FFKL93; Ver92; KMR92] </ref>) and constructions via Kolmogorov complexity (see, e.g., [GTWB90; HJ95]). <p> Building upon the seminal work of Bennett and Gill [BG81], we show that NP is P balanced immune with probability one. This result should be compared with Vereshchagin's <ref> [Ver92] </ref> powerful result that NP and coNP are mutually immune relative to a random oracle. Note in particular that Vereshchagin's result does not in any obvious way imply Theorem 3.3.10. 63 Theorem 3.3.10 NP is P balanced immune relative to a random oracle. Proof.

Reference-contexts: A p-m-degree is an equivalence class under the p-m-reducibility relation. A p-m-degree collapses if all its elements are pairwise p-isomorphic. Let M s 1 ; M s 2 ; : : : be a fixed enumeration of all Turing machines. A set A is p-creative (see <ref> [Wan91] </ref>) for P if there exists a polynomial-time computable function f , which is called a p-productive function such that (8i)[L (M s i ) 2 P ) [f (s i ) is defined and [L (M s i ) A ) f (s i ) 2 A L (M s <p> The existence of such a function follows by the complexity-bounded version of the s-m-n theorem (for example see <ref> [Wan91] </ref>). Let w 0 be such that L (M w 0 ) = ; and M w 0 is a polynomial-time machine. Since ; A it follows that f j (w 0 ) 2 A n L (M w 0 ). <p> Now the conclusion follows from Proposition 3.2.4. 53 Lemma 3.2.8 Let A be an EXP p-m-complete set. Then the class of sets p-isomorphic to A is DSPACE [log O (1) n]-meagre. Proof. It is shown in <ref> [Wan91] </ref> that a set is p-m-complete for EXP if and only if it is p-creative for P via a length increasing productive function. Now we can reason as in the preceding lemma.

Reference-contexts: This chapter is based on the paper [CZ96] and the results have been obtained jointly with Cristian Calude. Chapter 3 collects the results in structural complexity theory. The sections in this chapter are almost independent as they treat distinct problems. In Section 3.2 we refine the tools used in <ref> [Zim93b] </ref> to analyze the topological size of some central classes in NP 7 and in the polynomial hierarchy by using resource-bounded witness functions in the definition of meagre sets. <p> This approach has already been used in abstract complexity theory (Mehlhorn [Mel73], Calude [Cal82; Cal88; Cal91], Calude, Istrate, and Zimand [CIZ92], Calude and Zimand [CZ92]) and more recently in structural complexity (Lutz [Lut90], Mayordomo [May94b], Fenner [Fen91], Zimand <ref> [Zim93b; Zim95c] </ref>). Our results may be viewed as strengthenings of the original basic theorems. For example, we show that the class of functions that are speedable in the sense of the Operator Speed-up Theorem is of second category. <p> Kurtz, Mahaney, and Royer [KMR90] have written an excellent survey of these topics. 43 In this section, we pursue the study, begun in <ref> [Zim93b] </ref>, of the topological size of some interesting classes of sets focusing this time on complete degrees under the p-m-reduction. We [Zim93b] have argued that neither the standard Cantor topology nor "the next natural" superset topology are adequate for studying the topological size of classes inside NP (see Section 1.2 for <p> Kurtz, Mahaney, and Royer [KMR90] have written an excellent survey of these topics. 43 In this section, we pursue the study, begun in <ref> [Zim93b] </ref>, of the topological size of some interesting classes of sets focusing this time on complete degrees under the p-m-reduction. We [Zim93b] have argued that neither the standard Cantor topology nor "the next natural" superset topology are adequate for studying the topological size of classes inside NP (see Section 1.2 for a presentation of the Cantor and superset topologies). Instead, a combination of the two is proposed. <p> A class of sets C 1 is effectively meagre (or effectively of the first category), if C is the countable union of a uniform collection of effectively nowhere dense sets, and is of effectively second category if it is not of effectively first category. It is known <ref> [Zim93b] </ref> that if P 6= NP, then the class of NP complete sets under p-Turing reducibility is effectively meagre (whereas, NP P is of effectively second category). <p> In fact, by the same argument, one can show that if C is any class not contained in P , the class of C p-Turing complete sets is effectively meagre. In this section, we refine the tools used in my earlier work <ref> [Zim93b] </ref>, and admit witness functions with bounded resources. Thus, if is a complexity class for functions, we say that C is -nowhere dense if the witness function is in . The notions of -meagre class and -second category class are defined exactly the same way as above. <p> the currently growing theory of effective measure and topological size in computational complexity (for starting pointers in the literature see, for abstract complexity theory, the first chapter of this thesis and, for structural complexity theory, the articles by Lutz [Lut90; Lut93], Mayordomo [May94a], Fenner [Fen91], Allender and Strauss [AS94], Zimand <ref> [Zim93b] </ref>). Beside this, the above results have a certain technical relevance. <p> Note that the function f as a whole is only required to be recursive, but its projections obtained by fixing the first argument should be in . It is known <ref> [Zim93b] </ref> that if C 6 P, then the class of C p-m-complete sets (even p-Turing complete sets) is recursively meagre. The first result states that, for all h 2 N , 2 log h n is not sufficient time for witnessing meagerness of any p-m-degree.

Reference-contexts: The main result states that the closure under polynomial isomorphism of the class of p-quasi-approximable sets (and consequently, also all the above-mentioned classes) has measure zero in DTIME [2 O (n) ]. In Section 3.5, which is based on the paper <ref> [Zim95a] </ref>, it is shown, informally speaking, that all large sets accepted by polynomial-size circuits with constant depth (i.e., large sets in AC 0 ) have many strings with low time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity.

Reference-contexts: Any improvement of this result for the complete p-m-degrees of RE or NP implies P 6= NP. This section is based on the paper <ref> [Zim95c] </ref>. In Section 3.3, we attempt to push to the limit the analysis of the size of oracles that separate P from NP or other important complexity classes. We consider very strong forms of separation like separation with bi-immunity or with balanced immunity. <p> This approach has already been used in abstract complexity theory (Mehlhorn [Mel73], Calude [Cal82; Cal88; Cal91], Calude, Istrate, and Zimand [CIZ92], Calude and Zimand [CZ92]) and more recently in structural complexity (Lutz [Lut90], Mayordomo [May94b], Fenner [Fen91], Zimand <ref> [Zim93b; Zim95c] </ref>).
