Title: 3D Morphing  
Author: by Matt Blum, Krzysztof Gajos, Manolis Kamvysselis, Hooman Vassef 
Abstract: This paper presents our work towards achieving a model based approach to three dimensional morphing. It describes the initial algorithms and ideas that we envisioned, the final algorithm we developed and implemented, the environment we worked in, our visualization techniques, and future work planned on the subject.
