Abstract: The tendency to saturation in the collected charge as a function of light intensity in Langmuir-Blodgett films of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (PHT) has been studied. The tendency to saturation can have two reasons; one being that the space charge limited current regime has been reached, or influence of very fast bimolecular recombination. We have studied these two cases, and we conclude that bimolecular recombination is a likely cause for the tendency to saturation. The hole mobility in PHT can therefore be estimated possibly as high as 1 cm 2 /Vs in the initial stage after photoexcitation.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The understanding of charge carrier transients, and the magnitude of the drift mobility in thin films of conjugated polymers (CPs) is still not complete, although this is of great important in applications of CPs such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) <ref> [1] </ref>. We have been able to make an lower estimate of the hole mobility in Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of poly (3-hexylthiophene) (PHT) from the near saturation of the collected charge due to light intensity.

The goal of this communication is to clarify the nature of the saturation of collected charge as function of light intensity. The results are based on the facts that the photosignal is generated instantaneously in the vicinity of the aluminum (Al) electrode [2, 3]. 2. <p> The goal of this communication is to clarify the nature of the saturation of collected charge as function of light intensity.

The actual capacity of our sandwich-type samples is of the order of 10 9 F which gives the RC time constant of the measurement setup longer than the photo-current transient time, even when the wave-guide loading resistor is 50 . <p> For such light conditions that the SCLC condition is fulfilled (Q 0 CU ), the magnitude of the photosignal saturates with light intensity <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Experimental The LB film of PHT was sandwiched between indium-tin-oxide and Al electrodes. The thickness of the LB films are 7, 13, and 21 monomolecular layers, where each layer is 3 nm thick. The details of the LB film preparation of PHT can be found elsewhere <ref> [4] </ref>. The samples were placed into the 50 waveguide and single photocurrent transient signals were registered by the 6 GHz real-time, or 50 MHz storage oscilloscopes.

To avoid redistribution of the electric field in the sample the delay time between the external voltage pulse and the light pulse was a few microseconds <ref> [5] </ref>. 4. Results The IV characteristics of PHT LB films in the dark has been reported elsewhere [6]. The LAC measured in a wide range of light intensities clearly demonstrated deviation from the linear dependence (see Fig. 1). There were not, however, any saturation as expected from SCLC.
