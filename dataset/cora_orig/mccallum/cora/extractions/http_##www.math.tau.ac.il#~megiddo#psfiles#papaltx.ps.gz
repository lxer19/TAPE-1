Title: A Note on Total Functions, Existence Theorems, and Computational Complexity  
Author: Nimrod Megiddo and Christos H. Papadimitriou 
Date: November 1989  
Abstract: Nondeterministic multivalued functions with values that are poly-nomially verifiable and guaranteed to exist form an interesting complexity class between P and NP. We show that this class, which we call TFNP, contains a host of important problems, whose membership in P is currently not known. These include, besides factoring, local optimization, Brouwer fixed points, a computational version of Sperner's Lemma, bimatrix equilibria in games, and linear complemen tarity for P -matrices.

Reference-contexts: Poljak. It is well-known (see <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> ) that in any cubic graph, there is an even number of Hamilton circuits through each edge. The proof is constructive, but goes through a possibly exponential number of Hamilton paths to find the "mate" of a given Hamilton circuit.

Reference-contexts: For others, the guarantee is the consequence of some "polynomially non-constructive" existence proof, such as Sperner's Lemma, Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem [ 5; 4 ] , or the convergence of Lemke's algorithm <ref> [ 10; 2 ] </ref> in certain cases.

Reference-contexts: A similar result, can be shown for the variant of the Brouwer fixed point problem, where we are asking for an approximate fixed point not in the neighborhood of the given one. Related results with regard to the Nash-equilibrium problem can be found in <ref> [ 3 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: For some, as with the class PLS [ 6 ] recalled below, the guarantee is very simple, based on the existence of local optima. For others, the guarantee is the consequence of some "polynomially non-constructive" existence proof, such as Sperner's Lemma, Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem <ref> [ 5; 4 ] </ref> , or the convergence of Lemke's algorithm [ 10; 2 ] in certain cases. We list some of them below. 1.2 The Class PLS Local optimality is a very rich source of problems in TFNP. <p> An interesting computational problem is as follows. Suppose f is continuous with Lipschitz constant 1, i.e., jf (x) f (y)j jx yj, and let * &gt; 0 be given. Find an *-approximate fixed point, i.e., an x such that jf (x) xj &lt; *. It was shown in <ref> [ 4; 5 ] </ref> that any algorithm which uses f as an oracle takes (1=*) steps to calculate an *-approximate fixed point. <p> Needless to say, Brouwer's Theorem guarantees that the following problem is in TFNP: given the description of a Turing machine which computes f and an * &gt; 0, find an *-approximate fixed point. The results in <ref> [ 4; 5 ] </ref> do not provide an exponential lower bound for this problem, as an algorithm may examine the structure of the machine in generating a solution. <p> The difficulty of the problem is preserved (and the lower bounds of <ref> [ 4; 5 ] </ref> still hold). 1.4 Sperner's Lemma For simplicity we discuss here only the two-dimensional case. Consider a triangle with vertices labeled 1; 2; 3, and any triangulation of its area (say, the standard n fi n triangulation depicted in Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: Each member R of TFNP possesses a different kind of guarantee for the totality of R. For some, as with the class PLS <ref> [ 6 ] </ref> recalled below, the guarantee is very simple, based on the existence of local optima. <p> We list some of them below. 1.2 The Class PLS Local optimality is a very rich source of problems in TFNP. The class PLS of polynomial local search problems was introduced in <ref> [ 6 ] </ref> . Any problem in this class, is based on an optimization problem. The input to the optimization problem is a set of data (e.g., for the traveling salesman problem (TSP), the distance matrix). <p> It is immediate that all problems in PLS are in TFNP, as the existence of local optima is guaranteed by the finiteness of the solution space. In <ref> [ 6 ] </ref> several PLS problems were shown PLS-complete.

Several specialized cases of this argument have been used elsewhere <ref> [ 6; 11 ] </ref> . It is quite interesting, in view of Theorem 2.1, that in some cases of problems in TFNP, if together with the input we are also given one of the solutions that are guaranteed to exist, then the problem indeed becomes NP-complete.

Reference-contexts: It is not known at present how to solve the LCP with a P -matrix in polynomial time. Neither is it known how to tell in sub-exponential time whether a matrix is a P -matrix. The following problem (see <ref> [ 11 ] </ref> ), which we call P-LCP, is in TFNP: given an instance M ; q of the LCP, produce either a nonpositive principal minor of M or a solution of the LCP. It would be extremely interesting if the problem P-LCP were in FP. <p> Then any unsatisfiable Boolean formula B has a certificate of unsatisfiability, namely, the string y (guaranteed to exist by the fact that R 2 TFNP) such that (f (B); y) 2 R and g (y) = NO.

Reference-contexts: Hence, this problem is called the Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP). The LCP generalizes the convex quadratic programming problem (including the linear programming problem) and (0; 1)-programming. Thus, it is NP-complete in general <ref> [ 12 ] </ref> . However, it can be solved in polynomial time by the ellipsoid method if M is positive semi-definite [ 12 ] . <p> The LCP generalizes the convex quadratic programming problem (including the linear programming problem) and (0; 1)-programming. Thus, it is NP-complete in general <ref> [ 12 ] </ref> . However, it can be solved in polynomial time by the ellipsoid method if M is positive semi-definite [ 12 ] . There is an important case of the LCP whose complexity is unknown: Suppose that M is a P -matrix, i.e., all of its principal minors 2 are positive. In this case, the LCP is guaranteed to have a unique solution [ 15 ] .

Reference-contexts: One inclusion takes R = R 1 [ R 2 , and the other takes R 1 = R and R 2 = ;. Clearly, factoring is in TFNP, as each integer possesses a unique decomposition into primes, each with a certificate a la Pratt <ref> [ 13 ] </ref> . A related problem is that of the discrete logarithm modulo a (certified) prime p of a (certified) primitive root x of p.
