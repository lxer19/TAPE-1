Reference-contexts: Because subtractive enforcement can lead weights to saturate at their most extreme allowed values, it has been suggested (Miller and MacKay, 1994) that it may be a poor choice for models of adult plasticity, where continuous plasticity occurs in response to changing input activity distributions <ref> (Kaas, 1991) </ref>. However, we demonstrate in (Miller, 1997) that this tendency to saturation can be eliminated by combining pre- and postsynaptic constraints. Elliott et al. (1996b) have found that their model, which does not show such saturation (discussed in appendix), can account for some aspects of adult plasticity.

Reference-contexts: This can lead to a bias in favor of the development of such patterns, even if such patterns have less favorable energy than others (e.g. see discussion of the effect of the DC mode's "head start" in <ref> (MacKay and Miller, 1990) </ref>). Although the zero-temperature model of Elliott et al. does not necessarily avoid this problem, a sprouting-and-retraction framework more generally may provide a natural means of avoiding such bias.

Reference-contexts: In the studies of Miller et al., the final strength of each eye's projection, as well as the stripe layout, emerged dynamically. 4 Discussion I have shown that a simple, stochastic, correlation-based sprouting-and-retraction model of synaptic development can be understood within the framework of correlation-based developmental models <ref> (Miller, 1990a,1996) </ref>, although those models were formulated in terms of modification of anatomically fixed synapses. The various models all descend in an identical energy, corresponding to maximizing a certain measure of synaptic correlations. The analyses of the correlation-based framework accurately predict the outcomes of the sprouting-and-retraction model.

Reference-contexts: The choices of constraints do not represent intrinsic differences between sprouting-and-retraction and fixed-synapse models. Either type of model might be run with either set of constraints. However, a given set of constraints may be dynamically enforced in different, inequivalent ways <ref> (Miller and MacKay, 1994) </ref>. I now address the form of enforcement needed to render a dynamical model equivalent to the model of Elliott et al.. 2 Constraint Enforcement and Energy Minimization Constraints on connectivity are utilized in developmental models to incorporate several biological facts. <p> The equations must be constrained to ensure that this time derivative respects the constraints on connectivity. There are many ways to achieve this, which are not equivalent either mathematically or in developmental outcome <ref> (Miller and MacKay, 1994) </ref>. Intuitively: the space of allowed connectivity patterns forms a constraint surface in the space of weights. The unconstrained time derivative may point off of this surface, in which case it must be corrected by return to the constraint surface. <p> Thus, given an unconstrained energy and a corresponding unconstrained gradient descent dynamics, the constraint implementation must achieve gradient descent in the energy on the constraint surface. Mathematically, this is achieved by perpendicular projection of the unconstrained gradient descent dynamics onto the constraint surface. 2 In previous work <ref> (Miller and MacKay, 1994) </ref>, two methods were studied of enforcing constraints limiting the sum of weights over a cell, subtractive and multiplicative. <p> the sum of the synaptic weights, such as P ff;I S I (x; ff) = S post | or more generally, of a constraint on a linear combination of the synaptic weights, which yields a hy-perplane constraint surface | perpendicular projection of the gradient vector corresponds to subtractive constraint enforcement <ref> (Miller and MacKay, 1994) </ref>. 3 For a hypersphere surface, 2 Beginning from a point x, the local change in energy per unit movement in direction ^v, ^v ^v = 1, is given by rE (x) ^v where rE (x) is the gradient of the energy at x. <p> Subtractive enforcement thus realizes the intuitive picture that the biological dynamics are searching, via a correlation-based mechanism, for a "most correlated" set of inputs subject to such linear constraints. Such a search might occur by sprouting and retraction, by synaptic strength modification, or by some combination. While previous work <ref> (Miller and MacKay, 1994) </ref> demonstrated the differences in outcome resulting from, and in overall energies minimized by, subtractive vs. multiplicative enforcement, the relationship to energy minimization or correlation maximization over the constraint surface was not previously noted. 3 Application of the Equivalence to Understand the Results of Elliott et al.. <p> This is based on the simple case of a linear covariance plasticity rule for a single, linearly activated postsynaptic cell. For this case, multiplicative constraint enforcement does lead to the principal component (e.g. <ref> (Miller and MacKay, 1994) </ref>), which in this case minimizes the energy of Eq. 2 over any hypersphere in weight space. <p> Because subtractive enforcement can lead weights to saturate at their most extreme allowed values, it has been suggested <ref> (Miller and MacKay, 1994) </ref> that it may be a poor choice for models of adult plasticity, where continuous plasticity occurs in response to changing input activity distributions (Kaas, 1991). However, we demonstrate in (Miller, 1997) that this tendency to saturation can be eliminated by combining pre- and postsynaptic constraints. <p> Given constraints only on presynaptic cells, an upper weight limit is required if L ii &gt; jL ij j for all j 6= i, where j and i are labels for two weights from a single presynaptic cell <ref> (Miller and MacKay, 1994) </ref>. This condition is not satisfied in the model of Elliott et al., because I (x; y) = 1 both for y = x and for y the NECO/Miller/Ms. 1232 18 neighbor of x, and A is constant where it is nonzero.

Reference-contexts: Perpendicular constraint enforcement of the full set of constraints minimizes energy. Assuming the single-cell constraint surfaces are hyperplanes, perpendicular enforcement corresponds to subtractive enforcement. However, the details of formulating perpendicular constraints in this case are somewhat more complicated. These are described briefly in <ref> (Miller, 1997) </ref>. Constraints on the strength of individual weights are also linear constraints. Thus, perpendicular projection onto the hyperplane bounding the constrained volume of allowed synaptic weights is achieved by subtracting off the non-allowed weight change from the gradient descent vector. <p> Single-synapse constraints fail to commute with constraints over summed pre- and/or postsynaptic weights. To avoid this conflict, the methods for formulating perpendicular constraints described in <ref> (Miller, 1997) </ref> can be used. In practice, more ad hoc methods are generally used to resolve the conflict; while this seems unlikely to significantly alter the developmental outcome from constrained energy minimization, this has not been note 1, in which the dynamics are gradient descent. <p> However, we demonstrate in <ref> (Miller, 1997) </ref> that this tendency to saturation can be eliminated by combining pre- and postsynaptic constraints. Elliott et al. (1996b) have found that their model, which does not show such saturation (discussed in appendix), can account for some aspects of adult plasticity. <p> In Miller and MacKay (1994), it was shown that an upper limit on the strength of individual connections is generally needed under subtractive constraints to attain distributed receptive and/or projective fields (see discussion in <ref> (Miller, 1997) </ref>). Yet Elliott et al., in the absence of an explicit upper weight limit, find apparently stable weight configurations with distributed receptive and projective fields. There seem to be at least two explanations. First, as discussed in (Miller, 1997), the combination of pre- and postsynaptic constraints can eliminate the need <p> subtractive constraints to attain distributed receptive and/or projective fields (see discussion in <ref> (Miller, 1997) </ref>). Yet Elliott et al., in the absence of an explicit upper weight limit, find apparently stable weight configurations with distributed receptive and projective fields. There seem to be at least two explanations. First, as discussed in (Miller, 1997), the combination of pre- and postsynaptic constraints can eliminate the need for an upper weight limit. Second, the particular intracortical interaction used by Elliott et al. may play a role.

Reference-contexts: This is the direction found by perpendicular projection of the negative of the gradient vector | the derivative vector under gradient descent dynamics | onto the constraint surface. 3 There are some technicalities involving the use of the arbor function, discussed in more detail in <ref> (Miller and MacKay, 1992, App. B) </ref>. Briefly: one must work in the symmetric T representation discussed in foot NECO/Miller/Ms. 1232 10 multiplicative enforcement is perpendicular projection. For other surfaces, perpendicular projection cannot be characterized as either multiplicative or subtractive. <p> The sequence of perpendicular projections onto each single-cell constraint surface results in a projection onto the full constraint surface along a linear combination of the single-cell normals, and any such linear combination is perpendicular to the full constraint surface. See <ref> (Miller and MacKay, 1992, App. C) </ref> for mathematical formulation of the projection operators that implement constraints on a network of cells. NECO/Miller/Ms. 1232 11 studied. In summary, perpendicular constraint enforcement achieves gradient descent on the multi-cell constraint surface.

Reference-contexts: This can lead to a bias in favor of the development of such patterns, even if such patterns have less favorable energy than others (e.g. see discussion of the effect of the DC mode's "head start" in <ref> (MacKay and Miller, 1990) </ref>). Although the zero-temperature model of Elliott et al. does not necessarily avoid this problem, a sprouting-and-retraction framework more generally may provide a natural means of avoiding such bias.

Reference-contexts: In kitten visual cortex, the rapidity of monocular deprivation effects, which emerge physiologically within hours <ref> (Mioche and Singer, 1989) </ref>, weakly suggests that physiological changes in synaptic efficacy may precede (and thus perhaps guide) anatomical restructuring of connections.
