Title: Implementation of a Graph Oriented Query Language IUGQL  
Author: Vijay M. Sarathy Dirk Van Gucht 
Address: Bloomington, Indiana 47405-4101, USA  
Affiliation: Indiana University Computer Science Department  
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the implementation of IUGQL 1 , a graph oriented query language for object oriented databases that is based on the Graph Oriented Object Data (GOOD) model. In the implementation, databases (graphs) are represented as a set of (named) binary relations. The graph oriented queries are translated into equivalent Tarski algebra expressions. These Tarski expressions manipulate the binary relations to yield the desired query result.

Also, in this version, composition of actions is not supported, i.e., the effects of one action cannot be used to influence subsequent actions.
