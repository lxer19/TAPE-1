Title: An Open Task Control Model for Quality of Service Adaptation  
Author: Baochun Li, Klara Nahrstedt 
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  
Abstract: Current distributed multimedia applications demand Quality of Service (QoS) from the supporting system to facilitate effective services to the end users. However, within the range of QoS demands specified by the application, lower level transport facility may not be able to constantly provide the required QoS without perturbations, especially in the case of wireless communications. In this scenario, we propose a task control model that leverages existing digital processing and control theories to introduce adaptation tasks that perform QoS adaptations on a specific QoS metric. We are also able to configure these adaptation tasks according to a desired adaptation agility of their adaptation behavior. We show the viability of the approach by some preliminary experiments.

Reference-contexts: Recent research interests in mobile computing are addressing the issues in QoS adaptations for mobile transmissions over heterogeneous wireless networks <ref> [1] </ref> [14]. These research efforts focus on graceful adaptations to dynamic QoS variations in a mobile environment. Current state-of-the-art mobile environments must deal with scarce and dynamically varying resources in the end systems or delivery paths.

Reference-contexts: For the purpose of fast prototyping and achieving capabilities to execute on heterogeneous environments, we used the Java language <ref> [4] </ref> for the implementation of the adaptation tasks. The Video-On-Demand application testbed, though, was implemented in a combination of C and Java languages, in which the MPEG-2 decompression engine was implemented in ANSI C due to the nature of MPEG-2 decompression complexity, and the display controls were implemented in Java.

Reference-contexts: By task, we refer to an application, a software component, or a module in an application. that executes so it can deliver a service or result to other system components, namely, other tasks <ref> [5] </ref>. With the definition of task in this context, if we consider a set of inter-related tasks that form a larger component, we are able to model the entire system as a task flow graph, which is, by its nature, a directed acyclic graph.

Reference-contexts: Like other digital systems, passive adaptation tasks can be classified with respect to time-invariance, causality, linearity and recursiveness [15]. In this paper, we only address the analysis and configuration of a subset of tasks that are time-invariant, causal, linear, and non-recursive. We characterize this subset with difference equations <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> One of the simplest approach that works on non-recursive difference equations is the application of Discrete Fourier Transform and its inverse transform, which may be found in some references on digital filters <ref> [6] </ref>. In order to improve the quality of the generated result after Inverse Fourier Transform, we may need to use more complex windowing functions such as the well known von Hann window or the Hamming window [6]. <p> and its inverse transform, which may be found in some references on digital filters <ref> [6] </ref>. In order to improve the quality of the generated result after Inverse Fourier Transform, we may need to use more complex windowing functions such as the well known von Hann window or the Hamming window [6]. Since the configuration process operate in the frequency domain, we need to convert the result back to time domain in the form of difference equations.

Reference-contexts: The goal of this work is also similar with the work presented in this paper, though the former only focuses on delay jitter adaptations during audio transmissions, and our work proposes a generic approach for modeling adaptation behavior. Similar research work is presented in <ref> [7] </ref>, which also focuses on jitter control of playing back continuous media streams. While the above mentioned work deals only with audio transmissions, various playout algorithms for video transmissions have also been discussed in previous research efforts, especially in the context of Video-On-Demand applications.

Reference-contexts: We will discuss these problems in later sections. For easier references, we summarize the above notations and definitions in Table 1. Given above, we are able to define the common Quality of Service metrics such as system rate, generating rate, delay, loss and jitter <ref> [8] </ref>. As an example, we give a definition for the QoS metric System Rate. System rate is generally referred to as bandwidth or throughput in a network transmission context. It denotes a QoS metric that measures the delivery speed or efficiency of any QoS quantitative data units.

Reference-contexts: Recent research interests in mobile computing are addressing the issues in QoS adaptations for mobile transmissions over heterogeneous wireless networks [1] <ref> [14] </ref>. These research efforts focus on graceful adaptations to dynamic QoS variations in a mobile environment. Current state-of-the-art mobile environments must deal with scarce and dynamically varying resources in the end systems or delivery paths. <p> The series of QoS metric values are modeled by discrete-time values, or signals, and the transformation can be modeled by difference equations as in Equation (14). One of the important factors that should be configurable for adaptation tasks is adaptation agility. First introduced in <ref> [14] </ref>, it is defined as the ability of adaptation tasks to promptly respond to sudden and unexpected perturbations in the time domain. If the agility of an adaptation task is high, it means that the task frequently and promptly reacts to short term fluctuations.
