Abstract: The SGI Origin 2000 produces three types of speedup curves on the NAS Parallel Benchmarks (NPB): linear, sub-linear, and super-linear. This paper analyzes the architecture of the Origin 2000 in order to determine the causes for these speedup behaviors. We compare the Origin 2000 to the UCB NOW cluster, which has linear speedup curves for the non-bisection limited benchmarks in the NPB suite. We show that the large cache of the Origin 2000 is the first order factor in causing the three speedup curves. Specifically, we show the effects of increasing the global cache given a benchmark's working set. We then show that given that global cache size is a first order factor in determining speedup, constant problem size scale may not be a good indicator of scalability. We hope that our results can be used in designing future scalable parallel systems and influence the way scalability is evaluated in the future.

Reference-contexts: These interconnects can be either tightly coupled with the memory system such as in distributed memory systems like the SGI Origin 2000, or it could be loosely coupled with the memory system such as in the separate high-bandwidth, low-latency network interfaces used in the UC Berkeley Networks of Workstation (NOW) <ref> [ACP+95] </ref>. In fact, the UCB NOW cluster is an example of using as much commodity components as possible: each node is a commodity workstation connected in a system area network (SAN).
