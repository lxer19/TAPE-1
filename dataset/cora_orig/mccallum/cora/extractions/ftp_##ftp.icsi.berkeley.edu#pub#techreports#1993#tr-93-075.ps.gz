Abstract: We describe a procedure which may be helpful to any disorganized carpenter who has a mixed pile of bolts and nuts and wants to find the corresponding pairs of bolts and nuts. The procedure uses our (and the carpenter's) ability to construct efficiently highly expanding graphs. The problem considered is given a collection of n bolts of distinct widths and n nuts such that there is a 1-1 correspondence between the nuts and bolts. The goal is to find for each bolt its corresponding nut by comparing nuts to bolts but not nuts to nuts or bolts to bolts. Our objective is to minimize the number of operations of this kind (as well as the total running time). The problem has a randomized algorithm similar to Quicksort. Our main result is an n(log n) O(1) -time deterministic algorithm, based on expander graphs, for matching the bolts and the nuts. y Department of Mathematics, Raymond and Beverly Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel and AT & T Bell Labs, Murray Hill, NJ 07974, USA. e-mail: noga@math.tau.ac.il.

Reference-contexts: It is worth noting that since we applied expanders of polylogarith-mic degrees there are simpler explicit constructions than those given in [10] and [11] and we can take appropriate Cayley graphs of the groups Z k 2 by applying some known constructions of Linear Error Correcting Codes, as described in <ref> [6] </ref>. This gives somewhat simpler graphs at the cost of increasing the complexity by a polylogarithmic factor. We omit the details. It is conceivable that using the techniques of this paper one can get an O (n log 2 n) algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Repeating in this manner yields an algorithm whose expected running time can be analyzed by imitating the known analysis for Quicksort (see, e.g., <ref> [8] </ref>) showing that it is fi (n log n). Moreover, it is easy to modify the above algorithm and make sure that the probability its running time will considerably exceed its expectation will be exponentially small. Deterministic algorithms seem more difficult to find.

Reference-contexts: We can think of two problems where our deterministic sampling methods may be helpful: one is local sorting where the goal is to answer all the the relationships between elements who are neighbors in a given graph. An optimal probabilistic algorithm is known <ref> [9] </ref>. The other problem is selection where the input is stored in a read only memroy and there is also some small read/write memory [12].

Reference-contexts: The answer to each such query is either b i &gt; s j or b i = s j or b i &lt; s j . The nuts and bolts matching problem is first mentioned as an exercise in <ref> [14] </ref>, page 293. There is a simple randomized algorithm along the lines of Quicksort for this problem and this solution is described later in this section.
