Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction and Motivation We describe the Multi-Agent Schedule Calendar (MASC) learning system that assists a user in scheduling meetings. This work is inspired by Maes and Kozierok <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref> and Mitchell et al. [4].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction and Motivation We describe the Multi-Agent Schedule Calendar (MASC) learning system that assists a user in scheduling meetings. This work is inspired by Maes and Kozierok <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref> and Mitchell et al. [4]. <p> The AA monitors the incoming mailbox and decides whether a meeting can be scheduled based on the learning algorithm, and if not, communicates with other users' AAs to coordinate a mutually acceptable time. The learning algorithm is an adaptation of the Maes-Kozierok (MK) <ref> [2] </ref> memory-based approach that stores a list of past situations to reason and predict the outcome of new ones. A situation is a set of features (i.e., name of requester, subject, participants, etc.) associated with a meeting request mail message, and an assignment of values to those features. <p> A situation is a set of features (i.e., name of requester, subject, participants, etc.) associated with a meeting request mail message, and an assignment of values to those features. MASC decides what action to take based on these stored situations. 2 The Maes-Kozierok Algorithm Maes and Kozierok <ref> [2] </ref> use an approach that computes distances between the old situations and the current one, adapted from [5].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction and Motivation We describe the Multi-Agent Schedule Calendar (MASC) learning system that assists a user in scheduling meetings. This work is inspired by Maes and Kozierok [1, 2, 3] and Mitchell et al. <ref> [4] </ref>. Our contributions are as follows: (a) we show how memory-based learning can be sped up by maintaining aggregate information; (b) we present an architecture for building personal agents organized around a division of labor between the learning and non-learning components of the system.
