Reference-contexts: We are currently exploring these issues and working on incorporating our Visitor-Hoster system with other software agents available at CMU, particularly, a calendar management agent CAP <ref> [DBM + 92] </ref> and an E-mail task apprentice agent to tackle the broaden problem of software agent architecture. We are also planning to apply our system into real-world everyday use. 5 Acknowledgments This research has been sponsored in part by ARPA Grant F33615-93-1-1330.

Reference-contexts: Third, the task of organizing a visit does not really involve any deep specialized knowledge, which makes this application domain to be a good illustrative example for agent-based architectures. A different variation of the hosting visitor task has also been explored by Kautz and his colleagues at Bell Labs <ref> [KSC94] </ref>. A visitor hosting agent should have the following capabilities: * It should automate information retrievals in terms of finding personnel information of potential meeting attendees. It should be able to access various on-line public databases and information resources at the disposal of the visit organizer.
