Abstract: This paper presents a motivational system for an autonomous robot which is designed to regulate human-robot interaction. The mode of social interaction is that of a caretaker-infant dyad where a human acts as the caretaker for the robot. The robot's motivational system is designed to generate an analogous interaction for a robot-human dyad as for an infant-caretaker dyad. An infant's emotions and drives play a very important role in generating meaningful interactions with the caretaker (Bullowa 1979). Similarly, the learning task for the robot is to apply various communication skills acquired during social exchanges to manipulate the caretaker such that its drives are satisfied. Toward this goal, the motivational system implements drives, emotions, and facial expressions. The interaction is regulated specifically to promote a suitable learning environment. Although the details of the learning itself are beyond the scope of this paper, this work represents an important step toward realizing robots that can engage in meaningful bi-directional social interactions with humans.

Reference-contexts: Introduction We want to build robots that engage in meaningful social exchanges with humans. In contrast to current work in robotics that focus on robot-robot interactions <ref> (Billard & Dautenhahn 1997) </ref>, this work concentrates on human-robot interactions. By doing so, it is possible to have a socially sophisticated human assist the robot in acquiring more sophicticated communication skills and help it learn the meaning these acts have for others.

Reference-contexts: The context for learning involves social exchanges where the robot learns how to manipulate the caretaker into satisfying its internal drives. An infant's emotions and drives play an important role in generating meaningful interactions with the caretaker <ref> (Bullowa 1979) </ref>. These interactions constitute learning episodes for new communication behaviors. In particular, the infant is strongly biased to learn communication skills that result in having the caretaker satisfy the infant's drives (Halliday 1975). <p> The mother reinforces the shared meaning of the cries by responding in consistant ways to their subtle variations. That mother-infant pairs develop communication protocols different from those of others is evidence of this phenomena <ref> (Bullowa 1979) </ref>. The preceding paragraphs have demonstrated that motivations should play a significant role in determining the robot's behavior, how it interacts with the caretaker, and what it can learn during social exchanges. <p> A similar behavior is observed in infants. When they are in extreme distress, perhaps throwing a tantrum, they may fall into a disturbed sleep. This is a self regulation tactic they use in extreme cases <ref> (Bullowa 1979) </ref>. Three of the four consummatory behaviors cannot be activated by the intensity of the drive alone. Instead, they require a special sort of environmental interaction to become active. For instance, Play with People cannot become active without the participation of a person.

Reference-contexts: Many experiments in developmental psychology have shown that infants show suprise when witnessing an unexpected or novel outcome to a familiar event <ref> (Carey & Gelman 1991) </ref>. Furthermore, parents use their infant's display of excitement or interest as cues to regulate their interaction with them (Wood et al. 1976). In humans, four factors serve to elicit emotions, i.e. neurochemical, sensorimotor, motivational, and cognitive (Izard 1993).

Reference-contexts: The emotions also play an important role in learning during face to face exchanges with the caretaker, but we leave the details of this to another paper. The organization and operation of the emotion subsystem is strongly inspired by various theories of emotions in humans <ref> (Ekman & Davidson 1994) </ref>, (Izard 1993), (LeDoux 1996), and most closely resembles the framework presented in (Velasquez 1996). The robot has several emotion processes. Although they are quite different from emotions in humans, they are designed to be rough analogs | especially with respect to the accompanying facial expressions.

Reference-contexts: Facial Expressions: For each emotion there is an accompanying facial expression. These are implemented in the motor system among various motor processes. The robot's facial features move analgously to how humans adjust their facial features to express different emotions <ref> (Ekman & Friesen 1978) </ref>, and the robot's ears move analogously to how dogs to move theirs to express motivational state (Milani 1986). Design of the Motivational System The robot's motivational system is composed of three inter-related subsystems.

In particular, the infant is strongly biased to learn communication skills that result in having the caretaker satisfy the infant's drives <ref> (Halliday 1975) </ref>. The infant's emotional responses provide important cues which the caretaker uses to assess how to satiate the infant's drives, and how to carefully regulate the complexity of the interaction.

Reference-contexts: Behavior Selection: In ethology, much of the work in motivation theory tries to explain how animals engage in appropriate behaviors at the appropriate time to promote survival (Tinbergen 1951), <ref> (Lorenz 1973) </ref>. For animals, internal drives influence which behavior the animal pursues, i.e., feeding, foraging, et cetera. Furthermore, depending on the intensity of the drives, the same sensory stimulus may result in very different behavior. <p> Third, they provide a learning context the robot learns skills that serve to satisfy its drives. The design of the robot's drive subsystem is heavily inspired by ethological views <ref> (Lorenz 1973) </ref>, (Tin-bergen 1951). One distinguishing feature of drives is their temporally cyclic behavior. That is, given no stimulation, a drive will tend to increase in intensity unless it is satiated. For instance, an animal's hunger level or need to sleep follows a cyclical pattern.

Reference-contexts: Computational Substrate: The overall system is implemented as an agent-based architecture similar to that of (Blumberg 1996) and <ref> (Maes 1990) </ref>. For this implementation, the basic computational process is modeled as a transducer. Its activation energy x is computed by the equation: x = ( P j=1 teger values of inputs i j , weights w j , bias b where n is the number of inputs. <p> Active units also pass some of their activation energy to the units connected to them. This is called spreading activation and is a mechanism by which units can influence the activation or suppression of other units <ref> (Maes 1990) </ref>. Groups of connected networks form subsystems. Typically, the units comprising each subsystem are specially tailored to perform computation for that subsystem. Hence, behavior units, drive units, emotion units, motor units, percept units, etc. differ somewhat in function although they all follow the basic transducer model.

The overall framework of the emotion system shares strong commonality with that of <ref> (Velasquez 1996) </ref>, although its function is specifically targeted for social exchanges and learning. Of the robot's emotions, anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness are analogs of the primary emotions in humans.

Reference-contexts: scaffolding involves reducing distractions, marking the task's critical attributes, reducing the number of degrees of freedom in the target task, and enabling the subject to experience the end or outcome of a sequence of activity before the infant is cognitively or physically able of seeking and attaining it for himself <ref> (Wood, Bruner & Ross 1976) </ref>. The emotive cues the parent receives during social exchanges serves as feedback so the parent can adjust the nature and intensity of the structured learning episode to maintain a suitable learning environment where the infant is neither bored or over-whelmed. <p> Many experiments in developmental psychology have shown that infants show suprise when witnessing an unexpected or novel outcome to a familiar event (Carey & Gelman 1991).
