Abstract: TCP protocol has been designed and tuned to perform well on wired network where the packet loss is mainly due to congestion. On heterogeneous networks where some links can be wireless, this assumption is no more valid. In this paper, we propose a mechanism which takes advantage of link level retransmissions on wireless link while avoiding interference between link level and TCP retransmissions. The idea is to delay the third and subsequent duplicate acknowledgements for some time, during which the packet may reach receiver wireless host due to local link level retransmissions. In case of packet losses due to corruptions on wireless links, delayed dupack scheme may avoid fl This report is revised version of the report released on end2end-interest email list on December 27, 1997. y Research reported is supported in part by Texas Advanced Technology Program grants 009741-052-C and 010115-248-C.

Reference-contexts: This process is continued until the expected ack is received, or number of retransmissions exceeds a threshold. Link-level retransmissions provide higher link-level reliability; which benefits all types of traffic, TCP and non-TCP. Unfortunately, link-level retransmissions interfere with re-transmissions by the TCP sender <ref> [3] </ref>. Therefore, researchers have developed several schemes to allow so-called "local recovery" (essentially consisting of retransmissions from the base station) that do not interfere with TCP's retransmission mechanism. 2 In this paper, we present a new and much simpler scheme to improve performance of TCP using wireless link-level retransmissions. <p> In either case, the sender will also retransmit the lost packet, leading to the so-called "interference" phenomenon.

ELNR message is similar to the Explicit Loss Notification (ELN) previously proposed <ref> [3] </ref>. The crucial difference is that, in the previous proposal, ELN was sent to the sender, whereas we propose that ELNR be sent to the receiver.

Hence in these two cases local link level 8 retransmissions are sufficient, and our scheme is not needed. Also note that other schemes like Snoop <ref> [4] </ref> are also not needed. It is the case C, where only local link level retransmissions are not sufficient as the interference (between local recovery and TCP retransmissions) and unnecessarily invocation of congestion control at TCP sender, may degrade the performance. <p> It is the case C, where only local link level retransmissions are not sufficient as the interference (between local recovery and TCP retransmissions) and unnecessarily invocation of congestion control at TCP sender, may degrade the performance. In this case, one needs mechanisms such as dupack hiding <ref> [4] </ref>, delayed dupack to achieve better performance. 6 Refinements and Variations over Basic Scheme 6.1 Determining Relative Error Rate As noted previously, optimal value of ffi is a function of the relationship between congestion losses and error losses.

Reference-contexts: This is known as the fast retransmit mechanism <ref> [6] </ref>. When the packet is lost on wireless link, retransmissions from FH (which may be far away from MH) wastes the bandwidth on wired links.

Reference-contexts: This situation can occur, for instance, when a satellite downlink is being used to send data to a receiver (as in DirecPC <ref> [8] </ref>), whereas acks are sent over land-based channels. In this situation, the forward and reverse paths may, potentially, not have any nodes in common (except sender and receiver).
