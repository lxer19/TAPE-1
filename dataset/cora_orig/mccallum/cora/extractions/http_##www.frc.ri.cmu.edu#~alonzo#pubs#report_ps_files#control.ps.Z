Reference-contexts: Both navigators are based on the Highly Mobile Multi-Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV). The performance of the both prototypes has been promising when compared with that of previous systems. Both systems are based on the ERIM laser rangefinder. The first system <ref> [7] </ref> is similar in concept to the ALV. It generates a complete geometric description of the terrain in cartesian coordinates by transforming successive range images. It evaluates candidate vehicle trajectories by simulating the vehicle state forward in time in order to predict collisions.

Reference-contexts: The list is not exhaustive, nor is it a complete discussion of each system provided. Unfortunately, little has been published to date on some systems, and available publications do not address some of the issues investigated here. 1.4.1 Hughes ALV The Hughes Autonomous Land Vehicle <ref> [9] </ref> was one of the first off-road mobile robots ever developed. The system generalized the notion of an obstacle to include any vehicle configuration that is unsafe. This allowed navigation over terrain of any surface shape.

Reference-contexts: It differs from its predecessor in its adaptive perception algorithms, the efficiency of its admissability module, its universal 3D models, and it favors a controls feedforward approach over the cluttered environment search based planner. More recently, a second group <ref> [18] </ref> have developed a system called Ganesha which processes range images to recover regions of constant terrain gradient. This system has achieved runs over distances of 840 meters, at speeds of 2-3 m/s while avoiding natural obstacles, and it has probably exceeded these results as of this writing.
