Title: Abstract  
Abstract: With the advent of new and proposed experiment facilities in the U.S. (BNL/AGS and RHIC) and elsewhere (CERN/SPS and LHC), the relativistic nuclear physics has become one of the top national priorities in nuclear physics research. We propose a new research program toward the understanding of the phenomenology of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Our focus is to investigate the quark-gluon substructure of nuclear matter and the possibility of quark-gluon plasma formation. We have planned an extended and rigorous research program to analyze and understand experimental data, to find a promising and reliable set of signatures for the phase transition, and predict new results from fundamental theories. The following research directions and topics have been suggested to carry out the program: Heavy quark production at RHIC and LHC, Nuclear gluon structure function at small x, Disoriented chiral condensate, U (1) A particle production, Electromagnetic probe (dilepton production), QCD-based Effective field theory of multiparticle production, Wavelet analysis of multiparticle correlations, and Rapidity gaps.

Reference-contexts: Recently, open charm production in heavy-ion collisions has been proposed as an elegant method for probing the possible formation of the quark-gluon plasma <ref> [4] </ref>. However, in order to determine whether the enchanced charm production at RHIC can be unambiguously interpreted as a signal of QGP, one needs to have control of the other sources of charm production. The standard competing process is charm production through the hard collisions 1 2 Chapter 1. <p> This result seems to indicate that the initial temperature of the quark-gluon plasma formed in Au-Au collisions at RHIC would need to be unrealistically high <ref> [4] </ref> to overcome the QCD background. However, further theoretical and experimental work is needed in better understanding of the nuclear shadowing effects on the gluon density, before definite conclusion can be made. We discuss this problem in details in Section 2.2.

Reference-contexts: 1.1.1 Charm Quark Pair Production to O (ff 3 Recently we have completed the calculation of the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of inclusive charm quark production in p-p and Au-Au collisions at RHIC and LHC, including the O (ff 3 s ) radiative corrections and the nuclear shadowing effect <ref> [5] </ref>. In perturbative QCD differential inclusive distribution of charm production in nuclear collisions is obtained by convolution of parton densities in nuclei with a hard scattering parton cross section. <p> For central Au-Au collisions at RHIC (LHC) we get about 4 (40) charm quark pairs produced per event <ref> [5] </ref>. To summarize, we have calculated the complete next-to-leading order differential and total inclusive cross sections for the charm production in hadronic and nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC energies [5,14]. We have shown that both higher-order contributions and the nuclear shadowing effect are large and can not be neglected.

The standard competing process is charm production through the hard collisions 1 2 Chapter 1. <p> This result seems to indicate that the initial temperature of the quark-gluon plasma formed in Au-Au collisions at RHIC would need to be unrealistically high <ref> [4] </ref> to overcome the QCD background. However, further theoretical and experimental work is needed in better understanding of the nuclear shadowing effects on the gluon density, before definite conclusion can be made. We discuss this problem in details in Section 2.2.

Reference-contexts: Sarcevic and P. Valerio) The main goal of the future heavy-ion colliders, such as RHIC and LHC, is to study the properties of nuclear matter under extreme conditions, and in particular to search for the formation of a new state of matter, the quark-gluon plasma <ref> [1] </ref>. With the assumption that high energy nuclear collisions lead to the thermalized system, RHIC and LHC energies are sufficiently large to produce very dense matter, of the order of several GeV/f m 3 , well above the critical density necessary to create the quark-gluon plasma [2].

Reference-contexts: 1.1.1 Charm Quark Pair Production to O (ff 3 Recently we have completed the calculation of the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of inclusive charm quark production in p-p and Au-Au collisions at RHIC and LHC, including the O (ff 3 s ) radiative corrections and the nuclear shadowing effect <ref> [5] </ref>. In perturbative QCD differential inclusive distribution of charm production in nuclear collisions is obtained by convolution of parton densities in nuclei with a hard scattering parton cross section. <p> For central Au-Au collisions at RHIC (LHC) we get about 4 (40) charm quark pairs produced per event <ref> [5] </ref>. To summarize, we have calculated the complete next-to-leading order differential and total inclusive cross sections for the charm production in hadronic and nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC energies [5,14]. We have shown that both higher-order contributions and the nuclear shadowing effect are large and can not be neglected.
