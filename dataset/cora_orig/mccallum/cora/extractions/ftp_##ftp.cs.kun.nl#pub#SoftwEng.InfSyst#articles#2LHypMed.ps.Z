Abstract: Published as: P.D. Bruza and Th.P. van der Weide. Two Level Hypermedia An Improved Architecture for Hypertext. In A.M. Tjoa and R. Wagner, editors, Proceedings of the Data Base and Expert System Applications Conference (DEXA 90), pages 76-83, Wenen, Austria, 1990. Springer-Verlag. Abstract In this article we present the Two Level Hypermedia architecture. Both levels of this architecture are detailed in the framework of a conceptual model of hypermedia. A central aspect of this model is the notion of a view. The concept of a hyperindex is introduced, which is a novel approach to organizing indexing information relevant for hypermedia. In conjunction with the hyperindex, the notion of Query by Navigation (QBN) is introduced.

Reference-contexts: A typical example of a characterization is a set of keywords or terms. There are other possibilities such as trigrams [TS88] or index expressions. For a detailed exposition of index expressions see <ref> [Bru90] </ref>. In the model of figure 6 the characterizations, denoted as C, are presented as a special sort of fragment. The characterizations form the basis of the hyperindex. Each fragment can have associated zero or more characterizations. This is modelled by the relation describes in figure 6.

It is this structure that supports Query By Navigation. The construction of the hyperindex is as follows.

Reference-contexts: At this point we introduce some terminology. The term title refers to a particular hypermedia application.

Reference-contexts: This paper focuses on the question as to what can be done to help the user to re-orient when they become lost. In current hypermedia systems orientation is facilitated by mechanisms such as a browser or a book-mark <ref> [Con87] </ref> [SK89]. A browser is essentially a map of the hypermedia in which the current position of the user is marked. A book-mark is a place marker in the hypermedia to which the user can return after following a side-track.

Reference-contexts: Several approaches can be recognized; in <ref> [Gar88] </ref> for example, a model of hypermedia is presented using first-order logic. In [Tom89] hypermedia is modelled in terms of hypergraphs. We take a different approach, and consider hypermedia as more than just a way of presenting the underlying information (this is also recognized in [Sal89]).

Reference-contexts: It is also advantageous that both levels are expressed in terms of the same underlying model, namely hypermedia. The user can thus deal with the system in a uniform way. The two level structure is a natural extension of the lattice-based model of information retrieval presented in <ref> [GGP89] </ref>. This model consists of a lattice of index entries built on a document set. The user interacts with the system essentially by walking over the lattice. A node in the lattice represents a query. The query can be refined or enlarged by moving to descendant or ancestor nodes respectively.

Reference-contexts: We take the opposite approach, and define the conceptual model, without the introduction of a description language. For practical reasons however, SGML-based documents are easily mapped into the format of our conceptual model. A simple transducer will suffice for this. schema in the NIAM notation (see <ref> [Gri82] </ref>). On the basis of this schema we will discuss the various components of the model.

We take a different approach, and consider hypermedia as more than just a way of presenting the underlying information (this is also recognized in <ref> [Sal89] </ref>). In our approach of hypermedia, we have a clean separation between the structure of the information, the presentation of the information, and the information elements themselves (the fragments). At this point we introduce some terminology. The term title refers to a particular hypermedia application.

Reference-contexts: Hypertext refers to text-only hypermedia. a This work has been partially supported by the ESPRIT project APPED (2499). 1 There are however some problems. One of the most important problems is what is usually referred to as being lost in hyperspace <ref> [SK89] </ref>. This problem can be introduced by the analogy of the child who, walking home through the forest, sees a butterfly and starts chasing it, which leads him further and further from the original path, until he stops and realizes he is lost. <p> This paper focuses on the question as to what can be done to help the user to re-orient when they become lost. In current hypermedia systems orientation is facilitated by mechanisms such as a browser or a book-mark [Con87] <ref> [SK89] </ref>. A browser is essentially a map of the hypermedia in which the current position of the user is marked. A book-mark is a place marker in the hypermedia to which the user can return after following a side-track.

Reference-contexts: Note that the quality of the retrieval is heavily dependent on how good the characterization describes the associated object. A typical example of a characterization is a set of keywords or terms. There are other possibilities such as trigrams <ref> [TS88] </ref> or index expressions. For a detailed exposition of index expressions see [Bru90]. In the model of figure 6 the characterizations, denoted as C, are presented as a special sort of fragment.
