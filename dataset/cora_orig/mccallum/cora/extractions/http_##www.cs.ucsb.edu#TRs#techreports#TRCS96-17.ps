Author: Teofilo F. Gonzalez 
Address: Santa Barbara, CA, 93106  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of California,  
Abstract: This paper has all the proofs for Gonzalez' paper entitled "Improved Approximation Algorithms for Multimessage Multicasting" by T. Gonzalez [1]. One set of proofs are "hand proofs" and the other set is by a Mathematica program. The Mathematica proofs can also be found in http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~teo.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the following sections we include all the proofs for the lemmas in "Improved Approximation Algorithms for Multimessage Multicasting" by T. Gonzalez. 2 Proofs for Lemmas 2.1 - 2.5 2.1 "Hand" Proofs for Lemmas 2.1 - 2.5 These proofs also appear in <ref> [1] </ref>. They are included here for completeness. Lemma 2.1 For the set of values Procedure Coloring is defined L R. <p> These macros print errors when invalid operations are attempted, and will also print conditions under which the operations performed are valid ones. It is simple to verify that all these conditions hold for the values for which procedure Coloring is defined <ref> [1] </ref>. The proofs are of the following form. We start with an expression and transform it to another expression, such that the first expression holds if and only if the second expression holds. We keep on performing these operations until we get an expression that is trivially true. <p> ] HOLDS THE RESULTING EXPRESSION IS [ 0 GreaterEqual 0 ] THAT EVALUATES TO True Therefore, the expression holds for Case 2 This completes the proof of Lemma 2.5 27 3 Proofs for Lemmas 3.1 - 3.5 3.1 "Hand" Proofs for Lemmas 3.1 - 3.5 These proofs also appear in <ref> [1] </ref>.
