Title: Internet Engineering Task Force AVT WG  
Author: INTERNET-DRAFT Schulzrinne 
Note: RTP Payload for DTMF Digits Status of this Memo This document is an Internet-Draft. Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Note that other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts. Distribution of this document is unlimited. This memo describes how to carry dual-tone multifrequency (DTMF) signaling in RTP packets.  
Date: July 8, 1997 Expires: December 1, 1997

Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as work in progress. To learn the current status of any Internet-Draft, please check the 1id-abstracts.txt listing contained in the Internet-Drafts Shadow Directories on ftp.is.co.za (Africa), nic.nordu.net (Europe), munnari.oz.au (Pacific Rim), ds.internic.net (US East Coast), or ftp.isi.edu (US West Coast).

Reference-contexts: The default clock frequency is 8000 Hz, but the clock frequency can be redefined when assigning the dynamic payload type. This format achieves a higher redundancy even in the case of sustained packet loss than the method proposed for the Voice over Frame Relay Implementation Agreement <ref> [1] </ref>. In circumstances where exact timing alignment between the audio stream and the DTMF digits is not important and data is sent unicast, such as the IVR example mentioned earlier, it may be preferable to use a reliable control stream such as H.245.

Reference-contexts: Since some tones are two seconds long, this would incur a substantial delay. Schulzrinne Expires December 1, 1997 [Page 2] INTERNET-DRAFT draft-ietf-avt-dtmf-00.ps July 8, 1997 3 Reliability To achieve reliability even when the network loses packets, the audio redundancy mechanism described in <ref> [2] </ref> is used. The effective data rate is r times 64 bits (32 bits for the redundancy header and 32 bits for the DTMF payload) every 50 ms or r times 1280 bits/second, where r is the number of redundant DTMF digits carried in each packet.
