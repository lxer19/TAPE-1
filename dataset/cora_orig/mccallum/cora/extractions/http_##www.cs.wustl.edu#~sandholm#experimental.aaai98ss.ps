Title: Contract Types for Satisficing Task Allocation:  
Abstract: II Experimental Results Abstract We provide experimental results for a task allocation problem where self-interested, individually rational agents (re)contract tasks among themselves. Traditional contract types allow only one task to be transferred between agents at a time (original contracts). In this paper the original and four other contract types are studied: cluster-, swap-, multiagent, and OCSM-contracts. The OCSM-contracts will reach the global optimum even if the agents are individually rational, but in large-scale problems the number of steps required can be prohibitively large, albeit finite. In such cases it is more important to find the best solution reachable in a bounded amount of time. To construct algorithms that achieve that we study different contract types evaluate their performance. This paper discusses the quality of local optima reached by the different contract types, and how quickly they are reached. It is shown how environmental characteristics such as the number of agents and the number of tasks affect these results. This analysis is used as a basis for making prescriptions about which contract types agents should use in different environments. Out of original-, cluster-, swap-, and multiagent-contracts, either original-contracts (if the ratio agents to tasks is great) or cluster-contracts (if the same ratio is small) reach a local optimum with a higher social welfare than the others.

The gray areas represent results that are not significant at the 0.05 level, yet one of the contracts is better. In the dark gray areas the latter contract is better while in the lighter gray areas the former is better.

The outcome 5 A more detailed discussion of these new contract types, and the exact definitions of the contracts used in this contracting approach can be found in <ref> (Sandholm 1997a) </ref>. of the system is the social welfare, i.e., the negative of the sum of all the agents' costs. Initially the location of the cities and starting points of the salesmen are chosen randomly as is each salesman's initial assignment of cities to visit.
