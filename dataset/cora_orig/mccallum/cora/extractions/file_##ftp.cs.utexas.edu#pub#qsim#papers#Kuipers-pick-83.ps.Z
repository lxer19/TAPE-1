Abstract: Could the human cognitive map, with all of its peculiarities, be structured in any other way and still perform the useful functions it does? We can perform a thought-experiment by imagining that we must design the cognitive map for a robot, operating under limited cognitive resources, which must assimilate and use knowledge about its large-scale environment acquired from observations during travel. By taking this design perspective, we can determine that some familiar proposals for the structure of the cognitive map are inadequate, by themselves, to meet the constraints of the task. We develop a design consisting of separate representations for relative-position information, topological connections, and knowledge of routes, each rich in states of partial knowledge. Each step of the derivation is motivated by the pragmatic needs of the task, and the result bears a strong resemblance to the human cognitive map. We also discuss the relationship between this type of argument from design and the more usual approach of When we observe the peculiarities of the human cognitive map, we are tempted to ask, "Could it have been any other way?" We can conduct psychological explanation.

Reference-contexts: Although this is a very good design for our robot's cognitive map, and illustrates the design requirements underlying several features of the human cognitive map <ref> (cf. Kuipers, 1978, 1979b) </ref>, it is not yet sufficiently well- specified. We have implicitly assumed that our creature is somehow provided with knowledge of places, and that observations provide relations between them. This is not the case.

Reference-contexts: An observer's knowledge of the world is necessarily partial. If, for example, our robot were to travel from a familiar area to another Kuipers, The Cognitive Map, 1983 4 area it then learned in some detail, interruptions, the limits of its perceptual abilities, and other cognitive resource limitations <ref> (Norman & Bobrow, 1975) </ref> could prevent it from maintaining its orientation accurately between the two areas. Limited to a 2-D analog representation, the robot is compelled to draw the two areas in some well-defined though probably incorrect relation to each other. This has several problems for the unfortunate robot.
