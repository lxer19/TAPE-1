Abstract: The inability of diagnostic ultrasound to detect low contrast lesions deep inside the body has limited its success in cancer diagnosis. To enhance low contrast detectability, two-dimensional, very large arrays (VLA's) providing greatly improved spatial resolution have been proposed. Due to discontinuous acoustic windows into the body, however, a significant fraction of such an array might be blocked resulting in degraded detectability in clinical situations. To compensate for this degradation, an object dependent method utilizing multiple receive beams has been proposed and shown to effectively reduce undesired beamforming artifacts. To further explore the method's capabilities, simulations have been done quantifying improvements in contrast resolution. Using the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) as a performance measure, results show that low contrast detectability is determined by sidelobe energy in the point spread function if the total aperture size is not reduced. Moreover, contrast resolution can be restored using the object dependent method if the number of blocked elements is not very significant. If the number of blocked elements is large, however, the method breaks down and performance improvements are minimal. Key words: Blocked element compensation; contrast resolution; detectability; multiple re ceive beamforming; very large array.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION Detecting low contrast lesions embedded in similar backgrounds is an essential task of all medical imaging modalities. In diagnostic ultrasound, it has been shown that one of the primary limitations on low contrast detectability is image speckle <ref> [1] </ref>. Speckle results from coherent interference of scatterers (i.e., linear summation by the transducer of echoes from scatterers) in a finite resolution volume. Its granular structure masks image details and therefore limits detectability. Several techniques, such as frequency and spatial compounding, have long been explored to reduce speckle variance [2-6].

Reference-contexts: In other words, only large size apertures can greatly improve the detectability of small objects in tissue. Several types of large, two-dimensional arrays have been proposed. First, fully sampled two-dimensional arrays capable of steering in both azimuth and elevation can be used for real-time, three-dimensional imaging <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. The major drawback, however, is the hardware complexity and complicated interconnect problem created by the large number of channels. Second, two-dimensional sparse arrays have been proposed to reduce the complexity of fully sampled two-dimensional arrays while avoiding unwanted grating lobes [9].

Finally, anisotropic arrays have been investigated to reduce the number of channels by undersampling the aperture in elevation. Such arrays are also referred to as 1.5 dimensional arrays <ref> [10] </ref>. Anisotropic arrays are not suitable for real-time, three-dimensional imaging due to the limitation of beam steering in the elevational direction. Nevertheless, they can be used to correct for beamforming artifacts associated with a large aperture size and greatly improve image quality of two-dimensional images. <p> There are two major problems associated with large arrays. One is phase aberration due to spatial inhomogeneities in the propagation medium [11-16]. Adaptive imaging systems using anisotropic arrays have been proposed to overcome the lack of phase coherence over large areas of the body <ref> [10] </ref>. On the other hand, due to the discontinuous acoustic windows 2 into the body, a significant portion of the array is likely to be blocked in clinical situations if the aperture size is large. This results in the second major problem: blocked elements.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, enhancement of low contrast detectability using VLA's cannot be achieved unless a proper compensation algorithm for blocked element artifacts is applied. A method of overcoming beamforming artifacts in the presence of blocked elements has been described in <ref> [17] </ref>. This method uses multiple receive beams to estimate and remove undesired sidelobe contributions for each transmit beam of a sector scan in the presence of blocked elements. In this paper, we quantify improvements in detectability resulting from compensation. <p> In the next section, we study the factors affecting contrast resolution based on the statistics of integrated speckle patterns [19-23]. Degradation in contrast resolution due to blocked array elements is discussed in section 3. An object dependent compensation algorithm is briefly described in section 4 <ref> [17] </ref>. Note that although the blocked element problem is more pronounced in two-dimensional arrays, one-dimensional structures will be used exclusively throughout this paper for simplicity. Nevertheless, it is clear that the same principles apply to both one- and two-dimensional cases as noted in [17]. <p> algorithm is briefly described in section 4 <ref> [17] </ref>. Note that although the blocked element problem is more pronounced in two-dimensional arrays, one-dimensional structures will be used exclusively throughout this paper for simplicity. Nevertheless, it is clear that the same principles apply to both one- and two-dimensional cases as noted in [17]. Performance of the compensation algorithm on low contrast detectability is presented in section 5. 3 2 DETECTABILITY Detectability of a lesion in a noisy background is determined by local contrast and the statistics of the system [18]. <p> The solid line is with no blocked elements and the dashed line is with 40 blocked elements (5-12, 17-28, 33-44 and 53-60). Since blocked elements do not change range response <ref> [17] </ref>, these correlation functions are computed only in the lateral direction. Clearly, mainlobes of the autocorrelation functions have comparable widths. <p> Hence, discriminating between different tissue types is necessary. A point-wise, acoustic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), defined as the ratio of mean to standard deviation of the envelope of the scattered signal, is therefore used for this purpose. As shown in <ref> [17] </ref>, the acoustic SNR's in anechoic regions obtained directly from multiple receive beams show similar trends to the SNR's obtained using larger regions. It was further shown that they are considerably higher than the value for fully developed speckle noise where the theoretical value is 1.91 for a Rayleigh distribution. <p> The compensated signal along the transmit beam direction is, therefore, x compensated p = x p x undesired p . (20) For the details of this method, please refer to <ref> [17] </ref>. 5 BLOCKED ELEMENT COMPENSATION AND CONTRAST-TO-NOISE RATIO As described previously, the object-dependent approach utilizes multiple receive beams to estimate and remove undesired sidelobe contributions. To simulate multiple receive beam-forming, the target pattern is first weighted by the transmit beam pattern centered at the transmit direction.
