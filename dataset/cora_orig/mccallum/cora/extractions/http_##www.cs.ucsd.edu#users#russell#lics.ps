Title: Upper and Lower Bounds for Tree-like Cutting Planes Proofs

Abstract: In this paper we study the complexity of Cutting Planes (CP) refutations, and tree-like CP refutations. Tree-like CP proofs are natural and still quite powerful. In particular, the propositional pigeonhole principle (PHP) has been shown to have polynomial-sized tree-like CP proofs. Our main result shows that a family of tautologies, introduced in this paper requires exponential-sized tree-like CP proofs. We obtain this result by introducing a new method which relates the size of a CP refutation to the complexity of a related search problem. Because these tautologies have polynomial-sized Frege proofs, it follows that tree-like CP cannot polyno-mially simulate Frege systems.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we have shown (informally) that :M atch n reduces to the negation of the pigeonhole principle. The above argument can be formalized by polynomial-sized, bounded-depth Frege proofs and furthermore, Buss <ref> [B] </ref> has constructed polynomial-size Frege proofs for P HP ; therefore M atch n has polynomial-sized Frege proofs. Thus we have the following corollary to Theorem 6. Corollary 7: Tree-like Cutting Planes cannot p-simulate Frege systems. Moreover, tree-like Cutting Planes cannot p-simulate bounded-depth Frege+PHP.

Reference-contexts: The Cutting Planes system (CP) is a refutation system for propositional logic, based on showing that there are no integer solutions for a family of linear inequalities associated with an unsatisfiable propositional formula. This system was introduced in <ref> [CCT] </ref>, and shown to be a sound and complete proof system for all unsatisfiable formulas in conjunctive normal form. <p> Clearly, unrestricted Cutting Planes refutations are at least as powerful as tree-like refutations, and it is currently not known if they are more powerful. Tree-like Cutting Planes proofs are natural and non-trivial. In particular, the propositional pigeonhole principle (PHP) has been shown to have polynomial-sized tree-like CP proofs <ref> [CCT] </ref>. This tautology is important since almost all non-trivial lower bounds for size of proofs have used PHP as the family of hard examples. The main result of this paper is an exponential lower bound on the size of tree-like Cutting Planes proofs for certain tautologies. <p> Finally, we conclude in section 5 with open problems and conjectures concerning lower bounds for Cutting Planes and Frege systems. 2 Definitions and background 2.1 Cutting Planes proofs We first review the Cutting Planes (CP) refutation system. For a more complete treatment, see [C1], [G1], or <ref> [CCT] </ref>. Cutting Planes formulae are inequalities of the form a 1 x 1 + a 2 x 2 + :::a n x n A; where a i ; A 2 Z. <p> We would like to point out that it is sensible to count the number of formulas rather than the symbol size. (The symbol size of a proof is the sum of the sizes of all formulas in the proof.) It was shown in <ref> [CCT] </ref> that any CP proof can be converted into a new CP proof such that all of the coefficients in the new proof are polynomially bounded, and the number of formulas in the new proof is polynomial in the original number of formulas. <p> (We do not distinguish between tree-like Frege and Frege because they have been shown to be polyno-mially equivalent [K].) How does Cutting Planes compare with bounded-depth Frege systems? Recent exponential lower bounds for bounded-depth Frege proofs of PHP [BIK] combined with the upper bound for tree-like CP proofs of PHP <ref> [CCT] </ref> establish that bounded-depth Frege cannot p-simulate Cutting Planes or even tree-like Cutting Planes. Does CP p-simulate bounded-depth Frege systems? &gt;From circuit complexity, we know that the underlying formulas in a CP proof, polynomial-size depth-1 threshold formulas, cannot be computed by polynomial-size, constant-depth formulas. <p> this paper. (In fact, the only lower bound for CP that we know of, prior to this paper, is a lower bound on a restricted CP system, due to Goerdt [G2].) 2.2.1 Easy and Hard Examples As mentioned earlier, the canonical family of hard examples, PHP, has short CP proofs <ref> [CCT] </ref>. So we must first come up with new hard examples. In order to give the reader some intuition for Cutting Planes proofs, we will discuss several possibilities.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we conclude in section 5 with open problems and conjectures concerning lower bounds for Cutting Planes and Frege systems. 2 Definitions and background 2.1 Cutting Planes proofs We first review the Cutting Planes (CP) refutation system. For a more complete treatment, see [C1], <ref> [G1] </ref>, or [CCT]. Cutting Planes formulae are inequalities of the form a 1 x 1 + a 2 x 2 + :::a n x n A; where a i ; A 2 Z. <p> Moreover, there are polynomial-sized CP proofs of the propositional PHP, but Haken [H] has shown that Resolution proofs of PHP require exponential size. Thus, Resolution cannot p-simulate CP. It was shown in <ref> [G1] </ref> that any Cutting Planes proof can be p-simulated by a Frege proof. This result is not surprising because each formula in a CP refutation is just a depth-1 threshold formula, whereas any polynomial-sized formula may appear in a polynomial-sized Frege proof.

Reference-contexts: threshold formulas, there are no lower bounds known for Cutting Planes, or even for tree-like Cutting Planes proofs prior to this paper. (In fact, the only lower bound for CP that we know of, prior to this paper, is a lower bound on a restricted CP system, due to Goerdt <ref> [G2] </ref>.) 2.2.1 Easy and Hard Examples As mentioned earlier, the canonical family of hard examples, PHP, has short CP proofs [CCT].

Reference-contexts: How powerful are Cutting Planes and tree-like Cutting Planes proof systems? It is straightforward to verify that CP is a generalization of Resolution| i.e. any Resolution proof can be polynomially-simulated by CP. Moreover, there are polynomial-sized CP proofs of the propositional PHP, but Haken <ref> [H] </ref> has shown that Resolution proofs of PHP require exponential size. Thus, Resolution cannot p-simulate CP. It was shown in [G1] that any Cutting Planes proof can be p-simulated by a Frege proof.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, it can also be shown that treelike CP lies between tree-like Resolution and Frege. 2 (We do not distinguish between tree-like Frege and Frege because they have been shown to be polyno-mially equivalent <ref> [K] </ref>.) How does Cutting Planes compare with bounded-depth Frege systems?

Reference-contexts: Proof: We will argue informally that such proofs exist. Let G = (V; E) be a graph with no perfect matching, and assume :N P M n for G. By Tutte's theorem <ref> [LP, p. 84] </ref>, there is a set of vertices S V so that the set of odd components of G n S is larger than S. The proof proceeds in two steps. Let H be an odd component of G n S having 2m + 1 vertices.
