Reference-contexts: SDP bears a remarkable resemblance to LP. In fact, it is known that several interior-point methods for LP and their polynomial convergence analysis can be naturally extended to SDP (see Alizadeh <ref> [1] </ref>, Jarre [15], Nesterov and Nemirovskii [27, 28], Vandenberghe and Boyd [37]). However, in extending primal-dual interior-point methods from LP to SDP, certain choices have to be made and the resulting search direction depends on these choices.

Reference-contexts: They proved polynomial-time convergence of the path-following algorithm using this direction. So far, there seems to be no computational experience using it. 1.3 The AHO Direction Alizadeh, Haeberly, and Overton <ref> [2] </ref> proposed symmetrizing equation (5) by rewriting it as XZ + ZX = 0; (12) and then applying Newton's method to (3), (4) and (12).

Reference-contexts: It can also be easily seen that the optimal values of (17) and (18) coincide, that the optimal solutions satisfy strict complementarity, and that the problems are nondegenerate (see Muramatsu [26]; for degeneracy in SDP, see Alizadeh, Haeberly, and Overton <ref> [3] </ref>). In fact, this example problem was first proposed in Muramatsu [26] to prove that the primal affine-scaling algorithm fails. - 7 - 3 The HRVW/KSH/M direction In this section, we consider the long-step primal-dual affine-scaling algorithm using the HRVW/KSH/M direction.

Reference-contexts: In fact, a specific example was given by Todd, Toh and Tutuncu [34]. On the other hand, Alizadeh, Haeberly, and Overton <ref> [4] </ref> report that the path-following algorithm using the AHO direction has empirically better convergence properties than the one using the HRVW/KSH/M direction. 1.4 The NT Direction Nesterov and Todd [29, 30] proposed primal-dual algorithms for more general convex programming than SDP, which includes SDP as a special case.

Reference-contexts: The affine-scaling algorithm was originally proposed for LP by Dikin [8], and independently rediscovered by Barnes <ref> [5] </ref>, Vanderbei, Meketon and Freedman [38] and others, after Karmarkar [16] proposed the first polynomial-time interior-point method. Though polynomial-time complexity has not been proved yet for this algorithm, global convergence using so-called long steps was proved by Tsuchiya and Muramatsu [36].
Reference: [6] <author> B. Borchers. CSDP, </author> <title> a C library for semidefinite programming. </title> <type> Technical report, </type> <year> 1997. </year>
Reference-contexts: The HRVW/KSH/M direction is currently very popular for practical implementation because of its computational simplicity. Almost all SDP solvers have an option to use this direction, and some serious solvers (for example, Borchers <ref> [6] </ref> and Fujisawa and Kojima [11]) use this direction only. 1.2 The MT Direction Monteiro and Tsuchiya [24] apply Newton's method to the system obtained from (3)-(5) by replacing (5) with X 1=2 ZX 1=2 = 0: (9) The resulting direction is guaranteed to be symmetric.

Reference-contexts: For both primal-dual affine-scaling algorithms, de Klerk, Roos and Terlaky <ref> [7] </ref> proved polynomial-time convergence. However, as was mentioned before, there exist several different search directions in primal-dual interior-point methods for SDP, and each of the primal-dual affine-scaling algorithms studied by de Klerk, Roos and Terlaky was based on a certain specific choice of search direction. <p> Also, see the works of Monteiro and Zhang [25], Luo, Sturm and Zhang [20], and Sturm and Zhang [33] for some convergence properties of the algorithms using the NT direction. The primal-dual affine-scaling algorithm studied by de Klerk, Roos and Terlaky <ref> [7] </ref> was based on this direction. As for numerical computation, Todd, Toh and Tutuncu [34] reported that the path-following algorithm using the NT direction is more robust than algorithms based on the HRVW/KSH/M and AHO directions. 1.5 Notation and Organization The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: The AHO direction however, is not necessarily well-defined on the feasible region as observed by Shida, Shindoh and Kojima - 4 - [32]; the linear system (6), (7), and (13) can be inconsistent for some problems. In fact, a specific example was given by Todd, Toh and Tutuncu <ref> [34] </ref>. <p> The primal-dual affine-scaling algorithm studied by de Klerk, Roos and Terlaky [7] was based on this direction. As for numerical computation, Todd, Toh and Tutuncu <ref> [34] </ref> reported that the path-following algorithm using the NT direction is more robust than algorithms based on the HRVW/KSH/M and AHO directions. 1.5 Notation and Organization The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the specific SDP problem we wish to study. <p> It seems that the algorithm corresponding to the NT direction is more robust than those corresponding to the other directions. The same observation was reported by Todd, Toh and Tutuncu <ref> [34] </ref>. Acknowledgements We thank Professor Michael Overton of New York University for showing us the bad local behavior of the HRVW/KSH/M method, which motivated us to do this research. We also thank Dr.

Reference-contexts: The resulting direction is a solution of (6), (7) and Several convergence properties including polynomial-time convergence are known for the path-following algorithm using the AHO direction. See for example the work of Kojima, Shida and Shindoh [17], Monteiro [22], and Tseng <ref> [35] </ref>. The AHO direction however, is not necessarily well-defined on the feasible region as observed by Shida, Shindoh and Kojima - 4 - [32]; the linear system (6), (7), and (13) can be inconsistent for some problems.

Reference-contexts: Though polynomial-time complexity has not been proved yet for this algorithm, global convergence using so-called long steps was proved by Tsuchiya and Muramatsu <ref> [36] </ref>. This algorithm is often called the primal (or dual) affine-scaling algorithm because the algorithm is based on the primal (or dual) problem only. There is also a notion of primal-dual affine-scaling algorithm.

Reference-contexts: SDP bears a remarkable resemblance to LP. In fact, it is known that several interior-point methods for LP and their polynomial convergence analysis can be naturally extended to SDP (see Alizadeh [1], Jarre [15], Nesterov and Nemirovskii [27, 28], Vandenberghe and Boyd <ref> [37] </ref>). However, in extending primal-dual interior-point methods from LP to SDP, certain choices have to be made and the resulting search direction depends on these choices. As a result, there can be several search directions for SDP corresponding to a single search direction for LP.

Reference-contexts: The affine-scaling algorithm was originally proposed for LP by Dikin [8], and independently rediscovered by Barnes [5], Vanderbei, Meketon and Freedman <ref> [38] </ref> and others, after Karmarkar [16] proposed the first polynomial-time interior-point method. Though polynomial-time complexity has not been proved yet for this algorithm, global convergence using so-called long steps was proved by Tsuchiya and Muramatsu [36].

Reference-contexts: Polynomial-time convergence was proved for the path-following algorithms using this direction. For related work, see also the papers of Lin and Saigal [19], Potra and Sheng [31], and Zhang <ref> [39] </ref>. The HRVW/KSH/M direction is currently very popular for practical implementation because of its computational simplicity.
