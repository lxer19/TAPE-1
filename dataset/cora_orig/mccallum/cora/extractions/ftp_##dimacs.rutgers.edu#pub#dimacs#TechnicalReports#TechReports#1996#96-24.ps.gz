Reference-contexts: Given this (rather sad) state of affairs, it is of great interest to study relationships between the P = NP problems in various structures. This line of research was pioneered in <ref> [2] </ref> where it is shown that P = NP over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic 0 if and only if P = NP over C . Their result is based on an elimination of constants theorem. <p> Their result is based on an elimination of constants theorem. In this paper we take a different view: instead of eliminating constants only for inputs in a subfield K K of the original field as in <ref> [2] </ref>, we allow inputs from the original field. There is clearly a price to pay in order to achieve this result: one can no longer deal with arbitrary machines. For instance, it is impossible to recognize the language L = fg over C without transcendental constants. <p> In other words, if algebraic constants can be at all eliminated, they can be eliminated effectively, and efficiently. For transcendental constants, a similar result is established in section 7. This makes it possible to recover the transfer theorem of <ref> [2] </ref>. Since the general case is more involved, we start by eliminating transcendental constants from a restricted class of machines in section 4 (as shown in 2 section 5, the transfer theorem can be obtained from this partial result). <p> We have similar results in positive characteristic, but only for the non-uniform classes Pand NP. This gives a partial answer to an open problem in <ref> [2] </ref>. (for uniform classes, one can expect to have a transfer result at a higher level in the polynomial hierarchy, e.g., for the problem 2 = 2 .) Our results are based on quantifier elimination instead of algebraic number theory as in [2]. <p> a partial answer to an open problem in <ref> [2] </ref>. (for uniform classes, one can expect to have a transfer result at a higher level in the polynomial hierarchy, e.g., for the problem 2 = 2 .) Our results are based on quantifier elimination instead of algebraic number theory as in [2]. Along the way, we give in section 6 an application of quantifier-elimination to a more "concrete" problem, namely, the construction of correct test sequences in the sense of Heintz and Schnorr [8]. We construct short and correct test sequences for the class of polynomials which are "easy to compute". <p> We construct short and correct test sequences for the class of polynomials which are "easy to compute". This result can be viewed as a refinement of the Witness Theorem of <ref> [2] </ref>. Quantifier elimination techniques also apply to a restricted class of machines over real-closed fields. This will be elaborated in a future publication. 2 Background 2.1 Elimination of Quantifiers Good bounds for quantifier elimination can be found in a number of papers written in the last 15 years. <p> A sufficient condition for this to be true is: log 2N d (n log q)=2 and log n (n log q)=2. The second condition always holds for n 2, whence the result. 2 5 Transfer In characteristic 0, we recover the main result of <ref> [2] </ref>. Theorem 5 Let K K be two algebraically closed fields of characteristic 0. P = NP over K if and only if P = NP over K. Proof Sketch. If P = NP over K, HN K can be solved in polynomial time by a machine over K. <p> If P = NP over K, HN K is in P over K. By Theorem 4, we can assume that the corresponding circuit family is constant free. Therefore this circuit family also solves HN K by the transfer principle, and P= NP over K. 2 As pointed out in <ref> [2] </ref>, in characteristic 0 the problem P = NP over K reduces to the single problem P = NP over Q, the algebraic closure of Q. <p> The construction is surprisingly similar to that of Lemma 2: any sufficiently fast growing sequence of integers can do the job. Note that this result provides an alternative to the Witness Theorem of <ref> [2] </ref>. In that Theorem, it is shown that given the parameters of a straight line-program, one can dynamically construct a short test sequence which is correct for the corresponding polynomial. Here we show that, in fact, the same test sequence can be used for all values of the parameters.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction As in discrete complexity theory, the problem P ? = NP is a major open problem in the Blum-Shub-Smale model of computation over the reals <ref> [3] </ref>. It has been possible to show that P6=NP only in very simple structures, e.g., the reals with addition [11]. <p> We shall not go into a formal description of the model since there is a concise definition of the main complexity classes in terms of circuits [7, 15].

Reference-contexts: The following result is due to Heintz & Schnorr ([8], Theorem 4.4). It establishes the existence of small test sequences for family of polynomials computed by short straight-line programs (see <ref> [4] </ref> for an alternative proof of a similar result).

Reference-contexts: We note in passing that in contrast to other "non-standard" models of computation (e.g., oracle Turing machines), it is not known whether there exists a structure (even a "pathological" one) for which P = NP (the BSS model was generalized by Goode <ref> [7] </ref> and Poizat [15] to arbitrary first-order structures). Given this (rather sad) state of affairs, it is of great interest to study relationships between the P = NP problems in various structures. <p> It can use a finite number of constants from K in its program (eliminating these constants is the main goal of this paper). We shall not go into a formal description of the model since there is a concise definition of the main complexity classes in terms of circuits <ref> [7, 15] </ref>.

Such a vector can be constructed in polynomial time by Corollary 1 and Lemma 2 (we use repeated squaring). 2 The next lemma is similar to <ref> [8] </ref>, Lemma 4.2. 8 Lemma 2 Let P 2 Z [X 1 ; : : : ; X p ] be a degree d polynomial with coefficients bounded by M in absolute value. <p> In fact, v can be replaced by the number of so-called nonscalar operations, i.e., multiplications between two non-constant polynomials <ref> [8] </ref>.

The proof carries over to the present situation with minor modifications (Eduardo Sontag, personal communication). This lemma is also implicit in <ref> [8] </ref>. Theorem 8 There are universal constants c 1 and c 2 such that the following property holds: Set d = 2 (n+v) c 1 . <p> The claimed result then follows from Lemma 2. 2 It would be interesting to have a direct proof (bypassing Lemma 5) that sequences of points with exponentially fast-growing components are correct test sequences for W 0 (n; p; v). It is shown in <ref> [8] </ref> that W (d; n; v) can be embedded in a set of dimension (v + n)(v + n + 1). <p> This implies as in Lemma 5 that "most" test sequences of length (v + n)(v + n + 1) + 1 are correct for W (d; n; v) (this is implicit in the proof of Theorem 4.4 in <ref> [8] </ref>). In some cases this may be better than the p + 1 bound of Lemma 5 since v counts only non-scalar operations.
