Title: A Comparison of Measures for Detecting Natural Shapes in Cluttered Backgrounds

Abstract: We propose a new measure of perceptual saliency and quantitatively compare its ability to detect natural shapes in cluttered backgrounds to five previously proposed measures. As defined in the new measure, the saliency of an edge is the fraction of closed random walks which contain that edge. The transition probability matrix defining the random walk between edges is based on a distribution of natural shapes modeled by a stochastic motion. Each of the saliency measures in our comparison is a function of a set of affinity values assigned to pairs of edges. Although the authors of each measure define affinity somewhat differently, all incorporate the Gestalt principles of good-continuation and proximity in some form. In order to make the comparison meaningful, we use a single definition of affinity and focus instead on the performance of the different functions for combining affinity values. The primary performance criterion is accuracy. We compute false-positive rates in classifying edges as signal or noise for a large set of test figures (including a database of 240 fruit and vegetable silhouettes). In all cases, the new measure significantly outperforms previous measures.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The goal of segmentation is to partition a set of image measurements (e.g., edges) into equivalence classes corresponding to distinct objects. In this paper, we consider a somewhat simpler grouping problem which (following <ref> [11] </ref>) we call the saliency problem. The goal of the saliency problem is to assign a value to each edge which is correlated with whether that edge belongs to a shape or is background noise (see Figure 1). <p> They are also difficult to motivate using arguments based on the statistics of natural shapes. Functions in the second class are based on curves of least energy <ref> [4, 11] </ref>. The affinity between two directed edges is defined as the energy, R curve of least energy joining the two edges. Functions in the third class are based on an explicit prior probability distribution of natural shapes modeled by a stochastic motion [7, 12, 14]. <p> j ), that is, the affinity between two orientations is defined to be the maximum of the affinities among all combinations of directions. 2 Saliency Measures In the following section, we provide short synopses of the saliency measures used in the comparison. 2.1 Shashua and Ullman (SU) Shashua and Ullman <ref> [11] </ref> were the first to use the term saliency in the sense that it is being used in this paper.
