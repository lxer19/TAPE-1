Abstract: The Steiner tree problem requires to find a shortest tree connecting a given set of terminal points in a metric space. We suggest a better and fast heuristic for the Steiner problem in graphs and in rectilinear plane. This heuristic finds a Steiner tree at most 1.757 and 1.267 times longer than the optimal solution in graphs and rectilinear plane, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Zelikovsky [15, 17] and Berman/Ramaiyer <ref> [2] </ref> gave two better heuristics for NSP. Perfomance ratios of these heuristics are 11 6 1:84 and 16 9 1:78 and their runtimes are O (jSj (jEj+jV j log jV j)+ jV jjSj 2 ) and O (ff + jV j 2 jSj 3:5 ), respectively. <p> Here ff means time complexity of finding of all pairs shortest paths. In the recent paper Berman et al [3] gave a more precise (than in the first papers <ref> [16, 2] </ref> ) analysis of the performance ratio of these heuristics for RSP. They proved that their performance ratios are at most 1.3125 and 61 48 1:271, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Such a constant c must exist since NSP is SN P -complete <ref> [4] </ref>. We conjecture that c lies somewhere below 1.7 for that problem. Note that we do not know at the moment whether RSP is also SN P -complete, and therefore it could have a polynomial time approximation scheme.

Such subtrees are called full Steiner components of T <ref> [8] </ref>. A full Steiner tree with k terminals is named k-tree. The method described here can be applied with an arbitrary metric d.

Reference-contexts: However, finding such a tree is NP-hard for almost all interesting metrics, like Euclidean, rectilinear, Hamming distance, shortest-path distance in a graph etc. Because these problems have many applications, they were subject of extensive research <ref> [11] </ref>. In the last two decades many approximation algorithms for finding Steiner minimum trees appeared. The quality of an approximation algorithm is measured by its performance ratio: an upper bound of the ratio between the achieved length and the optimal length.

Reference-contexts: In the rectilinear metric, the distance between two points is the sum of the differences of their x and ycoordinates.
