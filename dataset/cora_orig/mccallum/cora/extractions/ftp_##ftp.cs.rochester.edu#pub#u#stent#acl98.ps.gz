Title: A Preliminary Model of Centering in Dialog  
Abstract: The centering framework explains local discourse coherence by relating a speaker's focus of attention and the forms of referring expressions. Although the model has proven useful in single-speaker discourse, its utility for multi-party discourse has not been shown. It is unclear how to adapt the model to handle discourse phenomena such as turn-taking, acknowledgments, first and second person pronouns, and disfluencies. This paper reports our experiments applying three naive formulations of centering theory for dialog. The models exhibit only mediocre predictive power for local focus. These results will be used as a baseline for future, more sophisticated models.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One of the most influential models in computational linguistics relating a speaker's local focus of attention to the form chosen for referring expressions is the centering framework (Grosz et al., 1983; Grosz et al., 1995). Although the model was originally intended to explain local coherence, subsequent research by <ref> (Brennan et al., 1987) </ref> showed that it could also be used to bind ambiguous pronouns. A number of subsequent studies have explored refinements and extensions of the theory (eg.

Reference-contexts: The canonical ordering on the Cf for English is Subject &gt; Direct Object &gt; Indirect Object &gt; Complements &gt; Adjuncts <ref> (Grosz et al., 1995) </ref>. 2 The model defines a preference ordering on techniques for effecting a topic change. Transition types are `shift', `retain' and `continue', based on whether Cb n = Cb n+1 and whether Cp n = Cp n+1 . <p> Central to the theory are the two centering rules: Rule 1: If any member of Cf n is realized by a 1 We provide only the briefest sketch of centering. Readers unfamiliar with the model are referred to <ref> (Grosz et al., 1995) </ref> 2 Subsequent work (Hahn and Strube, 1997) suggests that topicality should dominate over sentential role in determining the ordering of Cf , but we used the original model. 1 pronoun in Cf n+1 , Cb n+1 must also be a pronoun.

Reference-contexts: A model better reflects human notions of coherence if it has a high percentage of cheap transitions. 6 Future work This preliminary study indicates a variety of promising directions for future research. Some that we intend to pursue are: * Modify the Cf ordering as suggested by <ref> (Strube and Hahn, 1996) </ref>. * Modify utterance boundaries to re-attach interrupted utterances. * Improve the semantic theory of Cf to include associated and ellipsed entities.
