Reference-contexts: A clever generalization of this idea to multiple dimensions was recently found by Marius Mitrea [9]. The unbalanced Haar wavelets and the Mitrea wavelets have as disadvantage that they only have one vanishing moment and that they are non-smooth. Several other constructions of weighted wavelets already exist, see <ref> [1, 2, 8, 12] </ref>. However, they have the disadvantage that the wavelets are not compactly supported. In this paper we construct smooth, compactly supported, weighted wavelets with more vanishing moments.

It then follows that h L j;k ; fl The operator wavelets diagonalize the operator. A similar observation was made independently in <ref> [2] </ref>. The operator wavelets here are compactly supported, since the weighted wavelets have at least one vanishing weighted moment. The fast wavelet transform associated with the operator wavelets is easy to implement, because of their compact support.

Reference-contexts: Wavelets are often constructed with the use of the Fourier transform. The reason is that translation and dilation on the frequency side become algebraic operations. We call these wavelets algebraic wavelets. Examples of compactly supported algebraic wavelets are Daubechies' orthogonal wavelets and spline wavelets <ref> [3, 5] </ref>. Algebraic wavelets are (bi)orthogonal with respect to the L 2 inner product. In this paper we show how to construct wavelets adapted to a weighted inner product. We call such wavelets weighted wavelets. 2. Weighted multiresolution analysis.

Reference-contexts: Construction. Since the algebraic structure is gone, the Fourier transform cannot be used in the construction. Our construction is a generalization of the average-interpolation scheme of David Donoho <ref> [6] </ref>. This is a subdivision scheme for the construction of biorthog-onal algebraic wavelets without the use of the Fourier transform. From symmetry arguments one can understand that N has to be odd. We let N = 2D + 1. <p> This way we give meaning to the formal expression (6). In order to construct the scaling function ' i;k , we start from the Kronecker sequence f i;l g l = fffi kl g l . In the unweighted case, this scheme converges to an algebraic biorthogonal scaling function <ref> [6] </ref>. The idea to prove the convergence in the weighted case is to examine the behavior of the difference with the unweighted case. For a detailed treatment, we refer to [11].

Reference-contexts: The operator wavelets here are compactly supported, since the weighted wavelets have at least one vanishing weighted moment. The fast wavelet transform associated with the operator wavelets is easy to implement, because of their compact support. This results in a linear, non-iterative algorithm for the numerical solution of ODEs <ref> [7] </ref>. It outperforms finite element and finite difference methods. A similar idea is possible for constant coefficient operators such as the Helmholtz operator in one dimension. For these operator the wavelet method outperforms spectral methods. Acknowledgement.

Reference-contexts: It then follows immediately that the set f j;k g is orthogonal with respect to the weighted inner product. Since the wavelet is not symmetric, we call it the unbalanced Haar wavelet. A clever generalization of this idea to multiple dimensions was recently found by Marius Mitrea <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In the unweighted case, this scheme converges to an algebraic biorthogonal scaling function [6]. The idea to prove the convergence in the weighted case is to examine the behavior of the difference with the unweighted case. For a detailed treatment, we refer to <ref> [11] </ref>. We first show that the coefficients h j;k;l converge to the coefficients h l from the unweighted case if j tends to infinity. This way we know that on a sufficiently fine level the polynomial P in the construction always exists.
