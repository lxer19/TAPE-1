Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION This paper describes an automated document conversion system that explores the interactive domain of document image conversion. Our laboratory, with close corporate and government support since 1982, has had diverse experience in implementing complete automated document conversion systems in commercial environments (see <ref> [1] </ref>, [2], [3]). We have constructed systems for optical character recognition, handwritten character conversion, forms recognition, printed wiring phototool conversion, mechanical drawing conversion, electrical wiring drawing conversion, architectural drawing conversion, oil-well log conversion, diagram and graph drawing conversion.

An algorithm developed for this purpose is described in <ref> [2] </ref>. The subclasses of the class Feature are distinguished by the specific annotations, P m , available to the subclass. In the current implementation there are fourteen: IMAGE, TEXT, LINE, SYMBOL, FORM, TEXTURE, RULER, DISSECT, DIALOG, DETAIL, LEARNED, FORMAT, and LINK.
