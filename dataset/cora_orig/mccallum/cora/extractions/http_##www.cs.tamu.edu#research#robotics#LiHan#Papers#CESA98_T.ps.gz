Title: Object Reorientation with Finger Gaiting  
Author: Li Han and Jeffrey C. Trinkle 
Address: Texas A&M University  
Affiliation: Dept. of Computer Science  
Abstract: Coordinated object manipulation is a fundamental problem in the study of multi-fingered robotic hands. The conventional study has been focused on deriving control algorithms for finger joints to implement a specified object trajectory and recently more effort has been put into the study of automatic object trajectory planning. This paper discusses how to plan large-scale object reorientation with fingers of limited workspace. The relevant theories of contact kinematics, nonholonomic motion planning, grasp stability and finger gaiting are incorporated to develop a general framework of object reorientation with rolling contacts and finger gaiting. Our approach is illustrated by an example of reorienting a sphere with three hemi-spherical fingertips. The simulation results are presented.

Reference-contexts: The conventional study on object manipulation has been focused on control implementation of a known trajectory for the object. Many algorithms [10, 4, 5] have been proposed and reported achieving good simulation and experimental results. On the other hand, there is relatively few work <ref> [17, 3, 1] </ref> addressing the manipulation planning problem and the general problem remains open. One difficulty in the manipulation planning problem is the workspace limits of the robot fingers, arising from the mechanical and electrical limits of the fl Research supported in part by NSF grant no.

Due to the limited paper space, we don't give proofs here and interested readers please refer to our technique report <ref> [6] </ref>. Denote a sphere with radius r and center o as sphere (o; r). <p> Note the `longitude' and `equator' here are not restricted for one specific coordinate system of the sphere. Any two great circles that are perpendicular to each other can be made into a longitude and an equator, through some coordinate transformation <ref> [6] </ref>. If the initial grasp is only 3-finger FC but not 2-finger FC, the rolling path need be used to adjust the contact points to get a 2-finger FC grasp.

Our approach is applied to the problem of re-orienting a sphere with three hemi-spherical fingertips. The simulation results are presented. <p> Assuming the above necessary condition is satisfied, we identify two finger gaiting primitives: finger rewind and finger substitution. The three-finger gaiting proposed in paper <ref> [7] </ref> relocates the limiting fingers back to their workspace limits. The scenario is as the following: suppose fingers f 1 and f 2 form a grasp but reach their limits.

Reference-contexts: However, it requires detailed computation to maintain the 3 fingers to form a FC grasp before two fingers reach antepodal positions. Borrow the concept <ref> [11] </ref> of task-oriented optimal grasp, the initial grasps which are or close to 2-finger FC grasp are preferred for dextrous manipulation tasks with three fingers. 4 Simulation Results Figure (4) shows a simulation result of a sphere re-orientated by three spherical fingertips with finger substitution.

The contact model for three-finger grasp is hard-finger contact and the model for two-finger grasp is soft-finger contact <ref> [13] </ref>. To implement finger gaiting with three fingers, two fingers need to form a FC grasp. Then a necessary condition for using gaiting with three fingers is that at least one of the grasping fingers can form a force closure grasp with other two fingers of the hand.
