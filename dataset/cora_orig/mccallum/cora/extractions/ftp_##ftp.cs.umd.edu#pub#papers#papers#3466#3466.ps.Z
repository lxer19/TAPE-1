Reference-contexts: Representing grammatical knowledge as a set of simultaneous declarative constraints makes the parser's knowledge base more compact and more amenable to future extensions <ref> (Berwick, 1982) </ref>. Further computational considerations of the parsing process motivate the proposal of a hybrid architecture that integrates spreading activation into the symbolic network model. First, a local, discrete decision-making process among parallel alternatives can get "stuck" in an inconsistent solution without the benefit of a global overseer.

Reference-contexts: First of all, a network architecture allows for a direct mapping of the necessary linguistic knowledge into the computational framework. A recent advance in linguistic theory has been to adopt a so-called "principles and parameters" approach to capturing human linguistic knowledge <ref> (Chomsky, 1981, 1986a) </ref>. This type of approach is a reaction to serious drawbacks of rule-based systems, in which the construction-specific nature of rules can lead to extremely large grammars, with rules that do not generalize well to new constructions or to other languages.

Reference-contexts: Hirst, 1990), as well as parallel models that build multiple structures in response to an ambiguity (for example, Gibson, 1991; Gorrell, 1987), predict an increased processing load at the point of processing a verb with a subcategorization ambiguity. 9 Psycholinguistic experiments have found no evidence of such a processing load <ref> (see the discussion in Frazier, 1987) </ref>. For example, in an on-line judgment experiment by Gorrell (1987), reaction times to sentences with unambiguous NP complement verbs were the same as reaction times to sentences with ambiguous NP/sentential complement verbs that were used with an NP complement.

Reference-contexts: attachments; the numbers obtained in simulations using a CP complement were exactly the same as for an IP complement. 116 People strongly prefer to attach the NP directly to the verb phrase as the complement of the verb; this preference for the "simpler" alternative is commonly known as Minimal Attachment <ref> (Frazier, 1978) </ref>. Various sources of psycholinguistic evidence concerning the processing of these types of ambiguities appear to support contradictory sentence processing models.

Reference-contexts: The serial model hypothesis gains additional support from experimental evidence indicating that people require time to revise the preferred hypothesis when the sentence continues in the non-preferred way <ref> (Frazier & Rayner, 1982) </ref>. However, proponents of a parallel parsing model point to the fact that people have no conscious difficulty in parsing a non-preferred continuation|that is, a sentential complement. <p> Evidence for Reanalysis In addition to the syntactic priming data, proponents of a parallel model point to the fact that the non-preferred resolution of this type of ambiguity is easy for people to process. However, detailed eye-movement studies <ref> (Frazier & Rayner, 1982) </ref> have shown that people exhibit longer per-letter reading times in the disambiguating region when these types of sentences are resolved in the non-preferred way. 13 The competitive attachment model provides a unifying account of these disparate observations. <p> For example, increasing the length of the post-verbal NP in a sentence like example (7.8) leads to longer per-letter reading times in the disambiguating region than in the version of the sentence with a short post-verbal NP <ref> (Frazier & Rayner, 1982) </ref>. The straightforward interpretation is that longer reading times correspond to more difficult reanalysis. Other models of human parsing have not provided a principled explanation of 27 Frazier & Rayner (1982) provide experimental evidence for increased reading times at the disambiguating point in these types of sentences.

Reference-contexts: However, because of their fundamental assumptions, they are unable to account for the purely syntactic influences on initial parsing preferences that have been identified <ref> (for example, see the discussion in Gibson, 1991) </ref>. Furthermore, the context-based proposals fail to explain how semantic and pragmatic information alone can guide the reanalysis of erroneous syntactic structure.

Reference-contexts: Tuning these extra parsing mechanisms to different languages can be problematic. In addition to basic structural differences between languages, it appears that some parsing preferences may remain constant across languages, while others vary <ref> (Gibson et al., 1993) </ref>. It is an open question whether the observed differences are due to frequency effects in the languages, or result from some more fundamental structural properties.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, syntactic priming experiments contribute evidence that the human parser has access to the non-preferred structural alternative prior to having seen explicit evidence for that alternative in the input <ref> (Gorrell, 1987) </ref>. The priming data have been interpreted as support for the parallel construction and maintenance of the alternative complement possibilities.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, massively parallel models that incorporate symbolic capabilities show promise in their ability to model human linguistic performance. This success 7 However, recent work on Optimality Theory <ref> (Prince & Smolensky, 1993) </ref> has potential to relate high-level symbolic representations of linguistic knowledge to well-established connectionist processing techniques. 14 encourages the exploration of hybrid connectionist techniques that can support syntactic am-biguity resolution, while at the same time reaping the benefits of distributed parsing within a network of simple, uniform processing

Reference-contexts: The second basic assumption of the model is that competition in the parsing network is effected solely through the use of competition-based spreading activation (CBSA) <ref> (Reggia, 1987) </ref>; the use of inhibitory links is not allowed. The sole use of CBSA in a network configuration of this complexity has not previously been attempted, and requires that there be additional limitations placed on the structure of the parsing network. <p> Thus, the more active destination nodes receive a higher proportion of n i 's output. Although within this approach two competing nodes do not directly suppress each other's activation, apportioning the output to them based on their current level of activation can also achieve a winner-take-all behavior <ref> (Reggia, 1987) </ref>. In this case, it is the gradual decrease of positive input, rather than the increase of negative input, that eventually "turns off" all but one of a set of competing nodes. In summary, there are two potential methods for achieving competitive dynamics within a connectionist network. <p> possible attachments; 7 thus, in an approach based on pairwise inhibition between competing attachment nodes, there are O (n 4 ) potential inhibitory links. 8 Second, the use of CBSA is actually more flexible in its ability to easily allow for a multiple-winners-take-all relationship among a set of competing nodes <ref> (Reggia, 1987) </ref>. This ability is crucial to the correct behavior of the stack data structure in the parser, which is discussed in Section 4.1.3. A third important computational benefit follows from the restrictiveness of these assumptions.

Reference-contexts: this communication method, the parsing network is able to enforce even long-distance grammatical constraints entirely through local, distributed interactions among the syntactic nodes. 144 8.1.2 Competitive Network Dynamics One of the potential advantages of competition-based spreading activation (CBSA) is its suitability for use within computational models of higher-level cognitive abilities <ref> (Reggia, Marsland, & Berndt, 1988) </ref>.
