Abstract: Although Minimum Distance Parsing (MDP) offers a theoretically attractive solution to the problem of extragrammat-icality, it is often computationally infeasible in large scale practical applications. In this paper we present an alternative approach where the labor is distributed between a more restrictive partial parser and a repair module. Though two stage approaches have grown in popularity in recent years because of their efficiency, they have done so at the cost of requiring hand coded repair heuristics (Ehrlich and Han-rieder, 1996; Danieli and Gerbino, 1995). In contrast, our two stage approach does not require any hand coded knowledge sources dedicated to repair, thus making it possible to achieve a similar run time advantage over MDP without losing the quality of domain independence.

Reference-contexts: Lehman's core grammar, described in (Lehman, 1989), has on the order of 300 rules, and all of the inputs to her system can be assumed to be commands to a calendar program. Hipp's Circuit Fix-It Shop system, described in <ref> (Hipp, 1992) </ref>, has a vocabulary of only 125 words and a grammar size of only 500 rules. Flexible parsing algorithms introduce a great deal of extra ambiguity. This in turn may deem certain approaches impractical for systems of realistic scale. <p> Substitutions and transpositions are not allowed in this version of the parser, nor is it possible to set a separate maximum penalty for skipping and for inserting. Additionally, insertions and deletions are weighted equally, where some researchers have weighted them differently <ref> (Hipp, 1992) </ref>. These and other possibilities are left for future inquiry. 7 Evaluation The LR MDP parser was run over the corpus at three different flexibility settings. The first setting, MDP 1, is Minimum Distance Parsing with maximum deviation penalty of 1.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we compare the performance of the two stage ROSE approach with MDP. A parameterized version of Lavie's GLR* parser <ref> (Lavie, 1995) </ref> is used which has been extended to perform a limited version of MDP in which insertions and deletions are possible, but not transpositions or substitutions. We refer to this parameterized MDP parser as LR MDP. <p> This in turn may deem certain approaches impractical for systems of realistic scale. Therefore, an important question one must ask is whether the MDP approach can scale up to a larger system and/or domain. An example of a more restrictive parsing algorithm is Lavie's GLR* skipping parser described in <ref> (Lavie, 1995) </ref>. GLR* is a parsing system based on Tomita's Generalized LR parsing algorithm which was designed to be robust to two particular types of extra-grammaticality: noise in the input, and limited grammar coverage. <p> As mentioned above, we make use of a version of Lavie's GLR* parser <ref> (Lavie, 1995) </ref> extended to be able to perform both skipping and inserting which we refer to as LR MDP. This makes it possible to compare the two stage ROSE approach to MDP keeping all other factors constant.

Reference-contexts: Thus, Minimum Distance Parsing appears to be a reasonable approach. In practice, however, Minimum Distance Parsing has only been used successfully in very small and limited domains. Lehman's core grammar, described in <ref> (Lehman, 1989) </ref>, has on the order of 300 rules, and all of the inputs to her system can be assumed to be commands to a calendar program.
