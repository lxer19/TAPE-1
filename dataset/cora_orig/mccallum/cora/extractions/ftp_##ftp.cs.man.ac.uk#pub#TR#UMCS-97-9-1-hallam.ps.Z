Abstract: In many fields, efforts at standardisation and the definition of benchmark problems have resulted in greater coherence and focus. Researchers are able to compare their own work with that of others in a standard test scenario, and work is in principle easily replicated and exchanged. In this position paper, we explore the possibilities, and their consequences, of introducing such benchmarking in the field of robotics research.
