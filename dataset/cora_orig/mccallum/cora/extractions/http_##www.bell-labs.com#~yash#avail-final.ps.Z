Abstract: In this paper we study the failure probabilities of quorum systems and in particular of non-dominated coteries (NDC). We characterize NDC's in terms of the failure probability, and prove that any NDC has availability that falls between that of a singleton and a majority consensus. We show conditions for weighted voting schemes to provide asymptotically high availability, and analyze the availability of several other known quorum systems.

Reference-contexts: This extremal question has been addressed before 9 in a slightly more general setting, i.e., lower bounds on the number of hyperedges of a non 2--colorable hypergraph (NDC's are 3-colorable hypergraphs [GB85]). Two results are presented in <ref> [AS92] </ref>, a simple bound due to Erd-os [Erd63] which gives m 2 c1 , and a more delicate asymptotic bound due to Beck [Bec78] of m (2 c c 1=3 ).

Reference-contexts: In this work the term coterie and the concept of domination are introduced. Several basic properties of dominated and non-dominated coteries and of the class of non-dominated coteries (denoted NDC) are proved. 1 The fault-tolerance properties of quorum-based mutual exclusion protocols are introduced in <ref> [BG86] </ref> and studied further in [Coh93]. The fault tolerance of a quorum system is measured by the maximal number of processors that can fail before all the quorums are "hit", in the worst possible configuration of failures. A quorum is "hit" once at least one of its members has failed. <p> As will be shown in the sequel, it turns out that the property of non-domination has a strong effect on the failure probability F p (S). It is known that the NDC's are "the most available" quorum systems (e.g., <ref> [BG86, INK92] </ref>). Over the NDC's, the behavior of the failure probability F p depends on the exact value of p. We show that for any S 2 NDC, F p (S) is symmetric, i.e., F p (S) = 1 F 1p (S). <p> Therefore, as shown in [KC91], F p (d) P (at least one failure per row) = (1 q d ) d ! d!1 6 The Availability of Weighted Voting A simple and popular method to define and implement quorum systems is by weighted voting <ref> [Gif79, GB85, BG86, AAC91, MP92a] </ref>. In a voting system, each element is assigned a number of votes, and a quorum is any subset of elements with a weight exceeding half of the total weight.

Reference-contexts: A quorum is "hit" once at least one of its members has failed. The failure probability F p , or equivalent notions such as reliability or availability, are well known in reliability theory [BP75]. In <ref> [BG87] </ref> the availability of coteries is studied. It is shown that in a complete network the optimal availability quorum system is the majority (Maj) coterie if p &lt; 1 2 . <p> We show that for 0 &lt; p &lt; 1 2 , the least available NDC (highest F p (S)) is the "monarchy" (the singleton system Sngl). By the same proof we get almost for free a new proof for the result of <ref> [BG87] </ref>, that the most available NDC is the "democracy" (the majority system Maj). By the above mentioned symmetry of F p , when 1 2 &lt; p &lt; 1 the situation is reversed. <p> The following theorem establishes the extremal-availability quorum systems to be the singleton (Sngl) and majority (Maj). The left hand side inequality of claim 1 of the theorem is due to <ref> [BG87] </ref>. The left hand side inequality of claim 2 has been proved independently in [DKK + 94]. The proof below proves all four inequalities at once. Theorem 4.5 Let S 2 NDC be given.

Moreover, as shown in [RST92, KC91], the finite projective plane construction [Mae85] and grid construction <ref> [CAA90] </ref> have failure probabilities tending to 1 for all values 0 &lt; p &lt; 1. A simple and popular method of NDC construction is that of weighted voting. When all the votes are equal, this gives the simple majority system. <p> We get Y (1 q jSj ) = (1 q t+1 ) t 2 +t+1 ! 1: Note that this holds for any p &gt; 0. Therefore, the FPP coterie has poor availability in all but very small systems. 5.7 The Grid Coterie The Grid coterie appears in <ref> [CAA90, MP92a] </ref>. The n = d 2 elements are arranged in a d fi d grid, and a quorum in the system consists of one complete row and a representative element from all the other rows.

Reference-contexts: Set systems with the intersection property are known as quorum systems, and the sets in such a system are called quorums. Quorum systems have been used in the study of distributed control and management problems such as mutual exclusion (cf. [Ray86]), data replication protocols (cf. <ref> [DGS85, Her84] </ref>), name servers (cf. [MV88]), selective dissemination of information (cf. [YG94]), and distributed access control and signatures (cf. [NW95]). A protocol template based on quorum systems works as follows.

Reference-contexts: We have very 2 recently learned that the optimality of the monarchy when p &gt; 1 2 has been obtained independently by Diks et al. <ref> [DKK + 94] </ref>. We also show that if we require all the elements to appear in some quorum, then the Wheel system of [MP92a] replaces the singleton as the extremal system. <p> The following theorem establishes the extremal-availability quorum systems to be the singleton (Sngl) and majority (Maj). The left hand side inequality of claim 1 of the theorem is due to [BG87]. The left hand side inequality of claim 2 has been proved independently in <ref> [DKK + 94] </ref>. The proof below proves all four inequalities at once. Theorem 4.5 Let S 2 NDC be given.

Reference-contexts: The simple majority system is the most obvious voting system. Alternative protocols based on quorum systems (rather than on voting) appear in [Mae85] (using finite projective planes), [AE91] (the Tree system), [CAA90, KRS93] (using a grid), [Kum91, KC91, RT91, RST92] (hierarchical systems).

Moreover, as shown in [RST92, KC91], the finite projective plane construction [Mae85] and grid construction [CAA90] have failure probabilities tending to 1 for all values 0 &lt; p &lt; 1. <p> at least one other element fail, or the hub does not fail and all others do, therefore we have F p (Wheel) = p (1 q n1 ) + qp n1 = p pq (q n2 p n2 ): 5.2 The Triang Coterie The Triang system was first described in <ref> [Lov73, EL75] </ref> and proved to be ND in [Nei92, MP92a]. The elements are organized in a triangular grid of d rows, with the i'th row containing i elements (we assume n = d (d+1) 2 ). <p> Therefore, using the symmetry Theorem 3.3, we conclude that F p (Tree) is Condorcet. 20 5.4 The Nuc Coterie The nucleus (Nuc) system appears first in <ref> [EL75] </ref>, and a variation appears in [Tuz85]. The system is built in two stages. First consider a nucleus universe U 1 of size 2r 2 for some r &gt; 1, and add to S all the subsets of U 1 of size r. <p> After both steps, the universe size is n = 2r 2 + 1 2 2r2 . Therefore c (Nuc) 1 2 log 2 n. The number of quorums is m (Nuc) = 2r 2 ! r 1 = 2 2r ! The Nuc system has some interesting extremal properties <ref> [EL75] </ref>. In particular, it serves as an extreme case for a coterie for which it is hard to balance the load among the processors [HMP95].

Reference-contexts: In particular, F 1=2 (S) = 1 2 for any S 2 NDC. The converse is also true, i.e., if F 1=2 (S) = 1 2 then S 2 NDC. As a consequence, we also obtain a new proof for the lower bound of <ref> [Erd63] </ref> on the number of quorums in an NDC. We then consider the quorum system constructions that have the extremal failure probabilities. We show that for 0 &lt; p &lt; 1 2 , the least available NDC (highest F p (S)) is the "monarchy" (the singleton system Sngl). <p> This extremal question has been addressed before 9 in a slightly more general setting, i.e., lower bounds on the number of hyperedges of a non 2--colorable hypergraph (NDC's are 3-colorable hypergraphs [GB85]). Two results are presented in [AS92], a simple bound due to Erd-os <ref> [Erd63] </ref> which gives m 2 c1 , and a more delicate asymptotic bound due to Beck [Bec78] of m (2 c c 1=3 ). We show, by a new proof, a bound that is better than the simple one yet is inferior to Beck's result.

Reference-contexts: Clearly E S is a monotone increasing property (i.e., if a configuration X hits S then any configuration X 0 X hits S).

Reference-contexts: Then the finite projective plane of order t is a quorum system with m (FPP) = t 2 + t + 1 quorums, each of size c (FPP) = t + 1.

The asymptotic behavior of the FPP's availability has been shown in [RST92], and we include it for completeness.

In this section we consider voting systems over a universe of size n for increasing n. <p> To amend this situation, we discard all the quorums that are supersets of other quorums. 22 Definition 6.2 Let the Voting Coterie defined by the weights w i be Vote = fS 2 Vote F : 8u 2 S; S n fug 62 Vote F g: In <ref> [GB85] </ref> it is shown that if the total weight W is odd then Vote 2 NDC. If W is even then either Vote is dominated, or there exists a different distribution of weights w 0 with an odd total that defines the same (non dominated) Vote coterie.

Reference-contexts: Set systems with the intersection property are known as quorum systems, and the sets in such a system are called quorums. Quorum systems have been used in the study of distributed control and management problems such as mutual exclusion (cf.

Reference-contexts: As will be shown in the sequel, it turns out that the property of non-domination has a strong effect on the failure probability F p (S). It is known that the NDC's are "the most available" quorum systems (e.g., <ref> [BG86, INK92] </ref>). Over the NDC's, the behavior of the failure probability F p depends on the exact value of p. We show that for any S 2 NDC, F p (S) is symmetric, i.e., F p (S) = 1 F 1p (S). <p> The second consequence we obtain from the symmetry theorem is a lower bound on m (S), the number of quorums in a system S 2 NDC, in terms of c (S), the cardinality of the smallest quorum. The following lemma of <ref> [INK92] </ref> shows that NDC's are "better" (i.e., have higher availability) than dominated coteries. Lemma 3.5 [INK92] Let S; R be coteries such that R S, and let 0 &lt; p &lt; 1. Then F p (R) F p (S). <p> The following lemma of <ref> [INK92] </ref> shows that NDC's are "better" (i.e., have higher availability) than dominated coteries. Lemma 3.5 [INK92] Let S; R be coteries such that R S, and let 0 &lt; p &lt; 1. Then F p (R) F p (S). We improve this result slightly by showing that NDC's are strictly better. This is necessary for the proof of Corollary 3.9.

Reference-contexts: The triangular system is due to [Lov73, EL75]. The Wheel system appears in [MP92a]. The class of "Crumbling Wall" coteries appears in <ref> [PW95] </ref>. The first paper to explicitly consider mutual exclusion protocols in the context of intersecting set systems is [GB85]. In this work the term coterie and the concept of domination are introduced.

Reference-contexts: Then X i ~ B (p). Let the total weight of the failed elements be Z = P n system fails exactly when Z W 2 . We want to bound the probability of this event using the Chernoff-type bound for weighted sums, due to Raghavan and Spencer <ref> [Rag88] </ref>. For this bound to be applicable, the weights need to be at most 1. Therefore we scale the weights by a factor of w max , defining ^w i = w max Clearly 0 &lt; ^w i 1.

Reference-contexts: Set systems with the intersection property are known as quorum systems, and the sets in such a system are called quorums. Quorum systems have been used in the study of distributed control and management problems such as mutual exclusion (cf. <ref> [Ray86] </ref>), data replication protocols (cf. [DGS85, Her84]), name servers (cf. [MV88]), selective dissemination of information (cf. [YG94]), and distributed access control and signatures (cf. [NW95]). A protocol template based on quorum systems works as follows.

Reference-contexts: The simple majority system is the most obvious voting system. Alternative protocols based on quorum systems (rather than on voting) appear in [Mae85] (using finite projective planes), [AE91] (the Tree system), [CAA90, KRS93] (using a grid), <ref> [Kum91, KC91, RT91, RST92] </ref> (hierarchical systems). The triangular system is due to [Lov73, EL75]. The Wheel system appears in [MP92a]. The class of "Crumbling Wall" coteries appears in [PW95]. The first paper to explicitly consider mutual exclusion protocols in the context of intersecting set systems is [GB85]. <p> We show that several other constructions also have Condorcet failure probabilities (e.g., the constructions of [EL75, AE91]), while others still (e.g., [Lov73]) have a nonzero limit function when p &lt; 1 2 . Moreover, as shown in <ref> [RST92, KC91] </ref>, the finite projective plane construction [Mae85] and grid construction [CAA90] have failure probabilities tending to 1 for all values 0 &lt; p &lt; 1. A simple and popular method of NDC construction is that of weighted voting. <p> It has been shown in [Fu90] that for all t 3, the FPP of order t is dominated. The only 21 non-dominated FPP is of order 2, i.e., the 7 point Fano plane. The asymptotic behavior of the FPP's availability has been shown in <ref> [RST92] </ref>, and we include it for completeness. Let F p (t) denote F p (FPP) for a finite projective plane of order t. To bound F p (t) from below, we apply the same argument as in the proof of Proposition 3.10 and use the FKG inequality.

Reference-contexts: It is shown that in a complete network the optimal availability quorum system is the majority (Maj) coterie if p &lt; 1 2 . The case when the elements fail with different probabilities p i , all less than 1 2 , is addressed in <ref> [SB94] </ref>. The availability of k-coteries is studied in [KFYA93]. A characterization of non-dominated coteries in terms of boolean functions appears in [IK93, BI93]. The issue of balancing the work load in quorum systems is studied in [MP92b, HMP95].

Reference-contexts: any other user trying to enter the critical section before the first user has exited (and released the permission-granting quorum from its lock) will be refused permission by at least one member of any quorum it chooses to access. 1.2 Related Work The first distributed control protocols using quorum systems <ref> [Tho79, Gif79] </ref> use voting to define the quorums. Each processor has a number of votes, and a quorum is any set of processors with a combined number of votes exceeding half of the system's total number of votes. The simple majority system is the most obvious voting system.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, using the symmetry Theorem 3.3, we conclude that F p (Tree) is Condorcet. 20 5.4 The Nuc Coterie The nucleus (Nuc) system appears first in [EL75], and a variation appears in <ref> [Tuz85] </ref>. The system is built in two stages. First consider a nucleus universe U 1 of size 2r 2 for some r &gt; 1, and add to S all the subsets of U 1 of size r.

In order to perform some action (e.g., update the database, enter a critical section), the user selects a quorum and accesses all its elements.
