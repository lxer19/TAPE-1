Abstract: In this paper we study the notion of group knowledge in a modal epistemic context. Starting with the standard definition of this kind of knowledge on Kripke models, we show that this definition gives rise to some quite counter-intuitive behaviour. Firstly, using a strong notion of derivability, we show that group knowledge in a state can always, but trivially be derived from each of the agents' individual knowledge. In that sense, group knowledge is not really implicit, but rather explicit knowledge of the group. Thus, a weaker notion of derivability seems to be more adequate. However, adopting this more `local view', we argue that group knowledge need not be distributed over (the members of) the group: we give an example in which (the traditional concept of) group knowledge is stronger than what can be derived from the individual agents' knowledge. We then propose two additional properties on Kripke models: we show that together they are sufficient to guarantee `distributivity', while, when leaving one out, one may construct models that do not fulfil this principle.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the field of AI and computer science, the modal system S5 is a well-accepted and by now familiar logic to model the logic of knowledge (cf. <ref> [3, 14] </ref>). Since the discovery of S5's suitability for epistemic logic, many extensions and adaptions of this logic have been proposed. In this paper we look into one of these extensions, namely a system for knowledge of m agents containing a modality for `group knowledge' . <p> paper, we try to make the underlying notions that together constitute G explicit: What does it mean for a group of, say m agents, to combine their knowledge? We start by giving and explaining a clear semantical definition of group knowledge, as it was given by Halpern and Moses in <ref> [3] </ref>. In order to make some of our points, we distinguish between a global and a local notion of (deductive and semantic) consequence. Then we argue that the defined notion of group knowledge may show some counter-intuitive behavior. <p> Actually, instead of being able to communicate with each other , one may also adopt the idea that the G-knowledge is just the knowledge of one distinct agent, to whom all the agents communicate their knowledge (this agent was called the `wise man' in <ref> [3] </ref>; a system to model such communication was proposed in [11]). We will refer to this reading of G (i.e., in a `send and receiving context') as `a receiving-agent's knowledge'. We start by defining the language that we use.

Reference-contexts: Since in systems for knowledge and belief, the phrase `implicit' already had obtained its own connotation (cf. [10]), later on, the term `distributed knowledge' (with the operator D) became the preferred name for the group knowledge we want to consider here (cf. <ref> [4] </ref>). Since we do not want to commit ourselves to any fixed terminology we use the operator G to model the `group knowledge'.

Reference-contexts: For multi-agent architectures in which agents have the possibility to communicate (like for instance [11]) the principle (4) is rather relevant. This so called principle of full communication captures the intuition of fact discovery (cf. <ref> [5] </ref>) through communication.

Reference-contexts: Intuitively this `group knowledge' (let us write G for it) is not the knowledge of each of the agents in the group, but the knowledge that would result if the agents could somehow `combine' fl This is an improved and extended version of <ref> [6] </ref> 1 their knowledge. The intuition behind this notion is best illustrated by an example. Let the formula ' denote the proposition that P 6= N P . Assume that three computer scientists are working on a proof of this proposition.

Reference-contexts: In other words, this equality is not modally definable, although one can find a complete axiomatization for those models that satisfy it. For more on this, the reader is referred to <ref> [7] </ref>. In that paper, the authors also show that definability of R 1 " : : : " R m = R G is achieved when using graded modal logic.

Reference-contexts: But in this logic, the assumption of distinguishability of a model seems to be unnatural; graded modal logic is typically designed to be able to reason about numbers (and hence copies) of worlds. Also, in <ref> [8] </ref> the same authors demonstrate that proving an epistemic logic involving both group knowledge and common knowledge complete with respect to S5 m (G)-like models can be quite complicated. Again, distinguishability 18 of the models have to be given up.

Reference-contexts: Initially this knowledge in a group was referred to as `implicit knowledge' and indicated with a modal operator I. Since in systems for knowledge and belief, the phrase `implicit' already had obtained its own connotation (cf. <ref> [10] </ref>), later on, the term `distributed knowledge' (with the operator D) became the preferred name for the group knowledge we want to consider here (cf. [4]). Since we do not want to commit ourselves to any fixed terminology we use the operator G to model the `group knowledge'.

In the multiple-agent case, this distinguishing requirement needs to be lifted from the propositional level to the whole language L.
