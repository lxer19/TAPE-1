Title: The RSA Algorithm and PGP  
Author: Godmar Back 
Note: PGP.  
Date: February 23, 1996  
Abstract: This write-up gives a complete in-depth derivation of the RSA algorithm, based on a proof for Euler's Theorem. The implementation of the algorithm in the PGP software written by Phil Zimmermann will be discussed, as well as the two other important algorithms used in PGP, IDEA and MD5. The last section provides a crash course in using

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Public-key cryptography has recently become the focus of public attention as governments in and outside the U.S. try to regulate information flow on the Internet. What is public-key cryptography about? The following concise explanation from Phil Zimmermann can be found in <ref> [1] </ref> Pretty Good (tm) Privacy (PGP), from Phil's Pretty Good Software, is a high security cryptographic software application for MSDOS, Unix, VAX/VMS, and other computers. PGP allows people to exchange files or messages with privacy, authentication, and convenience. <p> The reader is referred to the documentation provided with PGP for more information <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We are now ready to state Euler's Theorem. Theorem 1 (Euler's Theorem) If m is a positive integer and a is an integer with (a; m) = 1, then a (m) 1 (mod m). The idea behind the prove is best illustrated with the following example taken from <ref> [2] </ref>. Example: We know that both 1; 3; 5; 7 and 3 1; 3 3; 3 5; 3 7 are reduced residue systems modulo 8. Therefore, (3 1) (3 3) (3 5) (3 7) 1 3 5 7 modulo 8. We know that (1 3 5 7; 8) = 1. <p> We need to mention another property of Euler's function before we're ready to state the encryption function of the RSA algorithm. Theorem 2 Euler's function is multiplicative, i.e., if m and n are relatively prime positive integers, then (mn) = (m)(n). The proof can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. 2.2 Ciphering Procedure We will first describe the ciphering procedure, and then prove that it has the desired properties. Let p and q be two large prime numbers. Let n = pq and m = (n).

Reference-contexts: Each iteration uses 6 16-bit subkeys and the final transformation uses 4 16-bit subkeys. All 52 subkeys are generated from the 128 session key. The scheme is demonstrated in figure 1 taken from <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.2 MD5 The purpose of the MD5 algorithm is to compute a hashfunction over the whole text. Similar to a checksum, this function ensures the integrity of the message. Unlike a checksum, however, it is very hard to find a changed message that has the same message digest. <p> MD5 was developed by Ron Rivest and is defined in [5]. Source code is available in C, a Java port is available as well. MD5 involves the following steps, shown in figure 2 from <ref> [3] </ref>. * Append Padding Bits The message is padded such that its length becomes 64 less than the next multiple of 512.
