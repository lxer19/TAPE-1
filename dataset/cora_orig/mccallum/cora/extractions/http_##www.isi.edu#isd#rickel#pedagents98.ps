Reference-contexts: Virtual Environments for Training In collaboration with Lockheed Martin and the USC Behavioral Technologies Laboratory, we have developed a toolkit called Virtual Environments for Training (VET) <ref> (Johnson et al. 1998) </ref>. The VET system allows multiple students and agents to cohabit a virtual world. Students get a 3D, immersive view of the world through a head-mounted display. They interact with the world using data gloves.
