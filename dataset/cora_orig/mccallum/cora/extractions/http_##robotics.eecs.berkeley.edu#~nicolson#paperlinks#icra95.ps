Abstract: This papers analyzes the reliability of radius of curvature estimates from tactile sensor data. A linear elastic model is used to fit the indenter parameters, load, location, and curvature, to the sensor output. It was found that both contact models and calibration techniques could dramatically effect the bias and variance of the estimated indenter parameters. The Fourier series is found to be an appropriate basis in which to analyze both the calibration of tactile sensors and the problem of bandlimited shape interpretation.

Reference-contexts: Robotic tactile sensors have also been shown to have the capability of providing curvature information [5], however results using finite-element models of tactile sensors indicate that reliable shape classification is hard <ref> [3] </ref>. It is well known that the rubber layer on the finger acts as a spatial low pass filter and that the frequency of the filter cutoff decreases as sensor depth increases [4, 11, 16], so we expect that shape sensing capabilities will depend on sensor depth.

For this reason the design of <ref> [4] </ref>, Figure 7, was adopted with a few changes. Sensor spacing around the circumference was halved to reduce the aliasing that was predicted by the frequency response. Dow Corning silicone rubber was used instead of isoprene rubber as silicone rubber demonstrated reduced hysteresis in preliminary experiments.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently it has been shown that the human tactile sensory system is capable of fine shape discrimination from static touch [6]. Robotic tactile sensors have also been shown to have the capability of providing curvature information <ref> [5] </ref>, however results using finite-element models of tactile sensors indicate that reliable shape classification is hard [3]. <p> The main problem with using machine vision techniques is that they are not well adapted to the low resolution typically afforded by tactile sensors. Another approach is to develop tactile sensor data analysis techniques based on the mechanics of the rubber material in which they are usually embedded. In <ref> [5] </ref> it is shown how the linear elastic half space model can be used to determine contact location, curvature, orientation, and force from low resolution subsurface normal strain data on a cylindrical finger. It is the goal of this paper to extend [5] by addressing the reliability of curvature estimates. <p> In <ref> [5] </ref> it is shown how the linear elastic half space model can be used to determine contact location, curvature, orientation, and force from low resolution subsurface normal strain data on a cylindrical finger.

Reference-contexts: Recent theoretical results indicate that discrimination can be accomplished if the indenter class is known, however indenter classification requires shallower sensors and hence a greater sensor density than can currently be constructed in a cylindrical geometry <ref> [10] </ref>. Most robotic tactile sensors have not yet demonstrated as fine a shape discrimination ability as has been demonstrated in humans [6] despite having similar sensor densities. <p> The more poorly conditioned directions have their energy concentrated in the very low and high frequencies <ref> [10] </ref>. 4 Shape from strain In Figure 5 the relationship between the various maps and contact models is shown with the forward directions going from left to right. It is clear that if we use a Hertz model there is an easy forward path from contact parameters to sensor values.

This paper partially explains this phenomena by comparison of model based and empirical calibration techniques. We start by briefly reviewing the linear elastic model introduced in <ref> [11] </ref> and then use it to calibrate a tactile sensor and predict indenter parameters. 2 Linear elastic tactile sensor model Under the assumptions of material linearity, isotropy, and homogeneity the problem of determining indenter shape, location, and total load from subsurface strain measurements on a tactile sensor may be analyzed with <p> (r b ; ) = p () = p 0 + k=1 k cos k + k=1 k sin k The solution to this linear elastic problem for the boundary conditions of zero stress outside the contact region at r b and zero displacement at r a is given in <ref> [11] </ref>. The line-load normal-strain frequency response determines which spatial frequencies will be sensed by the tactile sensor for a given set of radii: r a , r s , and r b . responses in a conventional Bode plot. <p> This map is denoted by S. Analysis of the first map allows us to formulate sensor spacing requirements and sensing capabilities for a given depth of sensor as was done in <ref> [11] </ref>. The second map, from indenter shape to surface pressure, provides a convenient way to determine a pressure distribution for an arbitrary indenter shape. In Figure 5 the relationship between the various maps and contact models is shown with the forward directions going from left to right. <p> To determine p from the indenter parameters radius, r c , location, c , and contact width, w , one of two techniques can be used. The first is the Hertz model, described in Appendix A. The second is based on singular value decomposition and is described in <ref> [11] </ref>. In each contact model is shown. <p> Use of a Hertz model resulted in an average error of 4.2 % strain while use of the frictionless contact model described in <ref> [11] </ref> resulted in an average error of 2.2 % strain.
