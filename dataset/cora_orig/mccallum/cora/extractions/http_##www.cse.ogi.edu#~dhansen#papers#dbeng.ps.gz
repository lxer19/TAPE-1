Abstract: Scientific applications and databases rarely interoperate easily. That is, scientific researchers who use computers expend significant time and effort writing special procedures to use their program with someone else's data, or their data with someone else's programs. These problems are exacerbated in modern computing environments, which consist of multiple computers of possibly different types. Database researchers at the Scientific Database Laboratory at the Oregon Graduate Institute (OGI) are using object-oriented databases to address problems of program and data interoperability. For the domain of computational chemistry, we are extending an existing object database system to facilitate the invocation, monitoring, and output capture of a variety of independently developed programs (aka legacy applications). A complementary project in materials science explores providing application programs with a common interface to a variety of separately published datasets. We are also developing an object-oriented toolbox to access the contents of a database of protein structures. We describe these three projects, then discuss their status and our future directions.

Reference-contexts: When the user schedules a run, a proxy uses a description of the application to automatically transform experimental attributes held in the database into textual inputs appropriate for a given application. If necessary, the input files are transferred to the computer on which that application is to run <ref> [CMR93] </ref>. Figure 1 illustrates the computational proxy encapsulation of syntactic detail of different programs and computer types. cations. Computational proxies aid in interfacing standalone, heterogeneous applications to a common database, simplifying the computing environment for domain scientists and masking syntactic differences among scientific applications.

Reference-contexts: Because of the complex structure of protein molecules, attempts to use relational DBMS's have not been totally successful. Jointly with Columbia University and Brookhaven National Laboratories, we are developing an object-oriented toolbox for PDB that will use modern software engineering principles and object-oriented DBMS technology <ref> [PSO + 92] </ref>. The toolbox consists of software instruments to access the contents of PDB and will have the reliability, performance, usability, and extensibility of modern computer software. Now under development, the 3 first demonstration program, PDBTool, will be used to verify molecular structures.
