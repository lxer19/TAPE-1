Abstract: We discuss the determination of workspaces of discretely actuated manipulators using convolution of real-valued functions on the Special Euclidean Group. Each workspace is described in terms of a density function that provides for any unit taskspace volume of the workspace the number of reachable frames therein. A manipulator consisting of n discrete actuators each with K states can reach K n frames in space. Given this exponential growth, brute force representation of discrete manipulator workspaces is not feasible in the highly actuated case. However, if the manipulator is of macroscopically-serial architecture, the workspace can be generated by the following procedure: (1) partition the manipulator into segments; (2) approximate the workspace of each segment as a continuous density function on a compact subset of the Special Euclidean Group; (3) approximate the whole workspace as an n-fold convolution of these densities. We represent density functions as finite Hermite-Fourier Series and show for the planar case how the n-fold convolution can be performed in closed form requiring O(n) computation time. If all segments are identical the computation time reduces to O(logn).
