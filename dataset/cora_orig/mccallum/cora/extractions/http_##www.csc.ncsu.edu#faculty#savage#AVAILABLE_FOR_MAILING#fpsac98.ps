Abstract: It follows from work of Andrews and Bressoud that for t 1, the number of partitions of n with all successive ranks at least t is equal to the number of partitions of n with no part of size 2 t. However, no simple combinatorial explanation of this fact has appeared in the literature. We give a simple bijection for this identity which generalizes a result of Cheema and Gordon for 2-rowed plane partitions. The bijection yields several refinements of the identity when the partition counts are parametrized by the minimum successive rank, the number of parts and/or the size of the Durfee rectangle. In addition, it gives a natural interpretation of the difference of (shifted) successive Gaussian polynomials which we relate to other interpretations of Andrews and Fishel. D'apres un travail d'Andrews et Bressoud, il suit que pour t 1, le nombre de partitions de n dont le rang minimal vaut au moins t est egal au nombre de partitions sans parts de taille 2t. Pourtant aucune explication combinatoire simple de ce fait n'est apparue dans la litterature. Nous donnons une bijection simple pour cette identite qui generalise un resultat de Cheema et Gordon pour les partitions planes ayant au plus deux lignes. Cette bijection entraine plusieurs raffinements de l'identite quand les partitions sont comptees selon le rang
