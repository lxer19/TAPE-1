Abstract: Compression with Reversible Embedded Wavelets (CREW) is a unified lossless and lossy continuous-tone still image compression system. Reversible wavelets are non-linear filters which implement exact-reconstruction systems with minimal precision integer arithmetic. Wavelet coefficients are encoded in a bit-significance embedded order, allowing lossy compression by truncating the compressed data. Lossless coding of wavelet coefficients is unique to CREW. In fact, most of the coded data is created by the lessor significant bits of the coefficients. CREWs context-based coding, called Horizon coding, takes advantage of the spatial and spectral information available in the wavelet domain and adapts well to the lessor significant bits. In applications where the size of an image is large, it is desirable to perform compression in one pass using far less workspace memory than the size of the image. A buffering scheme which allows a one-pass implementation with reasonable memory is described. CREW is a completely new type of image compression system. CREW is the first lossless and lossy continuous-tone still image compression system. It is based on a lossless (reversible) wavelet transform and has embedded quantization where quantization decisions can be made after encoding. It is pyramidal (hierarchical without difference images) and progressive by nature. RICOH Corporation and its parent, RICOH Company, Ltd., are entering this technology in the competition for the JTC1.29.12 work item of the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 (formerly the JPEG and JBIG committees). This work item calls for a lossless and near-lossless still continuous-tone image compression system. RICOH intends to promote CREW as a standard [1]. Unlike other lossless compression systems, CREWs lossy performance naturally extends from the near-lossless into the high compression range. CREW is one of the first lossless system to use the proven energy compaction efficiency of transform coding. Transform coding has been the state-of-the-art for lossy coders since the mid 1970s. CREW brings transform technology to lossless image compression. Unlike JPEG or any other lossy compressor, CREW has continuous rate-distortion performance all the way to zero distortion (lossless). (It should be noted that this feature was considered desirable but not achieved by the original JPEG standard effort.) CREW has rate-distortion performance comparable to JPEG for modest compression rates and much better performance at high compression rates.

Reference-contexts: This work item calls for a lossless and near-lossless still continuous-tone image compression system. RICOH intends to promote CREW as a standard <ref> [1] </ref>. CREW has a number of features that should be expected of the compression standards of the next century including: unified lossy/lossless compression, embedded quantization, pyramidal and progressive transmission, simple implementation in software and hardware, excellent lossless and lossy performance. <p> This method is visually competitive with bi-cubic spline but is far less computationally intensive with the CREW transform. This virtue will be described in the proposal to the ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 committee <ref> [1] </ref>. 1.1.5 Idempotent CREW is idempotent, meaning that an image can be decompressed in a lossy form and recompressed to the same lossy codestream. This virtue allows multiple compression and decompression cycles in an application that has browsing, filtering, or editing.

Reference-contexts: This exibility enables exactly the portability that will be required in the future applications and standards. 1.1.2 Embedded quantization Lossy compression is achieved by embedded quantization. Embedded is used here to indicate that the codestream includes the quantization. This is more general than the definition used in <ref> [2] </ref>. In other words, the compressed data is created in order of visual importance (or tagged by visual importance). The actual quantization (or visual importance) levels can be a function of the decoder or the transmission channel, not necessarily the encoder.

In fact, reversible wavelets are a special digital implementation of exact reconstruction wavelets. A reversible transform is an implementation of an exact reconstruction transform in integer arithmetic, such that a signal with integer coefficients can be losslessly recovered. <p> This is useful for in pyramidal systems, defined in the next section, where the smooth output is decomposed further. TS-transform has excellent energy compaction and is one of the best wavelet transforms for lossy compression [7] <ref> [8] </ref>. There is no systemic error due to rounding in the integer implementation of the transform, so all error in a lossy system can be controlled by quantization. 2.1.1 Tree structure of wavelet decomposition quadrants.

Reference-contexts: The particular ordering for this implementation is described in Section 3.2.1. The embedded order used within a coefficient is bit-significance in the transform domain which is similar to but more general than the system used in <ref> [15] </ref>. The largest possible coefficient is used as a reference, and the coefficients are aligned with respect to it. This alignment is near-optimal in terms of statistical error metric such as MSE. Other alignments could correspond to coefficient specific quantization.

Reference-contexts: Currently, experiments are underway with three difference coders. A finite state machine coder [3][4] that is simple to implement, a parallel coder [5][6] that is very fast in hardware, and the Q-coder <ref> [16] </ref> that is well known. All have similar compression performance. <p> In these cases, the adaptation feature of the entropy coder is not necessary and, in fact, can be a source of compression inefficiency. For the following contexts a fixed (non-adaptive) state, described in terms of the states of the Q-coder <ref> [16] </ref> is used. Context 10000000000 is coded at the fixed Q-coder state 0 - probability approximately 0.5. This context is for coding the sign bit when the sign of the N-coefficient is not known. Context 10100000000 is coded at the fixed Q-coder state 4 - probability approximately 0.7.
