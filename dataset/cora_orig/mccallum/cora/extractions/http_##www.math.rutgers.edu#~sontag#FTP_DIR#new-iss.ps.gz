Reference-contexts: For each j 1, we let j (t) = x (t; p 0 ; d j ), t 0. Consider first f j (t)g j1 as a sequence of functions defined on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. From Fact III.1 we know that there exists some compact subset S 1 of R n such that x (t; p 0 ; d j ) 2 S 1 for all 0 t 1, for all j 1. <p> Let M = supfjf (~; )j : ~ 2 S 1 ; 2 Og. Then fi dt j (t) fi M for all j and almost all 0 t 1. Thus the sequence f j (t)g j1 is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, so by the Arzela-Ascoli Theorem, we may pick a subsequence f 1 (j)g j1 of fjg j1 with the property that f 1 (j) (t)g j1 converges to a continuous function 1 (t), uniformly on [0; 1]. <p> Thus the sequence f j (t)g j1 is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, so by the Arzela-Ascoli Theorem, we may pick a subsequence f 1 (j)g j1 of fjg j1 with the property that f 1 (j) (t)g j1 converges to a continuous function 1 (t), uniformly on [0; 1]. Now we consider f 1 (j) (t)g j1 as a sequence of functions defined on [1; 2]. <p> Now we consider f 1 (j) (t)g j1 as a sequence of functions defined on <ref> [1; 2] </ref>. Using the same argument as above, one proves that there exists a subsequence f 2 (j)g j1 of f 1 (j)g j1 such that f 2 (j) (t)g j1 converges uniformly to a function 2 (t) for t 2 [1; 2]. <p> (t)g j1 as a sequence of functions defined on <ref> [1; 2] </ref>. Using the same argument as above, one proves that there exists a subsequence f 2 (j)g j1 of f 1 (j)g j1 such that f 2 (j) (t)g j1 converges uniformly to a function 2 (t) for t 2 [1; 2]. Since f 2 (j)g is a subsequence of f 1 (j)g, it follows that 2 (1) = 1 (1). <p> Finally, let p k = (k) for each k 1. Observe that both p 0 and p 1 are in S 1 by construction. Next, for each j 1, we wish to study the trajectory x (t; p 1 ; d 1 (j) ) for t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. This may be a priori undefined for all such t. <p> In particular, ex (t; 1 (j) (1); d 1 (j) ) = x (t; 1 (j) (1); d 1 (j) ), for each j, since these both equal x (1 t; p 0 ; d 1 (j) ), for each t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The set of states reached from S 1 , using the modified system, in negative times t 2 [1; 0], is included in some compact set (because the modified system is complete, and again appealing to Fact III.1). <p> The set of states reached from S 1 , using the modified system, in negative times t 2 <ref> [1; 0] </ref>, is included in some compact set (because the modified system is complete, and again appealing to Fact III.1). <p> Thus, by Gronwall's estimate, there is some L 0 so that, for all j 1 and all t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, fi ex (t; p 1 ; d 1 (j) ) x (t; 1 (j) (1); d 1 (j) ) fi fi fi (no "~" needed in the second solution, since it is also a solution of the original system). <p> Since 1 (j) (1) ! p 1 , it follows that there exists some j 1 such that for all j j 1 , fi fi r 0 (22) for all t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Note that this means in particular that ex (t; p 1 ; d 1 (j) ) 2 B (S 1 ; r=4) e S 1 for all such t, for all j j 1 , so "~"can be dropped in Equation (22) for all j j 1 . <p> Now let 0 &lt; r 1 &lt; r 0 be such that fi fi r 0 (23) for all t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, for all p 2 B (p 1 ; r 1 ). As this implies in particular that ex (t; p; d 1 (j 1 ) ) 2 B (S 1 ; r=2) e S 1 , again tildes can be dropped. <p> Combining (22) and (23), it follows that for each p 2 B (p 1 ; r 1 ), x (t; p; d 1 (j 1 ) ) is defined for all t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and fi fi (24) for all t 2 [0; 1]. Let w 1 (t) = d 1 (j 1 ) (t). <p> Combining (22) and (23), it follows that for each p 2 B (p 1 ; r 1 ), x (t; p; d 1 (j 1 ) ) is defined for all t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and fi fi (24) for all t 2 [0; 1]. Let w 1 (t) = d 1 (j 1 ) (t). <p> for each p 2 B (p 1 ; r 1 ) it holds that x (1; p 1 ; w 1 ) 2 B (p 0 ; r 0 ), and, since x (t; 1 (j 1 ) ; d 1 (j 1 ) ) 62 for all t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, In what follows we will prove, by induction, that for each i 1, there exist 0 &lt; r i &lt; r i1 and w i of the form SONTAG AND WANG: NEW CHARACTERIZATIONS OF INPUT TO STATE STABILITY 7 w i = i1 d i (j) for some j, <p> i of the form SONTAG AND WANG: NEW CHARACTERIZATIONS OF INPUT TO STATE STABILITY 7 w i = i1 d i (j) for some j, so that, for all p 2 B (p i ; r i ), x (t; p; w i ) is defined for all t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, x (t; p; w i ) 62 B (K; r=2) 8 t 2 [0; 1]; x (1; p; w i ) 2 B (p i1 ; r i1 ) : The case i = 1 has already been shown in the above argument. <p> w i = i1 d i (j) for some j, so that, for all p 2 B (p i ; r i ), x (t; p; w i ) is defined for all t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, x (t; p; w i ) 62 B (K; r=2) 8 t 2 [0; 1]; x (1; p; w i ) 2 B (p i1 ; r i1 ) : The case i = 1 has already been shown in the above argument. Assume now that the above conclusion is true for i = 1; 2; : : : ; k. <p> a compact set ~ S k+1 containing a neighborhood of R k+1 O (p 0 ), one can show that there exists some j k+1 k+1 so that, for all j j k+1 , x (t; p k+1 ; k+1 d k+1 (j) ) is defined for all t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and jx (t; p k+1 ; k+1 d k+1 (j) ) for all 0 t 1. <p> is a subsequence of f k (j)g j1 , it follows that there exists some ~ j k+1 0 such that fi fi r k (26) maxf j k+1 ; ~ j k+1 g, and let w k+1 (t) = k d k+1 (j k+1 ) (t) for t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Then, (25), applied with j = j k+1 , says that: jx (t; p k+1 ; w k+1 ) for all t 2 [0; 1]. <p> (26) maxf j k+1 ; ~ j k+1 g, and let w k+1 (t) = k d k+1 (j k+1 ) (t) for t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Then, (25), applied with j = j k+1 , says that: jx (t; p k+1 ; w k+1 ) for all t 2 [0; 1]. <p> w k+1 ) 2 B (p k ; r k =2) : (28) Pick any r k+1 so that 0 &lt; r k+1 &lt; r k and for every p 2 B (p k+1 ; r k+1 ), x (t; p; w k+1 ) is defined for all t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and for all t 2 [0; 1]. Then for such a choice of r k+1 , it holds, for each p 2 B (p k+1 ; r k+1 ), by equation (27), that fi fi &lt; 4 for all t 2 [0; 1], which implies that, for each p <p> ; r k =2) : (28) Pick any r k+1 so that 0 &lt; r k+1 &lt; r k and for every p 2 B (p k+1 ; r k+1 ), x (t; p; w k+1 ) is defined for all t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and for all t 2 [0; 1]. Then for such a choice of r k+1 , it holds, for each p 2 B (p k+1 ; r k+1 ), by equation (27), that fi fi &lt; 4 for all t 2 [0; 1], which implies that, for each p 2 B (p k+1 ; r k+1 <p> ) is defined for all t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and for all t 2 [0; 1]. Then for such a choice of r k+1 , it holds, for each p 2 B (p k+1 ; r k+1 ), by equation (27), that fi fi &lt; 4 for all t 2 [0; 1], which implies that, for each p 2 B (p k+1 ; r k+1 ), Moreover, it follows from (28) and (29) that x (1; p; w k+1 ) 2 B (p k ; r k ) for all p 2 B (p k+1 ; r k+1 ). <p> Since this is disjoint from A, there is a smooth function ' : R n ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> so that '(~) = 0 ; if ~ 2 A; Similarly, there is some smooth, nonnegative function defined on R n which vanishes exactly on e A.

For each subset O of the input-value space U, each T 0, and each subset C R n , we denote R T and = T 0 O (C) : In <ref> [9, Proposition 5.1] </ref>, it is shown that: Fact III.1: Let (1) be a forward-complete system. <p> There are at least two ways to prove this fact. The first is very short but uses a converse Lyapunov theorem; the second is self-contained but longer. Each proof is of interest, so we provide both.
