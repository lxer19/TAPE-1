Abstract: A new multichannel MAC protocol called Hop Reservation Multiple Access (HRMA) for packet-radio networks is introduced, specified and analyzed. HRMA is based on very-slow frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) and takes advantage of the time slotting necessary for frequency hopping. HRMA allows a pair of communicating nodes to reserve a frequency hop (channel) using a hop reservation and handshake mechanism on every hop to guarantee collision-free data transmission in the presence of hidden terminals. HRMA provides a baseline to offer QoS in ad-hoc networks based on simple half-duplex slow FHSS radios. We analyze the throughput achieved in HRMA for the case of a fully-connected network assuming variable-length packets, and compare it against an ideal multichannel access protocol and the multichannel slotted ALOHA protocol. The numerical results show that HRMA can achieve much higher throughput than multichannel slotted ALOHA in the traffic-load ranges of interest, especially when the average packet length is large compared to a slot size, in which case the maximum throughput of HRMA is close to what can be obtained with an ideal protocol.

However, it would be difficult for asynchronous groups to merge in 802.11 networks, because there is no equivalent to our proposed synchronization slot and frequency hop. 2.2.

Reference-contexts: Accordingly, developing medium access control (MAC) protocols with which the nodes (packet-radios) of ad-hoc networks can share the ISM bands efficiently is critical for the future success of such networks. In ISM bands, radios must operate using direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) or frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) <ref> [2] </ref>. This paper focuses on the design of an efficient MAC protocol for ad-hoc networks based on FHSS radios operating in ISM bands. The maximum dwell time allowed in ISM bands is 400 msec [2], which at 1Mbps allows entire packets to be transmitted within the same frequency hop. <p> In ISM bands, radios must operate using direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) or frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) <ref> [2] </ref>.

The maximum dwell time allowed in ISM bands is 400 msec [2], which at 1Mbps allows entire packets to be transmitted within the same frequency hop. On the other hand, keeping the sender and receiver synchronized on the same frequency hops while a packet is being transmitted is not simple when nodes move and data rates are high (1Mbps). <p> A data packet transmitted in HRMA can be of any length and the node can send multiple data packets as well. However, because HRMA operates in the ISM band, a data packet or packet train cannot exceed the maximum dwell time allowed by the FCC <ref> [2] </ref>. The source and destination dwell on the same frequency hop during the entire data packet or packet train.

Reference-contexts: IEEE 802.11 [1] incorporates a convergence layer that makes the characteristics of the physical layer transparent to the MAC protocol. A concrete example of using very-slow frequency-hopping radios is the MAC protocol used in Metri-com's Ricochet wireless data network <ref> [3] </ref>, which assumes that each receiver has its own frequency hopping sequence and makes the sender learn the hopping sequence of the receiver. The sender synchronizes with the receiver's hopping sequence and transmits all its data packet over the same frequency hop on which the receiver is tuned. <p> The sender synchronizes with the receiver's hopping sequence and transmits all its data packet over the same frequency hop on which the receiver is tuned.

We consider here a slotted ALOHA with ROCA. To keep tractable, we further assume that transmitting has the highest priority and preempts any receiving. When a packet arrives at a node not transmitting, it will be transmitted at the beginning of the next slot.

Reference-contexts: The pseudo code in Figure 1 presents the specification of HRMA. We note that the mechanism used to contend for and re serve frequency hops in HRMA is similar in complexity to such simple MAC protocols as FAMA [4][7] and MACAW <ref> [5] </ref>. To simplify our analysis, a non-persistent policy is used for hop reser vations; persistent versions of HRMA are also possible. 2.1. Synchronizing Nodes to a Common Hopping Sequence As in any MAC protocol operating with FHSS radios, time in HRMA is slotted.
