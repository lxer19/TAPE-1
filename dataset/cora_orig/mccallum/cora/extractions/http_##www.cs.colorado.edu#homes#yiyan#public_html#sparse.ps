Abstract: Two sparse preconditioned iterative methods are presented to solve dense linear systems arising in the solution of two dimensional boundary integral equations. In the first method, the sparse preconditioner is constructed simply by choosing a small block of elements in the coefficient matrix of a dense linear system. The two-grid method falls into this category when the dense linear system arises from the Nystrom method for a second kind boundary integral equation. In the second method, the sparse preconditioner is obtained through condensation of the coefficient matrix by discrete Fourier transforms, which can be implemented efficiently using fast Fourier transforms. Both iterative methods involve only O(N 2 ) arithmetic operations per iteration, and converge rapidly when the dense linear systems arise from quadrature methods for boundary integral equations arising in two dimensional problems. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the computational efficiency of each method.

Reference-contexts: Among the iterative methods are two-grid methods (see Brakhage <ref> [1] </ref>, Atkinson [2], [3], Hackbusch [9], [10], Atkinson & Graham [5], Atkinson [6]) and multigrid methods (see Hackbush [9], [10], Hemker & Schippers [12], Schippers [21], and Mandel [14]).

Its convergence in this special case follows from an analysis for a two-grid method given in <ref> [2] </ref>. The block-preconditioned iterative method cannot be applied directly to the linear system (1.2) when C is not the identity matrix. Instead, a Fourier-condensation-preconditioned Richardson iteration (FCPRI) method is introduced. Since (1.1) can be viewed as a special case of (1.2), the FCPRI method also applies to (1.1).

The algorithm of this algebraic form is more transparent for computing since neither approximate integral operators nor a matrix from a low level are involved. We emphasize that Algorithm 1 is valid based on the assumption that (1.1) arises in second kind boundary integral equations on smooth boundaries. <p> We emphasize that Algorithm 1 is valid based on the assumption that (1.1) arises in second kind boundary integral equations on smooth boundaries. When a boundary with corners is considered, it is shown in <ref> [5] </ref> that some special treatment near corners is necessary for satisfactory performance of the two grid method. It may be possible to modify the preconditioner in Algorithm 1 and preserve its sparsity structure to cope with the special modification around corners.
