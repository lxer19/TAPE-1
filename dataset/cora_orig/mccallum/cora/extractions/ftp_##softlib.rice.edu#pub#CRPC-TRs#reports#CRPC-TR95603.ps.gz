Title: SOME BOUNDS ON THE NUMBER OF DETERMINING NODES FOR WEAK SOLUTIONS OF THE NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS  
Author: MICHAEL HOLST 
Keyword: Key Words. Approximation theory, Sobolev spaces, regularity, weak solutions, Navier-Stokes equations, determining nodes, Grashof number, Gronwall lemma.  
Abstract: New upper bounds on the dimension of the determining set are derived for weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations. These results extend the recent bounds due to Jones and Titi in three ways: the bounds are derived under the minimal H 1 -regularity required to define a weak solution, they are valid for arbitrary polyhedral domains, and the bounds hold in both two and three dimensions. The generalizations are made possible through the use of some new results in polynomial approximation theory of non-smooth functions in Sobolev spaces.

Reference-contexts: In x3, some specific imbeddings are considered in more detail. Many of the imbedding results require that the domain be bounded with a locally Lipshitz boundary, denoted as 2 C 0;1 (cf. page 67 in <ref> [2] </ref>). As an example, bounded open convex sets R d satisfy 2 C 0;1 (Corollary 1.2.2.3 in [7]).

One approach to generalizing Definition 1 to the H 1 0 () case is to generalize the interpolant I h so that it remains well-defined; we employ the SZ-interpolant I h of the previous section for this purpose. <p> The following generalized version of the Gronwall inequality will be a key tool in the analysis to follow.
