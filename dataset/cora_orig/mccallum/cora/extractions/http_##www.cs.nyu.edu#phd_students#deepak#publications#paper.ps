Author: Arun Verma, Deepak Goyal and P C P Bhatt 
Address: New Delhi 110016  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science and Engineering Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi  
Abstract: The objective of this paper is offer a methodology to arrive at a co-operative computing platform. In particular we recommend suitable use of order preserving protocols and use of frame-work tools. We demonstrate the utility of such a platform by showing the use of this platform in such varied applications such as conferencing, distributed data-bases, incremental computing and and scientific computing.

Reference-contexts: As the communication model should allow processes within a group to have a consistent view of the inter-group and intra-group status and yet offer seemingly synchronous activity we chose the "Virtually Synchronous" model of execution offered by ISIS <ref> [1] </ref> and depicted in fig. 1. ISIS has certain nice properties that ensure ordering of messages and group broadcast protocols. See figure 1.
