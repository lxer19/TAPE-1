Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) <ref> [1] </ref> is a promising technique to utilize the enormous bandwidth of the optical fiber. Multiple wavelength-division multiplexed channels can be operated in a single fiber simultaneously; however, a fundamental requirement in fiber-optic communication is that these channels operate at different wavelengths so as not to interfere with one another.

Reference-contexts: In a WDM network, it is possible to route data to their respective destinations based on their wavelengths. The use of wavelength to route data is referred to as wavelength routing, and a network which employs this technique is known as a wavelength-routed network <ref> [2] </ref>. Such a network consists of wavelength-routing switches (or routing nodes) which are interconnected by optical fibers. Some routing nodes (referred to as cross-connects) are attached to access stations where data from several end-users could be multiplexed on to a single WDM channel.

In order to transfer data from one access station to another, a connection needs to be set up at the optical layer similar to the case in a circuit-switched telephone network.

Reference-contexts: An ideal wavelength converter should possess the following characteristics <ref> [5] </ref>: * transparency to bit rates and signal formats. * fast setup time of output wavelength. * conversion to both shorter and longer wavelengths. * moderate input power levels. * possibility for same input and output wavelengths (no conversion). * insensitivity to input signal polarization. * low-chirp output signal with high <p> This method has been demonstrated for bit rates up to 10 Gbps [9]. However, this method is much more complex and consumes a lot more power than the other methods described below <ref> [5] </ref>. Moreover, the process of opto-electronic (O/E) conversion adversely affects transparency. All information in the form of phase, frequency, and analog amplitude of the optical signal is lost during the conversion process. <p> These techniques belong to a class known as optical-gating wavelength conversion [9]. * Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers (SOAs) in XGM and XPM mode: The principle behind using an SOA in the cross gain modulation (XGM) mode is shown in Fig. 7 (from <ref> [5] </ref>). The intensity-modulated input signal modulates the gain in the SOA due to gain saturation. A continuous wave (CW) signal at the desired output wavelength ( c ) is modulated by the gain variation so that it carries the same information as the original input signal. <p> The input signal and the CW signal can be launched either co-or counterdirectional into the SOA. The XGM scheme gives a wavelength-converted signal that is inverted compared to the input signal. While the XGM scheme is simple to realize and offers penalty-free conversion at 10 Gbps <ref> [5] </ref>, it suffers from inversion of the converted bit stream and extinction ratio degradation for an input signal "up-converted" to a signal of equal or longer wavelength. <p> An incoming signal that depletes the carrier density will modulate the refractive index and thereby result in phase modulation of a CW signal (wavelength c ) coupled into the converter <ref> [5, 16] </ref>. The SOA can be integrated into an interferometer so that an intensity-modulated signal format results at the output of the converter. Techniques involving SOAs in XPM mode have been proposed using the nonlinear optical loop mirror (NOLM) [17], Mach-Zender interferometer (MZI) [18] and Michelson interferometer (MI) [19]. <p> Techniques involving SOAs in XPM mode have been proposed using the nonlinear optical loop mirror (NOLM) [17], Mach-Zender interferometer (MZI) [18] and Michelson interferometer (MI) [19].

Reference-contexts: A possible architecture of such a wavelength-convertible switching node is the dedicated wavelength convertible switch (see Fig. 9, from <ref> [24] </ref>). In this architecture, each wavelength along each output 9 link in a switch has a dedicated wavelength converter, i.e., an M fi M switch in an N -wavelength system requires M fi N converters. <p> However, the dedicated wavelength-convertible switch is not very cost efficient since all of the wavelength converters may not be required all the time [25]. An effective method to cut costs is to share the converters. Two architectures have been proposed for switches sharing converters <ref> [24] </ref>. <p> When opto-electronic wavelength conversion is used, the functionality of the wavelength converter can be performed at the access stations instead of at the switches. The share-with-local switch architecture proposed in <ref> [24] </ref> (see Fig. 11) and the simplified network access station architecture proposed in [26] (see Fig. 12) fall under this category. 3 Network Design, Control and Management Issues 3.1 Network Design Network designs must evolve to incorporate wavelength conversion effectively. <p> Designs of switch architectures have been proposed (see Section 2.2) which allow sharing of converters among the various signals at a switch. It has been shown in <ref> [24] </ref> that the performance of such a network saturates when the number of converters at a switch increases beyond a certain threshold. An interesting problem is to quantify the dependence of this threshold on the routing algorithm used and the blocking probability desired. 3. <p> However, if all switches in the network are enabled with full wavelength conversion (see Fig. 9), the network becomes equivalent to a circuit-switched telephone network [36]. Routing algorithms have been proposed for use in a wavelength-convertible network <ref> [37, 24] </ref>. In [24], the routing algorithm approximates the cost function of routing as the sum of individual costs due to using channels and wavelength converters. For this purpose, an auxiliary graph is created and the shortest-path algorithm is applied on the graph to determine the route. <p> However, if all switches in the network are enabled with full wavelength conversion (see Fig. 9), the network becomes equivalent to a circuit-switched telephone network [36].

For this purpose, an auxiliary graph is created and the shortest-path algorithm is applied on the graph to determine the route. <p> deliver almost all of the performance improvement offered by an ideal full-range converter. 4.2.4 "Minimal" wavelength conversion in WDM rings [46] In addition to reducing the overall blocking probability, wavelength converters can improve the fairness performance by allowing many long-distance lightpaths, which would have been blocked otherwise, to be established <ref> [24] </ref>. In this paper, the authors define the Unfairness Factor as the ratio of the average blocking on the longest path to the blocking on the shortest path. The Fairness Ratio is then defined as the ratio of the Unfairness Factor without wavelength conversion to that with wavelength conversion.

Reference-contexts: Finally, various wavelengths are multiplexed to form an aggregate signal coupled to an outbound fiber link. However, the dedicated wavelength-convertible switch is not very cost efficient since all of the wavelength converters may not be required all the time <ref> [25] </ref>. An effective method to cut costs is to share the converters. Two architectures have been proposed for switches sharing converters [24].

The analytical model follows from <ref> [43] </ref> but employs both link-load independence and wavelength-independence assumptions. The routing algorithm used is a fixed one. The wavelength-assignment algorithm attempts to minimize the number of converters used and breaks ties by choosing the input wavelength with the lowest index at the converters.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, converters with just half of the full conversion range deliver almost all of the performance improvement offered by an ideal full-range converter. 4.2.4 "Minimal" wavelength conversion in WDM rings <ref> [46] </ref> In addition to reducing the overall blocking probability, wavelength converters can improve the fairness performance by allowing many long-distance lightpaths, which would have been blocked otherwise, to be established [24]. <p> Moreover, for large interconnected rings, this improvement can be achieved with wavelength conversion in just 10-20% of the nodes. Two analytical models for calculating the blocking probabilities in rings without wavelength conversion that use the Max Reuse algorithm for wavelength assignment are described in <ref> [46] </ref>. For simplicity, the authors limit their models to the worst-case scenario in which all lightpaths are longest-path connections. 26 4.2.5 Limited wavelength conversion in WDM networks [30] Limited-range wavelength conversion together with sparse location of converters in the network (see section 3.1) is the focus of this study [30].
