Reference-contexts: Thus, convergence to a solution depends on the choice of initial iterate x 0 . In order to reduce or eliminate this dependency on x 0 , globalization methods of either the trust region or linesearch damping type are used (Fletcher 1987). Linesearch damping <ref> (Armijo 1966, Goldstein 1967) </ref> was originally proposed in the context of the unconstrained minimization of a function f : IR n 7!

Reference-contexts: Many of the applications mentioned above are taken from economics and related fields. In these disciplines, the GAMS modeling language <ref> (Brooke, Kendrick & Meeraus 1988) </ref> is widely accepted and extensively used to formulate linear, nonlinear, and mixed integer programs. It was only natural, then, that complementarity problems be formulated in GAMS as well. <p> Notable examples include the GAMS modeling language <ref> (Brooke et al. 1988) </ref>, first introduced in the late 1970's, and AMPL (Fourer et al. 1993), a more recent entry into the field; many other systems exist. <p> These pairs are then used by the appropriate MCP library to construct an MCP, as described in Chapter 2. The model fragments given in Figures 9 and 10 exclude parameter and set definitions, etc. Those unfamiliar with how these are defined should consult the GAMS <ref> (Brooke et al. 1988) </ref> or AMPL (Fourer et al. 1993) user's manuals. In a GAMS/MCP model, the component functions are defined using the GAMS constraint syntax, while the complementarity pattern is defined in the model statement by a list of constraint-variable pairs.

Reference-contexts: A ray start is performed, in which 0 is set to minf j 0; e + q 0g. This ray start leads directly to an initial basic feasible solution (BFS) <ref> (Chvatal 1983) </ref> of the system (4.8). Note that the variables z and w are feasible for the LCP (i.e., z 0, w 0, w = M z + q) only if = 0.

Reference-contexts: While it is possible to express the discrete time problem without using the x variables, this results in a dense problem. For this reason, the state variables x and y are retained in the MCP formulation. 3.2.7 An Obstacle Problem The obstacle problem <ref> (Ciarlet 1978) </ref> consists of finding the equilibrium position of an elastic membrane subject to a vertical force f pushing upwards. In our example, we consider a membrane with height v on a domain D := (0; 1) fi (0; 1).

Reference-contexts: Nondefault settings for these are best specified in an options file whose form and content depend on the algorithm developer. Examples of options file formats are the SPEC file of MINOS 5.0 (Murtagh & Saunders 1983) and the 32 keyword-value syntax of MINOS 5.4, Lancelot <ref> (Conn, Gould & Toint 1992) </ref>, and PATH (Dirkse & Ferris 1994). The GAMS user can specify whether an options file is to be used by setting the optfile option. This logical value is passed to the solver via a call to cpgetl, using the "optfil" string.

Reference-contexts: In the smooth case, the Newton direction yields a zero of the approximation and also serves as a descent direction for the merit function <ref> (Dennis & Schnabel 1983) </ref>. The paths we construct have similar properties. Recall from Section 4.2, (4.7b) that the norm of the approximation A k goes to zero linearly in (1 t) on the path p.

Reference-contexts: This development has continued with the extension of the GAMS language to allow the formulation of mixed complementarity problems <ref> (Dirkse et al. 1994) </ref>. <p> Examples of options file formats are the SPEC file of MINOS 5.0 (Murtagh & Saunders 1983) and the 32 keyword-value syntax of MINOS 5.4, Lancelot (Conn, Gould & Toint 1992), and PATH <ref> (Dirkse & Ferris 1994) </ref>. The GAMS user can specify whether an options file is to be used by setting the optfile option. This logical value is passed to the solver via a call to cpgetl, using the "optfil" string. <p> Once the solver has been compiled into an executable format, GAMS must be made aware of it, and arrangements must be made to call the executable properly. Details of how this is done on a PC running DOS are discussed in <ref> (Dirkse et al. 1994) </ref>. The details for a UNIX installation are quite similar. 2.2.4 The C Interface On many platforms, the Fortran CPLIB can be used in conjunction with solvers written in the C programming language.

The GAMS user can specify whether an options file is to be used by setting the optfile option. This logical value is passed to the solver via a call to cpgetl, using the "optfil" string. <p> Cao & Ferris (1992) describe a scheme whereby the lineality of the feasible set B can be factored out, and a new problem solved over a reduced space. The full rank condition on M f is a necessary condition in that context. However, in a more recent paper <ref> (Cao & Ferris 1994) </ref>, the lineality is removed under a copositive-plus assumption only. Neither of 83 84 these techniques is currently included in PATH, since this case has not occurred in practice.

Reference-contexts: The GAMS Callable Program Library (CPLIB) is an interface designed to simplify and speed the process of hooking up complementarity solvers for use as GAMS/MCP solution subsystems. CPLIB is a set of Fortran routines that use the GAMS I/O library <ref> (Kalvelagen 1992) </ref> to read and write the binary instruction files used to communicate between GAMS and a solver. The I/O library also contains routines to evaluate the constraint function and its gradient, using the instructions found in the instruction files.

Reference-contexts: When the feasible set B = IR n + , the approximation (4.6) reduces to the linear complementarity problem (LCP), to which Lemke's method can be applied. We now consider Lemke's method as a path construction technique. In Lemke's method <ref> (Lemke 1965, Cottle & Dantzig 1968) </ref>, an extra column (called a covering vector) is added to the matrix M , along with an artificial variable . Typically, the covering vector is taken to be the unit vector e.

Reference-contexts: Note also that GE is an equivalent formulation of VI, expressed in terms of the normal cone. Josephy (1979b) describes a Newton method for GE in which the linearizations obtained by replacing F with A k are solved to obtain the successive iterates. Under an assumption of strong regularity <ref> (Robinson 1980) </ref> at a solution z and an assumption regarding the Lipschitz continuity of F 0 , Josephy (1979b) shows that a domain of attraction result holds for Newton's method for GE, and that quadratic convergence is achieved.

Unfortunately, this may greatly increase the problem size and disguise any special problem structure.

Reference-contexts: Although specialized techniques can solve ELQP's quickly, we show that a frequently occurring special case of ELQP can be reformulated as an equivalent MCP, without any increase in size or loss of special structure. In a common practical situation <ref> (Rockafellar & Wets 1986b, Rockafellar & Wets 1986a, Rockafel-lar 1990) </ref>, the feasible sets U and V are rectangular. In this case, the VI (T; U fi V ) defined by (3.16) is one involving only rectangular constraints, so that no reformulation is necessary to solve the problem as an MCP.

Reference-contexts: Section 2 of <ref> (Tobin 1988) </ref> gives the following conditions for a spatial price equilibrium (SPE): Nonnegative flows, prices, demands, & supplies: t ak 0; lk 0; D lk 0; S lk 0 8 a; l; k (3.6a) Conservation of flow at each node: S lk + i X t (lj)k 8 l; k (3.6b) <p> A similar result is proved by Friesz, Tobin, Smith & Harker (1983); there, the inequality in (3.8) is not strict, and as a result, the optimal prices need not be positive; the equivalence between the NCP solution and the SPE still holds. In <ref> (Tobin 1988) </ref>, the positivity of the optimal prices is said to follow from the weaker version of (3.8); this is false, as is easily shown by a small counterexample. Condition (3.8) is a reasonable one; we can expect demand to exceed supply when something is free.
