Abstract: Recently Ajtai described a construction of one-way functions whose security is equivalent to the difficulty of some well known approximation problems in lattices. We show that essentially the same construction can also be used to obtain collision-free hashing.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In a recent work <ref> [1] </ref> Ajtai described a problem that is hard on the average if some well-known lattice problems are hard to approximate in the worst case, and demonstrated how this problem can be used to construct one-way functions. <p> Another problem which can be shown to be equivalent to the above approximation problems (cf., <ref> [1] </ref>) is the following: (W3) Given an arbitrary basis B of a lattice L, find a set of n linearly independent lattice vectors, whose length is at most polynomially (in n) larger than the length of the smallest set of n linearly independent lattice vectors. (Again, the length of a set <p> Here, we used `A' (in the notation) to indicate that we will be interested in the average-case complexity of this problem. Ajtai proved the following theorem, reducing the worst-case complexity of (W3) to the average-case complexity of (A1): Ajtai's Theorem <ref> [1] </ref>: Suppose that it is possible to solve a uniformly selected instance of Problem (A1) in expected T (n; m; q)-time, where the expectation is taken over the choice of the instance as well as the coin-tosses of the solving algorithm. <p> Remark: Ajtai has noted that the theorem remain valid also when Problem (A1) is relaxed so that the desired output is allowed to have Euclidean norm of up to poly (n) (i.e., one requires kxk poly (n) rather than kxk &lt; n) <ref> [1] </ref>. 3 2.3 Our Version We observe that one can use essentially the same proof to prove that the following problem is also hard on the average Problem (A2): Parameters: n; m; q as in (A1). Input: A matrix M 2 Z nfim q . <p> Once so modified, Problem (A1) becomes more relaxed than Problem (A2) and so the current theorem follows. For the sake of self-containment we sketch the main ideas of the proof of Ajtai's Theorem (equiva lently, of Theorem 1) in Section 4. The reader is referred to <ref> [1] </ref> for further details. 3 Constructing Collision-Free Hash Functions Recall our construction of a family of collision-free hash functions: Picking a hash-function To pick a hash-function with security-parameters n; m; q (where n log q &lt; m q 2n 4 and q = O (n c )), we pick a random

To obtain a family of functions which is both universal and collision-free, we slightly modify the above construction. First we set q to be a prime of the desired size. <p> h M;r : f0; 1g m ! Z n q is then defined for s = s 1 s m 2 f0; 1g m ; h M (s) = M s + r (mod q) = r + i The modified construction resembles the standard construction of universal hash functions <ref> [2] </ref>, with calculations done over Z q instead of over Z 2 . 1 2 Formal Setting In this section we give a brief description of some well known lattice problems, describe Ajtai's reduction, and our version of it. 2.1 Lattices Definition 1: Given a set of n linearly independent vectors

Reference-contexts: Remark. Using our notation, the candidate one-way function introduced by Ajtai is f (M; s) def (M; h M (s)). We note that this function is regular (cf., <ref> [3] </ref>); that is, the number of preimage of any image is about the same.
