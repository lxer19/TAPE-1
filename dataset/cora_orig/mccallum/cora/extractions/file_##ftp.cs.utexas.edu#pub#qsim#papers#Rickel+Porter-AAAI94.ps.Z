Title: Automated Modeling for Answering Prediction Questions: Selecting the Time Scale and System Boundary

Abstract: The ability to answer prediction questions is crucial to reasoning about physical systems. A prediction question poses a hypothetical scenario and asks for the resulting behavior of variables of interest. Prediction questions can be answered by simulating a model of the scenario. An appropriate system boundary, which separates aspects of the scenario that must be modeled from those that can be ignored, is critical to achieving a simple yet adequate model. This paper presents an efficient algorithm for system boundary selection, it shows the important role played by the model's time scale, and it provides a separate algorithm for selecting this time scale. Both algorithms have been implemented in a compositional modeling program called tripel and evaluated in the plant physiology domain.

After computing the connectivity array, tripel searches for an adequate scenario model as described in Section 3. Extend-model consults the array for each system boundary decision.

Reference-contexts: To determine which combinations of candidate influences constitute an acceptable scenario model, the domain knowledge includes coherence constraints, which specify inconsistent combinations of modeling assumptions (e.g., assumption classes <ref> (Falkenhainer & Forbus 1991) </ref>). Once constructed, the scenario model is simulated starting from the initial state, and the model and simulation results are used to answer the question and explain the answer. 3 Modeling Algorithm The exogenous variables of a scenario model constitute its system boundary.

Reference-contexts: Model fragments specify relations among variables of the scenario. In plant physiology, influences are the most natural representation for such relations. An influence is a causal relation between two variables, as in Qualitative Process (QP) Theory <ref> (Forbus 1984) </ref>, 1 tripel is an acronym for "Tailoring Relevant Influences for Predictive and Explanatory Leverage." It is also a style of strong ale made by Trappist Monks in Belgium. along with its operating conditions (behavioral condi-tions under which it holds) and associated modeling assumptions. <p> in another variable in two ways: (1) with a differential influence, a specified value for the influencing variable (along with values for other influencing variables) provides the rate of change of the influenced variable; (2) in contrast, a functional influence can cause change only if the influencing variable is changing <ref> (Forbus 1984) </ref>. This implies that a driving variable can cause change in a variable of interest only if the influence path connecting them contains a differential influence or the behavioral conditions specify that the driving variable is changing (in which case a path of functional influences will propagate the change).

Reference-contexts: Each such method further reduces the number of potentially relevant variables and tightens the resulting system boundary. A more thorough evaluation requires more extensive domain knowledge. We are currently evaluating tripel using the Botany Knowledge Base <ref> (Porter et al. 1988) </ref>, which includes over 200 processes described at multiple levels of detail. We expect our methods to apply to a wide variety of domains. In addition to biological and ecological domains, time scale knowledge appears useful in engineering domains as well.

Reference-contexts: Falkenhainer and Forbus assume the system decomposition is based on partonomic structure; however, O'Neill et al. (1986) argue that approximate system boundaries in natural systems arise from differences in process rates and that these boundaries may not correspond to standard structural decompositions. Finally, as illustrated in our previous paper <ref> (Rickel & Porter 1992) </ref>, Falkenhainer and Forbus's approach to selecting system boundaries is not sufficiently sensitive to the connection between behavioral conditions and variables of interest. <p> Iwasaki (1990) has explored this approach. The work described in this paper builds on our previous methods for selecting a time scale and system boundary <ref> (Rickel & Porter 1992) </ref>. The previous methods had to keep track of all the particular interaction paths, which can be prohibitively expensive when there are many candidate influences.
