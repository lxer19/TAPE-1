Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for scheduling jobs in soft real-time systems. To simplify the scheduling for soft real-time systems, we introduce a tw o-level deadline scheme. Each job in the system has two deadlines, which we call fi rst-level and second-level deadlines, respectively. The fi rst-level deadline is the same as the deadline in traditional real-time systems. The second-level deadline is later than the fi rst-level deadline, and defi nes the latest point in time when the result is still acceptable. Partial-credit is given for jobs meeting the second-level deadline but missing the fi rst-level deadline, whereas jobs meeting the latter are given full credit. We heuristically compute priorities of jobs in a dynamic way by combining the fi rst-level and second-level deadlines and the partial-credit. Simulation results indicate that our tw o-level scheduling algorithm is a viableapproach for dealing with both soft real-time systems and temporary overload in hard real-time systems.

Reference-contexts: This concept is analogous to imprecise computation in hard real-time systems. Imprecise computation reduces the execution time of jobs to avoid missing their deadlines if the result is acceptable <ref> [1] </ref>. In our two-level deadline scheme, a deadline is extended, instead of reducing computation time, if the tardiness is acceptable.

Reference-contexts: H ow ever, in the real w orld, different job may have different values. The value of jobs is often overlooked in real-time systems, many of w hich simply focus on deadlines rather than a combination of value and deadlines <ref> [6] </ref>. In this section, w e assume that jobs may have different w eights (values). By this assumption, w e heuristically compute priorities for w eighted jobs at every time click. (Note that in the follow ing a job w ith a larger priority value has a low er priority.
