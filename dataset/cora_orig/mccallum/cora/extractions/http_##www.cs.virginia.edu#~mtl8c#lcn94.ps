Abstract: Support for digital audio and video streams (continuous media) in desktop computers is increasingly widespread and hence the demand for high-quality network distribution of continuous media streams is growing. While current local area and campus-wide networks have high-bandwidth links and powerful routers, the delay sensitivities of continuous media streams pose a challenge. Our paper provides an empirical investigation of the feasibility of transmitting real-time packet streams across a large extant campus network, the University of Virginia campus network. This network is representative of contemporary large enterprise networks consisting of Ethernet segments connected by high-performance routers to high-speed backbones, e.g., FDDI rings. We evaluate the network capability for supporting interactive packet voice, an important and demanding application domain. We obtain delay measurements for three specific paths in the network, and these measurements are used to examine the voice protocol parameters for this environment, including a novel retransmission-based error control proposed in [9]. We conclude that voice distribution is generally feasible in our campus-wide network, though we also find evidence of problematic delay behavior.

Reference-contexts: Determining the control time at the packet voice receiver is difficult since it requires knowledge of the network delay distribution. Numerous methods have been proposed for estimating the control time of a talkspurt, based on network delay measurements [17], on stochastic assumptions about the network delay <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, or both [18]. 2.4 Error Control The impact of packet loss on voice quality varies since interpolation can mitigate the effects of lost samples.

Reference-contexts: Conventional error control techniques are unacceptable since they do not consider the delay sensitivity of voice data. Hence, researchers have dismissed a retransmission-based approach to error control, focusing instead on open-loop techniques that recover or limit the 4 effects of losses. Forward error correction (FEC) <ref> [3, 19] </ref> provides robustness in the presence of packet losses by adding redundant information to the original samples. If only a small number of packets is lost, the added redundancy enables a reconstruction of the original voice data at the receiver.

Reference-contexts: High-quality voice applications require less than 200 ms roundtrip delays, but delays of up to 600 ms have been shown to be acceptable [15]. Recent CCITT guidelines <ref> [6] </ref> suggest that even roundtrip delays of up to 800 ms have a limited impact on quality. The requirement for bounded roundtrip delay as measured by the application translates into a protocol-level requirement for bounding one-way delay.

Reference-contexts: Typical packetization intervals range from 10 50 ms [20]. Given a fixed packetization interval, the encoding scheme determines the actual number of bits per packet. The ubiquitous pulse code modulation (PCM) encoding scheme for voice <ref> [7] </ref> samples every 125 s with 8 bits per sample to yield a 64 kbit/s channel. Bandwidth reduction can be achieved through the use of fewer bits per sample, less frequent sampling, and compression of the digitized data.

Reference-contexts: Bandwidth reduction can be achieved through the use of fewer bits per sample, less frequent sampling, and compression of the digitized data. Adaptive differential pulse code modulation (ADPCM) <ref> [8] </ref>, for example, encodes only the difference between consecutive samples, reducing the number of bits per sample to 2 5 bits. Coding techniques with even lower bit rates, e.g., Linear Predictive Coding (LPC), exist, though speech fidelity is frequently poor [14].

Reference-contexts: Empirical measurements of the network show that voice distribution is generally feasible. We explore the design trade-offs for a packet voice protocol in this environment and quantify the achievable transmission quality using our data. In our protocol evaluation we consider a novel retransmission-based error control scheme proposed in <ref> [9, 10] </ref>. Our study indicates that, contrary to current wisdom, retransmission can provide significant error coverage for packet voice while respecting the delay constraints of the voice stream. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. <p> A drawback to channel coding, however, is that the network is required to support selective dropping of packets during periods of congestion, a functionality not available in current LANs. A novel retransmission-based approach to error control for packet voice is proposed in <ref> [9, 10] </ref>. The technique hinges on extending the control time at the receiver such that retransmissions are made feasible. This scheme is designed to enhance the transmission quality by recovering lost packets through retransmission when this recovery can be performed without violating the delay constraints of the packet stream.

Reference-contexts: A major problem appears to be performance degradation due to periodic routing messages, in line with the observations in <ref> [11] </ref>. We conclude that, due to the existence of high delay and delay variations in the network, some sophistication is justified in the algorithms used by the endsystem voice protocol for dealing with variable delay.

Reference-contexts: Even if short silence periods represent natural breaks in speech, variations in short silence periods due to control times are more noticeable than in long periods. The minimum intertalkspurt time, or hangover time, suggested in <ref> [13] </ref> is 100 ms. Determining the control time at the packet voice receiver is difficult since it requires knowledge of the network delay distribution. <p> Subsequent increases in the hangover time cause a more gradual increase in the duration of talkspurts and silence periods. We conclude that, to achieve silence periods of relatively long durations (i.e., 250-300 ms), a hangover time of around 100 ms is necessary, in line with <ref> [13] </ref>. 3.3 Packet Delay Real-time applications are sensitive to network delays and variations in these delays. In this section we present the delays observed for transmissions over three different paths through the campus-wide network. Ideally, we would like to measure the network delay experienced by each packet.

Since speech is actually an alternating series of activity periods, or talkspurts, followed by silence periods, another technique to reduce the network bandwidth consumed by a voice channel is the suppression of transmissions during silence periods.

Packet delays were measured by a software-based network monitoring tool <ref> [16] </ref> running on an Intel 486 workstation, which was attached to the same local-area network as the traffic-generating workstation. This network monitor node captures each packet on the local network segment and timestamps the packet with a clock accuracy of 1 ms.
