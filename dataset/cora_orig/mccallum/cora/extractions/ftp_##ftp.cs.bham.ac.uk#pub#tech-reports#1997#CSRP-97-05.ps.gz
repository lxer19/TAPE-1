Abstract: Technical Report: CSRP-97-5 School of Computer Science The University of Birmingham Abstract In this paper we present an approach to the interactive development of programs for image enhancement with Genetic Programming (GP) based on pseudo-colour transformations. In our approach the user drives GP by deciding which individual should be the winner in tournament selection. The presence of the user does not only allow running GP without a fitness function but it also transforms GP into a very efficient search procedure capable of producing effective solutions to real-life problems in only hundreds of evaluations. In the paper we also propose a strategy to further reduce user interaction: we record the choices made by the user in interactive runs and we later use them to build a model which can replace him/her in longer runs. Experimental results with interactive GP and with our user-modelling strategy are also reported.

Reference-contexts: Graf and Banzhaf [Graf and Banzhaf, 1995] have recently applied a similar strategy to breed 2-D images and 3-D solid objects interactively using a tiepoint-based representation within a GA. Biles <ref> [Biles, 1994] </ref> used a GA to evolve jazz solos on the basis of a numeric fitness value defined, entirely subjectively, by a user. Most of the work summarised above has been motivated by the desire to produce computer art using EAs.

Reference-contexts: This strategy avoids imposing the use of total or partial orders on the decisions made by the user. The application chosen for this study was to extend and automate, using GP, the pseudo-colouring techniques described in <ref> [Cagnoni et al., 1991] </ref> where multiple gray-scale images were combined into a single pseudo-colour image in which some structures of interest were emphasised.

Reference-contexts: In his seminal work [Sims, 1991], Sims used Lisp S-expressions with several different mutation operators to evolve programs which produced images and animations on the basis of a user aesthetic criteria. Das et al. <ref> [Das et al., 1994] </ref> used Sims's ideas to represent and evolve interactively 3-D objects and sounds within a virtual-reality environment with GP (including also a recombination operator).

Reference-contexts: This seems the most natural approach when only qualitative/subjective information (such as that provided by humans whose expertise is difficult to elicit and formalise) is available or when the desired output for the program to be induced is not known at all. For example, Dawkins <ref> [Dawkins, 1987] </ref> evolved biomorphs (insect-like creatures) with an algorithm similar to evolution strategies in which the user selected which creature would be used to produce a new generation.

The model could be used to process the majority of the individuals in the population. Many variations between these fully off-line and fully on-line modes seem possible.

Reference-contexts: One way of running EAs when a scalar fitness function is not available is to try and induce one from a corpus of available data using machine learning techniques. This method has been used in <ref> [Spector and Alpern, 1995] </ref>, where a set of real jazz-fragments was used to train a neural network. The network was later used to define a fitness function for a GP-based music generation system: the network played the role of a critic, GP was the musician.
