Reference-contexts: If I C1 is too low, however, 1 g m1 components in the noise begin to dominate. The optimal value of I C1 is found empirically through SPICE simulation as approximately 200A, setting R E = 4k. An alternative is to replace both input devices with an NMOS transistor <ref> [1] </ref>. A MOS input will exhibit negligible shot noise and at low frequencies will have superior current input noise performance. By sizing W L we can also adjust the desired level shift at the input.

Reference-contexts: The shunt feedback provides a low output impedance to voltage drive the single-ended to differential output stage. 3 Input stage design The analysis of the Darlington local shunt feedback stage is similar to the analysis of the single transistor feedback stage <ref> [3] </ref>.
