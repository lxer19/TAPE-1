Reference-contexts: a language A f0; 1g fl is the function CS A : N ! N defined as follows: For each n 2 N, CS A (n) is the minimum size (number of gates) required for an n-input, 1-output Boolean (acyclic, combinational) circuit to decide the set A =n . (See <ref> [Lut92a, BDG88, Weg87] </ref> for details of the circuit model, which can be varied in minor ways without affecting this discussion.) Circuit-size complexity has been investigated extensively for over forty years.

Reference-contexts: Note also that, if t (n) = O (s (n)), then every DSPACE (s (n))-complexity core of A is a DSPACE (t (n))-complexity core of A. Remark. Definition 8 quantifies over all machines consistent with A, while the standard definition of complexity cores (cf. <ref> [BDG90] </ref>) quantifies only over machines that decide A. This difference renders Definition 8 stronger than the standard definition when A is not recursive. For example, consider tally languages (i.e., languages A f0g fl ).

Reference-contexts: This enables one to eliminate the extraneous hypothesis that A is recursive from several results. In some cases (e.g., the fact that A is P-bi-immune if and only if f0; 1g fl is a P-complexity core for A <ref> [BS85] </ref>), this improvement is of little interest. However in x6 below, we show that every P m -hard language H for ESPACE has unusually small complexity cores, hence unusually low space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. This upper bound holds regardless of whether H is recursive.

Reference-contexts: In x3 below we summarize those aspects of resource-bounded measure that are used in this paper. Kolmogorov complexity, discussed in several papers in this volume, was introduced by Solomonoff [Sol64], Kolmogorov [Kol65], and Chaitin <ref> [Cha66] </ref>. Resource-bounded Kolmogorov complexity has been investigated extensively [Kol65, Har83, Sip83, Lev84, Lon86, BB86, Huy86, Ko86, AR88, All89, AW90, Lut90, Lut92a, etc.]. In this paper we work with the space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity of languages.

Reference-contexts: In particular, much is known about the distribution of Kolmogorov complexities in ESPACE [Lut92a, x4 below], while very little is known at lower complexity levels. Second, the structure of ESPACE is closely related to the structure of polynomial complexity classes. For example, Hartmanis and Yesha <ref> [HY84] </ref> have shown that E $ ESPACE () P $ P=Poly " PSPACE: This, together with the first reason, suggests that the separation of P from PSPACE might best be achieved by separating E from ESPACE. We thus seek a detailed, quantitative account of the structure of ESPACE. <p> 11 By Theorem 3 (a), this implies that almost every language A 2 ESPACE is "very hard to approximate with circuits." This fact, together with the result of Nisan and Wigderson, immediately yields an upward measure separation theorem, stating that P 6= BPP ) (EjESPACE) = 0: (Hartmanis and Yesha <ref> [HY84] </ref> had previously shown that P 6= BPP ) E$ ESPACE.) In each of the above examples, space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity is used to prove that some set Z of languages has measure 1 in ESPACE.

Reference-contexts: Such problems are correctly regarded as exceedingly complex. They are provably intractable in terms of computational time and space. They have exponential circuit-size complexity [Kan82], weakly exponential space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity <ref> [Huy86] </ref>, and dense complexity cores [OS86, Huy87]. Problems that are P m -hard for ESPACE have all these properties and need not even be recursive. <p> In x6, we apply these results to our main topic, which is the complexity and distribution of P m -hard problems for ESPACE. It is well-known that such problems are not feasibly decidable and must obey certain lower bounds on their complexities. As noted above, Huynh <ref> [Huy86] </ref> has proven that every P m -hard for ESPACE has weakly exponential (i.e., &gt; 2 n * for some * &gt; 0) space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity; and Orponen and Schoning [OS86] have (essentially) proven that every P m -hard language for ESPACE has a dense DSPACE (2 cn )- complexity core. <p> Proof. By Theorem 14, H " fA f0; 1g fl jKS 2 2n (A =n ) &gt; 2 n n a.e.g = ;, so this follows from Corollary 7. Kolmogorov Complexity, Cores, and Hardness 21 7 Conclusion Very roughly speaking, our results (together with earlier work of <ref> [OS86, Huy86] </ref>) admit the following simple summary. We use KS (A =n ) and jK =n j as measures of the complexity of a language A, where K is a "largest" complexity core for A.

Problems that are P m -hard for ESPACE have all these properties and need not even be recursive. Notwithstanding these lower bounds on the complexity of P m -hard problems for ESPACE, we will prove in x6 below that such problems are unusually simple in two respects.

The interested reader may wish to consult the technical paper <ref> [JL92] </ref> for a more thorough treatment of these issues. For example, it is shown in [JL92] that P m -hard problems for E have unusually small complexity cores, whence the P m -complete problems for E form a measure 0 subset of E.

In both measures, every hard language for ESPACE has complexity between 2 n * and 2 n 2 n * for infinitely many n. In fact <ref> [JL92] </ref>, these bounds are tight.

Reference-contexts: Juedes and Jack H. Lutz has a rich, well-behaved structure that is well enough understood that we can prove absolute results, unblemished by oracles or unproven hypotheses. In particular, much is known about the distribution of Kolmogorov complexities in ESPACE <ref> [Lut92a, x4 below] </ref>, while very little is known at lower complexity levels. Second, the structure of ESPACE is closely related to the structure of polynomial complexity classes. <p> The problem here is that ESPACE is a countable set of languages, so Pr A [A 2 ESPACE] = 0, so the conditional probability Pr (XjESPACE) is not defined. We thus turn to resource-bounded measure, a complexity-theoretic generalization of Lebesgue measure developed by Lutz <ref> [Lut92a, Lut92b] </ref>. Suppose we are given a resource bound, e.g., the set pspace, consisting of all functions computable in polynomial space. Then resource-bounded measure theory defines the pspace-measure pspace (X) of a set X of languages (provided that X is pspace-measurable). In all cases, 0 pspace (X) 1. <p> In all cases, 0 pspace (X) 1. If pspace (X) = 0 or pspace (X) = 1, then Pr (X) = 0 or Pr (X) = 1, respectively, but the pspace-measure conditions are much stronger than this: It is shown in <ref> [Lut92a, Lut92b] </ref> that, if pspace (X) = 0, then X " ESPACE is a negligibly small subset of ESPACE. In fact, pspace-measure induces a natural, internal, measure structure on ESPACE. <p> t (A n )<ref> [Lut92a] </ref>, we prove a new almost everywhere lower bound result (Theorem 6/Corollary 7) showing that for all c 2 N and * &gt; 0, almost every language A 2 ESPACE has space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity KS 2 cn (This improves the 2 n 2 *n lower bound of [Lut92a].) It should be noted that the proof of this result is the only direct use of resource-bounded measure in this paper. All the measure-theoretic results in x5-6 are proven by appeal to this almost everywhere lower bound on space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. <p> P m -hard or P m -complete for ESPACE. 3 Resource-Bounded Measure In this section we very briefly give some fundamentals of resource-bounded measure, where the resource bound is polynomial space. (This is the resource bound that endows ESPACE with measure structure.) For more details, examples, motivation, and proofs, see <ref> [Lut92a, Lut92b] </ref>. <p> Though the main results of this paper are true, the underlying development was technically flawed. This situation is remedied in <ref> [Lut92a, Lut92b] </ref>, where resource-bounded measure is reformulated in terms of density functions. We review relevant aspects of the latter formulation here. A density function is a function d : f0; 1g fl ! [0; 1) satisfying d (x) 2 for all x 2 f0; 1g fl . <p> In this case, we say that X contains almost every language in ESPACE. It is shown in <ref> [Lut92a, Lut92b] </ref> that these definitions endow ESPACE with internal measure-theoretic structure. <p> More importantly, it is shown that the ideal I ESPACE is a proper ideal, i.e., that ESPACE does not have measure 0 in ESPACE. Our proof of Theorem 6 below does not proceed directly from the above definitions. Instead we use a sufficient condition, proved in <ref> [Lut92a] </ref>, for a set to have pspace-measure 0. To state this condition we need a polynomial notion of convergence for infinite series. All our series here consist of nonnegative terms. <p> A series is p-convergent if it has a modulus that is a polynomial. The following sufficient condition for a set to have pspace-measure 0 is a special case (for pspace) of a resource-bounded generalization of the classical first Borel-Cantelli lemma. Lemma 2. (Lutz <ref> [Lut92a] </ref>). <p> We now recall the following almost-everywhere lower bound result. Theorem 3. (Lutz <ref> [Lut92a] </ref>). Let c 2 N and * &gt; 0. (a) If (A =n ) &gt; 2 n 2 *n a.e.g; then pspace (X) = (XjESPACE) = 1. (b) If (A n ) &gt; 2 n+1 2 *n a.e.g; then pspace (Y ) = (Y jESPACE) = 1. <p> a language A f0; 1g fl is the function CS A : N ! N defined as follows: For each n 2 N, CS A (n) is the minimum size (number of gates) required for an n-input, 1-output Boolean (acyclic, combinational) circuit to decide the set A =n . (See <ref> [Lut92a, BDG88, Weg87] </ref> for details of the circuit model, which can be varied in minor ways without affecting this discussion.) Circuit-size complexity has been investigated extensively for over forty years. <p> Lupanov named this phenomenon the Shannon effect. Lutz <ref> [Lut92a] </ref> used Theorem 3 to investigate the Shannon effect in ESPACE. The upper bound (4.3) applies a fortiori to languages in ESPACE, but the lower bound (4.2) does not directly say anything about ESPACE because Pr A [A 62 ESPACE] = 1 in the same random experiment. <p> However, it is not difficult to see that an upper bound on CS A (n) implies an upper bound on KS (A =n ). In fact, Lutz <ref> [Lut92a] </ref> showed that the quantitave details of this relation, combined with Theorem 3 (a), imply that, for every real ff &lt; 1, almost every language A 2 ESPACE (and, as a corollary, almost every language A f0; 1g fl ) has circuit-size complexity CS A (n) &gt; n ff log n <p> Theorem 4. There exist constants c 1 ; c 2 2 N such that every language A satis fies the following two conditions. (i) KS 2 n (ii) KS 2 c 2 n (Part (i) of Theorem 4 is well known and obvious. Part (ii), proven in <ref> [Lut92a] </ref>, extends a result of Martin-Lof [Mar71].) Since the bound of Theorem 3 (b) is considerably lower than that of (4.4), one might expect to improve Theorem 3 (b).

Reference-contexts: The problem here is that ESPACE is a countable set of languages, so Pr A [A 2 ESPACE] = 0, so the conditional probability Pr (XjESPACE) is not defined.

It is easy to show <ref> [Lut92b] </ref> that a set X of languages has classical Lebesgue measure 0 (i.e., probability 0 in the coin-tossing random experiment) if and only if there exists a null cover of X. In this paper we are interested in the situation where the null cover d is pspace-computable. Definition 1. <p> In this case, we say that X contains almost every language in ESPACE. It is shown in <ref> [Lut92a, Lut92b] </ref> that these definitions endow ESPACE with internal measure-theoretic structure.

Reference-contexts: All the measure-theoretic results in x5-6 are proven by appeal to this almost everywhere lower bound on space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. In x5 , we review the fundamental notion of a complexity core, introduced by Lynch <ref> [Lyn75] </ref> and investigated by many others [Du85, ESY85, Orp86, OS86, 4 David W. Juedes and Jack H. Lutz BD87, Huy87, RO87, BDR88, DB89, Ye90, etc.]. <p> This upper bound holds regardless of whether H is recursive. It should also be noted that standard existence theorems on complexity cores (e.g., every language A 62 P has an infinite P-complexity core <ref> [Lyn75] </ref>; every P m - hard language for E has a dense P-complexity core [OS86]) remain true under Definition 8. Thus no harm is done by quantifying over all machines consistent with A. Intuitively, a language is complex if it has very large complexity cores.

Reference-contexts: We are thus led to ask how tight the lower bounds of Theorem 3 are. We first consider Theorem 3 (b). Martin-Lof <ref> [Mar71] </ref> has shown that, for every real a &gt; 1, almost every language A f0; 1g fl has space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity KS 2 cn (In fact, Martin-Lof showed that this holds even in the absence of a space bound.) The following known bounds show that the lower bound (4.4) is tight. <p> Part (ii), proven in [Lut92a], extends a result of Martin-Lof <ref> [Mar71] </ref>.) Since the bound of Theorem 3 (b) is considerably lower than that of (4.4), one might expect to improve Theorem 3 (b).

Reference-contexts: For example, it is shown in [JL92] that P m -hard problems for E have unusually small complexity cores, whence the P m -complete problems for E form a measure 0 subset of E. (Note added in proof: Recently, Mayordomo <ref> [May91] </ref> has independently proven that the P m -complete problems for E form a measure 0 subset of E.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 12. For every P m -hard language H for ESPACE, there exist B; D 2 DSPACE (2 n ) such that D is dense and B = H " D. Proof. By a construction of Meyer <ref> [Mey77] </ref>, there is a language A 2 DSPACE (2 n ) that is incompressible by P m -reductions. For the sake of completeness, we review the construction of A at the end of this proof. First, however, we use A to prove Theorem 12.

Reference-contexts: We thus seek a detailed, quantitative account of the structure of ESPACE. For simplicity of exposition, we work with polynomial time, many-one reducibility (" P m -reducibility"), introduced by Karp [Kar72]. Problems that are P m -complete for ESPACE have been exhibited by Meyer and Stockmeyer <ref> [MS72] </ref>, Stockmeyer and Chandra [SC89], and others. Such problems are correctly regarded as exceedingly complex. They are provably intractable in terms of computational time and space. They have exponential circuit-size complexity [Kan82], weakly exponential space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity [Huy86], and dense complexity cores [OS86, Huy87].

Reference-contexts: Thus the Shannon effect holds with full force in ESPACE. Example 2. Nisan and Wigderson <ref> [NW88] </ref> proved that, if E contains a language A that is, in a certain technical sense, "very hard to approximate with circuits," then this language A can be used to construct a pseudorandom generator that is fast enough and secure enough to establish the condition P = BPP.

Reference-contexts: Such problems are correctly regarded as exceedingly complex. They are provably intractable in terms of computational time and space. They have exponential circuit-size complexity [Kan82], weakly exponential space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity [Huy86], and dense complexity cores <ref> [OS86, Huy87] </ref>. Problems that are P m -hard for ESPACE have all these properties and need not even be recursive. Notwithstanding these lower bounds on the complexity of P m -hard problems for ESPACE, we will prove in x6 below that such problems are unusually simple in two respects. <p> As noted above, Huynh [Huy86] has proven that every P m -hard for ESPACE has weakly exponential (i.e., &gt; 2 n * for some * &gt; 0) space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity; and Orponen and Schoning <ref> [OS86] </ref> have (essentially) proven that every P m -hard language for ESPACE has a dense DSPACE (2 cn )- complexity core. Intuitively, such results are not surprising, as we do not expect hard problems to be simple. <p> This upper bound holds regardless of whether H is recursive. It should also be noted that standard existence theorems on complexity cores (e.g., every language A 62 P has an infinite P-complexity core [Lyn75]; every P m - hard language for E has a dense P-complexity core <ref> [OS86] </ref>) remain true under Definition 8. Thus no harm is done by quantifying over all machines consistent with A. Intuitively, a language is complex if it has very large complexity cores. <p> Proof. By Theorem 14, H " fA f0; 1g fl jKS 2 2n (A =n ) &gt; 2 n n a.e.g = ;, so this follows from Corollary 7. Kolmogorov Complexity, Cores, and Hardness 21 7 Conclusion Very roughly speaking, our results (together with earlier work of <ref> [OS86, Huy86] </ref>) admit the following simple summary. We use KS (A =n ) and jK =n j as measures of the complexity of a language A, where K is a "largest" complexity core for A.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we say that almost every language in ESPACE is in some set X of languages if (XjESPACE) = 1. In x3 below we summarize those aspects of resource-bounded measure that are used in this paper. Kolmogorov complexity, discussed in several papers in this volume, was introduced by Solomonoff <ref> [Sol64] </ref>, Kolmogorov [Kol65], and Chaitin [Cha66]. Resource-bounded Kolmogorov complexity has been investigated extensively [Kol65, Har83, Sip83, Lev84, Lon86, BB86, Huy86, Ko86, AR88, All89, AW90, Lut90, Lut92a, etc.]. In this paper we work with the space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity of languages.

Reference-contexts: a language A f0; 1g fl is the function CS A : N ! N defined as follows: For each n 2 N, CS A (n) is the minimum size (number of gates) required for an n-input, 1-output Boolean (acyclic, combinational) circuit to decide the set A =n . (See <ref> [Lut92a, BDG88, Weg87] </ref> for details of the circuit model, which can be varied in minor ways without affecting this discussion.) Circuit-size complexity has been investigated extensively for over forty years.
