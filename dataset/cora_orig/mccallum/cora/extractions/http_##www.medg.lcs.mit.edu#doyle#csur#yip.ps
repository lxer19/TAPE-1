Abstract: Imagistic reasoning is a new paradigm for understanding sensory data and controlling environment based on the construction, interpretation, and manipulation of image-like, analog representations of physical systems. The reasoning is primarily perceptual and only secondarily symbolic. In the past decade, we have built several imagistic reasoners that perform at an expert level on scientific problems that defy current analytical methods, includ fl Supported in part by a NSF National Young Investigator Award ECS-935777.

Reference-contexts: The language of spatial aggregation allows us to write many imagistic reasoning programs in a compact and modular man 2 ner and facilitates their comparison and generalization. The scope of these programs|dynamics [2, 3], nonlinear control [6], mechanism kinematics <ref> [1] </ref>, and fluid mechanics [4]|suggests that spatial aggregation captures a generic type of imagistic reasoning. In spatial aggregation, sensory fields are grouped into classes whose members are equivalent relative to the properties of interest. Spatial aggregation relies on the continuity and locality of real-world fields.

Reference-contexts: The implementation is a small, fixed set of generic operators on the graph hierarchy, such as aggregation and classification, with a 3 mixed data-driven and model-driven control structure. A full description of spatial aggregation appears in Yip and Zhao <ref> [5] </ref>. Imagistic reasoning is a powerful strategy for mapping between analog signals generated by physical systems and discrete, symbolic representations of the systems. Spatial aggregation is only one of its many possible realizations. We are investigating new imagistic reasoning methods and new applications.
