Reference-contexts: Dependency tracing, however, will trace upstream of x because it treats the multiplier as a black box. A better technique for identifying suspects is to have the simulator record dependencies for each predicted value (Sophie <ref> [BBd82] </ref> provided one of the earliest examples of this approach). Thus, when a discrepancy is detected for variable z, the set of components and parameters that participated in z's predicted value are available in the dependency trail.

Reference-contexts: Time-Point Interpolation The basic problem here is that measurements represents an instant in time, but the interval-state covering that instant covers a potentially long interval of time, so its predictions are imprecise. To overcome this problem we adopt the technique of time-point interpolation from Berleant's dissertation <ref> [Ber91, p. 40-50] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This is an action item for future work. 2.2.6 KARDIO (Bratko et al.) 46 Compressed surface rules ~ Experts, literature ~ Causal model ~ surface rules 6 ? Simulation Induction Kardio is a medical expert system for diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias <ref> [BML89] </ref>. <p> By doing so, Bratko, Lavrac and Mozetic reaped 47 the reward of guaranteed completeness and correctness in the finally synthesized expert system. <ref> [BML89, Foreword] </ref> There is a lesson here that the model-based reasoning community has perhaps not sufficiently emphasized | that even for systems in which experience-based diagnosis is the norm, it is often easier to acquire and validate a model of the system than to acquire and validate a set of symptom!fault <p> The latter is probably more important when the problem is susceptible to some traditional approach, such as differential equations, but in physiology the freedom is probably more valuable. <ref> [BML89, p. 49] </ref> The above statement is important but misleading. <p> Some of the generated behaviors can be justified simply by lack of information in the model. Unfortunately, Qsim also generates unreal behaviors that are not justified by lack of information. <ref> [BML89, p. 48] </ref>. Although progress has been made on both limitations, it's not clear that the Kardio team would decide the question any differently today. Their model of cardiac electrical activity involves repetitive processes in time, some of which are asynchronous.

Reference-contexts: For small K the estimator "believes" the model; for large K it "believes" the measurement. A Kalman estimator is not functioning properly when the gain becomes small but the measurements still contain information necessary for the estimates. The filter is said to diverge under these conditions <ref> [Can86, p. 94] </ref>. Mimic and the Kalman filter differ fundamentally in the way that their respective process models handle uncertainty. <p> In fact, these modeling errors or `model mismatches' may even cause the estimator to diverge. In designing an estimator it is therefore important to evaluate the effect of the approximations made in the selection of the models. <ref> [Can86, p. 111] </ref> Kalman filters do not perform diagnosis, of course, but they can determine how well a given process model tracks the observations (by watching e (t)). <p> One obvious problem with this approach is the combinatorics | a potentially large number of filters is needed to represent all the types and combinations of faults to be diagnosed. Another problem is that tuning the Kalman estimator is considered an art <ref> [Can86, p. 93] </ref>. Candy also notes that the Kalman filter "is not a satisfactory (numerically) or efficient algorithm to employ because of the error covariance equations".

Reference-contexts: Candy <ref> [Can88, p. 322] </ref> gives a succinct description of the algorithm: The operation of the Kalman filter algorithm can be viewed as a predictor-corrector algorithm as in standard numerical integration. Referring to the algorithm in Table 2.1, we see the inherent timing in the algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps because programs do not structurally simulate pathophysiological processes, researchers have not considered inference in terms of model construction. William J. Clancey <ref> [Cla89] </ref> Clancey's observation above suggests that a diagnostic program should simulate the faulty process under observation, attempting to construct a model that tracks the physical situation. This is, in fact, a succinct description of Mimic's operation. This chapter describes the design of Mimic.

Reference-contexts: Davis has argued that this approach, which has been employed in numerous other research efforts, does not result in faster diagnostic performance and, more importantly, focuses attention away from the truly important research issue: the creation of a sequence of increasingly approximate models for use by a model-based reasoner <ref> [Dav89] </ref>. In one of the more spirited debates this author has witnessed, Keller defends the attacks on "knowledge compilation" and argues that it is more fruitful to view associational reasoning and model-based reasoning as opposite endpoints along a spectrum of approaches ranging from more compiled to less compiled [Kel90].

Reference-contexts: In this section we briefly review Forbus' theory of "across-time measurement interpretation" (ATMI) and then explain why and how Mimic takes a considerably different approach to the same problem. This comparison applies equally well to DeCoste's extension to ATMI, named DATMI <ref> [DeC90] </ref>. ATMI The ATMI theory requires two pieces of input: a total envisionment of the mechanism (a graph of all possible behaviors) and domain-specific criteria for quantizing numerical data into an initial qualitative description.

Reference-contexts: The debate is clearly not settled for there are strongly held views on both sides. 49 2.2.7 Modeling for Troubleshooting (Hamscher) Model-based diagnosis, as commonly described in the AI community <ref> [DH88] </ref>, requires models of structure and behavior of the mechanism under study. One might assume that an adequate structural model is simply a complete hierarchical description of subsystems and components, and that an adequate behavioral model is a detailed simulation model that predicts all the time-varying events/changes in the mechanism.

Reference-contexts: Mimic does not currently offer advice about what variables to measure or what inputs to perturb; the minimum-entropy method for measurement selection employed in GDE <ref> [dKW87] </ref> and Sherlock [dKW89] offer guidance in this area of future work. 3.5.5 Multiple-Fault Diagnosis Mimic makes a simplifying assumption that faults occur one-at-a-time with respect to the sampling rate. <p> Thus, when a discrepancy is detected for variable z, the set of components and parameters that participated in z's predicted value are available in the dependency trail. This basic idea is used in assumption-based truth maintenance <ref> [dKW87] </ref>. 5.3.3 Spurious Behaviors Qualitative simulation can predict behaviors that do not correspond to the solution of any ODE covered by the QDE. These are called spurious behaviors because they do not appear in any real mechanism that the QDE represents.

Reference-contexts: In this vein, Franke has developed CC, a model-building program that accepts a component-connection description of a physical system and translates it into the qualitative differential equations of Qsim <ref> [FD90] </ref>. This permits a domain expert to specify the model in terms that are more natural to the domain (components and connections) and ensures that the behavioral model is always consistent with the structural model.

Reference-contexts: Yet providing this ability to "read gauges" is a critical step towards building the next generation of intelligent computer-aided engineering systems : : : <ref> [For86] </ref> This problem, called measurement interpretation, arises in Mimic and other systems that attempt to translate observed behavior (including numerical data) into useful qualitative terms.

Reference-contexts: Since there are no readings for Amount-A or Netflow-A, Mimic cannot detect any discrepancies with Amount-A or its derivatives, so it must carry along all these states. Recent work by Fouche <ref> [Fou91] </ref> on aggregating such "irrelevant distinctions" apply to this problem and may help substantially.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the common method is to use a bank of Kalman filters in parallel, each one designed and tuned for a particular fault <ref> [FW89, MW89] </ref>. The filter yielding the smallest error e (t) represents the best-matching hypothesis. One obvious problem with this approach is the combinatorics | a potentially large number of filters is needed to represent all the types and combinations of faults to be diagnosed.

Reference-contexts: Mathematically, the inconsistency between the actual and expected behavior is expressed as residuals. Residuals are quantities that are nominally zero but become nonzero when faults or disturbances are present. While faults can be detected from a single residual, fault isolation requires a set of residuals <ref> [Ger92] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: While such models do support model-based diagnosis, they are also part of the problem. As Hamscher notes in a recent article about troubleshooting digital circuits <ref> [Ham91] </ref>, "existing methods for model-based troubleshooting have not previously scaled up to deal with complex digital circuits, in part because traditional circuit models do not represent aspects of the device that troubleshooters consider important." As Hamscher emphasizes, the important thing about developing a model for troubleshooting is not that it uses <p> In troubleshooting the idea is to detect discrepancies between the observed behavior of the real device and an idealized model of it; thus the predictions of interest are those that can be made efficiently from what we have observed and that could be significantly violated if the device were broken. <ref> [Ham91, p. 239] </ref> Temporal abstractions provide considerable leverage in the troubleshooting process, and just as they are important in certain types of digital circuits, they are also likely 50 to be important in certain types of continuous-variable dynamic systems. <p> Hamscher has emphasized this point, showing the value of using a representation that makes explicit the behavior at a high level of temporal abstraction <ref> [Ham91] </ref>. For example, although an instruction-level simulation of a microprocessor explicitly represents the logic levels present on the external bus at every clock edge, it does not reveal the simple fact that during normal operation those bus signals should be very active. <p> can be improved by basing the decision of refinement vs. decom position vs. probes on the current state of the diagnosis. 125 try refinements before decompositions, nor decompositions before probes; people clearly make use of the current state of the diagnosis to make this decision, and so should the program. <ref> [Ham91] </ref> Future work in this area should be guided by Hamscher's insight. 5.5.5 Scale-Space Filtering Noisy signals are a fact of life in process monitoring, but effective monitoring and diagnosis depend on either filtering out the noise or somehow accounting for noise when reasoning with noisy sensor readings.

Reference-contexts: The discrepancies are used by the hypothesis generator to decide how to modify the model, which is then simulated to see if its predictions are corroborated by future measurements. This is described in more detail in Chapter 3. 2.3.3 STEAMER Steamer <ref> [HHW84] </ref> was a research effort concerned with exploring the use of AI software and hardware technologies in the implementation of intelligent computer-based training systems.

Reference-contexts: Readers interested in a more complete description of these simulation methods should consult the papers by Kuipers on Qsim [Kui86], by Kuipers and Berleant on Q2 [KB88], and by Kay on dynamic envelopes <ref> [Kay91] </ref>. 3.3.1 Qualitative-Quantitative Simulation A behavior, in Qsim parlance, is a sequence of states alternating between states that represent a point in time and states that represent an interval in time. <p> Thus, Q2's predictions at measurement instants may still lack the desired precision. To overcome the weaknesses in range interval propagation, Mimic employs a second semiquantitative simulation technique called "dynamic envelopes", developed by Kay <ref> [Kay91] </ref>. This method replaces the use of the mean value theorem in Q2's propagation with explicit integration of a pair of bounding ordinary differential equations. These bounding ODEs are derived from the QDE and numerically integrated, yielding upper and lower bounds for state values. <p> Importantly, the Mimic framework allows this to be factored out as a distinct problem, so independent advances on this problem will benefit Mimic. 4.4 Vacuum Chamber The most detailed practical example of fault detection using Mimic is given in Kay's thesis on the dynamic envelope method <ref> [Kay91] </ref>, as described earlier in section 3.3.4 and implemented in Nsim. Kay illustrates the method through monitoring and diagnosis of a vacuum chamber using an early version of Mimic.

Reference-contexts: Koton's side-by-side comparison of two expert systems built for the same domain | one using heuristic knowledge, the other using model-based reasoning | offers a good example of this lesson <ref> [Kot85] </ref>. A fundamental difference in approach between Kardio and Mimic lies in the mathematical foundations of the respective simulators. Mimic builds upon Qsim, a simulation algorithm that implements a qualitative mathematics and guarantees sound predictions of all behaviors consistent with the semi-quantitative model.

Reference-contexts: If a malfunction exhibits behavior that corresponds to a spurious behavior of the normal model, it will not be recognized as a discrepancy. As Lackinger notes in his thesis <ref> [Lac91, p. 78] </ref>, the role of monitoring is to check if the purpose of the system is still fulfilled. Correct monitoring requires a model that generates only the desirable behaviors.

Reference-contexts: But system parameter values and significant events such as alarms are subject to random variability and, therefore, the precise time of occurrence of each new alarm following a malfunction is not fully predictable and is never the same even for identically ordered alarm sequences. <ref> [Mal87, p. 99] </ref> Mimic overcomes both forms of information loss through its use of semiquantita-tive simulation. First, measurements do not require a quantitative-to-qualitative conversion since predicted ranges are available for direct comparison. If there is a discrepancy, subsequent testing and discrimination of fault hypotheses still uses the unmodified measurement data. <p> To a lesser degree, this is the case even for multiple, simultaneous malfunctions. On the other hand, they have great difficulty reasoning in the reverse direction: that is, mapping from a complicated pattern of sen sor alarms back to causative faults. <ref> [Mal87] </ref> Like any other operator advisory system, Mimic was designed from the outset to assist the operator in the difficult task of diagnosis. However, unlike the methods in current industrial practice, Mimic forms a fault-model that accounts for the observations over time.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the common method is to use a bank of Kalman filters in parallel, each one designed and tuned for a particular fault <ref> [FW89, MW89] </ref>. The filter yielding the smallest error e (t) represents the best-matching hypothesis. One obvious problem with this approach is the combinatorics | a potentially large number of filters is needed to represent all the types and combinations of faults to be diagnosed.

Reference-contexts: increasing automation in the control room, Perrow emphasizes how important it is for an operator to understand his/her system: This computerization has the effect of limiting the options of the operator, how ever, and does not encourage broader comprehension of the system|a key re quirement for intervening in unexpected interactions. <ref> [Per84, p. 122] </ref> Steamer's main contributions are in the areas of training and human interface. Although these are not the focus of our research, Steamer is important in that it highlights the importance of visualizing the system, even the parts that aren't visible.

Reference-contexts: This usually requires the FDI designer to follow his work into the specific engineering field, either doing the implementation himself or working closely with those who do it. For this reason we also call applications a legitimate area of research. <ref> [PFC89, pages 13-14] </ref> The research presented here has been tested only on relatively simple systems simulated in the laboratory. The next logical step is to test our methods in an application 127 of realistic complexity and scale.

Reference-contexts: If Mimic knew the sign of the partial derivative of outflow with respect to drain-rate (with everything else remaining the same), then it could eliminate such nonsensical hypotheses. Weld's work on comparative analysis <ref> [Wel88a] </ref> and exaggeration [Wel88b] provides exactly what is needed | it determines how a mechanism will react to perturbations in a parameter. By adding such perturbation analysis at hypothesis-generation time, Mimic can reduce the number of hypotheses to be modeled, tracked, and refuted.
