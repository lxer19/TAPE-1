Abstract: This global representation is able to incorporate all the relevant information for monitoring and supervising the manufacturing. In addition it should provide the operator interface with all the information required by the operator. Finally, such an object-based architecture will constitute an open representational system, which is able to represent additional information and knowledge when found useful or necessary.
