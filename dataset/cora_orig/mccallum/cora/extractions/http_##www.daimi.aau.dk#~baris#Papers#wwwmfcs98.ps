Abstract: fbaris,mng@brics.dk Abstract. Open maps have been used for defining bisimulations for a range of models, but none of these have modelled real-time. We define a category of timed transition systems, and use the general framework of open maps to obtain a notion of bisimulation. We show this to be equivalent to the standard notion of timed bisimulation. Thus the abstract results from the theory of open maps apply, e.g. the existence of canonical models and characteristic logics. Here, we provide an alternative proof of decidability of bisimulation for finite timed transition systems in terms of open maps, and illustrate the use of open maps in presenting bisimulations.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction During the past decade, a number of formalisms for real-time systems have been introduced and studied, e.g. the timed automata <ref> [AD90] </ref> and timed process algebras [Wan90]. A great deal of the theory of untimed systems has been lifted successfully to the setting of formalisms modelling real-time behaviour of systems.

Reference-contexts: These will be the objects of our category. A timed transition system is basically a timed automata without a set of accepting states and acceptance condition. R.Alur and D.L.Dill <ref> [AD94] </ref> call this a timed transition table. Definition 1 (Timed Transition Systems) A timed transition system is a quintuple (S; ; s 0 ; X; T ) where Sis a set of states and s 0 is the initial state. is a finite alphabet of actions. <p> 0 such that [[j 1 ( 0 )]] X 2 2 [[ffi 2 ]] X 2 , then there exists a transition s 1 oe 1 such that m (s 0 1 ) = s 0 To get a decidable characterisation of openness we introduce the notion of re gions, <ref> [AD94] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we study the notion of bisimulation [Mil89] for timed transition systems. The notion of bisimulation for timed models has already been introduced and studied by many researchers, e.g. in [Wan90,AKLN95,NSY93]. Timed bisimulation was shown decidable for finite timed transition systems by Cerans in <ref> [ Cer92] </ref>, and since then more efficient algorithms have been discovered [LLW95,WL97] and implemented in tools for automatic verification [KN94]. <p> fortunately, this property does not generalise to the setting of timed transition ? Basic Research in Computer Sciencs, Centre of the Danish National Research Foun dation systems, where bisimulations are defined in terms of the uncountable unfolded version of given timed transition systems, and where the decision procedures from e.g. <ref> [ Cer92] </ref> produce relations over nontrivial regional constructions The contribution of this paper is first and foremost to show the applicability of the general categorical framework of bisimulations in terms of open maps from [JNW96]. This framework has already been applied successfully to (re)define a number of observational equivalences [CN96]. <p> We show this notion of bisimulation to coincide with the standard timed bisimulation from <ref> [ Cer92] </ref>, and hence we may apply the general results from [JNW96] to this standard notion. Furthermore, we show within the framework of open maps that bisimilarity is decidable for finite timed transition systems.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, we do not claim that our alternative decision procedure as presented here is more efficient than existing ones, e.g. [LLW95,WL97]. We have used the same method for timed transition systems extended by invariants on the states <ref> [HN98] </ref>, and the method proved to be robust under this kind of extension.

Reference-contexts: the uncountable unfolded version of given timed transition systems, and where the decision procedures from e.g. [ Cer92] produce relations over nontrivial regional constructions The contribution of this paper is first and foremost to show the applicability of the general categorical framework of bisimulations in terms of open maps from <ref> [JNW96] </ref>. This framework has already been applied successfully to (re)define a number of observational equivalences [CN96]. Here we define a category of timed transition systems, where the morphisms are to be thought of as simulations, and an accompanying path (sub)category of timed words, which, following [JNW96], provides us with a notions <p> terms of open maps from <ref> [JNW96] </ref>. This framework has already been applied successfully to (re)define a number of observational equivalences [CN96]. Here we define a category of timed transition systems, where the morphisms are to be thought of as simulations, and an accompanying path (sub)category of timed words, which, following [JNW96], provides us with a notions of open maps and a bisimulation with a number of useful properties, like a canonical (presheaf) model, and a characteristic (modal) logic. <p> We show this notion of bisimulation to coincide with the standard timed bisimulation from [ Cer92], and hence we may apply the general results from <ref> [JNW96] </ref> to this standard notion. Furthermore, we show within the framework of open maps that bisimilarity is decidable for finite timed transition systems. <p> In Section 2 a category of timed transition systems and a path subcategory are defined, and they are shown to have the required properties for applying the approach of <ref> [JNW96] </ref>. Next, in Section 3 the resulting notion of bisimulation is studied, and shown to coincide with the standard notion of timed bisimulation. Finally, in Section 4 we provide a new proof of the decidability of timed bisim-ulation and illustrate the use of open maps to express bisimulations. <p> The morphisms of our category will be simulation morphisms following the ap-proach of <ref> [JNW96] </ref>. This leads to the following definition of a morphism. <p> 4 Given a timed word ff and a timed transition system T , there is a one to one correspondence between runs of ff and morphisms T ff (m;j) 3 Timed Bisimulation Given our category of timed transition systems and the path category we can use the general framework from <ref> [JNW96] </ref> to define our notions of open maps and bisimulation. Definition 9 (Open Map [JNW96]) A morphism T (m;j) ! T 0 is open iff for all T ff ! T with T ff 2 CTTS TW and all morphisms T ff (f;j f ) in CTTS TW such that the <p> is a one to one correspondence between runs of ff and morphisms T ff (m;j) 3 Timed Bisimulation Given our category of timed transition systems and the path category we can use the general framework from <ref> [JNW96] </ref> to define our notions of open maps and bisimulation. Definition 9 (Open Map [JNW96]) A morphism T (m;j) ! T 0 is open iff for all T ff ! T with T ff 2 CTTS TW and all morphisms T ff (f;j f ) in CTTS TW such that the square T ff (p;j p ) (f;j f ) T ** (q;j q ) <p> Definition 10 Two timed transition systems T 1 and T 2 are T W-bisimilar iff there exists a span T 1 (m;j) (m 0 ;j 0 ) ! T 2 with vertex T of open morphisms. It follows from <ref> [JNW96] </ref> and Theorem 2 that T W-bisimulation is the equivalence generated by open maps. The `standard' notion of timed bisimulation is defined in terms of configura tions. <p> This opens up a number of possibilities of applying general results from the categorical setting to concrete timed bisimulations, like the one studied here. One particularly interesting example is the characteristic path logic obtained from <ref> [JNW96] </ref>. Properties of this logic and its relation to other timed logics will be subject to future work. We also propose the span of open maps idea as a useful way of expressing timed bisimulations.

Reference-contexts: Timed bisimulation was shown decidable for finite timed transition systems by Cerans in [ Cer92], and since then more efficient algorithms have been discovered [LLW95,WL97] and implemented in tools for automatic verification <ref> [KN94] </ref>. These results like most other results concerning verification of real-time systems build on the region construction [AD90,AD94] which makes it possible to express the uncountable behaviour of a real-time system in a finite way.

Reference-contexts: As examples, many results from automata theory apply also to timed automata, [AD90,AD94,ACM97], and a number of timed versions of classical specification logics have been studied, [AH91,LLW95]. In this paper we study the notion of bisimulation <ref> [Mil89] </ref> for timed transition systems.
