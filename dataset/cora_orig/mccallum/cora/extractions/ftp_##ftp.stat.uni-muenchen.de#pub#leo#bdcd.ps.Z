Reference-contexts: The prior model does not 7 support every conceivable form of a cluster. Nevertheless, our approach has a nonparametric justification: A convenient feature of similar piecewise constant model formulations is that Bayesian point estimates do not belong to the prior model, which identifies those methods as essentially nonparametric <ref> (Arjas, 1996, Heikkinen and Arjas, 1998a) </ref>. This property is recognized mainly for continuous space but is transferable to the discrete case as well.

Reference-contexts: More generally one might also be interested in detecting discontinuities in the map, i.e. suspicious differences in relative risk between adjacent regions. However, results from the convolution model are often used to visually identify disease clusters, if the estimated risks exhibit a spatial pattern <ref> (e.g. Besag, York and Mollie, 1991, Mollie, 1996) </ref>. In these 4 cases, the Markov random field prior, which represents spatially structured heterogeneity, is dominating and the SMR's are essentially spatially smoothed. For that reason, Clayton and Bernardinelli (1993) denote the Markov random field term the "clustering component".

Reference-contexts: The latter two seem to be linked and in fact, most parts of southern Germany, excluding southern Bavaria, have an elevated relative risk above 1.0. The most important risk factors for oropharyngeal cancers are tobacco smoking and alcohol abuse <ref> (Blot et al., 1994) </ref>. The Mecklenburg-West Pomerania cluster is consistent with this, because this country has the highest per capita alcohol consumption of whole Germany (Becker and Wahrendorf, 1997).

Reference-contexts: Note that in the limiting case k = 1 there is constant relative risk over the whole area whereas for k = n not even two (contiguous) regions have the same relative risk. We postulate the usual Poisson observation model <ref> (e.g. Clayton and Bernardinelli, 1993) </ref>, where y i has Poisson distribution with mean e i h j and h j is the unknown relative risk in cluster j with i 2 C j .

Reference-contexts: For that reason, Clayton and Bernardinelli (1993) denote the Markov random field term the "clustering component". This paper describes a new approach for the detection of clusters in disease maps. Technically, the method is based on reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology <ref> (Green, 1995) </ref> and is related to the segmentation of a spatial signal, already tackled in Green. His work has been refined by Arjas and Heikkinen (1997) and Heikkinen and Arjas (1998a) who use piecewise constant step functions defined through marked point processes in continuous space. <p> Note that the switch move would be redundant for the Voronoi tessellation prior in Green (1995) but not here where distance ties are common. Each move is accepted as the new state of the Markov chain with probability determined by the Metropolis-Hastings-Green ratio <ref> (Green, 1995) </ref>. Below we describe some features of our implementation of these five elementary moves. More details are given in the Appendix. The main reason for choosing those moves was that they appeared to be straightforward to implement, each of them maintaining reversibility.

Reference-contexts: This problem might be even more severe for fixed k, since the birth and death moves are known to improve mixing <ref> (Heikkinen and Arjas, 1998a) </ref>. We routinely start several chains with different starting configurations and compare the results.
