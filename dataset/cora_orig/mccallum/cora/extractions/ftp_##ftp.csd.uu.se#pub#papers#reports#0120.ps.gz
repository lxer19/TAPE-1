Reference-contexts: Another interesting point in the characterization of provability using constraints is that such a characterization can be generalized to include built-in relations, for example arithmetical relations, in intuitionistic theorem provers. In [27] the technique of this paper is developed for intuitionistic logic with equality. In <ref> [4] </ref> we prove some complexity results related to intuitionistic logic with equality. In the case of arbitrary built-in predicates, it is hard to expect either the tableau method or the inverse method to eagerly find a substitution closing a derivation.

Reference-contexts: The use of constraints in automated deduction is investigated in many papers (see the survey by Kirchner <ref> [11] </ref>). In this article, we consider the use of constraints in intuitionistic logic. In particular, we obtain some complexity results for the problem of the instantiation of derivation skeletons and for the prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm we use in the proof is a modification of the unification algorithm of Martelli and Montanari <ref> [14] </ref>. It transforms the input constraint C step by step into a constraint of a special form for which satisfiability or unsatisfiability can easily be checked. Each transformation step yields a constraint equivalent to C. Here we give a direct proof for arbitrary constraints. <p> In fact, in classical logic every formula is effectively equivalent to a prenex formula. 26 Section 6 Conclusion and related work The idea to use constraints instead of substitutions is used in many areas of automated deduction. It is presented in the unification algorithm of Martelli and Montanari <ref> [14] </ref>, it is used in the semantics of logic programs, for example in Gabbrielli, Dore and Levi [6], and Maher [13].

Reference-contexts: In our paper, the use of constraints instead of explicit substitutions gives a polynomial time procedure instead of an exponential time procedure. When it comes to built-in relations, the use of constraints can result in more essential speedup as noted in Nieuwenhuis and Rubio <ref> [17] </ref>. Their paper has shown how to use an NP-complete constraint satisfaction problem instead of constructing a double exponential number of minimal AC-unifiers. Our technique can be used for other non-classical logics, for example some modal logics.

(In fact, the method of Shankar <ref> [21] </ref> does not even give a decision procedure, unless it is suitable modified.) Our technique allows us to find a polynomial space decision procedure for this fragment.

Reference-contexts: Proof. By straightforward analysis of inference rules of LG c . 2 Theorem 5.9 The prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic is PSPACE-complete. 25 Proof. Since intuitionistic propositional logic is already PSPACE-hard (Statman <ref> [22] </ref>), we conclude that the prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic is PSPACE-hard. Thus, we have to show that this fragment is in PSPACE. Let = (Q 1 x 1 : : : Q n x n ') be any prenex formula, where ' is quantifier-free.

Our characterization of intuitionistic provability is more simple than that of Wallen [28] and can be used for constructing a family of sequent-based proof procedures, <p> For the connection method, such a characterization was developed by Wallen <ref> [28] </ref>. Our characterization is based on derivation skeletons and constraint satisfaction. We use constraints to design a machine-oriented version LJ c of the intuitionistic sequent calculus. Our characterization of intuitionistic provability is more simple than that of Wallen [28] and can be used for constructing a family of sequent-based proof procedures, for example a tableau-based procedure, an inverse method-based procedure and their modifications on the basis of LJ c . <p> In particular, we obtain some complexity results for the problem of the instantiation of derivation skeletons and for the prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic. It is generally well-known how to design sequent-based proof-procedures for intuitionistic logic. For example, a matrix characterization has been developed by Wallen <ref> [28] </ref>, a tableau-based proof procedure has been described by Shankar [21] and systems based on the inverse method have been given in Voronkov [26] and Tammet [23]. Related logical papers are Vorob'ev [24, 25], Kanger [9], Maslov [15], Dyckhoff [5], Hudelmaier [8] and Miglioli, Moscato and Ornaghi [16]. <p> In the matrix characterization of Wallen <ref> [28] </ref>, provability is characterized in terms of a multiplicity (the number of copies of subformulas to be used), existence of a substitution and certain ordering restrictions. The ordering restrictions are supposed to encode the order of the application of inference rules in LJ.
