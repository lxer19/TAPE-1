Reference-contexts: The equation (1.6) is Ampere's law, rfiB = (4=c)J; see <ref> [5, Chapter 5] </ref>. Our numerical approximations are set up to simulate three-dimensional rectangular configurations, where a superconducting material occupying a region sc is surrounded by a normal metal. The entire configuration occupies a region , which is in turn surrounded by vacuum.

Reference-contexts: At the interface, we impose the boundary condition J s n = 0 on @ sc : (1:7) Strictly speaking, this condition is correct only for superconductor-insulator interfaces and needs to be generalized for superconductor-metal interfaces <ref> [6, Section 7-3] </ref>. However, we have implemented (1.7) everywhere on @ sc . On the outer surface, we may prescribe a surface current K to account for an applied magnetic field H in the exterior vacuum.

Reference-contexts: The diffusion coefficient depends locally on the auxiliary vector U. 4 The variables (2.7) are related to the link variables of lattice gauge theory [15,16]; see the remark following (2.32). Their introduction at this point facilitates the preservation of gauge invariance under discretization <ref> [17] </ref>. Borrowing the terminology, we refer to the vector U as the vector of link variables.

Reference-contexts: This phenomenon has also been observed in magneto-optical experiments and can be explained by electrodynamic considerations. The simulations provide insight into the effect of twin boundaries on the transport properties of superconducting materials. Measurements of Kwok et al. taken at Argonne <ref> [20] </ref> show a sharp drop in the angular dependence of the resistivity in the thermally assisted flux flow (TAFF) regime when the magnetic field is aligned with the twin boundaries.

Reference-contexts: These observations suggest that vortex motion along twin boundaries is suppressed and that twin boundaries enhance vortex pinning, even in the case where vortices move along the twins. On the other hand, magneto-optical data on flux penetration gathered by researchers at AT&T <ref> [21] </ref> show a higher concentration of the magnetic field near twin boundaries. These observations suggest that twin boundaries actually enhance flux penetration. In this scenario, twin boundaries act as channels for "easy vortex motion," and vortex pinning is reduced along twin boundaries.

Reference-contexts: These observations suggest that twin boundaries actually enhance flux penetration. In this scenario, twin boundaries act as channels for "easy vortex motion," and vortex pinning is reduced along twin boundaries. More recent magneto-optical experiments at Argonne <ref> [22] </ref> hint at an even more complicated picture including shadow effects, where the vortex concentration is enhanced on one side of a twin boundary and reduced on the other.

Reference-contexts: More recent magneto-optical experiments at Argonne [22] hint at an even more complicated picture including shadow effects, where the vortex concentration is enhanced on one side of a twin boundary and reduced on the other. The experimental situation has been clarified recently by Welp et al. <ref> [23] </ref>, who showed that the two types of behavior occur in different limits, when the direction of vortex motion is parallel or perpendicular to the twin-boundary plane. Our simulations reveal a rather complicated picture of vortex motion and support aspects of all the above observations.

Reference-contexts: Magnetic flux vortices of opposite polarity attract and annihilate each other, so when the direction of the applied field is reversed, vortices of opposite polarity enter the sample and annihilate existing vortices. Experiments indicate an irregular interface between the regions of opposite polarity <ref> [24] </ref>. Simulations show that the TDGL model captures the roughness and irregularity of the interface; see Section 4.2. A third numerical simulation concerned pattern formation and the spawning of vortices as a magnetic field penetrates into a superconducting sample. <p> Magnetic flux vortices of opposite polarity attract and annihilate each other, so when the direction of the applied field is reversed, vortices of opposite polarity enter the sample and annihilate existing vortices. Experiments indicate an irregular interface between the regions of opposite polarity <ref> [24] </ref>. The roughness is caused by a thermodynamic instability; since the domain interface has negative surface energy, it is unstable. As its length increases, the interface tends to break up and spawn regions of one polarity enclosed by regions of the opposite polarity.

Reference-contexts: Finally, in Section 4.4, we present some results of long-time simulations to show that the symmetry of an intermediate metastable state can differ from the symmetry of the thermodynamical equilibrium state.

Reference-contexts: It is based on the distributed-memory programming model and uses the BlockComm library (part of PETSc <ref> [26] </ref> ) to handle the decomposition of the unknowns across the parallel computer and the communication between the processes. The BlockComm library provides support for the computational stencil described in Section 3. The Chameleon library [27] is used to provide both the portable message-passing interface and the scalable parallel I/O.
