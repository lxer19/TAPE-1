Abstract: Due to the aperture problem, local motion between two images can be precisely computed only at corners while at other points only partial information is available. Therefore the motion is often represented as a 2-D Gaussian random variable. The motivation for using this representation is that the Kalman filter and other methods can easily be used. However, as we show in this paper, the Gaussian approximation is valid only in special cases and often causes severe loss of data. As an alternative, we introduce a method to extract and represent displacement as a probability distribution matrix, and introduce a filter and other tools that works directly on these matrices. Using these tools, we implement a 2-D real-time tracking system. A more detailed version of this paper can be found in [5].

Reference-contexts: In [8] a Gaussian representation and a Kalman filter is used to compute an optical flow map in a video sequence. In [6] [2], Kalman filter is used for obtaining structure from motion. In <ref> [1] </ref> a 3-D tracking system is implemented using spatial and temporal filters. In many cases, this Gaussian assumption is not valid, and leads to errors and information loss. Consider Fig. 1, two points are given and the motion between two frames is to be found.

Reference-contexts: In this section we represent an alternative filter implementation that use the probability matrix P as an input. The technique implemented here can be formalized as a filter which is a generalization of the Kalman filter for any distribution <ref> [4] </ref>. Let the process X be a moving point where the state x t is the point's 2-D velocity vector at time t.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 describes the computation of the object's mean motion directly from the matrices and how to compute each point's motion using this mean motion. Section 5 shows experimental results. A more detailed version of this paper can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. 2 Displacement as a probability distri bution matrix As we have shown, the displacement of a tracked point cannot be represented as a particular single value or as a Gaussian variable. The method we introduce is based on cross-SSD (sum of squared differences). <p> This can cause the tracked points to drift from its initial position after a few frames. In order to prevent drift we need a computation method whose mean computation error over a long sequence of frames is always zero, but can still have instantaneous errors. In <ref> [5] </ref> we show how to achieve such an accuracy using entropy measurements on the point's distribution matrices. 5 Experimental results We have implemented the tracking system described in the above sections. Before the tracking, twenty points were randomly chosen on the tracked object. <p> The tracking works well with live video on a PC in real-time. For comparison, we have tried to repeat the tracking when we approximate the matrices with Gaussians and using the Kalman filter. The results are described in <ref> [5] </ref>. 6 Summary It has been shown that local motion cannot be represented as a Gaussian and that a better approach is to represent it with a distribution matrix. A filter and other tools for manipulating these matrices are derived. A 2-D tracking system was implemented using these tools.

Reference-contexts: The adaptivity can be achieved by giving newer measurement more weight than older ones. An accepted method is to use exponential weighting where a measurement with an age t (t = 1; 2; 3; :::) is given a weight of w (t) = t <ref> [7] </ref> Given the process current probability matrix P x t , This weighting can be implemented as follows. For each element (i; j) in P x t : P 0 and normalize the matrix. determines the filter memory length.
