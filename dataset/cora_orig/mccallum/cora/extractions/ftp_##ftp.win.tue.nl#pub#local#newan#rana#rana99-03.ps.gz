Reference-contexts: In the continuous-time case, so-called generalized observer forms were considered. These generalized observer forms consist of an observable linear system interconnected with a nonlinearity that depends on the output of the system and a finite number of its derivatives. In <ref> [6] </ref>, differential geometric conditions were given under which a continuous-time system may be transformed into a generalized observer form by means of so called generalized coordinate transformations (i.e., transformations that, besides the state of the system, also depend on a finite number of time-derivatives of the outputs) and an output transformation.

Reference-contexts: The proof for the case where only coordinate transformations are considered (or, in other words, the case where p = id IR ) may be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. The case where also output transformations are considered is an (almost) immediate consequence of the case where p = id IR .

Reference-contexts: These conditions came down to the question whether certain functions could be factorized in a certain way. For single-output systems, conditions under which this factorization is indeed possible were given when only output transformations are allowed. (In fact, <ref> [13] </ref> also claims to give conditions for the multi-output case. However, these conditions seem to be incorrect.) One of the purposes of this paper is to 4 2. On existence of extended observers for nonlinear discrete-time systems generalize the conditions given in [13] for single-output systems to the case where, besides <p> when only output transformations are allowed. (In fact, <ref> [13] </ref> also claims to give conditions for the multi-output case. However, these conditions seem to be incorrect.) One of the purposes of this paper is to 4 2. On existence of extended observers for nonlinear discrete-time systems generalize the conditions given in [13] for single-output systems to the case where, besides a coordinate transformation, also an output transformation is allowed. The conditions for the existence of an observer form for continuous-time systems and discrete-time systems given in [10],[11],[1],[12],[13] are quite restrictive. <p> In Section 3, we consider the existence of observer forms for single-output discrete-time systems. The results in this section reformulate and generalize the results in <ref> [13] </ref>. In Section 4, the existence of extended observer forms for single-output discrete-time systems is studied. Section 5 contains some conclusions. 2 Differential forms In this section we give an overview of results from the theory of differential forms that will be used in this paper. <p> This remains a topic for future research. A further topic for future research would be the question when extended observer forms and extended observers for multi-output discrete-time systems exist. As also mentioned in the Introduction, it seems that the conditions given in <ref> [13] </ref> for the existence of an observer form when only coordinate transformations are allowed, seem to be incorrect. Preliminary investigations suggest that in fact the problem of coming up with correct conditions may be quite intractable. On the other hand however, it may 2.

Reference-contexts: Observer design for systems in observer form was first studied, in the continuous-time setting, in [10],[11] (see also <ref> [15] </ref>). In these papers, conditions were given under which a nonlinear continuous-time system may be transformed into a system in observer form by means of a coordinate transformation and an output transformation. Basically, these conditions were given in terms of the integrability of certain codistributions.
