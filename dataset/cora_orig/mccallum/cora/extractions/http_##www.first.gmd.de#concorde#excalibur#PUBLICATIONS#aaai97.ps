Reference-contexts: Real-time Behavior In a dynamic real-time world an agent does not have unlimited time to think about an optimal plan. Some planning systems incorporated this idea, and replaced the deliberative planning by reactive behavior rules, where reasoning is abandoned. The most famous reactive system is PENGI <ref> (Agre & Chapman 1987) </ref>. Also hybrid architectures like PRS (Georgeff & Lansky 1987) were developed. Just as the early planning systems, most of the existing constraint-based systems compute the search for solutions off-line. An approach to eliminate this weakness can be the application of anytime algorithms (Zil-berstein & Russell 1995).

Reference-contexts: Problems include continuous changes, simultaneous actions, and actions or events that last over a period of time. Especially in multi-agent domains with temporally complex actions, the STRIPS-like representations is rather ineligible. An approach to overcome these weak points are interval-based representations. Allen's interval temporal logic was introduced in <ref> (Allen 1983) </ref> and (Allen 1984), and is discussed in detail in (Allen & Fergu-son 1994).

Time intervals are the basic units, which are correlated by relations like BEFORE or OVERLAPS. (Freksa 1992) revises this approach by semi-intervals, where the relations are defined between primitives, which determine the intervals' start and end.

Reference-contexts: The advances in constraint programming suggest its application in planning problems, where planning is treated as a constraint satisfaction problem. Recent remarkable results with Graphplan <ref> (Blum & Furst 1997) </ref> and Satplan (Kautz & Selman 1996) proove the appropriateness of this approach. Required Properties Planning (resp. constraint programming) has to deal with the special properties of dynamic adaptation, real-time behavior and social abilities. The following sections will discuss these matters in more detail.

Reference-contexts: In particular large problems and short time limits result in considerable advantages over classical methods (Wallace & Freuder 1996). An advantage over hybrid architectures is the continuous transition from reaction to deliberation. First steps towards an application of anytime algorithms in planning were made by <ref> (Dean & Boddy 1988) </ref>. In (Kautz & Selman 1992) and (Kautz & Selman 1996) planning is treated as a satisfaction problem and solved by the application of iterative local search techniques.

Reference-contexts: A crucial aspect of an agent is the way its behavior is determined. If there shall be no restriction to reactive actions an underlying planning system is needed. A lot of research has been done on planning, and a wide range of planning systems was developed, like STRIPS <ref> (Fikes & Nilsson 1971) </ref>, UCPOP (Penberthy & Weld 1992), or PRODIGY (Veloso et al. 1995). The advances in constraint programming suggest its application in planning problems, where planning is treated as a constraint satisfaction problem.

Reference-contexts: An example of a first-class application domain of the interval approach is the constraint-based scheduling, see e.g. <ref> (Goltz & John 1996) </ref>. In planning the interval-based time representations is used rarely. The zeno planning system (Penberthy & Weld 1994) is one of few exceptions.
