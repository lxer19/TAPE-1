Title: Possible World Partition Sequences: A Unifying Framework for Uncertain Reasoning  
Author: Choh Man Teng

Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Rochester  
Abstract: When we work with information from multiple sources, the formalism each employs to handle uncertainty may not be uniform. In order to be able to combine these knowledge bases of different formats, we need to first establish a common basis for characterizing and evaluating the different formalisms, and provide a semantics for the combined mechanism. A common framework can provide an infrastructure for building an integrated system, and is essential if we are to understand its behavior. We present a unifying framework based on an ordered partition of possible worlds called partition sequences, which corresponds to our intuitive notion of biasing towards certain possible scenarios when we are uncertain of the actual situation. We show that some of the existing formalisms, namely, default logic, autoepistemic logic, probabilistic conditioning and thresholding (generalized conditioning), and possibility theory can be incorporated into this general framework.

Reference-contexts: The conditioning probability partition sequence is incremental in the sense that we can build a partition sequence conditioned on h 1 ; : : : ; k+1 i based on a partition sequence conditioned on h 1 ; : : : ; k i. It is also persistent <ref> [ Driscoll et al., 1989 ] </ref> since we can retrieve Pr ( j 1 ; : : : ; k ) from a partition sequence conditioned on h 1 ; : : : ; k ; k+1 ; : : :i. Now we turn to thresholding.

Reference-contexts: As a side point, we also showed how the lottery paradox can be avoided by probabilistic thresholding, and how it can be expressed as a threshold probability partition sequence. The semantics we provide is similar in flavor to Shoham's preference semantics <ref> [ Shoham, 1988 ] </ref> . Instead of imposing a preference ordering on models, we impose an ordering on equivalence classes of possible worlds.
