Abstract: The Human Genome Project has been considered "one of the great enterprises of 20th Century Science" [1]. The ultimate goal of many efforts in Molecular Biology, including the Human Genome Project, is to determine the entire sequence of Human DNA and to extract genetic information from it. In this context an important step is to build restriction maps (location of certain identifiable markers) of portions of the DNA [1]. Optical Mapping [2], [8], [9], a process that fixes elongated DNA molecules onto treated surfaces, is a very promising emerging technology for rapid production of ordered restriction maps. Our modeling and solution of detection, mass estimation and extraction of ordered restriction maps of DNA molecules attempts to understand/answer questions of significant importance to Geneticists, Biologists and Chemists. In this paper, we first describe the vision process that identifies the DNA molecules along with the restriction sites, and then model the restriction map problem and describe the algorithm that we use to extract the maps from the data. The input to the vision process is an image of the DNA molecules. We propose a simple Markov chain to model the DNA fragments, and use Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) algorithms to detect and measure the apparent length of the DNA fragments. This is at the heart of the imaging software in use at the laboratory for over two years: the practical implementation continues to undergo various fine tuning processes. In the second part, we model the ordered restriction map as a combinatorial problem which we call the Binary Flip Cut (BFC) problem. We prove hardness results for this and several of its variants and offer a practical solution using techniques from mean field annealing and demonstrate its effectiveness in practice.

A restriction enzyme cleaves or cuts a DNA molecule at some fixed site called the restriction site. An ordered restriction map specifies the location of these identifiable markers or restriction sites along a DNA molecule.

Reference-contexts: uniform distribution on X and Y to obtain P (X; Y j [M ij ]) = P ([M ij ]jX; Y ) : 3.2.1 Statistical Approach: MPM and MAP It is known that from the estimation of Z (see equation (5)) we can obtain average estimates of X and Y <ref> [4] </ref>. These average estimates correspond to the Maximum Posterior Marginal (MPM) estimate of the posterior distribution. Moreover, it is known that in the limit of fi ! 1 the MPM estimate becomes the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate [4]. <p> (see equation (5)) we can obtain average estimates of X and Y <ref> [4] </ref>. These average estimates correspond to the Maximum Posterior Marginal (MPM) estimate of the posterior distribution. Moreover, it is known that in the limit of fi ! 1 the MPM estimate becomes the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate [4]. So we address the two problems, the one of estimating the MPM estimates, X i and Y j , and the MAP estimates. <p> We start with fi = 0 where the solution is clearly X i = Y j = 1=2 + * for all i and j and for some small random value * &gt; 0. We then carry out the process of annealing <ref> [4] </ref>, that is, increment fi and evaluate the new set of ( X) and ( Y ) by iterations over (11) and (12), until a stable point is reached. We then proceed and increment fi and update ( X) and ( Y ) again.
