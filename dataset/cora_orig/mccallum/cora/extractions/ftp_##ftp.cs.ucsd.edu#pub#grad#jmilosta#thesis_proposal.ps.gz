Reference-contexts: Lund et al. then considered several pairs of words categorized as semantically related, associated, or both, from a study by Chiarello et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. If the vectors produced by HAL contain semantic information, they reason, then the vectors should show some analog of priming. For the vectors, priming is defined as the difference between related pair distances and unrelated pair distances.

Reference-contexts: However, these vectors consist of real-valued numbers, and it is more difficult to create attractor points which are not located in the corners of activation space. To this end, it is proposed that the vectors be converted to bipolar representations using the algorithm developed by Clouse & Cottrell <ref> [3] </ref>. Unlike language development, where tracking the order of exposure and salience, etc., is an impossible task, it is conceivable that one could produce a representative data set of the order/frequency with which children learn particular words, at least at the formal education level.

Reference-contexts: They seem to pronounce the words only by way of their meaning.

Reference-contexts: has posited an updated dual-route model called the Dual-Route Cascade (DRC)<ref> [5] </ref> (Figure 3.1). In this model, the lexical route is implemented as an Interactive Activation system, while the non-lexical route is implemented by a set of grapheme-phoneme correspondence (GPC) rules learned from a dataset according to an algorithm described in [5]. Input at the letter identification layer is activated in a left-to-right fashion to simulate the reading direction of English. Activation from both the GPC route and the lexicon route will thus begin to interact at the early phonemes first. <p> The claim is made that words with early phoneme irregularities have longer pronunciation latencies than words with late irregularities, compared to otherwise matched control words <ref> [5] </ref>. Recall from the description of the DRC (Figure 3.1) in Section 2.2 above that consistent feedback within the system will tend to activate phonemes more quickly.

Reference-contexts: In fact, that is one of the requirements for a diagnosis of dyslexia rather than a general learning disability: impaired reading despite average IQ and adequate exposure to materials. In two studies reported in <ref> [6] </ref>, Coltheart & Castles examine whether there are two types of developmental dyslexia, and whether they can be accounted for by the Dual-Route model.

Reference-contexts: Coltheart supports the claims made by the model with the data shown in Table 3.1, based on responses to two-syllable words by normal subjects <ref> [7] </ref>. Coltheart claims that single-route 25 models cannot capture this effect: a response to this challenge will be constructed below. Statistical Neighborhoods & Connectionist Models Single-Route connectionist models are built through exposure to a statistically representative data set related to the phenomena in question. <p> The provided format was not amenable to an automated method for distinguishing the number of syllables in the word. To obtain syllable counts, English two-syllable words were gathered from the Medical Research Council (MRC) Psycholinguistic Database <ref> [7] </ref>, which is conveniently annotated. From these, only those with Kucera-Francis written frequency of one or greater were selected. <p> Although there are several common measures, no definitive standard seems to exist. Thus, several possibilities are explored. Taraban & McClelland (T&M) neighborhoods are defined as words containing the same vowel grouping and final consonant cluster. The neighborhood definition given by Colt-heart <ref> [7] </ref> are words which differ by one letter, taking string position into account. Finally, edit-distance-1 (ED1) neighborhoods are those words which can be generated from the target word by making one change: either a letter substitution, insertion or deletion. <p> Results: Single Syllable Words Network Results First, Coltheart's challenge that a single-route model cannot produce the latency effects was explored. The single-syllable network described above was tested on the collection of single-syllable words identified as irregular by Taraban and McClelland [39]. In <ref> [7] </ref>, control words are selected based on equal number of letters, same beginning phoneme, and Kucera-Francis frequency between 1 and 20 (why frequencies were not matched to the test words is not clear). <p> The neighborhoods for the two-syllable data set were thus examined. Coltheart's 1-letter-different neighborhood criterion is not very informative in this case, since by this criterion most of the target words provided in <ref> [7] </ref> are loners (i.e., have no neighbors). However, using a neighborhood defined by edit-distance of 1 (ED1) again seems to recreate the desired ranking (Table 3.7) as indicated by the ratio of helping pronunciations to the total of the helping and hindering pronunciations.

Reference-contexts: In general, these models did not provide for nonword pronunciation, although some were quite elaborate in accounting for effects such as eye movement and interactions between long-term memory and the internal "programs" for reading. Early dual-route models (e.g., Coltheart <ref> [8] </ref>) account for the ability to pronounce nonwords by positing two procedures for pronunciation (Figure 2.2). As in the first models, this system provides a lexicon for words, and a set of explicit rules to apply when the word is not 5 known.

Reference-contexts: Unlike the orthography-to-phonology mapping, the mapping from word meaning to its pronunciation is arbitrary. That is, "book" sounds like "hook", yet the semantics are dissimilar. Similarly, "hit", "strike", and "slap" are all similar in meaning, yet the pronunciations are not alike. In <ref> [9] </ref>, Cottrell and Plunkett investigate the meaning-to-sounds mapping. Their domain of investigation is, once again, the familiar acquisition of the past tense of verbs. <p> particularly easy, or the vectors can be created by randomly generated prototypes, where a main pattern is associated with an (arbitrary) "central" concept, and variations of this vector created through random perturbations of varying magnitudes can then be created to simulate related concepts of varying similarity to the prototype (e.g., <ref> [9] </ref>, [28]). The problem with the randomly generated vectors is that they don't particularly correspond to anything in the real world, and thus results are less readily interpreted as pertaining to a specific hypothesis of human cognition (as opposed to a more general model). <p> The work of Plaut et al. (1994) is to be extended by modeling the meaning-to-sounds path in conjunction with the orthography-to-phonology path (orthographic pathway) developed in their work. This will be accomplished by combining a network based on the ideas presented in Cottrell & Plunkett <ref> [9] </ref> with the network studied by Plaut et al., and additionally with the network described by Harm & Seidenberg.

Reference-contexts: This network, an approximation to an actual recurrent attractor network, can be seen to perform associative mapping of the patterns, as described in Cottrell, Munro & Zipser <ref> [10] </ref>. Results As a first step, a feed-forward network identical to that used by Plaut et al. was trained using the square root compressed frequency of presentation for the training set.

Reference-contexts: Obviously, with a standard adult vocabulary of 30,000 words, there is insufficient time to search the entire list. Forster <ref> [12] </ref> suggests that the lexicon is represented as a series of "bins," each containing a small number of the words in the vocabulary, with the specific bin to search selected by a hashing scheme or some other narrowing-down competition.

Reference-contexts: interactions between each; the exact nature of these entities and the relations therein differ among the various hypothesized systems and each will be covered in turn. 2.2 Reading by Mature Normal Sub jects Perhaps the most modular proposal of word recognition can be found in early box-and-arrow models (e.g., Goodman <ref> [14] </ref>, Gough [15]). In these models, visual input selects a word from a dictionary-like lexicon; from the information found there pronunciation is produced. These early sequential systems did not usually provide any explanation for how words were selected or precisely what information a lexicon entry contained.

Reference-contexts: Based on these findings, Harm & Seidenberg explore whether these two types of impairment can be achieved in a single-route model <ref> [16] </ref>. Rather than impairment to separate mechanisms as the Dual-Route model would suggest, Harm & Seidenberg propose that the two prominent subtypes of developmental dyslexia might be explained by two different types of damage to a single mechanism. <p> This value, correlated to naming latency, should arise due to the attractor surface the better the child speaks, the better the attractor surface and the shorter the time to convergence. The first step will be replication of the results obtained by Harm & Seidenberg <ref> [16] </ref>, for both normal and impaired network development. For this effort, their data set and phonological representation will be obtained. Once this work has been replicated, the effects of Phonics training on the results and generalization of the network will be examined as in the feedforward experiments of Experiment #1.

Impaired Spelling and Writing In a series of papers concerning connectionist modeling of normal and impaired reading phenomena ([28], <ref> [17] </ref>, [29], [31]), Plaut and colleagues have explored the dynamics of attractor basins in recurrent connectionist networks. <p> An option often adopted to remedy the inability to blend concepts is to construct meaning vectors from particular features rather than full concepts. With these hand-coded vectors, features of concepts are assigned slots in the input/output vectors, such as "lives-outdoors" and "bigger-than-breadbox" <ref> [17] </ref>. This allows concepts which are (intuitively) similar to share similar representations. However, it is often quite laborious (the features must be identified by hand, and then all vectors must be coded by hand).

Reference-contexts: Continuing with the idea of taking semantic representations from empirical data, Lund, Burgess and Atchley <ref> [19] </ref> make the assumption that a representation of word semantics can be found in the usage patterns of very large corpora. To this end, they collected 100 million words from Usenet newsgroups; no attempt was made to control for topic or grammaticality. <p> This simulator is crbp (Continuous Recurrent Back Prop), a discrete-time approximation of a network using continuously activated processing elements. Additionally, semantic vectors for 2685 of the 2998 words in the data set were obtained from Burgess and Lund <ref> [19] </ref>. The remaining words did not appear in Burgess and Lund's corpus. The results of two simulations from Plaut et al. [31] were then duplicated. Using the feed-forward version of the network shown in Figure 2.5, the system was trained on the corpus of 2998 monosyllable English words.

Reference-contexts: The Logogen model accounted for quite 6 a number of word reading phenomena, and held popularity for many years. In 1981, McClelland & Rumelhart proposed the Interactive Activation model of word recognition <ref> [20] </ref>. Much like the Logogen model, the units in this model are activated through accumulated evidence, but frequency effects are explained through resting activation levels (more frequent words had a higher default activation).

Reference-contexts: Here several strategies used by connectionist modelers are reviewed. In early parallel distributed processing models, localist features were often used. That is, each "meaning" was ascribed to a single slot or node in the semantics representation <ref> [21] </ref>. For instance, the concept for "refrigerator" in its entirety might be assigned one node/slot. This procedure has the advantage in that one can determine whether a "concept" is either on or off (less difficulty interpreting the output) but it does not allow concepts which share features to blend together.

Reference-contexts: However, as mentioned above, more realistic feature vectors, in addition to being labor-intensive, suffer from the individual prejudices and preconceptions of the particular researcher who actually develops the vectors. These drawbacks are being addressed through the development of feature norms through subject studies (e.g., <ref> [22] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Although this solves the search time problem, it still does not account for the phenomenon mentioned above, that of the effect of exceptional neighbors on an otherwise regular word. Morton's Logogen model <ref> [24] </ref> was an early system which attempted to explain how the "lexicon" might be structured.

Reference-contexts: There were high-fives all around. This result sparked much criticism, especially from the camps which declared that language could not be modeled by a connectionist system ([11], <ref> [25] </ref>). These critics claimed that the U-shaped learning curve actually displayed by children is not as dramatic as that shown by the Rumelhart & McClelland model. At no time do children completely lose the ability to correctly form the irregular past tense forms that they know.

Reference-contexts: easy, or the vectors can be created by randomly generated prototypes, where a main pattern is associated with an (arbitrary) "central" concept, and variations of this vector created through random perturbations of varying magnitudes can then be created to simulate related concepts of varying similarity to the prototype (e.g., [9], <ref> [28] </ref>). The problem with the randomly generated vectors is that they don't particularly correspond to anything in the real world, and thus results are less readily interpreted as pertaining to a specific hypothesis of human cognition (as opposed to a more general model).

Reference-contexts: However, modeling the effects of semantic knowledge by a single number based on word frequency is a gross oversimplification. Focusing on what is often considered the flip side of surface dyslexia, Plaut and Shal-lice <ref> [29] </ref> attempt to account for a number of phenomena associated with deep dyslexia. So-called deep dyslexics appear to lose the orthography-to-phonology direct mapping, and thus lose the ability to pronounce words by sounding out the print. They seem to pronounce the words only by way of their meaning. <p> Concrete over Abstract 6. Content over Function 7. Inability to read Non-words 8.

Reference-contexts: The network results modeled both naming latency and accuracy, and displayed frequency and consistency interactions similar to that of human subjects. However, one aspect in which the system performed poorly is that pronunciation of nonwords is less accurate than that of normal skilled readers. Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg & Patterson <ref> [31] </ref> address some of the inadequacies of the Seidenberg & McClelland [36] work, still limiting their exploration to the orthography-to-phonology mapping of the linguistic model shown in Figure 2.1. <p> Correspondingly, surface dyslexia is the functioning of the GPC rules in isolation which explains the retained ability to pronounce regular nonwords with the loss of correct pronunciation of even those exception words which were formerly familiar. Plaut et al. <ref> [31] </ref> also address the phenomena characteristic of acquired surface dyslexia after brain injury. Starting with a functioning network as described in the previous section, they lesion the net by removing various connections. However, the results obtained upon testing do not correspond very well to the errors produced by human subjects. <p> Concrete over Abstract 6. Content over Function 7. Inability to read Non-words 8.

Impaired Spelling and Writing In a series of papers concerning connectionist modeling of normal and impaired reading phenomena ([28], [17], [29], <ref> [31] </ref>), Plaut and colleagues have explored the dynamics of attractor basins in recurrent connectionist networks. <p> systems can tell us, there will be some effects which will not emerge without a semantics data set based on (real) words. 22 Chapter 3 Current Work The sections of this chapter document some of the work performed to extend the results covered in Chapter 2, particularly that of [36], <ref> [31] </ref>, and [29]. 3.1 The Choice of Connectionism * Q: Is light a particle or wave? * A: The best description is the one which makes the particular question under consid eration most coherent. * Q: But is it a particle or wave? * A: It's a wavicle, now go away <p> The data set used by Plaut et al. in <ref> [31] </ref> was obtained from Plaut, in addition to the simulator used for some of those experiments. This simulator is crbp (Continuous Recurrent Back Prop), a discrete-time approximation of a network using continuously activated processing elements. <p> Additionally, semantic vectors for 2685 of the 2998 words in the data set were obtained from Burgess and Lund [19]. The remaining words did not appear in Burgess and Lund's corpus. The results of two simulations from Plaut et al. <ref> [31] </ref> were then duplicated. Using the feed-forward version of the network shown in Figure 2.5, the system was trained on the corpus of 2998 monosyllable English words. In the first simulation, the data were presented to the network with a log-compressed frequency, corresponding to Simulation 1 of [31]. <p> Plaut et al. <ref> [31] </ref> were then duplicated. Using the feed-forward version of the network shown in Figure 2.5, the system was trained on the corpus of 2998 monosyllable English words. In the first simulation, the data were presented to the network with a log-compressed frequency, corresponding to Simulation 1 of [31]. The network achieved 2975/2998 in the training set at 350 training epochs, or 99.2% correct. The paper reports 100% correct, although personal communication with Plaut indicates many of his simulations produced only 99% correct. <p> Making the same adjustments, Plaut reported 85.0% while subjects performed at 88.6%. Thus, the simulations performed here for the log-frequency data are consistent with the results obtained by Plaut. Additionally, Part of Simulation 2 from <ref> [31] </ref> was performed, by training a network using data with the square root of the actual data frequencies. Training for 700 epochs, the network achieved 99.2% correct on the training set and 97.7%, 97.7%, and 88.3% correct on the corresponding nonword tests. <p> From these, only those with Kucera-Francis written frequency of one or greater were selected. Single-syllable words with the same frequency criterion were also selected for comparison with previous work. 3284 unique single-syllable words were obtained, in contrast to 2998 words used in Plaut et al. <ref> [31] </ref>. After removing duplicate words from the two-syllable set, all words with pronunciations in the electronic CMU dictionary were used to form input and output vectors. This produces 27 Table 3.2: DRC Latency vs. <p> Each word was then converted into an orthography vector, equivalent to two Plaut et al. <ref> [31] </ref> inputs side-by-side through a conversion program created for this project. Correspondingly, phonology was converted into two Plaut et al. phonology vectors side-by-side. Additionally, some data search engines were created which collect word neighborhoods based on varying criterion described in the following section. <p> This extra input parallels that used by Plaut et al. <ref> [31] </ref> in Simulation 4 and will be increased in activation according to the schedule used in that simulation. The intuition for this extra activation is that initially, the "picture book" method of reading is used, or a teacher is present.

Reference-contexts: The work done in (and controversy surrounding) connectionist modeling of spoken past tense acquisition is one 15 case in point, and will be briefly reviewed here. Early connectionist work done in past tense acquisition had much initial promise. Rumel-hart & McClelland <ref> [34] </ref> performed simulations mapping from the phonology of a verb to phonology of the past tense of the verb. <p> At most, a small handful at a time will be over-regularized, with the effect coming and going over the course of time for different words. This is termed micro-U-shaped learning. Further, they claim that the U-shaped learning curve seen by Rumelhart & McClelland was artificially induced. The simulations in <ref> [34] </ref> radically changed the data set during training. For the first few training epochs, the data set consisted of only the highest frequency verbs, which in English happen to be mostly irregular.

Reference-contexts: In addition to general developmental patterns, the variations between readers of various skill levels will be explored. Sei-denberg <ref> [35] </ref> found that mature readers can be separated into fast, medium and slow readers based on reading speed. Much as seen in development, the faster readers' performance on low frequency words was similar to the slower readers' performance on high frequency words.

Reference-contexts: The volley has gone back and forth between the two camps, with refutations and counter-refutations. In contrast to the claims of the Dual-Route modelers, Seidenberg & McClelland <ref> [36] </ref> provide evidence that the task, with accompanying phenomena, can be learned through a single mechanism. <p> The simulations reported in <ref> [36] </ref> perform rather well, contrary to the claims of the dual-route advocates. The network results modeled both naming latency and accuracy, and displayed frequency and consistency interactions similar to that of human subjects. <p> However, one aspect in which the system performed poorly is that pronunciation of nonwords is less accurate than that of normal skilled readers. Plaut, McClelland, Seidenberg & Patterson [31] address some of the inadequacies of the Seidenberg & McClelland <ref> [36] </ref> work, still limiting their exploration to the orthography-to-phonology mapping of the linguistic model shown in Figure 2.1. <p> Consequently, Plaut et al. develop vector representations for both graphemes and phonemes which they claim more adequately capture these regularities. They develop a recurrent network which duplicates the naming latencies appropriate to their data set, consisting of approximately 3000 one-syllable English words (all the words from <ref> [36] </ref> plus some additional not used in that study). Naming la 10 tencies are computed based on time-to-settle for the recurrent network, and based on MSE for a feed-forward model used in some simulations. <p> Thus, their simulations show that a system can learn rule-like behavior through exposure to the systematic data, even without explicit instruction. The work of Seidenberg & McClelland <ref> [36] </ref> reviewed above also considers developmental issues, although it was not the paper's main focus. As mentioned, the simulations reported performed rather well. The network results modeled both naming latency and accuracy, and displayed frequency and consistency interactions similar to that of human subjects. <p> Even considering these limitations the models presents some interesting effects. 17 In the next section we consider their account of developmental dyslexia. 2.5 Developmental Dyslexias In stark contrast to the modeling of adult normal and damaged processes, very few have addressed developmental dyslexias through modeling. Seidenberg & McClelland <ref> [36] </ref> briefly investigate a possible explanation for developmental dyslexia by limiting the number of hidden nodes in their network to 100 rather than 200. The model then does produce effects found in developmental dyslexia. <p> The network used in these simulations is similar to that used in Seidenberg & McClelland <ref> [36] </ref>, with the addition of cleanup units at the phonological output layer (Figure 2.7). <p> simplified systems can tell us, there will be some effects which will not emerge without a semantics data set based on (real) words. 22 Chapter 3 Current Work The sections of this chapter document some of the work performed to extend the results covered in Chapter 2, particularly that of <ref> [36] </ref>, [31], and [29]. 3.1 The Choice of Connectionism * Q: Is light a particle or wave? * A: The best description is the one which makes the particular question under consid eration most coherent. * Q: But is it a particle or wave? * A: It's a wavicle, now go

Reference-contexts: Results: Single Syllable Words Network Results First, Coltheart's challenge that a single-route model cannot produce the latency effects was explored. The single-syllable network described above was tested on the collection of single-syllable words identified as irregular by Taraban and McClelland <ref> [39] </ref>. In [7], control words are selected based on equal number of letters, same beginning phoneme, and Kucera-Francis frequency between 1 and 20 (why frequencies were not matched to the test words is not clear). <p> Selection of different control words, although certainly varying the precise numbers obtained, did not result in more robust results. Using the control words developed by Taraban and McClelland <ref> [39] </ref> for use with these irregular words in subject studies did not consis 29 Table 3.4: Average Taraban & McClelland Neighborhoods Same Pronunciation Most Frequent Enemies Other Enemies Ratio Position 1 0 17 0 0 Position 2 0.54 8.17 0.4 0.06 Position 3 1.33 7.33 0.167 0.15 Table 3.5: Average Coltheart <p> In the following tables the column Ratio represents the value of (same pronunciation) / (same + different). T&M neighborhood numbers (words containing the same vowel grouping and final consonant cluster) used in Table 3.4 are found in <ref> [39] </ref>. The results using neighborhoods as defined in Taraban & McClelland clearly show the desired rank ordering of effect. First-position-irregularity words have more "enemies" and fewer "friends" than third-position-irregularity words, with the second-position words falling in the middle as desired.

Reference-contexts: The same type of argument can be applied for the genesis of semantic errors. In addition to producing visual, semantic, and visual-then-semantic errors, this model, when damaged in particular ways, also demonstrates the counterintuitive abstract word advantage occasionally observed in some patients <ref> [40] </ref>.
