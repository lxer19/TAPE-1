Reference-contexts: 2 nd jet bundle of IR m , is a "two-tiered" vector bundle: every q is a base point for a fiber of points ( _q; q) 2 IR m fi IR m , and every (q; _q) is a base point for the fiber of q 2 IR m <ref> [4] </ref>. 7 B, for i = 1; : : : ; k. These forces give rise to a net generalized force, w, in B's c-space.

Reference-contexts: Then we shall see that the mobility of an object in an essential equilibrium grasp can almost always be determined from its 1 st and 2 nd order indices. The first work where second-order effects appear is by Asada et. al <ref> [5] </ref>, where planar objects are grasped with 3 elastic rods. Second order considerations have recently appeared in other contexts. For example, [17] develops a second-order analysis of the roll-slide motions of two bodies in contact.

Reference-contexts: Physically, this means that all instantaneous motions at q 0 give rise to local c-space motions that cause the object to penetrate the fingers. Thus, 2 nd order immobility is sufficient to guarantee complete immobility. Czyzowicz et. al. <ref> [6] </ref> have shown that n + 1 frictionless contact points suffice to completely immobilize almost any n-dimensional polygonal shape.

Reference-contexts: For example, Ohwovoriole and Roth [12] describe the relative motions of bodies in contact in terms of Screw Theory, which is a first-order theory.

However, first-order theories are often inadequate in practice. <p> Thus, 4 contact points suffice for 2D grasps and 7 for 3D grasps <ref> [7, 13, 19] </ref>. Moreover, m + 1 is the smallest possible number when only the point-contact aspect of the fingers is considered. However, our 2 nd order mobility theory suggests that objects can be immobilized with less than m + 1 frictionless fingers if curvature effects are taken into account.

This mobility analysis is based on the concept of the free motions of B. Let B be held by k stationary and frictionless fingers A 1 ; : : : ; A k in an equilibrium grasp. <p> The first-order properties of these curves can be equated to other well known first-order theories such as Screw Theory <ref> [16] </ref>. We cast these notions in the configuration-space framework, as this new interpretation is the basis for the novel consideration of second and higher order aspects of mobility. <p> Second, it can be shown that krd i (q 0 )k = 1 for the Euclidean distance [1][p. 66]. It can also be verified that rd i (q 0 ) is equal to the outward pointing unit normal b n i (q 0 ) <ref> [16] </ref>. Thus we get (d i ffi ff)(t) = (^n i (q 0 ) _q)t + O (t 2 ): (2) (A formula for ^n i (q 0 ) is provided by Theorem 1 below.) The following definition characterizes the free-motion curves in terms of their tangents. <p> The first is their coordinate invariance. Given two parametrizations of the same c-space, q and q, let q 0 be the parametrization of q 0 in the q coordinates, and let () denote objects in the q coordinates. Then it can be shown that <ref> [16] </ref>: _q 2 M 1 q 0 Coordinate invariance is an important property in the development of our theory. The structures we define, such as M 1 q 0 (CA i ), involve an inner product, which is not necessarily preserved by coordinate transformations [2]. <p> An expression for the curvature form in terms of the object and finger geometries at the contact points was derived in <ref> [16] </ref>. This expression is repeated in the appendix for the reader's convenience. It is clear from (3) that the free-motion curves are determined to second-order by their velocity and acceleration at q 0 . <p> Our definition of 2 nd order free motions focuses on those curves that are 1 st order roll-slide motions, but might not correspond to free-motion curves. The 2 nd order free motions possess the following two important properties (which are proved in <ref> [16] </ref>). First, they are coordinate invariant. Given two parametrizations of the same c-space, q and q (as mentioned above): ( _q; q) 2 M 2 q 0 Second, the 2 nd order free motions admit the following geometrical interpretation. <p> It can be shown that this notion is independent of the specific metric used to represent the action of ~w on _q in the form w _q, and is thus coordinate invariant <ref> [16] </ref>. We are interested in determining the mobility of B when it is held in a k-fingered equilibrium grasp. Since the net wrench acting on B at an equilibrium grasp must be zero, we get from Theorem 1 the following c-space geometrical characterization of an equilibrium grasp: Corollary 4.1 ([16]) Let <p> (q 0 ); ; ^n k (q 0 ), 0 = 1 ^n 1 (q 0 ) + + k ^n k (q 0 ); (8) for some scalars 1 ; :::; k such that i 0 and P k 5 The Mobility Index of k-Fingered Grasps A mobility index <ref> [16] </ref> is an integer-valued function that measures the mobility, or effective number of degrees of freedom, of B when it is held in an equilibrium-grasp configuration. In this section we derive 1 st and 2 nd order mobility indices based on the 1 st and 2 nd order free motions. <p> This new result is a natural extension of the mobility index introduced in <ref> [16] </ref> for two fingers. At the equilibrium configuration q 0 , the c-obstacle boundaries intersect each other, q 0 2 i=1 S i , and the 1 st order free motions of B are M 1 q 0 = i=1 T q 0 S i . <p> In both cases M 1 q 0 is a one-dimensional subspace, so that 0 m 2 q 0 1. A graphical technique introduced in <ref> [16] </ref>, or direct computation of the relative curvature form (using the curvature formula in the appendix), can be used to show that m 2 q 0 = 1 for the maximal 3-finger grasp,while m 2 q 0 = 0 for the minimal grasp. <p> Richard Murray for his comments during numerous technical discussions. A Appendix: The C-Obstacle Curvature Form This appendix contains expressions for the c-space curvature form, of the boundary S i of a c-obstacle CA i .
