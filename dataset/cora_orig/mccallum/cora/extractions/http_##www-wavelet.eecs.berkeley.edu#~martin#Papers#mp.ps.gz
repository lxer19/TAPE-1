Abstract: The matching pursuit algorithm can be used to derive signal decompositions in terms of the elements of a dictionary of time-frequency atoms. Using a structured overcomplete dictionary yields a signal model that is both parametric and signal-adaptive. In this paper, we apply matching pursuit to the derivation of signal expansions based on damped sinusoids. It is shown that expansions in terms of complex damped sinusoids can be efficiently derived using simple recursive filter banks. We discuss a subspace extension of the pursuit algorithm which provides a framework for deriving real-valued expansions of real signals based on such complex atoms. Furthermore, we consider symmetric and asymmetric two-sided atoms constructed from underlying one-sided damped sinusoids. The primary concern is the application of this approach to the modeling of signals with transient behavior such as music; it is shown that time-frequency atoms based on damped sinusoids are more suitable for representing transients than symmetric Gabor atoms. The resulting atomic models are useful for signal coding and analysis-modification-synthesis.

Reference-contexts: Such basis expansions, however, exhibit serious drawbacks for modeling arbitrary signals; for instance, the Fourier approach provides a poor representation of time-localized signals. To overcome such difficulties, signals can be modeled using overcomplete sets of atoms that exhibit a wide range of time-frequency behaviors <ref> [3] </ref>, [4], [5], [6]. Overcomplete expansions allow for compact representation of arbitrary signals for the sake of compression or analysis [6], [7]. Examples include best basis methods and adaptive wavelet packets. <p> Signal decomposition using more general overcomplete sets has also been considered; approaches include the method of frames [11], basis pursuit [5], FOCUSS [12], and matching pursuit and its variations <ref> [3] </ref>, [4], [13], [14], [15].

In the literature, the time-frequency atoms used in matching pursuit are typically symmetric Gabor atoms [3], [16]. While these are useful for many applications, such symmetric functions are not well-suited for modeling asymmetric events. <p> Methods of the latter type tend to be computationally costly and to lack an effective successive refinement framework [5], [12], so the former category is of more interest here. Specifically, the the matching pursuit algorithm introduced in <ref> [3] </ref> is the method of choice here since it provides a framework for deriving sparse approximate models with successive refinements and since it can be carried out at low cost as will be seen. III. <p> III. Matching Pursuit Matching pursuit is a greedy iterative algorithm for deriving signal decompositions in terms of expansion functions chosen from a dictionary <ref> [3] </ref>, [4]. To achieve compact representation of arbitrary signals, it is necessary that the dictionary elements or atoms exhibit a wide range of time-frequency behaviors and that the appropriate atoms from the dictionary be chosen to decompose a particular signal. <p> After I iterations, the pursuit provides the sparse approximate model x [n] i=1 I X ff i d m (i) [n]: (11) According to Eq. (9), the mean-squared error of such a model approaches zero as the number of iterations increases <ref> [3] </ref>. This convergence implies that I iterations will yield a reasonable I - term model; this model, however, is in general not optimal in the mean-squared sense because of the term-by-term greediness of the algorithm. <p> To enable representation of a wide range of signal features, a large dictionary of time-frequency atoms is used in the matching pursuit algorithm. The computation of the correlations hg; r i i for all g 2 D is thus costly. As noted in <ref> [3] </ref>, this computation can be substantially reduced using an update formula based on Eq. (4); the correlations at stage i + 1 are given by hg; r i+1 i = hg; r i i ff i hg; g i i; (12) where the only new computation required for the correlation update <p> Using such conjugate subspaces yields decompositions of the form x 2 i=1 This approach thus provides real decompositions of real signals using an underlying complex dictionary. A similar notion based on a different computational framework is discussed in <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> Matching pursuit using a large dictionary of such atoms provides a compact, adaptive, parametric time-frequency representation of a signal <ref> [3] </ref>, [4], [6].

Computation Considerations This section compares the computational cost of two matching pursuit implementations: pursuit based on correlation updates <ref> [3] </ref> and pursuit based on recursive filter banks. The cost is measured in terms of memory requirements and multiplicative operations. Simple search operations, table lookups, and conditionals are neglected in the cost measure. Precomputation is allowed without a penalty, but storage of precomputed data is included in the memory cost. <p> It was also demonstrated that the filter bank pursuit method is more efficient with respect to both memory and computation than pursuit based on the update framework of <ref> [3] </ref>. Estimation of the parameters of damped sinusoids in a signal has been widely considered for the applications of system identification and spectral estimation. Such applications, however, usually involve an underlying source-filter model of the signal and thus differ from the task of generalized signal modeling.

In general, compression and denoising can be achieved by deriving a signal expansion and then discarding components with small coefficients; compact expansions are thus well-suited for these applications <ref> [6] </ref>.

A. <p> The shortcoming of basis expansions results from the attempt to represent arbitrary signals using a limited set of functions.

V. Pursuit of Damped Sinusoidal Atoms For dictionaries of complex damped sinusoids, the atomic structure can be exploited to simplify the correlation computation irrespective of the update formula in Eq. (12). It is shown here that the computation can be carried out with simple recursive filter banks and FFTs. <p> At a fixed scale, correlations must be computed at every time-frequency pair in the index set. There are two ways to cover this time-frequency index plane; these correspond to the dual interpretations of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) <ref> [6] </ref>. The first approach is to carry out a running DFT with an exponential window; windowing and the DFT require L and K log K multiplies per time point, respectively, so this method requires roughly N (L + K log K) real multiplies for a signal of length N .

Signal Decompositions In signal processing applications it is often useful to decompose a signal into elementary building blocks. <p> The shortcoming of basis expansions results from the attempt to represent arbitrary signals using a limited set of functions. Better models can be derived by using expansion functions that are signal-adaptive; this can be achieved by using a parametric approach such as the sinusoidal model [6], <ref> [22] </ref>, [23] or by choosing the expansion functions in a signal-dependent fashion from an overcomplete set of time-frequency atoms as in adaptive wavelet packets or matching pursuit [3],[6],[10].

Subspace Pursuit Though searching for the optimal high-dimension subspace is not reasonable, it is worthwhile to consider the related problem of finding an optimal low-dimension subspace at each iteration of the pursuit, especially if the subspaces under consideration have a simplifying structure.

Reference-contexts: Because of the complexity of the search, however, it is not computationally feasible to derive an optimal sparse expansion that perfectly models a signal. It is likewise not feasible to compute approximate sparse expansions that minimize the error for a given sparsity; this is an NP-hard problem <ref> [25] </ref>. For this reason, it is necessary to narrow the considerations to methods that either derive sparse approximate solutions according to suboptimal criteria or derive exact solutions that are not optimally sparse. <p> Computing the optimal I -term estimate using an overcomplete dictionary requires finding the minimum projection error over all I -dimensional dictionary subspaces, which is an NP-hard problem as mentioned earlier <ref> [25] </ref>. To enable representation of a wide range of signal features, a large dictionary of time-frequency atoms is used in the matching pursuit algorithm. The computation of the correlations hg; r i i for all g 2 D is thus costly.

Reference-contexts: The relationship between such overcomplete expansions based on parametric dictionaries and parameter estimation methods such as ESPRIT has yet to be fully considered. Early work, however, suggests that greedy algorithms can be effective for spectral estimation of nonstationary signals <ref> [27] </ref>; greedy parameter estimation seems to be well-suited for scenarios where little or no a priori information about the signal is available.
