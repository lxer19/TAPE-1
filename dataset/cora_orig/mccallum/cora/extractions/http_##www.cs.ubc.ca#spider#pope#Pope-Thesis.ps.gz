Reference-contexts: Also, most reports suggest that TLS is generally less stable than LS. 3 Theoretical analysis indicates that, in general, TLS is more sensitive to outliers <ref> (Ammann and Ness 1989) </ref>, and more sensitive to perturbations in A and b when there is not an exact linear relation between the true but unknown values of A and b (Van Huffel and Vandewalle 1991, p. 5).

Reference-contexts: It seems unlikely, therefore, that any part family could provide com plete and stable descriptions of most objects. 3. Distinguished features A third approach is to describe form only in terms of a limited set of distinguished features. The curvature primal sketch (CPS) is one example of this approach <ref> (Asada and Brady 1986) </ref>. It represents 2-D curves only in terms of the significant changes of curvature|including corners and inflections|that are detected at each scale.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, while they may extend the class of 2.2. Representation Schemes 27 shapes that can be represented well with few features, higher-order curves will still fail to yield stable descriptions of some shapes. Many systems have been demonstrated that use segments or patches as shape features, including hyper <ref> (Ayache and Faugeras 1986) </ref>, which uses polygonal approximations of 2-D curves, and 3d-poly (Chen and Kak 1989), which uses quadric approximations of 3-D surfaces. 2.

Reference-contexts: The search is ordered so that only the smallest region containing any particular LJct is identified. A Region's attributes and position are computed from the region's principal axes of inertia <ref> (Ballard and Brown 1982, p. 255) </ref>. Its location is the region's centroid, its orientation is the direction of the region's major axis, and its scale is the length of that axis; all are considered stable, although the orientation has a two-way ambiguity that must be accommodated during matching.

Reference-contexts: This work does not address the issue of how a database of acquired models should be organized and accessed. It appears likely, however, that model database methods reported elsewhere <ref> (e.g., Beis and Lowe 1994) </ref> can be combined with the recognition and learning methods described here in order to produce a complete recognition system. 1.4 Outline of the Thesis In understanding this work it will be helpful to have some knowledge of object recognition issues and methods; a survey of that <p> Although Oliver does not presently include an indexing method, any of various methods could be adopted for this purpose <ref> (e.g., Beis and Lowe 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Among such estimators, the square root information filter (SRIF) is well suited for this task. Compared to the conventional Kalman filter, for example, the SRIF has better numerical stability and it is more efficient at processing batched measurements <ref> (Bierman 1977) </ref>. As its name implies, the SRIF works by updating the square root of the information matrix, which is the inverse of the estimate's covariance matrix.

Reference-contexts: Kuno, Okamoto, and Okada (1991) have described a similar approach that also considers the likelihood of features arising accidentally, the cost of detecting them, and the degree to which they may be distorted by perspective. Another variation, the local feature focus method <ref> (Bolles and Cain 1982) </ref>, involves analyzing the entire database of object models to select for each model one or more focus features that, due to their specificity, can be used to initiate matching by alignment. There has been some investigation of how to organize the match search hierarchically.

Reference-contexts: Many variations of this basic scheme are possible, and several have been investigated. One might index the table using all features from the image <ref> (Breuel 1990) </ref>, a randomly chosen subset of features (Lamdan, Schwartz, and Wolfson 1988), or just features that are judged particularly likely to have been derived from single objects (Clemens and Jacobs 1991a). One might test 2.3.

Reference-contexts: However, this may be more than compensated for by the fact that testing each model requires only a 2-D/2-D match rather than a 3-D/2-D or 3-D/3-D one, and 2-D/2-D matches can be performed much more quickly <ref> (Breuel 1992b) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Because this system does not learn constraints governing the relative positions of the shape features, it appears to have little ability to distinguish among objects that have different arrangements of similar features. Neural networks, including radial basis function networks, have been used as trainable classifiers for object recognition <ref> (e.g., Brunelli and Poggio 1991) </ref>. In this role, the network approximates a smooth function that maps a vector of feature measurements to an object identifier, or to a vector of graded yes/no responses, one per object. Nearest neighbour classifiers are also commonly used.

Reference-contexts: And although the networks have the advantage that they can be trained using images, there appear to be other trainable classifiers that can perform more quickly and about as accurately <ref> (e.g., the nearest-neighbour classifier described by Brunelli and Poggio 1992) </ref>. Another recently proposed indexing approach organizes the model library hierarchically. Models of similar objects are clustered, and each cluster is represented in the library by a single prototype.

Parts With a limited set of parts one can construct a large variety of objects, especially if each part can be customized somewhat by choosing values for free parameters.

Reference-contexts: It may not be, however. When the solution t is being used to predict new values of b from given values of A, a t obtained by LS is expected to yield more accurate predictions than one obtained by TLS <ref> (Cheng and Hess 1990) </ref>. Informally, this is because LS minimizes the distance At b, which is comparable to the prediction error, whereas TLS minimizes something else (the orthogonal distance between the data [A; b] and the subspace t).

Reference-contexts: To build a multiple-view model analytically, the view sphere is subdivided into regions by identifying boundaries where the object's self-occlusions begin and end. Algorithms exist for performing such analyses on restricted classes of shape, such as solids of revolution <ref> (Eggert and Bowyer 1993) </ref> and algebraic surfaces (Petitjean, Ponce, and Kriegman 1992). The regions correspond to qualitatively distinct appearances of the object, and there may be thousands of them for an object of moderate complexity.

Reference-contexts: In other part/whole hierarchies, levels of the hierarchy represent degrees of grouping, and primitive features occur only at the hierarchy's lowest level <ref> (Ettinger 1987) </ref>. A second method of organizing features, not necessarily incompatible with the first, is to arrange them according to adjacency relations so that each feature is related to others nearby (Connell and Brady 1987; Shapiro 1980; Wong, Lu, and Rioux 1989).

Reference-contexts: For example, Witt's stated goal in forming probabilistic concepts among attribute vectors is to maximize pairwise attribute correlation within clusters and minimize correlation between clusters (Hanson and Bauer 1989); Cobweb's goal is to find concepts for which missing attributes can be readily predicted <ref> (Fisher 1987) </ref>; and Segen's system seeks a clustering that allows the concepts and instances to be represented as concisely as possible (Segen 1990). Our procedure for clustering image graphs should base its decisions on the following two goals, both directly related to recognition performance: 140 CHAPTER 6. <p> Clustering Procedure 149 This new match is found by extending the partial set of feature pairings and the viewpoint transformation suggested by the previous match. Order sensitivity Incremental clustering algorithms are often sensitive to the order in which training examples are presented. Some algorithms <ref> (e.g., Cobweb, Fisher 1987) </ref> attempt to reduce order sensitivity by reassigning examples, splitting clusters, and merging clusters in the course of training. These additional operations greatly increase the clustering algorithm's search space and, consequently, its computational complexity.

Reference-contexts: For these reasons, invariants and quasi-invariants are favoured as indexing features (Mundy, Zisserman, and Forsyth 1994), and poor distributions occur when objects are symmetrical or when they share common features <ref> (Flynn 1992) </ref>. Indexing performance is also greatly affected by uncertainty in feature measurements. Uncertainty may be accommodated by coarsely quantizing feature dimensions, by replicating table entries (with a range of duplicate entries representing a range of possible measurements), or by sampling a range of index values at lookup time.

Reference-contexts: Under the viewpoint consistency constraint and an appropriate error model, the two spaces are closely related: Each set of pairings is consistent with zero or more transformations, and each transformation, with zero or more sets of pairings. 2 The interpretation tree method <ref> (Grimson 1990) </ref> exemplifies those methods that search entirely in correspondence space. Its name refers to a search tree of choices regarding the interpretation of each image feature. <p> One way to avoid considerable computation is to relax the requirement that an optimal match be found and search instead for a near-optimal one.

Reference-contexts: Because there may be many combinations of anchor feature pairings, this method relies heavily on having efficient techniques for computing and verifying transformations <ref> (Huttenlocher 1988) </ref>. The alignment method estimates a transformation once for each set of anchor feature pairings, and an error in localizing an anchor feature in the image yields an error in the transformation estimate. That error perturbs the locations of projected features, contributing to errors in pairing those additional features. <p> Affine transformations model perfectly the apparent deformations of a planar object viewed under orthographic projection <ref> (Huttenlocher 1988) </ref>; for nonplanar objects viewed under perspective projection, they provide an approximation that may be poor. 4.4.

Reference-contexts: Three coplanar, non-collinear points define two vectors, which can be used as a basis for representing the locations of other points lying in the same plane. The resulting representation is invariant to 2-D affine transformations, which can approximate perspective projections as a combination of orthographic projection and scaling <ref> (Lamdan, Schwartz, and Wolfson 1988) </ref>. 2. A pair of coplanar conics yields two projective invariants. These can be used to identify objects like gaskets, which are essentially coplanar and typically composed of circles and ellipses (Forsyth et al. 1991). 3. <p> Many variations of this basic scheme are possible, and several have been investigated. One might index the table using all features from the image (Breuel 1990), a randomly chosen subset of features <ref> (Lamdan, Schwartz, and Wolfson 1988) </ref>, or just features that are judged particularly likely to have been derived from single objects (Clemens and Jacobs 1991a). One might test 2.3. <p> One might test 2.3. Recognition 39 every hypothesis retrieved from the table for a possible match (Clemens and Jacobs 1991a), or instead treat the hypotheses as votes, and only test those that receive the most votes <ref> (Lamdan, Schwartz, and Wolfson 1988) </ref> or some minimum number of votes (Stein and Medioni 1992b). <p> One can estimate the probability that each test will miss an actual occurrence of a modeled object, and repeat testing until the cumulative probability of missing an object drops below any desired threshold <ref> (Lamdan, Schwartz, and Wolfson 1988) </ref>. How well indexing performs depends on how well entries are distributed throughout the table. The entries associated with any single object should occupy a relatively small portion of the entire table, and each entry should refer to relatively few objects.

Reference-contexts: Until recently perhaps, no comparable method has existed for objects that are smooth but otherwise unrestricted, primarily due to the difficulty of predicting the 2-D curves projected by the contours of a smooth object <ref> (Lavallee and Szeliski 1995) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Certain relations between lines in three dimensions, such as cotermination (the proximity of endpoints), parallelism, and collinearity, appear approximately invariant when seen from various viewpoints <ref> (Lowe 1985) </ref>. Even angles between general pairs of lines (not necessarily parallel), and ratios of line lengths, are relatively stable with respect to viewpoint (Ben-Arie 1990; Burns, Weiss, and Riseman 1993). Another technique for improving the space/accuracy trade-off of a multiple-view representation is to interpolate among views.

Whereas conventional clustering methods consider only the separation of instances in some metric space, conceptual clustering also considers concepts induced to represent each group.

Reference-contexts: The entries associated with any single object should occupy a relatively small portion of the entire table, and each entry should refer to relatively few objects. For these reasons, invariants and quasi-invariants are favoured as indexing features <ref> (Mundy, Zisserman, and Forsyth 1994) </ref>, and poor distributions occur when objects are symmetrical or when they share common features (Flynn 1992). Indexing performance is also greatly affected by uncertainty in feature measurements.

Reference-contexts: Practically speaking, even true 2.2. Representation Schemes 25 apparent angle between a pair of lines, as measured in an image, is often close to their true angle in 3-D space. Left: Burns' figure <ref> (reprinted from Burns, Weiss, and Riseman 1993) </ref> depicts a 90 ffi angle viewed under orthographic projection from various 3-D positions. It appears to be within 15 ffi of 90 ffi over approximately 42 percent of the viewsphere. <p> Two-dimensional analogs of the generalized cylinder are ribbons, symmetric axis transforms, and smoothed local symmetries. Generalized cylinders and their two-dimensional counterparts describe only certain elongated shapes well.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a multiple-view representation requires considerably more space than a 3-D one. Space requirements can be reduced somewhat by allowing views to share common structures (Minsky 1975; Burns and Riseman 1992) and by merging similar views after discarding features too fine to be reliably discerned <ref> (Petitjean, Ponce, and Kriegman 1992) </ref>. Another consequence is that there are, in effect, many more models to be considered during recognition as each characteristic view is a separate model. <p> To build a multiple-view model analytically, the view sphere is subdivided into regions by identifying boundaries where the object's self-occlusions begin and end. Algorithms exist for performing such analyses on restricted classes of shape, such as solids of revolution (Eggert and Bowyer 1993) and algebraic surfaces <ref> (Petitjean, Ponce, and Kriegman 1992) </ref>. The regions correspond to qualitatively distinct appearances of the object, and there may be thousands of them for an object of moderate complexity. However, not all of these appearances can be distinguished in images of limited resolution, and some have vanishingly small probabilities of occurring.

Reference-contexts: By encouraging a close fit between model graphs and image graphs, this goal favours detailed models that are likely to discriminate objects effectively. 6.2.3 Minimum description length principle The qualities of simplicity and accuracy can be neatly combined in a single framework provided by Rissanen's minimum description length (MDL) principle <ref> (Rissanen 1978) </ref>, which holds that the best statistical model M for a set of data X is that yielding the shortest description of M and X combined. Similar decision criteria have been independently proposed by Wallace and Boulton (1968) for classification, by Segen (1979) for clustering, and by others.

Reference-contexts: In practical situations, the data X have only finite precision; consequently, the model parameters need only have finite precision too. Real-valued model parameters can be truncated to finite precision while including the truncation length itself as one parameter over which description length is optimized <ref> (Rissanen 1983) </ref>. Alternatively, a truncation length or quantization interval can be predetermined, or real values can be restricted to rational numbers, which can be encoded as pairs of integers.

Reference-contexts: There is an invariant of orthographic projections of four 3-D points that applies only if the four points define three orthogonal vectors. A test can be used to determine which projected sets of points meet this condition so that the invariant is only relied upon where appropriate <ref> (Wayner 1991) </ref>. Another approach is to use properties that, although not truly invariant, are nearly so. Ben-Arie (1990) and Burns, Weiss, and Riseman (1993) have developed probabilistic models that describe how certain image properties, such as junction angles and ratios of distances, vary with viewpoint.
