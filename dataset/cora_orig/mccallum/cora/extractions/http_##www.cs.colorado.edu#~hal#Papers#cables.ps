Title: How to Make a Square Grid Framework with Cables Rigid  
Author: Harold N. Gabow Tibor Jordan 
Date: October 27, 1998  
Abstract: This paper solves the problem of making a bipartite digraph strongly connected by adding the smallest number of new edges that preserve bipartiteness. A result of Baglivo and Graver shows this corresponds to making a 2-dimensional square grid framework with cables rigid by adding the smallest number of new cables. We prove a min-max formula for the smallest number of new edges in the digraph problem, and give a corresponding linear-time algorithm. We generalize these results to the problem of making an arbitrary digraph strongly connected by adding the smallest number of new edges, each of which joins vertices in distinct blocks of a given partition of the vertex set.

Reference-contexts: A potentially cheaper way to make a framework rigid is to use pliable material along the diagonals. A cable can be compressed but not stretched, and can join two diagonally-opposite points of a grid square (see Fig. 2). Baglivo and Graver <ref> [1] </ref> show that a framework with cables has a natural representation as a bipartite digraph, such that the framework is rigid if and only if its bipartite digraph is strongly connected (Fig. 2). <p> Our result corresponds to the k = 1 case of [3]. This case is the problem of augmenting a bipartite graph to make it connected and bipartite. This simple problem has no exceptional families. It is equivalent to the rod-framework rigidity problem, which was solved in <ref> [1] </ref> and [14]. Until now the cable-framework rigidity problem has been left open, perhaps because the phenomenon of exceptional families has been ignored. Section 2 of this paper gives basic facts about our augmentation problem, including lower and upper bounds on the solution size.

Reference-contexts: Other restrictions that have been investigated include the following: Augmenting to achieve k-edge-connectivity while preserving simplicity of the given graph [2],[11]; augmenting while preserving planarity [12], [13]; augmenting an undirected bipartite graph to achieve 2-vertex-connectivity [9] or k-edge-connectivity <ref> [3] </ref> while preserving bipartiteness. Augmenting a biconnected graph to achieve both k-edge connectivity and 3-vertex connectivity is studied in [10]. This paper investigates the problem of making a bipartite digraph strongly connected while preserving bipartiteness. We prove a min-max formula for the smallest possible number of new edges. <p> Because of this relation the results of <ref> [3] </ref> answer questions such as, find a smallest set of new rods whose addition results in a framework that is rigid, even after an arbitrary set of k diagonal rods fail. the framework becomes rigid and the bipartite graph becomes connected. <p> Roughly put, the formula states that the optimum number of new edges either equals a natural lower bound or is one more than that. The latter holds exactly when the graph belongs to one of four infinite families. This result has similar overall structure to the min-max formula of <ref> [3] </ref> for bipartite undirected graph k-edge-connectivity augmentation: Both formulas have an infinite number of exceptional graphs that require one extra edge. The formula of [3] has a single family of exceptional graphs. <p> The latter holds exactly when the graph belongs to one of four infinite families.

The formula of [3] has a single family of exceptional graphs. Our problem, just for the k = 1 case, seems to have more complicated structure, with four distinct families. Together these two results give evidence that min-max formulas with exceptions may be a general phenomenon. <p> Our problem, just for the k = 1 case, seems to have more complicated structure, with four distinct families.

We close by noting that if our operation is not adding new cables but replacing existing cables by rods, the rigidity problem can be solved by the Lucchesi-Younger Theorem [7].

Reference-contexts: These procedures are given in Sections 8.2 - 8.5. We start with two general observations. First recall that the strong component graph of a given digraph can be constructed in linear time, using routines for depth-first search and contraction <ref> [5] </ref>. Next observe that OPT + 1 = O (n) new edges get added to the graph. Hence all graphs we work with contain O (n + m) edges. 8.1 Compatible pairs This section describes several routines to find compatible pairs.
