Abstract: UNIX is a general-purpose, multi-user, interactive operating system for the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11/40 and 11/45 computers. It offers a number of features seldom found even in larger operating systems, including: (1) a hierarchical file system incorporating demountable volumes; (2) compatible file, device, and inter-process I/O; (3) the ability to initiate asynchronous processes; (4) system command language selectable on a per-user basis; and (5) over 100 subsystems including a dozen languages. This paper discusses the nature and implementation of the file system and of the user command interface. Copyright 1974, Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.

Reference-contexts: It is hoped, however, the users of UNIX will find that the most important characteristics of the system are its simplicity, elegance, and ease of use. Besides the system proper, the major programs available under UNIX are: assembler, text editor based on QED <ref> [2] </ref>, linking loader, symbolic debugger, compiler for a language resembling BCPL [3] with types and structures (C), interpreter for a dialect of BASIC, text formatting program, Fortran compiler, Snobol interpreter, top-down compiler-compiler (TMG) [4], bottom-up compiler-compiler (YACC), form letter generator, macro processor (M6) [5], and permuted index program.

There is also a host of maintenance, utility, recreation, and novelty programs.

Reference-contexts: The greater part of UNIX software is written in the above-mentioned C language <ref> [6] </ref>. Early versions of the operating system were written in assembly language, but during the summer of 1973, it was rewritten in C. The size of the new system is about one third greater than the old.

Reference-contexts: Since anyone may set the set-user-ID bit on one of his own files, this mechanism is generally available with out administrative intervention. For example, this protection scheme easily solves the MOO accounting problem posed in <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The fork operation, essentially as we implemented it, was present in the Berkeley time-sharing system [8]. On a number of points we were inuenced by Multics, which suggested the particular form of the I/O system calls <ref> [9] </ref> and both the name of the Shell and its general functions, The notion that the Shell should create a process for each command was also suggested to us by the early design of Mul-tics, although in that system it was later dropped for efficiency reasons.

Statistics The following statistics from UNIX are presented to show the scale of the system and to show how a system of this scale is used. Those of our users not involved in document preparation tend to use the system for program development, especially language work.
