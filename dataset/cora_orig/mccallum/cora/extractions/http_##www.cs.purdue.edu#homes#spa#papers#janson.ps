Abstract: We consider a leader election algorithm in which a set of distributed objects (people, computers, etc.) try to identify one object as their leader. The election process is randomized, that is, at every stage of the algorithm those objects that survived so far flip a biased coin, and those who received, say a tail, survive for the next round. The process continues until only one objects remains. Our interest is in evaluating the limiting distribution and the first two moments of the number of rounds needed to select a leader. We establish precise asymptotics for the first two moments, and show that the asymptotic expression for the duration of the algorithm exhibits some periodic fluctuations and consequently no limiting distribution exists. These results are proved by analytical techniques of the precise analysis of algorithms such as: analytical poissonization and depoissonization, Mellin transform, and complex analysis. fl The work of this author was supported by NSF Grants NCR-9206315 and NCR-9415491, and NATO Collaborative Grant CRG.950060.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Consider a group of n people (users, computers, objects, etc.) sharing a scarce resource (e.g., channel, CPU, etc.). The following elimination process can be used to find a "winner" or a "leader" that has undisputed and uncontested access to the resource (cf. <ref> [2, 5, 19] </ref>): All objects involved toss a biased coin, and all players to throw heads are losers while those who throw tails remain candidate winners and flip the coins again until a single winner (leader) is identified.

Reference-contexts: Actually, during the course of establishing the limiting distribution we realize that its asymptotic expression exhibits some fluctuations leading us to a conclusion that the height does not possess a limiting distribution. This was already observed for the height of tries (cf. <ref> [3] </ref>) and symmetric (unbiased coin tossing) incomplete trie (cf. [5]). The paper is organized as follows. The next section presents our main results: In Theorem 1 we discuss asymptotics of the mean and the variance of the height.

The problem was posed for a fair (unbiased) coin tossing process by Prodinger [19] (cf. also [10]), who provided the first non-trivial analysis. Recently, for the same fair coin model, Fill et. al. <ref> [5] </ref> find the limiting distribution for the number of rounds. In this paper, we analyze the same problem but when the coins involved are biased, that is, the probability p of throwing a head is not equal to one half (p 6= 1 2 ). <p> We also remark that a formula for the exact distribution has been given by Fill et. al. <ref> [5] </ref> for the fair model and by Fill [6] for the biased case. <p> We also remark that a formula for the exact distribution has been given by Fill et. al.

[3]) and symmetric (unbiased coin tossing) incomplete trie (cf. <ref> [5] </ref>). The paper is organized as follows. The next section presents our main results: In Theorem 1 we discuss asymptotics of the mean and the variance of the height. The next Theorem 2 provides an asymptotic expression for the distribution of the height. <p> In particular, we verify that our formula (8) on the variance agrees with that of Fill et al. <ref> [5] </ref> for p = 0:5, where the exact value 1 fl = 0:422 : : : is given. In order to formulate our next result concerning the distribution of H n we need a new definition. <p> We observe that for p = q = 0:5 we obtain F (x) = x j=1 x ; and our results coincide with those of <ref> [5] </ref>. (iii) It is easily seen that lim x!0 F (x) = 1 and lim x!1 F (x) = 0. We conjecture that F (x) is always decreasing, as it is for p = 0:5 by the explicit formula in (ii). <p> In this subsection, we first derive functional equations for the Poisson model, and then present a general depoissonization lemma of Jacquet and Szpankowski [15] (cf. also <ref> [5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20] </ref>) that we apply throughout the paper. We now build the Poisson model. <p> Observe that in the symmetric case (i.e., p = q = 0:5) these functional equations reduce to the one analyzed in Szpankowski [22] (cf. also <ref> [5, 7, 16] </ref>). We solve these functional equations asymptotically (see the next two subsections) for z large and real.

Reference-contexts: We also remark that a formula for the exact distribution has been given by Fill et. al. [5] for the fair model and by Fill <ref> [6] </ref> for the biased case. The above elimination process can be represented as a incomplete trie (cf. [5, 18, 19]) in which only one side of the trie is developed while the other side is pruned (all those players who throw heads do not participate any more in the process). <p> We further let G 0 (u) = 0 for convenience. (This corresponds to defining H 0 = 1; as pointed out by Jim Fill <ref> [6] </ref>, this convention is reasonable since we never succeed to choose a leader without any candidates.) Then, G 1 (u) = 1 and for n 2 G n (u) = u k=0 n ! The first term of the above is a consequence of the Bernoulli-like split (after the first round)

Reference-contexts: The point to observe is that there is a coefficient depending on z in front of f (qz) which makes the problem interesting (otherwise a standard approach can be applied; cf. <ref> [7] </ref>). While a first-order asymptotic for a such equations, when z ! 1 in a cone around the positive axis, is rather easy to obtain, second-order asymptotics are more challenging. This demands an evaluation of some constants for which a closed-form solution does not exist. <p> Observe that in the symmetric case (i.e., p = q = 0:5) these functional equations reduce to the one analyzed in Szpankowski [22] (cf. also <ref> [5, 7, 16] </ref>). We solve these functional equations asymptotically (see the next two subsections) for z large and real.

A beautiful survey on Mellin transform can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>, and we refer the reader to this paper for details concerning Mellin transform. The Poisson mean e X (z) and second factorial moment f W (z) satisfy function equations (14) and (15), respectively.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we depoissonize these findings to recover our results for the original model. 3.1 Poissonization and Depoissonization It is well known that often poissonization leads to a simpler solution due to unique properties of the Poisson distribution (cf. <ref> [9] </ref>). Poissonization is a technique which replaces the fixed population model (sometimes called the Bernoulli model) by a model in which the population varies according to the Poisson law (hence, Poisson model).

Reference-contexts: If all players throw heads at any stage, the toss is inconclusive and all players participate again in the contest. How many tosses are needed to identify a winner?

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Consider a group of n people (users, computers, objects, etc.) sharing a scarce resource (e.g., channel, CPU, etc.). The following elimination process can be used to find a "winner" or a "leader" that has undisputed and uncontested access to the resource (cf. <ref> [2, 5, 19] </ref>): All objects involved toss a biased coin, and all players to throw heads are losers while those who throw tails remain candidate winners and flip the coins again until a single winner (leader) is identified. <p> If all players throw heads at any stage, the toss is inconclusive and all players participate again in the contest. How many tosses are needed to identify a winner? The problem was posed for a fair (unbiased) coin tossing process by Prodinger <ref> [19] </ref> (cf. also [10]), who provided the first non-trivial analysis. Recently, for the same fair coin model, Fill et. al. [5] find the limiting distribution for the number of rounds. <p> We also remark that a formula for the exact distribution has been given by Fill et. al. [5] for the fair model and by Fill [6] for the biased case. The above elimination process can be represented as a incomplete trie (cf. <ref> [5, 18, 19] </ref>) in which only one side of the trie is developed while the other side is pruned (all those players who throw heads do not participate any more in the process).

Several new analytical techniques were developed in the process of analyzing different parameters of digital trees (cf. <ref> [4, 5, 10, 13, 14, 16, 20, 21, 22] </ref>). Recently, the focus of the research was moved towards developing analytical techniques that can handle limiting distributions and large deviations results (cf. [5, 11, 12, 14, 15]). <p> In the case of the leader election algorithm, we replace n by a random variable N distributed according to Poisson with mean equal n. We shall apply analytical poissonization (cf. <ref> [10, 11, 13, 14, 20] </ref>) that makes use of the Poisson transform (i.e., exponential generating function as shown below). One must observe, however, that after solving the Poisson model (in most cases we can only solve it asymptotically!), we must depoissonize to recover the Bernoulli model results. <p> In this subsection, we first derive functional equations for the Poisson model, and then present a general depoissonization lemma of Jacquet and Szpankowski [15] (cf. also <ref> [5, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20] </ref>) that we apply throughout the paper. We now build the Poisson model. <p> We solve these functional equations asymptotically (see the next two subsections) for z large and real. The next step is a depois-sonization of these results, and we present now a general depoissonization result of Jacquet and Szpankowski [15] that generalize previous depoissonization lemmas of <ref> [11, 12, 13, 20] </ref>. Recall that a measurable function : (0; 1) ! (0; 1) is slowly varying if (tx)= (x) ! 1 as x ! 1 for every fixed t &gt; 0.

Recently, the focus of the research was moved towards developing analytical techniques that can handle limiting distributions and large deviations results (cf.

Namely, we consider functional equations of 2 the following type: f (z) = f (pz) + f (qz)e pz + a (z) (1) where p + q = 1 and a (z) is a given function. <p> This demands an evaluation of some constants for which a closed-form solution does not exist. We provide a quickly converging numerical procedure to assess these constants. We must mention that functional equations of type (1) could be alternatively treated by the method proposed in [4] (cf. <ref> [21] </ref>), however, it seems to us that our method is more straightforward. In addition, in [4] the problem of evaluating the constants was not discussed.
