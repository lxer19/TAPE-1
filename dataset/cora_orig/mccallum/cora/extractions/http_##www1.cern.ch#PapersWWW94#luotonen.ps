Title: WorldWide Web Proxies  
Author: Ari Luotonen, CERN Kevin Altis, Intel 
Date: April 1994  
Note: 1 of 8  1.0 Introduction Current proxy methodology is based on the earlier gateway code written by Tim Berners-Lee as part of libwww, the WWW Common Library [LIBWWW]. Kevin Altis,  
Abstract: A WWW proxy server, proxy for short, provides access to the Web for people on closed subnets who can only access the Internet through a firewall machine. The hypertext server developed at CERN, cern_httpd, is capable of running as a proxy, providing seamless external access to HTTP, Gopher, WAIS and FTP. cern_httpd has had gateway features for a long time, but only this spring they were extended to support all the methods in the HTTP protocol used by WWW clients. Clients dont lose any functionality by going through a proxy, except special processing they may have done for nonnative Web protocols such as Gopher and FTP. A brand new feature is caching performed by the proxy, resulting in shorter response times after the first document fetch. This makes proxies useful even to the people who do have full Internet access and dont really need the proxy just to get out of their local subnet. This paper gives an overview of proxies and reports their current status. The primary use of proxies is to allow access to the Web from within a firewall (Fig. 1). A proxy is a special HTTP [HTTP] server that typically runs on a firewall machine. The proxy waits for a request from inside the firewall, forwards the request to the remote server outside the firewall, reads the response and then sends it back to the client. In the usual case, the same proxy is used by all the clients within a given subnet. This makes it possible for the proxy to do efficient caching of documents that are requested by a number of clients. The ability to cache documents also makes proxies attractive to those not inside a firewall. Setting up a proxy server is easy, and the most popular Web client programs already have proxy support built in. So, it is simple to configure an entire work group to use a caching proxy server. This cuts down on network traffic costs since many of the documents are retrieved from a local cache once the initial request has been made.

Reference-contexts: A proxy allows client writers to forget about the tens of thousands of lines of networking code necessary to support every protocol and concentrate on more important client issues its possible to have lightweight clients that only understand HTTP (no native FTP <ref> [FTP] </ref>, Gopher [GOPHER], etc. protocol support) other protocols are transparently handled by the proxy. By using HTTP between the client and proxy, no protocol functionality is lost, since FTP, Gopher, and other Web protocols map well into HTTP methods. Clients without DNS (Domain Name Service) can still use the Web.

Reference-contexts: For example, a Gopher or FTP directory listing is returned as an HTML document. 2.1 Client Side Issues Most WWW clients are built on top of libwww, the WWW Common Library, which handles the different communication protocols used in the Web, namely HTTP, FTP, Gopher, News [NTTP] and WAIS <ref> [WAIS] </ref>. The entire proxy support is handled automatically for clients using the libwww. Environment variables are used to control the library. There is an individual environment variable for each access protocol; e.g. http_proxy, ftp_proxy, gopher_proxy and wais_proxy.

Reference-contexts: The requested path specifies the document or a CGI <ref> [CGI] </ref> script on the local filesystem of the server, or some other resource available from that server. When a client sends a request to a proxy server the situation is slightly different.

Reference-contexts: Technical Details World-Wide Web Proxies 3 of 8 Proxying allows for high level logging of client transactions, including client IP address, date and time, URL <ref> [URL] </ref>, byte count, and success code. Any regular fields and meta-information fields in an HTTP transaction are candidates for logging. This is not possible with logging at the IP or TCP level. It is also possible to do filtering of client transactions at the application protocol level.

Reference-contexts: Some clients also provide additional means of configuring the client to use a proxy server (e.g. Mosaic for X <ref> [MOSAIC-X] </ref> can use X resources and Mosaic for Windows [MOSAIC-WIN] uses settings in its initialization file). The latest (as of April 1994) libwww (version 2.15) also supports an exception list so clients dont have to always go through the proxy.

Reference-contexts: For Web clients, the modifications needed to support application-level proxying are minor (as an example, it took only five minutes to add proxy support for the Emacs Web browser <ref> [EMACS-WWW] </ref>). There is no need to compile special versions of Web clients with firewall libraries, the standard out-of-the-box client can be configured to be a proxy client.
