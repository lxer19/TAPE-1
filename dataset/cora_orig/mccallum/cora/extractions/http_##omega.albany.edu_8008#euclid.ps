Reference-contexts: But according to historians of mathematics: "Euclid's title to immortality is based on something quite other than the supposed logical perfection which is still sometimes erroneously ascribed to him. This is his recognition that the fifth of his postulates (his Axiom XI) is a pure assumption" <ref> (Bell, 1937 p.299) </ref>. The fifth postulate of Euclid asserts that through a point P not on a line l passes exactly one line l 0 parallel to l. This and equivalent statements were the source of a 2,200 year long head ache for mathematics.

Reference-contexts: The history of physics contains many of these coincidences. e.g. non-euclidean geometry made general relativity thinkable and Penrose non periodic tilings allowed to see the quasi-cristals to name only the classic and the recent examples. Some neo platonists <ref> (see Penrose, 1989 for a lucid popular exposition) </ref> feel entitled to revive from here the old metaphysical thesis that physical existence is the shadow of the imaginary platonic world of mathematics. But their real claim, I believe, hides behind their shadows.
