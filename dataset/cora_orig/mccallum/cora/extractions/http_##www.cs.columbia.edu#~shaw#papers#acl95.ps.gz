Title: Conciseness through Aggregation in Text Generation  
Author: James Shaw

Abstract: Aggregating different pieces of similar information is necessary to generate concise and easy to understand reports in technical domains. This paper presents a general algorithm that combines similar messages in order to generate one or more coherent sentences for them. The process is not as trivial as might be expected. Problems en countered are briefly described.

Reference-contexts: While other systems do generate conjunctions, they deal with restricted cases such as conjunction of subjects and predicates <ref> (Dalianis&Hovy93) </ref>. There are other interesting problems in aggregations. Generating marker words to indicate relationships in conjoined structures, such as "respectively", is another short term goal.
