Abstract: With the move to self-directed work teams and the increasing emphasis on business awareness in the software development community, individual developers are asked to play a more active role in interfacing with customers. This new role poses a challenge for many engineers who may need guidance to improve their effectiveness in customer interaction. These patterns are the beginning of a pattern language to address that need.
