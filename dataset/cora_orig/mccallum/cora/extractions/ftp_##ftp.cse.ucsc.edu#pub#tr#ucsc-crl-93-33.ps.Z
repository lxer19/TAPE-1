Abstract: A hidden Markov model (HMM) has been developed to find protein coding genes in E. coli DNA using E. coli genome DNA sequence from the EcoSeq6 database maintained by Kenn Rudd. This HMM includes states that model the codons and their frequencies in E. coli genes, as well as the patterns found in the intergenic region, including repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences and the Shine-Delgarno motif. To account for potential sequencing errors and or frameshifts in raw genomic DNA sequence, it allows for the (very unlikely) possiblity of insertions and deletions of individual nucleotides within a codon. The parameters of the HMM are estimated using approximately one million nucleotides of annotated DNA in EcoSeq6 and the model tested on a disjoint set of contigs containing about 325,000 nucleotides. The HMM finds the exact locations of about 80% of the known E. coli genes, and approximate locations for about 10%. It also finds several potentially new genes, and locates several places were insertion or deletion errors and or frameshifts may be present in the contigs. Based on further examination and analysis of the results from the parser, we describe a new putative S-adenosyl-L-methionine methyltransferase domain that appears to be present in proteins from a variety of phylogenetically diverse organisms and organelles.

Reference-contexts: Here we describe a new computer method for locating the protein coding genes in unannotated E. coli contigs and translating them into protein sequences. There are two principle methods for finding genes, most of which have been incorporated into systems that analyse eucaryotic DNA <ref> [3] </ref>. The first locates signals in DNA like promotor sequences and splice junctions using techniques such as neural networks [4, 5, 6] or statistical methods [7, 8, 9]. <p> The second approach scores a certain window of DNA in various ways in order to decide whether the window belongs to a coding or a non-coding region (reviewed in [10]). Staden and McLachlan <ref> [11, 3] </ref> proposed deviation from average codon usage as a way of determining the probability that the window is coding or not. <p> Later, Gribskov et al. [12] used a similar measure as a part of their "codon preference plot", but their measure did not require the knowledge of an average codon usage from other sources. Most other scoring methods are related to codon usage in some way <ref> [13, 3] </ref>. Recently, neural networks [4, 14, 15, 16] and Markov chains [17, 18, 19] have been used to analyze coding (and non-coding) regions. <p> The role of the codon HMMs in Figures 1 and 3 is similar to the role played by codon usage statistics in many other gene finding methods <ref> [3] </ref>. Codon usage statistics are far from what would be expected if they were based on randomly chosen nucleotides (see Table 1). In our model, the codons in a gene are considered random and independent.

Predicted genes often compete with a "gene" on the opposite strand that is in the complementary reading frame. These so-called "shadow genes" <ref> [20] </ref> arise because coding regions have an excess of self-complementary RNY (R:purine, Y: pyrimidine) type codons [46]. The codons that correspond to stop codons on the other strand (TTA, TCA, and CTA) are uncommon codons which enhance the probability of long ORFs opposite from real genes.

The HMM we use to find genes in E. coli is much larger and more complex than those used in the early HMM work. <p> Since only one strand is modelled, the HMM is applied twice, once to the direct strand and then to the complementary strand. The basic HMM architecture is identical to our earlier work <ref> [29] </ref>, but here it is organised into a series of looping structures (Figure 3) containing explicit submodels for each of the 64 codons and for gene overlaps. <p> Since EcoSeq6 is not fully annotated yet (K. Rudd, personal communication), our results should assist in identifying the locations of new genes and highlighting errors and or inconsistencies in the data. For each contig in this test set we used the Viterbi algorithm <ref> [41, 29] </ref>, a standard dynamic programming procedure for HMMs, to find its most likely path through the hidden states of the HMM. Based on the stochastic model represented by our HMM, this path was then used to define a parse of the contig into genes separated by intergenic regions. <p> The simplest HMM used in this research is illustrated in Figure 1 and consists of a collection of rings, all connected to a central state. Each ring possesses one or more HMMs whose structure is essentially the same as that used in our work on modelling protein families <ref> [29] </ref>. There is one codon HMM for each of the 61 DNA triplets that code for amino acids as well as a ring which generates the intergenic region and its flanking stop and start codons. <p> For a given contig of E. coli DNA, the most likely random walk through the HMM that generates this sequence is calculated with a dynamic programming method known as the Viterbi algorithm (described in [41]; see also <ref> [29] </ref>). <p> To allow for the possiblity of frameshifts and sequencing errors, insertions or deletions are modelled in the same manner that insertions and deletions are modelled in our 7 HMMs built for protein families <ref> [29] </ref> (see Figure 1). For each of the three nucleotides in the codon independently, there is a very small probability, P indel , that that nucleotide is deleted (i.e. missing in the sequence). <p> The parameters of the short and long intergenic models were established by a learning procedure known as the forward-backward algorithm, a special case of the more general EM method [45]. A detailed description of the forward-backward algorithm can be found elsewhere [41]. In our implementation <ref> [29] </ref>, we use the algorithm to find a maximum a posteriori setting of the parameters given the training sequences.

The prior probabilities are exactly like those used in [29], but rather than estimating this prior from other sources, we use a uniform prior on the four possible nucleotides in each HMM state that generates a nucleotide.

The only significant difference is that the distributions on the four nucleotides in what are called "insert states" in [29] are estimated from the training sequences here, rather than being "hardwired" to the uniform distribution. The long intergenic model (Figure 4) was trained on regions with 10 or more bases between the stop and start codons, roughly the minimum length of an intergenic region with a Shine-Delgarno pattern.

Reference-contexts: To avoid modelling any DNA sequence as a gene with many errors or frameshifts, the probability of this behavior is small. Models for certain intergenic features such as repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences (REPs) <ref> [38, 39] </ref>, emerged from what were initially more generic models during the HMM training procedure i.e. estimation of the parameters of the HMM. <p> For example, it discovers a structure about 5 to 10 nucleotides before the start codon that corresponds to the well known Shine-Delgarno sequence [43] (positions marked 36-40 in 5-18) resemble a repetitive extragenic palindrome or REP sequence <ref> [38, 39] </ref>. All of these features are considered by the Viterbi method when matching a segment of the sequence to one of the intergenic models and thus provide statistical information not used in other gene-finding methods.

Reference-contexts: The HMM was trained on approximately one million nucleotides from the EcoSeq6 database of labelled genes (Kenn Rudd, personal communication; <ref> [40] </ref>) and tested on the remainder (about 325,000 nucleotides). Since EcoSeq6 is not fully annotated yet (K. Rudd, personal communication), our results should assist in identifying the locations of new genes and highlighting errors and or inconsistencies in the data. <p> The detailed structure of the long intergenic model is shown in Figure 4. Training Data We used the EcoSeq6 database <ref> [40, 44] </ref> maintained and provided to us by Kenn Rudd (personal communication). It contains about 460 contigs of E. coli DNA but is not fully annotated yet because a significant amount of gene discovery remains to be done (K. Rudd, personal communication).

Reference-contexts: Since EcoSeq6 is not fully annotated yet (K. Rudd, personal communication), our results should assist in identifying the locations of new genes and highlighting errors and or inconsistencies in the data. For each contig in this test set we used the Viterbi algorithm <ref> [41, 29] </ref>, a standard dynamic programming procedure for HMMs, to find its most likely path through the hidden states of the HMM. Based on the stochastic model represented by our HMM, this path was then used to define a parse of the contig into genes separated by intergenic regions. <p> This probability is inverted and employed to locate the beginning and ends of genes. For a given contig of E. coli DNA, the most likely random walk through the HMM that generates this sequence is calculated with a dynamic programming method known as the Viterbi algorithm (described in <ref> [41] </ref>; see also [29]). <p> The parameters of the short and long intergenic models were established by a learning procedure known as the forward-backward algorithm, a special case of the more general EM method [45]. A detailed description of the forward-backward algorithm can be found elsewhere <ref> [41] </ref>. In our implementation [29], we use the algorithm to find a maximum a posteriori setting of the parameters given the training sequences.

Reference-contexts: Approximately 5% were found within 10 codons of the start codon, 5% overlap by at least 60 bases or 50% and about 5% were missed completely. For each of genes predicted by the parser but not labelled in EcoSeq6, we performed a database search using the programme BLASTP <ref> [42] </ref> and the predicted protein sequence. The results indicate that many of these appear to encode known proteins. In addition, there are several instances where the HMM suggests insertion or deletion errors in the labelling of the contigs. <p> We examined genes predicted by the complex parser (after post-processing) in more detail by translating each into the protein sequence and performing a database search using BLAST <ref> [42] </ref> and a non-redundant database composed of Swiss-Prot 27.0, PIR 38.0 and translated GenBank 79.0. Of 286 predicted genes, 95 matched a known protein. Some of these are known E. coli genes which have been not labeled in EcoSeq6 but will be in EcoSeq7 (Kenn Rudd, personal communications).

Reference-contexts: As a result of the training process, the long intergenic region develops patterns, without having to explicitly encode them. For example, it discovers a structure about 5 to 10 nucleotides before the start codon that corresponds to the well known Shine-Delgarno sequence <ref> [43] </ref> (positions marked 36-40 in 5-18) resemble a repetitive extragenic palindrome or REP sequence [38, 39].

Reference-contexts: Predicted genes often compete with a "gene" on the opposite strand that is in the complementary reading frame. These so-called "shadow genes" [20] arise because coding regions have an excess of self-complementary RNY (R:purine, Y: pyrimidine) type codons <ref> [46] </ref>. The codons that correspond to stop codons on the other strand (TTA, TCA, and CTA) are uncommon codons which enhance the probability of long ORFs opposite from real genes.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that there is a significant drift in the average G+C content in the E. coli genome over periods of several kilobases that cannot be accounted for solely by the change from coding to noncoding regions <ref> [70] </ref>. A new class of "Walking Markov" models has been proposed to model this phenomenon. The results of some preliminary calculations to see if extreme variations in G+C content could account for some of our erroneous predictions are shown in Figure 6.

Reference-contexts: The genes labeled `incorrectly predicted' are those that do not fall in the categories `perfect' or `almost perfect', so a reasonable fraction of those are actually useful predictions. The modularity of HMM design, exploited in modeling proteins <ref> [71] </ref>, is a great advantage in building complex models to capture the structure of biological sequences. In future work, we plan to incorporate more explicit models of intergenic regulatory regions and of structural RNA coding regions.
