Abstract: Causality plays an essential role in reasoning about actions, and much of the research on the area deals with the problem of formalizing causality. In this article we pursue the idea that causality can be understood as an abstraction, and that one can write theories in which causality can be left implicit in the formalization of dynamic worlds. In particular, we identify one form of causality, which we call triggered causality, and illustrate it with a simple standard example taken from the literature on causation. Later, we relate our approach to causality to the one proposed by Lin in his recent research. We establish the proposition that, for a restricted class of theories based on explicit causation, it is possible to find a translation of a causal theory into a theory with embedded causation and triggers.

Reference-contexts: In particular, we consider that: Actions are instantaneous. Actions with durations can be modeled as pairs of instantaneous actions; one action starts the action with duration, and the other ends it. This approach to represent actions with durations is discussed in <ref> (Baier & Pinto 1998) </ref>. Actions can be initiated by agents or they can be natural. Natural actions are triggered by nature. Thus, they occur when the state of the world is such that the actions must occur.

Reference-contexts: The use of occlusion in this latter approach turns out to be similar to Lin's use of the Causes predicate, as discussed in <ref> (Gustafsson & Doherty 1996) </ref>. In future work, we would like to extend our comparison to other approaches based on explicit causality. As suggested by Lin (personal communication) such a comparison would shed some light on the issue of when one should use implicit or explicit causation.

Reference-contexts: The main goal of this article is to compare our approach to an existing approach to modeling causation, as pertains to the ramification problem or the reasoning with indirect effects. In particular, we compare our proposal to Fangzhen Lin's work on causality and indirect effects <ref> (Lin 1995) </ref>. We establish the result that Causal Theories (in Lin's style) can be translated, in some cases, into theories with implicit causation and triggers in the style that we proposed in (Pinto 1998c). <p> We discuss a simple example used in the research literature on the ramification problem (for example, (Kartha & Lifschitz 1994; Thielscher 1997; Grunwald 1998)). Our treatment of the switches example can also be applied to other classical problems used to illustrate the ramification problem; for instance Lin's suitcase example <ref> (Lin 1995) </ref> and the stuffy room example of Ginsberg and Smith's (Ginsberg & Smith 1988). A common approach to the representation of knowledge about dynamic worlds recognizes actions/events and states to be primitive classes of objects in the world. States can also be associated with metric time. <p> In a later section, we show how this same problem is solved using Lin's methodology <ref> (Lin 1995) </ref>. A Detailed View of the Light Switches Example In this section we introduce a new formalization of the light switches examples. We make use of the concurrent Situation Calculus (Pinto 1994; Reiter 1996), although one could use other specification languages instead (e.g., the Circum-scriptive Event Calculus (Shanahan 1995)).

Reference-contexts: This behavior can also be modeled with the introduction of a natural event, that results from a continuous process (Pinto 1994; Kelley 1996; Reiter 1996). Therefore, state constraint (23) is a simplification, which, for the purposes of the example, yields the expected results. Following <ref> (Pinto 1994) </ref>, we can derive new effect axioms from the state constraint (23) and the effect axioms (21) and (22): Poss (c; s) ^ End f low 2 c :Light (do (c; s)); (24) Poss (c; s) ^ Start f low 2 c Light (do (c; s)): (25) Successor state axioms <p> Given these new axioms, we now need to derive successor state axioms for the new fluents F r .

Let P (T ) denote the theory that results from replacing the new effect axioms (definitions) with the corresponding successor state.

Reference-contexts: However, this is a rather technical result which does not necessarily shed any light on the more philosophical question: which approach is more natural? When we write theories of action (for examples, see <ref> (Pinto 1998a) </ref>), we attempt to describe reality at a level of abstraction that would allow an automated reasoner to reach the correct answers for given reasoning tasks.

Reference-contexts: Introduction. In a recent article <ref> (Pinto 1998c) </ref> we proposed to treat causation as an abstraction that can be extracted from theories of action as opposed to treat it as a primitive notion from which theories of action should be built. Furthermore, we postulated that causation is an abstraction that hides a complex or unknown reality. <p> Research in Knowledge Representation has led to the discovery of several problems that are inherent to the enterprise of building theories of action. In <ref> (Pinto 1998c) </ref> we discussed the modeling of indeterminate actions and the ramification problem. <p> In particular, we compare our proposal to Fangzhen Lin's work on causality and indirect effects (Lin 1995). We establish the result that Causal Theories (in Lin's style) can be translated, in some cases, into theories with implicit causation and triggers in the style that we proposed in <ref> (Pinto 1998c) </ref>. The relevance of this result is twofold, it lends credibility to our approach based on implicit causation, and it provides a better understanding of the space of possible formalisms for reasoning about actions and causality. <p> As suggested by Lin (personal communication) such a comparison would shed some light on the issue of when one should use implicit or explicit causation. In this article, we present the modeling approach introduced in <ref> (Pinto 1998c) </ref>, we discuss one simple circuit example, used to illustrate problems that may arise in the presence of state constraints. The Modeling Approach In this article we explore the consequences of viewing causation as an abstract notion. <p> Therefore, the resulting theory might include natural actions which do not necessarily have analogues in reality. We be lieve that this should in general be the case. Whether this turns out to be true is a question of pragmatics. Conclusion In <ref> (Pinto 1998c) </ref> we proposed to treat causality as an abstraction defined in terms of primitive causation. The level of 5 We assume finite axiomatizations. granularity of the axiomatization is defined by primitive cau-sation, expressed with direct action effects, state constraints, and natural occurrences.

Reference-contexts: Below, we specify the sets of axioms structured according to the style of axiomatization proposed by Reiter <ref> (Reiter 1991) </ref>. Unique Names Axioms Uniqueness of names is assumed for actions. <p> do (a; s)) _ [Light (s) ^ connected (Sw 1 ; do (a; s)) ^ connected (Sw 2 ; do (a; s))]: which reduces to: Poss (a; s) Light (do (a; s)) connected (Sw 1 ; do (a; s)) ^ connected (Sw 2 ; do (a; s)): By using regression <ref> (Reiter 1991) </ref> and the successor state axiom for connected, we obtain the final successor state axiom for Light: Poss (a; s) Light (do (a; s)) [a = toggle (Sw 1 ) ^ :connected (Sw 1 ; s) _ connected (Sw 1 ; s) ^ a 6= toggle (Sw 1 )] ^ <p> Given these new axioms, we now need to derive successor state axioms for the new fluents F r . The state constraints of the form (43) correspond to what we called stratified definitions (Pinto 1994), where we showed a mechanism, also based on the use of Reiter's regression operator <ref> (Reiter 1991) </ref>, to obtain successor state axioms for the defined flu-ents. Let P (T ) denote the theory that results from replacing the new effect axioms (definitions) with the corresponding successor state.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, all the actions performed must be possible in the situations in which they are performed. Concurrent actions are treated as sets of primitive actions (as in <ref> (Reiter 1996) </ref>). Thus, 2 is used as a relation between simple actions and concurrent actions. We write a 2 c to mean that action a is a part of the concurrent action c.

We make use of the concurrent Situation Calculus (Pinto 1994; Reiter 1996), although one could use other specification languages instead (e.g., the Circum-scriptive Event Calculus <ref> (Shanahan 1995) </ref>). Concurrency is not necessary to model this example, but it is necessary in a general setting, as evidenced in a later section, where we compare Lin's causal approach to the one described here. We assume some familiarity with the Situation Calculus.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, (flipping switches) one would have an analogous causal rule for Sw 2 causing Light if Sw 1 is on. This causal information, if properly used, would allow us to compute yet another state <ref> (Thielscher 1997) </ref>. After a stable state is reached, the state of the world should be one in which the light is on. However, there are other ways to deal with this problem. First, observe that the constraint (1) is not really faithful to the reality we are modeling.
