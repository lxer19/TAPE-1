Abstract: A computational study for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem is presented. Thereby emphasis is put on the structure of the solution space as it appears for adaptive search. A statistical analysis of the search spaces reveals the impacts of inherent properties of the problem on adaptive heuristics.

Reference-contexts: The k = 1 technique is also used by Taillard [10] who confirms the condition for easiness, especially for rectangular instances with n m. 1 Each precedence relation on a machine corresponds to the direction of a disjunctive arc in the disjunctive graph model of the JSP <ref> [1] </ref>. Since prec i (j; k) holds without job k being the direct successor of j on the i-th machine, a precedence relation does not necessarily represent a Hamiltonian arc. D. C. Mattfeld and C.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Adaptive heuristics receive increasing attention in the field of combinatorial optimization. Although heuristics like Evolutionary Algorithms and Simulated Annealing have been successfully applied to many combinatorial problems, current research is unable to explain adequately why or when such approaches are likely to succeed or fail <ref> [3, 9] </ref>. It is a matter of experience that the performance of adaptive heuristics strongly depends on the configuration of the underlying search space [7]. Due to limitations of theoretical analysis, statistical methods have been proposed in order to assess the configuration space [8]. <p> Local optima of a JSP instance do not share a considerably amount of precedence relations. For the TSP completely different results are obtained, because for symmetric instances 2-optimal tours share about 30% of their edges <ref> [3] </ref>. These results confirm our above conjecture that local optima are located far away from each other. 2 For the 10fi50 instances the occurrences of the mn (n1) = 24 500 possible direct predecessor operations are counted.

Reference-contexts: Search spaces of combinatorial problems show apparent similarities to genotype spaces considered in quantitative genetics [13]. There, the fitness map over the genotype space formed the notion of the fitness landscape <ref> [4] </ref>. The paper continues these lines of research with respect to the job shop scheduling problem (JSP). It is organized as follows: In Section 2 we introduce the notion of the fitness landscape. In Section 3 we configure the JSP search space by means of a neighbourhood definition. <p> More generally a landscape refers to a mapping of a finite and structured set (graph) into the real numbers [13]. Explaining the success of Evolutionary Algorithms it can be assumed that it depends on certain properties of the artificial fitness landscape. Kauffman <ref> [4] </ref> lists eight properties of landscapes, of which the following three are considered to be of predominant importance. <p> In contradiction to plain shaping, which makes a landscape difficult to search, we conclude that easy instances possess a more mountainous landscape. This interrelation between the correlation of landscapes and problem easiness is also confirmed by other research <ref> [4] </ref>. For the JSP we therefore conjecture that the existence of massifs in the landscape has a strong influence on the effectiveness of search. 5 Summary and Conclusion In this paper we have investigated the solution space of the JSP.

Reference-contexts: E.g. a symmetric n-city TSP shows a correlation length of h fl = n=2 using the 2-opt neighbourhood [8]. If the correlation length cannot be determined analytically, a value h fl with (h fl ) = 1=2 seems reasonable <ref> [5] </ref>. D. C. Mattfeld and C. Bierwirth / A Search Space Analysis of the JSP 9 The obtained correlation length can be taken from the abscissa ((h) = 0:5). It strongly differs for easy instances (h fl = 270) and hard ones (h fl = 980).

Reference-contexts: Landscapes of harder instances show a larger extension, i.e. it efforts more steps to traverse them. As well these landscapes consist of more points than the ones of easy instances. This is due to the fact that in harder instances more variations (entropy) of solution characteristics occur <ref> [6] </ref>. The structure of hard instances induce a more plain landscape. All this lead to the evidence that search navigation in easy instances can identify favorable solutions more properly. Generally it must be stated that JSP landscapes are difficult to search for adaptive heuristics.

Due to their construction five instances are very hard to solve while the others are comparably easy, see Table 1. The instances are generated as follows: The set of machines involved is divided into k (1 k m) equally sized subsets.

Reference-contexts: Introducing landscapes for the JSP requires the definition of a suitable neighbourhood. An overview on various neighbourhood definitions is given in <ref> [11] </ref>. The basic neighbourhood definition has been proposed by Van Laarhoven et al. [12]. Let S be the set of all feasible schedules to a problem instance. A schedule s 1 2 S is moved into s 2 by reversing the order of two successive operations on a machine.
