Abstract: This paper describes the Deep Space Network Antenna Operations Planner (DPLAN) : a system that automatically generates antenna tracking plans for a set of highly sensitive radio science and telecommunications antennas. DPLAN accepts as inpu t an equipment configuration and a set of requested antenna track services. The system then uses a knowledge base of antenna operations procedures to produce a plan of activities that will provide the requested services using the allocated equipment. DPLAN produces this plan using an integration of hierarchical task network (HTN) and operator-based planning. A prototype of the DPLAN system was successfully demonstrated in Febr uary 1995 at NASAs experimental DSN station, DSS-13, on a series of Voyager tracks. Based on this successful demonstration, DPLAN is being considered for inclusion in the larger Network Monitor and Control (NMC) upgrade underway projected to save NASA over $9 million per year in operations costs.

Reference-contexts: Because of space constraints we only describe the most important aspects of reasoning about plan quality in the DSN antenna operations application - for further details the reader is referred to <ref> [3] </ref>. Since there is often more than one correct plan for a particular antenna operation, it is important for a planning system to be able to compare a set of final plans using user identified plan quality measures.

Reference-contexts: In particular, ordering constraints that apply to very specialized goals, as opposed to very general ones, can be more easily expressed through precondition/effect schemas than through decomposition rules. For more information on the advantages and disadvantages of employing HTN and operator-based planning techniques for this type of domain see <ref> [4] </ref>. An Operations Example In order to begin the planning process, DPLAN is provided with a problem specification that contains several lists of information. Specifically, each problem contains a list of decomposition goals, along with possible lists of initial state predicates, static state predicates, and final state predicates.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, operator-based planners work in a backward-chaining manner by taking a given goal and attempting to resolve its preconditions. Operator-based planners perform all reasoning at the lowest level of abstraction and provide a strict semantics for defining operator definitions. An HTN planner <ref> [7] </ref> uses task reduction rules to decompose abstract goals into lower level tasks. HTN planners can encode many different types of information into task reductions. By defining or not defining certain reduction refinements, the designer can direct the planner towards particular search paths in certain contexts.
