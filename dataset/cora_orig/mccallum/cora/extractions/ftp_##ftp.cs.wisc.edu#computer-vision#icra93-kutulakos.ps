Abstract: We present an approach for solving the path planning problem for a mobile robot operating in an unknown, three dimensional environment containing obstacles of arbitrary shape. The main contributions of this paper are (1) an analysis of the type of sensing information that is necessary and sufficient for solving the path planning problem in such environments, and (2) the development of a framework for designing a provably- correct algorithm to solve this problem. Working from first principles, without any assumptions about the environment of the robot or its sensing capabilities, our analysis shows that the ability to explore the obstacle surfaces (i.e., to make all their points visible) is intrinsically linked with the ability to plan the motion of the robot. We argue that current approaches to the path planning problem with incomplete information simply do not extend to the general three-dimensional case, and that qualitatively different algorithms are needed.

Reference-contexts: These approaches emphasized the mutual independence between sensing and action and generated interest in solutions to motion planning problems where complete information is available at the time of robot action or decision making. The Piano Movers problem <ref> [1] </ref> was subsequently formulated in order to solve the path planning problem in cases where the environment of the robot was already accurately known.

In this paper we study the path planning problem under the purposive, act-while-thinking paradigm. <p> Example 2.1 (Tactile sensing) If S (c; S) = fcg for c 2 &lt; 3 V S , the automaton can only determine the three- dimensional coordinates of its current position, an assumption used in the path-planning literature (e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>). 2 Hollow objects are not allowed under this definition, since this would imply that the surface bounding the object is not connected. <p> Although the target location t may be reachable from s, it may or may not be reachable by a collision-free path on . If s and t are reachable on , one of the known planar path planning algorithms (e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>) will be able to solve this path planning problem. On the other hand, if t is not reachable, the robot must plan its motion by moving outside of (Figure 2). <p> assume that the robot can move on the obstacle surfaces, and therefore paths that are tangential to the obstacle surfaces or lie on these surfaces will be considered acceptable. 3.2 Algorithms A 2D and A E Simply for the sake of specificity we assume that the robot uses algorithm Bug1 <ref> [4] </ref> for solving the two-dimensional motion planning subproblem. Briefly, a robot using the Bug1 algorithm moves toward the target in a straight line in until an obstacle is encountered or until the target is reached.

Reference-contexts: The algorithms rely on the fact that the obstacles consist of a finite collection of planar faces, and produce paths whose lengths diverge in the limit. For example, the exploration algorithm proposed by Rao <ref> [9] </ref> has a complexity depending on the number of faces in the environment's description. This description, however, becomes infinite when the obstacles are smooth surfaces. Consequently, exploration becomes an infinitely complex task even when the environment contains geometrically simple surfaces (e.g., a sphere).

Reference-contexts: Given M &gt; 0, there is a point t 2 ^ S such that A plans a path between s and t of length greater than M . This proposition implies that determining whether or not t is reachable is an unsolvable (or undecidable <ref> [12] </ref>) problem since if t is not reachable, the automaton's algorithm will not terminate.
