Abstract: We show that the Steepest Descent Algorithm in connection with wiggly energies yields minimizing sequences that converge to a global minimum of the associated non-quasiconvex variational integrals. We introduce a multi-level infinite dimensional variant of the Steepest Descent Algorithm designed to compute complex microstructures by forming non-smooth minimizers from the smooth initial guess. We apply this multilevel method to the minimization of the variational problems associated with martensitic branching.

Reference-contexts: The second route is via time dependent-formulations. Considering, for example, conservation of the linear momenta the investigation are related to asymptotics [21], [22], <ref> [44] </ref>, [9], [30]. It is now understood in one spatial dimension [22], and, in some cases in higher dimensions [30], that for global and smooth deformations we have lim t!1 E (u (t)) &gt; 0. The implicit spatial resolution is most likely based on the character of the considered dynamics.
