Abstract: Georgia Tech won the Office Cleanup Event at the 1994 AAAI Mobile Robot Competition with a multi-robot cooperating team. This paper describes the design and implementation of these reactive trash-collecting robots, including details of multiagent cooperation, color vision for the detection of perceptual object classes, temporal sequencing of behaviors for task completion, and a language for specifying motor schema-based robot behaviors.

Individual schemas are primitive behaviors that are combined to generate more complex emergent behaviors. <p> Individual behaviors for each of the several steps in the "clean up office" task were developed and tested on the robots, and appropriate gain values were determined empirically.

Sequenced coordination or temporal sequencing is the process by which the robot control system moves through a series of distinct behaviors [10, 5].

In hopes of transferring these results to the multiagent cleanup task, we modelled the cooperative behaviors of Ganymede; Io and Callisto on the robot behaviors used in the earlier investigations. Even though communication was shown to improve performance, quantitative results demonstrated efficient cooperation between robots without explicit communication.
