Abstract: This paper proposes a statistical framework for computing medial axis of 2D shapes. In this paper the computation of medial axis is posed as a statistical inference problem not as a mathematical transform. This method contributes to three important aspects in computing the medial axis. I) Prior knowledge is adopted for axes and junctions so that the axes around junctions are regularized. II) Multiple interpretations of axes are possible, each being assigned a probability. III) A novel stochastic jump-diffusion process is proposed for estimating both axes and junctions in a Markov random field. We argue that the stochastic algorithm for computing medial axis is compatible with existing algorithms for image segmentation, such as region growing[33], snake[8] and region competition[29]. Thus it provides a new direction for computing medial axis from real textured images. Experiments are demonstrated on both synthetic and real shapes. This algorithm has been successfully applied to shape learning and sampling in a companion paper[32].

Reference-contexts: The multiple solutions computed in the early bottom-up process are then passed to the high level object recognition process. In the computer vision literature, we have noticed some interesting work along this line. In 1984, Tsao and Fu published perhaps the first paper on skeleton of stochastic nature <ref> [26] </ref>. In [26], a skeleton graph is computed in a deterministic way based on maximum disks, and then random shape instances are generated by either perturbing the coordinates of the points on the skeleton or changing the radius at a skeleton point. <p> In the computer vision literature, we have noticed some interesting work along this line.

Reference-contexts: However, there is a major gap between the existing algorithms for computing medial axis and the algorithms for image segmentation. The latter are mostly studied in the statistics framework, such as region growing [33], active contour (SNAKE)[8], and region competition <ref> [29] </ref>. In contrast, medial axes are mostly computed in a deterministic manner. This incompatibility poses a major barrier for extracting medial axis and object shapes from real textured images. Motivated by the above observations, we propose to define medial axis locally or more precisely on a Markov random field.

Reference-contexts: Since then many efficient algorithms have been proposed for extracting medial axis from 2D shapes, and these methods are divided into four categories: active contour method [13], Voronoi diagram [21], shape evolution by partial differential equations and level sets [10, 22, 24], and tracking deformable circles <ref> [30] </ref>. Some methods were also proposed for computing segments of symmetry axes from grey level images; for example, using difference of low-pass filters [4], annular symmetry operators following edge detection [9], and diffusion equations [24, 25]. Recently, Zhu and Yuille demonstrated a flexible object recognition system called FORMS. <p> Recently, Zhu and Yuille demonstrated a flexible object recognition system called FORMS. FORMS transforms 2D shapes into attribute skeleton graphs by which objects are recognized in a bottom-up/top-down loop <ref> [30] </ref>. Along this vein, Liu, Geiger and Kohn developed a variational method for extracting the skeleton tree for object recognition [17]. <p> axis is notoriously sensitive to boundary noise, the main thrust of existing algorithms for extracting medial axis is to overcome the robustness problem, and various methods have been proposed, such as trimming extra branches [21], smoothing boundaries by diffusion equations [10, 23] or using deformable circles instead of hard disks <ref> [30] </ref>. The significance of a branch of the axis can also be measured [13]. Though this problem has been well addressed, there are some other problems which have received less attention in the literatures. <p> For example, figure 11 displays the computed M which determines three junctions of degree=3 instead of one junction of degree=6 as shown in figure 15, even though the latter has lower energy. The split and merge of the junctions was considered in the FORMS system by 19 Zhu etc <ref> [30] </ref> in a top-down process which matches the medial axis graph to the model in order to obtain the best match.

Reference-contexts: Liu et al adopted a dynamic programming method, and the energy function is similar in spirit to the one that we used for computing the mapping function. Their work was published independent of the conference version of our work <ref> [31] </ref>. In this paper, we propose a stochastic algorithm for computing the medial axis in two iterative stages. 1).

Reference-contexts: These values are chosen empirically, and the algorithm is insensitive to the selections. In theory, the precise function for C (s; OE (s)) can be learned from training examples in a non-parametric form based on the maximum entropy principle <ref> [32] </ref>. Remark I. In E (OE), as the angles p , s are relative and distances ds, r (s) are normalized, the probability p (OEj) is invariant to translation, rotation, and scaling. Remark II. <p> Therefore region based information can be characterized and semantics, such as parallelism and symmetry, can be modeled together with the curvature based properties [8] for image segmentation. A probabilistic shape model defined on such graphs is studied in a companion paper <ref> [32] </ref>. 9 3 Compute the mapping function To compute the mapping function OE (s), we first discretize the circular domain [0; 1] into N = L=c segments of equal length with c being a constant. <p> In this paper, the mapping function provides a neighborhood structure, based on which Markov random field models of curves can be explored. The neighborhood and the stochastic algorithms in this paper have been utilized in learning and sampling probability models of shape p () in a companion paper <ref> [32] </ref>. 28 The Markov property of our medial axis definition and the stochastic nature of the algorithm make it plausible for massive parallel computation and simultaneous extraction of medial axes during the segmentation of images as was suggested by experiments in psychology and neuroscience [11, 12].
