Abstract: We are concerned with temporal reasoning problems where there is uncertainty about the order in which events occur. The task of temporal reasoning is to derive an event sequence consistent with a given set of ordering constraints to achieve a goal. Previous research shows that the associated decision problems are hard even for very restricted cases. In this paper, we investigate locality in event ordering and causal dependencies. We present a localized temporal reasoning algorithm that uses subgoals and abstract events to exploit locality. The computational efficiency of our algorithm for a problem instance is quantified by the inherent locality in the instance. We theoretically demonstrate the substantial improvement in performance gained by exploiting locality. This work provides a solid evidence of the usefulness of localized reasoning in exploiting locality.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 4. Temporal projection regarding one-rule events, totally unordered, with a polynomial-size state space is solvable in polynomial time. Proof. For this special case, the PRJ1 task of temporal projection can be reduced to a graph reachability problem, which is solvable in polynomial time <ref> [CLR91] </ref>. We first construct a directed graph G by mapping (1) each state to a distinct vertex in G and (2) each one-rule event that triggers a state transition from a state u to a state v to an arc (u; v) in G. <p> Finally, we examine the event sequence to determine whether it is consistent with the ordering constraints. Since the bipartite match problem can be solved in polynomial time [PS82] <ref> [CLR91] </ref>, this reduction together with Theorem 1 prove that this special case of temporal projection is solvable in polynomial time. 26 Computational Intelligence Theorem 7. <p> Therefore G I = (V; E) is a directed acyclic graph, and the single-source shortest paths problem and thus the graph reachability problem can be solved in O (jV j + jEj) Localized Temporal Reasoning Using Subgoals and Abstract Events 27 time <ref> [CLR91] </ref>. If we adopt the trivial partition, we have jEj chains, and the length l i equals one for each chain. This gives us jS P jfi Q 1im (1+l i )= 2 jPj+jEj vertices, and at most 2 2 (jPj+jEj) arcs.

Reference-contexts: An event changes the system state according to exactly one of the applicable rules; ties are broken arbitrarily when two or more rules are applicable at a time. In this way, each event determines a state-transition relation on the state space determined by P <ref> [LD93] </ref>. We assume that each event in E occurs exactly once. If necessary, we can represent multiple occurrences of an event at distinct points in time by (1) replicating the event a specified number of times, and (2) considering each replica of the event as a distinct event. <p> The associated decision problems for planning [BK91] [Byl91] [Cha87] [DB88] [GN91] and temporal projection [DB88] [NB92] <ref> [LD93] </ref> are hard even for very restricted cases. Dean and Boddy [DB88] study a variant of temporal projection.

We identify (1) the kinds of events, (2) the ordering constraints on events, and (3) the size of the state space, as three important factors influencing computational complexity. <p> which are also applicable to the PRJ1 task and the PRJ2 task after transforming the problem instances accordingly. 2 The proofs for all theorems stated in this paper are provided in Appendix A at the end of this document. 3 The PRJ1 task is considered by Lin and Dean in <ref> [LD93] </ref> and the PRJ2 task is considered by Dean and Boddy in [DB88] and Nebel and Backstrom in [NB92].
