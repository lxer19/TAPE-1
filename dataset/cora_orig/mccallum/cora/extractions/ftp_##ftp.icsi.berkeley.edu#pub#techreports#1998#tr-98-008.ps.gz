Title: From GISystems to GIServices: Spatial Computing on the Internet Marketplace  
Author: Oliver Gunther and Rudolf Muller

Abstract: Many of the functions performed by GIS seem to be amenable to a business model that is fundamentally different from the one we see today. At present, GIS users typically own the hardware and software they use. They pay license and maintenance fees to various vendors. The alternative would be a service-oriented approach where users make their input data available to some GIS service center that performs the necessary computations remotely and sends the results back to the user. Customers pay only for that particular usage of the GIS technology without having to own a GIS. We discuss this business model and associated problems of privacy and ease-of-use. We also give an overview of our MMM system (http://mmm.wiwi.hu-berlin.de), a distributed computing infrastructure that supports this business model.

Reference-contexts: DecisionNet [6, 9] is an organized electronic market for decision support technologies. The market infrastructure consists of agents that support consumers and providers in transactions. The decision technologies themselves reside on provider machines distributed across the Internet. DecisionNet is accessible at http://dnet.sm.nps.navy.mil/. SMART <ref> [1, 2] </ref> is another Internet marketplace model with an emphasis on spatial data and related algorithms. Like MMM and DecisionNet, SMART is based on the asynchronous communication between service providers and consumers.

Reference-contexts: A third kind of support applies to the positioning of a service in a given classification scheme. Finally, support could come in the form of execution agents to be created from service descriptions [8]. Execution planning in GIS marketplaces has been proposed by Abel et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. They define a plan as an acyclic digraph. Its source nodes are data services or data provided by the user, interior nodes represent computational services, and target nodes are results from services. Arcs relate to data flow between data sources, computational services, and data targets. <p> DecisionNet [6, 9] is an organized electronic market for decision support technologies.

Reference-contexts: Another kind of support consists of component frameworks (such as CORBA's vertical common facilities or SunSoft's Java beans) that may serve as starting points for the implementation of a service. Interoperation with Web browsers could then be based on systems like CorbaWeb [21], Webfl <ref> [3] </ref>, and W3Objects [19]. A third kind of support applies to the positioning of a service in a given classification scheme.

Reference-contexts: Its source nodes are data services or data provided by the user, interior nodes represent computational services, and target nodes are results from services. Arcs relate to data flow between data sources, computational services, and data targets. Execution planning may take place manually by means of scripting languages <ref> [4] </ref> or graph editors, or it could be done automatically. Automatic execution planning would generate a plan from a declarative request [15]. A typical example of plan generation comes up in the context of interactive map making (e.g. on a WWW map server).

Reference-contexts: Such marketplaces were first proposed for decision support applications [6, 10]. The Internet technologies underlying such a marketplace can be grouped into four categories: user interfaces, communication, connectivity, and market infrastructure. Any combination of choices from each category defines a middleware <ref> [5] </ref> for an information market. For example, if one takes a Web browser as user interface, HTTP as communication protocol, Web sites for connectivity, and Web search engines as market infrastructure, then one obtains the existing Web.

Reference-contexts: A marketplace should free providers from implementing a fully integrated service, thus significantly reducing their market entry cost.

The Internet technologies underlying such a marketplace can be grouped into four categories: user interfaces, communication, connectivity, and market infrastructure.

Reference-contexts: OGC seeks to make geographic data and geoprocessing an integral part of enterprise information systems. An interesting application of some of the technologies described in this paper has recently been presented by Bhargava and Tettelbach <ref> [12] </ref>. They implemented a waste disposal planner for the Monterey area by combining geographic data about waste disposal points with data about which types of waste are taken at what price. Providers of waste disposal services can register their location and prices online.

Reference-contexts: Method session objects (MSOs) wrap and describe computational services. Data and method repositories are organized along subject-specific taxonomies. In MMM's initial application domains statistical computing and operations research these are based on the Guide to Available Mathematical Software (GAMS) taxonomy <ref> [13] </ref>. Meta objects may be stored in different formats, such as XML documents or relational database tables. Figure 6 gives an XML example of an MSO for a Matlab routine, which resides on a Princeton WWW server.

Reference-contexts: The non-commercial Network-Enabled Optimization System (NEOS) <ref> [14] </ref> of Argonne National Laboratory can also be regarded as an electronic marketplace for computational services. NEOS allows users to solve complex optimization problems via a Web interface (http://www-c.mcs.anl.gov/home/otc/Server/neos.html) and a proprietary client that users may install locally.

Reference-contexts: The repository may also serve for certification purposes by implementing ratings, annotations, and reviews of services. Repositories may simply be the result of an integration of services. As an example, consider the TSIMMIS architecture <ref> [23, 16] </ref> of wrappers and mediators (Fig. 2). The mediator between the application and the wrapper is able to decompose a query and spawn subqueries to the wrappers. The wrapper then translates the incoming queries into requests to the encapsulated legacy system.

Reference-contexts: Payment schemes would follow this service-oriented approach: rather than buying a whole system, users only pay for the particular usage of the vendor's software. A direct consequence of such a shift from geographic information systems to geographic information services would be the rise of an electronic market <ref> [20] </ref> for spatial data and services. Anybody with Internet access could act as both provider and consumer of related goods. In Section 2 we discuss electronic markets for information goods in more detail.
