Abstract: This paper investigates the notion of resource-bounded genericity developed by Ambos-Spies, Fleischhack, and Huwig. Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn have recently shown that every language that is t(n)-random over the uniform probability measure is t(n)-generic. It is shown here that, in fact, every language that is t(n)-random over any strongly positive, t(n)-computable probability measure is t(n)-generic. Roughly speaking, this implies that, when genericity is used to prove a resource-bounded measure result, the result is not specific to the underlying probability measure.

Reference-contexts: This method, first discovered and applied by Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn [6] has since been applied by Ambos-Spies <ref> [1, 2] </ref> and Ambos-Spies and Mayordomo [4]. Time-bounded genericity has also been characterized as a kind of strong immunity property by Balcazar and Mayordomo [8]. <p> More complete expositions of the ideas reviewed here may be found in [19, 21, 4]. We first recall the well-known notion of a (Borel) probability measure on C. Definition. A probability measure on C is a function - : f0; 1g ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> such that -() = 1, and for all w 2 f0; 1g fl -(w) = -(w0) + -(w1): Intuitively, -(w) is the probability that A 2 C w when we "choose a language A 2 C according to the probability measure -." We sometimes write -(C w ) for <p> Examples. 1. A sequence of biases is a sequence ~ fi = (fi 0 ; fi 1 ; fi 2 ; : : :), where each fi i 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Given a sequence of biases ~ fi, the ~ fi-coin-toss probability measure (also called the ~ fi-product probability measure) is the probability measure ~ fi defined by jwj1 Y ((1 fi i ) (1 w [i]) + fi i w [i]) fl . <p> Let t : N ! N. A probability measure on C is t (n)-exact if - = f0; 1g fl ! Q " <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and there is an algorithm that, for all w 2 f0; 1g fl , computes -(w) in O (t (jwj)) steps.

The uniform probability measure is clearly t (n)-exact for t (n) n, as is the probability measure fi , provided that fi 2 Q " [0; 1]. In contrast, even if the biases in the sequence ~ fi = (fi 0 ; fi 1 ; :::) are all rational, ~ fi will fail to be t (n)- exact if the computation of fi i from i is too difficult (or impossible). <p> used this method to prove a new result on resource-bounded measure, namely, the Small Span Theorem for P ktt -reductions. (This extended the Small Span Theorems for P m -reductions and P 1tt -reductions proven by Juedes and Lutz [11] and Lindner [12], respectively.) Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn [4], Ambos-Spies <ref> [1] </ref>, and Ambos-Spies and Mayordomo [4] have also used this method to reprove a number of previously known results on resource-bounded measure. To date, every such genericity proof of a resource-bounded measure result corresponds directly to a martingale proof with the same combinatorial content.

Let c 2, and let A f0; 1g fl be n c -generic. <p> is , the uniform probability measure, we usually omit it from the above notation and terminology, referring simply to the class RAND -(t (n)), consisting of all t (n)- random languages, and the set RAND (p), consisting of all p-random languages. 3.2 --Random Languages are Generic Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn <ref> [6] </ref> have shown that every language that is t (n)-random over the uniform probability measure is t (n)- generic. The following theorem extends this result to arbitrary, strongly positive, s (n)-exact probability measures on C. Theorem 3.3. Let s; t : N ! N. <p> Proof. This follows immediately from Theorem 3.3 with s (n) = t (n). 2 Fix a time bound t (n) n 2 . For the uniform probability measure, in addition to proving that RAND (t (n)) GEN (t (n)), Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn <ref> [6] </ref> proved that this inclusion is proper, by establishing the existence of sparse t (n)-generic languages. <p> These facts were proven by Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn <ref> [6] </ref>, who also pointed out that they give a new method for proving results in resource-bounded measure. <p> For example, to prove that a set X of languages has measure 0 in E (i.e., (XjE) = 0), it is sufficient by (13) to prove that X " E contains no n k -generic language. Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn <ref> [6] </ref> used this method to prove a new result on resource-bounded measure, namely, the Small Span Theorem for P ktt -reductions. (This extended the Small Span Theorems for P m -reductions and P 1tt -reductions proven by Juedes and Lutz [11] and Lindner [12], respectively.) Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn [4], Ambos-Spies <p> Nevertheless, time-bounded genericity is a very new method that gives an elegant, alternative mode of thinking about resource-bounded measure, so it may very well lead to such discoveries. Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn <ref> [6] </ref> have also pointed out that there are limitations on this genericity method. <p> As pointed out by Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn <ref> [6] </ref>, this weakness of the genericity method becomes a strength when one adopts the view that the method does not merely give alternative proofs of measure results, but rather gives proofs of stronger results.

Reference-contexts: Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn [6] used this method to prove a new result on resource-bounded measure, namely, the Small Span Theorem for P ktt -reductions. (This extended the Small Span Theorems for P m -reductions and P 1tt -reductions proven by Juedes and Lutz [11] and Lindner <ref> [12] </ref>, respectively.) Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn [4], Ambos-Spies [1], and Ambos-Spies and Mayordomo [4] have also used this method to reprove a number of previously known results on resource-bounded measure.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the 1990's, the development and application of resource-bounded measure a complexity-theoretic generalization of classical Lebesgue measure developed by Lutz <ref> [14] </ref> has shed new light on some of the most central questions in computational complexity. Progress that has resulted from the use of resource-bounded measure by now the work of many investigators has been surveyed in [15, 4]. <p> It was then shown in [4] that, with a more careful formulation of these classes, the argument in [6] can be made to achieve (3).) Facts (1) and (2) follow immediately from (3) and the known facts <ref> [14, 7] </ref> that almost every language in E is n k -random, and almost every language in E 2 is 2 (log n) k -random. Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn [6] also pointed out that inclu sion (3) is proper, i.e., RAND (t (n)) 3 for t (n) n 2 . <p> We next review the well-known notion of a martingale over a probability measure -. Computable martingales were used by Schnorr [17, 18, 19, 20] in his investigations of randomness, and have more recently been used by Lutz <ref> [14] </ref> in the development of resource-bounded measure. Definition. <p> In this sense, t (n)- genericity is much weaker then t (n)-randomness over the uniform probability measure. 3.3 Genericity and --Measure In order to discuss the implications of Theorem 3.3 for resource-bounded measure proofs, we briefly review the notions of resource-bounded measure and measure in complexity classes, developed by Lutz <ref> [14] </ref> over the uniform probability measure, and recently extended by Breutzmann and Lutz [9] to more general probability measures. The reader is referred to [15, 4, 9] for more complete discussions of this material. Definition. Let be a p-exact probability measure on C, and let X C. 1. <p> As usual, when the probability measure is not mentioned, it is assumed to be the uniform probability measure. For example, a set X has measure 0 in E if (XjE) = 0. Building on ideas from <ref> [14] </ref>, Breutzmann and Lutz [9] prove theorems justifying the intuition that a set with measure 0 in E contains only a negligibly small part of E (with respect to -), and similarly for E 2 . <p> The significance of Theorem 3.3 for resource-bounded measure lies in the following result on the abundance of random languages in E and E 2 . (This result generalizes results for the uniform probability measure presented by Lutz <ref> [14] </ref> and Ambos-Spies, Terwijn, and Zheng [7]; see also [4].) Theorem 3.5. Let be a positive probability measure on C. 1. If is p-exact, then for all k 2 N -(RAND - (n k )jE) = 1: 2.

Recently, Ambos-Spies, Neis, and Terwijn [6] have observed that the notion of time-bounded genericity developed by Ambos-Spies, Fleischhack, and Huwig [3] interacts informatively with resource-bounded measure. <p> The reader is referred to <ref> [15, 4, 9] </ref> for more complete discussions of this material. Definition. Let be a p-exact probability measure on C, and let X C. 1. X has p-measure 0, and we write -p (X) = 0, if there is a p-exact --martingale d that succeeds on every element of X. 2.
