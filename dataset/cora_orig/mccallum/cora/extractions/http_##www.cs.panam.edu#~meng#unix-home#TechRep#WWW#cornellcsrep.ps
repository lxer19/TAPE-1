Abstract: The goal of drop-in publishing is to simplify digital publishing over the Internet. We would like digital publishing of non-commercial matter (e.g. technical reports, course notes, brochures) be as easy as sending email is now, but with the virtues of archival storage and easy searching that we associate with electronic libraries. We propose a protocol, Dienst, to allow communication between clients and document servers by encoding object-oriented messages within URL's. A preliminary version of this protocol now runs at eight sites, and we describe some of its features. Next we present tools for automating the maintenance of document collections. Finally, we discuss the problems we've had with the Web as it stands, hoping to motivate changes that would improve performance of digital library systems such as ours. Desiderius Erasmus wrote these words in praise of his friend Aldus, a book publisher of the 16th century. More than 400 years later, digital publishing may finally enable us to fulfill this vision, providing universal access to all the world's information. What's in the way? The existing technologies (WWW, gopher, and even anonymous FTP) make reproduction and transmission fairly fast and cheap, but do little or nothing to help writers write or readers find or read documents. In our view, the problem is that they provide too little structure to the document collection. All of them present basically the same abstraction, namely a hierarchy of files, but do nothing to help the user locate a file within a hierarchy. Every site is different. Some group reports by year, others by project name; but even if every site on the Internet organized its hierarchy identically, it would not be enough, because every site also has its own conventions for naming files, indicating data formats, and making searchable indices. A writer who wishes to contribute has basically the same problem - it's easy to copy a file into an anonymous FTP area, but hard to make sure that it's indexed properly. A considerate writer might want to provide the same document in several formats, to increase the chances of accessibility, but this is a nuisance. We claim what's needed is a new, higher level protocol that hides the underlying details, and the underlying tools to simply library management. This paper presents our first steps towards the universal library. We describe a protocol for universal access and the server that implements it. (For those familiar with our server - in this paper we describe not the currently running protocol, but rather the one we have submitted as an Internet Draft [DIENSTPROT] , which corrects a number of design flaws in the working version. We regret any
