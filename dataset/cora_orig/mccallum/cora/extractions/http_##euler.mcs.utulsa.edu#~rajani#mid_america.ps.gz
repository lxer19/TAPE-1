Abstract: We are interested in developing intelligent agent applications where agents are autonomous and must be able to adapt to changing requirements and/or environmental demands. In particular, we are interested in multiagent systems, or agent groups which must cooperatively decide on job assignments that will maximize the productivity of the group. To evaluate our proposed group adaptation mechanisms, we have initially chosen a simulated robotic soccer domain for experimentation. We have developed a Soccer simulator in Java, which allows us to evaluate agent behavioral strategies for effectively collaborating with other team members while countering threats posed by the opposing team. We believe that Java is an excellent language for building intelligent agent applications. We will describe both the work completed and the system components under construction.

Reference-contexts: To be more precise, agents are often required to work together in a team cohesively such that they can compete effectively against other teams. We are interested in distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) systems <ref> (Bond & Gasser 1988) </ref>, which consist of autonomous intelligent agents inhabiting a world with little or no global control or globally consistent knowledge. Every agent needs some information from other agents in order to achieve its goal. Agents may be cooperative or selfish (Sekaran & Sen 1994).

Reference-contexts: Agents have to deal with the environmental uncertainity because their actions are not deterministic in nature. Decker discusses the role of simulators as testbeds in DAI research and provides a review of some of the most commonly used simulators in the area <ref> (Decker 1994) </ref>. These simulators have proved to be valuable tools for formulating, evaluating, enhancing, and proving the usefulness of different agent coordination paradigms. Our soccer simulator has the advantage of being continuous space, and allows experimentation with both cooperative and competitive agents.

Reference-contexts: Because the simulator is written in Java, it is easily portable, and a test version of it can be accessed over the internet (URL: http://euler.mcs.utulsa.edu/ arora/soccer.html ). Simulator Design The soccer simulator is a discrete event simulator <ref> (Fishman 1978) </ref>. It consists of three modules: soccer applet, simulator and player. The architecture of soccer simulator is depicted in Figure 1. The design approach adapted for this application is object-oriented. Each player is associated with a set of skills and behaviors.

Reference-contexts: This module includes process required to create and update the graphical interface of this game. The effects of the actions chosen by the player are depicted in the graphical interface. Figure 2 depicts the snapshot of soccer applet. Why Java ? Java is a simple object-oriented programming language <ref> (Flanagan 1996) </ref>. The object-oriented nature of Java enables programmers to write robust, extendible and reusable software. Exception handling feature of Java enables writing of more robust programs. Java is a secure language. Java implements several security mechanisms to protect the software against code that might try to create virus.

Reference-contexts: To study agent learning in a group as well as negotiation schemes to arrive at consensus we chose robotic soccer as our test domain. Though our choice of the robotic software domain was motivated in part by the Robot World Cup Initiative <ref> (Kitano et al. 1995) </ref>, we have decided to build our own soccer simulator because our goal is to use this simulator as a testbed to study several key, often closely related, issues in the design of agent systems.

Reference-contexts: Agents may be cooperative or selfish (Sekaran & Sen 1994). Coordination of problem solvers is a key issue in the design of a successful DAI system. Effective mechanisms have to be provided so that agents with conflicting interests can coordinate their actions. Agents should have certain necessary characteristics <ref> (Russell & Norvig 1995) </ref>. They should be able to monitor the performance of themselves and behavior of other agents in the system. Agents have to share information as and when necessary. Information sharing can be expedited by pre-established protocols. <p> tackling player with ball else if (I am goalkeeper) Guard goal else Guard nearest opponent Agent Behavior Some of the desirable capabilities of agents include monitoring the performance of themselves and behavior of other agents in the system as well as sharing information with other agents as and when necessary <ref> (Russell & Norvig 1995) </ref>. The soccer simulator allows us to explore and evaluate a number of strategies concerning various dimensions of agent behaviors. implementation of soccer agents. We also intend to use the simulator to study individual and collective learning by agents.

Reference-contexts: Information sharing can be expedited by pre-established protocols. This can also be triggered by opportunities or calamities as experienced on-line. When a group of agents with different knowledge and interests must come to a common decision or agreement, there is a need for a negotiation mechanism. For example, Sycara <ref> (Sycara 1988) </ref> states that: : : : the negotiation process involves identifying potential interaction either through communication or by reasoning about the current states and intentions of agents in the system and modifying the intentions of these agents to avoid harmful inter action or create cooperative situations.
