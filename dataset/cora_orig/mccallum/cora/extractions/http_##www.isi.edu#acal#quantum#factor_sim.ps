Title: Simulating the Effect of Decoherence and Inaccuracies on a Quantum Computer  
Author: Kevin M. Obenland and Alvin M. Despain 
Keyword: Quantum Simulation, Ion Trap, Factoring, Database Search  
Affiliation: Information Sciences Institute  
Abstract: A Quantum Computer is a new type of computer which can solve problems such as factoring and database search very efficiently. The usefulness of a quantum computer is limited by the effect of two different types of errors, decoherence and inaccuracies. In this paper we show the results of simulations of a quantum computer which consider both decoherence and inaccuracies. We simulate circuits which factor the numbers 15, 21, 35, and 57 as well as circuits which use database search to solve the circuit satisfaction problem. Our simulations show that the error rate per gate is on the order of 10 6 for a trapped ion quantum computer whose noise is kept below =4096 per gate and with a decoherence rate of 10 6 . This is an important bound because previous studies have shown that a quantum computer can factor more efficiently than a classical computer if the error rate is of order 10 6 .

Reference-contexts: The figures show the probability of finding a correct key for twelve iterations of the algorithm. When running the database search it is important to stop after the correct iteration, because the probability decreases if we run too many iterations <ref> [BoBr96] </ref>. For our case the highest probability occurs after the eighth iteration. Fig. 2.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we show results of simulations of a quantum computer which is subject to both decoherence and inaccuracies. These simulations assume the trapped ion model of a quantum computer proposed by Cirac and Zoller <ref> [CiZo95] </ref>. We study Shor's factorization algorithm by simulating circuits which factor the numbers 15, 21, 35, and 57 [Shor94]. We also simulate Grover's database search algorithm with a circuit which solves the circuit satisfaction problem [Grov96]. <p> the control bit unchanged, but conditionally flips the resultant bit based on the value of the control bit. 1.3 The Ion Trap Quantum Computer The ion trap quantum computer as proposed by Cirac and Zoller is one of the most promising schemes for the experimental realization of a quantum computer <ref> [CiZo95] </ref>. Several experiments have demonstrated simple quantum gates [MoMe95] [WiMM96]. Laser pulses directed at the ions in the trap cause transformations to their internal state. A common phonon vibration mode is used to communicate between the ions in the trap. A controlled-not gate is a sequence of laser pulses.

Reference-contexts: The quantum factoring circuit also contains operations to create the superposition state at the beginning of the circuit, and extract the period at the end of the circuit.

Grover's database search algorithm searches for a key, from a set of matching keys, in an unsorted database [Grov96]. The keys are defined by a function which can be evaluated in unit time.

Reference-contexts: A qubit is like a classical bit in that it can be in two states, zero or one. The qubit differs from the classical bit in that, because of the properties of quantum mechanics, it can be in both these states simultaneously <ref> [FeLS65] </ref>. A qubit which contains both the zero and one values is said to be in the superposition of the zero and one states. The superposition state persists until we perform an external measurement. This measurement operation forces the state to one of the two values. <p> The bit values of a state are encoded as the index of that state in the vector. The simulator represents each encoded bit string with a non zero amplitude in the state vector. The probability of each state is defined as the square of this complex amplitude <ref> [FeLS65] </ref>. For a register with M qubits, the simulator uses a vector space of dimension 2 M . 1.2 Quantum Transformations and Logic Gates A quantum computation is a sequence of transformations performed on the qubits contained in quantum registers [Feyn85][BaBe95].

The rest of this section gives a brief overview of quantum computers. 1.1 Qubits and Quantum Superposition The basic unit of storage in a Quantum Computer is the qubit. A qubit is like a classical bit in that it can be in two states, zero or one. <p> The circuit to calculate f (A) can be performed in O (L 3 ) time using repeated squaring [Desp96], i.e. a sequence of multiplications performed modulo N .

Reference-contexts: To get a single simulation point we run at least four simulations, and in many cases we run more to establish upper and lower confidence intervals for the average of the ending fidelities <ref> [HiMo80] </ref>. For simulations which include errors in the angle we run enough simulations so that the average of the fidelities is within 0.02 of the actual mean of the distribution with an upper and lower confidence of 95%.

Reference-contexts: Several experiments have demonstrated simple quantum gates <ref> [MoMe95] </ref> [WiMM96]. Laser pulses directed at the ions in the trap cause transformations to their internal state. A common phonon vibration mode is used to communicate between the ions in the trap. A controlled-not gate is a sequence of laser pulses. <p> Because the phonon mode is coupled to all the qubits in the computer, it is the largest source of decoherence <ref> [MoMe95] </ref>. For this reason we only model the phonon decoherence and not the decoherence of the individual qubits. We model the decoherence of the phonon mode by performing an additional operation after each laser pulse. <p> The dec parameter is simply the switching speed divided by the decoher-ence time. Recent experiments show switching speeds of 20kHz for a controlled-not gate, i.e. four pulses, and a decoherence rate of a few kHz <ref> [MoMe95] </ref>. This corresponds to a decoherence parameter value between 10 2 and 10 3 . 2.2 Quantum Circuits Much of the current interest in quantum computation is due to the discovery of an efficient algorithm by Peter Shor to factor numbers [Shor94].

Reference-contexts: In this paper we use a simplified model which, instead of using a third state for each qubit, uses a single third state which is shared amongst all the qubits. This simplified model reduces the simulation complexity exponentially without an appreciable loss of accuracy <ref> [ObDe97a] </ref>. Transformations in the Ion Trap. An operation in the ion trap quantum computer is a sequence of laser pulses. Each laser pulse is defined by one of the transformation matrices shown in equation 1. corresponds to the duration of the laser pulse and corresponds to the phase. <p> We have shown however that both methods for modeling decoherence give essentially the same results <ref> [ObDe97a] </ref>. Because the simulator applies the decoherence transformation once per laser pulse, the parameter dec has units of (decoherence/laser pulse). To convert these units to decoherence per unit time we must consider the switching time of the laser. <p> Standard deviation errors produce a more significant effect than errors of the same magnitude. This is due to a cancellation effect for mean errors which is very similar to the cancellation effect exhibited by errors <ref> [ObDe97a] </ref>. This cancellation effect occurs because of the nature of reversible computation and causes the fidelity to go through periods where it increases. Because we perform operations in pairs, where the two operations are inverses of each other, an Fig. 3.

Reference-contexts: Table 3 shows the error rate per gate considering decoherence and operational errors for the factor57 benchmark. Error rates for the other factoring benchmarks as well as error rates for the combination of decoherence and operational errors are given in <ref> [ObDe97b] </ref>. The error rate is calculated as (1 - Fidelity)/Number of Gates. To get the error rate for a particular amount of error, we calculate the error rate after every tenth gate in a computation and take the average.

Reference-contexts: To show the complexity of simulating these benchmarks we show the simulation time for each. This time assumes a single 300 MHz processor and the simulations include only operational error. All the factoring benchmarks were run using a parallel version of the simulator <ref> [ObDe98] </ref>. We have run simulations on as many as 256 processors, and the simulator achieves near linear speedup. Table 1.

Reference-contexts: It takes five laser pulses on average to implement each gate. To perform a computation of arbitrary length the error rate must be about 10 5 for one and two bit gates and 10 3 for three bit gates <ref> [Pres96] </ref>. An error rate of 10 5 corresponds to operational errors with = =2048 and decoherence of 10 5 . Table 3 shows that we can tolerate an even higher level of constant magnitude errors. The error rate is 10 5 for operational errors with = =1024.

Reference-contexts: This quantum parallelism is only applicable in a limited domain. Prime factorization is one such problem which can make effective use of quantum parallelism [Shor94]. This is an important problem because the security of the RSA public-key cryptosystem relies on the fact that prime factorization is computationally difficult <ref> [RiSA78] </ref>. Errors limit the effectiveness of any physical realization of a quantum computer. A quantum computer is subject to two different types of errors, decoher-ence and inaccuracies. Decoherence occurs when a quantum computer interacts with the environment.

Reference-contexts: Performing computation using these quantum particles results in an exponential amount of calculation in a polynomial amount of space and time [Feyn85][Deut85].

Shor suggest using 2L + 1 bits for an L bit factorization, but for the numbers used in our studies we can use less. For the factor15 problem the period is a power of two, i.e. four, and therefore there is no round off error.

Reference-contexts: If quantum computers are to be useful, we must be able to perform calculations which are even larger than the ones considered here. These larger calculations will therefore require the use of quantum error correcting codes <ref> [Stea96] </ref>. Several recent studies have shown that, by using fault tolerant techniques, if the error of an individual gate is low enough we can perform a useful quantum calculation of indefinite length [Pres96][KnLZ96]. This accuracy threshold is expressed in terms of the probability of error per gate.
