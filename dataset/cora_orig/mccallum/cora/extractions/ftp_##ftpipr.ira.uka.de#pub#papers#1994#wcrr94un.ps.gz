Reference-contexts: In parallel, the planning cycle of the mobile manipulation motion planner starts to compute motion commands for the platform to obtain the desired support for the manipulators. Knowledge about the requirements during the motion (e.g. minimizing joint torques) or at the goal position (e.g. maximum manipulability <ref> [1] </ref>) can be used to select an appropriate cost function. This cost function is used for the local planning scheme that is working in the configuration space model. A gradient in a potential field established by the selected cost function is used as a local decision for the platform motion. <p> . (2) A widespread approach for decomposing the end-effector motion is to use a pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian of the whole mobile manipulator: q = q p + x + (I - J J)k , (3) where J + T T -1 is the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of the Jacobian <ref> [1] </ref> and J . is the mobile manipulator Jacobian from Eqn. (2). The last term is related to the internal motion of the system, which has no effect on the position or orientation of the end-effector.

Reference-contexts: Researchers investigating control systems with redundant kinematics mainly consider manipulators with more than six degrees of freedom (DoF)[1],[2]. On the other hand, path planning approaches for mobile manipulators have been developed, in which the manipulators are considered fixed during the motion <ref> [3] </ref>. In the following, articles considering manipulators and a mobile platform as an integrated system are listed: in [4] a method is introduced that allows a mobile manipulator system to exert a definite force on a moving object, e.g., to transport it in cooperation with other robots.

Reference-contexts: The results presented in that paper were obtained with one manipulator with six DoF and a mobile platform with three DoF and non-holonomic constraints. In <ref> [5] </ref> the focus is on the control of the center of gravity to avoid the tumbling of the mobile manipulator.

Reference-contexts: The goal is to get the manipulator in such a configuration that a subsequent assembly task can be performed without delay. The inertial properties of holonomic mobile manipulation systems and strategies for their coordination and control are the focus of <ref> [8] </ref>. Based on the operational space formulation a model for the robot dynamics is being developed. The mobile base is viewed as a "macro-mechanism" whereas the arm is a fast and accurate "mini"-device.

Reference-contexts: The key idea is the notion of kinematic consistency that allows the generation of control torques, that do not change the dynamic properties of the mini device. Accurate position control of a manipulator subject to inaccuracies introduced by the suspension of the mobile platform is dealt with in <ref> [9] </ref>. The dynamic properties of the manipulator as well as the dynamic properties of the mobile platform are taken into account. The experimental results that could be obtained with this control scheme are presented in [10]. A similar problem is investigated in [11].

Reference-contexts: By means of a cost functional one of the variety of solutions resulting from the redundancy is chosen. A similar problem is dealt with in <ref> [13] </ref>. For two successive manipulation tasks, a configuration of the mobile base and manipulator has to be determined that complies with the requirements of both tasks and allows an optimal transition. The question of connecting these configurations by a trajectory has not yet been considered. <p> The scheme introduced here resolves redundancy in an implicit manner. 4.1 OUTLINE OF THE SCHEME In contrast to many researchers who perform offline decomposition of the TCP motion to obtain globally optimized trajectories [12][14], in this approach, a global optimization is merely established for the goal configuration <ref> [13] </ref>, while the WCRR 94, Proceedings of the Fifth World Conference on Robotics Research, September 27-29, 1994, Cambridge Massachusetts motion is decomposed online. The loss of optimality during motion is more than compensated by the gain in flexibility. This flexibility allows dynamic obstacles to be considered.

Reference-contexts: The resulting trajectory in augmented coordinates is used to generate motion commands for the mobile platform and the manipulator system. This approach was implemented for a real system with nine DoF and has been extended in <ref> [15] </ref> to allow for sensory-based trajectory tracking. In [16] a control method is introduced, that is executable in real-time because of its efficiency. The redundant DoF introduced by the mobile platform are treated as additional joints of the manipulator.

Reference-contexts: One main difference to the scheme in section 2.1 is the presence of kinematic redundancy during the whole motion and not only for discrete times. There are two different approaches to the resolving of kinematic redundancy for completely cooperating systems <ref> [17] </ref>: the first one is path inversion, where the complete end-effector trajectory is a priori known and transformed into joint motions by an offline optimization procedure. Since this scheme is not appropriate for sensor-controlled manipulation tasks, another method used is local inversion.
