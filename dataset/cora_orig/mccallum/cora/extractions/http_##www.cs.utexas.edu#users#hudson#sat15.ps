Title: Satisfiability Planning with Causal Theories  
Author: Norman McCain and Hudson Turner 
Address: Austin  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Sciences University of Texas at  
Abstract: A previous paper introduced the nonmono-tonic formalism of causal theories, along with a general method for representing action domains in it. Here we show that causal action theories provide a basis for effective automated planning. To this end, we define several properties plans may have, such as executability, determinism, and validity. We then identify a class of causal action theories for which (i) there is a concise translation into classical logic, and (ii) the models of the resulting classical theories correspond to valid plans. These results enable satisfi-ability planning (in the sense of Kautz and Selman) on the basis of action formalizations that include indirect effects of actions (ramifications), implied action preconditions (qualifications), concurrent actions, and other features of action domains. Causal theories representing the large blocks world and logistics planning problems from [Kautz and Sel-man, 1996] are solved comparatively quickly, demonstrating the effectiveness of our ap proach.

In this second case, a satisfying interpretation does not include an action history. Rather it provides, as it were, a refinement of the planning problem.

Reference-contexts: The other literals appear due to "standard schemas" (4)-(9).

In this domain there is a pendulum. In the course of nature (i.e., in the absence of interventions), the pendulum bob swings back and forth from right to left.

Reference-contexts: The formalism was introduced in [McCain and Turner, 1997], along with a general method for representing action domains as causal theories.

This approach to planning is noteworthy for two reasons.

Reference-contexts: Simple causal theories are very expressive, thus enabling planning with respect to a wide variety of action domains. We also provide experimental evidence that this planning approach can be very effective on classical problems, by solving, comparatively quickly, the large blocks worlds and logistics planning problems from <ref> [Kautz and Selman, 1996] </ref>. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the syntax and semantics of causal theories, and defines a concise translation from definite causal theories into classical logic. Section 3 illustrates our method of formalizing action domains in causal theories. <p> The procedure plan/0 reads in an initial state description S 0 and a time-specific goal G, converts them to clausal form, and adds them to the clause set obtained from the domain description. 3 The resulting clause set is simplified, as in <ref> [Kautz and Selman, 1996] </ref> 4 , and submitted to the satisfiablity checker rel sat [Bayardo and Schrag, 1997]. If lcomp (D) [ S 0 [ fGg is satisfiable, rel sat finds a satisfying interpretation and plan/0 displays it, answering "yes." The plan P can be read off from this display. <p> h (right,4). |: 0. right Actions: hold 1. right Actions: 2. -right Actions: hold 3. -right Actions: 4. right Elapsed Time (cpu sec): 0.01 yes 7 LARGE PLANNING PROBLEMS Here we report on the performance of our approach when applied to the large blocks world and logistics planning problems from <ref> [Kautz and Selman, 1996] </ref>.

We describe an implemented satisfiability planning system based on these ideas, and provide experimental evidence that the approach can be computationally effective, by solving hard classical planning instances from <ref> [Kautz and Selman, 1996] </ref> comparatively quickly. These developments are particularly noteworthy because of the expressive potential of simple causal theories, as illustrated by the Dominos and Pendulum domains presented in this paper.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION The language of causal theories is a simple nonmono-tonic formalism, intended for representing the conditions under which facts are caused. The formalism was introduced in <ref> [McCain and Turner, 1997] </ref>, along with a general method for representing action domains as causal theories. In the current paper, we describe an implemented approach to satisfiability planning [Kautz and Selman, 1992, 1996], which is based on a translation from the "definite" subclass of causal theories into classical propositional logic. <p> Let D be a causal theory. An interpretation I is causally explained according to D if I is the unique model of D I . As discussed in <ref> [McCain and Turner, 1997] </ref>, this definition reflects a principle of "universal causation": every literal that is true in a causally explained interpretation I according to D is required to be caused in I according to D. <p> Intuitively, when D describes an action domain, the interpretations that are causally explained according to D correspond to the world histories that are causally possible according to D. For a more helpful introduction to the causal theories formalism, see <ref> [McCain and Turner, 1997] </ref>. 2.3 LITERAL COMPLETION A causal theory D is definite if * the consequent of each causal law in D is either a literal or False, and * every literal is the consequent of finitely many causal laws in D. <p> ; :q ) :q ; q ) False : Causal theory D 1 is definite, and lcomp (D 1 ) is f p p _ :q ; :p False ; q q ; :q :q ; :q g : The following proposition generalizes slightly a result presented without proof in <ref> [McCain and Turner, 1997] </ref>. Proposition 1 An intepretation I is causally explained according to a definite causal theory D if and only if I is a model of lcomp (D). Proof. Assume I = D I .
