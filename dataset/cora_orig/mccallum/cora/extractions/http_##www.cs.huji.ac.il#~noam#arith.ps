Title: Lower Bounds on Arithmetic Circuits via Partial Derivatives (Preliminary Version)  
Author: Noam Nisan Avi Wigderson 
Date: April 26, 1995  
Abstract: In this paper we describe a new technique for obtaining lower bounds on restriced classes of nonmonotone arithmetic circuits. The heart of this technique is a complexity measure for multivariate polynomials, based on the linear span of their partial derivatives. fl Institute of Computer Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.

Reference-contexts: Ben-Or has shown that general circuits of unbounded fanin and depth 3 can compute all symmetric polynomials in polynomial size. 2 Conjecture: Homogeneous circuits require (log n log d) depth to compute the d'th ele-mentary symmetric polynomial. Only very weak lower bounds are known even for homogeneous circuits. In <ref> [1] </ref> exponential lower bounds are proven for computing the determinant by homogeneous circuits of unbounded fanin and depth 3. We can obtain, using our techniques, similar lower bounds for the easier problem of multiplying d n fi n matrices, for which the techniques of [1] do not apply. <p> In <ref> [1] </ref> exponential lower bounds are proven for computing the determinant by homogeneous circuits of unbounded fanin and depth 3. We can obtain, using our techniques, similar lower bounds for the easier problem of multiplying d n fi n matrices, for which the techniques of [1] do not apply. Theorem 1: Any homogeneous depth 3 circuit for multiplying d n fi n matrices requires (n d =d!) size. We know of no better lower bounds. <p> While pure circuits can certainly compute all multilinear functions, we do not know of any general simulation of general circuits by pure circuits. The techniques of <ref> [1] </ref> can be extended to give an (n) lower bound for computing the determinant by pure circuits, but these techniques cannot give any lower bounds for iterated matrix multiplication.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Despite much effort there are still essentially no lower bounds known for general models of computation such as boolean circuits. This sad state of affairs is essentially also true for arithmetic circuits, a natural model for computing arithmetic functions (see e.g. <ref> [2] </ref>). To date the best lower bounds known for arithmetic circuit size are only slightly super-linear ((n log n)), and no non-trivial lower bounds are known for arithmetic circuit depth.

Reference-contexts: We say that a circuit is homogeneous if all its nodes compute homogeneous functions. It is implicit in [5] (see <ref> [3] </ref>) that circuits for homogeneous functions can be made homogeneous with only a polynomials cost in size. However, it turns out that in this construction the depth grows by O (log d).

Reference-contexts: We consider both bounded-fanin circuits, and unbounded fanin ones. For a function f of degree d on N variables it is easy to prove an (log N + log d) lower bound for depth for bounded fanin circuits. Moreover it is known <ref> [4] </ref> that if f can be computed by polynomial size circuits then an upper bound for depth is O (log n log d). We ask whether a simliar lower bound can be proven. Essentially no depth lower bounds are known for general circuits.

Reference-contexts: This problem has polynomial size arithmetic circuits of depth O (log n log d), where the matrices are multiplied in a binary tree of matrix-matrix products. The standard conjecture is that this depth is optimal. For monotone arithmetic circuits such a lower bound is well known <ref> [6] </ref> (see also [7]). In this paper we attempt to prove depth lower bounds for this problem for non-monotone circuits. While we do exhibit a new technique for obtaining lower bounds on arithmetic circuit depth, this technique does not enable us to prove a general lower bound.

First, let hai denote the largest even integer not exceeding a (i.e. (hai = 2ba=2c). For any f 2 P T denote (f ) = dim (f )=n hjT ji . <p> We thus get for free what we used random restrictions for in the previous section. We make use of that in the main technical lemma below. Note the similarity to the argument used for monotone lower bounds by Tiwari and Tompa <ref> [7] </ref>. Lemma 9 Let d be an odd integer, and f be a multilinear polynomial (of degree d) over X 1 ; ; X d . Then D O (f) = (log n log k + log (f)) Proof: Assume we are given a clean circuit C for f .
