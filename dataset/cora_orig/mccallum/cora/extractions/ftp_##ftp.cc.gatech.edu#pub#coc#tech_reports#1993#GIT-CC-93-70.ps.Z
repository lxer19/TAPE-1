Abstract: This paper presents two randomized protocols for the problem of electing a "leader" among a set of nodes in an arbitrary multi-hop radio network. First, a variation of the leader election protocol by Bar-Yehuda et al. [BGI87] is presented, in which the termination problem is addressed. Then, an efficient randomized leader election protocol in arbitrary multi-hop radio networks is presented. Our election protocol is shown both analytically and experimentally to be asymptotically more efficient than previously known leader election protocols for (almost) all networks. Also, the protocol is much simpler than previously known leader election protocols.

In the protocol, it is assumed that each node starts the election protocol simultaneously. Time is divided into intervals, called broadcast phases, each of which consists of BT timeslots.

Reference-contexts: There is a situation, involving arbitrary radio networks, in which we might want to select some distinguished node in a network. A good example is in spanning tree protocols, where we might want to designate a "root" node from which we can originate the tree <ref> [BII89] </ref>. The leader election problem has been studied in radio networks [BGI87, BGI91, Hof87]. Bar-Yehuda et al.

The termination detection problem of their protocol is not resolved clearly (to be explained in Section 3).

We conjecture that the above leader election protocol elects a node as a leader with very high probability.

Reference-contexts: Note that a passive node never initiates a message. Therefore, about half of the nodes are eliminated after a broadcast phase on the average with high probability. During a broadcast phase, each node executes a single-source broadcast protocol. The broadcast protocol can be any of the protocols presented in <ref> [LBA93] </ref>. Note that initiators do not wait for a message from another node before the execution of the broadcast protocol. <p> Thus, the protocol elects a node with the maximum ID value as a leader at termination. Nodes can be Active or Passive. An active node is one that is in the process of forwarding a message to its neighbors using a suitable modification of a single-source broadcast protocol in <ref> [LBA93] </ref>, SS Protocol 3. The modification, called LE Protocol 3 1 , aborts as soon as a node running it realizes that a new message with larger ID has been received and resumes by forwarding the new message.
