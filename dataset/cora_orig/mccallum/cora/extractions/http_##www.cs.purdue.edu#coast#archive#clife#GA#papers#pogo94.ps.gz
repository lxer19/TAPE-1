Title: Walsh and Partition Functions Made Easy  
Author: Paul Field 
Address: Mile End Road London E1 4NS  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science Queen Mary and Westfield College  
Abstract: This paper introduces Walsh and partition functions, coefficients and transforms in a genetic algorithm context. This has been done before, but this paper takes a light and basically non-mathematical approach to the subject. As well as describing the functions themselves, the paper deals with the idea of basis and what a change of basis means. The mathematics for all these concepts is presented, but the preceding nontechnical description should make its introduction relatively painless.
