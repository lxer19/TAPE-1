Abstract: A mesh of points outlining a surface is polyhedral if all cells are either quadrilateral or planar. A mesh is vertex-degree bounded, if at most four cells meet at every vertex. This paper shows that if a mesh has both properties then simple averaging of its points yields the Bernstein-Bezier coefficients of a smooth, at most cubic surface that consists of twice as many three-sided polynomial pieces as there are interior edges in the mesh. Meshes with checker board structure, i.e. rectilinear meshes are a special case and result in a quadratic surface. Since any mesh and, in particular any wireframe of a polyhedron can be refined, by averaging, to a vertex-degree bounded polyhedral mesh this result allows reinterpreting a number of algorithms that construct smooth surfaces and advertises the corresponding averaging formulas as a basis for a wider class of algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The analysis is made easy by the fact that the planar cells serve as tangent planes at user-specified points. Should the mesh additionally be regular, then the C 1 surface becomes the quadratic defined by these tangent planes, a four-direction box spline surface <ref> [1] </ref>.

[4]) of a C 1 surface that follows the outline of the input mesh. By default, a global surface boundary consists of the boundaries of the well-defined patches one removed from the global mesh boundary. <p> If all the coefficients P ijk;l are convex combinations of the mesh points then the surface lies in the convex hull of the polyhedral mesh. We see that the former is the case if ` 2 [1=3; 5=6] for n = 3 and ` 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for n = 4. If more is known about the structure of the mesh, the convex hull property can be established independent of ` (see the Remark below). It remains to prove the tangent plane continuity of the resulting surface. Theorem.

Reference-contexts: For more sophisticated use, a good strategy is to adaptively refine the object by averaging the vertices of its boundary representation as in the subdivision algorithms [3] and <ref> [2] </ref>. The purpose of this paper is to show that with comparable effort one can obtain the explicit polynomial representation of a smooth, namely tangent continuous, surface that follows the outlines of a mesh of points such as the vertices and edges of a polyhedron.

The purpose of this paper is to show that with comparable effort one can obtain the explicit polynomial representation of a smooth, namely tangent continuous, surface that follows the outlines of a mesh of points such as the vertices and edges of a polyhedron. <p> Smoothing these special meshes is of interest, because any surface mesh can be turned into a vertex-degree bounded, polyhedral mesh by refinement and projection. A typical example of a refinement that results in a vertex-degree bounded mesh is the application of a single step of the Doo-Sabin algorithm <ref> [3] </ref>. Here a new mesh point is created for each vertex of each cell; then each new point is connected to the two new points corresponding to the neighboring vertices of the same cell and to the two new points corresponding to the neighboring cells and the same vertex.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, each interior vertex has four neighbors at the end of the step. An example of a projection is the map P j 7! P P i =n + 2 cos (2 (i + j)=n)P i =n, for j = 1::n (cf. <ref> [6] </ref>) which maps n points P 1 ; : : : ; P n into a common plane. Both operations can be scaled such that the basic shape of the mesh and hence of the resulting surface is preserved [13].

Reference-contexts: For example, chopping off a high-degree vertex that is convex with regard to its neighbors bounds the vertex-degree and creates locally a polyhedral mesh by a purely local operation. There are also meshes to which the smoothing algorithm can be applied directly. Buckminsterfullerene geodesic structures found in nature <ref> [17] </ref> are naturally vertex-degree bounded polyhedral due to the valence and energy distribution of carbon based structures. This paper consists of the algorithm, its analysis and examples. The analysis is made easy by the fact that the planar cells serve as tangent planes at user-specified points.
