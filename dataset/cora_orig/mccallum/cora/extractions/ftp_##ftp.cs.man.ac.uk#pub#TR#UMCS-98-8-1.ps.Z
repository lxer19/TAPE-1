Reference-contexts: The resultant force prevents the moving object from colliding with obstacles while it moves towards its goal. Krogh [Kro86] extended Khatib's work by considering not only the distance but also the velocity of the moving object in calculating the potential field. Arkin's motor schema based navigation <ref> [Ark89] </ref> also used potential force field as the output of a schema to control the 8 movement of a mobile robot.

Reference-contexts: Collision detection is usually accompanied by strategies to simulate the response of objects involved in collisions. Collision response is generally application dependent, and many algorithms have been suggested for different environments like motion control in animation [MW88], physical simulations by Baraff <ref> [Bar92, Bar90] </ref>, Hahn [Hah88], Pentland and Williams [PW90], or molecular modelling by Turk [Tur89]. However, simulating the physical behaviour, or reaction, of objects due to collision is beyond the scope of the navigation method discussed here.

Reference-contexts: The approach presented in the thesis aimed at a further goal a guiding mechanism in a walk-through. 3.3 Force field approaches Our idea of using a force field around objects to help guide the user was motivated by the work of Bouvier and Guilloteau <ref> [BG96] </ref>, who used a flocking algorithm [Rey87] for simulation of crowd control in a virtual environment. However, in their paper, they used only normal collision detection mechanisms for preventing collisions with the environment. Force field approaches have been used previously for path planning in the robotics field.

Reference-contexts: Instead of passively responding to the environment or following a given path, the user's intention during the walk-through may be arbitrary and varying, so a different approach is needed. A similar idea is used in Borenstein and Koren's system <ref> [BK89] </ref> to achieve real-time obstacle avoidance for a mobile robot. Rather than use an analytical function to control the strength of an obstacle's repulsive force, they used the feedback from sensory instruments mounted on the robot to determine the increase of the force field.

Reference-contexts: To address this problem, some researchers use four dimensional analysis, where the simulation time is represented as the fourth dimension. One of the earliest examples of this idea is presented by Boyse <ref> [Boy79] </ref>. He derives simple equations for motion of polyhedral edges and faces over time.

Reference-contexts: These can be caused by unnatural interaction metaphors or by anything inconsistent with the user's everyday experience of the real world. Efforts have been made in developing new metaphors for walk-through in a virtual environment. Examples are Fairchild et al's leaning metaphor [FLLS93], Brooks' steerable treadmill <ref> [Bro92] </ref>, Imata and Matsuda's roller skates [IM92], and Slater and Usoh's walking-in-place metaphor [SUS95]. However, intuitive interaction metaphors are only able to solve part of the problem of walk-through. Another part of the problem is related to the properties of a virtual environment. <p> During a six year project, researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) <ref> [Bro92] </ref> have built a succession of six interactive graphics systems which enable a user to experience an architectural model by means of a VR walk-through.

Reference-contexts: However, the assumptions of the algorithm significantly limit its use in practice. Cameron <ref> [Cam85] </ref> describes several methods for clash detection for polyhedra. One of the methods uses a space-time approach, which generates 4D objects from the original 3D objects by adding time as another dimension. Intersections are then detected between 4D objects.

Reference-contexts: Their systems also provide more natural interfaces to users. For instance, one can reach out a hand and open doors, pick up and carry certain objects, and move furniture around. More recently, they presented a collision detection library for large environments, named V-Collide <ref> [CGH + 97] </ref>. V-Collide is a successor of their I-COLLIDE software (an exact and interactive collision detection system), which will be discussed later. However no updated report on this work has been found which addresses the ability to effectively negotiate stairs.
