Title: Morphic Search Strategies  
Author: J Kingdon L Dekker 
Address: Gower Street London, UK  
Affiliation: Intelligent Systems Lab Department of Computer Science University College London  
Abstract: Also at SearchSpace Ltd., London. Abstract: This paper presents the details of a novel search strategy based on randomly remapped search spaces. The algorithm, the Multi-Morphic Hill Climber (MMHC), uses multiple base changes in the encoding of potential solutions, so as to adjust the shape and form of a search problem. We describe the algorithms structure and present the details of the algorithms results on the range of real-valued test functions as defined by the IEEE First International Contest on Evolutionary Optimisation. 1.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm is a member of a recently devised class of search methods that make use of dynamically and randomly remapped space during the course of a run. A series of such algorithms, including genetic algorithms and hill-climbers, was presented at GALESIA `95 <ref> [KiDe95] </ref>, along with their performance on a range of standard test functions. A full and detailed description of the approach is to be presented in a special issue of IEE Proceedings D Journal 1996. <p> Firstly, we employ random changes in the algorithm's representation, and secondly we use base changes to remap the space (a third aspect relates to representational changes used to reinforce spatial attributes within a genetic algorithm. For the full range of morphic algorithms see <ref> [KiDe95] </ref>.) Random representational changes are advocated on the grounds that once a search heuristic has halted there is no basis by which to infer what the new representation should be (i.e., the algorithm may have found the global optimum). <p> Thus representational changes are random rather than directed. For this paper we describe the MMHC. This employs multiple remaps of the search space via base changes, and has been found to produce good results on a number of standard test functions <ref> [KiDe95] </ref>. It also has the added advantage of having very few parameters. 3. Algorithm SpecificationMulti-Morphic Hill Climber In this section we provide the algorithmic details of the MMHC. An individual of the algorithm is a candidate solution in encoded form (or chromosome string). <p> The small number of parameters associated with MMHC is perhaps its most interesting aspect and should be welcomed. The results presented here and in <ref> [KiDe95] </ref> suggest that the MMHC is a useful algorithm, and may well be a good first choice when faced with an unknown search problem for which there is no a priori solution.
