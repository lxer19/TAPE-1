Abstract: User manipulation of assembly models can provide insight during the early, formulative design stages into kinematic and dynamic characteristics of a mechanism. We present the advantages of kinematic representation of constraint equations in fully Cartesian coordinates, a departure from standard practice for interactive mechanical assembly at interactive rates. Formulations of a surface rolling contact constraint equation and its Jacobian, defined as a joint between two NURBS surfaces via position, tangency and velocity constraint relations, are derived for use in dynamic simulation and assembly optimization. The constraint equation formulations use quaternions to represent orientation. An appendix develops appropriate differential algebra. In this work we develop the use of constraints in global frame Cartesian coordinates for describing operator-in-the-loop interactions with mechanical assemblies under a unified framework combining lower-pair joints and more general surface contact interactions.

Reference-contexts: We are concerned with the development of surface contact kinematics in coordinates of the position and orientation of each linkage. Commercial CAD packages are beginning to incorporate new features in geometric constraints such as edge-to-surface constraints [ProE], <ref> [Adams] </ref>, and modeling of mechanisms with surface constraints is becoming more advanced.

Reference-contexts: Other work has treated surface-surface contacts, or against surfaces in terms of a unilateral linear complementarity problem or as a quadratic programming problem [Lotstedt, 1982]. A direct method without optimization is given in <ref> [Baraff, 1994] </ref>. The nature of the dynamics problem treated here differs in that we are concerned with the geometry of smooth surface joints modeled as bilateral constraints which hold together, rather than unilateral constraints and friction forces of flat or polygonal surface contacts.

Reference-contexts: Reduced (joint-space) generalized coordinates may be used as an alternative, but this alternative is not applicable to joints with many degrees of freedom or joints with nonholonomic constraints that cannot be parameterized <ref> [Baraff, 1996] </ref>. The Newton-Euler equations and other well known dynamics formulations can be expressed in ACGC, and augmented with Lagrange multipliers to account for joint constraint forces [Haug, 1992],[Shabana, 1994]. <p> We have found this approach to have desirable characteristics in software engineering and expressiveness due to modular association of equations with bodies. Also, it is known to have linear cost in the number of constraints <ref> [Baraff, 1996] </ref>. This technique uses sparse constraint Jacobian matrices, that is, partial derivatives of geometric constraint expressions that enforce the requirement that joints remain connected. Lagrange multipliers can be used with the parameterization of complicated joints when the joint coordinates are ACGC. <p> The evolutionary style of updating the point and angle of contact by adding the parametric contact coordinates to the generalized coordinates is not conveniently used with the Cartesian coordinates in the La-grange multiplier constraints, formulated in [Shabana, 1994], [Haug, 1992], <ref> [Baraff, 1996] </ref> and this work. We are concerned with the development of surface contact kinematics in coordinates of the position and orientation of each linkage. <p> C T q l is the joint constraint force as shown in [Haug, 1992].

A user's hand grasping an object may be represented as the ground constraint in an assembly. <p> Those modes can cause frequent local minima but they are avoided with the use of quaternions. The use of geometric constraints with quaternion coordinates therefore reduces to applying forces somewhat like the methods in <ref> [Barr, 1988] </ref>. We have found experimentally that a choice of k=0.1 is a high but stable value for the examples encountered so far. This constant is a limit on how fast the assembly process converges to satisfaction.

Both links are also constrained by two revolute joints attached to ground, making it a 1 DOF planar mechanism. 10 Conclusion The approach advocated in this paper for constraint satisfaction, inverse kinematics, and similar assembly problems is the use of constraint equations and the Jacobian of constraint equations.

Reference-contexts: Some simple numerical analysis shows that a very small value of h relative to the coordinates magnitude may be selected in practice without resulting in loss of precision due to subtraction of very similar numbers. For the purposes of assembly optimization, the O (h) formula <ref> [Hansen, 1995] </ref>, S 1;2 = 1;2 1;2 h has occasionally been inadequate for optimization purposes. The O (h 2 ) method is used when the O (h) technique causes nonsensical results.

Other work has treated surface-surface contacts, or against surfaces in terms of a unilateral linear complementarity problem or as a quadratic programming problem <ref> [Lotstedt, 1982] </ref>. A direct method without optimization is given in [Baraff, 1994].

Reference-contexts: We are concerned with the development of surface contact kinematics in coordinates of the position and orientation of each linkage. Commercial CAD packages are beginning to incorporate new features in geometric constraints such as edge-to-surface constraints <ref> [ProE] </ref>, [Adams], and modeling of mechanisms with surface constraints is becoming more advanced.

Reference-contexts: It is then necessary to decide the form, or generalized coordinates with which to express these equations. Generalized coordinates are any set of coordinates used to describe system configuration; further, any quantity may serve as generalized coordinates [Goldstein, 1980], <ref> [Shabana, 1994] </ref>. The equations applicable to the above cited examples can be expressed in absolute Cartesian generalized coordinates, (ACGC) [Shabana, 1994]. <p> Generalized coordinates are any set of coordinates used to describe system configuration; further, any quantity may serve as generalized coordinates [Goldstein, 1980], <ref> [Shabana, 1994] </ref>. The equations applicable to the above cited examples can be expressed in absolute Cartesian generalized coordinates, (ACGC) [Shabana, 1994]. Reduced (joint-space) generalized coordinates may be used as an alternative, but this alternative is not applicable to joints with many degrees of freedom or joints with nonholonomic constraints that cannot be parameterized [Baraff, 1996]. <p> The evolutionary style of updating the point and angle of contact by adding the parametric contact coordinates to the generalized coordinates is not conveniently used with the Cartesian coordinates in the La-grange multiplier constraints, formulated in <ref> [Shabana, 1994] </ref>, [Haug, 1992], [Baraff, 1996] and this work. We are concerned with the development of surface contact kinematics in coordinates of the position and orientation of each linkage. <p> The surface constraints are written in the manner of lower-pair geometric joint constraints as found in [Yang, 1995], <ref> [Shabana, 1994] </ref>, [Haug, 1992]. For example, a spherical joint in Fig. 5 indicates that the endpoints of the two bodies i and j must meet. <p> The solution of the resulting system solves the generalized inverse kinematics problem which allows the user to move pieces of the assembly in an interactive way. A review of the formulation of simple constraints in Cartesian coordinates is contained in <ref> [Shabana, 1994] </ref>. Automatic assembly optimization for finding mechanical configurations satisfying joint constraints C (q) = 0, i.e. by New-ton's optimization method, C q Dq = C (q) (14) is useful in assembly analysis to eliminate the need to piece together assemblies by hand. <p> spring force be proportional to error (error is the constraint manifold C), we would have in general spring f orce = kC T q C When forming C and C q , the change in rotation of a vector with respect to the change in the coordinates q is used. <ref> [Shabana, 1994] </ref> derives such a term R (q 4::6 )v . Optimization methods for geometric satisfaction problems use of R (q)v can have difficulties in most configurations with local minima when Euler angles are used. To circumvent local minima problems, we use a quaternion 4-tuple to represent orientation. <p> 5 8 Motion Equation We couple the equations of motion and two time derivatives of the constraint equation C (q; t) = 0 as in C q q = C t M q + C T where Q e are external applied forces, and Q v are velocity dependent terms <ref> [Shabana, 1994] </ref>. C T q l is the joint constraint force as shown in [Haug, 1992]. The problem can be solved for q and l in linear time [Baraff, 1996]. <p> This is a performance advantage for haptics methods over quadratically converging, cubic cost algorithms [SDFast, 1990], [Garcia, 1994], <ref> [Shabana, 1994] </ref>, [Nahvi, 1998], [Lenarcic, 1998].
