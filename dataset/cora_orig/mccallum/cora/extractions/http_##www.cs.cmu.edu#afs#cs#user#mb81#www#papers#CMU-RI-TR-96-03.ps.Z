Abstract: The aeromedical evacuation application of the DITOPS Planning and Scheduling Framework described in this paper was supported by a research grant from Carnegie Group Inc. Development of the DITOPS framework itself was sponsored in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency and Rome Laboratory, Air Force Material Command, USAF, under grant numbers F30602-90-C-0119 and F30602-95-1-0018 as well as F30602-91-C-0014 (under subcontract to BBN Systems and Technologies), and the CMU Robotics Institute. The views and conclusions contained herein are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies or endorsements, either expressed or implied, of the Advanced Research Projects Agency and Rome Laboratory the U.S. Government, or Carnegie Group, Inc.

Reference-contexts: The documentation style mimics that of the book Common Lisp: the Language [6, in particular see section 1.2.5]. Due to the fact that the implementation uses an extension of CLOS called PORK <ref> [1] </ref>, the notation has been extended to include inverse relations, automatically updated pairs of slots (indicated with the $ symbol) used to implement 1-to-1, 1-to-many and many-to-many relations. patient [Class] :urgent [Initarg] :medical-specialty-required [Initarg] :real-name [Initarg] :prescribed-destination [Initarg] :hours-before-ron [Initarg] relations $ patients [Relation] mission-legs $ patients [Relation] This class inherits

Reference-contexts: This approach is analogous to modern application development frameworks which provide the basic functionality of a complex user-interface in the form of an application skeleton (e.g., <ref> [2] </ref>). In the case of DITOPS, the skeleton is an empty, generic constraint-based scheduling system. Solutions and classes defined in the framework will probably suit the majority of application needs. However, there is always the possibility to replace any component of the system with a different or more specialized component.
