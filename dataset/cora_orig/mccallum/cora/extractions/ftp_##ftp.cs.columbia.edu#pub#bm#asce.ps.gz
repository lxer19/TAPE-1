Title: 1 Webster et al Augmented Reality in Architectural Construction, Inspection, and Renovation  
Author: Anthony Webster, Steven Feiner, Blair MacIntyre, William Massie, Theodore Krueger 
Abstract: We present our preliminary work in developing augmented reality systems to improve methods for the construction, inspection, and renovation of architectural structures. Augmented reality systems add virtual computer-generated material to the surrounding physical world. Our augmented reality systems use see-through head-worn displays to overlay graphics and sounds on a person's naturally occurring vision and hearing. As the person moves about, the position and orientation of his or her head is tracked, allowing the overlaid material to remain tied to the physical world. We describe an experimental augmented reality system that shows the location of columns behind a finished wall, the location of rebars inside one of the columns, and a structural analysis of the column. We also discuss our preliminary work in developing an augmented reality system for improving the construction of spaceframes. Potential uses of more advanced augmented reality systems are presented.

Reference-contexts: The X11 bitmap is treated as if it were projected onto a portion of the surface of a virtual sphere surrounding the user and is composited with the bitmap containing the 3D graphics for presentation on the head-mounted display <ref> (Feiner et al., 1993) </ref>. Our augmented reality testbed allows an X11 window to be positioned so that a selected point on the window is fixed at an arbitrary position within the 3D world. <p> We refer to such windows as world-fixed windows to distinguish them from windows that are 4 Webster et al fixed to the display itself or to the body-tracked virtual sphere. Building on our work on knowledge-based augmented reality for maintenance and repair <ref> (Feiner, MacIntyre & Seligmann, 1993) </ref>, we are developing a knowledge-based system that will dynamically control which parts of the structural system are displayed to satisfy the users goals in exploring the environment. We are currently developing another augmented reality testbed system that addresses spaceframe construction.

Reference-contexts: The potential impact of augmented reality on architecture and structural engineering will increase as the technology is tied to other emerging technologies. For example, the addition of knowledge-based expert systems <ref> (Feiner & McKeown 1991, Myers 1992) </ref> to the core augmented reality technology described here could yield systems capable of training workers at actual construction sites while they work to assemble a real building. Such real-time at-site training systems could guide inexperienced users through complex construction operations.

Reference-contexts: These systems promise to improve the optimization of construction operations and to allow checks of constructability and maintainability before building materials are ordered (Virtual 1995, Oloufa 1993); integrated structural, architectural, and mechanical building databases are being combined with engineering expertise to create knowledge-based systems for improving the design process <ref> (Myers et. al. 1992) </ref>. Robotics systems, mostly adapted from the automotive industry, have also been used recently in experimental and commercial attempts to automate various aspects of building construction (Webster 1994, Richards 1994).

Reference-contexts: The testbed we are using for the spaceframe prototype is a multi-platform, distributed system that has been designed to allow a potentially large number of users to interact in a shared environment <ref> (MacIntyre 1995) </ref>. It runs on an assortment of hardware under UNIX, Windows NT, and Windows 95. The majority of the testbed was written in Modula-3, a compiled language that is wellsuited for building large distributed systems.

Reference-contexts: Introduction A variety of computer technologies and computer science techniques are now used by researchers aiming to improve aspects of architectural design, construction and maintenance. Virtual reality systems are used to envision modified cityscapes, and to assess the impact of proposed buildings <ref> (Novitski 1994) </ref>. Both virtual reality and conventional computer systems are currently used in demonstration testbeds to Associate Professor of Architecture, Graduate School of Architecture, Columbia University.
