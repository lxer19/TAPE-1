Abstract: This paper studies the effect of slow cyclic variation of parameters on the phase of the oscillating Morris-Lecar model. In chemical oscillators it is known that a phase shift, called the geometric phase shift, is observed upon return to an initial point in parameter space. We find geometric phase shifts for a two-parameter variation in the Morris-Lecar model. As with the chemical oscillator, the magnitude of the shift is proportional to the area enclosed by the path traced through the parameter space. It is argued that the geometric phase shift may subserve many biological functions. We conclude that the geometric phase shift may be functionally relevant for neural computation.

When the parameters of an oscillating dynamical system are adiabatically (slowly) varied to trace a closed path in parameter space, a phase shift is observed upon fl This is a DRAFT VERSION of a paper we intend to expand.

Recent experimental findings indicate that phase information is significant in neural computation involving oscillatory activity.
