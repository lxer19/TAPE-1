Abstract: Tech Report TR-93-00, Dept CS, Univ. Ottawa, Canada, (1993) To appear in journal: Fundamenta Informatica (1996) http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/pclark/papers/ccrs.ps.Z Abstract. Evidence for image classification can be considered to come from two sources: traditional statistical information derived algorithmically from image data, and model-based evidence arising from previous expertise and experience in a given application domain. This paper presents a study of classification techniques based on both these sources (traditional algorithmic and model-based), and illustrates how they can be combined. A prototype image classification system, called Cabaress, has been constructed which implements these methods. We evaluate Cabaress as applied to the problem of identifying crops in agricultural fields, based on classifying image segments extracted from radar image data. Our results demonstrate this mixed-method approach can achieve improved classificational accuracy.

Reference-contexts: A rule based approach was attempted in addition to the parametric classification approach, using the crop rotation rules generally practised by most farmers at the test sites. The result was found to be promising <ref> [1] </ref>. Following this direction, our goal in this research is to further improve image classification by using mixed-method classification techniques. <p> To compare/combine this style of image classification with other methods, we use a standard maximum likelihood classification (MLC) algorithm based on application of Bayes' rule. This approach has been used successfully in image classification (e.g. <ref> [1, 8] </ref>) and other classification tasks (eg. [9, 10, 11]).

Similarity Assessment: Identify cases in the case-base (i.e. a a set of previously encountered problems with known solutions) which are most similar to the new case (i.e. the current problem) to be solved. 2.

Reference-contexts: Additional information about the images and the field was also available (e.g. geographical location, standard deviations of the mean pixel intensities). However, an earlier study indicated that this extra information did not contribute significantly to classificational accuracy and so was not used in this experiment <ref> [16] </ref>. There are seven types of crops, resulting in seven mutually exclusive classes to predict. These are: wheat, barley, flax, fallow, canola, canary grass, and peas. 5.2 Experimental Method Experiments were conducted on each data set (1989, 1990) in turn.
