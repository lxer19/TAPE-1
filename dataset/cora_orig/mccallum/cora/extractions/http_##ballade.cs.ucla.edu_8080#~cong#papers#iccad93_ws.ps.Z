Abstract: In this paper, we study the optimal wiresizing problem under the distributed Elmore delay model. We show that the optimal wiresizing solutions satisfy a number of interesting properties, including the separability, the monotone property, and the dominance property. Based on these properties, we develop a polynomial-time optimal wiresizing algorithm for arbitrary interconnect structures under the distributed Elmore delay model. Extensive experimental results show that our wiresizing solution reduces interconnection delay by up to 51% when compared to the uniform-width solution of the same routing topology. Furthermore, compared to the wiresizing solution based on a simpler RC delay model in [7], our wiresizing solution reduces the total wiring area by up to 28% while further reducing the interconnection delays to the timing-critical sinks by up to 12%.

Reference-contexts: Experimental results showed that the algorithm in [7] can construct A-trees which are at most 4% within the optimal, and achieve interconnection delay reduction by as much as 66% when compared to the best-known Steiner routing topology. When the critical-path information is available, the critical sink routing approaches in <ref> [2] </ref> reduce the delays to specified sinks substantially. Although steady progress has been made in optimizing interconnect topology design for delay minimization, there were very few works on wiresizing optimization for high-performance interconnect designs. Wiresizing was used by Fisher and Kung [11] in H-tree clock routing.

In the remaining section, we shall use the multiple-critical-sink formulation in our wiresizing algorithms. 3 Properties of Optimal Wiresizing Solu tions In this section, we study several interesting properties of optimal wiresizing solutions, including the separability, the monotone property, and the dominance property. <p> These properties are very useful in the development of the optimal wiresizing algorithms in the next section. The complete proofs of these results can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>. 3.1 Separability Theorem 1 If the width assignment of the path from the source to a segment E is given, the optimal width assignment of each subtree branching from E can be carried out independently. <p> This tradeoff can be formulated as finding a wiresizing assignment W which minimizes a weighted sum of the delay and the total wiring area, i. e. ff delay + fi area, where ff and fi are constants. We have shown in <ref> [6] </ref> that this delay-area tradeoff formulation can be reduced to the general formulation in (9), and therefore can be handled by our wiresizing algorithms.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction As the VLSI fabrication technology reaches submicron device dimension and gigahertz frequency, interconnection delay has become the dominant factor in determining circuit speed [9, 14]. The analysis in [15] and <ref> [7] </ref> showed that in the conventional VLSI technology, interconnection delay is determined by the product of the driver resistance and the total wire capacitance. <p> Another cost-radius tradeoff was achieved in [1] with further improvement in performance [3].

When the critical-path information is available, the critical sink routing approaches in [2] reduce the delays to specified sinks substantially. <p> Although steady progress has been made in optimizing interconnect topology design for delay minimization, there were very few works on wiresizing optimization for high-performance interconnect designs. Wiresizing was used by Fisher and Kung [11] in H-tree clock routing. Recently, Cong, Leung, and Zhou <ref> [7] </ref> developed an optimal wiresizing algorithm based on minimizing an upper bound of the delay in a distributed RC tree proposed by Rubinstein, Penfield and Horowitz [13], which is given by: t = all nodes k R k c k (1) where R k is the path resistance between the source <p> This upper-bound delay model was chosen in <ref> [7] </ref> because it simplifies the wiresiz-ing optimization. However, the simplicity of this delay model also results in several drawbacks. First, it provides only an upper bound of the worst-case RC delay in the routing tree and does not distinguish the delays at different sinks. <p> The separability, the monotone property, and the dominance property were shown to be true for the optimal wiresizing solution under the upper-bound delay model in <ref> [7] </ref>. The results in this section show that these three properties are also true for the more complicated distributed Elmore delay model. <p> based on the 2m CMOS process provided by the Orbit Semiconductor Foresight program, and the MCM technology parameters were obtained from [8]. 5.1 Comparisons Between Different Wiresiz ing Solutions We have compared our FOWSA/ED wiresizing solutions with the wiresizing solutions by OWSA based on the upper-bound RC delay model in <ref> [7] </ref>, as well as the minimum-width solution (MIN) and the maximum-width solution (MAX). In this set of experiment, the set of wire widths allowed is fW 1 ; 2W 1 ; 3W 1 ; 4W 1 g, where W 1 is the minimum width. <p> The normalized wiring areas for MIN and MAX are 1.0000 and 4.0000 respectively. for a typical Steiner routing tree under the MCM technology. The width assignments of the trees are obtained by the following ways: (a) using the minimum width; (b) by OWSA based on the RC delay model <ref> [7] </ref>; (c) by FOWSA/ED with a single critical sink X; (d) by FOWSA/ED with a single critical sink Y; (e) by FOWSA/ED with two critical sinks X and Y; (f) by FOWSA/ED with all sinks being critical. The delay and the normalized wiring area are shown in Table 3. <p> Although the Elmore delay model is more complicated than the upper-bound model used in <ref> [7] </ref>, our study has shown that optimal wiresizing under the distributed Elmore delay model can still be achieved in polynomial time very efficiently when the separability, the monotone property, and the dominance property are used to prune suboptimal wiresizing solutions. <p> The use of the distributed Elmore delay model successfully avoids the over-sizing problem in <ref> [7] </ref> and leads to additional reduction of the delays to the timing-critical sinks. In general, wiresizing will reduce the signal delay but in crease the wiring area.

Reference-contexts: Hence, every segment in MIN has width W 1 , and every segment in MAX has width 4W 1 . The placement of 100 4-sink nets and 100 8-sink nets were generated randomly, and the nets are routed by the batched 1-Steiner algorithm <ref> [12] </ref>. For each Steiner tree, a critical sink is chosen randomly. The delay to the critical sink (s) and the total wiring area of the different wiresizing solutions are compared. The signal delay is computed using the two-pole circuit simulator developed by Zhou et al. [16].
