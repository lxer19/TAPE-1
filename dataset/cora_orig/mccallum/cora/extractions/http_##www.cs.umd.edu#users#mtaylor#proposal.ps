Abstract: Knowledge discovery in Databases (KDD) is an emerging field in Artificial Intelligence. Fayyad, Piatetsky-Shapiro, & Smith define KDD as the non-trivial process of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns in data. The techniques and algorithms used in the discovery process vary from system to system. In this thesis proposal, I present a algorithm that induces classification rules at varying levels of generality. I will show that the algorithm has the potential to scale well by effectively pruning the rule space and exploiting parallel processing. The classification algorithm will be applied to the platelet transfusion database maintained by the Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins Hospital to induce useful rules for clinical decision support.

Reference-contexts: Thus the advent of the field of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). KDD has been defined as the non-trivial process of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns in data <ref> [1] </ref>. This thesis proposal describes a multi-level classification algorithm that utilizes concept taxonomies to generate high-level descriptions of data stored in relational databases. The algorithm will be used to induce useful information from the blood platelet transfusion database maintained by the Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins Hospital. <p> Knowledge discovery in databases can therefor be seen as an extension of the machine learning task. The discovery task in KDD varies from system to system. Fayyad et al. list Classification, Regression, Clustering, Summarization, Dependency Modeling, and, Change and Deviation Detection, as the primary tasks of KDD systems <ref> [1] </ref>. Classification systems attempt to find a mapping from data items to a set of predefined classes. One example is the goal of major lending institutions that want to find a mapping from loan applications to the two sets Accept and Deny.

Reference-contexts: Systems such as C4.5 have rule pruning modules that attempt to reduce the complexity of rules while maintaining an accept 3 able level of correctness after pruning. The second type of generalization can be found in systems such as DBLearn <ref> [2] </ref> and KRRL [3, 4]. These systems incorporate taxonomies into the mining process and use the information contained in the taxonomies to extract high-level information. DBLearn uses the taxonomies to generalize databases to a certain level of abstraction before applying search. <p> DBLearn DBLearn, created by Jiawei Han et al., is a data mining system that relies on concept taxonomies to guide the discovery process. The system is capable of creating, among others, rules that classify and characterize data. DBLearn has been characterized as an attribute oriented search data mining system <ref> [2] </ref>. The rules that it produces are disjunctions of conjunctions where the conjunctions are formed from the attribute values remaining in the tuples at the end of its search process. <p> If this threshold is set high enough MLClass will not report those rules that classify a small percentage of the objects in the data set. High thresholds, tend to result in few rules that are extremely general. Low thresholds can result in too many rules that are very specific <ref> [2] </ref>. Thus, the value of this threshold can impact the quality and quantity of rules produced by MLClass. The relevant attribute set, and the interestingness threshold influence the rules generated by MLClass. Combined, they express, to a certain extent, the nature of rules that MLClass should generate. <p> These techniques examine data sets by comparing tuples to intermediate results which were created from previous tuple comparisons. Consequently, these techniques can lead to an exponential explosion in the number of tuple comparisons. Han <ref> [2] </ref> proposed an attributed oriented approach to data generalization as the basis of DBLearn. DBLearn uses a bottom up approach, concept tree ascension, in which individual values are generalized one attribute at a time. <p> declination has not been determined but it is suspected that it is better that linear. 25 This process is repeated until all objects in the database satisfies at least one antecedent of the classification rules. 10 Example This section illustrates the classification algorithm applied to a small database used in <ref> [2] </ref>. Table 1 contains the data that will be used in this discussion. The concept hierarchies and there initial frequency counts are listed in Figure 3. The input vector for this example is &lt; (Category); (Graduate; U ndergraduate); (M ajor; BirthP lace; GP A); 0:08 &gt;.

If an exact match cannot be found, which is often the case, patients may receive platelets that are cross-matched with their own platelet types [8]. Platelets may be crossmatched if they are known to be HLA compatible with one another.

Punctures and lacerations of the skin as well as some diseases often lead to bleeding which is controlled by the amount of platelets present in the blood stream. <p> Humans receive two pairs of HLA types from both parents for a total of four HLA indicators for platelets. These HLA types are important because they dictate, to a certain extent, the platelet products that a patient should receive in a platelet transfusion <ref> [8] </ref>. 3.2 Transfusion Patients may receive a transfusion of platelets for a variety of medical conditions. Among these are, thrombocytopenia, thrombasthenia, and poly-cythemia just to name a few [9, 5]. Patients normally receive platelet transfusions to increase the concentration of platelets in the blood stream to clinically safe levels. <p> Since offsprings inherit their HLA antigens from their parents the probability of finding an exact match among siblings is 25% [6]. If an exact match cannot be found, which is often the case, patients may receive platelets that are cross-matched with their own platelet types <ref> [8] </ref>. Platelets may be crossmatched if they are known to be HLA compatible with one another. <p> The classification algorithm will be adapted to find conditions under which platelet transfusions were successful and those under which transfusions were unsuccessful. HLA compatibility is the common measure upon which patients are matched with donor platelets. This measure is not sufficient for predicting the success of a transfusion <ref> [8] </ref>. There exist medical conditions that may affect the survivability of transfused platelets. A patient's temperature may influence his/her response to a transfusion. Complications such as septicemia, spleno-megaly, and intravascular coagulation may also affect a patient's response to transfusions [8]. <p> measure is not sufficient for predicting the success of a transfusion <ref> [8] </ref>.

Again, the goal of this project will be to find those combinations of factors that have resulted in positive and negative responses to platelet transfusions.

However, the classes must be disjoint. An open problem in data mining is determining what attributes are relevant in a data set with respect to the mining task <ref> [10, 22, 23, 24] </ref>. MLClass does not address this problem. It takes as one of its inputs, a set of attributes to use during the mining process. These attributes are used in MLClass to automatically generate queries to be evaluated against the input data set.

In the case of machine learning, historically, the data set has been graciously massaged <ref> [11] </ref>. That is investigators make every attempt to design the data to cater to the machine learning task. Conversely, KDD systems often work on databases that were not initially designed for the discovery task. <p> Search can be conducted in either a top-down or bottom-up manner. Top-down search is usually referred to as model-driven search whereas data-driven search is usually associated with bottom-up techniques <ref> [11] </ref>. Furthermore, search strategies can be classified as either tentative or irrevocable. To guide the search, evaluation functions are used. These functions are usually created to reflect the degree to which to a rule is interesting and covers the data. <p> The process continues until all leaves are labeled with a single class. ID3's search process is irrevocable. It tries to find a simple tree but it does not seek an optimal tree <ref> [11] </ref>. Consequently, at times, ID3 can produce huge decision trees that are difficult to interpret. Although ID3 uses an information based heuristic it does not use background knowledge in the discovery process.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, data sampling is somewhat of a controversial practice. In an extension of Agrawal's work on discovering association rules, Mannila et al. suggest that sampling is an effective way of reducing the search space while maintaining the integrity of the discovered rules <ref> [12] </ref>. They suggest the use of Charnoff bounds to determine the sample size. Conversely, Kersten et al. suggest that sampling has the negative side effect of hiding interesting relationships [13]. By physically removing data, sampling reduces the search space at the expense of entropy.

The data sampling issue is heavily related to the more important search problem. <p> Efficient search engines offer 9 feasible solutions to problems related to search. For KDD, query processing is the most important aspect of the search process. Naturally, KDD systems should benefit from powerful querying technologies. As an example, consider Data Surveyor <ref> [13] </ref>. It is a data mining engine that exploits the power of parallel processing. The system relies on a parallel DBMS server to evaluate its queries. Consequently, Data Surveyor can issue many queries and receive results in a timely manner thus avoiding the problems related to sampling.

Reference-contexts: By using high level rules, DBLearn can generate rules that are compact. The rules are compact in the sense that a single high level concept covers several low level (raw data) concepts. Data Surveyor Data Surveyor, Holsheimer, is a data mining tool designed to find probabilistic classification rules <ref> [15] </ref>. It generates rules that reveal the likelihood that an attribute will have a particular value given the values of other attributes. The most interesting aspect of Data Surveyor is the support that it receives from Monet, a parallel DBMS. <p> ParkaDB will be used in this project to evaluate the strengths of the proposed descriptions. ParkaDB was chosen because it offers many advantages not found in other systems that could be used to evaluate proposed generalizations.

Reference-contexts: Data Surveyor does not use background knowledge to guide the search. It does however use a parallel query engine that alleviates one of the main problems of many data mining systems, efficient database scans. Quest Rakesh Agrawal presented a novel technique for the discovery of association rules in databases <ref> [16] </ref>. His algorithm works by repeatedly refining item sets, vectors of binary attribute values. The algorithm begins with an empty item set, the frontier. Item sets are added to the frontier based on their support in the database.

Klemettinen et.al. <ref> [25] </ref> take a similar approach with their use of rule templates to focus the data mining process. Consider the situation in which one would like to generate rules that classify student as graduate students or undergraduate students.

Reference-contexts: The main goal of this project is to create a data mining tool that generates rules for a clinical support system. To this end, clinicians and knowledge engineers should have a critical role in the discovery process <ref> [26] </ref>. By carefully selecting these inputs, clinicians and knowledge engineers should be able to express, in a limited manner, the nature of discovered information that is interesting. 9.2 Searching KB vs DB Many data mining techniques that attempt to generalize data are tuple oriented [27].

Reference-contexts: By carefully selecting these inputs, clinicians and knowledge engineers should be able to express, in a limited manner, the nature of discovered information that is interesting. 9.2 Searching KB vs DB Many data mining techniques that attempt to generalize data are tuple oriented <ref> [27] </ref>. These techniques examine data sets by comparing tuples to intermediate results which were created from previous tuple comparisons. Consequently, these techniques can lead to an exponential explosion in the number of tuple comparisons. Han [2] proposed an attributed oriented approach to data generalization as the basis of DBLearn.

Reference-contexts: HLA crossmatches can be represented as hierarchical structures since they are groups of HLA types in which each element is a specialization of a particular group. The quality of the various taxonomies will influence the utility of the data generated by the classification algorithm. In a study of DBLearn <ref> [28] </ref>, Hamilton reported that different taxonomies, varying in depth and breadth, lead to varying results.
