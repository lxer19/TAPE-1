Abstract: Genesis and ATIS are being developed under the umbrella of the Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems 1 to facilitate various kinds of travel, including daily commuting to work via private/public transportation and visiting new places and points of attraction. Travelers are naturally mobile, and the most effective way to aid travelers is via mobile computing, which is being explored in the Genesis project at Minnesota. The travelers can use personal communication devices including pagers and portable computers (e.g. Apple Newton) to avail themselves of the ATIS services provided by Genesis. This extended abstract presents an overview of the goals and preliminary design of Genesis. We believe that ATIS provides a very important commercial application of mobile computing and can be the killer application to bring mobile computing to mass markets. This paper describes the application domain rather than evaluating candidate solutions.

Several approaches to wireless communication are being explored, including Infrared and RF beacon technologies, FM sideband technology, Mobile satellite services, Cellular phone technology and Radio-Frequency (RF) data communication networks <ref> [6] </ref>. The User interface function communicates with the user (driver), accepting requests for service and delivering driving directions and other information. Direction screens present simple, highly stylized graphics that can be taken in at a glance.

In an enhanced client-server architecture, the client will request data from the server if data is not available in the client caches. In a page-based environment, the server will not just return the requested data, but will return all data stored in the same page as the requested data.

Reference-contexts: In a page-based environment, data is stored in the system's secondary storage, which consists of fixed, uniform-size pages. The main overhead during route computation or route evaluation is disk I/O. We have evaluated the performance of path computation algorithms on road map databases <ref> [15] </ref>. The choice of placing data to pages affects the query processing performance. We have proposed connectivity-clustered access methods (CCAM) to provide efficient management of road-map databases, which 12 reduce the number of pages accessed during updates, route evaluation, etc [16].

Lastly, parallel processing [17, 18] may be used to scale up to a realistic number of traveling events and provide each with a reasonable response time. 4.2.2 Enhanced Client-Server Query processing can be executed locally on the clients (PCDs). <p> After the client receives the page containing the requested data, the client can access all the data in that page. A technique that can reduce the number of pages accessed from secondary storage during route evaluation will also reduce the communication load and server overhead. CCAM <ref> [16] </ref> provides efficient management of data in server sites and further reduces the communication overhead. 4.3 Strategies to Handle Triggers As described in section 3.3, triggers are used to model events that need to be persistently monitored.
