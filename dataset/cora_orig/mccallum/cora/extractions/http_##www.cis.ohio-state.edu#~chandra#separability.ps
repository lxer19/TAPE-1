Abstract: In this paper we argue for a Separability Hypothesis as a working hypothesis for AI. There is no a priori equivalence of the terms mind and cognition. Phenomenologically, a mental state has a cognitive content as well as subjectivity and emotions. The Separability Hypothesis asserts that an architecture for intelligence is a homomorphism of the architecture for mind. None of the technical problems that AI is working on today require machines which have anything other than a cognitive content to them. We discuss how this Hypothesis protects AI from a number of its critics, and lets the field get on with its technical concerns. In both cognitive science and AI, the terms mind and cognition (or intelligence) are generally presumed to refer to one and the same thing. This is not an explicit doctrine of the fields in question, but more of a tacit assumption. Thus, both people within and outside AI take the questions, Can machines have a mind? and Can machines be intelligent? to be equivalent questions. A point of this paper is to argue that there is no a priori identity of these things. Both methodologically and philosophically it 1 Parts of this paper originally appeared in B.

Reference-contexts: In the theory of mind, eliminative materialism would be a member of this camp. The latest arrival in this camp is the claim for dynamical systems <ref> (Port and van Gelder,1995) </ref> as directly modeling physical states of brains. Whether these alternative proposals are as representation-free as their proposers claim can be debated (Chandrasekaran, et al, 1988; see also Vera and Simon, 1993, and discussion of that paper in the same issue of Cognitive Science ).
