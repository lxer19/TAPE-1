Abstract: Standard algorithms for finding the shortest path in a graph require that the cost of a path be additive in edge costs, and typically assume that costs are deterministic. We consider the problem of uncertain edge costs, with potential probabilistic dependencies among the costs. Although these dependencies violate the standard dynamic-programming decomposition, we identify a weaker stochastic consistency condition that justifies a generalized dynamic-programming approach based on stochastic dominance. We present a revised path-planning algorithm and prove that it produces optimal paths under time-dependent uncertain costs. We illustrate the algorithm by applying it to a model of stochastic bus networks, and present sample performance results comparing it to some alternatives. For the case where all or some of the uncertainty is resolved during path traversal, we extend the algorithm to produce optimal policies. fl This report is based on a paper presented at the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, August 1995.

Reference-contexts: If one path to a node dominates another (in the sense of stochastic ordering), then the stochastic consistency condition ensures that the latter cannot be part of an overall shortest path. This generalized use of the optimum principle <ref> [ Carraway, Morin, & Moskowitz, 1990 ] </ref> can lead to substantial savings if the network contains many dominated paths, as we would expect. 2 For example, we can simply delete the local train from the network, or, treat the express train as going directly to the distal node (which is of <p> Eiger, et al. [ 1985 ] show how utility functions that are linear or exponential in edge costs validate the optimality principle, and thus Dijkstra's algorithm. 21 The approach taken here is a version of generalized dynamic program-ming <ref> [ Carraway, Morin, & Moskowitz, 1990 ] </ref> , which is essentially dynamic programming with a totally ordered criterion replaced with a partial order. We have cast generalized DP as PFS with dominance-pruning, which leads to a concise algorithm description.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this shortest-path algorithm is not universally valid when the travel times are time-dependent <ref> [ Hall, 1986 ] </ref> . This sort of situation should be expected in realistic highway networks, where traffic patterns vary throughout the day, as well as in other transportation networks (e.g., bus routes), where transfer times depend on fixed schedules.

Reference-contexts: Without the decomposition that would be justified by this principle, it appears that we must in general explore all paths from origin to destination, an exponentially complex prospect. Let us return briefly to the deterministic case. For deterministic time dependence, it has been shown <ref> [ Kaufman & Smith, 1993 ] </ref> that the standard shortest-path algorithm is indeed sound as long as the network satisfies the following reasonable consistency condition.

Reference-contexts: This is true especially in the case of problems with multiple objectives (e.g., travel time, safety, expense, route familiarity), which have rarely been analyzed under stochastic assumptions (see <ref> [ List et al., 1991 ] </ref> for the few exceptions).

Reference-contexts: Indeed, as long as waiting at a location is allowed without penalty, we can impose stochastic consistency on any network. 2 Equation (2) is based on the concept of stochastic dominance <ref> [ Stoyan, 1983; Whitmore & Findlay, 1978 ] </ref> , a common way to extend an ordering relation to random variables. <p> Recall that dominance holds iff the cumulative probability of arrival by t (equation (5)) for A is at least as great as for B, for all t. It is easy to show that A dominates B iff M A M B and A B (see <ref> [ Stoyan, 1983 ] </ref> ). The former condition is perhaps obviously necessary; the earliest arrival time must be earlier for the dominating bus.

Reference-contexts: Given all this prior work, the specific contribution of this paper is a formulation of the stochastic consistency condition, and identifying stochastic dominance as the appropriate pruning criterion to apply in the PFS-Dominance algorithm. The idea of stochastic consistency is related to our previous work on qualitative probabilistic influences <ref> [ Wellman, 1990 ] </ref> ; the condition can be interpreted as saying that taking any edge is a positive influence on arrival time. The idea of imposing a consistency condition was inspired by the work of Kaufman and Smith [ 1993 ] (noted above) in the deterministic context.
