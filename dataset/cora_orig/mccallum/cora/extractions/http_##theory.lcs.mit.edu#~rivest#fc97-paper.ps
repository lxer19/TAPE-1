Title: Perspectives on Financial Cryptography  
Author: Ronald L. Rivest 
Affiliation: MIT Lab for Computer Science (RSA Security Dynamics)  
Abstract: I present some debatable propositions about financial systems and financial cryptography. (Warning: the propositions expressed may or may not be believed by the author, and may be phrased in a deliberately provocative manner. They may contradict each other. This paper follows the author's slides closely, and does not have all of the ancillary comments of the author and the audience.)

Reference-contexts: Central banks will have a smaller role to play, as their role is just to ensure the stability of the national currencies. 4 The dollar stays around Proposition 4: Cyberbucks won't displace national currencies. For a contrary view, read The Sovereign Individual by James Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg <ref> [1] </ref> wherein governments will implode as their debts spiral and their tax base disappears into cyberspace tax havens based on gold-backed Internet dollars. 5 Privacy is already lost Proposition 5: Individual privacy is already lost, and must be regained.
