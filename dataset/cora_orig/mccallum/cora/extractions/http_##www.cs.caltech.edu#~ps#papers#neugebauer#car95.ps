Abstract: Making use of CIM-systems ceramic inlays may be constructed, produced, and ground in dentistry applications. In this production process the geometry of the inlay has to be provided. Data from intra-oral 3D-sensors is necessary to support the dentist during the modeling of the inlay geometry. In this paper we present a new approach to limit the dentist's workload to the specification of characteristic points of the inlay in the modeling phase. The inlay geometry is reconstructed automatically using specialized edge tracing algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Using a double sided search and an efficient implementation the search takes only a fraction of a second on a workstation. The practicability of the presented algorithm was demonstrated for two dentistry applications. Other applications, like the detection of coronary arteries in X-ray projections <ref> [1] </ref>, are possible. Further work has to be done for the fully automation of the segmentation of tooth images. One of the main tasks in the future in this field is the model-based segmentation of tooth images.

Reference-contexts: In our approach, the required edge is traced automatically in the range image of the tooth. In comparison to local edge filters like the Canny operator <ref> [5] </ref>, only the actual needed construction line is detected and traced. The resulting edges are fully specified and show no gaps. Moreover, it is always guaranteed that the best edge between the two given points is found.

Reference-contexts: The cost function can be described as follows: costs (d) def c max else for 0:2 (2) More sophisticated cost functions are based e.g. on the angle between the normals to both sides of the edge <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A path from the root to a leaf is considered as an edge in the corresponding image. A cost value is assigned to each node of the tree, which is then used to guide the tree search. Using the A ? -tree-search-algorithm <ref> [7] </ref>, the cheapest path and, thus, the best edge in the sense of minimal costs is found. Starting from the root of the tree, the tree search method selects recursively the leaf with the respectively lowest costs from the OPEN-list. <p> In general, the costs consists of the costs g (P i ) from the root up to the actual pixel P i plus the estimated costs h (P i ) from the actual pixel to the end pixel [5] <ref> [7] </ref>. f (P i ) = g (P i ) + h (P i ) (1) For h (P i ) = 0 the search is called best first search.
