Reference-contexts: The second part of the paper deals with all circular graphs. This paper is a blend of several research reports <ref> [1, 3, 12] </ref> on this topic.

We call such a pair indifferent.

Reference-contexts: A weaker conjecture, i.e. the complement of a perfect graph is perfect, was proposed also by Berge, and proved in 1972 by Lovasz (see [11]). The results of Lovasz [11] and Padberg [13] yield certain properties of minimally imperfect graphs. Following the paper by Bland, Huang and Trotter <ref> [2] </ref>, for integers p; q 2, we say that a graph G is (p; q)-partitionable if, for every vertex v of G, the induced subgraph G v admits a partition into p cliques of cardinality q and also admits a partition into q stable sets of cardinality p. <p> It is easy to see that p must be equal to the maximum cardinality of a stable set in G, and similarly that q is the maximum cardinality of a clique in G. According to <ref> [2] </ref> (p; q)-partitionable graphs have the following properties: (i) G has exactly n = pq + 1 vertices; (ii) G has exactly n stable sets of cardinality p; (iii) G has exactly n cliques of cardinality q; (iv) Each maximum clique meets exactly n 1 of the maximum stable sets (and <p> It is not difficult to check on the graph C <ref> [3; 2; 2; 2] </ref> that, even up to the isomorphisms mentioned in Lemmas 1.3 and 1.4, this second transversal is not the same as the one given in the preceding proof. - 9 - Proof of Proposition 1.3 Let G be an n-vertex CGPW graph of Type 3 (hence n = <p> mentioned in Lemmas 1.3 and 1.4, this second transversal is not the same as the one given in the preceding proof. - 9 - Proof of Proposition 1.3 Let G be an n-vertex CGPW graph of Type 3 (hence n = 2 2r + 1), i.e., a variant of C <ref> [2; 2; ; 2; 2] </ref>. <p> Proposition 1.2 shows, however, that in CGPW graphs of type 2 there still exist small transversals. We conjecture that there exists a small transversal in any partitionable graph, except maybe in CGPW graphs of type 3. For the special case of C <ref> [2; 2; 2; 2] </ref> one can check that it has no small transversal at all, see e.g. [7]. It should be noted that any of the above two conjectures together with the results of this paper would imply the Strong Perfect Graph Conjecture.

Reference-contexts: Because of the strong similarity of this decomposition with what De Bruijn called "Degenerate British Number Systems" <ref> [4] </ref>, we suggest calling such a pair and any isomorphic pair a De Bruijn near-factorization of the cyclic group ZZ n . The number r will be called the rank of the near-factorization.

Reference-contexts: Any such graph and its variants will be denoted by G (A; B). Various properties of near-factors of groups were studied in <ref> [5] </ref>. Here we will be concerned only with near-factors in the cyclic group ZZ n . Given such a near factorization (A; B), it is possible to obtain another one through various tranformations: * Shifting. <p> Grinstead [8] showed that this is also true for swapping. Any such pair obtained through shifting, scaling or swapping will be considered isomorphic to (A; B). These isomorphisms induce an equivalence relation among the near-factors of ZZ n . A result of De Caen, Gregory, Hughes and Kreher <ref> [5] </ref> entails that every isomorphism class contains a pair (A; B) where both A and B are symmetric, i.e., A = A and B = B. This can also be derived from Grinstead's swapping argument.

Reference-contexts: Let us say that a (transversal) subset of vertices is small if its cardinality is at most ff + ! 1. Chvatal proved: Lemma 1.1 (see <ref> [6] </ref>) A minimally imperfect graph contains no small transversal. 2 We present a criterion which enables us to find a small transversal in many partitionable graphs.

Reference-contexts: This method would probably use a construction of all partitionable graphs. So far, two constructions are known for subclasses of partitionable graphs <ref> [7] </ref>. The first of these two constructions yields no counterexample to the Strong Perfect Graph Conjecture as shown by Andras Seb-o [14]. <p> It is important to notice that a given (p; q)-partitionable graph G may admit a pair of vertices that lies neither in a maximum clique nor in a maximum stable set of G. We call such a pair indifferent. As observed in <ref> [7] </ref>, adding to or removing from the edge set of G any choice of indifferent pairs yields another (p; q)-partitionable graph having the same maximum cliques and maximum stable sets as G. We call any such graph a variant of G. <p> Now we recall the definition of a subfamily of partitionable graphs introduced in <ref> [7] </ref>. For any two sets of integers X; Y , let X +Y denote the set fx+y j x 2 X; y 2 Y g. If X = fxg we will often write x + Y instead of fxg + Y . <p> We conjecture that there exists a small transversal in any partitionable graph, except maybe in CGPW graphs of type 3. For the special case of C [2; 2; 2; 2] one can check that it has no small transversal at all, see e.g. <ref> [7] </ref>. It should be noted that any of the above two conjectures together with the results of this paper would imply the Strong Perfect Graph Conjecture.

Reference-contexts: The second construction produces circular graphs, but we will show in the first part of this paper that it does not produce any counterexample to Berge's conjecture, thereby generalizing a result of Grinstead <ref> [8] </ref>. The second part of the paper deals with all circular graphs. This paper is a blend of several research reports [1, 3, 12] on this topic. <p> and similarly every maximum stable set. 2 Our main result is: Theorem 1.1 No CGPW graph with ff &gt; 2 and ! &gt; 2 is minimally imperfect. - 4 - The problem of knowing which minimally imperfect graphs can be obtained from the CGPW constructions was already studied by Grinstead <ref> [8] </ref>. In our terminology, Grinstead's result is that the normalized variant of any CGPW graph contains an odd hole or an odd antihole. Unfortunately this does not carry over to all variants, precisely because of the indifferent pairs. <p> Consider (A; B). - 11 - (Actually shifting and swapping can be defined for any group.) It is clear that any pair obtained from a near-factor of ZZ n by shifting or scaling is a near-factor. Grinstead <ref> [8] </ref> showed that this is also true for swapping. Any such pair obtained through shifting, scaling or swapping will be considered isomorphic to (A; B). These isomorphisms induce an equivalence relation among the near-factors of ZZ n .

Reference-contexts: Proposition 1.1 (Gurvich and Temkin <ref> [9] </ref>) If G is a CGPW graph of Type 1 with ff 3 and ! 3 then G admits a small transversal. 2 Proposition 1.2 If G is a CGPW graph of Type 2 with ff 3 and ! 3 then G admits a small transversal.

Reference-contexts: The proof that B is a father of 0 is similar. The desired conclusion now follows from the Parents Lemma. 2 This theorem implies that any circular counterexample to Berge's Strong Perfect Graph Conjecture has an odd number of vertices. It is conjectured in <ref> [10] </ref> that in any partitionable graph except CGPW graphs of type 2 and 3, there exists a vertex which has both a mother and a father. <p> According to the Parents Lemma, this would imply that all partitionable graphs, other than CGPW graphs of type 2 and 3, have a small transversal, and thus are not minimally imperfect. For graphs of order up to 24 this was verified in <ref> [10] </ref>. The equivalence of (a) and (d) in Lemma 1.5 shows that in CGPW graphs of type 2 and 3 there cannot be a vertex having both a mother and a father. Proposition 1.2 shows, however, that in CGPW graphs of type 2 there still exist small transversals.
