If a database recovery is required, each participant has to retransmit only those payments that were previously sent on Fedwire and indicate the loss of payments through the recovery report <ref> [3] </ref>. Future Changes The Federal Reserve is enhancing the Fedwires operating environment to reduce risk related to funds transfers and to increase the usefulness of Fedwire. The two most significant changes are the expansion of the operating hours and a new, expanded message format for funds transfers. <p> When all net debit obligations have been paid, the clearinghouse transfers funds via Fedwire to all settling participants in a net credit position and notifies all participants by 6:00 p.m. that settlement is complete <ref> [3] </ref>. Process Description The following example shows a typical CHIPS transfer process: 1. Bank A in Paris instructs its New York branch to pay $1 M to Bank B for deposit in the account of a particular company. 2. <p> participants have paid their respective amounts to this account, NYCHA sends Fedwire funds transfers from the CHIPS account at FRBNY to settling participants in a net credit position. d) Prior to this, the non-settling participants will have settled with their settling participants and settlement is normally completed by 5:10 p.m. <ref> [3] </ref>. Regulatory Information All CHIPS participants are supervised by the New York State Banking Department or a federal bank supervisor. CHIPS transfers are governed by UCC Article 4A. This subsection details the rights and obligations of the various participants in a wire transfer. Statistical Information Table 3 displays CHIPS statistics. <p> 154,439 167,311 181,667 203,318 212,544 Average Daily Transfer Value $942 billion $1 trillion $1 trillion $1 trillion $1 trillion Average Value per Transfer $6 million $6 million $7 million $6 million $6 million Fees per Transaction $0.15 $0.15 $0.15 $0.15 $0.15 Number of CHIPS participants 122 121 115 111 103 <ref> [3] </ref> Table 3: CHIPS Statistics Risks and Risk Mitigation Strategies Risk Risk Mitigation Systemic risk/counterparty credit Same-day settlement Bilateral credit limits Net debit caps Loss sharing-backed up by collateral Membership requirements Operational Risks Backup facilities Automated recovery Risk 1: Systemic risk/counterparty credit This risk occurs when one participant fails to meet <p> Because of the trillions of dollars sent over CHIPS, even any temporary outage would present serious economic and financial risks. Mitigation 2: Automated recovery CHIPS has a computerized method for rebuilding its database. According to the NYCHA, CHIPS quarterly tests its contingency plans in mandatory exercises involving all participants <ref> [3] </ref>. 2.5 RETAIL PAYMENT SYSTEMS A discussion of small-dollar retail payment systems includes checks, credit cards, and the Automated Clearing House (ACH). <p> Bank A processes the checks using its sorting equipment, capturing data on the value of each check written by each of its customers. Bank A then debits Customer As account. 9. On day 2-5, Bank B makes the $100 available to Company B <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> The card-issuing bank pays the major credit card company via Fedwire. 7. The major credit card company pays the merchant bank. 8. The card-issuing bank then bills the cardholder. 9. Card-issuing bank receives payment from the cardholder <ref> [3] </ref>. Step 1 is the only Authorization procedure. Steps 2-4 correspond to the Clearance procedure. Steps 5-9 determine Settlement. The credit card companies are international in nature (cardmembers all over the world are making charges every day). <p> Mitigation: Credit Monitoring Issuing banks can mitigate these credit risks through the normal authorization process of charges and credit reviews of customers. If a customer has been delinquent on a bill, the card-issuer can deny authorization for a transaction. Financial standards can also be applied in the application process <ref> [3] </ref>. 2.5.3 Automated Clearing House An automated clearing house (ACH) network is an electronic batch processing system by which payment orders are exchanged among financial institutions. <p> This payment is now provisionally settled. 8. Each of the employees banks posts the value of their pay to their accounts, making it available at the opening of business. 9. After the Federal Reserve completes its accounting and settlement of the ACH transaction is final <ref> [3] </ref>. The steps involved in an ACH debit transaction are the following: 1. The mortgage company (originator) prepares the withdrawal information and submits the information to its deposit institution, Bank A, in San Francisco. 2. <p> VISA settlement is final when Bank A is credited. Bank A makes the funds available to the mortgage company no later than close-of-business that day <ref> [3] </ref>. Regulatory Information The ACH is primarily governed by private sector bodies. The National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) has set forth the NACHA Operating Rules and Guidelines as the operating rules for electronic payments through the ACH. <p> Res.

The mission of air traffic control is to promote the safe, orderly, and expeditious movement of aircraft [7]. The Federal Aviation Administration is responsible for providing the NAS infrastructure to enable air operations in the United States, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year [3]. <p> There are two goals that must be met by the Air Traffic Control system: safety and efficiency <ref> [4] </ref>. To ensure safety, minimum separation must be maintained between aircraft as they pass through the national airspace. Efficient air traffic control, however, requires that separation not be so great as to adversely affect the flow of traffic through the airspace [4]. <p> by the Air Traffic Control system: safety and efficiency <ref> [4] </ref>. To ensure safety, minimum separation must be maintained between aircraft as they pass through the national airspace. Efficient air traffic control, however, requires that separation not be so great as to adversely affect the flow of traffic through the airspace [4]. This section explores the history of air traffic control and evolution of the systems that comprise the Air Traffic Control system. An overview of the major facilities involved in air traffic control is provided. <p> Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) The Air Traffic Control System Command Center coordinates operations between en route centers and provides scheduling and monitoring support. Reference <ref> [4] </ref> contains a figure showing the interaction between the different facilities. Each of the facilities will be explored in more detail in subsequent sections. The Air Traffic Control system is a complex system of systems [11]. <p> Information on flight strips is communicated between the Airport Tower and TRACON using the FDIO Computer <ref> [4] </ref>. 4.3.2 Display Systems Digital Bright Radar Indicator Tower Equipment (DBRITE) DBRITE is a radar display to augment visual control of airborne traffic around the airport. Aircraft information from TRACON computer systems is displayed on the DBRITE radar screen, including information on aircraft not yet under Airport Tower control [4]. 4.3.3 <p> Computer <ref> [4] </ref>. 4.3.2 Display Systems Digital Bright Radar Indicator Tower Equipment (DBRITE) DBRITE is a radar display to augment visual control of airborne traffic around the airport. Aircraft information from TRACON computer systems is displayed on the DBRITE radar screen, including information on aircraft not yet under Airport Tower control [4]. 4.3.3 Radar Systems Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR) ASR is radar used to monitor the airspace around an airport. ASR-9 is the version of system installed in the early 1990s; it is IC-based radar that can track a target within 300 feet at a 20-mile range [5]. <p> Raytheon is the contractor for the next generation ASR, digital radar to be phased in between 1999 and 2007. Airport Surface Detection Equipment (ASDE) ASDE is ground surveillance radar to monitor the runways at an airport [5]. ASDE detects both aircraft and ground vehicles <ref> [4] </ref>. The current version, ASDE-3, has been installed in 29 of 40 scheduled airports. It is high-resolution radar designed to overcome adverse weather conditions. <p> Information includes aircraft call sign, aircraft type, destination, and location. There are different versions of the ARTS computer system at the various TRACON locations; later versions provide automated monitoring and warning systems <ref> [4] </ref>. ARTS is comprised of linked Sperry-Univac 1140 computers. A serious problem with ARTS computers is that they are acutely limited in memory [5]. Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) A replacement system salvaged from the failed Advanced Automation System effort is the STARS. <p> The HOST computer primarily processes flight data and radar data for display in the ARTCCs <ref> [4] </ref>. In addition, it provides alerts of possible aircraft separation violations and processes weather data [9]. <p> The HOST computer system runs on IBM 3083 computers [5]. 4.5.2 Display Systems Plan View Display (PVD) The PVD is the digitized display at En Route Centers showing estimates of the current location of radar targets using information from the HOST computer <ref> [4] </ref>. Display Channel Complex (DCC) The DCC accepts radar and flight data from the HOST computer system and processes it for display on the controller screens, the PVDs. The DCC was designed in the 1960s and runs on IBM 9020E mainframes. <p> In addition, the ATCSCC establishes data flows for 28 major airports. The ATCSCC provides central flow control: primarily monitoring, not active participation. ATCSCC uses the HOST computer system to monitor traffic and has a data link to computers in Cambridge, MA for display purposes <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This had been a market traditionally dominated by railroads. Recognizing the danger to the country by the probable loss of a viable rail transportation system in America, Congress passed the Staggers Rail Act in 1980. It moved the supervision of the railroad industry to the Interstate Commerce Commission <ref> (eventually eliminated by Congress in 1995) </ref>. By removing most of the regulations and restrictions that had hindered the industry, the Staggers Act allowed the railroads the flexibility necessary to meet the competition of the motor carriers. <p> Schedule slips occurred almost immediately into the project. In 1992, Loral Space and Communications purchased IBM Federal Systems. By 1994, the FAA had cancelled the program with expected costs to complete of $7.6 billion <ref> [5] </ref>.

Raytheon is the primary contractor for STARS, which resolves information from multiple radars to track aircraft. The system is being developed in C to run on Sun UltraSparc UNIX workstations [5]. A detailed analysis of the STARS development effort is being conducted by the GAO [16]. 4.4.2 Display Systems Data Entry and Display Subsystem (DEDS) Information from the ARTS computer system is displayed on DEDSs. <p> The DEDS was designed in the 1960s and has reliability problems relating to the age of the equipment <ref> [5] </ref>. Full Digital ARTS Display (FDAD) A more recent display facility for the ARTS computer system is the FDADs. In contrast to the DEDS, the FDAD is was designed in the 1980s and is a microprocessor-based system [5]. 4.5 AIR ROUTE TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTERS (ARTCC) There are 20 ARTCCs, also called <p> the 1960s and has reliability problems relating to the age of the equipment <ref> [5] </ref>. Full Digital ARTS Display (FDAD) A more recent display facility for the ARTS computer system is the FDADs. In contrast to the DEDS, the FDAD is was designed in the 1980s and is a microprocessor-based system [5]. 4.5 AIR ROUTE TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTERS (ARTCC) There are 20 ARTCCs, also called En Route Centers, throughout the country, controlling aircraft in flight across the continental United States. Each En Route Center handles a region of airspace, responsible for commercial aircraft above 18,000 feet. <p> The HOST computer primarily processes flight data and radar data for display in the ARTCCs [4]. In addition, it provides alerts of possible aircraft separation violations and processes weather data [9]. The HOST computer system runs on IBM 3083 computers <ref> [5] </ref>. 4.5.2 Display Systems Plan View Display (PVD) The PVD is the digitized display at En Route Centers showing estimates of the current location of radar targets using information from the HOST computer [4]. <p> The DCCR replaces the 1960s IBM computers with an IBM ES/9121 mainframe to translate data from the HOST computer system for the PVD <ref> [5] </ref>. The two primary components of the Summaries of Three Critical Infrastructure Applications University of Virginia 47 Dept. of Computer Science DCCR are the Display Channel Rehost Processor (DCRP) and Display Controller and Switch (DC&S) [9]. <p> The software is implemented in C and Ada running on IBM 6000 RISC workstations with the AIX operating system. DSR is currently in testing and is expected to be operational in the first ARTCC site in October, 1998 <ref> [5] </ref>. 4.5.3 Radar Systems Air Route Surveillance Radar (ARSR) ARSR is three-dimensional, long-range radar for tracking aircraft through the ARTCC regions.

Reference-contexts: The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) was created to act as watchdog and administrator of the safety of the rail transportation system. The fear of possible reregulation will play a part in some of the technology decisions that face the railroad industry <ref> [6] </ref>. The recent development of intermodal shipping seems to offer a great opportunity for the railroad industry. By allowing goods to be shipped by the most efficient mode of transportation, whether by water, rail, or road, the railroads seem poised to gain market share. <p> Each system incorporates all or part of the AAR information network into their train control systems. While there are many similarities among them, each system evolved independently. The systems integration problems encountered by the recent mergers indicate that there are great differences between the individual systems <ref> [6] </ref>. This will slow any efforts to integrate the entire railroad system in the future. 3.5 RAILINC The information transfers necessary to integrate the AAR systems are distributed to the railroads via RAILINC. RAILINC is a communications network designed to be easily distributed. It is not hardware or software specific. <p> In particular, the United States General Account Office (GAO) has conducted numerous studies and produced many reports detailing the current and proposed Air Traffic Control system, including annual reports on the modernization effort <ref> [6] </ref>, [8]. GAO designated air traffic control as one of the high-risk infrastructure systems for the United States [12]. The FAA has spent billions of dollars on modernization since 1981 and expects to spend $34 billion through the year 2003 [13].

Reference-contexts: The primary services that banks provide are depository accounts (bank liabilities), loans (bank assets), and transfer facilities to move money from account to account (within the same institution or between institutions). Noncash payments (value transfers) account for almost 100% of the value of all transactions <ref> [18] </ref>. The following timeline shows the key historical events in the development of the U.S. <p> The payment system has public good characteristics that require a certain amount of official oversight that are usually discharged by a central bank. 7. The final interbank settlement is best accomplished by the transfer of balances held in accounts with the central bank (no interest earned on these balances) <ref> [18] </ref>. A major issue in financial payment systems is the regulation of large-value transfer systems. The essence of the United States legal regime governing large-value transfer systems can be summarized by the following five rules: 1. <p> Receiver finality rule: to establish when credit to an account is irrevocable. 4. Money back guarantee: to cover situations where a funds transfer is not completed, combined with a discharge rule for cases where the transfer is completed. 5. Antifraud rule: to allocate liability for fraudulent transactions <ref> [18] </ref>. In order to understand payments systems, several terms must be defined. Payment system refers to the means by which monetary value and related information is transferred. <p> The most significant risks and associated mitigation strategies are discussed. An example of a business risk is the counterparty/credit risk that one party in a transaction will fail to fulfill its obligation. Wholesale systems for large-value payments generally have greater security and risk controls than do retail systems <ref> [18] </ref>. 2.3 FEDERAL RESERVE: THE NATIONS CENTRAL BANK The Federal Reserve System was created in 1913 to manage the nations money supply and provide stability to the nations financial markets. <p> Every bank must be prepared to meet customers needs to send money to or receive money from any economic entity holding an account at any other bank in the system. A central institution that provides account services to virtually the entire banking industry is required for efficient settlement <ref> [18] </ref>. The Federal Reserve System is composed of 12 regional banks along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., 25 branch offices, and 11 regional check processing centers nationwide. 9,500 of the nations 26,000 banks are members of the Federal Reserve. <p> If overdraft amount reaches a predefined cap, transaction is either rejected or pending until covering funds are received. Settlement is guaranteed against failure of largest net debtor defaulting on its obligation by participants in arrangement and a loss sharing procedure is in place to back up guarantee <ref> [18] </ref>. Table 1. Summary Profile of Large-Value Systems 2.4.1 Fedwire Electronic Transfer of Funds The Fedwire funds transfer service allows depository institutions to transfer funds for their own accounts or customer accounts. Approximately 11,000 institutions have access to Fedwire [18]. <p> a loss sharing procedure is in place to back up guarantee <ref> [18] </ref>. Table 1. Summary Profile of Large-Value Systems 2.4.1 Fedwire Electronic Transfer of Funds The Fedwire funds transfer service allows depository institutions to transfer funds for their own accounts or customer accounts. Approximately 11,000 institutions have access to Fedwire [18]. The Department of the Treasury and other federal agencies also use Fedwire to make payments and collect funds. Fedwire is real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system that operates from 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) to 6:30 p.m. <p> Typically, however, banks participating in check clearing houses use the Federal Reserves net settlement service to effect settlement for the checks exchanged each day. Examples include the largest banks, e.g. Citicorp, Chase, etc. Federal Reserve Banks: The Federal Reserve operates a comprehensive, nationwide system for clearing and settling checks <ref> [18] </ref>. Clearing houses are voluntary associations of depository institutions that facilitate the exchange of payment transactions (checks) at a centralized location. In 1853, the first clearing house in the United States was established as the New York Clearing House Association. Presently, there are about 150 private clearing houses. <p> Mitigation 2: Electronic check presentment (ECP) Electronic check presentment permits the paying bank to identify earlier the checks that cannot be paid and notify the bank of first deposit of an impending returned check <ref> [18] </ref>. Future Changes Clearing houses, the banking industry, and the Federal Reserve are developing new technologies to shorten the time it takes to clear and settle checks. Electronic check presentment (ECP) is a process by which MICR-line information is sent electronically to the paying bank. <p> The primary constraint to the growth of check truncation and imaging is the consumer preference for their returned checks. Current banking law requires banks to physically present checks to paying banks to obtain settlement for checks <ref> [18] </ref>. 2.5.2 Credit Cards A credit card is a payment card issued to a person for purchasing goods and services against an established line of credit.

Bank A then debits Customer As account. 9. On day 2-5, Bank B makes the $100 available to Company B <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> The card-issuing bank pays the major credit card company via Fedwire. 7. The major credit card company pays the merchant bank. 8. The card-issuing bank then bills the cardholder. 9. Card-issuing bank receives payment from the cardholder <ref> [3] </ref>. Step 1 is the only Authorization procedure. Steps 2-4 correspond to the Clearance procedure. Steps 5-9 determine Settlement. The credit card companies are international in nature (cardmembers all over the world are making charges every day). <p> Mitigation: Credit Monitoring Issuing banks can mitigate these credit risks through the normal authorization process of charges and credit reviews of customers. If a customer has been delinquent on a bill, the card-issuer can deny authorization for a transaction. Financial standards can also be applied in the application process <ref> [3] </ref>. 2.5.3 Automated Clearing House An automated clearing house (ACH) network is an electronic batch processing system by which payment orders are exchanged among financial institutions. <p> This payment is now provisionally settled. 8. Each of the employees banks posts the value of their pay to their accounts, making it available at the opening of business. 9.

Reference-contexts: The primary services that banks provide are depository accounts (bank liabilities), loans (bank assets), and transfer facilities to move money from account to account (within the same institution or between institutions). Noncash payments (value transfers) account for almost 100% of the value of all transactions <ref> [18] </ref>. The following timeline shows the key historical events in the development of the U.S. <p> The payment system has public good characteristics that require a certain amount of official oversight that are usually discharged by a central bank. 7. The final interbank settlement is best accomplished by the transfer of balances held in accounts with the central bank (no interest earned on these balances) <ref> [18] </ref>. A major issue in financial payment systems is the regulation of large-value transfer systems. The essence of the United States legal regime governing large-value transfer systems can be summarized by the following five rules: 1. <p> Receiver finality rule: to establish when credit to an account is irrevocable. 4. Money back guarantee: to cover situations where a funds transfer is not completed, combined with a discharge rule for cases where the transfer is completed. 5. Antifraud rule: to allocate liability for fraudulent transactions <ref> [18] </ref>. In order to understand payments systems, several terms must be defined. Payment system refers to the means by which monetary value and related information is transferred. <p> The most significant risks and associated mitigation strategies are discussed. An example of a business risk is the counterparty/credit risk that one party in a transaction will fail to fulfill its obligation. Wholesale systems for large-value payments generally have greater security and risk controls than do retail systems <ref> [18] </ref>. 2.3 FEDERAL RESERVE: THE NATIONS CENTRAL BANK The Federal Reserve System was created in 1913 to manage the nations money supply and provide stability to the nations financial markets. <p> Every bank must be prepared to meet customers needs to send money to or receive money from any economic entity holding an account at any other bank in the system. A central institution that provides account services to virtually the entire banking industry is required for efficient settlement <ref> [18] </ref>. The Federal Reserve System is composed of 12 regional banks along with the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., 25 branch offices, and 11 regional check processing centers nationwide. 9,500 of the nations 26,000 banks are members of the Federal Reserve. <p> If overdraft amount reaches a predefined cap, transaction is either rejected or pending until covering funds are received. Settlement is guaranteed against failure of largest net debtor defaulting on its obligation by participants in arrangement and a loss sharing procedure is in place to back up guarantee <ref> [18] </ref>. Table 1. Summary Profile of Large-Value Systems 2.4.1 Fedwire Electronic Transfer of Funds The Fedwire funds transfer service allows depository institutions to transfer funds for their own accounts or customer accounts. Approximately 11,000 institutions have access to Fedwire [18]. <p> a loss sharing procedure is in place to back up guarantee <ref> [18] </ref>. Table 1. Summary Profile of Large-Value Systems 2.4.1 Fedwire Electronic Transfer of Funds The Fedwire funds transfer service allows depository institutions to transfer funds for their own accounts or customer accounts. Approximately 11,000 institutions have access to Fedwire [18]. The Department of the Treasury and other federal agencies also use Fedwire to make payments and collect funds. Fedwire is real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system that operates from 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) to 6:30 p.m. <p> Typically, however, banks participating in check clearing houses use the Federal Reserves net settlement service to effect settlement for the checks exchanged each day. Examples include the largest banks, e.g. Citicorp, Chase, etc. Federal Reserve Banks: The Federal Reserve operates a comprehensive, nationwide system for clearing and settling checks <ref> [18] </ref>. Clearing houses are voluntary associations of depository institutions that facilitate the exchange of payment transactions (checks) at a centralized location. In 1853, the first clearing house in the United States was established as the New York Clearing House Association. Presently, there are about 150 private clearing houses. <p> Mitigation 2: Electronic check presentment (ECP) Electronic check presentment permits the paying bank to identify earlier the checks that cannot be paid and notify the bank of first deposit of an impending returned check <ref> [18] </ref>. Future Changes Clearing houses, the banking industry, and the Federal Reserve are developing new technologies to shorten the time it takes to clear and settle checks. Electronic check presentment (ECP) is a process by which MICR-line information is sent electronically to the paying bank. <p> The primary constraint to the growth of check truncation and imaging is the consumer preference for their returned checks. Current banking law requires banks to physically present checks to paying banks to obtain settlement for checks <ref> [18] </ref>. 2.5.2 Credit Cards A credit card is a payment card issued to a person for purchasing goods and services against an established line of credit.

Reference-contexts: Between the end of World War II and 1980, the railroad share of the inter-city freight transportation market dropped from 67 percent to 36 percent <ref> [40] </ref>. This had been a market traditionally dominated by railroads. Recognizing the danger to the country by the probable loss of a viable rail transportation system in America, Congress passed the Staggers Rail Act in 1980. <p> The shift to automated systems by the railroads is designed, in part, to increase the rate of on-time deliveries. Despite these problems, the rail transportation share of the freight transportation market has increased from thirty-six percent to more than forty percent since 1990 <ref> [40] </ref>. Since the Staggers Act, a consolidation of the railroad industry has taken place. In 1980, thirty-eight Class 1 (the largest railroad category, measured by revenues) railroads were in existence.

Bank A then debits Customer As account. 9. On day 2-5, Bank B makes the $100 available to Company B <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> The card-issuing bank pays the major credit card company via Fedwire. 7. The major credit card company pays the merchant bank. 8. The card-issuing bank then bills the cardholder. 9. Card-issuing bank receives payment from the cardholder <ref> [3] </ref>. Step 1 is the only Authorization procedure. Steps 2-4 correspond to the Clearance procedure. Steps 5-9 determine Settlement. The credit card companies are international in nature (cardmembers all over the world are making charges every day). <p> Mitigation: Credit Monitoring Issuing banks can mitigate these credit risks through the normal authorization process of charges and credit reviews of customers. If a customer has been delinquent on a bill, the card-issuer can deny authorization for a transaction. Financial standards can also be applied in the application process <ref> [3] </ref>. 2.5.3 Automated Clearing House An automated clearing house (ACH) network is an electronic batch processing system by which payment orders are exchanged among financial institutions. <p> This payment is now provisionally settled. 8.

The fear of possible reregulation will play a part in some of the technology decisions that face the railroad industry <ref> [6] </ref>. The recent development of intermodal shipping seems to offer a great opportunity for the railroad industry. By allowing goods to be shipped by the most efficient mode of transportation, whether by water, rail, or road, the railroads seem poised to gain market share. <p> Each system incorporates all or part of the AAR information network into their train control systems. While there are many similarities among them, each system evolved independently. The systems integration problems encountered by the recent mergers indicate that there are great differences between the individual systems <ref> [6] </ref>. This will slow any efforts to integrate the entire railroad system in the future. 3.5 RAILINC The information transfers necessary to integrate the AAR systems are distributed to the railroads via RAILINC. RAILINC is a communications network designed to be easily distributed. It is not hardware or software specific. <p> In particular, the United States General Account Office (GAO) has conducted numerous studies and produced many reports detailing the current and proposed Air Traffic Control system, including annual reports on the modernization effort <ref> [6] </ref>, [8].
