Abstract: Current internet applications leave our physical presence and our real-world environment behind. This paper describes the development of several simple, inexpensive, internet-controlled, untethered tele-robots or PRoPs (Personal Roving Presences) to provide the sensation of tele-embodiment in a remote real space. These devices support at least video and two-way audio as well as mobility through the remote space they inhabit. The physical tele-robot serves both as an extension of its operator and as a visible, mobile entity with which other people can interact. PRoPs enable their users to perform a wide gamut of human activities in the remote space, such as wandering around, conversing with people, hanging out, pointing, examining objects, reading, and making simple gestures.

Reference-contexts: We propose a teleop-erational variation on Asimov's first law of robotics 3 which 3 A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. Handbook of Robotics, 56th Edition, 2058 A.D., as quoted in I, Robot by Asimov <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> stipulates that at no time should a PRoP ever be capable of injuring a human being, regardless of the action or inaction of the remote tele-operator. The tele-robot's abilities, physical attachments, and even the basic construction must all be considered.

Reference-contexts: This relatively simple PRoP head provides a vitally important element of human communication, direction of attention or gaze as discussed by several researchers <ref> [ 2; 9 ] </ref> . This allows PRoPs to perform human-like conversational gestures such as turning to face someone in order to see them, address them, or just give attention to them.

Reference-contexts: Soon afterwards, we developed Mechanical Gaze [ 13 ] , a tele-robotic system where uses could control a camera's viewpoint and image resolution to observe various museum artifacts placed within the robot's workspace. By 1995, Goldberg had developed another telerobotic system called the TeleGarden <ref> [ 8 ] </ref> in which WWW users are able to observe, plant, and nurture life within a living remote garden. As of this writing, well over several hundred interesting mechanical devices are connected to the WWW with more spawning daily.

Reference-contexts: Social and psychological aspects of extended human-human interactions motivate the design of our PRoPs and we have identified a wide range of research in this area. Shared spaces and human interaction with video walls such as the VideoWhiteboard [ 17 ] designed at Xerox PARC and later Ishii's ClearBoard <ref> [ 9 ] </ref> are fundamental to designing usable PRoPs.

Reference-contexts: This problem is remedied by incorporating a small movable head (i.e. a camera on a controllable pan-tilt platform) onto the PRoP. Our device is similar to the GestureCam <ref> [ 11 ] </ref> which allows a remote participant in a conversation to have direct control of his or her visual field of view.

Reference-contexts: In essence, telepresence 2 for the masses. 1 To convey the idea of these remote-control tools, scientists often use the words teleoperators or telefactors. I prefer to call them telepresences, a name suggested by my futurist friend Pat Gunkel. <ref> [ 12 ] </ref> 2 More specifically we are referring to tele-embodiment, tele-robotics, or tele-action. This is to avoid the ambiguity caused by the term telepresence which has grown in recent years to describe PRoP) hardware configuration.

Reference-contexts: This led us to identified the need for at least two levels of video resolution or Telepresence with Extra Eyes <ref> [ 18 ] </ref> . The system should provide a wide angle view similar to the human eye for navigating and recognizing people (and objects) and also a smaller field of view for reading text on paper, white-boards, doors, and computer screens.
