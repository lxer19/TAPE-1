Abstract: The Multicast Backbone (MBone) is a virtual network that has been in operation since 1992. Through this experimental network, researchers have been learning how to deliver a scalable, one-to-many multicast service. While much of the focus on multicast research continues to be on addressing the challenges of the traditional Internet, other "non-traditional" infrastructures, like satellite, cable, and wireless networks are beginning to be recognized as important environments in which to provide and use multicast communication. The inherent broadcast nature of these networks suggests that multicast might be easier to provide as compared to the traditional Internet. In this paper, we examine how to deliver MBone sessions and MBone style applications over satellite links. We have already demonstrated the basic feasibility of delivering MBone sessions over a satellite network. The next step is to answer the question of whether a satellite network can offer performance and cost advantages. The focus of this paper is a quantitative analysis of three performance metrics: loss, jitter, and delay.

Reference-contexts: Section 5 lists the characteristics of MBone sessions most suitable for delivery via satellite links. Future work is presented in Section 6. 2 2 Overview of the Multicast Backbone (MBone) The main testing environment for global multicast communication has been the Multicast Backbone (MBone). The MBone <ref> [1] </ref> is an experimental virtual network created to provide the means for multicasting data to any number of connected hosts. In 1992, 20 sites connected together via a rudimentary multicast network and received audio transmissions from the March meeting of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)[2].

Reference-contexts: Globally broadcast, streamed MBone sessions are a combination of the standard media types of audio, video, wb, and text. Information about these sessions are periodically transmitted across the MBone on a well-known multicast address. Using the Session DiRectory (sdr) tool <ref> [6] </ref>, MBone users can obtain a list of advertised sessions. Through sdr, an MBone user can choose from this list and launch the MBone tools (including audio [7], video [8], whiteboard [9], or text [10]) required to receive the component streams of a session.

For the first time at the 40th IETF in Washington DC, during the week of December 8-12, 1997, we delivered both IETF audio/video sessions. The primary lessons in the first attempts was how to bridge streaming multicast data onto a satellite network.

Reference-contexts: The types of data collected and the tools used for each include: * Group membership using mlisten: The mlisten tool <ref> [15] </ref> was used to collect group membership, join inter-arrival time, and membership duration information for each component of the two IETF channels. The mlisten tool works by joining each multicast group and noting the arrival of RTCP packets from each group receiver.

Reference-contexts: The mlisten tool does not look at data contained in RTCP packets and so does not collect information about packet loss and jitter. * Collecting packet loss, jitter, and delay: All of the sessions transmitted over the MBone were recorded at the source using the rtpdump utility <ref> [16] </ref>. This tool collects both RTP and RTCP packets. These files can be processed and the RTCP feedback packets from all receivers can be used to determine loss, jitter, and an estimate of the round-trip time.

Reference-contexts: The satellite receiver used a similar method, but statistics were gathered in real-time as the session was happening. Similar techniques have been used to study loss in other sessions <ref> [17] </ref>. The biggest challenge was trying to estimate one-way delay both for terrestrial- and satellite-based receivers. For terrestrial receivers we use RTP sequence times and timing information from RTCP feedback packets to estimate the round-trip time.

Reference-contexts: Using RTCP-style packets we compute the terrestrial round trip time and the terrestrial-plus-satellite round trip time. We can then estimate one-way delay over the satellite using these numbers. * Multicast tree construction: In order to record the multicast routes used from the source to each receiver, the mhealth tool <ref> [18] </ref> was used. Mhealth is a management tool that captures RTCP data and performs an mtrace [19] to each receiver.

Reference-contexts: RTCP provides a mechanism to estimate round trip time because the source sends its timestamp in each RTP packet, and this is returned in the RTCP packet plus additional information about the elapsed time between when the receiver got the packet and when it sent 12 the RTCP feedback packet <ref> [21] </ref>. Computing an estimate of one-way delay is a matter of computing the round trip time, subtracting the receiver's "hold" time and dividing by two.
