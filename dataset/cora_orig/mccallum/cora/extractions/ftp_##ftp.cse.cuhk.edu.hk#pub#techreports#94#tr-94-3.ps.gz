Abstract: The problem of single-vehicle scheduling with ready time and deadline constraints can be applicable to many practical transportation problems. But the general case is a generalization of classical Traveling Salesman Problem and it is NP-hard. Psaraftis[1] presented an O(n 2 ) algorithm for vehicle scheduling problems where the topological structure of sites are restricted to straight line and there is no deadline for each site. He conjectured that this problem is NP-hard if each site has an arbitrary ready time and deadline (called time window). In this paper, we prove the conjecture and show that the decision versions of vehicle scheduling problems on a straight line topology with time window are NP-complete for both path and tour versions. We also give an O(n 2 ) algorithm to solve a special case of this problem in which all sites have a common ready time. This algorithm is applicable to both path and tour versions.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, many of the interesting routing problems are NP-complete [2]. Karuno proved the VSP on a tree topology with arbitrary degree and ready time only is NP-hard [5]. Psaraftis <ref> [1] </ref> proposed a new model for routing of ships for a shoreline topology. He gave an O (n 2 ) algorithm for solving the path version of the VSP on a convex shoreline with ready time only, where n denotes the number of sites. <p> This topology is equivalent to a straight line structure. The trivial case of non-overlapping time windows can be solved by visiting sites with increasing order of ready time in O (n log n) time <ref> [1] </ref>. Psaraftis conjectured that the generalized problem with both ready time and deadline is NP-hard. In this paper, we show the Psaraftis's conjecture and prove that the decision versions of the VSP on a straight line with time windows for both path and tour versions are NP-complete. <p> In section 3, we prove the conjecture given by Psaraftis <ref> [1] </ref> and show that the decision problems of the vehicle scheduling problem (VSP) on a straight line with time window constraints for both path (VSP-WINDOW-SLP) and tour (VSP-WINDOW-SLT) versions are NP-complete. <p> The path and tour versions of the VSP on a straight line with ready time only can be solved in O (n 2 ) and O (n) times respectively, where n is the number of sites <ref> [1] </ref>. The trivial cases of the VSP on a straight line with deadline or handling time only can be solved in O (n) time for both path and tour versions. <p> However, the status of the VSP on a straight line with ready and handling times 15 only (or deadline and handling time) is still open. Psaraftis conjectured they are NP-hard <ref> [1] </ref>. Besides, it remains to examine whether the VSP-WINDOW-SLP and VSP-WINDOW-SLT are strongly NP-hard or not. The status of different single-vehicle scheduling problems on a straight line topological structure is summarized in Table 1. <p> (r) O (n 2 ) y O (n) y deadline (d) O (n) O (n) handling time (h) O (n) O (n) r and d NP-hard NP-hard r and h ? z ? r,d and h NP-hard in NP-hard in the strong sense the strong sense y: By Psaraftis's result <ref> [1] </ref>. z: A ? denotes an unknown status.

Reference-contexts: As a result, the NP-completeness of VSP-WINDOW-SLP (decision) is a stronger result. We are going to show the reduction from PARTITION which is known to be NP-complete <ref> [6] </ref>. PARTITION INSTANCE: A finite set I = f1; 2; : : :; N g, a "size" a i 0 for each i 2 I. <p> An extension to the case in which the vehicle is required to spend a known "service" time (called handling time) at each site is also an interesting problem. It is easily observed that the SEQUENCING WITHIN INTERVALS <ref> [6] </ref>, which is a strongly NP-complete problem, is a restricted case of the VSP on a straight line with time windows and handling time. Thus the extension of VSP-WINDOW-SLP and VSP-WINDOW-SLT with handling time are NP-hard in the strong sense.
