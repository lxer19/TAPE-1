Abstract: Figure 1: The Adept Flex Feeder System. A SCARA robot picks parts off the middle of three conveyors. These three conveyors, along with an elevator bucket, circulate parts; an overhead camera looks down on the back-lit middle conveyor to determine the position and orientation of parts. Abstract This paper explores a sensorless technique for orienting planar parts. We follow an approach described in earlier papers [3, 4] called 1JOC for One Joint Over Conveyor, which can perform planar manipulation using a single controlled joint in combination with a constant-velocity conveyor. Our previous work demonstrated that the 1JOC approach can orient and feed planar polygonal parts, given a singulated part in a known initial location. This paper shows that a variation called the Sensorless 1JOC can orient and feed polygonal parts up to symmetries in the underlying mechanics, without knowing the initial location and without sensors.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper adopts an approach to planar manipulation called 1JOC (One Joint Over Conveyor, pronounced one jock) <ref> [3] </ref>. Initially the approach was conceived as a variation on the Adept Flex Feeder (see Figure 1), which is used to feed parts in automated factories. The Flex Feeder uses a system of conveyors to recirculate parts, presenting them in random orientation to a camera and robotic manipulator. <p> Finally we draw a few conlu-sions (Section 6: Conclusions). 2 Related Work This paper touches on a number of topics, so that an adequate discussion of our intellectual precedents seems impossible in the space available.

Reference-contexts: The resulting system is called the sensorless 1JOC. The main result of the present paper is: The sensorless 1JOC can orient polygons to sym metry in the push function. Goldberg <ref> [14] </ref> demonstrated that a sequence of normal pushes can orient polygons up to symmetries in the push function. We demonstrate a set of sensorless 1JOC actions that implement Goldberg's normal pushes. We begin by tracing some of the intellectual predecessors (Section 2: Related Work). <p> Peshkin and Sanderson [30] used results on the motion of a pushed object to find a sequence of fences to automatically orient a sliding part. Brokowski, Peshkin, and Goldberg [9] designed curved fence sections to eliminate uncertainty in the orientations of parts being oriented by the fences. Goldberg <ref> [14] </ref> developed a backchaining algorithm to orient polygonal parts up to symmetry using a frictionless parallel-jaw gripper. Wiegley et al. [34] developed a complete algorithm to find the shortest sequence of frictionless curved fences to orient a polygonal part. <p> The main argument is to show that we can use the sensorless 1JOC to implement Goldberg's normal push actions <ref> [14] </ref>. It follows that the sensorless 1JOC can orient polygons up to symmetry in the push function. We adopt some conventions to simplify the presentation. We assume an origin at the center of the fence, and we assume the belt's velocity v is in the y direction. <p> Viewed from a frame fixed in the belt, each catch is a linear normal push, meaning that the fence is pushing the part in a direction normal to the fence face. To determine the rotation of the part during a catch, we follow Goldberg <ref> [14] </ref> in using the radius function (Figure 11). The radius of a part is the perpendicular distance from a reference point in the part to a supporting line. <p> Each local minimum in the radius function determines a convergent orientation, and each local maximum determines a divergent orientation. Hence a normal push has the net effect of mapping the entire interval between two divergent orientations to the enclosed convergent orientation. The push function <ref> [14] </ref>, obtained from the radius function, is an alternative representation of the effect of a normal push. It is a mapping p : S 1 ! S 1 from the initial relative orientation of a part to the resulting orientation (Figure 12), and has a period of 2. <p> A compact representation of the push function is shown in 4.2 Plan Existence and Generation The push function is a monotonic step function which wraps around at 2. This means that Goldberg's backchain-ing algorithm <ref> [14] </ref> can be used to find the shortest sequence of fence rotations to orient a part. <p> Orienting a part with n (a) orientation is the perpendicular distance from the center of friction to the fence. (b) The radius function is the plot of the part radius as the fence orientation is varied. Based on <ref> [14] </ref>. vertical axes are the initial and resulting relative orientations of the part. stable edges takes O (n) stages. Further, the algorithm can generate a sequence of rotations to orient any part up to symmetry in its push function. triangle.

Reference-contexts: For example, it is easy to show that all triangles are orientable using the angle range (=2; =2). There exist quadrilaterals, however, that cannot be oriented up to symmetry using this angle range. Goldberg and Overmars <ref> [15] </ref> showed that (=2; =2) is sufficient if parts possess no partial symmetriesthe distances from each stable angle to each edge of its convergence range are unique. 5 Implementation Our implementation of the sensorless 1JOC uses rotation about a fixed pivot point since most parts do not require rotations close to

Reference-contexts: Related research includes dynamic parts orienting on a vibrating plate (Bohringer et al. [8], Swanson et al. [33]). Other forms of nonprehensile manipulation are parts orienting by tray-tilting (Erdmann and Mason [13]), tumbling (Sawasaki et al. <ref> [32] </ref>), pivoting (Aiyama et al. [2]), tapping (Higuchi [17], Huang et al. [19]), two pin manipulation (Abell and Erdmann [1]), and two palm manipulation (Erd-mann [12], Zumel and Erdmann [35]). Much of the work on underactuated manipulation has exploited dynamic coupling among freedoms.

Reference-contexts: Much of this work was inspired by industrial parts feeders such as bowl feeders and the APOS system (Hitakawa [18]). Related research includes dynamic parts orienting on a vibrating plate (Bohringer et al. [8], Swanson et al. <ref> [33] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Brokowski, Peshkin, and Goldberg [9] designed curved fence sections to eliminate uncertainty in the orientations of parts being oriented by the fences. Goldberg [14] developed a backchaining algorithm to orient polygonal parts up to symmetry using a frictionless parallel-jaw gripper. Wiegley et al. <ref> [34] </ref> developed a complete algorithm to find the shortest sequence of frictionless curved fences to orient a polygonal part. Minimalism in robotics has also been studied by Donald et al. [11], Canny and Goldberg [10], and B ohringer et al. [7].

Much of the work on underactuated manipulation has exploited dynamic coupling among freedoms. Research on un-deractuated manipulators includes that of Oriolo and Naka-mura [29] and Arai and Tachi [6]. Arai and Khatib [5] demonstrated rolling of a cube on a paddle held by a PUMA.
