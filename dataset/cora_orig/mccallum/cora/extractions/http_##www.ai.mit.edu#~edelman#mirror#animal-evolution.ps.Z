Reference-contexts: Objects can be created for this purpose using a number of parameters that can be varied by hand <ref> [1] </ref> (e.g. figs. 1, 2), or found by an artificial evolution guided by interactive selection [2]-[4]. However, a better approach to object generation would be to develop algorithms based on autonomous evolution. We have chosen the familiar notion of genetic algorithm as starting point for such an approach [5], [6].

Reference-contexts: However, a better approach to object generation would be to develop algorithms based on autonomous evolution. We have chosen the familiar notion of genetic algorithm as starting point for such an approach <ref> [5] </ref>, [6]. A difficult problem with genetic algorithms is to find the relevant features of the object which should contribute to the fitness function that is only indirectly related to geometry. <p> They are used for finding optima in large search spaces <ref> [5] </ref>. The main idea of a genetic algorithm is to search for the global maximum of a function F the fitness using evolutionary techniques such as those 4 described in the previous section.

Reference-contexts: We arrived at these conclusions trying to capture the intuitive notion of fitness in a simulated evolution required to generate animal or insect-like objects. A similar conclusion seems to be suggested by some recent psychophysical data on human recognition of 3D objects <ref> [7] </ref>, [8]. In Section 2 we give the definitions and explain the main concepts used in the study of evolution. Section 3 provides a brief background in the field of genetic algorithms, and points out the differences between the classical algorithms and the one used in our work.

Reference-contexts: Generally, the selection is non-random and is performed on the phenotype (fig. 2); mutation is usually random and is performed on the corresponding genotypes (e.g. Table 1 from Appendix A). 3 Genetic Algorithms Genetic algorithms were first developed by Holland <ref> [9] </ref> as search techniques based on random variation and selection of a population of test points in a scalar field defined on a highly dimensional space. They are used for finding optima in large search spaces [5].

Reference-contexts: it will be shown latter, in our case the convergence rate can be easily controlled due to the particular form of F . 4 The Thermodynamics of Evolution The science of thermodynamics is concerned with explaining the properties of matter insofar as they are determined by the change in temperature <ref> [10] </ref>. The geometric complexity which describes the stationary states in thermodynamic systems is measured by the entropy S.

Reference-contexts: Starting from these definitions, in <ref> [11] </ref> was shown that if the population reproduction is subjected to mutations where the mutants are described by the asymptotic growth rate r+r and by the fitness H +H, then, under limited resource conditions, F r &gt; 0 : (4.4) This result implies that the mutant invades the population if and
