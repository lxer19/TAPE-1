Note: this Memo This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026. Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Note that other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts. The list of current Internet-Drafts can be accessed at http://www.ietf.org/ietf/1id-abstracts.txt The list of Internet-Draft Shadow Directories can be accessed at http://www.ietf.org/shadow.html.

Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress." Abstract IS-IS may form multiple equal cost paths between points. This is true of any link state protocol. In the absence of any explicit support to take advantage of this, a path may be chosen arbitrarily. Techniques have been utilized to divide traffic somewhat evenly among the available paths. These techniques have been referred to as Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP). An unequal division of traffic among the available paths is generally preferable. Routers generally have no knowledge of traffic loading on distant links and therefore have no basis to optimize the allocation of traffic. Optimized Mulitpath is a extension to IS-IS, utilizing additional Type/Length/Value (TLV) tuples to distribute loading information. An algorithm to adjust forwarding, gradually enough to insure stability yet provide reasonably fast adjustment when needed, is provided in the related document OSPF-OMP [6]. The IS-IS encapsulation and minor differences in the dynamics of ISIS-OMP relative to OSPF-OMP are described here.

Reference-contexts: 1 Overview IS-IS is OSI link state routing protocol [2]. OSPF is a link state routing protocol defined within the IETF process [4]. IS-IS can also be used as an IP interior gateway protocol (IGP) much as OSPF is used <ref> [1] </ref>. Networks are often heavily loaded. Topologies often evolve to include multiple paths. Multiple paths may be initially designed to provide redundancy but also result from incremental addition of circuits to accommodate traffic growth. The redundant paths provide a potential to distribute traffic loading and reduce congestion.

Reference-contexts: The type and length are one byte each. The length is a unsigned byte providing the length in bytes of the Value portion of the tuple. The "extended IS reachability TLV" is defined by Li as type 22 <ref> [3] </ref>. Subtypes of this TLV include the following, however if there are any differences in a descendant to [3], consider that list to be authoritative. <p> The length is a unsigned byte providing the length in bytes of the Value portion of the tuple.

The technique of equal cost multipath (ECMP) routing is formally defined in OSPF <ref> [4] </ref> but has also been applied to IS-IS implementations. Because these routing protocols are quite similar, application of OMP techniques is very similar. Differences between OSPF and IS-IS that impact OMP are: 1.

Reference-contexts: Villamizar, Li Expires August 22, 1999 [Page 4] INTERNET-DRAFT IS-IS Optimized Multipath (ISIS-OMP) February 22, 1999 Generally ISIS is not used to carry exterior routing information. Instead, a separate exterior gateway protocol is used, specifically BGP-4 <ref> [5] </ref>. When BGP-4 is used to carry external routes within an AS (this is referred to as Internal BGP or IBGP), IS-IS is used strictly as an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP).
