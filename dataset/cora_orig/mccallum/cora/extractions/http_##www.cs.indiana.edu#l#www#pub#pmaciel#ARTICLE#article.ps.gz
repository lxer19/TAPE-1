Title: Visual Navigation of Large Environments Using Textured Clusters  
Author: Paulo W. C. Maciel Peter Shirley 
Abstract: A visual navigation system is described which uses texture mapped primitives to represent clusters of objects to maintain high and approximately constant frame rates. In cases where there are more unoccluded primitives inside the viewing frustum than can be drawn in real-time on the workstation, this system ensures that each visible object, or a cluster that includes it, is drawn in each frame. The system supports the use of traditional "level-of-detail" representations for individual objects, and supports the automatic generation of a certain type of level-of-detail for objects and clusters of objects. The concept of choosing a representation from among those associated with an object that accounts for the direction from which the object is viewed is also supported. The level-of-detail concept is extended to the whole model and the entire scene is stored as a hierarchy of levels-of-detail that is traversed top-down to find a good representation for a given viewpoint. This system does not assume that visibility information can be extracted from the model and is thus especially suited for outdoor environments.

Reference-contexts: The best approach so far to solve this problem attempts to predict the complexity of the scene at the current frame and selects impostors accordingly and is described by Funkhouser and Sequin <ref> [3] </ref>. The system described in this paper can be viewed as an extension of Funkhouser and Sequin's system with the following new properties: * The entire database is a single hierarchy which contains drawable impostors (including LODs) for objects as well as clusters of objects.

Reference-contexts: This texture map is called a textured cluster when it corresponds to an image of a group of objects. * Another view dependent texture map is also known as billboard in <ref> [6] </ref> and is obtained in the same way as texture maps. A billboard is centered at an object's center and made to rotate in such a way that it always face the observer. <p> In a pre-processing phase, associate to each texture map a number corresponding to the region it belongs as in 1 It can be used in machines that do not have texture mapping hardware. 2 Some toolkits such as Performer <ref> [6] </ref> provide routines to auto matically generate coarse versions of a given full-detail object. 2. During the walkthrough we determine the viewpoint with respect to the object's coordinate system and therefore the region it is in. In some situations, both a view dependent and a view independent representation are suitable.

Reference-contexts: Therefore we conclude that to determine the benefit of an object in some cases is undecidable without knowing what surrounds it. As pointed out by Gestalt Psychologists <ref> [7] </ref>, the meaning conveyed by an object may be more than merely the "addition" of the meanings conveyed by each one of the objects alone, that is, the whole conveys more information then the sum of its parts.

Reference-contexts: These programs are implemented in C++, use GL <ref> [8] </ref> for rendering, and have an X-Motif GUI to facilitate parameter changes for system evaluation. 5.1 Model Hierarchy Building and Representa tion Generation The program that builds the model hierarchy implements the hierarchy building algorithm described in section 4.4 and opens two windows, as shown in Figure B.

Reference-contexts: The real time graph show spikes due to random interrupts and a gap with respect to the 1=30 line due to smooth LOD switching using transparency blending. These interrupts can be minimized by mechanisms such as processor isolation, interrupts redirection, processor locking and so on as described in <ref> [9] </ref>. The same model, without the model hierarchy, takes around 1 frame per second for certain viewpoints in our test path. 6 Limitations One limitation of this system is the number of texture maps that can be used to represent objects and clusters.
