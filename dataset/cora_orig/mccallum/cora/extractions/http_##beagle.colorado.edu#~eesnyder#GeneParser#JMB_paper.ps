Reference-contexts: Thus, this statistic is similar to the IF-hexamer test except that the log-likelihood is summed over all reading frames and that each sequence class is compared to its own hexamer frequency table. BLAST Similarity Scores The program BLAST <ref> (Altschul et al., 1990) </ref> has become a very popular tool for identifying regions of similarity between a query sequence and sequences in the protein or nucleotide sequence databases.

Reference-contexts: We present here a dynamic programming algorithm which can parse a sequence into an arbitrary number of classes subject to a number of "grammatical" constraints. This method is similar in spirit to DP methods for speech segmentation developed by (Cohen, 1981) and <ref> (Bridle & Sedgwick, 1977) </ref>. However, since biological sequences consist of intrinsically discrete elements, the problem of parsing can be mapped more naturally into a DP algorithm.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, the ends of introns (donor and acceptor splice sites) are characterized by specific sequence motifs which can be searched for directly by consensus sequence or weight matrix (Stormo, 1988; Stormo, 1990) or neural network <ref> (Brunak et al., 1991) </ref>. However, even the best of these methods still predict many more false sites than true sites (Brunak et al., 1991). <p> (donor and acceptor splice sites) are characterized by specific sequence motifs which can be searched for directly by consensus sequence or weight matrix (Stormo, 1988; Stormo, 1990) or neural network <ref> (Brunak et al., 1991) </ref>. However, even the best of these methods still predict many more false sites than true sites (Brunak et al., 1991). Because of the limitations of the individual statistics, several groups have developed gene 3 identification programs or algorithms which combine multiple pieces of evidence into a single framework. <p> To facilitate the comparison of methods, we use three measures of performance: sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), and the correlation coefficient (CC) 23 <ref> (Brunak et al., 1991) </ref>. Table 4 illustrates how each of these scores is calculated.

Reference-contexts: The results were processed to filter alignments to the query sequence as well as to translated Alu sequences. The filters SEG (Wootton & Federhen, 1993) and XNU <ref> (Claverie & States, 1993) </ref> were also applied to minimize the matches to sequences of low compositional complexity or short periodicity repeats, respectively. 11 (ii) Site Statistics In the present study, splice sites and translational initiation sites need to be discriminated from non-sites in the context of the genomic DNA sequence.

While these methods give a rough indication of the location of exons in a sequence, the boundaries are not well defined.

Reference-contexts: A BLASTX search takes a DNA sequence and translates all open reading frames for use in a search of peptide sequence databases <ref> (Gish & States, 1993) </ref>. A genomic DNA sequence will generate a list of proteins to which the query sequence has similarity (assuming such sequences exist) along with a maximal-segment pair (MSP) score which evaluates the significance of the alignment.

Reference-contexts: However, recent experience with large-scale sequencing in yeast (Koonin et al., 1994) and Caenorhabditis elegans (Wilson et al., 1994) suggests that only a fraction of genes have identifiable homologs in the current literature. Furthermore, there is evidence from the study of ancient conserved regions <ref> (Green et al., 1993) </ref> that the fraction of sequences with inter-phylum homology is unlikely to increase beyond about 40-50% as more sequences are accumulated because most of these motifs have already been identified.

Reference-contexts: These facts led to the codon usage statistic developed by Staden (Staden & McLachlan, 1982) and modified by Gribskov <ref> (Gribskov & Burgess, 1984) </ref>. These tests compare the frequencies of three-long words in a sequence to frequencies seen in coding regions. A contextual effect on codon usage has also been observed which manifests itself as correlations between nucleotide positions in adjacent codons (Lipman & Wilbur, 1983; Yarus & Foley, 1985).

Because of the limitations of the individual statistics, several groups have developed gene 3 identification programs or algorithms which combine multiple pieces of evidence into a single framework. GeneID <ref> (Guigo et al., 1992) </ref> and GeneModeler (Fields & Soderlund, 1990; Soderlund et al., 1992) identify candidate exons which satisfy certain criteria and then use heuristic, rule-based approaches to assembling these exons to make predictions of gene structure. <p> This resulted in a collection of 333 loci (Snyder, 1994) 5 . Hexamer tables and weight matrices were calculated based on these sequences. Some authors have taken pains to remove or down-weight related sequences from their sequence pool <ref> (Guigo et al., 1992) </ref>. We have chosen not to do this because such redundancies are likely to reflect the types of genes to be sequenced in the future.

(ii) Training Set The training set for the program GeneID (Guigo et al., 1992) serves as the starting point for the GeneParser training sets. The GeneID training set consists of 169 vertebrate genes for which both mRNA and genomic sequence are known and that possess at least one internal exon. <p> Three version of GeneParser were tested: GeneParser1, trained on the entire Training Set; GeneParser2, trained with separate networks for differing G+C contents; GeneParser3, like GeneParser2 but also including the BLAST statistic. For comparison purposes, the email server versions of GeneID <ref> (Guigo et al., 1992) </ref> and GRAIL2 (Uberbacher & Mural, 1991) were used to evaluate the performance of these programs on the Test Sets. GRAIL3 (GRAIL2 + exon assembly routines) was tested manually using the interactive client server XGRAIL (Xu et al., 1994a; Xu et al., 1994b).

Such information can be displayed for all of the statistics discussed in this section. Intron and Exon Length Distributions Introns and exons have very different extreme and average lengths <ref> (Hawkins, 1988) </ref>. Even within the class of exons 2 , the length distributions of 3 0 -, 5 0 and internal exons all differ significantly from one another ( p &lt; 0:001 by 2 test ).

Reference-contexts: Local Compositional Complexity Eukaryotic genomes contain large amounts of repetitive DNA sequences referred to as "simple sequence" DNA. These sequences are typically found in noncoding regions of the genome. In contrast, coding regions tend to be informationally rich. This property, quantified by the Shannon information <ref> (Shannon & Weaver, 1964) </ref>, is a measure of the local redundancy of the sequence. Konopka and Owens (Konopka & Owens, 1990) have defined local compositional complexity averaged over the length of the sequence and have used this property to distinguish between coding and non-coding sequences.

Reference-contexts: A region of about 20 nucleotides on either side of the 12 splice site was examined. Based on the work of Shapiro and Senapathy <ref> (Shapiro & Senapathy, 1987) </ref>, a subset of each matrix was extracted and used for searching. A similar procedure was used to examine the context of translational initiation and termination sites.

Reference-contexts: This is sensible since it is very unlikely that the input sequence will exactly span the gene found within. This is analogous to the use of zero to initialize the DP matrix in the local alignment algorithm of Smith and Waterman <ref> (Smith & Waterman, 1981) </ref>. (i) Suboptimal Solutions Using this approach, there are two possible methods to generate suboptimal solutions. First, the score for each interval in the optimal solution (one at a time) can be set to 1 and the DP step re-run.

Reference-contexts: In addition to sequence similarity, there are numerous types of evidence which can be applied to this problem (see review by <ref> (Stormo, 1987) </ref>). Content statistics that measure properties of long stretches of sequence help to distinguish exons from other sequence types. Looking for open reading frames and codon usage bias are classic methods but many others have been developed in recent years (for a review, see (Fickett & Tung, 1992)). <p> Methods (a) Statistical Tests to Identify Coding Regions All gene assembly programs available today make use of multiple lines of evidence from which to draw conclusions about the positions of coding exons in a genomic sequence. This information can take two forms: search by content and search by signal <ref> (Stormo, 1987) </ref>. Content statistics measure bulk properties of a length of sequence while signal based methods look for short conserved sequence elements. Some of these statistics require reference to information derived 6 from a sample of known sequences.

Reference-contexts: From this information, the elements of a frequency matrix, f b;i = n b;i =N can be calculated, where N is the total number of sites in the sample. The search matrix <ref> (Stormo, 1990) </ref> is calculated as M b;i = log 2 (f b;i =p b ) where p b is the a priori frequency of base b. This frequency can be either the genomic base frequency or the local frequency, depending on the model of interest. <p> The score for a query sequence using the search matrix represents the log-likelihood ratio that the query is a member of the matrix set compared to the random genomic population under the assumptions of additivity and independence between positions. The information content <ref> (Stormo, 1990) </ref> of the site is the dot product of frequency matrix and the search matrix and gives a measure of the importance or conservation of each position in the site.

Reference-contexts: GenLang uses formal language theory and generative grammars to model the structure of tRNAs (Searls & Dong, 1993) as well as protein-coding genes (Searls, 1993). Probably the best known is GRAIL <ref> (Uberbacher & Mural, 1991) </ref> which uses a neural network to combine content statistics and make predictions on whether a window of sequence is coding or non-coding. Other methods such as cluster analysis are used to define the boundaries of the exons and assemble them into complete genes. <p> Three version of GeneParser were tested: GeneParser1, trained on the entire Training Set; GeneParser2, trained with separate networks for differing G+C contents; GeneParser3, like GeneParser2 but also including the BLAST statistic. For comparison purposes, the email server versions of GeneID (Guigo et al., 1992) and GRAIL2 <ref> (Uberbacher & Mural, 1991) </ref> were used to evaluate the performance of these programs on the Test Sets. GRAIL3 (GRAIL2 + exon assembly routines) was tested manually using the interactive client server XGRAIL (Xu et al., 1994a; Xu et al., 1994b).

Reference-contexts: For training GeneParser, the remaining 59 human genes were extracted and will be referred to as the Training 5 These loci names are available by anonymous ftp from beagle.colorado.edu in the file pub/GeneParser/JMB loci.Z 21 Set. These genes are listed in Table 1. We observe here and others report <ref> (Uberbacher & Mural, 1993) </ref> that the performance of many gene identification programs is sensitive to G+C content.

Reference-contexts: In training the simplest network (with 40 weights and biases), the number of patterns exceeds the number of free parameters after a few iterations. Introducing hidden layers into the network increases the number of free parameters (to 276 for the network used in Figure 6). Widrow's heuristic <ref> (Widrow & Walach, 1984) </ref>, which relates network complexity to training set size, suggests that nearly 10 4 training examples would be required before good generalization could be expected from this network.

Reference-contexts: One approach is to search for homologous sequences in databases such as GenBank. However, recent experience with large-scale sequencing in yeast (Koonin et al., 1994) and Caenorhabditis elegans <ref> (Wilson et al., 1994) </ref> suggests that only a fraction of genes have identifiable homologs in the current literature.

Reference-contexts: To this end, test and training sequences were run using the BLAST email server running the BLASTX program (database freeze date: Feb. 1, 1993). The results were processed to filter alignments to the query sequence as well as to translated Alu sequences. The filters SEG <ref> (Wootton & Federhen, 1993) </ref> and XNU (Claverie & States, 1993) were also applied to minimize the matches to sequences of low compositional complexity or short periodicity repeats, respectively. 11 (ii) Site Statistics In the present study, splice sites and translational initiation sites need to be discriminated from non-sites in the context

Reference-contexts: For example, a new GRAIL implementation utilizes dynamic programming to find optimal solutions from a limited number of candidate exons <ref> (Xu et al., 1994a) </ref>. The implementation of GeneParser is flexible to allow additional statistics to be easily added to the system. Potential additional statistics include branch point recognition and recognizers of intron-specific sequences such as Alu repetitive elements. The approach can also be generalized easily to more sequence types.

Reference-contexts: Recently, others have applied DP to gene parsing, including (Gelfand & Roytberg, 1993) and <ref> (Xu et al., 1994b) </ref>. Knight and Myers (Knight & Meyers, 1995) have developed a "super pattern matching" algorithm that uses DP to parse biological sequences into domains of different classes, even allowing those domains to overlap.
