Title: Almost all graphs with 2:522n edges are not 3-colorable  
Author: Dimitris Achlioptas Michael Molloy

Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of  
Abstract: We show that a random graph on n vertices with m = rn edges is almost surely not 3-colorable, if r 2:522. This follows from a refinement of the first moment argument for almost sure k-non-colorability that we present, and we give similar bounds for small values of k.

Reference-contexts: Using the main theorem of [5], Friedgut and the first author <ref> [1] </ref> showed that for all k 3, there exists a function r k = r k (n), such that (1) holds. While it is widely believed that lim n!1 r k (n) exists, determining this limit (r k ), even for k = 3, seems very challenging. <p> It is not hard to show, by induction on n, that for each value of n f is concave in this domain. Hence, if we relax each ff i to an arbitraty rational in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> the resulting function g (ff 1 ; ; ff k ) is also concave, subject to i=1 ff i = 1. Now, maximizing g can be done numerically with arbitrarily good (guaranteed) precision.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The term "almost all" in the title has the meaning introduced by Erdos and Renyi <ref> [4] </ref>: if N (n; m; A) stands for the number of graphs with vertices f1; : : :; ng, precisely m edges, and some property A, saying that almost all graphs with n vertices and m = m (n) edges have property A, means that lim N (n; m (n); A) <p> This is the G (n; m) model of random graphs. We will say a sequence of events E n holds almost surely (a.s.) if lim n!1 Pr [E n ] = 1. Erdos and Renyi <ref> [4] </ref> pointed out the existence of threshold phenomena in G (n; m): for many interesting properties A, the probability G (n; m) has A exhibits a sharp change at a certain critical value of m.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we first go over the (first moment) argument that enables the known upper bounds for r k and then show how the main idea of <ref> [6] </ref>, developed for random k-SAT, can be seen as a refinement of this argument, yielding an improved upper bound for r k . y Authors' address: Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S 3G4. <p> If one views the set of all k-partitions as the n-dimensional k-ary cube f1; : : :; kg n then the above argument suggests that when k-colorings exist, they tend to appear in large "clusters". The main idea of <ref> [6] </ref>, when translated to k-coloring, amounts to examining the expectation of only those k-colorings that satisfy some "local maximality" condition. <p> Similarly, we get k 3 4 5 6 7 First moment method 2.7096 4.8188 7.2126 9.8275 12.6234 New bound 2.5217 4.5861 6.9479 9.5389 12.3160 Acknowledgements We would like to thank the authors of <ref> [6] </ref> for providing us with an early draft of their paper and the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada for financial support.

Reference-contexts: If m = rn, where r &gt; ln k ln kln (k1) , this expectation tends to 0 as n tends to infinity and, thus, so does the probability that G is k-colorable. This argument yields r 3 2:71 and in general r k k ln k. Luczak <ref> [7] </ref> proved that, for k sufficiently large, a random graph with rn edges, where r = (1 o (1))k ln k, is a.s. k-colorable, hence showing that this argument is asymptotically tight.
