Abstract: M.I.T. Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 201, May 1993 Portions of this report initially appeared in the Proceedings of ICCV93. Abstract We describe a new method for establishing correspondence, computing canonical descriptions, and recognizing objects that is based on the idea of describing objects by their generalized symmetries, as defined by the object's vibration or deformation modes. The resulting modal description is useful for object classification, where object similarities are computed in terms of the amounts of modal deformation energy needed to align the two objects. In general, modes provide a global-to-local ordering of shape deformation which allows us to select which types of deformations are to be used in object alignment and comparison. In contrast to previous methods [14, 30, 17] we are able to compute the object's deformation modes directly from available image information, rather than requiring the computation of correspondence with an initial or prototype shape. This results in greater generality and accuracy, and is applicable to data of any dimensionality.

Reference-contexts: The stable computation of such a coordinate frame is the key contribution of this paper. Many methods for finding a body-centered frame have been suggested, including moment-of-inertia methods, symmetry finders, and polar Fourier descriptors (for a review see <ref> [1] </ref>). These methods generally suffer from three difficulties: sampling error, parameterization error, and nonuniqueness. Sampling error is the best understood of these three. Everyone in vision knows that which features you see and their location can change drastically from view to view.

Stiffness and mass matrices K and M are precomputed for a simple, rectangular isoparametric element, and then this simple element is repeatedly warped and copied to tessellate the region of interest. <p> By discarding affinities greater than a certain threshold, we allow for tokens which have no strong match. Second, as described earlier, only the low-order twenty-five percent of the eigenvectors are employed, as the higher-order modes are known to be noise-sensitive and thus unstable <ref> [2] </ref>. And finally, because of the reduced basis matching, similarity of the generalized features is required in both directions, instead of one direction only.

Reference-contexts: In but not the most natural given our knowledge of human bone structure. In our final example, Figure 8, we use outlines of three different types of airplanes as seen from a variety of different viewpoints (adapted from <ref> [34] </ref>). In the first three cases the descriptions generated are quite similar, and as a consequence a very good correspondence is obtained. Again, only two percent of the correspondences are shown. In the last pair, the wing position of the two planes is quite different.
