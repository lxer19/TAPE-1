Abstract: This work focuses on the inference of evolutionary relationships in protein superfamilies, and the uses of these relationships to identify key positions in the structure, to infer attributes on the basis of evolutionary distance, and to identify potential errors in sequence annotations. Relative entropy, a distance metric from information theory, is used in combination with Dirichlet mixture priors to estimate a phylogenetic tree for a set of proteins. This method infers key structural or functional positions in the molecule, and guides the tree topology to preserve these important positions within subtrees. Minimum-description-length principles are used to determine a cut of the tree into subtrees, to identify the sub-families in the data. This method is demonstrated on SH2-domain containing proteins, resulting in a new subfamily assignment for Src2 drome and a suggested evolutionary relationship between Nck human and Drk drome, Sem5 caeel, Grb2 human and Grb2 chick.

Reference-contexts: Because of this, during the agglomeration process, as increasingly divergent sequences are added to the classes being formed, conserved positions start to become evident in the profiles being formed. The distance measure between profiles employed in this method is a symmetrized form of relative entropy <ref> (Cover and Thomas 1991) </ref>, summed over all the columns in the multiple alignment.

Reference-contexts: Proofs of statistical consistency only exist for a limited range of models of evolution, and most assume that the sites evolve under identical processes <ref> (Erdos et al. 1997) </ref>. On the other hand, performance under non-identical evolutionary processes (i.e., allowing rates across sites to vary) can still be quite good for some methods under some experimental conditions (Tateno et al. 1994; Felsenstein 1996; Hasegawa et al. 1991; Yang 1994; Kuhner and Felsenstein 1994).

Reference-contexts: Experiment 1: SH2 domain subfamily identification and analysis In the first experiment, I constructed phylogenetic trees on all 99 taxa in the alignment, using Bayesian Evolutionary Tree Estimation (B^ete), Neighbor-joining from the PHYLIP package <ref> (Felsenstein 1997) </ref>, and Star Decomposition from the MOLPHY suite (Hasegawa and Adachi 1997). Whereas much of the fine-branching tree topologies (tree structure for closely related sequences) were consistent across the different methods, there were disagreements on the coarse-branching order relating whole subtrees, particularly between Star Decomposition and B^ete. <p> The multiple alignment of these proteins was extracted from the larger alignment, and used as the basis for estimating trees using Star Decomposition and Maximum Likelihood from the MOLPHY software suite (Hasegawa and Adachi 1997), Neighbor Joining and Parsimony from the PHYLIP software suite <ref> (Felsenstein 1997) </ref>, and B^ete. Because Maximum Likelihood examines all tree topologies (a quantity that grows exponentially in the number of sequences), a subset of only 11 sequences were used in the ML analysis. For comparison purposes, the same subset was used in the Parsimony analysis.

Star Decomposition software was obtained from the MOLPHY software suite <ref> (Hasegawa and Adachi 1997) </ref> Conclusions A novel method for estimating phylogenetic trees on protein superfamilies, incorporating Bayesian and information-theoretic methods, has been presented. This method identifies, from the primary sequence alone, residues that are conserved within subfamilies for functional or structural reasons, and drives the tree topology Fig. 3. <p> For computational reasons, only 11 sequences were used to estimate this tree topology. The program used came from the MOLPHY suite <ref> (Hasegawa and Adachi 1997) </ref>. idation. This method resulted in a change in the Swis-sProt annotation for Src2 drome, and suggests a new subfamily classification for Nck human.

Reference-contexts: In addition to similarities at these binding pockets, there are functional similarities among these proteins. Grb2, Nck and Drk are all noted as being adaptor proteins; all bind to growth factor receptors, and are involved in RAS activation <ref> (Lu et al. 1997) </ref>. Examination of the multiple of alignment of Nck with other members of this subfamily revealed two regions where minor hand-editing would improve the pairwise residue identities at non-binding pocket positions (see between Nck and Drk to 48%.

Reference-contexts: Two aspects of the method differentiate it from standard neighbor-joining tree algorithms: the representation of each class at each iteration of the algorithm, and the distance measure between classes used to choose which two classes to join. Classes are represented by profiles, employing Dirich-let mixture priors <ref> (Sjolander et al. 1996) </ref> to compute the amino acid distributions at each position. Dirichlet mixture priors have been found to be highly effective at increasing the sensitivity and specificity of remote homolog identification (Karplus et al. 1997; Tatusov et al. 1994; Bailey and Elkan 1995; Brown et al. 1993).
