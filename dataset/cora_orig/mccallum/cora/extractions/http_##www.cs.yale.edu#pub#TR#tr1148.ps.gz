Reference-contexts: A well-known approach to solve this problem consists of transforming it into the equivalent problem of finding a maximum clique in an auxiliary graph structure, known as the association graph [2, 3]. The idea goes back to Ambler et al. <ref> [1] </ref>, and has since been successfully employed in a variety of different problems, e.g., [5, 13, 21, 29, 28, 34, 36]. This framework is attractive because it casts relational structure matching as a pure graph-theoretic problem, for which a solid theory and powerful algorithms have been developed.

Reference-contexts: The following theorem, recently proved by Bomze <ref> [6] </ref>, expands on the Motzkin-Straus theorem [20], a remarkable result which establishes a connection between the maximum clique problem and certain standard quadratic programs. This has an intriguing computational significance in that it allows us to shift from the discrete to the continuous domain in an elegant manner. Theorem 2.

The ability of shock trees to discriminate between classes of shapes, using both their topologies as well as metric/label information has been examined in <ref> [33] </ref>. Here we address the unlabeled version of the problem, and examine matching based on topology alone. We stress that our goal is to illustrate the power of the hierarchical structure matching algorithm. <p> It is evident that such a structural matching process for indexing into a database of shapes has great potential; with the addition of geometric information performance can only improve. 8 Fig. 2. An illustrative example of the shocks obtained from curve evolution (from <ref> [33] </ref>). Top: The notation associated with the locus of shock points is of the form shock type-identifier. Bottom: The tree has the shock type on each node, and the identifier is adjacent.

Reference-contexts: The idea goes back to Ambler et al. [1], and has since been successfully employed in a variety of different problems, e.g., <ref> [5, 13, 21, 29, 28, 34, 36] </ref>. This framework is attractive because it casts relational structure matching as a pure graph-theoretic problem, for which a solid theory and powerful algorithms have been developed.

Reference-contexts: To (approximately) solve it we employ replicator equations, a class of simple continuous- and discrete-time dynamical systems developed and studied in various branches of biomathematics <ref> [12, 35] </ref>. We illustrate the power of the approach via several examples of matching articulated and deformed shapes described by shock trees [33]. Fig. 1. An example of matching two trees. <p> Finally, a vector x 2 S n is asymptotically stable under (4) and (5) if and only if x is a strict local maximizer of x 0 W x on S n . The previous result is known in mathematical biology as the Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection <ref> [8, 12, 35] </ref> and, in its original form, traces back to Fisher [9]. As far as the discrete-time model is concerned, it can be regarded as a straightforward implication of the more general Baum-Eagon theorem [4].

Reference-contexts: Although the maximum clique problem is known to be N P -complete [10], powerful heuristics have been developed which efficiently find good approximate solutions [22]. In many computer vision problems, however, relational structures are organized in a hierarchical manner, i.e., are trees (see, for example, <ref> [17, 30, 32, 33, 37] </ref>). Since in the standard association graph formulation the solutions are not constrained to preserve the required partial order, it is not clear how to apply the framework in these cases. The extension of association graph techniques to tree matching problems is therefore of considerable interest.
