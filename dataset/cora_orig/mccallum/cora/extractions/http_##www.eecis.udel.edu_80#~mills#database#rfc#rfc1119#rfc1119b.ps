Reference-contexts: In 1967 the standard second was redefined as 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium-133 atom <ref> [1] </ref>. Since 1972 the time and frequency standards of the world have been based on International Atomic Time (TAI), which is defined in terms of the standard second and currently maintained using multiple cesium-beam clocks to an accuracy of a few parts in 10 13 . <p> For the most precise coordination and timestamping of events since 1972, it is necessary to know when leap seconds are implemented in UTC and how the seconds are numbered. As specified in CCIR Report 517, which is reproduced in <ref> [1] </ref>, a leap second is inserted following second 23:59:59 on the last day of June or December and becomes second 23:59:60 of that day. A leap second would be deleted by omitting second 23:59:59 on one of these days, although this has never happened. <p> While these transmissions and those of Canada (CHU) and other countries can be received over large areas in the western hemisphere, reliable frequency comparisons can be made only to the order of 10 -7 and time accuracies are limited to the order of a millisecond <ref> [1] </ref>. A second service operated by NIST is the low-frequency (LF or CCIR band 5) transmissions on 60 kHz from Boulder, CO (WWVB), which can be received over the continental U.S. and adjacent coastal areas. <p> With appropriate receiving and averaging techniques and corrections for diurnal and seasonal propagation effects, frequency comparisons to within 10 -11 are possible and time accuracies of from a few to 50 microseconds can be obtained <ref> [1] </ref>. However, there is only one station and it operates at modest power levels. The third service operated by NIST uses ultra-high frequency (UHF or CCIR band 9) transmissions on 468 MHz from the Geosynchronous Orbiting Environmental Satellite (GOES).

Reference-contexts: There is some speculation on the continued operation of GOES, especially if the LORAN-C [16] and Global Positioning System (GPS) [17] radiopositioning systems operated by other U.S. agencies continue to evolve as expected. While RFC-1119 Network Time Protocol September 1989 Mills Page 10 the OMEGA <ref> [3] </ref> radionavigation system operated by the U.S. Navy and other countries can in principle provide worldwide frequency and time distribution, this system is unlikely to long survive the operational deployment of GPS.

The particular choice of offset measurement and computation procedure described in Section 3 is a variant of the returnable-time system used in some digital telephone networks [6]. The clock filter and selection algorithms are designed so that the clock synchronization subnet self-organizes into a hierarchical-master-slave configuration [8]. <p> As the stratum increases from one, the singlesample accuracies achievable will degrade depending on the network paths and local-clock stabilities. In order to avoid the tedious calculations <ref> [7] </ref> necessary to estimate errors in each specific configuration, it is useful to assume the measurement errors accumulate approximately in proportion to the total roundtrip path delay to the root of the synchronization subnet, which is called the synchronizing distance.

Reference-contexts: Following conventions established by the telephone industry <ref> [34] </ref>, the accuracy of each server is defined by a number called its stratum, with the topmost level (primary servers) assigned as one and each level downwards (secondary servers) in the hierarchy assigned as one greater than the preceding level. <p> This method amounts to a continuously sampled, returnable-time system, which is used in some digital telephone networks <ref> [34] </ref>. Among the advantages are that the order and timing of the messages is unimportant and that reliable delivery is not required.

Reference-contexts: As the telephone networks of the world are evolving rapidly to digital technology, consideration should be given to the methods used for frequency synchronization in digital networks. The industry has agreed on a classification of clock oscillators as a function of minimum accuracy, minimum stability and other factors <ref> [36] </ref>. There are three factors which determine the classification: stability, jitter and wander. Stability refers to the systematic variation of frequency with time and is synonymous with aging, drift, trends, etc.

Reference-contexts: An additional factor is that each increment in stratum involves a potentially unreliable time server which introduces additional measurement errors. The selection algorithm used in NTP uses a variant of the Bellman-Ford distributed routing algorithm <ref> [37] </ref> to compute the minimum-weight spanning trees rooted on the primary servers. With the foregoing factors in mind, the distance metric was chosen using the stratum number as the high-order bits and synchronizing distance as the low-order bits.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction This document constitutes a formal specification of the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is used to synchronize timekeeping among a set of distributed time servers and clients. It defines the architectures, algorithms, entities and protocols used by NTP and is intended primarily for implementors. A companion document <ref> [44] </ref> summarizes the requirements, analytical models, algorithmic analysis and performance under typical Internet conditions. NTP was first described in RFC-958 [30], but has evolved in significant ways, culminating in the most recent NTP Version 1 described in RFC-1059 [42]. <p> Experimental results on measured times and roundtrip delays in the Internet are discussed in [20], [29], [41] and [42]. Other synchronization algorithms are discussed in [4], [22], [23], [24], [25], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [33], [35], [38], [39], [40], [42] and <ref> [44] </ref>, while protocols based on them are described in [11], [12], [21], [26], [30], [35], [42] and [44]. NTP uses techniques evolved from them and both linear-systems and agreement methodologies. <p> Other synchronization algorithms are discussed in [4], [22], [23], [24], [25], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [33], [35], [38], [39], [40], [42] and <ref> [44] </ref>, while protocols based on them are described in [11], [12], [21], [26], [30], [35], [42] and [44]. NTP uses techniques evolved from them and both linear-systems and agreement methodologies. Linear methods for digital telephone network synchronization are summarized in [6], while agreement methods for clock synchronization are summarized in [25]. The Fuzzball routing protocol [21], sometimes called Hellospeak, incorporates time synchronization directly into the routing-protocol design. <p> Obviously, the accuracies achievable depend upon the statistical properties of the outbound and inbound data paths. Further analysis and experimental results bearing on this issue can be found in <ref> [44] </ref>. In systems involving highspeed LANs, it may happen that, due to small differences in frequency and precision between the host and peer clocks, the delay d i may appear to be not greater than zero (possibly negative). <p> While these algorithms are believed the best available at the present time, they are not an integral part of the NTP specification. A comprehensive discussion of the design principles and performance is given in <ref> [44] </ref>. <p> For each i (0 i &lt; m ) compute the dispersion d i of the list relative to i : RFC-1119 Network Time Protocol September 1989 Mills Page 33 d i = m - 1 where v &lt; 1 is a weighting factor experimentally adjusted for the desired characteristic (see <ref> [44] </ref>). Note that d i represents the actual dispersion of the i th candidate, while the skew d i represents a dispersion limit below which increased accuracy is doubtful and increased wander is likely.

Reference-contexts: Again drawing from the experience of the telephone industry, which learned such lessons at considerable cost <ref> [45] </ref>, the synchronization subnet should be organized to produce the highest accuracy, but must never be allowed to form a loop, regardless of synchronizing distance. An additional factor is that each increment in stratum involves a potentially unreliable time server which introduces additional measurement errors.




Reference: 1. <editor> Version 1 supports no modes other than symmetric-active and symmetric-passive, </editor> <title> which are determined by inspecting the port-number fields of the UDP packet header as described in Section 3.3 above. The low-order three bits of the first octet, specified as zero in Version 1, are used for the mode field in Version 2. Version-2 implementations interoperating with Version-1 implementations should operate in a passive mode only and use the value one in the version number (pkt.version) field and zero in the mode (pkt.mode) field in transmitted messages. </title>
Reference-contexts: In 1967 the standard second was redefined as 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium-133 atom <ref> [1] </ref>. Since 1972 the time and frequency standards of the world have been based on International Atomic Time (TAI), which is defined in terms of the standard second and currently maintained using multiple cesium-beam clocks to an accuracy of a few parts in 10 13 . <p> For the most precise coordination and timestamping of events since 1972, it is necessary to know when leap seconds are implemented in UTC and how the seconds are numbered. As specified in CCIR Report 517, which is reproduced in <ref> [1] </ref>, a leap second is inserted following second 23:59:59 on the last day of June or December and becomes second 23:59:60 of that day. A leap second would be deleted by omitting second 23:59:59 on one of these days, although this has never happened. <p> While these transmissions and those of Canada (CHU) and other countries can be received over large areas in the western hemisphere, reliable frequency comparisons can be made only to the order of 10 -7 and time accuracies are limited to the order of a millisecond <ref> [1] </ref>. A second service operated by NIST is the low-frequency (LF or CCIR band 5) transmissions on 60 kHz from Boulder, CO (WWVB), which can be received over the continental U.S. and adjacent coastal areas. <p> With appropriate receiving and averaging techniques and corrections for diurnal and seasonal propagation effects, frequency comparisons to within 10 -11 are possible and time accuracies of from a few to 50 microseconds can be obtained <ref> [1] </ref>. However, there is only one station and it operates at modest power levels. The third service operated by NIST uses ultra-high frequency (UHF or CCIR band 9) transmissions on 468 MHz from the Geosynchronous Orbiting Environmental Satellite (GOES).
