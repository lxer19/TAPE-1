Title: Planar Map Graphs (Extended Abstract for 1998 STOC)  
Author: Zhi-Zhong Chen, Michelangelo Grigni, and Christos H. Papadimitriou 
Abstract: We introduce and study a modified notion of planarity, in which two regions of a map are considered adjacent when they share any point of their boundaries (not an edge, as standard planarity requires). We seek to characterize the abstract graphs realized by such map adjacencies. We prove some preliminary properties of such graphs, and give a polynomial time algorithm for the following restricted problem: given an abstract graph, decide whether it is realized by a map in which at most four regions meet at any point. The general recognition problem remains open.

Reference-contexts: The case analysis involved is very tedious (over a hundred cases must be examined); in Section 3 we include a top-level summary without detailed proofs; for a draft of the complete proof see <ref> [1] </ref>. The objects studied in the case analysis are partial maps, that is, sets of planar regions corresponding to the part of the graph being examined, with space left for embedding the rest. <p> For a draft of the full proof see <ref> [1] </ref>. 3.1 Preliminaries Let G be a graph. A map L is a finite set of planar regions that are disc homeomorphs with disjoint interiors. <p> We omit the details of each case. For a draft of the complete proof see <ref> [1] </ref> 4 Discussion and Open Problems The time bound O (n 3 ) follows from a very superficial and generous analysis of the running time. The cubic part comes from certain isolated cases, in which a less efficient kind of recursion occurs.

Reference-contexts: In fact, the following special case has been open since the 1960's <ref> [2] </ref>: We are given the status of all pairs of regions (we call this the fully conjunctive case) when two regions either overlap or are disjoint (that is, no two regions contain one another or touch on the outside).

Reference-contexts: This can probably be eliminated, bringing the time down to O (n 2 ). A further reduction to O (n log n) could be possible, by using ideas of dynamic connectivity in the face of edge deletions, see for example <ref> [6] </ref>. There is an interesting variant of the problem, in which we require that the union of the regions be a simply connected region, with no holes |that is to say, we do not allow "lakes" between the regions.

Reference-contexts: The naive algorithm is based on the following facts: (1) planar map graphs have O (n) maximal cliques, and (2) the maximal cliques of any graph can be output with polynomial delay between consecutive specimens output <ref> [7] </ref>. The reason why the naive algorithm fails is because a maximal clique in a planar map graph can be realized in ways other than the pizza, namely as a pizza with crust, a hamantaschen, and a rice ball, see Figure 2. <p> It can be probably reduce to O (n 2 ) by a more careful analysis, with some hope of bringing it down to O (n log n) (the best known running time for enumerating all maximal cliques, see <ref> [7] </ref>). 2 Planar Map Graphs 2.1 A Characterization Consider a collection R of n regions in the plane, each homeomorphic to a disc, so that no two regions overlap except possibly on their boundaries; these adjacencies define a planar map graph G.

Reference-contexts: In other words, we are seeking a recognition algorithm for the intersection graphs of planar curves. As we mentioned, it is open whether this problem is decidable; it is known that there are infinitely many forbidden subgraphs; that recognition is at least NP-hard <ref> [8] </ref>; and that there are string graphs that require exponentially many string intersections for their realization [9]. The difficulty of the string graph problem exposes the fact that the complexity of topological inference stems to a large extent from the messy "overlaps" relation.

But many practical applications are so structured that no two regions in them overlap (think of political maps, for example).
