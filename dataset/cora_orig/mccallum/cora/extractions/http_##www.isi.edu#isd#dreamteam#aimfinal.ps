Abstract: Robot soccer competition provides an excellent opportunity for integrated robotics research. In particular, robot players in a soccer game must recognize and track objects in real-time, navigate in a dynamic field, collaborate with teammates, and strike the ball in the correct direction. All these tasks demand robots that are autonomous (sensing, thinking, and acting as independent creatures), efficient (functioning under time and resource constraints), cooperative (collaborating with each other to accomplish tasks that are beyond individuals capabilities), and intelligent (reasoning and planing actions and perhaps learning from experience). Furthermore, all these capabilities must be integrated into a single and complete system, and this raises a set of challenges that are new to individual research disciplines. This paper describes our experience (problems and solutions) in these aspects. Our robots share the same general architecture and basic hardware, but they have integrated abilities to play different roles (goalkeeper, defender or forward) and utilize different strategies in their behavior. Our philosophy in building these robots is to use the least sophistication to make them as robust and integrated as possible. In RoboCup97, these integrated robots performed well and our Dreamteam won the world championship in the middlesized robot league.

Reference-contexts: Related Work The approach we used in RoboCup97 is descended from an earlier, integrated system called LIVE [10] for autonomous learning from the environment [9]. It also shares ideas with integrated cognitive architectures in [6], layered-controlled robots <ref> [3] </ref>, behavior-based robots [1,2], as well as recent progress in Agent research [4]. The unique feature of our robots, however, is the use of internal model and closed-loop control in action planning and execution.

Conclusions and Future Work In building integrated robots that are autonomous, efficient, collaborative, and intelligent, we have demonstrated a simple but effective approach.

Reference-contexts: This approach worked very well in the competition, and contributed a great deal to the success of our team. 5. The Decision Engine Based on the existing theories of autonomous agents (for example <ref> [9] </ref>), integrated robots are best to be model-driven. This principle has guided our design and implementation of the brain of our robots, namely the Decision Engine. <p> Related Work The approach we used in RoboCup97 is descended from an earlier, integrated system called LIVE [10] for autonomous learning from the environment <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In the long run, it would also be nice to have the robot learn from its own successes and mistakes (such as scoring at ones own goal). 7.
