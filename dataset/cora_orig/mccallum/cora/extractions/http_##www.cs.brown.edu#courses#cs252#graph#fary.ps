Title: A Linear-time Algorithm for Fary Embedding on a (2n 4) fi (n 2) Grid  
Author: Tutorial by: Hsueh-I Lu (hil) 
Date: August 31, 1991  
Abstract: This tutorial presents a linear-time algorithm which embeds a given n-node planar graph on a (2n 4) fi (n 2) grid such that the edges of this graph are straight-line segments.

Reference-contexts: Note that a maximal planar graph with n nodes has exactly 3n 6 edges, for all n 3. It follows from the result of Chazelle that triangulating a planar graph takes only O (n) time <ref> [Cha] </ref>. The rest of this section will discuss the canonical ordering of a maximal planar graph. Let us first show the way to decide a canonical ordering of 4 nodes of any maximal planar graph. STEP 1 Fix node 1 and node 2 in the exterior cycle.

Reference-contexts: This lower bound was later improved to n+O (n= log n) by Chrobak, Pach, and Pollack <ref> [CPP] </ref>. The objective of this tutorial is to show that: 1. A (2n 4) fi (n 2) grid is universal [FPP]. 2. The Fary embedding on the (2n 4) fi (n 2) grid can be done in linear time [ChP]. See Figure 2 for example.

Reference-contexts: I. Fary proved that every planar graph has such an embedding in 1948 <ref> [Far] </ref>. Let us use the complete graph with four nodes (K 4 ) as example. The picture in Figure 1-(a) is not a planar embedding of K 4 , since there is an edge intersection.
