Abstract: for some region of interest (say a 5 fi 5 window). Our first assumption is that, S(^u; ^v) = (u; v): In other words, we are assuming that the displacement vector (u; v) can be found by an image correlation principle. Note that this does not necesserily mean that g(x u; y v) = f (x; y) (though it will be very convenient if equality does hold in practice), but only that the minima of the SSD surface is at the correct displacement (u; v). The next step in the process is a linearization | a step typically done when one is faced with finding a numerical solution to a non-linear system. We take the first order Taylor series of g(x^u; y^v) around (x; y) and substitute the result in S(^u; ^v): 2 where I t = f(x; y) g(x; y). The term in brackets is the "constant brightness equation". The minimization of ^ S(^u; ^v) is simply a linear least-squares problem where the system of equations comprise of ^ug x + ^vg y + I t = 0 for all (x; y) 2 R. Therefore, when we search for a new constraint equation we need not carry the quadratic form, as we we later collect all the equations and obtain a linear least squares solution (which is equivalent of minimizing the quadratic form). As mentioned in the text, a linearization means that we should consider the linear solution as a single Newton iteration. For more details on incorporating the constant brightness equation in an iterative framework (within a coarse-to-fine data structure), see [3]. [17] A. Shashua and S. Avidan.
