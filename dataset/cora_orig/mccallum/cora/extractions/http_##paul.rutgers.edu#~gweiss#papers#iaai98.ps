Title: ANSWER: Network Monitoring Using Object-Oriented Rules  
Author: Gary M. Weiss Johannes P. Ros and Anoop Singhal

Abstract: This paper describes ANSWER, the expert system responsible for monitoring AT&Ts 4ESS switches. These switches are extremely important, since they handle virtually all of AT&Ts long distance traffic. ANSWER is implemented in R++, a rule-based extension to the C++ objectoriented programming language, and is innovative because it employs both rule-based and objectoriented programming paradigms. The use of object technology in ANSWER has provided a principled way of modeling the 4ESS and of reasoning about failures within the 4ESS. This has resulted in an expert system that is more clearly organized, easily understood and maintainable than its predecessor, which was implemented using the rule-based paradigm alone. ANSWER has been deployed for more than a year and handles all 140 of AT&Ts 4ESS switches and processes over 100,000 4ESS alarms per week.

Reference-contexts: In fact, there are many examples within the telecommunication industry of such systems. NYNEX uses the MAX expert system (Rabinowitz, Flamholz, Wolin & Euchner 1991) to locate problems in the local loop (the segment connecting each subscriber to the central office), Pacific Bell uses the trouble locator system <ref> (Chen, Hollidge, & Sharma 1996) </ref> to locate troubles in a local cable network and AT&T uses the Scout system (Sasisekharan, Seshadri, & Weiss 1996) to identify recurring transient network faults. A variety of AI techniques could be used by an expert system to perform network monitoring and alarm filtering.

Reference-contexts: A system to help monitor the 4ESS switch was first implemented in C. Due to software maintenance problems with this approach, in 1990 this system was redesigned and reimplemented using C5, a C version of the popular OPS5 rule-based programming language <ref> (Cooper & Wogrin 1988) </ref>. However, as additional rules were added to this new 4ESS-ES (4ESS expert system) in response to changes in the network, this system became less maintainable.

Reference-contexts: For object oriented technology to be useful in this context, there must be a way for ANSWER to model the 4ESS as a collection of objects. A simplified version of the object model is shown in Figure 2, using Rumbaughs Object Modeling Technique <ref> (Rumbaugh, Blaha, Premerlani & Eddy 1991) </ref>. Device Unit SNE PROC CNI Alert Sends State Has Alarm Receives Standby SubParts The 4ESS is readily viewed as a collection of devices and consequently device is the central object in the 4ESS object model.
