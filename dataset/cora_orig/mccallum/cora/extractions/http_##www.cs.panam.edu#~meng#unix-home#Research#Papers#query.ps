Abstract: In this paper we study the problem of searching the Web with machine learning techniques. We consider that Web documents can be represented by vectors of n boolean attributes. A search engine is viewed as a learner and a user is viewed as a teacher. We investigate the number of queries a search engine needs from the user to search for a collection of Web documents. We show that any collection of documents represented by a disjunction (or a conjunction) of k relevant attributes can be exactly identified by a search engine with at most k log 2 n membership queries, or with at most 1:885k log 2 equivalence queries. Considering the size of the Web [7], when k is small, say, k = 5, our results shows that in theory any collection of Web documents represented by disjunctions (or conjunctions) of 5 attributes can be exactly identified with no more than 25 membership queries, or with no more than 24 equivalence queries. n

Reference-contexts: The user are forced to manually sift through the long list to search for useful information. The interaction between a search engine and a user is much like the process of on-line learning with queries. In the on-line learning model <ref> [1, 8] </ref> with equivalence and membership queries, the goal of a learner for a concept class C over the domain Z is to learn any unknown target concept c t 2 C that has been fixed by a teacher.

Reference-contexts: One direction we are planning to study is how to accumulate attributes based on the category classification tree of Yahoo. In practice, a vocabulary of keywords is used as a set of attributes to build a vector space (for example, <ref> [2] </ref>). The size of a vocabulary could be very large, say, for example, 10,000 keywords.

Reference-contexts: This idea can be extended to a group of users such as a group of all computer science faculty members in a department. Using a user's personal profile on filtering information in web search has been studied by researchers (for examples, <ref> [5, 6] </ref>). In a recent paper [9], we built a personal profile using the word frequencies from the files that a user has on his computer. This profile is used to aid the filtering of search results returned by search engines.

In our case, the algorithm maintains non-negative real-valued weights w 1 ; : : : ; w n for variables x 1 ; : : : ; x n , respectively. <p> The first way is called an elimination. while the second is called a promotion. The following is derived from Littlestone's Algorithm Winnow <ref> [8] </ref>, but we give a more careful analysis and thus obtain a better bound on the number of equivalence queries. Theorem 5.1.

Reference-contexts: Of course the number of queries can be reduced if we relax the exact identification requirement to approximate identification. One method for the approximate identification is to combine our learning algorithms with the vector similarity ranking technique <ref> [10] </ref>. Even though the analysis above tells us that within the next 10 years, the vector space f0; 1g 39 is big enough for presenting indexable web documents over the Internet, yet it is not easy to find those 39 boolean attributes to build the vector space.
