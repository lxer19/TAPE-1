Reference-contexts: In this paper, we show how to compute P C in linear time if the ordered list of edges or vertices of C is given. Related work has been done on finding a minimal enclosing triangle, see e.g. [KL85, OAMB86], a minimal enclosing square [FS75], a minimal enclosing k-gon <ref> [CY84, ACY85] </ref>, and a minimal enclosing equiangular or regular k-gon [DA84]. The purpose of the latter paper was to identify a restricted class of k-gons that yielded algorithms that were faster than those for the general enclosing k-gon problem. In a regular polygon, all edges have equal length.

Reference-contexts: We give more details of the implementation and our experiments in Appendix A. As further work, we plan to include the linear-time algorithm in the digital signal processing system Ptolemy <ref> [BHLM94] </ref>. Finally, there are more related geometric problems that arise in design of digital processing methods as described in Section 4. First, elongated hexagons are another desirable shape to enclose filters that occupy a single region of the frequency domain.

Reference-contexts: The rational matrix can always be factored into a product L 1 M , where L and M are integer matrices, see <ref> [CV93, ETS94] </ref>. The overall compression ratio is the area of one period of the frequency domain (4 2 ) divided by the area of the parallelogram, which is equivalent to j det M j=j det Lj. <p> For convex polygon shapes, the only two candidates are parallelograms and elongated hexagons. In the case of the parallelogram, the procedure to compute the rational matrix mapping is already known <ref> [CV93] </ref>. (The vertices of the parallelogram, however, must be rational multiples of to compute the rational matrix.) Resampling elongated hexagons is an area of future work. 5 Conclusion In this paper, we considered the problem of computing a minimum area enclosing parallelogram for a given convex polygon.

Reference-contexts: Then a minimal enclosing parallelogram P C can be computed in time O (n). 4 Application The application that motivated this research is compressing two-dimensional signals based on their frequency content.

Reference-contexts: Let n denote the number of vertices in C. Then there are O (n) antipodal pairs, and they can be computed in O (n) time, using the "rotating calipers" algorithm, see <ref> [HT85] </ref>. Step 2, which checks all pairs in the list computed in step 1, consequently takes time O (n 2 ). We have Lemma 3 The simple algorithm given above computes P C in O (n 2 ) time.

Reference-contexts: While a fine resolution is desirable for appropriate modeling, the complexity of such a method increases sharply with the resolution of that grid. We implemented and animated both the simple quadratic and the linear time algorithm in C++, using the algorithms library LEDA <ref> [NM90] </ref>. As a result, we found that the implementation of the linear-time algorithm is not substantially more difficult than that of the simple quadratic algorithm. Consequently, the code sizes for both algorithms are almost equal, and the same holds for the constant factors in the running times.
