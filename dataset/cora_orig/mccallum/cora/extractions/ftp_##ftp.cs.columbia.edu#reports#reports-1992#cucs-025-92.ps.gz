Abstract: Technical Report No. CUCS-025-92 June 24, 1992 Abstract Empirical measurement is an important research tool in networked systems, providing concrete answers to questions including latency, bandwidth, utilization, and communications patterns. The presence of networks, however, complicates the task of measuring software systems. Networks introduce a host of often uncontrollable factors message latency, network reliability, etc. We examine issues in empirical measurement, particularly in the measurement of networked software systems. We then present a survey of representative measurement literature using a framework derived from these measurement issues. Finally we suggest the probable direction of future work in the field.

The study describes DECnet traffic characteristics in a live environment. Using this data they compare the performance of several DECnet protocol implementations.

Analysis O*ine Table 2: Chiu and Sudama A Case Study of DECnet Applications and Protocol Performance 3.1.2 Packet Trains in NSFnet "Traffic Characterization of the NSFNET National Backbone" by Heimlich <ref> [Hei90] </ref> is a traffic study in two uncontrolled Internet settings (a University LAN and a backbone WAN). The study starts with traditional traffic breakdowns. Using traffic breakdown statistics, Heimlich found the phenomenon of packet trains [JR86] in his traces. <p> The first is a detailed traffic classification, similar to work by Caceres et al [CDJM91] (section 3.1.5) but is restricted to internal LAN traffic.

Reference-contexts: The first way to violate packet conservation is to fail to reach equilibrium. Jacob-son shows that TCP is self clocking and stable once started but it is hard to start. To solve this he presents the slow-start algorithm <ref> [Jac88] </ref>. Slow-start avoids a sudden rush of packets when a transmission begins on a TCP connection. Without slow-start, throughput was only 35% of the available bandwidth (7Kbytes/second). Each packet was retransmitted at least once and packets 108 through 116 were sent five times.

Reference-contexts: They adopt options that expand the sliding window ("window scale") and handle potential sequence number wrap-around ("echo"). The second type comes from implementation improvements, many of which are also already published but not widely adopted. These include slow-start (see section 3.2.4), and header prediction <ref> [Jac90] </ref>. The third type of improvement came from tuning system parameters such as kernel buffer sizes and kernel to user space transfer sizes. The authors arranged these changes as a series of steps. After each step they measure the throughput.

Reference-contexts: The study starts with traditional traffic breakdowns. Using traffic breakdown statistics, Heimlich found the phenomenon of packet trains <ref> [JR86] </ref> in his traces. He modified the routing algorithms of NSFnet to improve their performance by taking advantage of packet trains. Packet trains are groups of packets between the same source and the same destination occurring in rapid succession. Each packet train is separated from successive trains by inter-train gaps.

Reference-contexts: This 14.7% corresponded to 95% of the available bandwidth on the external T-1 line that connected the LAN to the regional network. Previous studies by other authors (e.g. <ref> [SH80] </ref>) had much lower average and peak utilizations. Burstiness analysis shows that the traffic is bursty over a wide range of time scales.

Reference-contexts: It provides a lighter treatment of the measurements of RFC1128, placing those results in the context of the protocol development. Mills's work in validating the operational properties of NTP has begun to move it into the domain of support protocols. For example, Lixia Zhang's Virtual Clock Protocol, <ref> [Zha91] </ref>, is a transport protocol which has been proposed and simulated and 22 is now being implemented. It uses clocking to distribute resources. The better the synchronization of the clocks, the lower its overhead and better its performance. The measurements were acquired using systems running the Fuzzball operating system.
