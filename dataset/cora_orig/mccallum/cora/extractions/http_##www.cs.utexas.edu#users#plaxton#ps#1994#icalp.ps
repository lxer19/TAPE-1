Title: A Super-Logarithmic Lower Bound for Hypercubic Sorting Networks  
Author: C. Greg Plaxton Torsten Suel

Abstract: lg lg n) lg n have been discovered. These networks are the only known sorting networks of depth o(lg 2 n) that are not based on expanders, and their existence raises the question of whether a depth of O(lg n) can be achieved by any hypercubic sorting network. In this paper, we resolve this question by establishing an lg n lg lg n lower bound on the depth of any n-input hypercubic sorting network. Our lower bound can be extended to certain restricted classes of non-oblivious sorting algorithms on hypercubic machines.

While the AKS network is the only known sorting network with O (lg n) depth, it also suffers from two significant shortcomings. First, the multiplicative constant hidden by the O-notation is impractically large.

Reference-contexts: While the AKS network is the only known sorting network with O (lg n) depth, it also suffers from two significant shortcomings. First, the multiplicative constant hidden by the O-notation is impractically large. Through a series of improvements <ref> [3, 14] </ref>, this constant has been reduced to below 2000, but remains impractical. Second, the structure of the network is highly irregular, and does not seem to map efficiently to any of the common interconnection schemes.

Reference-contexts: Finally, our lower bound technique can also be applied to some restricted classes of sorting algorithms on multi-dimensional meshes. Examples of algorithms in these classes were recently given by Corbett and Scherson <ref> [4] </ref> and Wanka [20]. On the other hand, our lower bounds do not apply to "probabilistic" sorting networks that sort the vast majority of input permutations, or to "randomized" sorting networks that contain additional "randomizing" circuit elements.

Reference-contexts: This situation has motivated a number of attempts to construct O (lg n)-depth sorting networks with simpler, more regular topologies, and/or a considerably smaller constant. Three classes of networks that have received particular attention are Shellsort networks <ref> [5, 10, 16, 19] </ref>, periodic sorting networks [8, 9], and hypercubic sorting networks [13, 15]. In this paper, we focus on the class of hypercubic sorting networks, a notion that is formalized below.

Reference-contexts: Through a series of improvements [3, 14], this constant has been reduced to below 2000, but remains impractical. Second, the structure of the network is highly irregular, and does not seem to map efficiently to any of the common interconnection schemes. For example, Cypher <ref> [6] </ref> has shown that any emulation of the AKS network on the cube-connected cycles requires (lg 2 n) time. (A sorting algorithm emulates the AKS network if it performs the same sequence of comparisons on any input.) In contrast, the networks proposed by Batcher have a relatively simple structure and a

Reference-contexts: Our lower bound also extends to certain restricted classes of non-oblivious sorting algorithms on hypercubic machines and multi-dimensional meshes. However, our lower bound argument does not allow the copying of elements by the algorithm. Thus, the Sharesort sorting algorithm of Cypher and Plaxton <ref> [7] </ref>, which achieves a running time of O (lg n lg lg n) (with preprocessing) on any of the hypercubic machines, is not subject to our lower bound. <p> Of particular 11 interest in this respect would be the class of normal comparison-based sorting algo-rithms, or any other natural class of algorithms including the Sharesort algorithm of Cypher and Plaxton <ref> [7] </ref>. Another possible direction for future research would be to consider other restricted classes of sorting networks. Finally, it is an open problem whether our lower bound technique can be applied to selection networks.

Reference-contexts: More precisely, the structure of the hypercubic sorting networks corresponds exactly to the class of normal algorithms on the hypercube, while the structures of the shu*e-based and unshu*e-based networks correspond to the classes of descend and ascend algorithms, respectively (see <ref> [11] </ref> for a definition of these classes). Most of the important algorithms that have been proposed for the hypercube are normal (e.g., Fast Fourier Transform, parallel prefix, bitonic merging and sorting).

Reference-contexts: The best upper bound for this class is given by Batcher's bitonic sort [2], with a depth of O (lg 2 n). A lower bound of (lg 2 n= lg lg n) was recently established by Plaxton and Suel <ref> [17] </ref>. However, this lower bound does not extend to arbitrary hypercubic networks. The class of hypercubic sorting networks was defined by Leighton and Plaxton [13, 15], who show the existence of a family of hypercubic sorting networks with depth 2 O ( lg lg n) lg n. <p> To do so, we will first review the lower bound argument for shu*e-based networks given in <ref> [17] </ref>, and explain why this relatively simple argument does not extend to the more general class of hypercubic sorting networks. <p> To explain this idea, we first consider the proof of the lower bound for shu*e-based sorting networks in <ref> [17] </ref>; the case of the unshu*e-based networks is symmetric. Note that a shu*e-based network can be seen as a concatenation of a number of butterfly networks of depth lg n each. <p> at most a polylogarithmic factor in each butterfly, then at least (lg n= lg lg n) consecutive butterflies are needed in order to bring the size of the incomparable set down to 1; this directly implies the (lg 2 n= lg lg n) lower bound for shu*e-based sorting networks of <ref> [17] </ref>. The following recursive definition of a butterfly is crucial for understanding our proof technique: A butterfly with 2 d inputs and depth d consists of two parallel 2 d1 - input butterflies of depth d 1, followed by a final level of up to 2 d1 comparators. <p> In other words, the observer will not be able to say anything about the relative strength of the two "subtournaments" before the final stage. This "disjointness property" of the subnetworks plays a crucial role in the lower bound argument of <ref> [17] </ref>. Instead of maintaining only a single incomparable set, we now maintain a collection of incomparable sets in each recursive subnetwork. <p> In <ref> [17] </ref>, it is shown that there exists a partial matching between these two collections of sets such that, if we combine the sets according to the matching and remove one element from every pair of elements from the same set that gets compared, we obtain a new collection of incomparable sets <p> To formalize this proof idea, the notion of an input pattern representing a class 4 of similar inputs was introduced in <ref> [17] </ref>. <p> First, we show in Section 3 how the lower bound argument for shu*e-based networks can be modified to handle hypercubic networks with small overlap. The overall structure of this proof is very similar to that in <ref> [17] </ref>. However, a number of subtle changes are required in order to extend the argument to networks with non-zero overlap. The modified proof is based on the observation that, informally speaking, a shu*e-based network with small overlap still satisfies some relaxed version of the "disjointness property". <p> The proof of Lemma 3.3 has a very similar structure to that of Lemma 4.1 in <ref> [17] </ref>, and we only describe the necessary modifications. Most of the notations used in this section are taken from [17]. For the sake of completeness, we define these notations again in the following subsections.
