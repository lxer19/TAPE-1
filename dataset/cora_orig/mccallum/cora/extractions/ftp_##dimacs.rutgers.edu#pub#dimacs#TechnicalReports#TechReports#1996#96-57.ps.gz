Reference-contexts: We do not optimize the constants used in our statements. The existence of weak -systems in set systems has been studied since long time ago, cf. [ER 60], [ER 69], [ES 78], [FR 87], <ref> [AFK 95] </ref>. The best lower bound was proved by P. Erd-os and E. Szemeredi in [ES 78].

Reference-contexts: They showed: Theorem 1.2 There exists a family F of subsets of a given set S so that F does not contain a weak -system, where jSj = n and jF j n log n=4 log log n : This lower bound is also mentioned in <ref> [E 90] </ref>. The best known upper bound was proved in the following stronger form by P. Frankl and V. Rodl [FR 87].
