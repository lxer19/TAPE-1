Reference-contexts: This enlarged, redundant family of vectors we call a dictionary. The advantage of redundancy in obtaining compact representations can be seen by considering the problem of representing a two-dimensional surface given by f (x; y) on a subset of the plane, I fi I, where I is the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. An adaptive square mesh representation of f in the Besov space B ff q (L q (I)), where 1 q = ff+1 2 , can be obtained using a wavelet basis. <p> We construct a function which has energy spread all across the orthonormal basis. The ill-conditioned elements are selected because they are much better suided to expanding the function in question than the vectors of the orthonormal basis. Theorem 4.2 There exists a function f 2 L 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and a dictionary for L 2 [0; 1] that contains an orthonormal basis such that the dictionary elements in the orthogonal matching pursuit expansion of f do not form a Riesz basis. Proof: We first define a set of functions on L 2 [0; 1] which we will use <p> The ill-conditioned elements are selected because they are much better suided to expanding the function in question than the vectors of the orthonormal basis. Theorem 4.2 There exists a function f 2 L 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and a dictionary for L 2 [0; 1] that contains an orthonormal basis such that the dictionary elements in the orthogonal matching pursuit expansion of f do not form a Riesz basis. Proof: We first define a set of functions on L 2 [0; 1] which we will use to construct our dictionary and our function. <p> function f 2 L 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and a dictionary for L 2 [0; 1] that contains an orthonormal basis such that the dictionary elements in the orthogonal matching pursuit expansion of f do not form a Riesz basis. Proof: We first define a set of functions on L 2 [0; 1] which we will use to construct our dictionary and our function. Let w k (t) = 2 2k [12 k ;12 k +2 4k ] (t); (4:16) for k 1. <p> The w k 's are a set of step functions which tend towards a delta function at t = 1 as k goes to infinity. Our dictionary consists of the Fourier basis for L 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> together with the set (x k ) k1 defined by, x 1 (t) = w 1 (t) (4.17) 1 2 w k (t): (4.18) We have D = (x k ) k1 [ (e 2ikt ) k2Z : (4:19) We take as our function to decompose, f = k=1 <p> Because non-orthogonal pursuits yield expansions in terms of dictionary elements, rather than in terms of the orthogonalized dictionary elements, the selection of a degenerate collection does not pose difficulties. Theorem 4.3 There exists a function f 2 L 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and a dictionary for L 2 [0; 1] that contains an orthonormal basis such that the dictionary elements in the non-orthogonal matching pursuit expansion of f do not form a Riesz basis. <p> Because non-orthogonal pursuits yield expansions in terms of dictionary elements, rather than in terms of the orthogonalized dictionary elements, the selection of a degenerate collection does not pose difficulties. Theorem 4.3 There exists a function f 2 L 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and a dictionary for L 2 [0; 1] that contains an orthonormal basis such that the dictionary elements in the non-orthogonal matching pursuit expansion of f do not form a Riesz basis. We show that functions and dictionaries exist for which the selected dictionary elements fail to satisfy the upper or lower frame bounds. <p> We first construct from the functions w k above dictionary a function for which the selected elements do not satisfy the upper frame bound. Our dictionary consists of the Fourier basis for L 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> together with the degenerate sets (x k ) k1 and (y k ) k1 defined by, x 1 = y 1 = w 1 (4.35) 1 2 1 2 y k = p w 1 p w k (4.37) We have D = (x k ) k1 [ (y <p> CHAOS IN MATCHING PURSUITS 40 of a binary shift operator acting on a binary decimal: the shift operator removes the most significant digit of the expansion and then multiplies the decimal by 2, which is analogous to a renormalization.

[0; 1] is defined by L (0:s 1 s 2 s 3 . . .) = 0:s 2 s 3 <p> Definition 6.1 Let s 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> be expanded in binary form 0:s 1 s 2 s 3 . . ., where s i 2 f0; 1g. The binary left-shift map L : [0; 1] ! [0; 1] is defined by L (0:s 1 s 2 s 3 . . .) = 0:s 2 s 3 s 4 . . . : (6:4) The binary shift map is well-known to be chaotic with respect to the Lebesgue measure on [0; 1]. <p> Definition 6.1 Let s 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> be expanded in binary form 0:s 1 s 2 s 3 . . ., where s i 2 f0; 1g. The binary left-shift map L : [0; 1] ! [0; 1] is defined by L (0:s 1 s 2 s 3 . . .) = 0:s 2 s 3 s 4 . . . : (6:4) The binary shift map is well-known to be chaotic with respect to the Lebesgue measure on [0; 1]. <p> left-shift map L : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! [0; 1] is defined by L (0:s 1 s 2 s 3 . . .) = 0:s 2 s 3 s 4 . . . : (6:4) The binary shift map is well-known to be chaotic with respect to the Lebesgue measure on [0; 1]. We recall the three conditions that characterize a chaotic map T : ! [14] [10]. 1. T must have a sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Let T (k) = T ffi T ffi . . . ffi T , k times. <p> Following a standard technique [14], the homeomorphism h is constructed by assigning to each point x 2 I a binary decimal in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> with digits corresponding to the itinerary of x h (x) = 0 : i (x) i (F (2) (x)) i (F (4) (x)) i (F (6) (x)) . . . (6:13) The itinerary of F (2) (x) is just the itinerary of x shifted left, so we have h <p> We first show that F (2) is measure-preserving. Let h be the homeomorphism satisfying h ffi F (2) = L ffi h (7:2) on , and let be the Lebesgue measure. The shift map L preserves the Lebesgue measure, so we have for any set S 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> that -(S) = -(L 1 S): (7:3) We define (S) = -(h (S)), where h (S) = fh (x) : x 2 Sg. This is a measure because h is a measurable function. <p> For our numerical experiments, we will optimize a subset of the Gabor dictionary which is parametrized by a single scale. This type of optimization is particularly important when we work with dictionaries which are characterized by a large number of parameters. For example, [48] <ref> [1] </ref> expands speech signals into sums of formant-wave functions, a set of waveforms which model the partial response of the vocal tract to a single excitation produced by the vocal cords.

H defined by T f = fl2 is invertible. <p> The dictionary of time-frequency atoms D = (g fl (t)) fl2 is a very redundant set of functions that includes both window Fourier frames and wavelet frames <ref> [13] </ref>. When the window function g is the Gaussian g (t) = 2 1=4 e t 2 , the resulting time-frequency atoms are Gabor functions, and have optimal localization in time and in frequency. A matching pursuit decomposes any f 2 L 2 (R) into f = n=0 CHAPTER 3. <p> Property (5.6) is satisfied for the Gabor dictionary and the group G composed of dilations, translations and modulations for H = L 2 (R). This comes from our ability to construct frames of L 2 (R) through translations and dilations or frequency modulations of Gaussian functions <ref> [13] </ref>. This result implies that there exists a choice function such that the matching pursuit in a Gabor dictionary commutes with dilations translations and frequency modulations.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the coherent reconstruction is audibly less noisy than the original signal. [58] proposes a denoising procedure based upon the fact that white noise is poorly represented in the Gabor dictionary, which was inspired by numerical experiments with the decay of the residues. Similar ideas exist in [51] <ref> [18] </ref>, namely, to separate "noise" from a signal, we approximate a signal using a scheme which efficiently approximates the portion of interest but inefficiently approximates the noise.

Reference-contexts: Hence, for almost all x 2 , T n x neither goes to a fixed point or a limit cycle, so for most of the asymptotic behavior of T n x is complicated. The binary left shift map on [0,1] is ergodic with respect the Lebesgue measure <ref> [38] </ref>. We can use the topological conjugacy relation (6.11) we derived in chapter 6 to prove that the renormalized matching pursuit map F is also ergodic when restricted to one of two invariant sets. We first prove that the map F (2) of the previous chapter is ergodic.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION 7 leads to intrinsically unstable expansions which accounts for some of the difficulty in finding these expansions. As a result of these complexity results, we turn to sub-optimal methods for finding expansions. In chapter 3 we review the matching pursuit algorithm of <ref> [39] </ref>, and in chapter 4.1 we introduce an orthogonalized version of the algorithm which has improved convergence properties. We compare the complexity and performance of these two algorithms for a set of speech data with a dictionary of time-frequency atoms.

Reference-contexts: For this application we use as a dictionary a family of vectors which are optimally localized in the time-frequency plane, a collection of translated, modulated, and scaled Gaussians. Wavelet packets have poor frequency localization <ref> [42] </ref> and are thus much less efficient for performing this task. The constraint that the best-basis decomposition be an orthogonal basis is an additional hindrance to performance when signals are non-stationary.
