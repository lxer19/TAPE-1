Abstract: The theory of wavelets is a developing branch of mathematics with a wide range of potential applications. Compactly supported wavelets are particularly interesting because of their natural ability to represent data with intrinsically local properties. They are useful for the detection of edges and singularities in image and sound analysis, and for data compression. However, most of the wavelet based procedures currently available do not explicitly account for the presence of noise in the data. A discussion of how this can be done in the setting of some simple nonparametric curve estimation problems is given. Wavelet analogues of some familiar kernel and orthogonal series estimators are introduced and their finite sample and asymptotic properties are studied. We discover that there is a fundamental instability in the asymptotic variance of wavelet estimators caused by the lack of translation invariance of the wavelet transform. This is related to the properties of certain lacunary sequences. The practical consequences of this instability are assessed.

Reference-contexts: Hazard rate estimation In this section we study a wavelet version of Ramlau-Hansens [RH83] estimator of a hazard rate function. It turns out that most of the wavelet techniques we have used for nonparametric regression carry over to this setting. Since the work of Aalen <ref> [Aa78] </ref>, it is well known that hazard rate estimation can be viewed in the context of inference for a counting process multiplicative intensity model given by .t / D ff.t /Y .t /, where Y .t / is a nonnegative observed process.

Another example is presented in Figure 5.2.

In this example the assumptions of the fixed design model are much more reasonable. We find that there is an undesirable boundary effect in Or at time 0.

Reference-contexts: For the fixed design model we propose the estimator: Or.t / D iD1 Z E m .t; s/ ds; where the A i are intervals that partition [0; 1] with t i 2 A i . This is a wavelet version of Gasser and Mullers <ref> [GM79] </ref> (convolution) kernel estimator or of Hardles ([Ha90], p. 51) orthogonal series estimator. <p> We are also able to establish rate of convergence results for Or and asymptotic normality results for suitably modified versions of Or and Qr. For Or we do this by adapting some techniques that were originally developed for kernel estimators by Gasser and Muller <ref> [GM79] </ref>. Eubank and Speckman [ES91] have studied rates of convergence for a least squares orthogonal series estimator for r. They used trigonometric series and their method of proof is heavily dependent on the special properties of these systems. <p> A similar change can be made to Qr. Note that Or and Or c agree at dyadic rationals of the form k=2 m . Asymptotic results for this estimator are special cases of those given in Gasser and Muller <ref> [GM79] </ref>, although by using this special kernel K we can relax the smoothness conditions on r . However, a finite sample comparison between Or and Or c that examines their integrated mean squared errors for various values of m shows that Or is superior, see subsection 5.1. <p> A disadvantage of more regular wavelets is that their support is larger and therefore boundary effects more pronounced. However, wavelet estimators based on more regular compactly supported wavelets are unbiased away from the boundary for higher order polynomials, see (2.3). As in Gasser and Muller <ref> [GM79] </ref> for the fixed design case, to study the mean square error of Or we assume that max jt i t i1 j D O.n 1 /: .3:1/ We shall also assume that for some Lipschitz function ./, ae.n/ j max fi fi s i s i1 n fi 10 Wavelet <p> This is a standard assumption for the fixed design model, but somewhat weaker than the asymptotic equidistance assumption of Gasser and Muller <ref> [GM79] </ref> in which .t / j 1 and ae.n/ D O.n ffi / for some ffi &gt; 1.

In order to give a rate of convergence for the mean squared error of their estimates, Gasser and Muller <ref> [GM79] </ref> assume that r is k-times continuously differentiable and use a kernel of order k 2. They find that the best rate of convergence for the mean squared error is 12 Wavelet methods for curve estimation n 2k=.2kC1/ . An analogous result holds in our case.

Reference-contexts: Any nonparametric regression method is highly dependent on the tuning parameter, so it is desirable to select such parameters automatically. The problem of selecting m is rather easier than the bandwidth selection problem for kernel estimators (see, e.g. Hardle and Marron [HM85] in the regression case and Gregoire <ref> [Gr91] </ref> in the survival analysis case), since the bandwidth is essentially reduced to being of the form 2 m where m &lt; 1 2 log 2 n. A commonly-used selection rule adapted to our setting is to choose m as the minimizer of the 17 A. Antoniadis, G.

Reference-contexts: To illustrate the techniques given so far, and to add to the earlier discussion, we now consider two real examples. The first example concerns the motor-cycle impact data given in Hardle <ref> [Ha90] </ref> and presented in Figure 5.1. The observations consist of accelerometer readings taken through time in an experiment on the efficacy of crash helmets. This particular data set was also analyzed by Silverman [Sil85] by spline smoothing techniques. For several reasons the time points are not regularly spaced.

We shall obtain consistency of Or and Qr, for Or by applying a result of Isogai. <p> Under certain conditions (see Daubechies [Dau90], p. 951), the sequence of functions ' j converges pointwise to a limit function ' that satisfies the two-scale difference equation (2.1). 3. Nonparametric regression In this section we establish consistency of Or using a theorem of Isogai <ref> [Iso90] </ref>. Also, under conditions on the regression function r that are weaker than the usual smoothness assumptions, we give asymptotic bounds for the bias and variance of Or and establish asymptotic normality for a modified version of Or. <p> In fact, considering that Or sym uses a tuning parameter setting chosen from among only three different values (m D 3; 4 and 5), it gives an outstanding result compared with other nonparametric regression estimates. 6. Proofs Proof of Theorem 3.1. We apply Theorem 3.1 of Isogai <ref> [Iso90] </ref> with 2 m in the role of m and E m in place of ffi m .

Moreover if is regular enough, the resulting wavelet orthonormal basis provides unconditional bases for most of the usual function spaces, see Meyer <ref> [Mey90] </ref>. In order to obtain such a result, Mallat [Mal89] introduced the notion of a multiresolution analysis, the definition of which we recall here: Definition 2.2.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Wavelet theory has the potential to provide statisticians with powerful new techniques for nonparametric inference. It combines recent advances in approximation theory with insights gained from applied signal analysis; for a recent survey on the use of wavelets in signal processing, see Rioul and Vetterli <ref> [RV91] </ref>, and for a recent discussion connecting wavelets with problems in nonparametric statistical inference, see Wegman [Weg91].

Reference-contexts: The first example concerns the motor-cycle impact data given in Hardle [Ha90] and presented in Figure 5.1. The observations consist of accelerometer readings taken through time in an experiment on the efficacy of crash helmets. This particular data set was also analyzed by Silverman <ref> [Sil85] </ref> by spline smoothing techniques. For several reasons the time points are not regularly spaced. It is of interest both to discern the general shape of the underlying acceleration curve and to draw inferences about its minimum and maximum values.

Reference-contexts: However the projections used by orthogonal series estimators are finite dimensional, whereas the projections used by the wavelet estimators are infinite dimensional. Wavelet estimators cannot be seen as location-adaptive kernel estimators either, cf. [BMP77]. In fact wavelet estimators are properly regarded as delta sequence estimators, see Walter and Blum <ref> [WB79] </ref>: Or is a special type of the delta sequence estimator studied recently by Isogai [Iso90]; Qr is a special case of the estimator considered by Collomb [Co81] and studied recently by Doukhan [Do90]. We shall obtain consistency of Or and Qr, for Or by applying a result of Isogai.
