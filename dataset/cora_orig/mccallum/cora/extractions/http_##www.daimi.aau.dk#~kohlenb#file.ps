Reference-contexts: Can you improve the bound we obtained from the latter (see Hacks [22])? 2) Let (a n ) n2IN be a sequence of rational numbers in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> with 8n 2 IN (a n+1 a n ). Since rational numbers can be coded by natural numbers one can consider (a n ) as a number theoretic function. The order relation and the usual arithmetical operations between rational numbers are primitive recursive in their codes. <p> Troelstra can be found in [18]), [65] (chapter 3, section 5; this is a very concise and compact treatment of functional interpretation), [52] (covers in detail C. Spector's extension of functional interpretation to analysis by means of bar recursion), <ref> [1] </ref> (a very readable and comprehensive treatment of the whole subject). [5] contains an interesting discussion about the functional interpretation of `!' from a constructive point of view. Applications of functional interpretation to systems of bounded arithmetic are given in [9].

Reference-contexts: Remark 3.12 One can show by much more complicated methods that E-HA ! + AC is conservative over HA. For a `neutral' version of E-HA ! without extensionality this is due to [19],[20],[21] (see also [54],[57]). The extension to E-HA ! is due to <ref> [2] </ref>. In contrast to corollaries 3.11 and 3.14 (below), this result does not relativize to subsystems with restricted induction (see [39]). Theorem 3.13 (soundness for mrt) Let H ! := E-HA ! + AC + ef and A be an arbitrary formula in L (E-HA ! ).

Reference-contexts: Proof: The proof theorem 6.6 easily relativizes to d WE-PA ! One can show that the function (al)s of types 2 definable by closed terms in d WE-HA j n are just the usual primitive recursive ones in the sense of Kleene (see <ref> [11] </ref>). From the proof of this fact combined with the previous proposition plus elimination of extensionality one gets Proposition 6.17 Let R (x; y) be a primitive recursive relation (in the sense of PRA).

Reference-contexts: The proofs for these results go beyond the scope of our lectures. One problem to be dealt with is that the functional interpretation of the negative translation of WKL is not even solvable in E-PA ! . 58 Chapter 7 The Friedman A-translation In <ref> [13] </ref> H. Friedman introduced a strikingly simple device to establish closure under the Markov rule in the form T i ` ::9xP (a; x) ) T i ` 9xP (a; x) (P is a prime formula) 1 which works for many intuitionistic theories T i . <p> Remark 7.1 The A-translation was independently also discovered by A.

Reference-contexts: All these translations A 7! A 0 have in common that A 0 is (or is intuitionistically equivalent to) a negative formula. The first such translation is due to Godel [16] (although G. Gentzen independently discovered a similar translation). There is some preceding work by Kolmogorov [41] and Glivenko <ref> [15] </ref>. Two further variants of Godel's translation are due to Kuroda [50] and it his one of these which we will adopt here: Definition 6.1 Let A be a formula in a theory based on L (IL ! ).

Reference-contexts: In the next lecture we will introduce a translation of the classical variant WE-PA ! of WE-HA ! (i.e. WE-HA ! plus the tertium-non-datur schema A _ :A) into WE-HA ! , the so-called negative translation A 7! A 0 due to <ref> [16] </ref>. <p> All these translations A 7! A 0 have in common that A 0 is (or is intuitionistically equivalent to) a negative formula. The first such translation is due to Godel <ref> [16] </ref> (although G.

Reference-contexts: The particular axiomatization we choose is due to <ref> [17] </ref> and particular suited to carry out proof interpretations inductively over the proof tree.

The free variables of A D are that of A. The types and length of x; y depend only on the logical structure of A. <p> For all three of them already (A ! A) i fails to have a computable solution for suitable A. Compute these interpretations (A ! B) i and give a counterexample to the computable solvability of (A ! A) i for at least one of them.

Reference-contexts: Use this proof to obtain an upper bound g (j) for the next prime p j+1 as in the 3. proof of this statement above. Can you improve the bound we obtained from the latter (see Hacks <ref> [22] </ref>)? 2) Let (a n ) n2IN be a sequence of rational numbers in [0; 1] with 8n 2 IN (a n+1 a n ). Since rational numbers can be coded by natural numbers one can consider (a n ) as a number theoretic function.

Reference-contexts: this bound one easily gets the lower bound log x 2 log 2 (for x 1) for the Euler -function (x) := j fp : p prime ^ p xg j whereas the bound from Euclid's proof only yields log log x (for x 2) as a lower bound, see <ref> [23] </ref> for details).

Reference-contexts: Intuitionistic Arithmetic Remark 2.2 There are various ways to formalize the idea behind the BHK-interpreta-tion which give rise to various forms of so-called realizability interpretations. The first version of realizability, the so-called recursive realiz-ability, was introduced by Kleene in <ref> [26] </ref>. In these lectures we will focus on a typed variant of Kleene's type-free interpretation which is called `modified realizability' and is due to Kreisel [44],[45].

Reference-contexts: In particular if we have a schema of purely universal axioms then in the statement of Herbrand's theorem this schema is always understood with respect to the original language (without the index functions). Otherwise the reverse direction in Herbrand's theorem in general would fail (see <ref> [29] </ref> for a discussion of this and related matters thereby pointing out errors in the literature). In general Herbrand's theorem in the form stated above does not hold for theories which are not open, e.g. it fails for PA.

Reference-contexts: This observation -which has been stressed in the context of first-order arithmetic by G. Kreisel- can be extended also to more general classes of formulas (see e.g. <ref> [30] </ref>). Finally, proof interpretations can easily be combined with each other: e.g in chapter 6 we used a combination of three different interpretations: elimination of extensionality, negative translation and functional interpretation. 63

Reference-contexts: The first such translation is due to Godel [16] (although G. Gentzen independently discovered a similar translation). There is some preceding work by Kolmogorov [41] and Glivenko [15]. Two further variants of Godel's translation are due to Kuroda <ref> [50] </ref> and it his one of these which we will adopt here: Definition 6.1 Let A be a formula in a theory based on L (IL ! ).

Reference-contexts: we omit the extensionality rule QF-ER. 3) The combination of negative translation, A-translation and modified realizability is not known to be faithful for subsystems PA n of PA with restricted induction (respectively for corresponding finite type extensions of PA n ) whereas negative translation combined with functional interpretation is (see <ref> [56] </ref> for the latter). Remark 7.1 The A-translation was independently also discovered by A. Dra-galin in [10]. In this lecture we will establish the A-translation only for HA since this suffices to illustrate the general pattern.

Reference-contexts: Unwinding Proofs The terms t i;j can be extracted constructively from a given PL-proof of A and conversely one can construct a PL-proof for A out of a given tautology A H;D . The theorem holds for PL = if `tautology' is replaced by `quasi-tautology'. Proof: See e.g. <ref> [60] </ref>. 2 The most difficult part of the proof of Herbrand's theorem is the construction of the Herbrand terms t i;j .
