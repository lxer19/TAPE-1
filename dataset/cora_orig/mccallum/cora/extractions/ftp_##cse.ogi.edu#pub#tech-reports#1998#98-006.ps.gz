Title: Location Independent Names for Nomadic Computers

Abstract: Recent advances in the Domain Name System (DNS) and the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) have enabled a new approach to supporting mobile users: location independent naming. In this approach, machines use the same hostname from any internet location, but use an IP address that corresponds to their current location. We describe a protocol that implements location independent naming for nomadic computers, i.e., machines that do not need transparent mobility. Our protocol allows hosts to move across security domains, uses existing protocols, and preserves existing trust relationships. Therefore, it preserves the performance and security of normal IP for nomadic computers at the expense of not providing the transparent mobility of Mobile IP. We contend that this is a reasonable tradeoff for nomadic computing.

Reference-contexts: The use of temporary RRs is practical independent of LIN, for example it would ease the task of revoking a 10 mapping of a host when it is moved by avoiding the complications induced by zone transfers <ref> [1] </ref>. Both additions require the DNS server be able to identify LIN requests. We propose two mechanisms that can achieve this effect. The first, and the one we advocate, is to add a flag to the DNS message header that marks the record as temporary.

Reference-contexts: Second, the DNS specification contains a minimum TTL in the start of zone authority (SOA) RR that is used to provide a minimum TTL on all responses [16]. Fortunately for LIN, most sites do not implement this feature <ref> [2] </ref>. For sites that do enforce a minimum, the administrator could have a separate DNS server for travelling hosts with a minimum of zero.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, most large-area wireless networks (such as Metrocoms Ricochet network [25] or CMUs wavelan network <ref> [3] </ref>) are represented as a single network, which means hosts maintain the same IP address as they move within the coverage area. 1 Users of cellular modems use the telephone network to dial into an ISP, and hence can maintain the same IP address and network location regardless of their physical

Reference-contexts: DNS dynamic update requestor [10], must inform DHCP of its fully qualified name, and must be able to renew its lease and the TTL on its ARR and PtrRR periodically. 4.8 What changes to DNS are needed for LIN? LIN requires two additions to DNS (as of BIND version 8.1 <ref> [4] </ref>): the addition of a maximum TTL for travelling hosts, and the addition of temporary ARRs and PtrRRs. The former is needed to prevent a malicious travelling host from using a TTL that is longer than the DHCPs lease time, and thus maintaining a bogus mapping for its address.

Reference-contexts: This encapsulation has several drawbacks. First, many network administrators consider this form of encapsulation to be a security breach, as it bypasses standard firewall mechanisms. Hence many security conscious administrators are configuring their firewalls to detect and abort IP tunnels <ref> [5] </ref>. Second, the extra header may make a packet larger than the maximum transmission size, forcing the packet to be fragmented.

Reference-contexts: In either case the DHCP server must add the appropriate PtrRR. This approach will provide the benefits of mobility within a security domain. For example, Brian Dols and Lans Carstensen at Rose-Hullman Institute of Technology <ref> [6] </ref> have implemented these protocols, allowing student to connect their laptops to any subnetworks on their campus without recon-figuring. These laptops maintain the same name as they move on campus, but get addresses corresponding to the network to which they are currently connected.

Reference-contexts: In addition, our home network is protected by a firewall that prevents us from using IP encapsulation (tunneling), and none of the hosts with which we want to communicate have the support for mobility built into their IP layer as proposed by Chesire and Baker <ref> [7] </ref> or Myles et al. [17]. As a result, we were forced to look for another alternative. In attempting to address our need, we realized that nomadic computing is a common form of mobile computing.

Reference-contexts: For reasons of security, a travelling host is allowed to rebind only its name and must authenticate with the home DNS in order to do so <ref> [9] </ref>.

TSIG is currently being developed for inclusion in DNS. TSIG uses a shared secret between a host and its DNS server for authentication, which means that a travelling host can securely update its name-to-address binding regardless of its location.

The weakest point in the security chain, the travelling host, is only granted limited trust. The home DNS server trusts the travelling host to provide a correct IP addresses for itself.
