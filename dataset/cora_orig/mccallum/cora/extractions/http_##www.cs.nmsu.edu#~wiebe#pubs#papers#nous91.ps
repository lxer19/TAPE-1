Title: References in Narrative Text

Abstract: The propositional content of a reference is the proposition attributing to the referent the properties that correspond to the nouns and modifiers in the reference (for example, the propositional content of `Mary' is that the referent is named `Mary'). During language comprehension, the hearer or reader must determine the set of beliefs with respect to which the propositional content of a reference is to be understood. In the prototypical case, this set consists of the propositions that she believes that the speaker or writer believes that she and the speaker or writer mutually believe. This paper identifies two contexts in which the propositional content of a specific reference is not understood with respect to this set| subjective and objective sentences in third-person fictional narrative text|and identifies some implications of this for understanding specific references in these contexts.

Reference-contexts: that within a discourse segment, anaphoric references can be resolved to concepts evoked in that segment, but once a segment has ended, those concepts are no longer available for anaphoric reference (but note that there can be discourse returns to segments, and semantic returns to concepts evoked in previous segments <ref> (Allen 1987) </ref>). As a consequence, each segment should have its own local history list. Some phenomena I have observed in narrative suggest that each subjective and objective context is a discourse segment composed of sub-segments.

Reference-contexts: If a more nested environment than H believes (MB) is required, then the hearer understands the reference in spite of some private belief that she holds or some private belief that she believes that the speaker holds. <ref> (Note that Cohen 1978 specifies a finite representation of mutual belief.) </ref> The importance of this discussion for our purposes is that the hearer cannot consider only what she believes or only what the speaker believes in order to understand references in conversation. <p> This may occur when the head noun is a superordinate term, such as `plant' or `vehicle', 20 rather than either a basic-level term, such as `flower' or `car', or a subordinate term, such as `violet' or `station wagon' <ref> (Rosch and Lloyd 1978) </ref>. Often, it should be understood from the use of the superordinate term that the subjective character cannot classify the referent at the basic level.

Reference-contexts: Rather, it creates by fiat a fictional reality which can only be taken as fictionally true.
