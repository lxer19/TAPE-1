Abstract: Matrices representing dissimilarities within a set of objects are familiar in mathematics, statistics and psychology. In this paper we describe XGvis, a software system which accepts diverse input data, such as graphs and multivariate data, develops a dissimilarity matrix from the data, and then iteratively and interactively embeds objects in a Euclidean space of arbitrary dimension. Using a technique called multidimensional scaling, objects are positioned so that their pairwise distances match the target dissimilarities as well as possible. Users can interact with XGobi, a software system for visualizing high-dimensional data, to browse the resulting embeddings. Mathematicians and statisticians have found XGvis to be useful for discovering and exploring structure.

Reference-contexts: Interactive MDS optimization was implemented by one of us on a workstation in 1982, but it was never documented other than in a film <ref> (Buja, 1982) </ref>. 3. Control and Visualization Embeddings in XGvis proceed as follows: a user begins an XGvis session by invoking the program with some initial data. Using default routines, XGvis creates a dissimilarity matrix from the data. <p> Some useful ways of selecting subsets by brushing and rerunning MDS on the brushed subsets were provided in an earlier implementation <ref> (Buja, 1982) </ref>. These have not been included in the current XGvis system. XGvis calls XGobi as a function (Swayne et al., 1991).

Reference-contexts: Potential sources include shortest path distances among vertices in a graph, measured dissimilarity among test objects in a psychometric experiment, and distances among cases in multivariate data. The use of XGvis for graph theory applications is driven by another visualization tool developed at Bell-core. NETPAD <ref> (Dean et al., 1991) </ref> is an interactive program for creating graphs and graph layouts and analyzing these structures with a library of algorithms.

Reference-contexts: We have planned to extend the XGvis system with several other embedding algorithms. Nonmetric MDS (described in Section 2.2) has been used successfully for embedding graphs <ref> (Fairchild et al., 1988) </ref>. Extensions are possible for drawing directed graphs for instance, constraining edges to point down and to the right if possible. It is also possible to add additional terms to Equation 2.1 to encourage MDS to lay out the objects within a certain rough outline.

Reference-contexts: Now we experiment with fitting an explicit dissimilarity matrix. In Figure 9, each point represents a Morse code sequence one for each of the symbols a-z and 0-9. A matrix of confusion rates for these symbols was determined in a psychological experiment by Rothkopf <ref> (see Gnanadesikan, 1977, pg. 44ff for an accessible account) </ref>. To prepare the data for XGvis, we needed to convert the confusion rates the percentage of times one symbol was mistaken for another to dissimilarities. This was accomplished by subtracting each of the confusion rates from 1.

Reference-contexts: That is, if for every two pairs (a,b) and (c,d) of objects it is known whether a is closer to b than c is to d, then a faithful embedding can be constructed. Shepard gave evidence that this is possible and Kruskal <ref> (Kruskal, 1964a, 1964b) </ref> devised an optimization criterion which incorporates this idea. Kruskal defined a measure of fit called "stress" (S).

Reference-contexts: The points are visible in a display window while MDS moves them. When the user is satisfied with the layout, MDS can be stopped and the resulting embedding examined with an integrated version of the XGobi visualization program <ref> (Swayne et al., 1991b, 1991c) </ref>. All interactions take place in two windows on the workstation or personal computer screen. The XGvis control panel window is used to start, stop and restart MDS as well as to control the MDS-related parameters.

Reference-contexts: Adjacent Transposition Graph Creating views of graph structures can be helpful to discrete mathematicians who are generating conjectures about attributes of a mathematical system. Graphs are useful in statistics for representing relationships between data measurements <ref> (Thompson, 1991) </ref>. A good picture of a graph can make important trends in the data more apparent. Creating higher dimensional views of graphs was one of the primary motivations for embarking on the XGvis project.

Most of our efforts were focused on the multidimensional scaling algorithm described in this paper. Our embedding strategy was to make an analogy between shortest path distance in the graph and Euclidean distance in the resulting embedding.
