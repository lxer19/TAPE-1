Title: On Seeing Robots

Abstract: Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (GOFAIR) relies on a set of restrictive Omniscient Fortune Teller Assumptions about the agent, the world and their relationship. The emerging Situated Agent paradigm is challenging GOFAIR by grounding the agent in space and time, relaxing some of those assumptions, proposing new architectures and integrating perception, reasoning and action in behavioral modules. GOFAIR is typically forced to adopt a hybrid architecture for integrating signal-based and symbol-based approaches because of the inherent mismatch between the corresponding on-line and off-line computational models. It is argued that Situated Agents should be designed using a unitary on-line computational model. The Constraint Net model of Zhang and Mackworth satisfies that requirement. Two systems for situated perception built in our laboratory are described to illustrate the new approach: one for visual monitoring of a robot's arm, the other for real-time visual control of multiple robots competing and cooperating in a dynamic world.

Reference-contexts: These categories are not exclusive: I also combine them and discuss robots that see robots and even robots that see themselves. Furthermore, the title is designed to echo, and pay homage to, a classic vision paper entitled On Seeing Things by Max Clowes <ref> [1] </ref> as I have done once before [2]. But the context, the arguments and the conclusions are new; the comparison is used explicitly here to show the difference between the classical approach and an emerging situated approach to robotic perception. <p> So a GOFAIR system consists of three modules for perception, reasoning and action, respectively. (This characterization of a GOFAIR robot is, of course, an unfair but useful caricature.) The paradigmatic environment that a GOFAIR robot inhabits is the blocks world. Clowes <ref> [1] </ref> and many others [4] provided the tools to build perceptual systems that translated arbitrary images of that world to symbolic descriptions for the purposes of reasoning and planning.

Reference-contexts: K. Mackworth 2 Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence and Robotics The phrase Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence (GOFAI) was introduced by Haugeland <ref> [3] </ref> to characterize the classical symbol manipulation approach to AI. In GO-FAI intelligence is identified with reasoning and reasoning with rule-based manipulation of symbolic structures.

Assumption BK (Belief is Knowledge): An agent's beliefs about the world are true and justified.
