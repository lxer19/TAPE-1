Title: ASCII Phonetic Symbols for the World's Languages: Worldbet

Abstract: A new ASCII encoding of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and additional symbols for speech database labeling has been designed for all languages. Many of the previous ASCII versions of the IPA were targeted at European languages and therefore left out many of the sounds of the other languages or used IPA symbols for non-European sounds like clicks, for plosive bursts. When an attempt was made to label a large number of languages with phonemic and phonetic symbols, these were found to be inadequate. The present scheme borrows on earlier work by George Allen, Ian Maddieson, John Wells, Laver et al. and Hieronymus et al. Wherever possible, the present scheme was made similar to the base IPA symbols, so that many of the symbols will seem to have obvious meanings. Many of the symbols are the same as other schemes. The underlying principle is that any spectrally and temporally distinct speech sound (not including pitch) which is phonemic in some language should have a separate base symbol. In most cases the base symbol consists of a concatination of an IPA symbol and diacritics. Thus it is easy to recognize the phonemic base symbols and compare the same broad phonetic sound across languages. Tone languages have diacritics applied to the vowel phoneme symbols to properly identify the phonemes in these languages. Allophonic variations due to contextural coarticulation and stress may be labelled by a diacritic attached to the base symbol. It is possible that some speech sounds which are phonemic in at least one of the world's languages, are missing from the present version. It is hoped that any oversights will be corrected in subsequent versions of Worldbet, and a standard method for constructing new symbols is presented.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, Worldbet base symbols will represent phonemic distinctions in some language, as in the plosive example. The base symbols are thus meant to be broad phonetic, but can be used as surface phonemic symbols within a given language (as stated in the original principles of the IPA <ref> [1] </ref>). Since the IPA has been in use for over 100 years and has been actively developed and evolved over this period [2], it should have all of the phonemic distinctions observed in the world's languages to date.

Therefore it is the natural starting point for any attempt to construct a phoneme set which is sufficient to cover all of the languages in the world.

PHONASCII, the ascii IPA symbol set by George Allen <ref> [4] </ref> is the closest to having the symbols required, but has added symbols for studying speech disorders and child language acquisition. Some of the constructions of affricates had the wrong fricative symbol and some of the monophthong vowels had two character symbols, which makes the construction of diphthongs awkward.

For SAMPA some simpilifying assumptions were made because it was thought that they would be used for transcription within one language, not across languages. <p> The major departure is the inclusion of hyper aspiration for Indian languages and fricated plosives which were found in British English during the labeling of the SCRIBE database <ref> [10] </ref>. Hyper aspiration is meant to be a strong aspiration. This may be the property called breathy voiced aspiration in Hindi, but this is yet to be determined experimentally. It is used to denote strong aspiration, while h denotes ordinary aspiration.

Reference-contexts: This leads to the same symbol being used for quite different sounds, most notably for /r/. An effort for world wide ASCII to IPA coverage by Ian Maddieson <ref> [11] </ref> of UCLA was thought to be too complicated for the present application. It is a more detailed label set aimed at fine phonetic distinctions in all the world's languages. It does not distinguish between diacritics and baseforms. <p> An effort has been made to consistantly assign vowel and consonant symbols. The collection of phonemes from the UCLA Phonological Segment Inventory Database (UPSID) was examined to make sure that Worldbet covered all those used by 10 or more languages listed in Patterns of Sound by Maddieson <ref> [11] </ref>. Monophthong vowels will have base symbols which are usual vowel symbols orthographically (i.e. a, A, o, O) and numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). Most of these will be single printing symbols. <p> The set of all observed phonemes from all the world's languages can be studied. Sets of these phonological elements across all languages are called phonological inventories. These have been collected by Greenberg and Ferguson at Stanford University and by Maddieson amd Ladefoged at UCLA <ref> [11] </ref>. The aim of Worldbet is to include as a baseform all of the elements in the phonological inventory of all the languages of the world. These symbols are created by concatinating the Worldbet ascii IPA set and diacritics to make a phoneme set for each language.

Reference-contexts: A new ascii version for the IPA which has 2 been developed on the sci.lang email news group <ref> [12] </ref> has also been examined, but seems to suffer from too few languages being considered in detail. It is supposed to be used in email discussions of phonetics and phonology. It is a full encoding of the IPA and has some common symbols with Worldbet.
