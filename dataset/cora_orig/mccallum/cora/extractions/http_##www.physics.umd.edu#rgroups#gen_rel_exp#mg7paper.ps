Abstract: A new transducer is proposed for use on a spherical gravitational wave detector. This transducer is similar to a single-stage resonant-mass transducer but uses a lever to get additional amplification beyond that at resonance. Calculations indicate a bandwidth of ~ 10% should be obtainable with this device, more than enough to meet the sensitivity goal for the sphere. A spherical antenna for gravitational wave detection was proposed in the 1970s. 1,2 Recently there has been renewed interest in spherical antennas as the logical next step in resonant-mass gravitational wave detectors and as a complementary system to laser interferometer experiments being built, such as LIGO. 3 Researchers at Stan-ford University, Louisiana State University, the University of Maryland and Rochester University are collaborating to design and build a spherical antenna. To detect as-trophysically interesting events from nearby galaxies with a rate greater than several events per year, a sensitivity goal of h 10 22 has been proposed. To achieve this, a transducer with a fractional bandwidth of at least 5% is needed. To this end, a resonant lever transducer is proposed. This transducer is capable of yielding a 10% fractional bandwidth for a massive spherical antenna, which represents an order of magnitude increase over what has been achieved by operating bar detectors. 4 An equivalent bandwidth from a multi-mode resonant mass transducer would require multiple resonant masses, adding to the complexity of the mechanical design and the mode structure. All these problems are avoided with the lever transducer. The lever transducer was originally conceived by Paik as a non-resonant device to be used on a split bar detector. 2 Upon adapting this idea for use on a sphere, it was found that for non-resonant response the lever required equal masses on either side of it. For a 3 m diameter, 3:9 fi 10 4 kg aluminum sphere, this is impractical. However, used as a resonant transducer, the lever only requires a balancing mass M 0 (see Fig. 1) of
