Reference-contexts: The most significant innovation in this architecture is the efficient support of sparse, wide area groups.

These traditional dense mode multicast schemes were intended for use within regions where a group is widely represented or bandwidth is universally plentiful.

Reference-contexts: Protocol details can be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. draft-ietf-idmr-pim-arch-04.ps 9 2 Requirements We had several design objectives in mind when designing this architecture: * Sparse-Mode Regions We define a sparse mode region as one in which (a) the number of networks/domains with group members present is significantly smaller than number of networks/domains in the region as a whole; <p> The detailed protocol mechanisms are described in <ref> [3] </ref>. As described, traditional multicast routing protocols were optimized for densely distributed groups or uniformly bandwidth-rich regions, and rely on data driven actions in all network routers to establish efficient distribution trees. <p> In other words the PMBR sets up source specific state and sends Registers on behalf of external sources. The details of these mechanisms are described in <ref> [3, 16, 17] </ref>. 4.3 Multicast service interface The multicast interface for hosts is unchanged.

Senders simply use that address as the destination address of a packet to reach all members of the group. <p> source subnetwork, and a router receiving this packet has no knowledge about the group, the router forwards the incoming packet out all interfaces except the incoming interface. (Some schemes reduce draft-ietf-idmr-pim-arch-04.ps 6 the number of outgoing interfaces further by using unicast routing protocol information to keep track of child-parent information <ref> [6, 2] </ref>.)

Reference-contexts: Senders simply use that address as the destination address of a packet to reach all members of the group. The separation of senders and receivers allows any host, member or non-member, to send to a group. A group membership protocol (IGMP) <ref> [7, 8] </ref> is used for routers to learn the existence of members on their directly attached subnetworks.

Reference-contexts: In the case of link-state protocols, changes of group membership on a subnetwork are detected by one of the routers directly attached to that subnetwork, and that router broadcasts the information to all other routers in the same routing domain <ref> [9] </ref>. Each router maintains an up-to-date image of the domain's topology through the unicast link-state routing protocol. Upon receiving a multicast data packet, the router uses the topology information and the group membership information to determine the shortest-path tree (SPT) from the packet's source subnetwork to its destination group members.

Reference-contexts: The other major factor is the processing cost of the Dijkstra shortest-path-tree calculations performed to compute the delivery trees for all active multicast sources <ref> [10] </ref> for all groups, thus limiting its applicability on an internet-wide basis. Distance-vector multicast routing protocols construct multicast distribution trees using variants of Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) [11].

Reference-contexts: Distance-vector multicast routing protocols construct multicast distribution trees using variants of Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) <ref> [11] </ref>. <p> Also if the arriving data packet does not come through the interface that the router uses to send packets to the source of the data packet, the data packet is silently dropped; thus the term Reverse Path Forwarding <ref> [11] </ref>. When a router attached to a leaf subnetwork, receives a data packet addressed to a new group, if it finds no members present on its attached subnetworks, it sends a prune message upstream towards the source of the data packet.

Reference-contexts: However, periodically, the source's packets will be broadcast throughout the entire internet when the pruned-off branches times out. draft-ietf-idmr-pim-arch-04.ps 7 (a) (b) Thus far we have motivated our design by contrasting it to the traditional dense-mode IP multicast routing protocols. The Core Based Tree (CBT) protocol <ref> [13] </ref> was proposed to address similar scaling problems in support of sparse-mode multicast. CBT uses a single delivery tree for each group, rooted at one of a small set of "core" routers and shared by all senders to the group.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the packets traveling from Y to Z will not travel via the shortest path used by unicast packets between Y and Z. We need to know the kind of degradations a core-based tree can incur in average networks. David Wall <ref> [14] </ref> proved that the bound on maximum delay of an optimal core-based tree (which he called a center-based tree) is 2 times the shortest-path delay.

Estrin. </author> <title> The trade-offs of multicast trees and algorithms. </title> <booktitle> In Proceedings of the 1994 international conference on computer communications and networks, </booktitle> <address> San Francisco, </address> <month> September </month> <year> 1994. </year>
Reference-contexts: Note that although some error bars in the delay graph extend below 1, there are no real data points below 1 | the distribution is not symmetric, for more details see <ref> [15] </ref>. For interactive applications where low latency is critical, it is desirable to use the shortest-path trees to avoid the longer delays of an optimal core-based tree. With respect to the potential traffic concentration problem, we also conducted simulations in randomly generated 50-node networks. <p> It would be ideal to flexibly support both types of trees within one multicast architecture, so that the selection of tree types becomes a configuration decision within a multicast protocol. A more complete analysis of these tradeoffs can be found in <ref> [15] </ref>. PIM is designed to address the two issues addressed above: to avoid the overhead of broadcasting packets when group members sparsely populate the internet, and to do so in a way that supports good-quality distribution trees for heterogeneous applications.

Reference-contexts: The timers controlling periodic refreshing of control messages are set such that the total overhead is a small fixed percentage of the link bandwidth. Eventually, PIM should use the scalable timer approach; this approach was initially proposed by Van Jacobson and a detailed design and analysis was reported in <ref> [18] </ref>. In this approach the refresh interval is determined by the sender of the information.
