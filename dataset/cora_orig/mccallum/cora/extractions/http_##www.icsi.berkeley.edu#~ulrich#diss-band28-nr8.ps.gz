Reference-contexts: In addition, there are several indices frequently used in order to describe the correlation in a data stream. In this context, variability refers to the changes in the variance of consecutive interarrival times or in the variance of the arrivals over a time interval. In the literature (e. g. <ref> [AKM + 88, Gus90, GTG91] </ref>), these parameters are especially used to fit the parameters of a stochastic process to a real arrival stream. The definitions below follow Gusella's interpretations in his Ph. D. <p> Furthermore, it is assumed that the random variables X i obey a discrete-time binomial distribution P (X i = k) = b (k; b i ; p) = b i ! (4.5) where p and b i represent the parameters of the binomial distribution. Maglaris et al. in <ref> [AKM + 88] </ref> have shown that the number of bits per video frame follows a symmetric bell-shape distribution. Similar statistical measures are also presented in [HTL92] in which the authors analyze a 30 minute data sequence of a video teleconference. In our studies, the parameter p equals 0:5. <p> The key word ICO represents the required service: isochronous, connection-oriented. This parameter is also optional, and if left out, data is transferred by asynchronous and connectionless services. on the modeling of a video source with an autoregressive process <ref> [VP89, AKM + 88] </ref>. The source has an average bit rate of 3.9 Mbps and a peak rate of 10.5 Mbps.

Reference-contexts: The initial investigations suggested replacing cable with fiber and modifying the MAC protocol to remove speed limitations. This is exactly the idea behind FDDI (see standard document ANSI X3.139 <ref> [Ame87] </ref>) which proposes a multimode fiber ring and a multitoken MAC protocol. Commercial FDDI networks are currently available and are receiving a lot of interest. The need for integration of isochronous services has led to an enhancement of FDDI: a slotted variant called FDDI-II.

Reference-contexts: the respective state transition is (K k + 1; i; 0) ! (K; j; S distance ) and the transition probability is given by P (E 0;over k;i;j ) = p i ! ij m=k+1 The event classes, especially the latter two, are specified for a so-called single rejection policy <ref> [ATG88] </ref>. According to this policy, one part of the batch can be stored while the remaining part is rejected (or lost) if the size of an arriving batch is larger than the number of the available free places in the queue. Another queue admission policy is the batch rejection policy. <p> Because of the same functional relationships of the random variables, the equations for the batch rejection policy are identical, as shown in <ref> [ATG88] </ref>. 66 Queueing Model 1. initialize the distribution u n for n = 1, 2. calculate u + n by the convolution of u n and x n , 3. calculate u n+1 by the convolution of u + n and a n , and 4. repeat step 2 and 3 <p> The modification for the batch rejection policy is presented in <ref> [ATG88, Geh94] </ref>. r The probability of reserved, but unused, bandwidth P unused can be calculated observing the probability that the queue is empty and no arrival occurs at the service instant P unused = u 0 (0) + m X u i (0) (1 p i ) (4.41) The numerical results

Reference-contexts: Through these characteristics, it is possible to achieve better throughput, theoretically eight times more than the capacity of the transmission link <ref> [BG93] </ref>. The cell-based transfer mode in CRMA-II supports compatibility to ATM and suitability as a backbone network. CRMA-II slots 24 Background (68 byte long) do not have the same format as ATM cells, but the slot payload (53 byte) can carry an ATM cell. <p> Because of this, timing was achieved in an decentralized manner [vALS93]. The integration of isochronous services [vAL94, GU94] is based on a centralized clock (in an ideal case located in the scheduler) by using framing periods. Several papers <ref> [vALZZ91, vALZ92, vALS93, BG93, Meu93, Meu94] </ref> are concerned with the performance evaluation of connectionless asynchronous services in CRMA-II and can be referenced for more detailed information about the MAC mechanism provided by CRMA-II.

Reference-contexts: Already in the 1970's, there were many investigations concerning the adequate description of speech patterns. In 1968, Brady published an statistical analysis of 16 experimental telephone conversations <ref> [Bra68] </ref>. These experiments show that each participant in a phone conversation occupies the channel for less than half of its duration.

Reference-contexts: Based on these results, Brady developed a two-phase Markov Chain with exponential distributed state sojourn times representing the speech behavior of individuals partaking in a dialogue <ref> [Bra69] </ref>. The proposed on-off, or talkspurt-silence, model 2 builds the basis of a variety of later research work on the specification of voice sources [LM85, LM88, HL86, MR92, SSRR92].

Performance Evaluation, </title> <booktitle> 21 </booktitle> <pages> 37-58, </pages> <year> 1994. </year>
Reference-contexts: Because of its simple tractability, the on-off models are also employed to model approximately other source types or the superimposed voice, video, and data traffic (see e. g. <ref> [BSX94, LL92, LL93, FW93] </ref>). Recent queueing theory research focuses particularly on the powerful generalized on-off process class, the Markov Renewal Processes (MRP) [HS82]. This process class allows different distributions of interarrival times to be modeled.

Reference-contexts: Because of these disadvantages several dynamic approaches to react adaptively to the changes in the traffic behavior as well as to altering network capabilities are investigated in recent literature (e. g. <ref> [Sri93, NS94, CLG94] </ref>). In [NS94], Smith and Nahrstedt propose a methodology for better information exchange between application and network using negotiation and renegotiation. They separate the transmission time of complex and time intensive applications into intervals (eras) in which service requirements are constant. <p> A new era then begins after the renegotiation. By using a set of QOS parameters 1 , a "correctness condition" is formulated with which an optimal allocation decision is possible. In a similar manner, a dynamic bandwidth allocation approach for VBR video traffic only is presented in <ref> [CLG94] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The critical problem is related to combining connectionless (predominant in LAN/MAN) and connection-oriented services (offered by ATM). One possible approach in ATM LAN implementations (e. g. FALCON <ref> [DBT93] </ref>) is LAN emulation through the use of hubs. Physical links between hubs allow mutual interconnections of end systems over a logical ring.

Reference-contexts: At the current state, the remaining free parameters, 2 , b 1 , b 2 and ! ij , are arbitrarily chosen by the model user. A large number of test studies have shown that the entire model behavior is insensitive with respect to these free parameters (see thesis <ref> [Kun93, Def94, Geh94, Sch94b, Vor95] </ref>). <p> This queue admission policy is also implemented for the numerical analysis of the queue. All results, which are focused on the single rejection policy, are contained in the master theses <ref> [Def94, Geh94, Sch94b] </ref>. 4.4 Steady State Model Analysis Complex queueing models frequently have no closed form solution, or it solved by the analyzing Markov Chain are analytically intractable because of the "state space explosion". Exact numerical evaluation is therefore often inapplicable because of the time and space complexity. <p> At this level, some sources (especially voice sources) alternate between two phases: on and off.

Reference-contexts: Scalability cannot be realized in a cost-effective manner by using central ATM switches because of the limited number of input and output links. In order to realize decentralized switches, an alternative is to connect switches over a shared medium ring, discussed in more detail in <ref> [DeP93, DK93] </ref>. The major drawback of switched architectures is the difficulty in supporting isochronous services due to the lack of a central clock. In contrast, the central slot generator station in a shared medium structure makes these systems very attractive for isochronous services. <p> This includes segmentation and reassembling, which are associated with the functionalities of the transport layer (layer 4) in the OSI model. Detailed information relating to broadband ATM networks is available in the basic literature, e. g. <ref> [DeP93, JBK94] </ref>. 2.3 Slotted High Speed Networks 19 2.3.2 Shared Medium Backbone Networks The growing interest in interconnecting communication systems for high speed data transfer has motivated the development of high speed LANs and MANs.

Reference-contexts: (2.7) 4 The operator dxe returns the least integer value greater than or equal to x. 20 Background where C is the available transmission capacity [bit/s], F is the duration of a frame [second/frame], S size is the slot size [byte/slot], and is the coding factor used for reliability purposes <ref> [DHL + 92] </ref>. The bit coding algorithm ensures the bit transfer robustness. In the following example, 8=10 bit coding ( = 8 10 ) is considered. <p> Datex-M enables multi- and broadcast communication of customers by the group address configuration as virtual private networks. In addition, the isochronous services can be used to integrate voice or video devices in the data communication environment. Another very efficient reservation-based network is CRMA (cyclic reservation multiple access <ref> [Nas90, DHL + 92] </ref>), which is implemented as a prototype by IBM Zurich Research Lab with a target speed of 1.13 Gbps. CRMA combines a simple busy/free access (so-called gratis access) with a reservation scheme that allows fair access and bounded delay in heavy traffic situations.

Reference-contexts: As traffic behavior is known in more detail, the optimal resource usage can be planned.

It should be noted that the loss and delay tolerance ratios are related to the fixed size packets (cells) with a payload of 48 bytes.

Reference-contexts: The simulation tool is implemented for a slotted ring high speed network and is presented in more detail in Section 6.2. The statistical evaluation is performed by using a C++ implementation of the batch-mean-value method <ref> [GJW93] </ref> which delivers the first and second moments of sample series. Some results relating to different network utilizations are listed in Table 4.5, where the simulation program is configured for a network with 32 independent active stations. The simulation test configuration is the same as that presented in Section 6.2.1. <p> The results coincide much better if the simulation runs longer, and the simulation process reaches the steady state. Therefore the results achieved are influenced in most cases by the simulation time. The studies presented above are performed with a confidence interval of 95% using the batch-mean-value method <ref> [GJW93] </ref>. Altogether, 10; 000 samples are surveyed, where the relative errors of the samples amount to 45% up to 65%. Considering the run time behavior of both approaches, UWA is far better. <p> These files can be evaluated, and the performance measures can then represented in tabular, graph or textual form. Figure 6.1 schematically illustrates a simulation process by OSSCAR. The load-machine-model is implemented in OSSCAR by using object-oriented programming and event-driven simulation technique supported by the CNCL class library <ref> [GJW93] </ref>. The basic components in CNCL are the so-called EventHandler objects communicating through Events. An EventHandler shows the same behavior as a finite state machine. Receiving an Event leads to a state change in the EventHandler and could cause the generation of one (or more) Event (s).

Reference-contexts: Additionally, all CRMA-II concepts can be applied to ATM cells without any difficulties. Originally, CRMA was introduced as a MAC protocol for Gbps LAN/MANs to support high performance data communication. Because of this, timing was achieved in an decentralized manner [vALS93]. The integration of isochronous services <ref> [vAL94, GU94] </ref> is based on a centralized clock (in an ideal case located in the scheduler) by using framing periods. <p> In [vAL94], an isochronous operation mode for dynamic embedding of isochronous channels into the well-known asynchronous operations mode of CRMA-II is proposed. The resource management facilities are not discussed in this paper and a peak rate bandwidth allocation is suggested. <ref> [GU94] </ref> is focused on this critical problem of resource reservation in a case study based on CRMA-II. In summary, one can say that the broad- and multicast facilities as well as the isochronous services make shared medium structures attractive to LANs and MANs. <p> The performance experienced by established channels is not influenced by the various assignment strategies, since the negotiating performance parameters remain constant in each case during a connection. 3.5 Impact of the Network Topology 41 3.5 Impact of the Network Topology The reservoir scheme is applied in <ref> [GU94] </ref> to an extension of the CRMA-II protocol with a new service class for sensitive traffic. The protocol modification adapts to the known principles of CRMA-II and requires no changes to the way asynchronous services are provided.

Reference-contexts: Discrete-time observation of the buffer requires a management policies which relates to simultaneous arrival and service (queue departure) events. Two different buffer management policies are proposed in the literature <ref> [Her93a] </ref> for consistency when specifying the state space: r arrival first (AF), arrivals are considered before the service is taken into account, and r departure first (DF), a service event takes place before an arrival. These policies are illustrated in Figure 4.5, where the dashed slots show simultaneous events.

Reference-contexts: a very similar process to the MAP, the so-called Phase Markovian Renewal Process (PH-MRP). 48 Queueing Model The last two features are, in particular, very interesting for describing heterogeneous superimposed traffic in queueing models of ATM multiplexers (see e. g. [Bou91, SKY91]). r Discrete Markovian Arrival Process (DMAP) A DMAP <ref> [BKT91, BC92, Her93b, GC94] </ref> is the discrete analogous of the MAP when discrete-time is more appropriate, e. g. in slotted systems when an arrival and/or the corresponding service can occur only in discrete-time domain.

Reference-contexts: The proposed on-off, or talkspurt-silence, model 2 builds the basis of a variety of later research work on the specification of voice sources <ref> [LM85, LM88, HL86, MR92, SSRR92] </ref>. Because of its simple tractability, the on-off models are also employed to model approximately other source types or the superimposed voice, video, and data traffic (see e. g. [BSX94, LL92, LL93, FW93]). <p> Arrivals correspond to a transition from a transient state to the absorption state with a phase dependent probability. The process then restarts instantaneously from a new transient state. The n-phase Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP (n) ) is a special case of the MAP as shown formally in <ref> [FMH93, HL86] </ref>. The MMPP (n) is comprised of a double Poisson Process.

Reference-contexts: Recent queueing theory research focuses particularly on the powerful generalized on-off process class, the Markov Renewal Processes (MRP) <ref> [HS82] </ref>. This process class allows different distributions of interarrival times to be modeled. The resulting queueing models provide a suitable specification of the correlated VBR traffic while still remaining tractable. The underlying arrival process in the queueing model of the reservoir scheme also belongs to this class of stochastic processes.

Reference-contexts: The most common implementation of the reservation-based networks is DQDB (distributed queue dual bus) which is standardized as IEEE 802.6 <ref> [IEE90] </ref>. A DQDB network is based on a dual bus topology. The buses are unidirectional and operate in opposite directions. For reliability purposes, the facilities of bus end points can be collected in one station. <p> Network simulators of OSSCAR are built from the composition of particular classes by the configurator object and represent models for the network components and their interactions. OSSCAR currently provides network simulators for the DQDB protocol (according to the IEEE 802.6 <ref> [IEE90] </ref>), CRMA-II (proposed in [vALS93]), ATM (ITU recommendation 1.150 [ITU90a]) and a variety of C++ classes for resource management using the reservoir scheme. <p> With applications demanding smaller capacity, a single slot can be segmented in 64 kbps isochronous channels as proposed in <ref> [IEE90] </ref>. The reservation task of these VCs can be managed in the same manner as for static reserved slots in the reservoir scheme (see master's thesis [Sch94b]).

Reference-contexts: With these dynamic approaches, adaption to the requirements or to the resource availability lead to better performance, but the improved efficiency is accompanied by large communication and computational overhead. Many other dynamic methods for ATM networks have been reported in recent literature <ref> [LR94, IEE94] </ref>. In most cases, ATM features (cell multiplexing and asynchronous network access) are required. The applicability of these methods in reservation-based shared medium environments necessitates fundamental modifications. In such networks, the guaranteed bandwidth is ensured by the central marking of slots as one virtual channel (VC).

Reference-contexts: Because of this, guaranteed services imply resource reservation to achieve the desired performance. In order to maintain the negotiated QOS for all existing connections, a new request can be rejected if the network cannot fulfill the application's requirements. ITU (international telecommunication union formerly CCITT) recommendation I.362 <ref> [ITU90b] </ref> has proposed four service classes which have to be supported by integrated service high speed networks.

Reference-contexts: In this way, connectionless services are simulated over permanent connections between connectionless servers. Higher flexibility can be achieved as the servers establish connections dynamically. But in this case, call processing delays should be taken into account. An overview of the different approaches can be found in <ref> [JBK94] </ref>. The high requirements on LAN's scalability pose additional challenges in the realization of switch-based LANs. Scalability cannot be realized in a cost-effective manner by using central ATM switches because of the limited number of input and output links. <p> This includes segmentation and reassembling, which are associated with the functionalities of the transport layer (layer 4) in the OSI model.

Reference-contexts: Datex-M enables multi- and broadcast communication of customers by the group address configuration as virtual private networks. In addition, the isochronous services can be used to integrate voice or video devices in the data communication environment. Another very efficient reservation-based network is CRMA (cyclic reservation multiple access <ref> [Nas90, DHL + 92] </ref>), which is implemented as a prototype by IBM Zurich Research Lab with a target speed of 1.13 Gbps. CRMA combines a simple busy/free access (so-called gratis access) with a reservation scheme that allows fair access and bounded delay in heavy traffic situations.

Reference-contexts: The protocol modification adapts to the known principles of CRMA-II and requires no changes to the way asynchronous services are provided. The performance evaluation of the reservoir scheme is started using an isochronous assignment strategy. In a similar manner, the reservoir scheme is surveyed for DQDB networks in <ref> [Sch94b] </ref>. The universality of the scheme is ensured through the central management of guaranteed and asynchronous services. The scheme is based on central clocking by the slot generator. The bandwidth management facilities are achieved centrally by the BM . <p> At the current state, the remaining free parameters, 2 , b 1 , b 2 and ! ij , are arbitrarily chosen by the model user. A large number of test studies have shown that the entire model behavior is insensitive with respect to these free parameters (see thesis <ref> [Kun93, Def94, Geh94, Sch94b, Vor95] </ref>). <p> This queue admission policy is also implemented for the numerical analysis of the queue. All results, which are focused on the single rejection policy, are contained in the master theses <ref> [Def94, Geh94, Sch94b] </ref>. 4.4 Steady State Model Analysis Complex queueing models frequently have no closed form solution, or it solved by the analyzing Markov Chain are analytically intractable because of the "state space explosion". Exact numerical evaluation is therefore often inapplicable because of the time and space complexity. <p> The simulation of the MMBP [X] (3) =D=1 K model is performed by using the class library OSSCAR (see Chapter 6). Several case studies related to the comparison of the analytical and simulation results are introduced in the theses <ref> [Sch94b, Vor95] </ref>. As far as the queue length distribution are concerned, simulation measurements differ negligibly from the analytical results. This behavior is illustrated for the first load scenario in Figure 5.5. <p> With applications demanding smaller capacity, a single slot can be segmented in 64 kbps isochronous channels as proposed in [IEE90]. The reservation task of these VCs can be managed in the same manner as for static reserved slots in the reservoir scheme (see master's thesis <ref> [Sch94b] </ref>). However, the introduction of different VC classes requires an extension of the management facilities for the establishment and release of connections. r The fitting procedure for the proposed MMBP [X] (3) source model can be supported by a statistical analysis of the measured data streams.

Reference-contexts: A possible solution for the remarking problem in a single ring is based on using an insertion buffer in the slot generator station. In conflict situations, busy gratis slots can be temporarily stored in this buffer. Some implementation guidelines relating to this solution are proposed in <ref> [Sch95] </ref>. 3.6 Modeling the Reservoir Scheme Detailed investigation concerning critical issues and to evaluate the reservoir scheme is performed using queueing theory and a simulation testbed. <p> The estimation of the service quality experienced with a certain reservation parameter is performed by developing and analyzing 7 The simulation testbed is also used for design studies related to the implementations of the network component bandwidth manager (BM) (see <ref> [Sch95] </ref>). 44 The Reservoir Scheme a queueing model. In addition, a simulation testbed is designed and implemented which permits to consider complex interactions between different service users. <p> As mentioned there, the problem can be overcome by using an insertion buffer in the slot generator station for temporarily storage of the busy gratis slots.

Reference-contexts: Detailed investigations of the reservoir scheme are performed through developing and analyzing a discrete-time queueing model: MMBP [X] (3) =D=1 K. In this model, a 3-phase Markov Modulated Bernoulli Process with batch arrivals is used to specify correlated VBR traffic. The queue is analyzed using the "unfinished work" approach <ref> [TG88] </ref>. The achieved numerical results then give information about the expected performance values in case of the static bandwidth reservation step. In order to determine the performance improvement by dynamically using the reservoir range, the queueing model is extended by considering the reservoir range variation dependent on the network utilization. <p> However, this requires approximations relating to the time observation and is not in accordance with the objectives of discrete-time modeling. The steady state analysis of the queueing model developed here is performed using an iterative approach which is presented by Tran-Gia in <ref> [TG88] </ref> to analyze G=G=1 K queueing systems in a discrete-time domain. Unlike various standard methods operating in the continuous-time domain, this approach does not make use of the transition matrix and the solution of linear equation systems. <p> By using these techniques, the problems of computational time and memory requirements can be overcome. The process is characterized by the stochastic description of the unfinished work in the system, and provides an elegant method to derive the 7 Refer to <ref> [TG88] </ref> Section 3.3 for more detail. 4.4 Steady State Model Analysis 63 queue length distribution directly from the probability mass function of the unfinished work. Other performance measures, such as loss probability, can then be easily derived from the queue length probability. <p> The number of the phases considered is a compromise between the model accuracy and its tractability. The proposed queueing model is analyzed applying the unfinished work approach (UWA) <ref> [TG88] </ref>. UWA can also be used to analyze MMBP (m) with an arbitrary number of phases. Regarding the dynamic allocation step in the reservoir scheme, the queueing model was extended to account for gratis slot access. Using this additional slot access means that the user will experience better performance values. <p> The model analysis is performed using a discrete-time approach based on the "unfinished work" method proposed by Tran-Gia in <ref> [TG88] </ref>. The analysis tool implemented allows us to evaluate queueing models with each arbitrary m-phase MMBP arrival process in a computational efficient manner.

Reference-contexts: Free and unreserved slots can be accessed by each node. Fair slot access is ensured by a complex but efficient scheduling algorithm implemented in a central node acting as the network scheduler. The reservation requests and confirmations are sent as broadcast command slots from/to the scheduler. The CRMA-II <ref> [vALZ92] </ref> extension has in addition proposed an insertion buffer mechanism. In this way, each node is able to send slots consecutively (multislot) by holding up the slot stream on the medium. A multislot sending process is, however, allowed if the insertion buffer is empty before the next slot is transmitted. <p> Because of this, timing was achieved in an decentralized manner [vALS93].
