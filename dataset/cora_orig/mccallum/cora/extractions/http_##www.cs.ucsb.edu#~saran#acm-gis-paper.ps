Abstract: Modeling scientific applications requires a seamless integration of an extensible collection of external software tools and data stores, whose formats and behavior cannot be fixed a priori. This paper presents a system that supports a generic and comprehensive interface for scientific modeling, especially targeted to geographic and hydrological research. We illustrate how meta-level concepts can be used to provide a uniform environment in which a user may access and manipulate external resources while being shielded from irrelevant computational and distribution issues.

Reference-contexts: Due to the hierarchical nature of the relationships between R-structures and the association of transformations with specific R-structures, the CMS data model lends itself to a convenient implementation based on object-oriented approaches following the ODMG specifications <ref> [Car94] </ref>. Object-oriented technology has been used in the development of techniques for integration of heterogeneous data management systems. In particular, [EBS94] shows that the object paradigm not only solves the integration problems but also extends its scope.

Reference-contexts: The CME is supported through a visual interface in Amazonia as shown in Figure 3. The user has the ease of creating, accessing and manipulating R-structures corresponding to different concepts like rainfall, DEMs, vegetation as shown in Figure 1. Models are created through the Flowchart Manager <ref> [Che95] </ref> using the instances of R-structures defined above. 5 Distributed Resource Management System (DRAS) The DRAS has been designed to provide access to external data and tools in a distributed environment.

Reference-contexts: A promising and general approach to integration is offered by the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) [Gro92] of the Object Management Group (OMG) [ea94]. The functionality offered by CORBA, however, is not yet complete. Current efforts are focussed on value-added services to augment the basic ORB. In <ref> [CHMP93] </ref>, the notion of computational proxies is introduced. The system however, lacks support for accessing resources distributed on a network. Also, the system is tailored towards Chemical and Molecular Sciences and involves considerable custom code.

Reference-contexts: Object-oriented technology has been used in the development of techniques for integration of heterogeneous data management systems. In particular, <ref> [EBS94] </ref> shows that the object paradigm not only solves the integration problems but also extends its scope. In implementing Amazonia we used the OODBMS O 2 [LRV88] because it supports ODMG 93. <p> An invocation of the ARV (external data) causes the execution of the filter, thus producing data in the format which can be imported by O 2 . Various other intermediate formats have been proposed to solve the semantic heterogeniety problem, e.g., <ref> [EBS94] </ref> discusses formats for integration of heterogeneous database systems. Each ARV has to be created, like all other R-structures, by the user. We believe that this activity could be performed in a batch process by a system administrator rather than the scientist itself.

Reference-contexts: InfoHarness [SMST94] developed by Bellcore provides access to distributed information through encapsulation, using HTTP. However, for standard software packages no generalized tool interface exists. Similarly, OmniPort <ref> [FS94] </ref> offers consistent, single-query access to distributed data and a mechanism to analyze it. However, no support for legacy systems or external tools is provided. Furthermore, there are systems that deal exclusively with the integration of tools, without a conceptual basis for organizing application data.

This complexity is typically managed by decomposing the model into components. The model illustrated in Figure 1, for example, involves erosion and discharge components.

Reference-contexts: We term this component the distributed resource access system (DRAS). In relation to the first component, we described in <ref> [SSE + 95] </ref> a conceptualization of scientific modeling activities that provides a basis for a CME. In particular, this basis involves the concept of representational structures (R-structures) for representing and manipulating scientific modeling concepts at appropriate levels of abstraction. <p> Further details can be found in <ref> [SSE + 95] </ref>. With this conceptual basis in place, we now discuss the implementation issues and system features that assist in providing interoperability. R-structures provide a language for constructing and manipulating representations of concepts and are the foundation on which the modeling environment of a CMS is constructed.

Reference-contexts: To overcome this, it uses the UNIX concept of pseudo-terminals which ensures that the integration of any software that supports a standard I/O interface can be integrated into the system with ease. Further details of the TMS can be found in <ref> [SSS94] </ref>. The DAS forms the lowest level of the Amazonia architecture, as shown in Figure 2. It deals with the idiosyncrasies of accessing information scattered across the network. Given the nature and characteristics of scientific data, any realistic approach to the problem of data access, precludes a centralized solution.
