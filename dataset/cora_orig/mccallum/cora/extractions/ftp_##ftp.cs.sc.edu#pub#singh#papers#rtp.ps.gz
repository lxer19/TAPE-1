Abstract: In this paper, we identify limitations of the real-time protocol (RTP) regarding mobile networking and low-speed links and propose solutions to these problems. In particular, we propose schemes to limit the bandwidth used on the wireless link by RTP data messages and RTCP control messages.

Reference-contexts: Each sender and receiver report is sent to every participant of the RTP connection. However, the RTCP bandwidth is constrained to some percentage of the total session (data plus control) bandwidth; 5% is suggested in <ref> [1] </ref>. This control bandwidth is split up amongst all the participants and determines the rate at which they generate sender and receiver reports. 3 Mobile Networks In order to provide high bandwidths to mobile users, geographic areas are split up into cells. <p> If a mobile host joins this conference, in order to receive the data in a timely manner, it would have to be the sole user of a high-end wireless LAN. A mobile user connected via CDPD would see enormous and unacceptable delays. <ref> [1] </ref> suggests that a RTP mixer might be used to reduce the data bandwidth for slow connections. We propose the design for such a mixer below. However, reducing the data bandwidth is not enough. <p> The overview report may be implemented as a profile specific header extension to a standard receiver report. 7 Future Work and Conclusions The method for calculating the session bandwidth is not specified in <ref> [1] </ref>, but the assumption appears to be that it is some bandwidth times the number of participants. To properly include mobile users, the specific bandwidth used by each participant should be part of the calculation.

Reference-contexts: The packet type specifies the scheme used to packetize the data, and this may be used to find the boundaries of logical segments within the data stream. In the common case, one application data unit (ADU) corresponds to one RTP packet making discarding fast and simple. The MPEG-1 profile <ref> [2] </ref>, however, allows a large ADU to span up to 3 RTP packets. The boundaries of the packet are marked in a standard way though, which will allow LPTSL to discard appropriately. LPTSL also supports different discard functions.

Reference-contexts: The mobile hosts (MH) communicate over the wireless medium with a mobile support station (MSS) 1 Extensions to RTP to support Mobile Networking: Brown, Singh 2 within the cell. In our proposed architecture <ref> [3] </ref>, we add a third level to this hierarchy. A supervisor host (SH) controls several MSSs and provides connectivity to the fixed or wired network. The SH provides services to the MH including routing, flow control, and maintenance of quality of service (QOS) guarantees.

Reference-contexts: The SH, along with the MSSs and MHs which it controls, make up a mobile subnetwork. We have proposed that protocols optimized for mobility be used on the mobile subnetwork to insulate the fixed network from the high error rates and frequent disconnections that characterize the wireless environment <ref> [4] </ref>. In particular, the SH maintains bandwidth allocation information about each of the MH's connections. <p> Since the bandwidth allocated to a mobile user changes dynamically, we propose that the maximum bandwidth a mobile user might receive be used in the calculation. In keeping with the design philosophy cited in <ref> [4] </ref>, an explicit division of the RTP connection at the SH may be warranted. This split would allow an asymmetric protocol, which is optimized to support mobility, to be used on the mobile subnet.

Reference-contexts: Hence recoding will be done to get a data bandwidth which is close to the bandwidth available to the MH. Then the SH will use a variation of the Loss Profile Transport Sub-Layer (LPTSL) <ref> [5] </ref> to judiciously discard data and produce an output data throughput which can feasibly be sent to the MH. Since random loss of data can cause complete failure in some application protocols, LPTSL throws out logical segments to ensure an x% reduction in bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: The bandwidth allocated to each MH in a SH's domain changes dynamically due to reception quality, and there may be many MHs in a SH's domain. As a result, the SH may choose to do a hierarchical recoding <ref> [6] </ref> which would allow it to do one recoding but to transmit output of varying quality and bandwidth requirements to different MHs.
