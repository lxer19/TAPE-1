Reference-contexts: All edges of the complete bipartite geometric graph (V 1 [ V 2 ; V 1 fi V 2 ) are colored by the same color: red, if V 1 corresponds to elements of Q + (t), and blue, otherwise. It is well-known (e.g., see <ref> [AGHN97] </ref>) that if V 1 , jV 1 j m+1 2 , is separated by a line from V 2 , jV 2 j m+1 2 , then the graph (V 1 [ V 2 ; V 1 fi V 2 ) contains a non-crossing path of length m, a contradiction.

Reference-contexts: The 2 segments determined by n points in the plane, no three of which are collinear, form a complete geometric graph with n vertices (see [PA95]). In classical Ramsey theory, we want to find large monochromatic subgraphs in a complete graph whose edges are colored with several colors <ref> [B74] </ref>, [GRS90]. Most questions of this type can be formulated for complete geometric graphs, where the monochromatic subgraphs are required to satisfy certain geometric conditions. The investigation of these problems was initiated in [KPT96].

Reference-contexts: non-crossing triangles of the same color in any complete geometric graph of n = 7k 1 vertices, whose edges are colored with two colors, provided that k is a power of 2. (Note that in an abstract graph, one can always find bn=5c pairwise vertex-disjoint triangles of the same color <ref> [BES75] </ref>.) The paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 contain the proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Define a partial ordering of the vertices p 1 ; p 2 ; : : : ; p (k1)(k2)+1 , as follows. Let p i &lt; p j if i &lt; j and there is a monotone red path connecting p i to p j . By Dilworth's theorem <ref> [D50] </ref>, there are either k 1 elements that form a totally ordered subset, or k elements that are pairwise incomparable.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to see that all i-sets can be generated by the following procedure <ref> [ELSS73] </ref>: Take an oriented line ` passing through precisely one point p 2 P and having i elements of P on its left side. Rotate ` around p in the clockwise direction until it hits another point q 2 P , and then continue the rotation around q, etc.

Reference-contexts: In the second case, there is a complete blue subgraph of k vertices q 1 ; q 2 ; : : : ; q k because any two incomparable elements are connected by a blue edge. By a result of Gritzmann et al. <ref> [GMPP91, PA95] </ref>, this contains a non-crossing cycle of length k, triangulated from a vertex. 2 3 Paths Proof of Theorem 1.2 Let G be a complete geometric graph whose edges are colored red and blue. Suppose that G contains no monochromatic non-crossing path of length m.

Reference-contexts: Most questions of this type can be formulated for complete geometric graphs, where the monochromatic subgraphs are required to satisfy certain geometric conditions. The investigation of these problems was initiated in <ref> [KPT96] </ref>. A subgraph of a geometric graph is said to be non-crossing, if no two of its edges have an interior point in common. In the present paper, we show how to find large non-crossing monochromatic paths and cycles in a geometric graph whose edges are colored with two colors. <p> Theorem 1.2 For any 2-coloring of the edges of a complete geometric graph with n vertices, there exists a non-crossing path of length (n 2=3 ), all of whose edges are of the same color. The last result improves the bound (n 1=2 ) established in <ref> [KPT96] </ref>. It is very likely that the (n 2=3 ) bound in Theorem 1.2 can be further improved to (nearly) linear. We can verify this conjecture for convex geometric graphs, i.e., for geometric graphs whose n points form the vertex set of a convex polygon.

Reference-contexts: The following theorem shows that this result cannot be improved. Theorem 1.6 Let T denote the class of triangles and let k be a positive integer. Then R (k) := R (kT ) (R (T ) + 1)k 1 = 7k 1 : Using the approach of <ref> [KPTT97] </ref>, one can design an O (n log log n+2 )-time algorithm to find k pairwise non-crossing triangles of the same color in any complete geometric graph of n = 7k 1 vertices, whose edges are colored with two colors, provided that k is a power of 2.
