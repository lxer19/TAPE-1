Abstract: Technical Report CACR-141, Center for Advanced Computing Research, April 1997 Abstract Metacomputing--the concurrent use of multiple network-linked computers for solving application problems--is gaining increasing popularity. Much of the early work in metacomputing focused on harnessing greater processing power than could be found at a single site or on combining heterogeneous computer architectures to exploit the best features of each for a given problem. Another compelling rationale for using metacomputing is the acquisition, manipulation, and analysis of data that are stored remotely or acquired by distant instruments. When the data to be accessed and processed are voluminous, we refer to the applications as data intensive. This paper describes three Caltech projects that take advantage of metacomputing, are data-intensive, or both. Brief mention is also made of a few additional projects that have these characteristics and are being conducted elsewhere. The applications described include synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data processing; a user interface for controlling the access and processing of scientific data and the use of distributed archives and computers for that data; and large-scale distributed interactive simulations for synthetic theater of war. Since Caltech is not the only institution that is pursuing distributed, data-intensive metacomputing, we also provide examples of interesting projects from other sites, such as telemicroscopy at the University of California at San Diego and the Distributed Object Computation Testbed that is being developed at the San Diego Supercomputer Center.
