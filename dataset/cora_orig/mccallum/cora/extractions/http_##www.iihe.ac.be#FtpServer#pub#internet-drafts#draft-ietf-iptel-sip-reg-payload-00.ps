Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.

Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as work in progress. Abstract Several newly developed languages and interfaces, such as the CPL and SIP CGI, allow users or administrators to specify how Internet telephony servers should process calls. There needs to be a method of transporting scripts for such languages between a client and a server. This document proposes using the payload of SIP REGISTER messages, and their responses, as one method to transport them.

Scripts typically can be created on a client, but executed on an Internet telephony server.

Scripts typically can be created on a client, but executed on an Internet telephony server. <p> Note that he is transmitting both a contact address, which persists only for 30 minutes, the time specified by the Expires header, and a script, which persists indefinitely. This allows him subsequently to register new contact addresses and have his script apply equally to them. (See <ref> [2] </ref> for an explanation of SIP CGI as used in the script.) The use of Basic authorization here is for the purposes of the example only; in actual practice much more robust authentication SHOULD be used. See section 5.

Reference-contexts: This method INTERNET-DRAFT draft-ietf-iptel-sip-reg-payload-00.ps February 23, 1999 should integrate cleanly with the existing infrastructure of Internet telephony, without requiring significant additional protocol traffic or complexity in either a client or a server. This document proposes using the payload of SIP <ref> [3] </ref> REGISTER messages, and their responses, as the media to transport these scripts to SIP registration servers alongside the user's registration. <p> Bodies of SIP requests are described in <ref> [3] </ref>. The Content-Type header field is set to the media type of the submitted script. Currently, we expect to register application/sip-cgi as the content type for SIP CGI scripts, and application/cpl for CPL scripts.

Reference-contexts: Since clients typically will need to register anyway, and servers will need to have registrars to process the clients' registrations, this technique does not impose much additional overhead on servers and clients. This technique is not appropriate for all environments most obviously, it is not useful for H.323 <ref> [4] </ref> servers and we do not anticipate that it will be the only such transport mechanism developed.
