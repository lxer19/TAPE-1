Abstract: This paper studies the effects of handset distortion on telephone-based speaker recognition performance, resulting in the following observations: (1) the major factor in speaker recognition errors is whether the handset type (e.g., electret, carbon) is different across training and testing, not whether the telephone lines are mismatched, (2) the distribution of speaker recognition scores for true speakers is bimodal, with one mode dominated by matched handset tests and the other by mismatched handsets, (3) cohort-based normalization methods derive much of their performance gains from implicitly selecting cohorts trained with the same handset type as the claimant, and (4) utilizing a handset-dependent background model which is matched to the handset type of the claimant's training data sharpens and separates the true and false speaker score distributions. Results on the 1996 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation corpus show that using handset-matched background models reduces false acceptances (at a 10% miss rate) by more than 60% over previously reported (handset-independent) approaches.

Reference-contexts: Recently, however, research has been conducted suggesting that a significant part of the degradation might be attributed to a mismatch in handset types between training and testing (e.g., training on carbon button handsets only, but testing on electrets) <ref> [1] </ref>. Several well-established compensation techniques, including cepstral mean subtraction and delta coefficients as well as the newer RASTA filtering [2], have been applied to speaker recognition to compensate for channel and handset mismatches. <p> (expectation maximization) GMMs to represent the acoustic parameter distribution of each claimant speaker, p ( ~x t j k ) = i=1 k k where p i k and b i k are the mixture weight and the Gaussian density for the i-th mixture out of M for speaker k <ref> [1] </ref>. The acoustic parameters are 17th order mel-cepstra, with the zeroth-order term removed. The mel-cepstra are computed from a sliding 25 ms frame of speech, with a fram-erate of 10 ms. Cepstral mean subtraction is used in all experiments reported in this paper. <p> The use of handset-dependent models is motivated by the fact that models built from carbon handset data have shifted and scaled score distributions as compared to distributions from models built using electret handset data <ref> [1] </ref>. Our goal is to normalize variability due to handset effects by computing differences between scores from claimant models and composite models trained on the same handset type. <p> Table 3 compares the H-Composite method to cohort-based methods. Cohort normalization uses one or more speaker-dependent impostor models as the background model. The methods include "Cohort" (one cohort), 10 closest cohorts, and 10 maximally spread closest (10-msc) cohorts <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. The total number of Gaussians used to normalize each target speaker for the H-Composite, Composite and the 10 closest and maximally spread cohorts is the same (1280 Gaussians) 1 . All of the methods yield significant improvement over the unnormalized scores (no background model).

Reference-contexts: Several well-established compensation techniques, including cepstral mean subtraction and delta coefficients as well as the newer RASTA filtering <ref> [2] </ref>, have been applied to speaker recognition to compensate for channel and handset mismatches. While these methods can effectively compensate for linear channel distortions, they are generally less effective in treating the handset mismatch problem. We present a new compensation method that significantly reduces the adverse effects of handset mismatch.

Reference-contexts: Rather than comparing scores of a speaker whose identity is claimed (claimant) to scores of a set of "cohort" speakers, the method compares claimant scores with a speaker-independent "composite" model similar to the large random pooled model used in <ref> [3] </ref>. However, instead of using random speakers to build the composite model, we explicitly focus on the handset mismatch problem by training separate handset-dependent background models (speaker-independent, balanced gender). In this way, biases resulting from handset mismatches between the claimant and the normalizing impostor model are reduced. <p> This method was described as "random pooled" in <ref> [3] </ref>. In the log-domain, the ratio can be expressed as a difference of terms, fl (X j k) = L (X j k ) L (X j k ) (3) where k denotes the composite impostor model. <p> ICASSP-97 1 c fl IEEE 1997 here) are combined into one model. This contrasts with cohort methods, where separate speaker-dependent models are used. The composite models are simple to implement, and have been shown to perform comparably with cohort-based methods <ref> [3] </ref>. For the experiments reported in this paper, we used 1280 Gaussian mixtures for the composite model. 3. EXPERIMENTAL DATABASE The database we used in our experiments is the March 1996 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation. The database is a subset of Switchboard, a conversational-style corpus of long distance telephone calls. <p> Table 3 compares the H-Composite method to cohort-based methods. Cohort normalization uses one or more speaker-dependent impostor models as the background model. The methods include "Cohort" (one cohort), 10 closest cohorts, and 10 maximally spread closest (10-msc) cohorts <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. The total number of Gaussians used to normalize each target speaker for the H-Composite, Composite and the 10 closest and maximally spread cohorts is the same (1280 Gaussians) 1 . All of the methods yield significant improvement over the unnormalized scores (no background model).
