Abstract: The recognition of repetitive movements characteristic of walking people, galloping horses, or flying birds is a routine function of the human visual system. It has been demonstrated that humans can recognize such activity solely on the basis of motion information. We present a novel computational approach for detecting such activities in real image sequences on the basis of the periodic nature of their signatures. The approach suggests a low-level feature based activity recognition mechanism. This contrasts with earlier model-based approaches for recognizing such activities.

Reference-contexts: The results were quite sensitive to discrete errors and thus highly dependent on the ability to solve the correspondence problem and accurately track joint and limb positions. This severely limits the general applicability of the method. Anderson et al. <ref> [ Anderson et al., 1985 ] </ref> describe a method of change detection for surveillance applications based on the spectral energy in a temporal difference image. This was not generalized to other motion features or more sophisticated recognition.

Reference-contexts: A modest amount of this work addresses more complicated motion recognition issues [ Johansson, 1973, Cutting, 1981, Hoffman and Flinch buagh, 1982, Hildreth and Koch, 1987 ] , but the models and descriptions have typically not been implemented. Various computational models of temporal structure, have been proposed (e.g. <ref> [ Chun, 1986, Feldman, 1988 ] </ref> ) but much of this work is at a fairly high level of abstraction, and has not actually been applied to visual motion recognition except in rather artificial tests. Goddard [ Goddard, 1989 ] considers recognizing event sequences from Moving Light Display (MLD) images.

Reference-contexts: When people are shown these images they dismiss single frames as meaningless dot patterns, but they recognize the sequential presentation of them as walking, running or jumping etc. Subjects can also identify the actor's gender and even identify the actor if known to them <ref> [ Johansson, 1973 ] </ref> . Duplication of some of these motion recognition abilities in machine systems would be useful in a number of applications. One area is in automated surveil lance.

Reference-contexts: A challenging part in computing these invariants is to recover the connectivity of the individual dots (by body parts) in the MLD images.

This work emphasized rather high-level symbolic models of temporal sequences, an approach made possible by the discrete nature of the moving light displays.

The system required the location of the lips to be entered by hand, and depended on an explicitly constructed lip model.

Reference-contexts: Examples of motion events are isolated instances of opening a door, starting of a car, throwing a ball etc. It turns out that temporal textures can be effectively treated with statistical techniques analogous to those used in gray-level texture discrimination. A pre vious paper <ref> [ Polana and Nelson, 1992 ] </ref> describes this. Activities and motion events, on the other hand, are more discretely structured, and techniques similar to those used in static object recognition would be expected to be useful in their classification.
