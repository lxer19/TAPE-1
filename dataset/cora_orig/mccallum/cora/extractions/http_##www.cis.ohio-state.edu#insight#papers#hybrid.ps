Abstract: We describe a model semantics and a simulation algorithm for characterizing a class of dynamic physical systems operating in the so-called sliding regimes. Many continuous physical systems operate at multiple time scales. To simplify behavior generation, we often abstract away details at faster time scales or near discontinuous boundaries and describe the resulting system as a hybrid system with distinct modes. Mode transitions are induced by internal state changes or external control signals. It is common for such systems to exhibit chattering behaviors at the discontinuous transition boundaries which presents challenges to conventional numerical methods for analyzing system behaviors. We present an efficient, adaptive algorithm for simulating this class of systems, based on a careful analysis of the model semantics at the boundaries of discontinuity. Simulation results show that the algorithm is chatter free and more efficient than conventional integration methods for sliding-mode systems.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, a number of approaches with well defined execution semantics, such as Petri nets and finite state automata, have been applied to discrete system modeling <ref> (Aho, Hopcroft, & Ullman 1974) </ref>. Many numerical methods rely on the continuity assumptions in the dynamic system models. Near the discontinuous boundary, a wide variety of behaviors may occur.

Reference-contexts: These collisions can be modeled by Newton's law using a coefficient of restitution, *, to model loss of energy during collision v + rod v + cam = *(v rod v cam ). Typically, * is a function of impact velocities <ref> (Brach 1991) </ref>, and a threshold, * th , can be set below which the collision is considered perfectly non-elastic (i.e., * = 0).

Reference-contexts: This causes the aggregate behavior along the switching surface to progress very slowly and simulated time almost comes to a halt. This slow component of the dynamics along the sliding surface has to be approximated either by equivalence in control (Zhao & Utkin 1996) or equivalence in dynamics <ref> (Filippov 1960) </ref> so that a larger step size could be used by an integration scheme without introducing untolerable er rors. Chattering in Physical Systems In this section we study multi-mode behavior of two paradigmatic systems. The evaporator overflow mechanism exhibits chattering behavior in its hybrid system model.

Reference-contexts: Examples of Hybrid Systems As a typical example of hybrid systems, consider the evaporator vessel in Fig. 1 that is part of the secondary cooling system in a fast breeder nuclear reactor <ref> (Mosterman & Biswas 1997a) </ref>. In this system, a sodium pump maintains a sufficient flow of coolant in the loop. To keep the level of fluid in the evaporator vessel from going over a prespecified maximum, an overflow mechanism is activated to drain excessive fluid once this level is reached.

Reference-contexts: Phase space behavior is piecewise linear, shown on the right in Fig. 2, and switching occurs at L = L th which is called the switching surface. We refer to this form of model abstraction as a parameter abstraction <ref> (Mosterman & Biswas 1997b) </ref>. threshold in the left-hand phase space. Time scale abstraction does not abstract away physical parameters, but collapses time so that the effects of fast change appear to be instantaneous and discontinuous (Mosterman & Biswas 1997b). <p> We refer to this form of model abstraction as a parameter abstraction <ref> (Mosterman & Biswas 1997b) </ref>. threshold in the left-hand phase space. Time scale abstraction does not abstract away physical parameters, but collapses time so that the effects of fast change appear to be instantaneous and discontinuous (Mosterman & Biswas 1997b). An example of this is given by the bouncing ball in Fig. 3. In case of an elastic collision, the ball moves towards the switching surface x ball = 0 with negative velocity, v ball .

Examples of hybrid systems include traffic control systems, electric power circuits, and economic models. Numerical analysis of these systems is often hampered by the steep gradient near discontinuities.

Reference-contexts: We have developed an adaptive algorithm elsewhere that can accurately follow a sliding trajectory and generate control signals at discrete times by exploiting the equivalence in control signals <ref> (Zhao & Utkin 1996) </ref>. In contrast, the algorithm described in this paper exploits the equivalence in dynamics for sliding mode systems and presents an alternative method for adaptively following trajectories at discontinuous boundaries. <p> This causes the aggregate behavior along the switching surface to progress very slowly and simulated time almost comes to a halt. This slow component of the dynamics along the sliding surface has to be approximated either by equivalence in control <ref> (Zhao & Utkin 1996) </ref> or equivalence in dynamics (Filippov 1960) so that a larger step size could be used by an integration scheme without introducing untolerable er rors.

Reference-contexts: Many numerical methods rely on the continuity assumptions in the dynamic system models. Near the discontinuous boundary, a wide variety of behaviors may occur. Following the classification in <ref> (Zhao 1995) </ref>, Fig. 5 categorizes three types of behaviors in phase space according to the directions of vector-field normal components in modes ff and fi, f n ff and f n simulation may make a large error when a surface is crossed and a mode switch is detected.
