Reference-contexts: For example, the materials scientist Gordon (1976) put it rather pithily when he wrote that we have to take account of the pit of anti-knowledge from which materials science has had to extricate itself. Similarly, natural language understanding can cause confusion in learning some computer programming languages <ref> (Bonar & Soloway, 1985) </ref>. In many formal domains new concepts are often introduced and explained by the use of examples and students are expected to use them to solve further problems of the same type.

Reference-contexts: It takes some experience with the new domain to develop knowledge of the causal relations within it. They can be learned because we apply our general knowledge of causality to the new domain (Pazzani, 1991). Indeed, even infants are predisposed to seek causal explanations <ref> (Brown, 1989) </ref>. Such structural accounts of analogy demonstrate how syntactic constraints can operate to produce analogical transfer; however, semantic constraints also affect transfer and come about through similarities in the surface features. The objects in problems can vary in the degree to which they are alike.

Reference-contexts: Syntactic and semantic constraints When an example is being used as an analogy, the objects (the salient surface features) in one domain are assumed to be 'put in correspondence' with the objects in another to obtain the maximum structural match. According to <ref> (Gentner, 1983) </ref>, the mapping process is governed by the principle of systematicity. This principle holds that people prefer to map hierarchical systems of relations in which the higher-order relations constrain the lower-order ones.

On this definition, the order of an item indicates the depth of structure below it. Arguments with many layers of justifications will give rise to representation structures of higher order <ref> (Gentner, 1989, p. 208) </ref>. Mapping an explanatory structure allows one to make inferences in the new domain or problem, since the relations which apply in the source can be applied in the target.

Reference-contexts: A weaker view of analogical access involves being reminded of a plausibly relevant analogue through some kind of similarity. Usually these similarities will be superficial ones. Remindings can occur if those similarities are salient (Holyoak and Koh, 1987), or transparent that is, if they are similar kinds of things <ref> (Gentner & Toupin, 1986) </ref>. The salience depends on the solver being able to infer that particular surface features are likely to provide a link to some underlying causal relationship which holds in both the source and target.

Reference-contexts: Imitation, on the other hand, does not make these assumptions. It is a problem solving process which involves: 1. forming a representation of the target problem. Novices are unlikely to have a complete problem model <ref> (Holland et al. 1986) </ref> so this representation is likely to be impoverished in some way. <p> problem is used; that is, that people attempt to derive locally optimal solutions to problems, since computational limitations and limits to our knowledge prevent globally optimal solutions - it is not possible to have an ideal problem model containing all the elements necessary and sufficient to realize a solution plan <ref> (Holland et al., 1986) </ref>. Hence, the need for the various heuristics people use in problem solving such as means-end analysis, hill-climbing, and if-something-worked-once-try-it-again whether they know exactly how it worked or not. It is in this sense that imitation is a rational strategy for problem solving. 5.

Reference-contexts: In other words, they could not solve distant variants of the problem using the explanations they were given. One of the main reasons was that the the explanations still left the subjects with a large number of inferences to make <ref> (Robertson & Kahney, 1993) </ref>. The relation between example and test problems was examined by Novick & Holyoak (1991). Using algebra word problems they looked at the effects of giving subjects specific numerical mappings for transfer problems. <p> That is, some of the difficulty students show in transferring their learning from one context to another is very often due to the information they are given (or lack of it) rather than any failure on the part of the student <ref> (Robertson & Kahney, 1993) </ref>. The present author gave two groups of subjects two explanations of a distance-rate-time problem. In one condition (the specific condition) subjects were presented with a problem explanation from Reed et al. which was specific to that particular example.

Reference-contexts: The example-analogy view and Imitative Problem Solving Novice problem solvers in a new domain cannot always be expected to understand the principle or set of relations that underlie an example problem. Indeed, a lot of problem solving may have to take place before an underlying principle is understood <ref> (Newell & Simon, 1972) </ref>. Rather than applying a principle that has been cued by accessing a relevant example, novices are more likely to map the surface features of problems and imitate the sequences of actions that can be inferred from the example.

Reference-contexts: Second draft 10 2. Accessing a relevant example The second step in using an analogy (the further thinking that Glaser talks about) involves matching the current representation of a problem to some kind of specification for the representation of an earlier problem <ref> (Norman & Bobrow, 1979) </ref>. That is, elements of the current problem are used as a probe to access a previous one. Alternatively, a solver may be given a hint to use as an earlier analogue to help solve the current problem.

Reference-contexts: Transfer can also be induced when the underlying principle is explicitly taught <ref> (Perry, 1991) </ref> or when the subject is encouraged to explain the relation between the surface and structural features (Brown & Kane, 1988; Lewis, 1988).

Reference-contexts: In other words, they could not solve distant variants of the problem using the explanations they were given. One of the main reasons was that the the explanations still left the subjects with a large number of inferences to make <ref> (Robertson & Kahney, 1993) </ref>. The relation between example and test problems was examined by Novick & Holyoak (1991). Using algebra word problems they looked at the effects of giving subjects specific numerical mappings for transfer problems. <p> That is, some of the difficulty students show in transferring their learning from one context to another is very often due to the information they are given (or lack of it) rather than any failure on the part of the student <ref> (Robertson & Kahney, 1993) </ref>. The present author gave two groups of subjects two explanations of a distance-rate-time problem. In one condition (the specific condition) subjects were presented with a problem explanation from Reed et al. which was specific to that particular example.

Reference-contexts: That is the principle and example are bound together. Thus even if learners were given the principle or formula, they would use the details of the earlier problem in figuring out how to apply that principle to the current problem <ref> (Ross, 1987, p. 629) </ref>. This is the case with the subject in section 1.3. She was aware of the principle but needed the example to see how the principle was instantiated within it, and then used the details - the syntax - to apply the same principle to the target.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, if they do not have an adequate representation of the target then they will have difficulty seeing any relevant similarities to an earlier potential analogue. However, the first propositional representation derived from the textbase <ref> (Van Dijk & Kintsch, 1983) </ref> may provide a way of accessing and using an earlier problem, since it involves a representation of the targets surface features.

Reference-contexts: They are following a recipe without an understanding of why that recipe works <ref> (see also VanLehn, 1990) </ref>. The view that the role of superficial features is simply to access a previous problem has been challenged by Ross in a series of experiments. According to the example-analogy view: the principle is understood only in terms of the earlier example. <p> The literature on analogical transfer shows how rarely this happens. It takes time for students studying a subject for the first time to develop the teleological understanding that lies behind the procedures they often have to learn <ref> (VanLehn, 1990) </ref>. It has been shown that students have difficulty generating inferences in textbooks since expository texts do not support inferences in the way narrative texts do (Britton, Van Dusen, Glynn, & Hemphill, 1990; Britton, Van Dusen, Gulgoz, & Glynn, 1989; Haberlandt & Graesser, 1990; Millis, Morgan, & Graesser, 1990).
