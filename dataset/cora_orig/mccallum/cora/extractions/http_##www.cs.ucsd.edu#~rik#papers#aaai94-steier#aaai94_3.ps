Abstract: This paper describes experiments documenting significant variations in word usage patterns within social subgroups of AI researchers. As some phrases have very different collocational patterns than their constituent words, we look beyond occurrences of individual words, to consider word phrases. The mutual information statistic is used to measure the information content of phrases beyond that of their constituent words. Previous research has shown that some phrases are much more informative as word pairs outside topically defined subsets of a document corpus than within it. In this paper we show that individual universities provide an analogous, socially defined context in which locally-used phrases are "exported" into general AI vocabulary.

Reference-contexts: 1989)<ref> (Church & Hanks 1990) </ref>. As we are most interested in simple word compounds (such as social security), we use "bigrams" (sequential word pairs) to identify potentially interesting word co-occurrences. Church and Hanks have shown that compounds have a very fixed word order and that the average separation is one word (Church & Hanks 1990). We therefore restrict ourselves to a window of one when parsing for bigrams. Words have meanings derived from their use both independent of, and with respect to, use within a phrase.

Reference-contexts: D.A. Cruse has defined a "transparent" expression to be one whose meaning is derived directly from that of its constituent words; and "opaque" phrases as those whose semantics cannot be attributed to the simple composition of its constituent terms <ref> (Cruse 1986) </ref>. For example, whereas the meaning of red herring or red carpet is opaque, the meaning of red paint is much more transparent. Halliday has made similar distinctions between "simple," "compound" and "phrasal" lexical items (Halliday 1966).

Reference-contexts: The correlation between T W M and difference in MI (M I t M I c ) in the Labor Relations topic was -.62. This was found to be very typical across the other topics within the collection. This correlation has also been independently reported by Damerau <ref> (Damerau 1993) </ref>. The conclusion we draw from this phenomenon is that the more descriptive the constituents of a phrase are with respect to a specific topic, the more transparent that phrase is within the topic and the more opaque it is outside the topic.

Reference-contexts: For example, whereas the meaning of red herring or red carpet is opaque, the meaning of red paint is much more transparent. Halliday has made similar distinctions between "simple," "compound" and "phrasal" lexical items <ref> (Halliday 1966) </ref>. He writes that often a phrase can act very much like a lexical unit in and of itself, and that often a phrase can have very different collocational patterns than the sum of its parts.

Reference-contexts: From a practical IR perspective, these linguistic issues become the question of just when indexing word compounds offers advantages over simpler indexing of individual words. We follow other recent work that considers a minimalist notion of phrase, based on simple collocation <ref> (Maarek & Smadja 1989) </ref>(Fagan 1989)(Church & Hanks 1990). As we are most interested in simple word compounds (such as social security), we use "bigrams" (sequential word pairs) to identify potentially interesting word co-occurrences.

Reference-contexts: Next, each individual word within a topic area was given an index term weight based on a variant of the term frequency fi inverse document frequency weighting scheme devised by Salton and Buckley 4 <ref> (Salton & Buckley 1988) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Previous Research This paper is a continuation of earlier research where we looked beyond occurrences of individual words, to consider word pairs or phrases <ref> (Steier & Belew 1993) </ref>. The focus of this earlier research was to study how the informational content of phrases, beyond that of their constituent words, can change within topically restricted areas. The mutual information measure was used as the statistic best reflecting this value.
