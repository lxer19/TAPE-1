Reference-contexts: Clearly, Alchourron had not in mind the possibility of computational implementation. 2 Moreover, in his 1993 paper he rejected this approach in favor of one based on AGM <ref> [Alchourron 93] </ref>. But in his posthumous paper of 1996, the epistemological reasons that led to that rejection are no longer present (maybe because he realized the deep connection between both approaches) [Alchourron 96].

The rest of this paper will be devoted to showing that Alchourron's defeasible conditionals are a cumbersome way to handle defeasibility: these conditionals hide defeasibility's essential procedural aspects, and relegate them to a mere clerical task of explicitating the consequences of the choices made by an external agent.

Reference-contexts: He subsequently concluded that classical mathematical logic was not appropiate for formalizing this ampliative and non-deterministic kind of reasoning. His line of attack shows clearly in the characteristics of the AGM system of belief revision <ref> [AGM 85] </ref>. The language of mathematical logic was preserved and the only big departure from that tradition is the addition of a formalism to represent changes of a theory.

Reference-contexts: This aspect of defeasible reasoning makes it appropiate for representing ampliative inference where both computation and corrigibility can force revision. An outstanding example is legal reasoning with its open texture, which provides for robustness in both procedure and specification <ref> [Hart 61] </ref>. 4 Comparison between systems Alchourron's DF T and the defeasible reasoning system presented in the pre vious section differ in several aspects. One of the differences is that defeasible reasoning is not concerned with semantical versions of the procedures.

Reference-contexts: So in general the dream of implementing non-monotonic systems in terms of consequence operators was abandoned. Instead of that, the ensuing consensus is that what really matters is the justification of an assertion, and that this justification is a result of a partial computation <ref> [Loui 91] </ref> [Pollock 87]. Moreover, a justification can be defeated by another one, if the last one involved more computation. Several systems were proposed, in which sentences are only accepted after a comparisson among the justifications for and against it.

Reference-contexts: This example shows also that Alchourron's notion of defeasibility is more conservative than the most conservative logical formalisms of non-monotonic reasoning in Artificial Intelligence. Even Circumscription (see <ref> [McCarthy 86] </ref>), solves in itself (without relaying on an "external agent") the problem of defining the relevant frame for the problem.

Reference-contexts: What distinguishes this type of reasoning from logic is that it is fundamentally procedural: the warrant of sentences is not defined in terms of the consistency of the warranted sentences with a set of axioms, but in terms of the procedure followed to support them <ref> [Simari-Loui 92] </ref>, [Vreeswijk 97]. 1 The procedure of justification is called argumentation. The idea is that arguments or defeasible proofs are derived for and against a sentence. Arguments can be partially ordered in terms of their "conclusive strength".

Reference-contexts: Several systems were proposed, in which sentences are only accepted after a comparisson among the justifications for and against it. These different systems perform what is called defeasible reasoning (most recent examples can be found in <ref> [Vreeswijk 93] </ref>,[Verheij 96]). Alchourron devoted his last years to the analysis of the notion of defeasibility. His idea was to develop a formal system capturing the essentials of defeasibility. Following the tradition in non-standard logics he proposed a new connective for the implication, with new properties.
