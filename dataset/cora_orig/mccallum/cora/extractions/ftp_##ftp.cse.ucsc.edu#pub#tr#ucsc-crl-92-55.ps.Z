Abstract: Using a more complex analytical comparison, we found out that the ISO implementation will outper-form the TMS, and this difference will increase with the number of stacking and transmitting stations. Simulating the token ring network produces the same result. Because of very small differences between implementations and thus necessity to simplify very difficult analytical problem, in mathematical evaluation we considered one concrete situation on the ring, but only simulation could give us the right answer on the problem. Other question is, which result is most costly. Of course, computer simulation is a more expensive way to find a better implementation, on the other hand, it is often closer to reality. In this example the mathematical cost-effective evaluation shows differences between implementations, but by simulation we determine how high these differences are. Another problem occurs, when the simulation model only weakly corresponds to the real implementation. In this situation the simulation can fail because of behavior differences in the real implementation. From this perspective, simulation models closely tied to the implementation scheme, although more complex, can provide on advantage in pre-implementation simulation and simplified automatic system implementation [7]. Such simulations can select the best approach from different implementation proposals or evaluate the behavior of the system, when the implementation alternatives are dynamically changed based on actual network parameters. Similar media access control proposals are in [8], [9], [10].
