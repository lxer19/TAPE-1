Title: The Argonne Voyager Multimedia Server

Abstract: With the growing presence of multimedia-enabled systems, we will see an integration of collaborative computing concepts into future scientific and technical workplaces. Desktop teleconferencing is common today, while more complex teleconferencing technology that relies on the availability of multipoint-enabled tools is starting to become available on PCs. A critical problem when using these collaborative tools is archiving multistream, multipoint meetings and making the content available to others. Ideally, one would like the ability to capture, record, play back, index, annotate, and distribute multimedia stream data as easily as we currently handle text or still-image data. The Ar-gonne Voyager project is exploring and developing media server technology needed to provide such a flexible, virtual multipoint recording/playback capability. In this article we describe the motivating requirements, architecture, implementation, operation, performance, and related work.

Reference-contexts: The last of the three cited needs, global disk abstraction, deserves further discussion since we later discuss its contribution to the performance of the system as a whole. The Virtual Shared Disk (VSD) <ref> [1] </ref> facility allows the particpating disk drives to be accessed at the device driver level from any node in the parallel computer. If a VSD disk is accessed on the node where its disk resides, the request goes directly to the kernel on that node.

Reference-contexts: However, the MBone VCR is a locally controlled system and does not show an infrastructure designed for large-scale service.

The IMJ runs primarily on campus and distributes video on a schedule over three channels. Playback is initiated from a Web page; but once a session is started, it cannot be controlled from the Web page. Content is recorded off-line using the RTPdump utility and vic and vat.

Reference-contexts: Since Voyager development started, it has become clear that a generally available server for multistream real-time data could also be used to record and play back tracking and interaction data in virtual reality (VR) environments such as the CAVE <ref> [6] </ref>. While the current version of Voyager does not support recording and playback of entire virtual experiences, it does provide a much needed starting point for VR server research. 3 Previous Work Commercial requirements are driving the development of large-scale video-on-demand playback systems.

Reference-contexts: Perl's socket interface provides some support for these applications, but the socket code tends to be low level, messy, and nonportable. We therefore turned to the Nexus runtime system. 4.6 The Nexus Multithreaded Runtime System Nexus <ref> [7] </ref> has been a joint development project between Argonne National Laboratory and the USC Information Sciences Institute. The Aerospace Corporation is also a partner in Nexus development. Nexus provides the management and control mechanisms required by the Voyager system in implementing a distributed media server.

Reference-contexts: Voyager uses the IBM Tiger Shark multimedia filesystem, described earlier. 5.1 User Interface The user interface for the Voyager system is a forms-based Web page from which users select functions and sessions, launch clients, start sessions, etc. We use custom MIME types <ref> [8] </ref> (application/x-voyager, application/x-voyager-capture) with helper applications to invoke media clients.

Reference-contexts: A multimedia filesystem, on the other hand, is designed to support the demands of real-time storage and playback of continuous-time data streams. In the Voyager system we use the Tiger Shark filesys-tem technology from IBM Research <ref> [9] </ref>. Tiger Shark is an IBM multimedia file system for AIX systems designed specifically to meet the needs of media servers, including * prevention of resource overloading by the use of ad mission control and disk scheduling, * scalability through file striping, * global abstraction for disk devices.

Reference-contexts: Companies such as Oracle, IBM, and Sun are producing systems capable of delivering hundreds or thousands of channels of playback. These systems are optimized for playback and require that material be encoded off-line. A typical system, the IBM Interactive TV <ref> [10] </ref>, has been used in interactive TV trials for several years. It is designed to be scalable in its delivery of prerecorded MPEG streams. The IBM system uses the IBM multimedia filesystem and can run on IBM workstations or on the IBM SP2, where it could support thousands of viewers.

Reference-contexts: Members of the Audio Video Transport Working Group of the IETF created RTP payload formats for H.261 [18], motion JPEG [5] and MPEG <ref> [11] </ref>. An RTP media stream actually consists of two packet streams: an RTP stream that contains the media data, and an RTCP (RTP Control Protocol) stream containing information about the quality of service of the RTP stream, as well as information about the participants in the RTP session.

Reference-contexts: RTP-record and RTP-play are two simple command-line tools distributed as part of the RTP toolkit by Henning Schulzrine. These tools allow the user to record and play RTP streams. In <ref> [12] </ref>, Holfelder describes the MBone VCR, a system for recording and playing back video conferencing sessions from the MBone. The MBone VCR uses the classic MBone tools as clients and uses information in the RTP stream to synchronize recording and playback.

Reference-contexts: We also wanted to develop a system that would integrate with the emerging suite of freely available desktop media tools developed by the Network Research Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory <ref> [13] </ref>. Voyager is designed to be used with vic and vat and to be managed and operated via the Web. <p> In particular, we mention the vat audio tool and the vic video tool, both of which use an object-oriented application framework that overcomes the limitations of earlier systems by offering a conference coordination model, diverse video compression algorithms, and the Intra-H.261 compression scheme <ref> [13] </ref>. 4.3 Standard Protocols The development of vic coincided with and provided experience and feedback for the evolution of the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) described below. Members of the Audio Video Transport Working Group of the IETF created RTP payload formats for H.261 [18], motion JPEG [5] and MPEG [11].

Reference-contexts: We use custom MIME types [8] (application/x-voyager, application/x-voyager-capture) with helper applications to invoke media clients. Media clients can be any RTP media client; however, we use vic/vat and have used the Precept tools <ref> [14] </ref>. 5.2 Backend The interface between the forms-based Web interface and the rest of the Voyager system is a set of CGI scripts. These scripts parse the forms output, perform allocation of the distributed server resources, and distribute the requests to the core of the server.

We use the ACE <ref> [15, 16] </ref> C++ class library in the implementation of these daemons to provide a measure of portability and simplicity. We use the ACE network socket abstractions to hide the required details of low-level socket code.
