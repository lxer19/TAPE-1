Abstract: A novel low-complexity lossless scheme for continuous-tone images dubbed the PABLO codec (Pixel And Block adaptive LOw complexity coder) is introduced. It comprises a simple pixel-wise adaptive predictor and a block-adaptive coder based on the Golomb-Rice coding method. PABLO is an asymmetric algorithm requiring no coding dictionary and only a small amount of working memory on the encoder side. Due to the simplistic data structure for the compressed data, the decoder is even simpler lending itself to very fast implementations. Experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed scheme when compared against other state-of-the-art compression systems of considerably more complexity.

Reference-contexts: For each entropy value, this allows the encoder to choose the best codebook from the N 1 choices. When the data is Laplacian-distributed, the Rice coder has been shown to be equivalent to the multiple Huffman codebook approach <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, but it does not require a codebook. For differential predictive coding, the Laplacian assumption is usually a valid one. Encoding of a given symbol with a Rice code comprises two components: the fundamental sequence (FS) and the sample splitting.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, if we know x, then the prediction error can only be in the range [ x; 2 N 1 x], which requires N bits to code. We use the Rice-mapper in <ref> [3] </ref> to map the original Laplacian distributed integral error value to a non-negative integer following an approximate geometric distribution. <p> One method is to compare the cumulative sum of each block, P J i=1 "[i] + J , where J is the number of symbols in the block, with some decision boundaries derived from assuming k random LSB's <ref> [3] </ref>. Another method is to note that adjacent blocks are highly correlated, and thus it suffices to search within k 1, where k is the value of the previous block. 2 Rice-Coding Based Compression Schemes 2.1 Original Rice Algorithm The original Rice coder is a block-based algorithm [3]. <p> k random LSB's <ref> [3] </ref>. Another method is to note that adjacent blocks are highly correlated, and thus it suffices to search within k 1, where k is the value of the previous block. 2 Rice-Coding Based Compression Schemes 2.1 Original Rice Algorithm The original Rice coder is a block-based algorithm [3]. The size of the processing block is a one-dimensional 16x1 vector. A cumulative counter is updated for each k as described in Section 1.4. The best k is taken to be the one which yields the least number of compressed bits.

Reference-contexts: Table 1 provides a comparison of our schemes with other existing schemes against the USC image database. Column 1 shows the compression attained by FELICS <ref> [4] </ref> (with the maximum k parameter set to 6), which is a low-complexity context-based pixel-wise adaptive algorithm also based on the Rice code. The JPEG data shown corresponds to the independent lossless JPEG function employing the 2-point predictor no. 7 and arithmetic coding [5].

Reference-contexts: The JPEG data shown corresponds to the independent lossless JPEG function employing the 2-point predictor no. 7 and arithmetic coding <ref> [5] </ref>. The third column is the straightforward Rice algorithm with the parameter k estimated via exhaustive search and a processing block of size 8x8. The column MixEncode is the algorithm described in Section 2.2, and PABLO is the algorithm described in Section 2.3, both with 8 fi 8 blocks.

Reference-contexts: However, in the case of the mand image, it is slightly worse because there are quite a few blocks with optimal k = 6, a value that is not used in our schemes. Table 2 summarizes the performance of the introduced schemes and the LOCO-I algorithm as described in <ref> [6] </ref> against a number of images from the JPEG suite of standard test images. The LOCO-I scheme is a pixel-wise adaptive coder employing an adaptive predictor, context-based error modeling with special treatment of long pixel-runs and Rice coding. It is symmetric for both the encoder and the decoder.
