Abstract: We provide a framework for the study of learning in certain types of multi-agent systems (MAS), that divides an agent's knowledge about others into different "types". We use concepts from computational learning theory to calculate the relative sample complexities of learning the different types of knowledge, given either a supervised or a reinforcement learning algorithm. These results apply only for the learning of a fixed target function, which would probably not exist if the other agents are also learning. We then show how a changing target function affects the learning behaviors of the agents, and how to determine the advantages of having lower sample complexity. Our results can be used by a designer of a learning agent in a MAS to determine which knowledge he should put into the agent and which knowledge should be learned by the agent.

Reference-contexts: There are n agents, numbered f1 : : : ng = N . If we let (i; j) = "agent i can see the action taken by agent j", and (i; j) = "agent i and j both see the same world", then the notation in <ref> (Fagin et al. 1995) </ref> lets us express these ideas more succinctly in terms of common knowledge among the agents in N , using the two following statements: C N 8 i;j2N (i; j) and C N 8 i;j2N (i; j).

Reference-contexts: Our analysis also takes a first step into trying to elucidate some of the emergent phenomena we might expect in these types of MAS, e.g. the results predicted by Theorem 3 were previously observed in a MAS implementation by (Vidal & Durfee 1996), and are reminiscent of similar results in <ref> (Hubler & Pines 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It is clear that increased nested models require more computation, what is not so clear is how and when these deeper models will benefit the agent. Different research communities have run across the problem of agents learning in a society of learning agents. The work of <ref> (Shoham & Tennenholtz 1992) </ref> focuses on very simple but numerous agents and emphasizes their emergent behavior. The work on agent-based modeling (Hubler & Pines 1994; Ax-elrod 1996) of complex systems studies slightly more complex agents that are meant as stand-ins for real world agents (e.g. insects, communities, corporations, people).
