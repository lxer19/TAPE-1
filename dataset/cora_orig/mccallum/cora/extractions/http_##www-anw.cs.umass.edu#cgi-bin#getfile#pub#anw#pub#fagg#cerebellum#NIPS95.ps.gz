Abstract: We present a hypothesis about how the cerebellum could participate in regulating movement in the presence of significant feedback delays without resorting to a forward model of the motor plant. We show how a simplified cerebellar model can learn to control endpoint positioning of a nonlinear spring-mass system with realistic delays in both afferent and efferent pathways. The model's operation involves prediction, but instead of predicting sensory input, it directly regulates movement by reacting in an anticipatory fashion to input patterns that include delayed sensory feedback.

While some liberties have been taken with this representation, the delay distributions are within the range observed for the intermediate cerebellum of the monkey (Van Kan et al., 1993).

Reference-contexts: The PC's output determines the motor command through a simple transformation. The model includes an efferent and CF delays, both equal to 20msec (t 2 and t 3 , respectively, in Fig. 2). These delays are also within the physiological range for these pathways <ref> (Gellman et al., 1983) </ref>. How this model is related to the full APG model and its justification in terms of the anatomy and physiology of the cerebellum and premotor circuits are discussed extensively elsewhere (Berthier et al., 1993; Houk et al., 1995).

Also as in Marr and Albus, the PC unit is trained by a signal representing the activity of a climbing fiber (CF), whose response properties are described below.

Reference-contexts: To illustrate this, we use a nonlinear spring-mass model based on studies of human wrist movement <ref> (Wu et al., 1990) </ref>: mx + b _x 5 + k (x x eq ) = 0; (1) where x is the position (in meters) of an object of mass m (kg) attached to the spring, x eq is the resting, or equilibrium, position, b is a damping coefficient, and k <p> Setting m = 1, b = 4, and k = 60 produces trajectories that are qualitatively similar to those observed in human wrist movement <ref> (Wu et al., 1990) </ref>. This one-fifth power law viscosity gives the system the potential to produce fast movements that terminate with little or no oscillation.
