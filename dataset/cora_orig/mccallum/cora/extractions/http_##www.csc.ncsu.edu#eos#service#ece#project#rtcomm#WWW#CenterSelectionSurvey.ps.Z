Title: Shared Multicast Trees And The Center Selection Problem: A Survey  
Author: H.F. Salama D.S. Reeves Y. Viniotis 
Affiliation: ECE Department and CSC Department North Carolina State University  
Abstract: MC routing protocols currently being standardized, PIM and CBT, propose the use of shared center-based trees, but they do not specify how to select the centers of these trees. We survey previous work on the center selection problems in the fields of operations research and communication networks.

Reference-contexts: Hence the increasing importance of multicast (MC) communication protocols which are able to manage the network resources efficiently and to satisfy the QoS requirements of each individual application. Active research on MC communication involves among others: connection establishment <ref> [1] </ref>, routing [2, 3, 4], group addressing techniques [5, 6, 7], and error handling [8]. In the past, very few network applications involved multiple users and none of them had QoS requirements. In addition, the bandwidth requirements of most applications were very modest.

Another disadvantage is that the end-to-end delays along shared trees are longer than the corresponding delays when source-specific trees are used [16]. A shared tree does not have to have a center. However, designating a node to be the center of a shared tree facilitates several session management operations. <p> His approach consists of two stages. First, each node computes its criterion assuming that all necessary information is locally available. Then each node broadcasts its criterion value. The values are compared distributedly and a center is selected. In 1993, Wei and Estrin <ref> [2] </ref> compared source-specific shortest path MC trees to center-based MC trees using simulation. One center-based tree is compared to the corresponding source-specific trees. The authors assigned a link delay and a link cost to each link. Two groups of center-based trees are studied.

He investigated the problems of broadcasting and selective broadcasting (multicasting) with emphasis on broadcasting. The only link weight function he considered was link delay. Wall proposed different criteria to be optimized in a center-based tree, e.g., the average end-to-end delay or the maximum end-to-end delay.

Reference-contexts: The construction of the MC tree is simple in this case: the shortest path from each source to the center and then the minimum Steiner tree (or delay-constrained minimum Steiner tree) from the center to all group members. This scheme was proposed for a class of videoconferences 3 in <ref> [17] </ref>. The authors selected the node with the minimum sum of shortest paths costs to all participants in the videoconference to be the center. Thus the center did not have to be a group member.

Reference-contexts: If the graph is weighted, i.e., it is a network, then the length of a path is equal to the sum of the weights of the links on that path. The graph theoretic terms defined below are useful when addressing the center selection problem <ref> [18] </ref>. They apply to both undirected and directed graphs. The eccentricity of a node is the length of the shortest path to the node farthest away from that node. The center of a graph is the node with minimum eccentricity.

Reference-contexts: For weighted graphs shortest path algorithms can be used to achieve the same goal. 4 3.2 Operations Research Many variations of the center selection problem in networks have been investigated in operations research. Problems considering only one center and problems for selecting multiple centers were studied. Emergency facility location <ref> [19] </ref>, hazardous facility location [20], and defensive facility location to minimize competition [21] are just a few examples of the problems studied. There is an entire research area called Location Research [22]. Most location research problem define the weight of a link as the delay along that link.

Reference-contexts: Location research problems consider situations in which all services either originate from the center or terminate at the center. This means that the center (or media) is either the only source or the only destination 2 . An interesting version of the multiple center problem was presented in <ref> [23] </ref>: locate a minimum number of emergency facilities such that the maximum delay from the closest emergency facility to any node in the network is less than a given value. This is a minimax problem.

Reference-contexts: Their results also show that forcing the center of a MC session to be a member of the MC group does not affect either the delay or the cost of the center-based trees. Shukla et al. <ref> [24] </ref> proposed a protocol for constructing MC trees in asymmetrically loaded (directed) networks. Their proposal allows the use of either source-specific trees or center-based trees.

Reference-contexts: All winners are then paired together, and the next group of winners is computed, and so on until only one winning node remains. That node is selected to be the center of the shared MC tree. Thaler and Ravishankar <ref> [25] </ref> proposed two distributed center selection protocols, and two versions of each protocol. The two versions differ in the amount of information, about the MC session and the state of the network, each of them requires.
