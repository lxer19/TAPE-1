Abstract: This paper presents a reliability and availability evaluation of a large Network Based Education (NBE) system called NovaNET. NovaNET is a wide area NBE system which serves thousands of users on a daily basis. A successful NBE system is expected to provide appropriate Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees to its users. Among the most important extended QoS parameters are system reliability and availability. Ever since its inception NovaNET has been providing its users with daily reports on system reliability and availability during scheduled user hours of operation. We present results from a study of NovaNET using 9 years of operational reliability and failure data. The data are used to discuss practical bounds on reliability and availability of a viable and successful NBE system.

Reference-contexts: In particular, NBE applications require high system reliability, low data loss rates, and low end-to-end response delays or latencies [4]. Quality of Service (QoS) that a NBE system can sustain for the length of a user session is of utmost importance from an end-user perspective [2], <ref> [1] </ref> and [12]. For example, measurements on NovaNET, a wide area NBE system, indicate that, once a user starts one hour of work (e.g., a lesson), to maintain reasonable user satisfaction, the probability of getting through that hour without any problems should be above 0.95 [2]. <p> NovaNET was designed keeping in mind user expectations and system operational profiles <ref> [1] </ref>, [2]. This includes user expectations of what is today known as QoS and user perceived overall system reliability. NovaNET performance profile, including information on its reliability, is collected, processed and reported automatically and continuously. It is made available to all users on-line in real time. <p> Failure Correlation Behavior Avner <ref> [1] </ref> has found that indices reflecting the frequency and duration of NovaNET failures are negatively correlated with an instructor's perception of the quality of computer based education. <p> From Figure 6, it is also evident that after the first 12 months of operation, the system has consistently maintained failure rate less than 0:05 failures per month (indicated by the bold horizontal line in figure 6), which research by Avner <ref> [1] </ref> indicates is consistent with end-user expectations. It is important to note that although in this case we use system level outages to model end-user perceptions, the correlation between system level failures and user perceptions is a strong one [1]. <p> the bold horizontal line in figure 6), which research by Avner <ref> [1] </ref> indicates is consistent with end-user expectations. It is important to note that although in this case we use system level outages to model end-user perceptions, the correlation between system level failures and user perceptions is a strong one [1]. Therefore, since we classify failures as events where all users lost complete system functionality, it is reasonable to assume that a system failure reflects end-user perceptions accurately.

In April 1996, for example, the probability of a NovaNET clock hour having no problems at all was 0.98, and the scheduled user time was error-free 99.4% of the time. We expect that a good NBE environment would have reliability and other characteristics that at least match above figures. <p> NovaNET was designed keeping in mind user expectations and system operational profiles [1], <ref> [2] </ref>. This includes user expectations of what is today known as QoS and user perceived overall system reliability.

Reference-contexts: Reliability and Availability NovaNET is an example of a large computer-based system that undergoes constant repair and maintenance. It is our experience that reliability growth, if any, of such systems is best described by infinite failure category models [8], <ref> [3] </ref>, [17]. Because the NovaNET system is a highly integrated association of software and hardware components (including peripheral devices), an appropriate model would be an integrated hardware-software model of the type described, for example, by [9] and augmented to allow for operator-caused and other failure events. <p> Figure 10 shows the instantaneous and average unavailability of the NovaNET from 1988 to 1997. It also shows an approximation using the fitted failure rate values from the LPET model, average unavailability and an upper bound on the mean fitted model <ref> [3] </ref>. Again we see that the NovaNET unavailability has been kept below 0.05, in line with the user expectations. For details of availability calculations see [13] [3], [17]. Two measures which directly influence unavailability behavior in a system are its failure rate and its field repair rate. <p> shows an approximation using the fitted failure rate values from the LPET model, average unavailability and an upper bound on the mean fitted model <ref> [3] </ref>.

Figure 11 shows observed and smoothed failure and recovery rates for the NovaNET system.

Two measures which directly influence unavailability behavior in a system are its failure rate and its field repair rate. Figure 11 shows observed and smoothed failure and recovery rates for the NovaNET system. A discussion of smoothing options can be found in [3], [17]. We used symmetrical seven point smoothing for computing the functions which we use as indicators of the overall trends. <p> We also see that the smoothed recovery rate is approximately constant although there are considerable oscillations in the raw data. Again this is consistent with previous work <ref> [3] </ref>. It is interesting to note that the recovery rate is several orders of magnitude larger than the failure rate. Since the recovery rate is approximately constant, it would be expected that the system (un)availability would be governed primarily by the stochastic changes in the failure rate [10]. <p> Our results show that, in the case of NovaNET, the long-term system reliability growth can be described well using the LPET software reliability model and it's availability can be described equally well using steady state approximations <ref> [3] </ref>. We also found that the LPET model provides excellent long-term predictions for the reliability. We believe that the NovaNET experience can serve as a benchmark for definition of a lower bound on reliability and availability that modern network-based education systems must meet.

Reference-contexts: Users of modern NBE services expect not only high quality educational and training content, but also effective delivery and support for these materials. In particular, NBE applications require high system reliability, low data loss rates, and low end-to-end response delays or latencies <ref> [4] </ref>. Quality of Service (QoS) that a NBE system can sustain for the length of a user session is of utmost importance from an end-user perspective [2], [1] and [12]. <p> However, rather than develop an overly complex model we illustrate the issues using the Logarithmic Poisson Execution Time (LPET) model [8]. In <ref> [4] </ref>, we investigated NovaNET operational reliability and found that the system consistently met end-user relia bility objectives over the last 9 years. Figure 6 shows the observed failure rate for the NovaNET system for the past 9 years. <p> This is an important metric since it provides us with an estimate of the time users were without service per failure occurrence. For the NovaNET data, the mean downtime per failure per month is shown in Figure 9. While it varies between <ref> [0, 4] </ref> hours per failure, the mean downtime seems to be roughly constant (actual = :407) hours per failure throughout the observation period. Analysis of the NovaNET system shows that per failure downtime is about 24 minutes 6 .

Reference-contexts: Similarly, if a student wishes to rely on an NBE solution to do homework or study, there must be guarantees that the system will be available, and will operate correctly when the student's workflow requests such assistance. In <ref> [5] </ref> we discuss a predictive QoS modeling approach which is intended to monitor QoS at the application layer and provide advance warning of impending violations for users of NBE systems.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, since we classify failures as events where all users lost complete system functionality, it is reasonable to assume that a system failure reflects end-user perceptions accurately. In <ref> [6] </ref> we present further analysis of the LPET model fit and show that although a log-transformed model yields better residuals, it results in a very similar fit to the data.

Reference-contexts: The predominance of hardware and communication related events as compared to software events is not unexpected for the NovaNET system. A large part of the NovaNET system was originally implemented in hardware <ref> [7] </ref> and relies on extensive communication equipment (intermediate switches, network cards, leased vendor phone lines etc.,) for it's operation. NovaNET has been in operation for almost 30 years and the system is being continuously upgraded as its usage grows.

Reference-contexts: System Usage and Data Accurate system usage information plays a central role in defining and evaluating system reliability and availability <ref> [8] </ref>. NovaNET conforms to this model and automatically logs its daily load including information on central system usage, user terminal contact hours, port usage, usage hours at remote sites, usage of individual lessons, keystroke statistics (number of keystrokes per unit of time), etc. <p> Reliability and Availability NovaNET is an example of a large computer-based system that undergoes constant repair and maintenance.

Figure 6 shows the observed failure rate for the NovaNET system for the past 9 years. <p> The observations are based upon approximately 40; 000 cumulative scheduled uptime hours. The failure rate shows a decline over time typical of large computer systems [17]. The intensity function for the LPET model is given by <ref> [8] </ref>: 0 t + 1 where 0 is the initial failure intensity, is the failure-decay parameter and t is the execution time. More details can be found in [8]. Visual inspection of Figure 6 indicates that the model appears to fit the data well. <p> The intensity function for the LPET model is given by <ref> [8] </ref>: 0 t + 1 where 0 is the initial failure intensity, is the failure-decay parameter and t is the execution time.

Reference-contexts: In practice, however, only recent data may be an indicator of the present reliability experienced by the users. Thus, it is important to assign greater weight to recent events. An approach often used in software reliability modeling is that of data aging <ref> [15] </ref> in which recent data is given more weight than past reliability data through piecewise failure modeling. Figure 8 shows NovaNET failure data between 1993 and 1997 (54 months).
