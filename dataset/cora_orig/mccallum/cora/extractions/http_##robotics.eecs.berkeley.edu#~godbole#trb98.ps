Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION We have developed a framework to analyze crash avoidance systems (CAS) and have used this framework to systematically estimate the safety benefits of CAS. Safety benefits of collision avoidance systems has been a subject of considerable research <ref> [1] </ref> which has established the following aspects of CAS: conceptual descriptions [2]; designs and subsystem performance guidelines [3, 4, 5, 6]; crash types [2]; and crash mitigation benefit estimates [3, 4, 5]. <p> As expected, the tasks we associate with each layer determine the models and tools of the layer. The relationship between existing models, tools and HARTCAS is illustrated. HARTCAS is an extension of the benefit assessment methodology described in <ref> [1] </ref>. The ideas underlying HARTCAS are inspired by two sources, namely, the benefit estimation equations described in chapter 1 of [1], and the performance measure discussion in [12]. 2. THE HARTCAS FRAMEWORK The five layers of HARTCAS are shown in Figure 1. <p> The relationship between existing models, tools and HARTCAS is illustrated.

THE HARTCAS FRAMEWORK The five layers of HARTCAS are shown in Figure 1.

Benefit Layer. This is the top layer of the HARTCAS hierarchy. It is associated with the computation of benefits from equations, such as those in <ref> [1] </ref>, of the form where p i t wo ( ) is the probability that a crash of type t and of severity i occurs without deployment of the CAS s p i ts w , ( ) is the same assuming deployment of the system, and p s on represents <p> Let p i p i t ncr ( ) ( )= -1 . The measure p i ncr wo ( ) does not depend on the CAS; it should be computed by the kinematic layer. Examples of benefit layer computations are given in <ref> [1] </ref>. System Performance and User Acceptance Layer. <p> The piecewise constant restrictions allow for vehicle trajectories to be computed by solving algebraic equations. This facilitates large-scale computation. The system performance analyses performed for rear-end collisions in <ref> [1] </ref> and the analysis of different forward collision avoidance systems reported in [14] are examples of kinematic layer analyses.

It is expected that p ncr w is directly proportional to p d s s . Section 3 provides one example of an exact relationship. The user acceptance measure p s on should be related to p ncr w and the following four CAS performance measures. <p> Therefore, the FCWS has subsystems for sensing, an alarm or HMI, and warning; the latter accepts inputs from the sensing subsystem, performs computation, and triggers an alarm when necessary. The alarm may be haptic, kinesthetic, or auditory as discussed in <ref> [3] </ref>. The alarms are assumed to be obtrusive (e.g., high jerk deceleration if kinesthetic). This has the advantage of alerting the inattentive driver in a hazardous situation, and the disadvantage of being a possible nuisance to the attentive driver. <p> The alarms are assumed to be obtrusive (e.g., high jerk deceleration if kinesthetic).

Reference-contexts: The relationship between existing models, tools and HARTCAS is illustrated. HARTCAS is an extension of the benefit assessment methodology described in [1]. The ideas underlying HARTCAS are inspired by two sources, namely, the benefit estimation equations described in chapter 1 of [1], and the performance measure discussion in <ref> [12] </ref>. 2.

The measures are similar to those in <ref> [12] </ref> and are as follows: False Positive Probability (FPP). This is the probability that the sensors of the CAS detect threats where there are none. This measure is identical to the sensor false alarm probability as defined by TSD.

Reference-contexts: One possible classification of severity levels is suggested by the AIS scale <ref> [13] </ref>. The symbols p t wo w without the argument i denote the total crash probability for t. This equation is used to estimate benefits for a particular CAS s with respect to a particular t. p s on is the basic measure of user acceptance.

Reference-contexts: Most of the models at this level are probabilistic. Driver interaction models are almost always so. The primary motivation for keeping models simple is to be able to analyze the effect of probabilistic variations of multiple model parameters. From our past experience with these analyses <ref> [15] </ref>, we conjecture that the computational complexity is manageable if one adheres to the following modeling assumptions: (a) The state of a vehicle and its neighbors may be described by positions, velocities, and accelerations with up to six degrees of freedom. (b) Accelerations, whether generated by drivers or control systems, are <p> If the reaction range is greater than the stopping distance, then there is no crash. We construct a probability distribution of vehicle deceleration capability as described in <ref> [15, 19] </ref>. Maximum deceleration capabilities of the vehicle population are modeled by using data on the maximum deceleration on dry pavement of new light-duty passenger vehicles, matched to with the corresponding proportion of each type of vehicle on the highway derived from the North American production figures.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the driver-reaction time to a warning is a random variable denoted by T d w that is normally distributed with a mean of 1.1 s and variance of 0.305. For unalerted drivers we use data from <ref> [21] </ref>. A distribution of unalerted driver-reaction times for highway driving was obtained by fitting a lognormal distribution to reaction time data collected by Sivak as described in [21].

Reference-contexts: Therefore the difference is very small and the benefit is nearly zero. Somewhere in the middle the benefit is maximized. Further investigation is required to ascertain whether bellshaped curves are obtained in general. Such bellshaped curves are mentioned in <ref> [22] </ref>. As the rate of nuisance alarms increases, we expect the rate of system utilization to decrease. Studies with aircraft operation [23] show that as the nuisance alarm rate increases, cockpit personnel pay less attention to the alarm. We anticipate that drivers will show similar patterns.
