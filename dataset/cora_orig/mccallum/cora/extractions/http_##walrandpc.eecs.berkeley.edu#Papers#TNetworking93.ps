Abstract: We show the existence of effective bandwidths for multi-class Markov fluids and other types of sources that are used to model ATM traffic. More precisely, we show that when such sources share a buffer with deterministic service rate, a constraint on the tail of the buffer occupancy distribution is a linear constraint on the number of sources. That is, for a small loss probability one can assume that each source transmits at a fixed rate called its effective bandwidth. When traffic parameters are known, effective bandwidths can be calculated and may be used to obtain a circuit-switched style call acceptance and routing algorithm for ATM networks. The important feature of the effective bandwidth of a source is that it is a characteristic of that source and the acceptable loss probability only. Thus, the effective bandwidth of a source does not depend on the number of sources sharing the buffer nor on the model parameters of other types of sources sharing the buffer.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, in the notation of Section 2, fl = Rfl 1 , = Rfl m , and fl := R i i fl i where is the invariant of Q: Q = . By an argument using the backward equation and Perron Frobenius theory <ref> [3] </ref>, h (ffi) = R log (e ffifl Q) fl where fl = diag (fl 1 ; :::; fl m ), and (F ) is the spectral radius of the matrix F . h is differentiable (and analytic) as a consequence of per turbation theory of matrices (see [2], p. 190-191) <p> Thus H 0 is strictly increasing which implies that H is strictly convex as well. So, the hypothesis of Theorem 1 is satisfied, and the effective bandwidth of this source is ff (ffi) = h (ffi)=ffi. This source is a special case of an example 2.3 in <ref> [3] </ref> wherein the rates fl i are random. 3.2.1 Two-State Discrete-Time Markov Source Ex ample If the Markov chain considered is of the two state (m = 2) type, then by direct calculation, h (ffi) = R log 1 p where a (ffi) = Q 1;1 e ffifl 1 + Q

The effective bandwidth results in Section 2 (using the large deviations approach) are more general than those of [8] and our measure of congestion (equation (3)) allows us to handle a buffer with sources modeled in different ways (e.g., a buffer with two sources: one modeled as a Markov fluid and the other as a MMPP).

Reference-contexts: In Section 2, we established that h is convex. A simple consequence of Lemma 3.4 in <ref> [16] </ref> is that either h is affine or strictly convex. h (0) = 0 implies that the affine case is the constant rate source of Section 3.1. If h is strictly convex, by direct calculation starting from equation (5), we get that H 0 = h 01 .
