Reference-contexts: It is therefore still essentially a trial-and-error approach, albeit a much more reliable one than traditional debugging. An important and interesting alternative to formal verification is synthesis, in which a program is generated automatically from its specification. In <ref> [EC82] </ref>, Emerson and Clarke present a method of synthesizing concurrent programs from indexed Computation Tree Logic (CTL) specifications. Their approach employs a decision procedure which generates a finite-state model of the specification 1 .

Reference-contexts: In [MW84], Manna and Wolper present a method of synthesizing a system in which the processes do not share variables, but communicate by means of commands from the language of Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) <ref> [Ho85] </ref>. While this type of system is distributable, Manna and Wolper's method works from linear-time logic specifications, and is not applicable to a branching-time logic like CTL. <p> which the controller is based, and therefore satisfies the CTL specification of that model. 1.2 Loose coupling We now consider a more interesting interpretation of our synthesized system of processes, in which the transition labels are viewed as commands which are passed as messages along channels between processes, as in <ref> [Ho85] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: move from N 1 to T 1 via the transition labeled T 1 !, it is required to coordinate with the process controller, which must make a T 1 ? transition at the same time. (This requirement is analogous to that of complimentary actions in Milner's Calculus of Communicating Systems <ref> [Ml89] </ref>, so for any given X i we will refer to X i ? and X i ! as complements.) The fact that the client process has the initiative is reflected in the existence of a T 1 ? transition from every process controller state in which N 1 is true:

Reference-contexts: In short, it requires that the system of processes be tightly coupled, an arrangement which is not suitable to widely distributed applications. In <ref> [MW84] </ref>, Manna and Wolper present a method of synthesizing a system in which the processes do not share variables, but communicate by means of commands from the language of Hoare's Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) [Ho85].
