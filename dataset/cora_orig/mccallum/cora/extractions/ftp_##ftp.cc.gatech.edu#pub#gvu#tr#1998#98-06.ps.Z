Abstract: One of the first useful applications of virtual environments (VEs) was the architectural walkthrough, in which users view buildings or other structures in a natural, interactive manner. The obvious next step is to allow the user to create or modify designs while immersed in the virtual world, but such immersive design systems have not generally been successful, because of a lack of constraints, the inability to perform precise input, the difficulty of performing complex tasks while immersed, and the fact that designers generally have not been trained to design in all three dimensions, especially in the beginning stages of a project. We present an immersive design application, aimed at university-level architecture students, which addresses these issues. Users of the system are immersed within an existing zoo habitat, and can make modifications and enhancements to the exhibit, using a set of efficient and complementary interaction techniques for navigation, object manipulation, and system control. A usability study has shown that because the students are not creating a complete design, but rather making constrained modifications to an existing one, interesting and unique designs can be achieved in a short time. Immersive virtual environments (VEs) present a unique experience to the user. This experience is characterized by a three-dimensional (3D) display, interactive view specification using head-tracking, and an ego-referenced, or inside-out, point of view. These qualities make VEs extremely useful for the visualization of 3D spaces, since the user can be immersed within the space and view it as if he were actually there. Because of this, the architectural walkthrough became one of the earliest applications of VEs, and is still the canonical example of a VE system that has made an impact outside the research laboratory. In an architectural walkthrough, the user is placed within a 3D model of a building or other architectural design, and can move through the space to view it from any location and viewing angle. Because viewing is dynamic and interactive, this is a very effective way for users to understand the layout, scale, and aesthetic qualities of the architectural space. But what is the purpose of a walkthrough? If the building is already complete, an architectural walkthrough may allow people who cannot visit the actual location of the building to see what it looks like. More often, however, walkthroughs are used to evaluate or verify a design which is under consideration, or which is only partially complete. In most cases, then, the user will suggest modifications to the design as a result of what she saw in the walkthrough. With a standard walkthrough, the user must leave the virtual space, then changes to the design must be made using desktop computer-aided design (CAD) tools, and the new design must be saved in a format that is usable by the VE system. Finally, a new walkthrough can take place, which may spur another round of modifications. This leads us to a question: if the user, while immersed in the space, can propose changes that need to be made, why can she not effect those changes immediately, so that the results are immediately visible? This is precisely the idea of immersive design. Users of an immersive design application can not only interactively view the space, but can also make changes to the position, orientation, scale, shape, color, or texture of features within the design. Moreover, since the tools allow modification of existing objects, such
