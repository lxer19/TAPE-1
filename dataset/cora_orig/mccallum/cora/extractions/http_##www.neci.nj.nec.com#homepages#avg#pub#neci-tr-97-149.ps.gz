Abstract: We propose a self-organizing archival Intermemory. That is, a noncommercial subscriber-provided distributed information storage service built on the existing Internet. Given an assumption of continued growth in the memory's total size, a subscriber's participation for only a finite time can nevertheless ensure archival preservation of the subscriber's data. Information disperses through the network over time and memories become more difficult to erase as they age. The probability of losing an old memory given random node failures is vanishingly small and an adversary would have to corrupt hundreds of thousands of nodes to destroy a very old memory. This paper presents a framework for the design of an Intermem-ory, and considers certain aspects of the design in greater detail. In particular, the aspects of addressing, space efficiency, and redundant coding are discussed.

The topic of [8] is a discussion, in general terms, of several design issues and tradeoffs relating to the implementation of redundant distributed databases.

Reference-contexts: Since these algorithms are also efficient in practice, encoding and decoding complexity does not limit our choice of N . We remark that more complex coding schemes <ref> [2] </ref> might be considered that are asymptotically faster yet but require slightly more than N words to reconstruct the original. Also, the topic of reconstruction given some number of erroneous values has been considered in the literature.

Reference-contexts: It is worthwhile noting that Intermemory solves the preservation problem associated with the ephemeral nature of computer storage media. As new subscribers replace old ones, memories are automatically copied onto the latest medium. Anderson's work <ref> [3] </ref> parallels our own, but his emphasis is on the freedom-of-expression and individual rights rationale, and less on the specific technical and architectural issues involved. The problem of efficiently distributing a file within a distributed system having connectivity described by a given undirected graph is considered in [9].

It is addressed by an m-bit binary address, and each block consists of N words of w bits. <p> connected network is assumed such that the Inter-memory service on each participating processor can be contacted at some network address (NA) today an IP address and port number suffice. 3 in August of 1799 while strengthening a fort located on the west bank of the Rosetta arm of the Nile <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: These words may then be regarded as the coefficients of a polynomial of degree N 1 over F . Then the value assumed by this polynomial at any N distinct points suffice to uniquely identify it.

Reference-contexts: Encoding and decoding correspond to the polynomial evaluation and interpolation problems respectively. Using O (N log N ) FFT-based polynomial multiplication one may perform both evaluation <ref> [6] </ref> and interpolation in O (N log 2 N ) time. Since these algorithms are also efficient in practice, encoding and decoding complexity does not limit our choice of N .

Reference-contexts: Web-indexing approaches dispense with the second role and allow a user to view all the world has to offer. They fail, however, to deal with the first. Creating a record of everything on the Internet <ref> [7] </ref> represents, by contrast, an emphasis on the first role and eliminates entirely the second. Our concept of Intermemory combines the archival function with what amounts to a self-selecting publication process. It is worthwhile noting that Intermemory solves the preservation problem associated with the ephemeral nature of computer storage media.
