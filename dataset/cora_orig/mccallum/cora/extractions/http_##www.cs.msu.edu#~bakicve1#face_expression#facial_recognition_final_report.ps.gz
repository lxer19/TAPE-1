Title: Using Neural Networks to Recognize Facial Expressions  
Author: Vera Bakic and Karissa Miller 
Date: February 13, 1998  
Abstract: A feed forward artificial neural network has been trained to recognize four facial expressions. A wide variety of subjects has been used to train the network. The network has been tested using the previously unseen images of the known subject, the images of unknown subjects and using the images with eye-nose or mouth regions set to zero. The experimental results show that the network is able to learn to recognize the expressions using the information from the mouth region only, while the information from eyes-nose region only did not achieve good results. The weights of the network were analyzed in an attempt to find out what the network is learning and we could observe that the large positive and negative weights were concentrated around the mouth region. It has been shown that the network with minimal number of hidden units to encode the output units was able to learn the classification. However, if the number of hidden units was increased the learning process was greatly sped up and improved.

Reference-contexts: They point out that facial expression recognition is not a well studied or understood task from the human point of view. Research in this area is diverse and includes approaches to facial expression synthesis [4, 5, 9, 3], expression recognition through motion and other means <ref> [8, 13, 1] </ref>. Other approaches that relate to the investigation here include the use of neural networks in performing analysis of faces, most often for recognition [7, 6]. Focus on the analysis of face recognition and expression analysis has continued to increase in the 1990's.

Reference-contexts: These latter experiments were designed to see if the neural networks could determine the expressions using only part of the face instead of the entire face region. The cropped face region was divided into lower and upper regions using an eye and nose-finding routine developed by Bakic <ref> [2] </ref>. Table 2 describes the break down of the test and training data. We tested the trained neural network on faces it had seen before in other images as well as independent test sample from several candidates it had not seen before in order to test its ability to generalize.

Reference-contexts: One third of the images are used for testing, the other two-thirds for training. The face regions were sub-sampled to two distinct sizes: 32x32 pixels and 64x64 pixels. Based on studies by Samal <ref> [11] </ref>, 32x32 pixels are enough for human recognition. These experiments tested this resolution for machine recognition as well. Additionally, the grey levels in the images were scaled to the range of [0..1] 2 camera.

Reference-contexts: It is a subject which crosses the boundaries of many fields. Many approaches to the task of characterizing and identifying faces and facial expressions have been investigated. Samal and Iyengar provide a solid overview of work leading into the early 1990's <ref> [12] </ref> in both face recognition and facial expression recognition. They point out that facial expression recognition is not a well studied or understood task from the human point of view.
