Reference-contexts: ALT UseriOk (p) & SoundiAlarm appears in correctness conjectures as UseriOk (p) & LoginiAllowed & SoundiAlarm = SoundiAlarm ALT UseriOk (p) & SoundiAlarm &LoginiAllowed = LoginiAllowed The implementation of implied nochange statement generation for the ASLAN verification system is outlined in the next section and is described in detail in <ref> [Aue 85] </ref>. 3.1. When Does A State Variable Change? When trying to decide what NOCHANGE constructs to add problems arise with variables that take arguments.
