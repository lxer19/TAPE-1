Title: LOGICAL PROCESS SIZE IN PARALLEL SIMULATIONS

Abstract: Most existing synchronization protocols require that the simulation application be partitioned and mapped to logical processes to make it suitable for parallel execution. Assuming the simulation models some number of physical components, an important design question is how many components should be mapped to each logical process? This is a nontrivial question because logical process "size" affects the efficiency of the synchronization protocol, load balance, and approach for implementing shared state variables, as well as the efficiency of the event processing loop within the parallel simulator. This question is studied in the context of a Time Warp-based parallel simulator. Results of two experimental studies are described that compare the performance of parallel simulators using different logical process sizes. One study uses synthetic workloads; the other uses an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network. These results show that the choice of logical process size can have a significant effect on performance, and the optimal size depends on model size, the number of available processors, and detailed semantics of the model itself.

Reference-contexts: ATM is one method for accommodating diverse applications on an integrated network. This diversity among sources has a direct impact on the design of high-speed networks and their expected performance. Traditional traffic assumptions are not applicable at the ATM cell (i.e., 53 byte fixed size packet) level <ref> (Das et al. 1994) </ref>. Thus, the analytical approach to performance modeling is generally numerically intensive and often approximate. Further, the approximate analytical models require validation that is typically performed by simulations.

Reference-contexts: It is clear that the answer to this question depends on the simulation model and implementation details of the underlying simulation executive. 4 SYNTHETIC WORKLOAD To quantitatively evaluate how different factors affect performance, a synthetic workload program called PHOLD was used <ref> (Fujimoto 1990a) </ref>. The simulation model consists of a collection of entities, that send messages to each other. Each entity sends message to another entity after processing each event. The destination is selected from a uniform distribution. The time stamp increment is selected from an exponential distribution.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION It is well known that long execution times severely limit the effectiveness of discrete event simulation techniques in modeling moderate and large sized systems. One approach to reducing execution time is to use parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) techniques to execute the simulation model <ref> (Fujimoto 1990b, and Nicol and Fujimoto, 1994) </ref>. This is a particularly attractive approach when simulating large networks because such networks inherently contain large amounts of spatial concurrency.

Reference-contexts: This is a particularly attractive approach when simulating large networks because such networks inherently contain large amounts of spatial concurrency. Here, we are primarily concerned with optimistic synchronization algorithms such as Time Warp <ref> (Jefferson 1985) </ref> that utilize a rollback and recovery procedure to synchronize the computation. Traditional PDES approaches such as Time Warp define the simulation as a collection of logical processes (LPs) that execute concurrently, and communicate by exchanging timestamped events, or messages; these two terms are used synonymously here.

Reference-contexts: Turner and Xu (1992) report success in speeding up telephone switching network simulations using a variation of Time Warp. More recently, work at the University of Calgary is developing a parallel simulation toolkit for modeling telecommunication networks <ref> (Unger and Xiao 1994) </ref>. Not all report success, however. Phillips and Cuthbert (1991) report that their Transputer-based conservative simulations ran more slowly than a sequential simulator. Tallieu and Verboven (1991) also report disappointing performance in simulating an Ethernet.

Reference-contexts: This strategy for updating state is sometimes called "push" processing, in contrast to "pull" processing where LPs do not maintain local copies, but rather, state is explicitly requested by each LP via "query events" when needed <ref> (Wieland and Jefferson 1989) </ref>.
