Abstract: The advent of electronic documents and the consequent creation of digital libraries |vast repositories of electronic information| has a profound impact on how we produce, organize, store, retrieve and consume information. All of these activities have been dictated to the present by the technologies used to share information; A change in the underlying technology, namely, the move from paper to electronic documents, offers a unique opportunity to revolutionize how information is archived and disseminated. This paper will focus on a specific aspect of the opportunities opened up by electronic publishing on the NII |the ability to present information in multiple modalities and thereby free it from any single presentation medium. Electronic publishing is mediated by a computer, an agent capable of processing the information. As a consequence, the ideas expressed by an author need no longer be bound to any single "display" form; nor does it require human intervention to translate the information from one displayed form to another. Electronic information can be processed and displayed in a manner best suited to each individual's needs. Thus, the advent of electronic documents makes information available in more than its visual form |electronic information can now be display-independent.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, one of the most powerful aspects of (L A )T E X is its extensibility. It is possible for an author to define the few additional logical constructs needed by a particular document instance using the T E X macro facility, <ref> [Knu84, Knu86] </ref>. Macros permit the author to abstract away layout details when writing the document. To give an example, the command "kronecker is not present in (L A )T E X.

Reference-contexts: An author can extend (L A )T E X by defining "def"kronecker-"raisebox-1pt--":"otimes":- and then write $ A "kronecker B$ The definition for "kronecker has extended the markup language, and consequently, the logical structure that can be expressed. L A T E X <ref> [Lam86] </ref> is itself a good example of how T E X macros can be used to implement a language for encoding document structure. The presence of user-defined macros in documents presents both a challenge and an opportunity for a system like A S T E R.

Reference-contexts: For example, one may wish a view that gives only the table of contents of a paper. Or, for a document that presents an algorithm, one view could give the whole presentation and a second view could present only the overview of the algorithm. See <ref> [Lam93] </ref> for a discussion on the hierarchical presentation of 7 T E X does not provide this operator, and it will have to be defined as a macro. We describe how A S T E R is extended to handle such macros in Section 3. proofs.

Reference-contexts: Further, producing audio documents can be a laborious and time-consuming task |just ask organizations like Recordings For the Blind (RFB), who are engaged in producing such " talking books" 3 . A S T E R -Audio Documents A S T E R (Audio System For Technical Readings) <ref> [Ram94] </ref> is a computing system that audio formats electronic documents to produce audio documents. Audio formatting produces renderings that are attuned to an auditory display. <p> The system of rendering rules used in A S T E R and the language in which they are written (AFL |Audio Formatting Language) are described in detail in <ref> [Ram94] </ref>. In a sense, AFL is to audio formatting as Postscript is to visual formatting, although AFL is a much smaller language. Here, we show a small example of such a rendering rule for a user-defined macro. In the following, we use CLOS generic function read-aloud.
