Abstract: This paper describes and analyzes a distributed algorithm for assigning codes in a dynamic, multihop wireless radio network. The algorithm does not require any form of synchronization and is completely distributed. The algorithm can be used for both the transmitter oriented and receiver oriented code assignment. The algorithm is proven to be correct and its complexity is analyzed. The implementation of the code assignment algorithm as part of the medium access control (MAC) and routing protocols of a multihop packet-radio network is discussed.

Reference-contexts: This protocol fits in nicely with existing MAC and routing protocols designed for multihop packet-radio networks. At UCSC, we are implementing the proposed algorithm as part of the FAMA [8] and Wireless Internet Routing Protocol [12] which are used in the Wireless Internet Gateways <ref> [2] </ref>, [7].

Reference-contexts: It has d one-hop neighbors and d (d 1) two-hop neighbors. The node should not have a code in common with any of its two-hop neighbors. Thus, it is clear that we require d (d 1) + 1 codes. This is a sufficient condition to obtain valid code assignments <ref> [9] </ref>. The network can still operate with fewer than d (d 1) + 2, even though some two-hop neighbors will have the same codes. However, for the proof, we assume that d (d 1) + 2 codes exist.

Reference-contexts: In our model, all stations have a common signaling code on which they implement an RTS-CTS exchange similar to the 802.11 protocol <ref> [10] </ref>. The data transfer can be done on the receiver's code for ROCA or on the transmitter's code for TOCA. The advantage of some form of code assignment is that a node's one-hop neighbor can receive a data transmission at the same time as the node. Fig. 3.
