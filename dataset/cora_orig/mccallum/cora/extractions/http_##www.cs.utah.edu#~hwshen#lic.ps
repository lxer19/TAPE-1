Abstract: We present local and global techniques to visualize three-dimensional vector field data. Using the Line Integral Convolution (LIC) method to image the global vector field, our new algorithm allows the user to introduce colored "dye" into the vector field to highlight local flow features. A fast algorithm is proposed that quickly recomputes the dyed LIC images. In addition, we introduce volume rendering methods that can map the LIC texture on any contour surface and/or translucent region defined by additional scalar quantities, and can follow the advection of colored dye throughout the volume.

Reference-contexts: Max et al.[4] further utilized the spot noise method to visualize three-dimensional velocity fields near contour surfaces. Cabral and Leedom <ref> [5] </ref> presented a Line Integral Convolution (LIC) method, which uses a one-dimensional low pass filter to convolve a white noise texture based on the directional information of the vector field. <p> We conclude the paper by presenting results of applying the techniques on a variety of large-scale scientific data sets. 2 Background In this section, we give an overview of the LIC algorithm originally proposed by Cabral and Leedom <ref> [5] </ref>. Although the method can be applied to both two-and three-dimensional vector data, in this section we restrict our discussion to the two-dimensional case to illustrate the basic algorithm. <p> The low pass filter used in <ref> [5] </ref> is a Hanning ripple function, which has a period of 2. <p> This allows the user to generate motion blur and additional artistic effects, as demonstrated in <ref> [5] </ref>. The dye insertion method utilizes the LIC's natural "smear-ing" to simulate advection of dye within the flow field. We simulate the dye injection by assigning colors to isolated local regions in the input white noise texture. Cells whose streamlines pass through such regions receive color contributions from the dye. <p> We have found that the average number of direct flow-back neighbors for each cell in our experimental three-dimensional flows is approximately two or three. 3.3 Convolution Kernel The Hanning windowed filter used in <ref> [5] </ref> can not be easily adopted by our algorithm to create natural dye advection effect. This is because that the Han-ning ripple function is a periodic function with multiple peaks, and the Hanning window function attenuates the values of the incoming function values at two ends.

Reference-contexts: Although the method can be applied to both two-and three-dimensional vector data, in this section we restrict our discussion to the two-dimensional case to illustrate the basic algorithm. We omit the description of some recent improvements to the LIC algorithm subsequently proposed by Forssell and Cohen <ref> [6] </ref> and by Stalling and Hege [7]. However, we note that these newer methods can be easily adapted to our new algorithm. The LIC algorithm takes a vector field and a texture as inputs. The input texture is usually white noise data with the same resolution as the vector field.

Reference-contexts: The LIC texture, which serves as the secondary data, has its own color map but uses the transparency defined by the primary data. To render these two input data sets, we define a volume mixture, which is similar to what is used in <ref> [8] </ref>, to blend these two input data sets.
