Title: Simple sets are not btt-cuppable  
Author: Marcus Schaefer 
Note: (Lachlan [7]) An immune set is not m-cuppable. (Downey, Jockusch [2]) A hypersimple set is not wtt-cuppable. (Nies, Sorbi [8]) A 0 -hypersimple set is not e-cuppable.

Abstract: We extend Post's result that a simple set cannot be btt-complete by showing that in fact it cannot be btt-cuppable, i.e. if the join of a c.e. set and a simple set is btt-complete, then the non-simple set is btt-complete itself. The proof also yields that simple sets are not d-cuppable (i.e. not cuppable with regard to disjunctive reductions). Post showed that a simple set cannot be btt-complete. In a paper by Stephen Fenner and the author [3] this was generalized to non-c.e. sets by isolating the immunity property which is responsible for the incompleteness. Another approach to the btt-incompleteness of simple sets would have been through degrees. How incomplete are simple sets? Putting it dierently: can the join of a btt-incomplete degree with a simple degree be btt-complete? We will show that the answer is no. Detnition 1 A set A is called r-cuppable, if there is a c.e. set B such that ; 0 r A B and ; 0 6 r B, where r is a class of reductions (like m, 1, btt, c, d, tt, wtt, T, etc.) The following three results are known: Theorem 2 We will now show that an analogous statement is true for btt-reductions as well. Theorem 3 A simple set is not btt-cuppable. For the proof we need to have a closer look at some older results. fl Partially supported by NSF Grants CCR 92-53582
