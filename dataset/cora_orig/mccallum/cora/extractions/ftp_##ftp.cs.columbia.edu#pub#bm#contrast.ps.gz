Title: A Practical Approach to Calculating Luminance Contrast on a CRT  
Author: Blair MacIntyre and William B. Cowan 
Date: March 6, 1994  
Abstract: Luminance contrast is the basis of text legibility, and maintaining luminance contrast is essential for any colour selection algorithm. In principle, it can be calculated precisely on a sufficiently well calibrated display surface, but calibration is very expensive. Consequently, most current systems deal with contrast using heuristics. However, the usual CRT set-up puts the display surface into a state that is relatively predictable. Luminance values can be estimated based on this state, and these luminance values used to calculate contrast using the Michelson definition. This paper proposes a method for determining the contrast of coloured areas displayed on a CRT. It uses a contrast metric that is in wide use in visual psychophysics, and shows that the metric can be approximated reasonably without display measurement, as long as it is possible to assume that the CRT has been adjusted according to usual CRT set-up standards.

Reference-contexts: When we say calibration in this paper, we mean calibration done to an exact colorimetric or radiometric standard. This almost always depends on measurement of the display surface, an expensive and laborious process <ref> (Cowan, 1989) </ref>. <p> There are three distinct approximations to luminance that must be considered, corresponding to different assumptions about the model of the CRT and the viewer. First is the drive luminance (L d ), which is calculated as a weighted sum of the gamma-corrected RGB values <ref> (Cowan, 1989) </ref>, and is thus easy to control programmatically. It corresponds to a model which assumes a display surface that fits the set-up model exactly and ignores inter-pixel effects. Second is the emitted luminance (L e ), which is the luminance of light emitted from the display surface. <p> Finally, the contrast is set to the highest level that produces no blooming when the CRT is used at full input intensity. Blooming occurs when the electron guns supply too much energy to the display surface, resulting in wide, blurry pixels and desaturated colours <ref> (Cowan, 1989) </ref>. While the exact L e values can not be determined, the relative luminance values change very little under different lighting conditions, assuming the CRT is properly set up each time the lighting conditions change.

Reference-contexts: To accomplish this, first transform the colours into the CIE XYZ colour 8 space <ref> (Foley et al., 1990) </ref>. Next, use the Y coordinates of the XYZ triples as the L d values in Equation 2. Equations 1, 5, 6 and 8 can then be used to determine the contrast for the two colours.

Reference-contexts: Increasing the pixel bleed beyond this optimal level causes the area to become even smoother (though not perceptibly), but the display loses its sharpness <ref> (Klassen, 1989) </ref>. Choosing the minimal value of for which no further improvement is possible is the essence of the shrinking raster set-up condition, and it defines a specific value for .

Reference-contexts: The relative black luminance is the luminance of black relative to the luminance of white. The contrast was calculated using Equation 1. This paper is based on a practical metric for determining luminance contrast which was developed while exploring a general approach to automatic colour selection for window systems <ref> (MacIntyre, 1991) </ref>. <p> There is no desire to accurately calculate exact contrast values for specific pixels on the display. Systems such as <ref> (MacIntyre, 1991) </ref>, which generate colours automatically, must choose colours before they are used, so a contrast metric is required which provides a single number that estimates the performance of the whole screen. <p> The average pixel adjacency is the average number of background or foreground pixels which are immediate neighbours of a typical background or foreground pixel, respectively. The approaches suggested here are based on those developed in <ref> (MacIntyre, 1991) </ref> and produced acceptable results in that context. As discussed in the previous section, the more that is known about the context in which the colours will be used, the more accurate the estimate of average pixel adjacency that may be calculated. <p> This is accomplished by rearranging the equations and solving for either L 0 d bg d fg , as desired. In <ref> (MacIntyre, 1991) </ref>, a contrast of 30% was used as a legibility threshold. This number was arrived at by informal testing of a relatively small number of people, and represented a calculated contrast which allowed text to be read comfortably across a wide range of colours and fonts.

Reference-contexts: This equation is a good approximation to the vertical profile of a moving electron beam, but less so to the horizontal (ie. scanning direction) profile, which is affected by the performance of the video amplifiers <ref> (Mulligan and Stone, 1989) </ref>. The degree of interaction between adjacent horizontal pixels varies from CRT to CRT, and involves substantial non-linearities on some CRTs (Lyons and Farrell, 1989; Naiman and Makous, 1992).

Reference-contexts: Note that a fonts thickness is dependant on its bitmap representation, and is not intended here to encompass its typographic characteristics, such as its weight or spacing, which may also affect a fonts legibility (see <ref> (Rubinstein, 1988) </ref> for a discussion of digital typography). It should also be kept in mind that the effect discussed here is device-dependent.
