Abstract: We use a new "aura" framework to rewrite the nonlinear energy function of a homogeneous anisotropic Markov/Gibbs random field (MRF) as a linear sum of aura measures. The new formulation relates MRF's to co-occurrence matrices. It also provides a physical interpretation of MRF textures in terms of the mixing and separation of graylevel sets, and in terms of boundary maximization and minimization. Within this framework, we introduce the use of temperature for texture modeling and show how the parameters of the MRF can be interpreted as temperature annealing rates. In particular, we show evidence for a transition temperature, above which all patterns generated will be visually similar, and below which a pattern evolves down to its ground state. Finally, we describe briefly some new results which characterize the ground state patterns.

Reference-contexts: The most probable configuration for the image corresponds to the one which minimizes the Gibbs energy. Different distributions can be obtained by specifying the potentials in (1). The autobinomial model <ref> [1] </ref>, which was studied by Cross and Jain for texture modeling [2], is formed when the MRF has binomial conditional probabilities.

One iteration is counted when M N exchanges have been attempted. <p> However, even when the texture is in thermal equilibrium, it will be constantly changing until it reaches its T = 0 equilibrium state. The texture studies in the literature have stopped the synthesis process after ten to twenty iterations stating "convergence" has occurred. In those studies <ref> [2] </ref>, convergence was defined as either of the two following criteria being met: 1. The accepted number of exchanges in the Metropolis algorithm is small; 2. i = 0 i = 100 (a) (b) (c) MRF are shown.

Reference-contexts: Though its choice is ad hoc, its behavior is understood as a rate constant that is proportional to how slow the annealing progresses. In this paper, we consider the direct effects of temperature on the texture pattern. 2.2 Aura Measures and Co-occurrences In <ref> [6] </ref> we introduced the aura. The aura gives a precise mathematical meaning to the notion of how one set B is present in the neighborhood of some other set A. <p> The reformulation shown here is a straightforward generalization of the one given for the isotropic and anisotropic autobi-nomial MRF in <ref> [6] </ref>. Proposition 2 Let fS g ; g 2 flg be a partition of S where x s = g if s 2 S g . Let the symmetric neighborhood N be partitioned into K isotropic subneighbor-hoods.

Reference-contexts: matrix as the matrix A having element A = [a ij ] where a ij = m (i; j), the measure of graylevels i and j, then an aura matrix is a linear combination of co-occurrence matrices. 3 MRF's and Auras Because the aura can be formulated using morphological dilation <ref> [7] </ref> and because of the relationship between aura measures and co-occurrences, we are able to relate MRF's to both dilation and co-occurrences by reformulating the MRF using aura measures.

Reference-contexts: Under suitable technical assumptions the aura matrix will become tridiagonal in the positive bonding parameter case and anti-tridiagonal in the negative case <ref> [9] </ref>. The structure that appears in the aura matrix will also appear in the co-occurrence matrix; we believe that these are some of the first results relating MRF's to structure in co-occurrence matrices.

Reference-contexts: Instead, it seems important to study the non-minimum energy states, and perhaps, focus instead on the constraints that can be used to maintain the desired pattern. There is evidence that nature forms patterns in this way constraining physically the materials so that their minimum energy configuration is patterned <ref> [10] </ref>. 6 Conclusions We have used the new neighborhood-dependent notion of an aura measure to linearize the Gibbs energy. The aura measures allow the texture to be characterized using the physical analogy of mixing and separation.
