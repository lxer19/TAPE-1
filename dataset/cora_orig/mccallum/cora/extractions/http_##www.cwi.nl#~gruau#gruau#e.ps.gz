Abstract: Research in robotics programming is divided in two camps. The direct hand programmming approach uses an explicit model or a behavioral model ( subsumption architecture). The machine learning community uses neural network and/or genetic algorithm. We claim that hand programming and learning are complementary. The two approaches used together can be orders of magnitude more powerful than each approach taken separately. We propose a method to combine them both. It includes three concepts : syntactic constraints to restrict the search space, hand-made problem decomposition, hand given fitness. We use this method to solve a complex problem ( eight-legged locomotion). It needs 5000 less evaluations compared to when genetic algorithm are used alone.

Reference-contexts: Other researchers have tried to evolved ANNs for legged-locomotion, but they all give more information than we do : they use expert information about the architecture. In the work of Beer and Gallagher [2] the precise Beer architecture is given. This 6-legged architecture described by Beer in <ref> [1] </ref> has the shape of the number 8, in which all the sub-ANN controlling adjacent legs are connected, the controller of the legs that are symmetric between the two sides are also connected.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction 1.1 The motivation for Interactive Evolution ary Algorithm In <ref> [3] </ref> Dave Cliff, Inman Harvey and Phil Husband from the university of Sussex lay down a chart for the development of cognitive architectures, or control systems, for situated autonomous agent. <p> Our view is that EA should be used interactively in the process of ANN design, but not as a magic wand that will solve all the problems. In contrast with this point of view, Cliff Harvey and Husband seem to rely more on EAs. In <ref> [3] </ref> they use a direct coding of the ANN. They find ANN without particular regularities, although they acknowledge the fact that a coding which could generate repeated structure would be more appropriate. The advantage of the Sussex approach is that it is pure machine learning, without human intervention.

Reference-contexts: Many schemes have been proposed with partly the goal of modeling biological reality. Cellular encoding has been created with the sole purpose of computer problem solving, and its efficiency has been shown on a range of different problem, a review can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. We explain the basic version of Cellular Encoding in this section. Extensive litterature on cellular encoding can be found at Gruau's homepage or PhD thesis [5]. A cell has an input site and an output site and can be linked to other cells with directed and ordered links.

Reference-contexts: As a result, they once more have only four weights to genetically optimize. 2 Review of Cellular Encoding Cellular encoding is a language for local graph transformations that controls the division of cells which grow into an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) <ref> [5] </ref>. Other kind of developmental process have been proposed in the literature, a good review can be found in [8]. Many schemes have been proposed with partly the goal of modeling biological reality. <p> We explain the basic version of Cellular Encoding in this section. Extensive litterature on cellular encoding can be found at Gruau's homepage or PhD thesis <ref> [5] </ref>. A cell has an input site and an output site and can be linked to other cells with directed and ordered links. A cell or a link also possesses a list of internal registers that represent local memory.

Reference-contexts: We view Evolutionary Computation of ANN as a "desing amplifier" that can "ground" this symmetry format on the real world. This is may be another way to address the well known symbol grounding problem. 1.3 The challenge of this work In <ref> [6] </ref> we show that the EA could alone decompose the 6-legged locomotion problem into the sub-problem of generating a sub-ANN for controlling one leg and put together six copies of the sub-ANN. We needed however a powerful IPSC860 32 processors parallel machine, and over 1,000,000 evaluation.

Reference-contexts: Those tournaments are used to delete individuals or to select mates. We no longer wanted genetic diversity, but rather genetic convergence of the architecture, similar to tuning an already working solution. We got the idea to use genetic convergence from the SAGA paradigm of Inman Harvey <ref> [7] </ref>. We threw away the motionless individuals, and those who had not the right number of input/output units. As a results, to generate the first 32 individual in the initial population, we go over one hundred evalutations.

Reference-contexts: Crossover. Crossover is implemented such that two cellular codes that are syntactically correct produce an offspring that is also syntactically correct (i.e. that can be parsed by the BNF grammar). Crossover between two trees is the classic crossover used in Genetic Programming as advocated by Koza <ref> [9] </ref>, where two subtrees are exchanged. Crossover between two integers is disabled. Crossover between two lists, or two sets is implemented like crossover between bit strings, since the underlying arrangement of all these data structures is a string. Mutation.

In the work of Lewis, Fagg and Solidum <ref> [10] </ref> not only is the general architecture given but also the precise wiring of all the neurons. This work is the first historic work where the fitness was given interactively by hand, and they also used a decomposition into sub-problem by hand.
