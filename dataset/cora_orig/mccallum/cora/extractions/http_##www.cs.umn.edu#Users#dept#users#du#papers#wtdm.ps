Abstract: Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) has been shown to be one of the most promising ways to exploit the enormous bandwidth of a single mode optical fiber. Networks employing WDM are commonly based on optical passive star couplers. The major cost and limitations of such networks lie in the interface (both transmitters and receivers) providing optical-electronic conversion between stations and communication media. According to current technology, an interface based on fast tunable wavelength devices is still in an infant stage of development. On the contrary, fixed wavelength devices are much cheaper and already commercially available. When fixed wavelength devices are used, to reduce the number of transmitters and receivers in each station several stations may transmit and receive on the same wavelength. Therefore, Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) is employed for those stations accessing the same wavelength. The resulting networks may require taking a multi-hop path to deliver packets from one station to another (i.e., multi-hop WTDM networks). In this paper we study multi-hop WTDM networks when each station has only one fixed wavelength transmitter and one fixed wavelength receiver. We propose a graph model called the Receiving Graph model to represent these networks such that their inherent properties can be easily understood and alternative designs can be compared. Furthermore, based on this model we discussed several design principles for such networks and some theoretical performance limitations are presented.

Reference-contexts: One solution is to use Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM). The WDM scheme exploits the bandwidth available in an optical fiber by modulating different wavelengths of light in the electromagnetic spectrum to provide several channels of smaller bandwidth which match the speed of the electronic interfaces <ref> [5] </ref> [6][21]. User stations are tapped onto an optical fiber via optical transmitters and receivers. The transmission from one station to another is accomplished by tuning the receiver of the receiving station to the transmitter's wavelength of the sending station. <p> At the present time, most of the tunable devices are still expensive and in the infancy stage of development. Additionally, because the tuning range is inversely related to the tuning speed <ref> [5] </ref>, the number of wavelengths can be tuned far less than required (O (N )) in many systems. On the contrary, fixed wavelength transmitters and receivers are much cheaper and stable.

Swift, proposed in <ref> [11] </ref>, uses a WTDM protocol to logically implement a completely connected topology and an adaptive multihop routing algorithm is incorporated to improve the performance under light load. However, each station still requires one fast tunable transmitter and two fast tunable receivers.

LAMDANET [20] requires an array of N receivers at each station so all signals can be received simultaneously. <p> However, a larger network diameter implies a longer packet delay in a wide-area environment where the propagation delay between stations is much more significant than the packet transmission time and queuing delay incurred in each hop. Therefore, to minimize the delay, a 2-stage Shu*eNet is preferred. In <ref> [18] </ref> another WTDM network, called Bus- Mesh, was proposed. It requires the same hardware requirement for each station. The Bus-Mesh network guarantees the path length between any two stations is bounded by 2 and it is also demonstrated that Bus-Mesh outperforms the 2-stage Shu*eNet under certain conditions. <p> Possible solutions are also provided. In the final section, we draw some conclusions. 2 Basic Multi-hop WTDM Network In this section, we shall illustrate the basic WTDM network by describing the Bus-Mesh network proposed in <ref> [18] </ref>. This type of networks is based on a physical optical passive star as shown in Figure 1. Each station transmits (receives) via a fixed wavelength transmitter (receiver) which is tapped onto a passive star. <p> This is used in [9][1][24]. However, this method can not effectively capture the unique characteristics of the network, such as its broadcast characteristics, channel sharing capabilities, and the number of fixed wavelength transmitters and receivers. Another representation is proposed in Bus- Mesh <ref> [18] </ref>. For example, Figure 2 is one way to view the connected topology of a 12-station Bus-Mesh network. We shall illustrate another view in the next section. Wavelengths are logically represented by a set of "buses". Each station is represented by a node. <p> In this case, we should maintain the shortest H RG to minimize L l . Clearly, the shortest H RG can be obtained when we embed a completely connected virtual graph (i.e., W = ff + 1). Essentially, this corresponds Bus-Mesh proposed in <ref> [18] </ref>. In order to find the design choice which results in the minimum L l , as we did in the analysis of T hpt u , two ranges of W avl are examined, separately. For the range of 3 W avl N , 2 ff W 1.

Reference-contexts: This delay may become unacceptable in multihop optical networks since the traversal of several hops may be required before a packet reaches to its final destination <ref> [19] </ref>. 27 Furthermore, with a passive star network, each node is located at a different distance from the center of the star, so the propagation delay from each node to the star is different. <p> In order to properly operate WTDM media access protocol, a method of signal synchronization, which guarantees non-conflicting arrivals of several signals at the optical star, is needed. Nevertheless, when the network covers a wide area and involves thousands of nodes, such global synchronization is a formidable task <ref> [19] </ref>. Because of these reasons, we can take the Centralized Passive Star Switch Approach proposed in [19]. The architecture of a centralized passive star switch is shown in Figure 9. The transmitters and receivers are separated from nodes and placed within a switching center. <p> Nevertheless, when the network covers a wide area and involves thousands of nodes, such global synchronization is a formidable task <ref> [19] </ref>.

The use of regular connected topologies provides several advantages; including simple routing, predictable path length and enhanced maximum throughput. Despite that these WDM networks may avoid the limitations of tunable transmitters and receivers, there is no wavelength sharing between stations. <p> However, we believe that the design principles described in the previous subsection can still be applied to special types of regular graphs. In this subsection, we choose two well-known types of regular graph, m-ary n-cube and Shu*e- exchange (Shu*e-exchange has also been referred to as de Bruijn graph in <ref> [24] </ref>), as examples to demonstrate this. These two types of regular graph have several desirable features, such as simple routing, small diameter, and flexibility of expanding. The address i of a node in an m-ary n-cube can be represented by a radix-m n-digit number. <p> To find the shortest path is more complicate than that of m-ary n-cube, but still can be performed in O (n) ( see <ref> [24] </ref>). It can be proven that there is only one unique shortest path between any pair of nodes. In the worst case, two node addresses differ in n digits. Thus, diameter is also n.

Reference-contexts: In order to sense the status (including un-used or collision) of a slot, one extra fixed wavelength receiver tuned to the transmitter's wavelength is required in each node. Several dynamic bandwidth allocation Time-Division Multiplexed protocols based on a single broadcasting bus have been proposed <ref> [25] </ref> and they can be adopted in this type of WTDM networks directly.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Emerging high bandwidth applications, such as voice/video services, distributed data bases, and network supercomputing, are driving the use of single-mode optical fibers as the communication media for the future [2][3][4] <ref> [26] </ref>. However, due to speed limits of electronic network access interfaces, the accessible bandwidth is far less than the bandwidth available in a single mode fiber. One solution is to use Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM).
