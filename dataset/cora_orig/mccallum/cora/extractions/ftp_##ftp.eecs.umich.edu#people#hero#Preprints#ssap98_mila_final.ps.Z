Abstract: This work treats a problem arising in intelligent vehicles and highway systems (IVHS), specifically in automatic road following, collision avoidance, and maneuver control. A millimeter-wave radar is placed on the front of the vehicle and an image of the radar backscatter of the terrain is acquired in polar coordinates. This image contains both road and offroad scatter components which must be segmented from each other. The radar sensor acquires the scene in polar coordinates while constraints on the road edges are naturally formulated in the cartesian cartographic domain. One novelty of our approach is to apply the road constraints in polar coordinates which allows us to estimate the road edge parameters directly from recorded data. Onother novelty is to construct an estimator which minimizes a cost criterion which is largely insensitive to the off-road scatter components. Numerical results are given for real data (L band radar images of a Southeast Michi-gan roadway) which indicate the accuracy and robustness of our approach.

Reference-contexts: The left and right edges of the road, X l and X r respectively, are defined as functions of the vertical axis y. Following the example of <ref> [5, 2] </ref>, these are modeled using parabolic curves: X l (y) = ay 2 + by + c l and X r (y) = ay 2 + by + c r (1) where a; b and c l ; c r are the parameters that we shall seek.

Reference-contexts: In spite of its quadratic form, criterion J is multimodal with respect to parameters a; b; c r . Criterion G is multimodal as well. In a similar context, EM minimization of the relevant criteria has been proposed in <ref> [4] </ref>. However, our edge model depends on a very restricted number of parameters, while both criteria J and G concern only on a small parcel of the image: these two facts permit an optimization by ex haustive search. 5.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we present an algorithm which has the above properties. It is based on estimation of a pair of tightly coupled parabolic curves defined in the cartographic domain and which are transposed in the polar domain of the raw image acquisition. Unlike the method of <ref> [5] </ref>, which applies a loosely constrained hyperbolic road model in cartesian image coordinates, the method proposed here performs curve estimation directly in the polar domain. <p> The left and right edges of the road, X l and X r respectively, are defined as functions of the vertical axis y. Following the example of <ref> [5, 2] </ref>, these are modeled using parabolic curves: X l (y) = ay 2 + by + c l and X r (y) = ay 2 + by + c r (1) where a; b and c l ; c r are the parameters that we shall seek. <p> An issue is to transform data z into the (x; y) domain: such an approach has been used in <ref> [5] </ref> which has the advantage of simplifying calculations. The drawbacks are that interpolating data into the cartographic domain generates errors which can be amplified during the edge detection stage and makes it difficult to exploit the advantages of assumption (e). <p> Estimating its edges amounts to determine the optimal S (ba; b b; bc r ; b d). The left and right offroad regions are denoted by T L and T R . The likelihood function of the radar image can be described using a log-normal distribution <ref> [1, 5] </ref>: P (zjS) = C2fS;T L ;T R g (n;m)2C (log z n;m C ) 2 C z n;m 2 2 (11) where C and 2 C are the mean and the variance, respectively, of region C. This model supposes homogeneous side regions T L and T R .
