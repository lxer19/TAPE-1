Abstract: We introduce some cheaper and faster variants of the classical additive Schwarz precondi-tioner (AS) for general sparse linear systems and show, by numerical examples, that the new methods are superior to AS in terms of both iteration counts and CPU time, as well as the communication cost when implemented on distributed memory computers. This is especially true for harder problems such as indefinite complex linear systems and systems of convection-diffusion equations from three-dimensional compressible flows. Both sequential and parallel results are reported. 1. Introduction. In this paper, we introduce some modified overlapping additive Schwarz precondi-tioners for sparse linear systems. The original additive Schwarz method (AS) was introduced for solving

Reference-contexts: The original additive Schwarz method (AS) was introduced for solving symmetric positive definite elliptic finite element problems, and was later extended to many other nonsymmetric and non-elliptic systems; see, e.g., [7, 8, 16]. AS is available in several large parallel software libraries, such as PETSc <ref> [1] </ref> and P-SPARSLIB [14]. We here propose a very simple change, and the resulting algorithm is more effective in terms of both iteration numbers and CPU time on sequential and parallel computers. <p> We note that RAS is the default parallel preconditioner for nonsymmetric sparse linear systems in PETSc <ref> [1] </ref>, and has been used in several applications ([11, 13]). The paper is organized as follows. We devote x2 to the description of RAS and other variants. Several case studies are given in x3. We conclude the paper by a few remarks in x4. 2.

Reference-contexts: A restricted additive Schwarz preconditioner. We consider a linear system, Ax = b (1) where A = (a ij ) is an n fi n nonsingular sparse matrix having a non-zero pattern that is symmetric. To describe the algebraic Schwarz algorithm, as in <ref> [6] </ref>, we define a graph G = (W; E), where the set of vertices W = f1; ; ng represents the n unknowns and the edge set E = f (i; j) j a i;j 6= 0g represents the pairs of vertices that are coupled by a nonzero element in A. <p> If ffi = 0, M 1 RAS reduces to the usual block diagonal preconditioner. Remark 2.2. A multiplicative version of RAS can be derived easily as in <ref> [6] </ref>. Remark 2.3. In a parallel implementation, half of the communication cost can be saved because R 0 i x does not involve any data exchange with the neighboring processors. This is the main motivation for us to design this algorithm in replacing the AS method. Remark 2.4.

Details can be found in <ref> [7, 16] </ref>. Remark 2.7. Some improvement can be obtained if the restriction operator is defined by using certain weights such that the sum of the operators is equal to the identity matrix.
