Abstract: Workflow management systems facilitate the everyday operation of business processes by taking care of the logistic control of work. In contrast to traditional information systems, they attempt to support frequent changes of the workflows at hand. Therefore, the need for analysis methods to verify the correctness of workflows is becoming more prominent. In this paper we present a method based on Petri nets. This analysis method exploits the structure of the Petri net to find potential errors in the design of the workflow. Moreover, the analysis method allows for the compositional verification of workflows.

Reference-contexts: An AND-split corresponds to a transition with two or more output places, and an AND-join corresponds to a transition with two or more input places.

Moreover, in <ref> [2, 3] </ref> it is shown that the Petri net approach also allows for useful routing constructs absent in many WFMS's. A Petri net which models the process dimension of a workflow, is called a WorkFlow net (WF-net).

For the designer of such a workflow the complexity is overwhelming and communication with end-users using one huge diagram is difficult. In most cases hierarchical (de)composition is used to tackle 15 this problem.

Reference-contexts: Let PN be a well-structured WF-net. The extended net PN is elementary extended non-self controlling (Theorem 2) and structurally bounded (see proof of Lemma 5). For bounded elementary extended non-self controlling nets the problem of deciding whether a given marking is live, can be solved in polynomial time (See <ref> [4] </ref>). Therefore, the problem of deciding whether .PN ; i/ is live and bounded can be solved in polynomial time. By Theorem 1, this corresponds to soundness. fl 14 Lemma 6 A sound well-structured WF-net is safe. Proof. <p> By Theorem 1, this corresponds to soundness. fl 14 Lemma 6 A sound well-structured WF-net is safe. Proof. Let PN be the net PN extended with a transition connecting o and i. PN is extended non-self controlling. PN is covered by state-machines (S-components), see Corollary 5.3 in <ref> [4] </ref>. Hence, each place is part of such a state-machine component. Clearly, i and o are nodes of any state-machine component. Hence, for each place p there is a semi-positive invariant with weights 0 or 1 which assigns a positive weight to p, i and o.

Reference-contexts: However, there are a number of problems: * For a complex WF-net it may be intractable to decide soundness. (For arbitrary WF-nets liveness and boundedness are decidable but also EXPSPACE-hard, cf. Cheng, Esparza and Palsberg <ref> [6] </ref>.) * Soundness is a minimal requirement. Readability and maintainability issues are not addressed by Theorem 1. * Theorem 1 does not show how a non-sound WF-net should be modified, i.e., it does not identify constructs which invalidate the soundness property.

Reference-contexts: Lemma 5 A strongly connected well-handled Petri net is well-formed. Proof. Let PN be a strongly connected well-handled Petri net. Clearly, there are no circuits that have PT-handles nor TP-handles (<ref> [11] </ref>). Therefore, the net is structurally bounded (See Theorem 3.1 in [11]) and structurally live (See Theorem 3.2 in [11]). Hence, PN is well-formed. fl Clearly, well-handledness is a desirable property for any WF-net PN . Moreover, we also require the extended PN to be well-handled.

Reference-contexts: Since then the use and study of Petri nets has increased considerably. For a review of the history of Petri nets and an extensive bibliography the reader is referred to Murata <ref> [15] </ref>. The classical Petri net is a directed bipartite graph with two node types called places and transitions. The nodes are connected via directed arcs. Connections between two nodes of the same type are not allowed. Places are represented by circles and transitions by rectangles.

Reference-contexts: Since PN is not bounded there are two states M i and M j such that i fl fl ! M j and M j &gt; M i . (See for example the proof that the coverability tree is finite in Peterson <ref> [16] </ref> (Theorem 4.1).) However, since PN is sound we know that there is a firing sequence oe such that M i oe ! o. Therefore, there is a state M such that M j oe ! M and M &gt; o.

Reference-contexts: Figure 3 shows a free-choice WF-net. The WF-net shown in Figure 2 is not free-choice; archive and process complaint share an input place but the two corresponding input sets differ. We have evaluated many WFMS's and just one of these systems (COSA <ref> [18] </ref>) allows for a construction which is comparable to a non-free choice WF-net. Therefore, it makes sense to consider free-choice Petri nets. Clearly, parallelism, sequential routing, conditional routing and iteration can be modeled without violating the free-choice property. Another reason for restricting WF-nets to free-choice Petri nets is the following.

Perhaps surprisingly, the verification of the soundness property boils down to checking whether the extended Petri net is live and bounded! This means that we can use standard Petri-net-based analysis

Reference-contexts: The process dimension is the most prominent one, because the core of any workflow system is formed by the processes it supports. In the process dimension building blocks such as the AND-split, AND-join, OR-split and OR-join are used to model sequential, conditional, parallel and iterative routing (WFMC <ref> [20] </ref>). Clearly, a Petri net can be used to specify the routing of cases. Tasks are modeled by transitions and causal dependencies are modeled by places. 4 In fact, a place corresponds to a condition which can be used as pre- and/or post-conditions for tasks.
