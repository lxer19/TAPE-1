Abstract: We study some minimum-area hull problems that generalize the notion of convex hull to star-shaped and monotone hulls. Specifically, we consider the minimum-area star-shaped hull problem: Given an n-vertex simple polygon P , find a minimum-area, star-shaped polygon P fl containing P . This problem arises in lattice packings of translates of multiple, non-identical shapes in material layout problems (e.g., in clothing manufacture), and has been recently posed by Daniels and Milenkovic. We consider two versions of the problem: the restricted version, in which the vertices of P fl are constrained to be vertices of P , and the unrestricted version, in which the vertices of P fl can be anywhere in the plane. We prove that the restricted problem falls in the class of "3sum-hard" (sometimes called "n 2 -hard") problems, which are suspected to admit no solutions in o(n 2 ) time. Further, we give an O(n 2 ) time algorithm, improving the previous bound of O(n 5 ). We also show that the unrestricted problem can be solved in O(n 2 p(n)) time, where p(n) is the time needed to find the roots of two equations in two unknowns, each a polynomial of degree O(n). We also consider the case in which P fl is required to be monotone (i.e., the minimum-area monotone hull problem). We give a matching lower and upper bound of fi(n log n) time for computing P fl in the restricted version, and an upper bound of O(nq(n)) time in the unrestricted version, where q(n) is the time needed to find the roots of two polynomial equations in two unknowns with degrees 2 and O(n). fl An extended abstract of this paper was presented at the 4th European Symposium on Algorithms, Barcelona, Spain, September, 1996. y Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, SUNY Stony Brook, NY 11794-3600; estie@ams.sunysb.edu.

Motivation. <p> Gajentaan and Overmars <ref> [13] </ref> describe a large class of 3sum-hard problems that are suspected to admit no solutions in o (n 2 ) time. <p> Proof. We reduce the following to our problem: Given a set S of n lines in the plane, are there some three lines of S that pass through a common point? This problem, known as Point-on-3-lines, is known to be 3sum-hard <ref> [13] </ref>. We assume that the slopes and the y-intercepts of the lines in S are integers. We claim that this assumption does not affect the 3sum-hardness of the problem. Indeed, the hardness proof in [13] proceeds by showing that 3-Points-on-line is 3sum-hard, and that Point-on-3-lines is the exact dual of 3-Points-on-line. <p> that pass through a common point?

Although not explicitly stated, what is actually shown for the former is that the grid-point version of 3-Points-on-line, where the given points are grid points, is 3sum-hard.

Minkowski 2 sums of convex polygons can be found in linear time, but the convex hull is often not a very tight enclosure.
