Abstract: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems. (CSRD Technical Report 1349.) Abstract Current parallelizing compilers treat while loops and do loops with conditional exits as sequential constructs because their iteration space is unknown. Motivated by the fact that these types of loops arise frequently in practice, we have developed techniques that can be used to automatically transform them for parallel execution. We succeed in parallelizing loops involving linked lists traversals something that has not been done before. This is an important problem since linked list traversals arise frequently in loops with irregular access patterns, such as sparse matrix computations. The methods can even be applied to loops whose data dependence relations cannot be analyzed at compile-time. We outline a cost/performance analysis that can be used to decide when the methods should be applied. Since, as we show, the expected speedups are significant, our conclusion is that they should almost always be applied providing there is sufficient parallelism available in the original loop. We present experimental results on loops from the PERFECT Benchmarks and sparse matrix packages which substantiate our conclusion that these techniques can yield significant speedups. z A preliminary version of this paper will be presented at the Proceedings of 9th International Parallel Processing Symposium, April 1995, Santa Barbara, CA.

Reference-contexts: This iteration must be found so that any iterations that need to be undone can be identified. On computers, such as the Alliant <ref> [1] </ref>, in which iterations are issued in order, the test L [vpn] &gt; i is unnecessary. In order to terminate the parallel loop cleanly before all iterations have been executed, a QUIT operation similar to the one on Alliant computers [1] could be used. <p> On computers, such as the Alliant <ref> [1] </ref>, in which iterations are issued in order, the test L [vpn] &gt; i is unnecessary. In order to terminate the parallel loop cleanly before all iterations have been executed, a QUIT operation similar to the one on Alliant computers [1] could be used. Once a QUIT command is issued by an iteration, all iterations with loop counters less than that of the issuing iteration will be initiated and completed, but no iterations with larger loop counters will be begun. <p> the cost of creating these copies is not too great, this technique should maximize the potential gains attainable from parallel execution, while, at the same time, minimizing the costs. 9 Experimental Results In this section we present experimental results obtained on a modestly parallel machine with 8 processors (Alliant FX/80 <ref> [1] </ref>) using a Fortran implementation of our methods. It should be pointed out that our results scale with the number of processors and the data size and that they should be extrapolated for MPPs, the actual target of our methods.

Reference-contexts: In order to determine whether or not the execution order of the data accesses affects the semantics of the loop, the data dependence relations between the statements in the loop body must be analyzed <ref> [20, 14, 2, 28, 31] </ref>. There are three possible types of dependences between two statements that access the same memory location: flow (read after write), anti (write after read), and output (write after write). Flow dependences express a fundamental relationship about the data flow in the program.

Reference-contexts: In order to remove certain types of memory-related dependences a transformation called privatization can be applied to the loop. Privatization creates, for each processor cooperating on the execution of the loop, private copies of the program variables that give rise to anti or output dependences (see, e.g., <ref> [4, 17, 19, 25, 26] </ref>). For example, the anti dependences between statement s6 in iteration i 1 and statement s4 in iteration i + 1 in the loop shown in whether a variable may be privatized. Privatization Criterion.

Reference-contexts: These new parallel constructs could be called while--doall, while--doacross, and while--doany and could prove useful in the parallel programming (manual parallelization) of applications. The methods described here extend previous works <ref> [9, 30] </ref> in that they: 1. can handle remainder variant termination conditions, 2. can test at run-time for cross-iteration data dependences in the remainder, 3. do not require work and storage for saving the values computed in the recurrence, 4. support both static and dynamic scheduling, and 5. present a comprehensive <p> We present some experimental results in Section 9. In Section 10 we discuss related work. 2 Transforming While Loops for Parallel Execution While loops have often been treated by parallelizing compilers as an intrinsically sequential constructs because their iteration space is unknown <ref> [9] </ref>. A related case which is generally also handled sequentially by compilers is the do loop with a conditional exit. In this paper we propose techniques that can be used to execute such loops in parallel. <p> In fact, the author mentions that if the chunk sizes become too small, then the result might be an inefficient restructured version of the loop that contains too little parallelism to recover the expense [invested] <ref> [9] </ref>. We note that when the entire list resides in a single chunk (i.e., an array), then this method is equivalent to the method we describe in Section 3.2 for associative recurrences, i.e., loop distribution together with a parallel prefix computation to evaluate the dispatcher in parallel. <p> When the terminator is RI and it is known that there are no cross-iteration data dependences in the loop, they suggest using the naive form of loop distribution mentioned in Section 3.3 (also implicit in <ref> [9] </ref>), i.e., first a sequential while loop evaluates the dispatcher and stores its values in an array, and then the loop iterations are performed in parallel using this array. For the case of RV termination conditions no methods have been proposed in the past.
