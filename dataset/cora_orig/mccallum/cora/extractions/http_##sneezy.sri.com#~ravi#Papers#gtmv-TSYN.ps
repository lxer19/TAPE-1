Abstract: Ideal camouflage would be the concealment of an object by making it indistinguishable from the background. In real world situations, it is aimed at increasing the perceptual load on trained observers, by reducing the probability of preattentive detection and rendering detection systems ineffective with high search times and false alarm rates. For purposes of this task, faithful emulation of a texture shall mean that a reasonable person with normal vision, viewing the original texture and a computer-generated reproduction on a high-resolution screen would judge that they are both images of the same type material. This scientific study utilizes computational algorithms for synthesis of complex camouflage patterns. A detailed analysis of texture synthesis using the spin-exchange algorithm and extensive experimental results have been included. Finally, a multiresolution approach to texture synthesis has been presented to further enhance the perceptual quality of the synthesized texture field.

Reference-contexts: It is important to note that the cognition level does not utilize the raw sensory inputs but analyzes the perceptual cues extracted by the preattentive stage. Ideal camouflage would be the concealment of an object by making it indistinguishable from the background <ref> [1] </ref>. In real world situations, it is aimed at increasing the perceptual load on trained observers, by reducing the probability of preattentive detection and rendering detection systems ineffective with high search times and false alarm rates.

Reference-contexts: Visual perception research has shown that the important cues used by humans to perceive objects and discriminate them from the background include contrast, local discontinuities, color, texture, motion, depth and shape <ref> [2] </ref>. Most natural images are rich in textural details, i.e. the important perceptual properties are based upon the spatial arrangements of regular and repetitive patterns. Textural models are recognized to form the basis of preattentive vision [3].

Reference-contexts: Most natural images are rich in textural details, i.e. the important perceptual properties are based upon the spatial arrangements of regular and repetitive patterns. Textural models are recognized to form the basis of preattentive vision <ref> [3] </ref>. A need thus exists to develop capabilities to synthesize camouflage patterns and textures easily, to facilitate the reproduction of sample textures. fl This research is supported in part by the research grant (No. DAAK70-93-C-0037) from the U.S.

Reference-contexts: In the second approach, which we will identify as "Quantitative Perceptual Cue-based" approach, the emphasis is on the quantitative characterization of a set of perceptual or physical properties. Examples of this include approaches where thermal radiation models associated with the targets and backgrounds are utilized in image generation <ref> [4] </ref>. For obvious reasons, this approach is the one which is used by developers and user of new automatic target recognition systems. One of the main limitation of these modeling or synthesis algorithms is the inability to use the quantitative characterization of texture.

Reference-contexts: Reiterating the fact that texture is a region property, it has to be calculated over subregions of the image, and individual points cannot be assigned texture memberships. The texture model developed is inspired by the paper by Gaglowicz and Ma <ref> [13] </ref>, on texture synthesis and consists of a set of GLC matrices. It has been shown that such a model is capable of regenerating the texture it represents.

In this method, note that the lowest level in the pyramid is the original reference image while the topmost level in the pyramid is a low resolution representation of the reference image.
