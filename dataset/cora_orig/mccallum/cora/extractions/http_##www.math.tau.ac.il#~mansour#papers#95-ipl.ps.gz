Title: "-discrepancy sets and their applications for interpolation of sparse polynomials  
Author: Noga Alon Yishay Mansour 
Date: January 17, 1995  
Abstract: We present a simple explicit construction of a probability distribution supported on (p 1) 2 vectors in Z n p , where p n=" is a prime, for which the absolute value of each nontrivial Fourier coefficients is bounded by ". This construction is used to derandomize the algorithm of [Man92] that interpolates a sparse polynomial in polynomial time in the bit complexity model.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to check that the discussion in Section 2 implies that the modified set is a 2"-discrepancy set in Z n p . By Proposition 7' in <ref> [AR94] </ref>, for * &gt; p n=2 the size of any * discrepancy set for Z n p is at least ( n log p * 2 log (n log p=* 2 ) ) showing that the last construction is not far from the optimum. 3.3 Axis Parallel boxes The sets A <p> For the interpolation problem we need that p is larger than the degree of the polynomial in each variable. Therefore, the modified set can be useful here. It is not difficult to check (see Proposition 6' in <ref> [AR94] </ref>) that a random set of fi ( n " 2 log p) vectors from Z n p would almost surely be an " discrepancy set, and as mentioned above this is nearly best possible.

Since we have an upper bound, say t, on the number of non-zero coefficients, there would be at most t terms to consider.
