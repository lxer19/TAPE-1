Abstract: It is widely accepted that to extend the effectiveness of information disclosure beyond the limitations of current empirically-based retrieval systems, some notion of document semantics has to be incorporated into the retrieval mechanism. A recent approach to bringing semantics into play is to found the retrieval mechanism on the notion of logical inference. In this paper, we build on this approach and describe a promising new mechanism for information disclosure, called the Refinement Machine. The Refinement Machine features the language of index expressions as a language for characterizing information objects and a deduction mechanism driven by rules of inference. Two types of inference rule are distinguished. The rules of strict inference follow the line of traditional logical deduction. As the characterizations of objects are incomplete and requests are typically partial descriptions of the information need, the rules of strict inference are supplemented with a rule of plausible inference. This rule of plausible inference is motivated by recent work in the area of plausible reasoning in knowledge-based systems and, in particular, is derived from the work on belief networks. Besides giving details of the Refinement Machine, this paper also presents some preliminary experimental results.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we do not discuss this issue in further detail; we assume that a core set of index expressions has been identified. As to deriving the tree structure of a given index expression, we confine ourselves to summarizing the main algorithm from <ref> [BBB91] </ref>. After the removal of stop words from a title the remaining tokens are successively processed in building a representation of the corresponding index expression. In the case of a connector token, its priority is used to decide whether the current tree is to be deepened, or broadened.

Reference-contexts: Some, however, believe that the limits of exploitation of empirically-based systems have been reached, [Rij86a]. Quite a considerable amount of recent research in document retrieval has therefore been directed at incorporating document semantics to arrive at more effective retrieval, see for example [SvR90], [Wea88], <ref> [BC89] </ref>. In this section we confine ourselves to a brief discussion of a logic-based approach to information disclosure only as it forms the basis of our disclosure system.

Reference-contexts: Our experiences with index expressions thus far, have shown that a polynomial size of the power index expression is more common. For the proofs of the bounds mentioned above and a discussion of other useful properties of index expressions, the reader is referred to <ref> [Bru93] </ref>. Thus far we have looked at the power index expression of a single index expression only. For a set of objects, however, a core set of index expressions is generated each of which gives rise to a power index expression. These power index expressions may have some nontrivial overlap. <p> The underlying idea of this approach is the observation that some connectors bind terms more strongly than others; those that bind stronger lead to deepening in the structure. For more details the reader is referred to <ref> [Bru93] </ref>. <p> For a full report on connector probabilities, the reader is referred to <ref> [Bru93] </ref>. Note that using these connector probabilities provides only rough estimates of the probabilities required. Up to this point, we have considered variables that represent terms or binary index expressions and have defined associated conditional probability assessment functions for these variables.

Another area of interest is using the Refinement Machine to support interlayer navigation within stratified hypermedia <ref> [BW92] </ref>. We hope to communicate our further research results in future publications.

Reference-contexts: The motivation behind this is that much of the content of an information object is embodied in term relationships <ref> [Far80] </ref>. A parallel can be drawn here with the conceptual model from the database world where relationship types between entities play an important role; the characterization of an object consisting simply of keywords would be like an entity relationship model without relationship types.

Reference-contexts: Let ISA T fi T . If i ISA j, then j can be inferred from i, or: i ISA j ) i ` MG j This rule of inference is called modus generans and is denoted by MG. The ISA-relation is quite common in frame-based knowledge-representation languages <ref> [LG91] </ref>. Note that it brings domain knowledge into play within the Refinement Machine. Unfortunately, the ISA-relation cannot typically be derived automatically. We observe that care must be exercised when using modus generans due to homonyms. <p> In this section, we present a new approach to plausible inference based on so-called belief networks. These have emerged from research into the representation and manipulation of uncertain information in knowledge-based systems; for an overview of this research area, we refer the reader to <ref> [LG91] </ref>. The present section is organized as follows. In Section 6.1 a brief introduction is given to belief networks as a general formalism for probability-based plausible reasoning. Section 6.2 features how to build a belief network from a lithoid of index expressions.

Reference-contexts: Another set of elegant algorithms based on the statistical theory of Markov random fields, has been proposed by S.L. Lauritzen and D.J. Spiegelhalter <ref> [LS88] </ref>. Although all algorithms proposed for evidence propagation are based on probability theory, they differ considerably with respect to the algorithms employed and their complexity. It should be noted that in general probabilistic inference in belief networks without any restrictions is NP-hard [Coo90].

Reference-contexts: It is important to note that either the characterization of the object must be extended with new axioms, or some axiom (s) of the description have to be strengthened; an inverse approach to description strengthening is query weakening <ref> [Nie86] </ref>. It is easy to see that by strengthening axioms, the deduction process becomes less certain because it involves suppositions that were not originally a part of the semantics of the object. The Sections 4 and 6 feature a concretization of the Information Disclosure Machine, the so-called Refinement Machine.

Reference-contexts: Further details may be found in <ref> [Pea88] </ref>. The following theorem now states that the initial assessment functions of a belief network provide all information necessary for uniquely defining a joint probability distribution on the variables discerned that respects the independency relationships portrayed by the graphical part of the network. <p> In the literature therefore, several less naive algorithms for computing probabilities of interest from a belief network and for processing evidence in the network have been proposed. The most well-known is the set of algorithms presented by J. Pearl <ref> [Pea88] </ref>. The basic idea of these algorithms is that the topology of the graph of a belief network is exploited as a computational architecture.

Van Rijsbergen has recently developed a new information disclosure system in which the matching between a request and an object characterization is founded on the notion of logical inference. <p> The plausible inference mechanism of a Disclosure Machine can be founded on the principle of minimal axiomatic extension which has its roots in the so-called logical uncertainty principle documented in <ref> [Rij86b] </ref>. The principle of minimal axiomatic extension states that the probability of an object being relevant to a request is inversely proportional to the minimal extension of the object description allowing to prove the request.

Van Rijsbergen has recently developed a new information disclosure system in which the matching between a request and an object characterization is founded on the notion of logical inference. This contrasts with state-of-the-art disclosure systems, where the matching process is driven by empirical relations between query terms and documents.

Reference-contexts: However, it is highly unlikely that the object actually deals with this subject. Recently, attempts have been made at restricting conditions under which substitution can take place so as to prevent the occurrence of wild substitutions. A. Rosing <ref> [Ros91] </ref>, for example, proposes that a term should only be substituted by one of its generalizations: i ISA j ) k ` MS k i Another approach is to allow substitutions to take place only within the context of a so-called term sequence: a term sequence is a sequence of expressions <p> The question remains as to how the function value w can be obtained. One method is to analyze the frequencies of occurrence of connectors in binary index expressions. Recently such an analysis has been carried out <ref> [Ros91] </ref>. Index expressions were derived from the titles of the Cranfield document collection. Using these expressions, a lithoid was constructed as described in Section 3. An analysis of the index expressions in the resulting lithoid revealed that approximately fifteen percent of binary expressions involve the of connector.

Reference-contexts: The most elementary form of descriptor is a keyword, or term. Term descriptors have the advantage that there are a number of straightforward indexing methods to automatically derive them from information objects <ref> [Sal89] </ref>; the disadvantage of terms is that they sometimes lack discriminatory power as is particularly true in large object bases. An extension to term descriptors is the term phrase descriptor, or term phrase for short. <p> Term phrase descriptors have an increased specificity and thus an enhanced ability for discrimination. For example, the term phrase computer programming is more specific and thus more discriminating than each of the terms computer and programming separately. Even though straightforward indexing methods exist for generating term phrases <ref> [Sal89] </ref>, these methods often suffer from the problem that either too many non-meaningful phrases are generated, or conversely a large percentage of the phrases are meaningful but the resulting object characterizations lack completeness. 3.2 Index Expression Descriptors An extension to term phrase descriptors is the so-called index expression descriptor, or index

Reference-contexts: The table shown in Figure 14 summarizes the term probabilities for this example. The conditional probability assessment functions for variables representing binary index expressions are defined using the normalized connector occurrence frequencies shown in Figure 12. As a testing vehicle, the IDEAL system was used <ref> [SB90] </ref>. IDEAL is an environment for building and reasoning with belief networks.

Reference-contexts: The digraph constructed in the previous section and this set of assessment functions together define a belief network of index expressions. We conclude by observing that the approach presented differs from the one proposed H. Turtle and W.B.

Reference-contexts: Note that the complementary function value fl T (:t) can be computed using the equality fl T (:t) = 1 fl T (t). This approach to estimating the probability of occurrence of a term is common in information retrieval <ref> [WY90] </ref>. We now turn to vertices for which the set of parents consists of vertices with in-degree zero. These vertices correspond with variables that represent binary index expressions which are constructed from two terms via the addition of a connector.
