Abstract: The set I x = fy 2 A j fx; yg is unboundedg is an observable continuous representation of negative information about x 2 A for a weakly Hausdorff continuous dcpo A with the Scott topology. When A is not weakly Hausdorff the largest continuous approximation of I x is represented by J x = fy 2 A j x 2 Int(I y )g, and the largest observable continuous representation of I is represented by J 0 x = Int(J x ). Mike Smyth conjectured, that J or J 0 is closely related to the least symmetric closed tolerance on A. In this paper we establish that, indeed, fhx; yi j y 2 J 0 We also establish a relationship between this tolerance and lower bounds of relaxed metrics on A. 1 Introduction x g is the complement of this tolerance.

Reference-contexts: By representing negative information about x 2 A via J x or J 0 x , we were able to extend our approach for obtaining Scott continuous relaxed metrics <ref> [1] </ref> from bi-continuous valuations [7, 2] beyond bounded complete domains [3]. <p> Indeed, this is a symmetric, reflexive relation. To see that it is closed, consider a Scott continuous function l : A fi A ! R + , where R + is a segment <ref> [0; 1] </ref> with the usual ordering and the induced Scott topology, and observe that the set in question is the inverse image of a Scott closed set [0; *] R + under l 1 . The resulting family of tolerances parametrized by * is Scott continuous in the following sense. <p> Here R is the same segment of numbers, but with inverse ordering (x v y , x y), an element r 2 R corresponds to the open set (r; 1] R + , the element &gt; 2 R &gt; corresponds to the open set <ref> [0; 1] </ref> = R + , and domains R and R &gt; are equipped with the induced Scott topology. The function l 1 : R &gt; ! O (A fi A) is Scott continuous, and so is its restriction on R .

Reference-contexts: In Conclusion we focus on some of the potential uses of tolerances. 2 Basic Notions of Domain Theory The following basic notions and facts can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. Recall that a non-empty partially ordered set (poset), (S; v), is directed if 8x; y 2 S: 9z 2 S: x v z; y v z. <p> We define continuous Scott domains in the spirit of <ref> [4] </ref>. Consider a dcpo (A; v). We say that x t y (x is way below y) if for any directed set S A, y v tS ) 9s 2 S: x v s. An element x, such that x t x, is called compact.

Reference-contexts: Then one can prove that for any directed set B, J tB = b2B J b , implying that J is a Scott continuous function from A to P (D). Let us analyze this situation in the spirit of Stone duality <ref> [5, 11] </ref>, which is a contravariant equivalence between categories of spatial frames (of open sets) and sober topological spaces. <p> Now, since we are dealing with sober spaces (Scott topologies of continuous dcpo's are sober <ref> [5] </ref>), Stone duality means not only that u = J 1 can be obtained from the continuous function J , but also that the continuous function J can be restored from the frame morphism u.

Reference-contexts: We established that such relaxed metrics are Scott continuous and yield the Scott topology on A. Our approach worked especially well, when a continuous dcpo A obeyed the Lawson condition, that the relative Scott and Lawson topologies on T otal (A) coincide <ref> [8] </ref>. In this case, the induced relaxed metrics on A became ordinary metrics when restricted to T otal (A).

I y is a Scott continuous function A ! P (A). <p> The natural way to interpret the statement, that x and y can be distinguished, is to give some "effective" procedure for making such a distinction. Thus, the property of being distinguishable is observable <ref> [9] </ref>. Correspondingly, the property x ~ y is refutable, hence ~ should be closed. The fact that the least closed tolerance for a weakly Hausdorff continuous dcpo is " also is quite natural in this framework.
