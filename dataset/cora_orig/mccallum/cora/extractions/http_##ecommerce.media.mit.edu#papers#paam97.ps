Title: A Real-Life Experiment in Creating an Agent Marketplace

Abstract: Software agents help people with time consuming activities. One increasingly popular application for software agents is electronic commerce, namely having agents buy and sell goods and services on behalf of users. We recently conducted a real-life experiment in creating an agent marketplace, using a slightly modified version of the Kasbah system [Chavez96]. Approximately 200 participants intensively interacted with the system over a one-day, six-hour period. This paper describes the setup of the experiment, the architecture of the electronic market and the behaviors of the agents. We discuss the rationale behind the design decisions and analyze the results obtained. We conclude with a discussion of current experiments involving thousands of users interacting with the agent marketplace over a long period of time, and speculate on the long-range impact of this technology upon society and the economy.

Reference-contexts: Current efforts include the ability to pay at online stores with a credit card or with electronic cash and online listings of goods for sale which are more easily searchable. Some more interesting experiments which change the way transactions normally occur (and hence raise many issues) include BargainFinder <ref> [BF] </ref> and Fido [Fido]. Both of these systems present the concept of an agent which can shop for the best price for a good on behalf of a user. <p> Related Work There are many Web sites where people can go to find, buy, and sell goods <ref> [BF] </ref> [Fido] [OnSale] [UCE]. However, none of these sites has the notion of an autonomous agent which will actually do the work of negotiating to find the best possible deal on your behalf.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Software agents help people with time consuming activities [Maes95]. In the past, a range of roles for agents have been explored such as filtering information, automating repetitive tasks, and making referrals and introductions [PAAM96] <ref> [Bradshaw97] </ref>. One increasingly popular application for software agents is electronic commerce, namely having agents buy and sell goods and services on behalf of users.

Reference-contexts: Since 1994 the Software Agents group of the MIT Media Laboratory has embarked upon a research program to create electronic agent marketplaces. Chavez and Maes describe the architecture of Kasbah, an electronic marketplace where agents buy and sell to one another on behalf of their users <ref> [Chavez96] </ref>. The current paper reports on an experiment performed in October 1996 which involved a large group of people using a slightly revised Kasbah system. More specifically, about two hundred people intensively interacted with the system in a one-day, six-hour experiment. <p> When two agents make a deal with one another, they notify their respective users so that the transaction can be physically consummated. The design of the agents is derived from that of Kasbah <ref> [Chavez96] </ref>. However, the functionality was simplified after early user tests indicated that people may feel uncomfortable delegating a buying/selling task to an agent whose behavior is complex and difficult to predict.

Reference-contexts: Here the agents are not cooperating but acting selfishly. This can be a powerful and effective technique when dealing with difficult optimization problems. A good example of a market-based system is the Challenger system for allocating processing resources within a network of workstations <ref> [Chavez97] </ref>. For two earlier market-based agent approaches to resource allocation and equilibrium problems, see Enterprise [Malone88] and WALRAS [Cheng]. Much of this market-based research has stemmed from earlier work in economics and game theory [Rosenschein94].

Reference-contexts: This contrasts to a system such as Firefly [Shardanand95], where agents serve individual users (to make music recommendations), yet cooperate and exchange information in a mutually beneficial fashion. There has also been a lot of work done on market-based systems <ref> [Clearwater96] </ref>. The typical approach is to model an optimization problem, such as resource allocation, as a marketplace consisting of multiple agents, each trying to maximize their own utility. Notice how this differs from the traditional AI approach mentioned above where the agents are cooperating.

Reference-contexts: The notion of autonomous agents is not a new one. It appears extensively throughout computer science literature, in several different contexts. In the field of Distributed AI, agents are entities which collaborate to solve a specific problem <ref> [Demazeau90] </ref>. In Decentralized AI, the focus is more on the interactions of agents with different motivations. The underlying notion, though, is still that the agent interaction should further some organizational goals [Demazeau90]. <p> In the field of Distributed AI, agents are entities which collaborate to solve a specific problem <ref> [Demazeau90] </ref>. In Decentralized AI, the focus is more on the interactions of agents with different motivations. The underlying notion, though, is still that the agent interaction should further some organizational goals [Demazeau90]. Agents are often seen as a general technique for solving problems, be they very specific (planning the path of a robot) or broader (managing resources). This notion of agents is somewhat different from the one we take, which is more task-oriented.

Reference-contexts: goods) continuously enter and leave the marketplace buyers continuously enter and leave the marketplace sales occur whenever the buyers price is greater than or equal to the sellers price Strategic analysis of this type of auction is lacking in the economics and game theory literature relative to other auction types <ref> [Friedman93] </ref>. Our future research will explore potential strategies for this market model, including how dependencies among auctions influence them. This will help us create more sophisticated buying and selling strategies than the simple (but effective) ones used in this experiment.

Reference-contexts: Finally, a multiple agent system implies agent communication. This is also an area which has been extensively researched. KQML is perhaps the most notable attempt to design a general purpose agent language <ref> [Labrou94] </ref>. We chose not to use KQML, since our agents are all locally built and thus can be made to communicate via a predefined set of methods. More advanced agents might require a richer semantics of communication to enable more complex and subtle negotiations. <p> These will be used for defining goods that the system has not yet seen. We are also exploring protocols and semantics for defining more extensible agent marketplace communications and are researching several alternative protocols <ref> [Labrou94] </ref> [Telescript96]. The chosen protocol will be used to support the distribution of agents so they can either execute on the marketplace server or on a users local machine. This marketplace protocol will be open to allow third-party agents (with their own unique strategies) to participate in the agent marketplace.

Reference-contexts: Although the concept of our agent marketplace model is a continuous double auction, the implementation of our agent marketplace had elements of continuous English auctions and continuous Dutch auctions <ref> [Milgrom89] </ref>. Buyers continually raising their prices over time is consistent with the protocol of English (first-price, open-cry) auctions and sellers continually lowering their prices over time is consistent with the protocol of Dutch (first-price, sealed-bid) auctions.

Unlike most market-based systems, though, which exist strictly in a virtual world, our system is intended to be used by real people.

Our current efforts include using this feedback (along with our own analysis) to create an agent marketplace for the MIT-wide community.
