Abstract: It was shown recently by Clarke, Ledyaev, Sontag and Subbotin that any asymptotically controllable system can be stabilized by means of a certain type of discontinuous feedback. The feedback laws constructed in that work are robust with respect to actuator errors as well as to perturbations of the system dynamics. A drawback, however, is that they may be highly sensitive to errors in the measurement of the state vector. This paper addresses this shortcoming, and shows how to design a dynamic hybrid stabilizing controller which, while preserving robustness to external perturbations and actuator error, is also robust with respect to measurement error. This new design relies upon a controller which incorporates an internal model of the system driven by the previously constructed feedback.

Reference-contexts: The answer to the converse question: "Does asymptotic controllability imply feedback stabilization?" is not so obvious. In fact, the answer is negative if we consider only continuous feedback laws, as remarked in [15] and <ref> [2] </ref>. One must allow for discontinuous feedback.

Reference-contexts: The interesting part of this result lies in the construction of an s-stabilizing feedback for any asymptotically controllable system (1). This construction was based on: (a) the notion of control-Lyapunov function [13], (b) methods of nonsmooth analysis <ref> [3] </ref>, and (c) techniques from positional differential games [10, 5]. 1.2. Robustness Properties of Feedback The advantages of feedback over open-loop control are usually expressed in terms of robustness properties. The most obvious such property is the compensation for sudden changes in states.

Reference-contexts: Thus a totally different notion is needed. A natural and physically meaningful concept of solution of (2), which can be interpreted as stabilization by sampling at arbitrarily high sampling rates, was introduced in <ref> [4] </ref>. This concept allowed the proof of the general result: asymptotic controllability implies the existence of stabilizing feedback. The feedback laws constructed in that work are robust with respect to actuator errors as well as to perturbations of the system dynamics (1). <p> This new design relies upon a controller which incorporates an internal model of the system driven by the previously constructed feedback. We start by reviewing the relevant definitions and results from <ref> [4] </ref>. 1.1. <p> This definition is consistent with more classical notions of stabilization: if a continuous feedback k stabilizes the system (1) in the usual sense of making the origin of (2) globally asymptotically stable, then it also s-stabilizes (cf. <ref> [4] </ref>). The following definition of (global, null-) asymptotic controllability generalizes the classical concept of uniform asymptotic stability for control systems; it was introduced in [13]. <p> A relation between asymptotic controllability and feed back s-stabilization was established in <ref> [4] </ref>. Theorem 1 The system (1) is asymptotically control lable if and only if it admits an s-stabilizing feedback. The interesting part of this result lies in the construction of an s-stabilizing feedback for any asymptotically controllable system (1). <p> We will simply say that k is robustly s-stabilizing if for any disturbances a (), d () and errors e () satisfying (8) k is s-stabilizing for the perturbed system (7). It was shown in <ref> [4] </ref> that the s-stabilizing feedback constructed there is robust with respect to external disturbances and actuator errors in the absence of measurement errors. But the assumption that there is no measurement error, i.e. e () 0, is essential for establishing that fact. <p> An important component of this controller is an internal model of the system (1) under the action of the s-stabilizing feedback constructed in <ref> [4] </ref>. Our notion of s-stabilizing discontinuous feedback was based upon the notion of discontinuous feedback studied in the context of positional differential games by N.N. Krasovskii and A.I. Subbotin in [10]. <p> Re-Initialization Rules In this paper we prove Theorem 3 for the case of s-stabilizing feedback k defined in <ref> [4] </ref>. Let us describe some properties of this feedback which are used in the statement of the re-initialization rules for the internal model.
