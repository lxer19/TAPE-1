Abstract: Technical Report No. 1101 Department of Computer Science Yale University Abstract A jump system is a set of lattice points satisfying a certain exchange axiom. This notion was introduced by Bouchet and Cunningham [2], as a common generalization of (among others) the sets of bases of a matroid and degree sequences of subgraphs of a graph. We prove, under additional assumptions, a min-max formula for the distance of a lattice point from a jump system. The conditions are met in the examples above, and so our formula contains, as special cases, Tutte's f-factor-theorem and Edmonds' matroid intersection theorem.

Reference-contexts: While they can be solved for a rather large class of problems including the matching problem, no natural polynomially 1 solvable class of (say) the matroid parity problem is known that includes both matchings and matroid intersection. Jump systems were introduced by Bouchet and Cunningham <ref> [2] </ref>. The membership problem for jump systems can be viewed as another common generalization of the matching and matroid intersection problems, with an integer programming flavor. Jump systems are more general than matchoids, and the membership problem is NP-hard for some explicit jump-systems. <p> I am also grateful to Zoltan Szigeti and Andras Seb-o for reading an earlier version of this paper carefully and suggesting substantial improvements. 2 Jump systems The facts discussed in this section are (mostly) recalled from <ref> [2] </ref>. Let x and y be two lattice points in ZZ n . <p> Define their sum by J 1 + J 2 = fx 1 + x 2 : x i 2 J i g: It is not quite easy to prove that the sum of two jump systems is a jump system again (see <ref> [2] </ref> for a simple proof attributed to A. Seb-o). The degree system J G of a (quasi)-graph G is the sum of the sets J G e , where e 2 E and G e is the graph with node set V and edge set feg. <p> A greedy face is a jump system obtained by repeatedly taking simple faces. A greedy face can also be obtained as the set of points obtained by maximizing a linear objective function using the greedy algorithm. It follows by the results in <ref> [2, 4, 5] </ref> that, at least if the jump system is bounded, then every linear objective function can be maximized over it greedily, and if all the non-zero coefficients have different absolute value, then every optimum point will be obtained by the greedy algorithm. <p> A jump system is convex if it contains every integer point in its convex hull. It follows e.g. from corollary 5.3 below that every constant-sum jump system is convex. Convex jump systems have been studied in various disguises. It is proved in <ref> [2] </ref> that convex jump systems are the same as sets of lattice points in "bisubmodular polyhedra". We refer to [2] for a discussion of these polyhedra and their relationship with earlier research.

Reference-contexts: However, it will be very useful to work with this more general form of the problem. Our results will extend recent work by S. Fujishige <ref> [6] </ref>, who gives a min-max formula for the distance of a point from a bisubmodular polyhedron; this corresponds to the case when the jump system is convex.

Reference-contexts: While this condition is somewhat artificial and it does not capture all the polynomially solvable special cases (e.g., linear matroid parity, <ref> [9] </ref>) it does indicate the possibility of obtaining quite general results in the framework of jump systems. Hopefully this is not the last word in this direction. We say that a jump system has the odd-critical property if every projection of a greedy face that is 1-critical is also odd.

Reference-contexts: This reduction also shows that the membership problem has special cases which are poly-nomially unsolvable <ref> [10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It is therefore a natural idea to find a common generalization of them. Several common generalizations of these two basic problems have been proposed. Many of these turn out to be equivalent: matchoids, matroid parity, matchings in 2-polymatroids (see <ref> [11] </ref>, Chapter 11). Unfortunately, these problems are exponential time in the worst case in the oracle model, and NP-hard for appropriate special classes.
