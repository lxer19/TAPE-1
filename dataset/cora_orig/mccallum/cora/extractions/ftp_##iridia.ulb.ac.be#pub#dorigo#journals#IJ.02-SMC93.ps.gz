Reference-contexts: The motor signals emitted by each low-level classifier system are weighted signals and summed up to calculate the actual motor signals. This approach is quite similar to the approach developed by Arkin for his schema-based mobile robot navigation <ref> [1] </ref>, or the one of Holland and Snaith, who are using such a technique in their manifold architecture [15]. 1 6 Another important feature is the extendibility of the system: each time it encounters a novel situation for which no appropriate learnt behaviour exists, the system instantiates a new classifier system

Reference-contexts: The general ideas presented in our paper are very close to the work presented in the GOFER system <ref> [2] </ref>, but they extend the approach described there in the following respects: In the GOFER system, the Tinbergen model is just used as a framework to implicitly describe global robot behaviour (modularity, activation etc.). But the model is not explicitly represented in the system.

Reference-contexts: So far, no conceptual model of how behaviours are related to each other has been presented. Although some recent work has been reported on the use of genetic algorithm techniques within this approach <ref> [7] </ref>, we do not expect this more engineering-oriented 1 1 approach to behaviour-based robotics to give any deeper insights in the evolutionary processes mentioned above. We have to look for other methodologies to explain the emergence of adaptive behaviour.

Reference-contexts: We have developed a system architecture based on the model features that has been implemented on a transputer system. A more detailed description of this architecture can be found in <ref> [9] </ref>. The following paragraphs will briefly sketch what we call the complete model which represents to a large extent the functionalities of the Tinbergen model. The current implementation will be described by the socalled current model, which represents a subset of the complete model.

Reference-contexts: This direction is not based on whole chromosomes, but on their parts which are strongly related to high values of the fitness function: these parts are called building blocks [13], <ref> [10] </ref>. It has been proven [13] that GAs process at each cycle a number of building blocks proportional to the cube of the number of individuals of the population. <p> The net result is that classifiers that participate in 1 0 chains that cause high rewarded actions tend to increase their strength. A very good introduction to GAs and LCSs, explaining the basic algorithms in more detail, can be found in <ref> [10] </ref>. III. Behaviour-Based Robotics The main idea in the approach of behaviour-based robotics as an alternative to the traditional knowledge-based AI is that intelligent behaviour cannot be created in artificial systems without the ability to interact with a dynamically changing unstructured environment.

Reference-contexts: We believe that an integration between the two approaches could lead to systems with a still greater capacity to govern high degree of complexity. Last there is the work of Grefenstette <ref> [11] </ref>, where the problem of learning decision rules for sequential tasks is addressed. Grefenstette's work radically differs from ours in that he does not apply genetic operators to individual rules. Instead he recombines plans, where a plan in his terminology is a set of rules.

Reference-contexts: This fact resembles in some way the effect of coarse coding that can be observed in neural networks applications <ref> [12] </ref>, and deserves further investigation. Further investigation on more complex systems will be necessary to better understand how the system exploits the generation of internal structures and how these can be interpreted as internal representations.

It has been proven [13] that GAs process at each cycle a number of building blocks proportional to the cube of the number of individuals of the population. GAs are therefore useful for every problem where an optimal solution may be obtained as composition of a collection of building blocks. <p> Ethology and robotics are represented in our approach by the work of Tinbergen and of Brooks and his group at MIT. Their importance has already been sufficiently stressed in preceding sections and elsewhere [17]. The ideas developed in the field of machine learning firstly by Holland <ref> [13] </ref>, [14], and then formalized under the term "Animat problem" by Wilson [19] have been useful to our approach. The Animat problem is the problem faced by an artificial animal that has to learn how to survive in its environment.

Reference-contexts: However, we believe that these models are better suited as explanation models than the engineered ones based on the robot task, as the ethological models are based on the intensive observation of animal and human behaviour. Our approach The Tinbergen model <ref> [18] </ref> is a model of animal behaviour which we consider of great utility for our approach. In general one can describe this model as a hierarchy of behavioural modules or socalled instinct centers. <p> This mechanism serves to eliminate chaotic behaviour in the behavioural organization. A more detailed description of the model can be found in <ref> [18] </ref>. Fig.4 illustrates the hierarchical relation between the various instinct centers.

Reference-contexts: Instead of forming long sequences of action rules using the bucket-brigade algorithm in a single classifier system, the system reduces the length of related action rules by building individual action sequences and models of their interaction. As discussed also in <ref> [20] </ref>, the bucket-brigade algorithm may loose effectiveness as action sequences grow. Therefore the reduction of length of bucket-brigade chains would make reinforcement and learning faster.

Reference-contexts: Another major contribute to the understanding of how to apply learning classifier systems to the Animat problem is the work of Zhou <ref> [21] </ref>. In his CSM (Classifier System with Memory) system he addresses the problem of long versus short term memory, i.e. how to use past experience to ease the problem solving activity in novel situations. <p> Another important aspect to be investigated will be how to memorize, and use, past experience. Two solutions seem at this moment to be feasible: the use of explicit memory structures, as in the work of Zhou <ref> [21] </ref>, or the insertion of implicit memory structures in the system architecture.
