Abstract: Pharmaceutical drug design is a long and expensive process. Early selection of promising molecules can dramatically improve this process, but this selection is often similar to searching for a needle in a haystack. In most cases, all what a chemist initially has is a small collection of molecules that exhibit enough desired activity to hypothesize that they share a 3-D atomic substructure binding to the same receptor site. A key problem is to identify this substructure, which can then be used as a pattern to screen databases of molecules. This problem is complicated by the fact that a drug molecule is "flexible" and can achieve many low-energy (stable) states. In this paper we present search techniques that we have developed to find these low-energy states and to identify common 3-D substructures that appear in at least one low-energy state of most molecules in a given collection. We also show experimental results obtained with a software system implementing these techniques.

Reference-contexts: In its binding state, a subset of the ligand exhibits geometric and chemical complementarity with a cavity of the receptor called the binding site <ref> [4] </ref>. Many drug molecules are inhibitors, i.e., if a receptor cavity is a favorable environment for a reaction, a ligand that stably fills that cavity can prevent this reaction from happening.

Reference-contexts: But the geometric known inhibitors (1TMN) structures of relatively few receptors have been obtained via X-ray crystallography or NMR techniques. Thus, chemists must often identify drug molecules for receptors whose structure is unknown <ref> [5, 20] </ref>.

But this approach leads to a combinatorial explosion of the number of basic operations performed, and is limited to small sets of conformations per ligand <ref> [5] </ref>. For that reason, different approaches are being investigated. One of them, which we have proposed in [12], is based on probing conformations at random. We present it below and we give experimental results. We first describe a probing procedure to find invariants in two given point sets (pairwise matching).

Reference-contexts: Only low-energy conformations are stable. The problem is thus to identify a ligand that admits a low-energy conformation achieving good geometrical and chemical complementarity with the targeted binding site. When a 3-D model of this site is known, docking methods <ref> [6] </ref> exploit both the geometric and the chemical information available. But the geometric known inhibitors (1TMN) structures of relatively few receptors have been obtained via X-ray crystallography or NMR techniques. Thus, chemists must often identify drug molecules for receptors whose structure is unknown [5, 20]. <p> While quantum mechanics allows for a precise modeling of molecular behavior, it yields prohibitively expensive computations. Therefore, the energy function considered is usually an approximation based on van der Waals and Coulomb potentials [19]. Such approximation has produced meaningful results (e.g., see <ref> [6, 7] </ref>). Conformational search is a classical problem in computational chemistry. It includes protein folding [10], where one must find with great precision the conformation of a large molecule that achieves the global minimum of the energy function.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A basic assumption in rational drug design, which is supported by a number of experimental results <ref> [7] </ref>, is that the activity of a drug molecule also called a ligand results from the binding of this molecule to a larger molecule the receptor (usually, a protein). <p> In practice, only the torsional DOFs are considered because these are the only ones that achieve large variations <ref> [7] </ref>. In many drug molecules, the number of torsional DOFs ranges between 3 and 15; e.g., the 1TMN shown in Fig. 1 has 11 DOFs. The energy of a ligand is a function of its conformation. <p> While quantum mechanics allows for a precise modeling of molecular behavior, it yields prohibitively expensive computations. Therefore, the energy function considered is usually an approximation based on van der Waals and Coulomb potentials [19]. Such approximation has produced meaningful results (e.g., see <ref> [6, 7] </ref>). Conformational search is a classical problem in computational chemistry. It includes protein folding [10], where one must find with great precision the conformation of a large molecule that achieves the global minimum of the energy function. <p> Each generated conformation is retained only if it avoids intersections of nonbonded atoms (classically modelled by spheres of van der Waals radii <ref> [7] </ref>). An efficient minimizer [8] is then used to continuously deform the conformation until its energy is close to a local minimum.

Reference-contexts: Each generated conformation is retained only if it avoids intersections of nonbonded atoms (classically modelled by spheres of van der Waals radii [7]). An efficient minimizer <ref> [8] </ref> is then used to continuously deform the conformation until its energy is close to a local minimum. To eventually obtain a reduced, but yet representative set of low-energy conformations, we partition the optimized conformations into clusters that reflect geometric similarity as captured by a distance measure d.

Reference-contexts: To avoid considering a prohibitive number of conformations these methods rely on a very coarse discretization of the torsional values. They also use heuristics to terminate each gradient descent whenever the conformation gets close to a previous considered conformation. Randomized methods seem faster and more promising than systematic ones <ref> [9, 13] </ref>. Random sampling techniques have already been successfully applied to other high-dimensional search problems, like motion planning [15], where the shape of the underlying space is irregular. <p> Unlike previous randomized search methods, which apply random increments to the torsional DOFs starting with a user-specified initial conformation [13] or with a previously discovered low-energy conformation <ref> [9] </ref>, our method picks a random conformation by selecting each DOF from its allowed range according to a user-specified distribution reflecting any a priori information about the preferred values of the DOF [16].

Reference-contexts: The same observation holds for confor-mational search: a systematic procedure has a higher chance of missing the irregularly shaped basins of attraction of the energy landscape of the ligand [13]. We describe below one method in more detail, which we have developed and tested <ref> [11] </ref>. 2.2 Randomized Search Initially, a large number of conformations are picked at random. <p> For example, if in a given conformation an atom (modeled by a sphere) does not contribute a significant portion of its surface to the total molecular surface, this atom is unlikely to play a binding role, and thus could be discarded to reduce the size of the point sets <ref> [11] </ref>. 3.4 Experimental results Consider again the four inhibitors of thermolysin shown in Fig. 2, for which the pharmacophore was well-known prior to our experiments. Subsets of conformations produced by the software of Section 2 were input to the multi-probe algorithm described above.

Reference-contexts: This substructure, called a pharmacophore, is then regarded as a partial complement of the receptor's binding site, and is used as a template to find more potent ligands <ref> [14] </ref>. For example, one may screen large databases of ligands to extract those molecules which have a low-energy conformation that contains the pharmacophore [21]. Measuring the activity of these molecules allows the selection of more potent ligands, which in turn may yield more pertinent phar-macophores.
