Reference-contexts: A new attack has been discovered in a variant of the Otway-Rees protocol. The inductive approach has also been tailored to analyse real-world protocols. The first one tackled in this field is Kerberos <ref> [5, 1] </ref>, whose analysis has fl Giampaolo.Bella@cl.cam.ac.uk y Larry.Paulson@cl.cam.ac.uk required some effort for the mechanism of broadcast of a session key to the intended recipients which relies on the presence of two different trusted third parties. <p> A complete formalisation pointing out rigorously all the numerous details of the operation of Kerberos has been only recently achieved by means of the Gurevich's Abstract State Machine <ref> [1] </ref>, but lacks automation. That work has been the basis to ours, which is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to mechanise such a complex protocol. 3 The Inductive Method For the entire treatment of the method, we refer to [8]. <p> Since the authentication key has a long lifetime, it is used to encrypt many service keys, so, from learning one authentication key, the spy could obtain a considerable number of other session keys. This addresses a protocol weakness already mentioned in <ref> [1] </ref>. The temporality of Kerberos suggested the definition of a new class of theorems, called temporal properties, expressing relations about the timestamps. They emphasise the key role played by the lifetimes, and can suggest the right values for them.

Reference-contexts: Each timestamp is obviously taken as the current time, which is formalised by the function CT mapping the current trace into an integer. Four lifetimes are defined as global constants, since sending the lifetimes inside the messages is a redundancy already addressed in <ref> [2] </ref>. AuthLife is the lifetime of the authentication key and usually lasts several hours; each authentication key can be used within this lifetime between Alice and Tgs.

Reference-contexts: However, none of these methods can claim that a protocol is mathematically secure. A combination of different methods might yield the best results. For instance, the use of a belief logic <ref> [3] </ref> during the design phase might help ensure freshness properties, and the use of a state enumeration method [4] might pinpoint simple flaws quickly. Deeper structural properties might be proved by way of the inductive method. <p> Although the use of Kerberos as an authentication system for LANs is today widespread, the literature contains little work about the application of formal methods to it. This was the main motivation to our choice. Until a short time ago, the work of Burrows et al. <ref> [3] </ref> was the only significant attempt, but showed very few properties and has been widely criticised. A complete formalisation pointing out rigorously all the numerous details of the operation of Kerberos has been only recently achieved by means of the Gurevich's Abstract State Machine [1], but lacks automation.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Since Needham and Schroeder pioneered in <ref> [6] </ref> that protocol errors are unlikely to be detected in normal operations and that the need for techniques to verify the correctness of such protocols is great, a number of methods have been developed to analyse cryptographic protocols.

Reference-contexts: Using such a method, some famous cryptographic protocols of the literature have been analysed with the support of the generic theorem prover Isabelle. Several guarantees (nearly two hundred theorems in all) have been established about the following protocols: Needham-Schroeder (both shared-key and public-key), Otway-Rees, Yahalom <ref> [8, 9, 10] </ref>. A new attack has been discovered in a variant of the Otway-Rees protocol. The inductive approach has also been tailored to analyse real-world protocols. <p> That work has been the basis to ours, which is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to mechanise such a complex protocol. 3 The Inductive Method For the entire treatment of the method, we refer to <ref> [8] </ref>. Only some guidelines are given here. 3.1 Overview The inductive method rests on the notion of event. Each time an agent A sends an agent B a message X, the event Says A B X 2 occurs in our model. <p> Therefore, the set synth (analz (sees Spy evs)) 3 denotes all the fraudulent messages the spy can send by observing the trace evs. A spy able to send such a large number of messages has a potentially infinite behaviour <ref> [8] </ref> which goes beyond the limits of formalisations by state-enumeration methods. 3.3 Guarantees Guarantees about the protocol operation are established in terms of theorems proved by Isabelle. When such proofs fail, they help to point out weaknesses of the protocol and even possible bugs. <p> When such proofs fail, they help to point out weaknesses of the protocol and even possible bugs. This is how a new bug in a variant of the Otway-Rees protocol has been discovered in <ref> [8] </ref>. The guarantees mentioned in [8] belong to five families. Possibility properties are usually the first to be dealt with. The most important one consists in showing that there are traces that reach the end of the protocol. <p> When such proofs fail, they help to point out weaknesses of the protocol and even possible bugs.

Possibility properties are usually the first to be dealt with.

Then, the gist of the protocol should arise easily. 4.1 Guarantees about Kerberos Proving for Kerberos the possibility properties and the regularity lemmas already established for other protocols in <ref> [8] </ref> has not required much effort. 5 New forwarding lemmas have been established. <p> set of list evs; Says Tgs' A (Crypt AuthKey f|ServKey, Agent B, Tt, ServTicket|g) 2 set of list evs|] =) Tt Tk + AuthLife 5 Conclusion A framework for the analysis of cryptographic protocols based on the inductive method has been developed within Isabelle and applied to some case studies <ref> [8] </ref>. This paper has discussed the analysis of Kerberos by means of that framework. Kerberos was chosen because it is a popular authentication system which was still lacking a mechanised analysis.

Reference-contexts: As for the secrecy theorems, not surprisingly the proof that no session key is used to encrypt other session keys failed. The reason is that the authentication key encrypts the service key; therefore, the theorem could be proved only for service keys. Proof methods recently applied to Yahalom <ref> [11] </ref> may yield results for Kerberos also. Since the authentication key has a long lifetime, it is used to encrypt many service keys, so, from learning one authentication key, the spy could obtain a considerable number of other session keys. This addresses a protocol weakness already mentioned in [1].
