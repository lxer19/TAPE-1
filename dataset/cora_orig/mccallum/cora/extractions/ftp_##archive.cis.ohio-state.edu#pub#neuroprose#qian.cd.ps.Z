Reference-contexts: Consequently, the disparity tuning curves obtained with two sets of independently generated spatial noise patterns will have different 4 Y-D. Zhu and N. Qian peak locations. This result was confirmed previously through computer simulations for simple cells with the phase-parameter based RF model <ref> (Qian, 1994a) </ref>. Similar simulation results for a simple cell with the position-shift based RF model are shown in Fig. 2. Here the disparity tuning curves of a simple cell to two sets of independently generated random dot patterns are plotted. <p> Frequency pooling is therefore most likely to occur at a stage beyond complex cells, perhaps at the level of MT (Grzywacz and Yuille, 1990). We have previously developed a physiologically realistic algorithm for disparity computation using the phase-parameter based RF description <ref> (Qian, 1994a) </ref>. The algorithm relies on the same simple and complex cell response models as described in this paper, and uses a population of complex cells to encode stimulus disparity. <p> Qian description since Equation 11 indicates that a population of complex cells with the position-shift based RF models can also form a distributed representation of stimulus disparity. We have performed computer simulations using the algorithm with both types of RF models. The computed disparity maps from random dot stereograms <ref> (Qian, 1994a) </ref> using the two different RF models are very similar to each other, both agree well with the actual disparity map (results not shown). However, under certain conditions, the computed disparity maps using different RF models may be somewhat different. This is the case for sinusoidal grating stimuli. <p> Likewise, the normalization procedure will not affect our recent algorithm <ref> (Qian, 1994a) </ref> for disparity computation either since the algorithm only relies on the location of peak disparity responses. We have also suggested new methods for distinguishing the phase-parameter based and the position-shift based RF models.

Reference-contexts: We will also consider the possibility of a hybrid model and demonstrate how to determine the relative contributions of position shifts and phase parameters to the disparity tuning of real cells. Some preliminary results have been reported previously in abstract form <ref> (Qian, 1994b) </ref>. 2 Analyses and Simulations Since we are only concerned with horizontal disparity, we will use one-dimensional RF profiles in our analyses and simulations.

Reference-contexts: Also note that the temporal dimension of the RFs and stimulus is not included since we have shown elsewhere that it does not affect the disparity tuning of a cell unless an interocular time delay is introduced <ref> (Qian and Andersen, 1996) </ref>. With Equation 5, the responses of simple cells can be calculated for any given RF profiles and stimuli, either numerically or analytically. The details of our mathematical analysis are given in the Appendix.

Reference-contexts: The quality of the computed disparity maps from random dot stereograms with the pooling step added is significantly better than those without the pooling step, especially at disparity boundaries <ref> (Qian and Zhu, 1995) </ref>. Our algorithm for disparity computation also works with the position-shift based RF 16 Y-D. Zhu and N. Qian description since Equation 11 indicates that a population of complex cells with the position-shift based RF models can also form a distributed representation of stimulus disparity.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, pooling across different spatial frequency scales would render complex cells much less sensitive (i.e., more broadly tuned) to spatial frequency than simple cells, contradictory to the actual experimental data <ref> (Shapley and Lennie, 1985) </ref>. Frequency pooling is therefore most likely to occur at a stage beyond complex cells, perhaps at the level of MT (Grzywacz and Yuille, 1990). We have previously developed a physiologically realistic algorithm for disparity computation using the phase-parameter based RF description (Qian, 1994a).

Reference-contexts: an overestimation of the phase in the grating tuning curves because 1 P N 1 N + 1 P N N + 1 = ! 0 (The inequility can be proved for any positive ! 0 and i that are not all identical to each other.) Since the squared deviation <ref> (Wagner and Frost, 1993) </ref> of the phase-parameter model is already quite small (although larger than that of the position-shift model), even a small bias in the estimation of the model prediction could have significant consequences. <p> In conclusion, our work provides a thorough characterization of the disparity tuning of simple and complex cells under the two different types of RF descriptions (and their hybrid) suggested by previous physiological experiments. These results not only provide an explanation of many aspects of the recent physiological data of <ref> (Wagner and Frost, 1993) </ref> but also generate specific predictions which may help guide future experimental determination Binocular Receptive Field Models and Disparity Tuning 17 of the neural mechanisms of disparity selectivity.

Reference-contexts: In addition, in the expanded version of Wagner and Frost (1993) the authors mentioned that during their experiments, "single units were difficult to isolate", and that the majority of the recordings were multi-unit <ref> (Wagner and Frost, 1994) </ref>. Consequently, many of their measured tuning curves were the average from several different cells. It is inappropriate to apply CD analysis to multi-unit recordings unless the cells in a given recording were all complex and all had identical disparity tuning.
