Abstract: The bandwidth problem is the problem of numbering the vertices of a given graph G so that the maximum difference between the numbers of adjacent vertices is minimal. The topological bandwidth problem is a natural extension of the bandwidth problem. It is the problem of numbering the vertices of a homeomorphic image of a given graph G so that the maximum difference between the numbers of adjacent vertices is minimal, over all numberings and images. Both problems have a long history and they are known to be NP -hard [Pa 76], [MPS 85]. In this paper we present the first P T AS for the topological bandwidth of trees. Furthermore we construct n * -approximation algorithms for the bandwidth of graphs with minimum degree n ffi , for any ffi; * &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we develop an approximation scheme for the topological bandwidth of trees, by relating the topological bandwidth to the cutwidth. In Section 3 we use random sampling techniques of Dessmark, Dorgerloh, Lingas and Wirtgen <ref> [DDLW 98] </ref> to construct spanner like trees. <p> A set of k = fi (log (n)n=d (n)) randomly chosen vertices R forms a dominating set with high probability. Clearly if the minimum degree is in fi (n), then k can be chosen to be fi (log n) ([KWZ 97], <ref> [DDLW 98] </ref>). Such graphs are called dense. Proof: The probability, that one particular vertex v will be dominated by one of the randomly chosen vertices, is at least d (n)=n. <p> Using Lemma 3.8 and Lemma 3.9 we get a layout f , such that B (f; G) O (n * B (f 0 ; T 0 )) O (n 3* log nB (G)) For dense graphs we can even improve this result, by using Lemma 3.4 and the results of <ref> [DDLW 98] </ref>. Theorem 3.11 Let G be a dense graph.
