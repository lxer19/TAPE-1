Abstract: This paper presents a new model-based egomotion estimation algorithm for an autonomous vehicle navigating through rough terrain. Due to the uneven terrain, the vehicle undergoes bouncing, pitch and roll motion. To reliably accomplish other tasks such as tracking and obstacle avoidance using visual inputs, it is essential to consider these disturbances. In this paper, two vehicle models available in the literature are used for egomotion estimation. The Half Vehicle Model (HVM) takes into account the bouncing and pitch motion of the vehicle, and the Full Vehicle Model (FVM) also considers the roll motion. The dynamics of the vehicle are formulated using standard equations of motion. Assuming that depth information is known for some landmarks in the scene (e.g., obtained from a laser range finder), a feature-based approach is proposed to estimate vehicle motion parameters such as the vertical movement of the center of mass and the instantaneous angular velocity. An Iterated Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) is used for recursive parameter estimation. Simulation results for both known and unknown terrain are presented.

Reference-contexts: Eight feature points were used in both models. Instead of randomly generating these feature points, we used feature points from the Rocket ALV sequence, in which ground truth is available <ref> [6, 15] </ref>. Note that in this above sequence, the camera moves along a straight path toward the left. In our experiment, we shifted each point upward and to the right by 10.0 so that the corresponding 13 image point would be close to the center of the image.

Reference-contexts: In order to describe the pitch and roll motion of the vehicle's body, we need to find its orientation with respect to the inertial coordinate system|in other words, we need to find the rotation matrix which aligns V with I. There are many ways to represent this rotation matrix <ref> [9] </ref>. Since the instantaneous angular velocity changes with time, we use a quaternion representation. In the following, a vector P is denoted by P I if its components are represented in I, and by P V if they are represented in V .
