Title: 1 GIPSY (Georeferenced Information Processing SYstem)  
Author: Allison Gyle Woodruff 
Address: Davis  
Affiliation: Computer Science Department University of California,  
Abstract: In current information retrieval systems, geographically-based searches such as "Find me all documents whose content pertains to location X" are not supported directly by indexing, query, and display functions. Instead, these searches at best exist only as side-effects of keyword indexing. Because of problems relating to ambiguity, synonymy, and other linguistic phenomena, the use of keyword indexing to indicate geographic location can lead to inaccurate and/or misleading references. The initial portion of this paper presents the motivation for georeferencing text and previous work in this area. The next portion discusses a needs assessment presenting two studies documenting the frequency and composition of geographic queries in information retrieval systems. The first study is an examination of commands executed in a university online bibliographic catalog. The second study shows searches done by natural resources managers. The final portion of this paper details a new model for supporting geographically-based access to text. In this model, words and phrases containing geographic place names and geographic characteristics are extracted from a document. These terms are then used as input to database functions which use spatial reasoning to statistically approximate the location being referred to in the document. Advantages and disadvantages of this model are discussed.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, a few of the bins contain identical information because there were many searches which returned the same number of records. For example, more than 2,500 searches, nearly the first third of the searches, returned zero records. (In general, roughly 1/3 of Melvyl searches return zero records <ref> [Berg92] </ref>.) Therefore, the first third of the bins have the same value. This method of presentation was chosen to more accurately represent the distribution of the data values. 3.1.4.

Reference-contexts: An information retrieval system must share a common language with the user [Batt89]. Lack of communication caused by the complications listed above has made retrieval by geographic indexes difficult. Inconsistency and ambiguity in Library of Congress geographic subject headings, for example, has been discussed at length in <ref> [Brin62] </ref>, [Misc82], and [Well78]. Because coordinates, unlike text, are non-ambiguous [Holm90], they can be used to uniquely communicate locations to the user. Therefore, a georeferencing facility should make use of coordinate indexing. Furthermore, many users require proximity queries which can not be supported by textual terms. <p> The physical size of the catalog limited the number of index terms for a document <ref> [Brin62] </ref>; the computational complexity of automatic indexing techniques were limited by cpu speed; authority control created consistency and update problems; and, since documents were not on-line, they could not easily be indexed through electronic means. These factors, and many others, are changing rapidly. <p> The first consists of topical subject headings followed by a geographic subdivision (e.g. ART - PARIS). The second consists of a place name followed by a topical subdivision (e.g. U.S. - HISTORY). The third consists of a phrase which begins with a geographical adjective (e.g. NORWEGIAN LITERATURE) <ref> [Brin62] </ref>. These have sev eral well-documented problems: Inconsistent Subheadings A text document is most often assigned only one of the three types of indexes. Historically, this limit has been enforced to limit the size of the entire catalog. <p> Historically, this limit has been enforced to limit the size of the entire catalog. However, the procedure for choosing which type of index is appropriate for various documents has not been well-specified. The consequent inconsistency makes it exceptionally difficult for a user to locate reliably items of interest <ref> [Brin62] </ref>. Scatter Subdivision can also fragment references. Mischo [Misc82] writes that: "Single entry specific headings with more than one subdivision cause serious problems of scatter.

Reference-contexts: In these searches, the documents being retrieved cross many subject areas, and are of many different document types (e.g. journals, newspapers, magazines, etc.). This often makes a comprehensive search difficult, as Byron <ref> [Byro87] </ref> observes: "Bradford's Law of S cattering does not apply only to the literature of science and technology: articles in the arts, humanities and social sciences also appear in unlikely periodicals, so that the task of achieving comprehensive coverage in a subject library is rendered impossible. <p> Authors such as Byron <ref> [Byro87] </ref>, and the Research Libraries Group [RLG89] have therefore recognized the need for research, development, and implementation of geographic indexing. Furthermore, in many cases, the users listed above will also wish to access and integrate text documents with other kinds of data such as photographs or maps.

Reference-contexts: Another issue pertaining to parsing is the granularity of the document to be indexed. Furthermore, extraction of the relationships among the key words and phrases will also be of interest. One useful relationship should be extracted by segmentation work being done by Hearst <ref> [Hear92] </ref>. In segmentation, consideration of locality and density of keywords is taken into account. This will facilitate making distinctions between distinct geographic areas which are represented within a document.

Reference-contexts: It would be useful to compare GIPSY techniques to text indexes. The only related work in this area is a disseration which consists primarily of a benchmarking effort <ref> [Hill90] </ref>. The text corpus and the techniques used in Hill's study do not seem easily duplicable. Because GIPSY is not directly comparable to any existing system, bench-marking should be done after GIPSY is more mature.

In these systems, the user generally specificies the coordinates of a box or point of interest. More recently, prototypes have been developed which allow map-based interfaces to documents including images and tabular data as well as text [RLG89], <ref> [Holm90] </ref>. However, none of these systems has included automatic assignment of coordinates. Therefore, the popularity of these systems has been limited by the lack of automatic indexing and by their primitive interface mechanisms. 3.

Reference-contexts: Korfhage [Korf91] has in fact argued that all information in a database should be on display to allow the user to make an informed query.

In this model, users receive insufficient information about what documents in the returned set are most pertinent to their searches.

Reference-contexts: The CATALOG database (like most systems) simply presents retrieved records in alphabetical order, giving no information about which records might be most pertinent to the user's search.

Reference-contexts: Lack of communication caused by the complications listed above has made retrieval by geographic indexes difficult. Inconsistency and ambiguity in Library of Congress geographic subject headings, for example, has been discussed at length in [Brin62], [Misc82], and <ref> [Well78] </ref>. Because coordinates, unlike text, are non-ambiguous [Holm90], they can be used to uniquely communicate locations to the user. Therefore, a georeferencing facility should make use of coordinate indexing. Furthermore, many users require proximity queries which can not be supported by textual terms. <p> Library of Congress Subject Headings Although the Library of Congress did not originally intend to develop a standardized subject protocol [Misc82], the procedures used at the Library of Congress have impact on an international scale <ref> [Well78] </ref>. Therefore, perhaps the most significant example of manually-generated geographic indexes comes from the Library of Congress. There are three types of geographic indexing in Library of Congress Subject Headings. The first consists of topical subject headings followed by a geographic subdivision (e.g. ART - PARIS). <p> Delays in accepting more current nomenclature to replace older terms are - 8 - frequent. For example, it wasn't until 1972 that ELECTRONIC CALCU LATING MACHINES became COMPUTERS." (pg. 108) Furthermore, geographic terms have content which is dependent upon the time period to which they refer. Wellisch <ref> [Well78] </ref> discusses some of the problems which arise from attempts to use a single geographic term to refer to an area: "The instructions tell us to assign the heading Banks and Banking - Zaire - Kinshasa to a work on banking in Leopoldville, Belgian Congo, published in 1950. <p> This is exemplified by inconsistencies in the Library of Congress Subject Headings practice in assigning indexes. For example, the procedure for deciding whether islands should appear as high level entities, or as subdivisions, is discussed in <ref> [Well78] </ref>: "Now, catalogers in the Library of Congress can, of course, arbitrarily decide what is to be an island in its own right, entered directly, and what is to be subordinated to another geographical entity.
