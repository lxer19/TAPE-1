Reference-contexts: When patch quality cannot reliably be predicted by the parent, but can be predicted from environmental cues experienced by the offspring, ESD is favoured [CB77]. Among others, ESD occurs in plants [LB84, Zim91]; nematodes [BlC89], crustaceans <ref> [NAG88a, AGN87] </ref>; fish [CK81, LC93]; and reptiles [Bul80, DF88, Jan92].

Necessarily, many of these studies have concentrated on sex determined by genotype at conception, although for many organisms there may be a selective advantage to determination of sex with respect to environmental cues [CB77, WC78, Cha82, BC88].

Reference-contexts: Essentially the rate of drift is a function of effective population size, and the recombination rate is dependent on the degree of linkage of the genes. Traditional analyses of these complex systems assume that linkage is low <ref> [Bar86] </ref>, however other authors [Wri68] suggest that linkage between related genes may be very high. However there are some observations that we can make dependent on the relative speed of the underlying rates in the system: * Recombination very much slower than drift.

Reference-contexts: Where cytology has not identified heteromorphism, gender appears to be determined by one or more major sex factors, and in some cases by the actions of many minor sex factors, (the terms are relative; reviewed in <ref> [Bul83, Ohn79] </ref>). In this paper we develop models relating to major and minor factor control systems, which we term multifactorial or polygenic. <p> The dynamics of multilocus or polygenic factors for determining organism phenotype have been widely studied <ref> [Win34, Wri39, Kos64, Wri68, Wri69, KL86, Bul83, Poe88, TB90, Nag93] </ref> and the effect of using such a system for sex determination has been studied in [Win34, Kos64, Wri69, KL86, Poe88]. <p> The second is where sex is purely genetically determined; the system evolving to one of two states where sex is determined according to the genotype based on one chromosome pair (sex chromosomes; [Ohn67]). These states (reviewed in <ref> [Bul83] </ref>) are male heterogamety (male is XY, female is XX; as in mammals) and female heterogamety (female is ZW, male is ZZ; e.g., birds). The third solution is essentially a combination of the previous two.

Unlike the analysis of [BB82] we shall not assume that the polyfactors are normally distributed and then look for a single control point which induces stability. <p> The third solution is essentially a combination of the previous two. Its existence in natural populations has not been explicitly demonstrated, although 21 there is considerable evidence of mixed ESD/genotypic systems which may conform to the structure <ref> [BVB82, NAG88a, LC93, CVE92, Jan92, WA94] </ref>. Whilst it is known [Ric86] that polygenic sex determination is unstable to invasion by mutants, we have demonstrated that in finite populations polygenic systems of sex determination are intrinsically unstable.

Reference-contexts: These latter observations concur with some recent genetic observations where DNA sequences homologous to known sex factors on sex chromosomes have been found widely distributed throughout the autosomes [Sin88]. These factors appear to be present in wide range of species <ref> [DF88, BHS88, Pag87] </ref>. Indeed [Pag87] suggest that a possible model consistent with their findings would be one of additive sex factors. From the perspective of the original problem of distinct ESD and GSD Gammarus populations, the outcome is very satisfactory.

Reference-contexts: Unlike the analysis of <ref> [BB82] </ref> we shall not assume that the polyfactors are normally distributed and then look for a single control point which induces stability. <p> That is we are studying the structural stability of our genetic model of ESD. The analysis of polygenes for other behaviours [TB90] suggests that it is highly unlikely that the distribution of polyfactors will be Guassian as assumed by <ref> [BB82] </ref>. Thus it is of great importance to know what the underlying distribution of our factors should be in the absence of an enviromental bias giving advantage to particular individuals. <p> There are several observations that can be made about special cases for the limits Low and High and their effects on the solution classes possible. If Low + 1 = High (for example Low = 12 and High = 13, see also <ref> [BB82] </ref>) that is the boundaries are adjacent, then there is no space for type 1 or 3 solutions to occur and we have only XY and ZW type solutions occuring.

Reference-contexts: An application of these methodologies to the behaviour of social insects can be found in [Tof90b, Tof91, Tof93a, Tof93b] and their biological consequences in [THF92]. Evolutionary systems are increasingly of interest to computer scientists as the methods are often used for exploration of complex systems, via genetic algorithms <ref> [Dav87, Gol89, BB91, Dav91] </ref>. The behaviour of genetic algorithms is highly complex and providing appropriate formal analysis techniques for such computational methodologies is difficult. From a computing prespective an evolutionary system is a large scale parallel device which optimises its use of resources.

Reference-contexts: For our purposes the random region represents that area in which the environment can potentially have an effect on the outcome of sex determination, although we do not model ESD explicitly. The model methodology that we adopt is essentially a formal individual based techinique, Process Algebra. Process algebra <ref> [Mil90, Mil80, BW90, Hoa85, Hen88] </ref> is particularly appropriate to the modelling of evolutionary systems as it permits us to track precisely the genetic make up of every individual within a population.

From the perspective of experimental design, most of the solutions give a small number of possible outcomes for offspring sex ratio, dependent on the particular female/male cross. The populations with the most complex structure are those that arise as a probabilistic type 3.

Reference-contexts: If the animal doesn't recombine then we need to wait an extra tick to allow the system to resynchronise. Recombination allows gene counts that have been lost to be reintroduced, it is a mech anism for avoiding the consequences of `bad' choices (Muller's ratchet <ref> [Mul64, Fel74] </ref>). Unfortunately for an analysis of the stable solutions of our system recombination is a ma jor challenge. The behaviour of the system is given by a dynamic competition between drift removing rare genotypes and recombination reintroducing them.

Reference-contexts: under finite population assumptions the deterministic system evolves to one of three basic forms of stability: 1. monogenic purely random sex determination (all individuals genetically identical); 2. two factor pure genetic sex determination; 3. two factor mixed sex determination; with each showing a 50/50 sex ratio as we should expect <ref> [Fis30] </ref> in our sexually unbiased system. The non-deterministic system evolves into one of two solution types; either 1 or 3 of above. <p> Since 2a &lt; 4 there is no choice for the b value chromosome since b 20 with b + a 25. 2.2 How stability arises (Informally) Of note is the longstanding observation that sexual animals should allocate the sex of their offspring on a 50/50 basis <ref> [Fis30] </ref> 9 . This results from the observation that if the population has a biased ratio in favour of either sex then an animal can ensure a greater proportion of its genes will be present in the population in 2 generations time by producing more of the rarer sex. <p> The stable solutions of the system arise as the result of the interaction of two forces: 9 More preciseley equal resources should be invested in each sex 9 * the `rare female effect' <ref> [Fis30] </ref>; * probabilistic symmetry breaking. The first force is the result of departure from Fisherian [Fis30] sex ratio. If this occurs then the rarer sex will get to breed more frequently thus increasing its numbers in the subsequent generations. The second force results from the absence of selection. <p> The stable solutions of the system arise as the result of the interaction of two forces: 9 More preciseley equal resources should be invested in each sex 9 * the `rare female effect' <ref> [Fis30] </ref>; * probabilistic symmetry breaking. The first force is the result of departure from Fisherian [Fis30] sex ratio. If this occurs then the rarer sex will get to breed more frequently thus increasing its numbers in the subsequent generations. The second force results from the absence of selection. <p> The outcome is purely the result of two processes that affect factor frequencies in the gene pool. Random drift reduces genetic variability as a consequence of sampling error in finite populations [Wri68, Wri69]. Fisherian selection <ref> [Fis30] </ref> maintains only those combinations of factors that yield an unbiased population sex ratio; this latter process occurs as the rarer sex necessarily makes a relatively greater genetic contribution to the following generation.

Reference-contexts: Finally it is possible within the same basic genetic system to have both environmental and genetic sex determination. In a general sense the process algebraic approach to the description of evolutionary systems has great potential. The question of the effect of point of gene expression on evolutionary dynamics <ref> [HT94a] </ref> may be very precisely addressed in this context. Within our process algebraic description is a very general evolutionary system which could be exploited to investigate problems of evolution other than sex.

Reference-contexts: Essentially recombination has an effect as structure starts to emerge in the system. If it is `strong enough' to break down the structure then it will probably never emerge, otherwise the structures we see can emerge despite the presence of the recombination. In simulo <ref> [HT94b] </ref> rates of recombination of much greater than 1/10,000 in a population of 2000 animals caused the system to start to oscillate, and recombinant rates of the order of 1/100 cause a complete loss of any structure.

Reference-contexts: When patch quality cannot reliably be predicted by the parent, but can be predicted from environmental cues experienced by the offspring, ESD is favoured [CB77].

It is usually supposed that ESD has multifactorial genetic underpinnings as (1) adaptive interpretations of ESD imply selection, which requires that some aspects of ESD are heritable, and (2) it is difficult to envisage how ESD could be encoded under simple chromosomal sex determination [BVB82, CVE92]. <p> The third solution is essentially a combination of the previous two.

Whilst it is known [Ric86] that polygenic sex determination is unstable to invasion by mutants, we have demonstrated that in finite populations polygenic systems of sex determination are intrinsically unstable.

Reference-contexts: If the animal doesn't recombine then we need to wait an extra tick to allow the system to resynchronise. Recombination allows gene counts that have been lost to be reintroduced, it is a mech anism for avoiding the consequences of `bad' choices (Muller's ratchet <ref> [Mul64, Fel74] </ref>). Unfortunately for an analysis of the stable solutions of our system recombination is a ma jor challenge. The behaviour of the system is given by a dynamic competition between drift removing rare genotypes and recombination reintroducing them.

That is we are studying the structural stability of our genetic model of ESD. The analysis of polygenes for other behaviours <ref> [TB90] </ref> suggests that it is highly unlikely that the distribution of polyfactors will be Guassian as assumed by [BB82]. Thus it is of great importance to know what the underlying distribution of our factors should be in the absence of an enviromental bias giving advantage to particular individuals. <p> In this case the system will tend to be constantly in flux between different possible stable solutions, occasionally residing in one for a period before moving off to another. * Recombination faster than drift. The system never stabilises but the observed distribution of polyfactors is highly non-Guassian <ref> [TB90] </ref>. The effect of sex selection forbids certain states and the system will tend to avoid them. Essentially recombination has an effect as structure starts to emerge in the system. <p> It is clear from our results that the assumption that the stable distribution for polygenic sex determining factors is Guasssian is false (as in <ref> [TB90] </ref>) if there is a high degree of linkage, even if the factors are distributed over many chromosome pairs. Of particular interest is the observation that generally if the factors are distributed over many chromosomes then one (occasionally two) pairs will end up with absolute influence on sex determination.

Evolutionary systems are increasingly of interest to computer scientists as the methods are often used for exploration of complex systems, via genetic algorithms [Dav87, Gol89, BB91, Dav91].

Reference-contexts: of our three solution types, it is extremely difficult (and highly parameter dependent) to demonstrate which solutions it will arrive at with what probability. 2.3 Stability (Formally) In order to demonstrate that the system will eventually reach one of the stable states stated above we have to demonstrate two facts <ref> [Tof94] </ref>: 1. the sets of states given by those situations are themselves closed (stable); 2. from an arbitrary state one or more of the stable sets is reachable.

Reference-contexts: To that end we will describe sex as being determined by a polygene whose intensity defines the prediposition towards a particular sex (male). Of particular interest to us are two separate populations of Gammarus duebeni, one of which shows conventional genetic sex determination and the other ESD <ref> [NAG88a, NAG88b, WA94] </ref>. The allocation of resources to each sex within a population is a major evolutionary pressure in sexual species ([Fis30, Wri69, Cha82, Bul83, KL86] and many others). <p> The third solution is essentially a combination of the previous two. Its existence in natural populations has not been explicitly demonstrated, although 21 there is considerable evidence of mixed ESD/genotypic systems which may conform to the structure <ref> [BVB82, NAG88a, LC93, CVE92, Jan92, WA94] </ref>. Whilst it is known [Ric86] that polygenic sex determination is unstable to invasion by mutants, we have demonstrated that in finite populations polygenic systems of sex determination are intrinsically unstable.

Reference-contexts: Necessarily, many of these studies have concentrated on sex determined by genotype at conception, although for many organisms there may be a selective advantage to determination of sex with respect to environmental cues <ref> [CB77, WC78, Cha82, BC88] </ref>. This advantage may arise whenever the environment is heterogenous in time or space and the relationship between environment quality and adult reproductive success differs between the two sexes.

Traditional analyses of these complex systems assume that linkage is low [Bar86], however other authors <ref> [Wri68] </ref> suggest that linkage between related genes may be very high. However there are some observations that we can make dependent on the relative speed of the underlying rates in the system: * Recombination very much slower than drift. In this case our system will behave as before. <p> The outcome is purely the result of two processes that affect factor frequencies in the gene pool. Random drift reduces genetic variability as a consequence of sampling error in finite populations <ref> [Wri68, Wri69] </ref>. Fisherian selection [Fis30] maintains only those combinations of factors that yield an unbiased population sex ratio; this latter process occurs as the rarer sex necessarily makes a relatively greater genetic contribution to the following generation. <p> Within our process algebraic description is a very general evolutionary system which could be exploited to investigate problems of evolution other than sex. The effects of linkage and finite population size in evolution are known to be very hard to understand <ref> [Wri68, Wri69] </ref>. The process algebraic approach may give new insights in this area. 7 Acknowledgements Chris Tofts is supported by an EPSRC Advanced Fellowship (B/93/AF/1556).
