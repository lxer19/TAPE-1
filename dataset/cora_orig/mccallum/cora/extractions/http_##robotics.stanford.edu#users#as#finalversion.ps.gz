Abstract: In radiosurgery, a moving beam of radiation acts as an ablative surgical instrument. Conventional systems for radiosurgery use a cylindrical radiation beam of fixed cross-section. The radiation source can only be moved along simple standardized paths. A new radiosurgical system based on a six degree-of-freedom robotic arm has been developed to overcome limitations of conventional systems. We address the following question: Can dose distributions generated by robotic radiosurgery be improved by using non-cylindrical radiation beams of adaptable cross-section? Geometric methods for planning the shape of the beam in addition to planning beam motion are developed. Design criteria considered in this context are: treatment time, radiation penumbra as well as transparency of interactive treatment planning. An experimental evaluation compares distributions generated with our new radiosurgical system using cylindrical beams to distributions generated with beams of adaptable shapes.

Reference-contexts: By combining cross-firing from multiple directions with precision targeting, the radiation beam acts as an ablative surgical instrument. A collimator, typically made of heavy metal is used for focusing and shaping the radiation beam. Conventional radiosurgical systems use static collimators producing cylindrical beams <ref> [5, 6, 8] </ref>. Cylindrical beams yield adequate distributions for spherical tumors. Our previous research has demonstrated that non-spherical dose distributions can be produced by moving a cylinder beam along appropriate paths. However, collimators of non-cylindrical shape are most natural for producing non-spherical dose distributions.

Reference-contexts: Given the flexibility of the new system, it is expected that radiosurgical procedures will replace conventional radiation methods as well as conventional surgery in many instances. 1.2 Related Research Nedzi, Kooy et al. <ref> [7] </ref> investigate characteristics of so-called single beam field-shaping paradigms.

Reference-contexts: Neurotron-1000 system in cooperation with Accuray, Inc., Santa Clara <ref> [10] </ref>. The Neurotron-1000 (N-1000) is a new radiosurgical system with the following features (fig. 2). The mechanical gantry is a GM-Fanuc robotic arm with 6 degrees of freedom, which allows for arbitrary spatial paths of the radiation beam. In contrast, conventional systems can only perform simple standardized motions. <p> Each field is then split into two sets; lines passing through C are separated from the remaining lines. After this, we compute the arrangement of beams thus obtained and apply the weighting method in <ref> [10] </ref> to assign weights to each (rectangular) beam. The user can change the delineation of C interactively to obtain distinct partitionings. Fig. 7. Collimator for N-1000 system; conic beam with rectangular cross-section. 3 Experiments The described methods were implemented in the context of the Neurotron-1000 system. <p> The malformation is delineated in the figures. The distribution generated with the described methods for a jaw collimator is shown in figs. 13-b through 15. The dose distribution generated by a cylinder collimator (in the same case) using the planning methods in <ref> [10] </ref> was computed for comparison. Fig. 14 shows the dose-volume histograms for jaw and cylinder collimators respectively. In both cases, integrals were computed and normalized to unit volume.
