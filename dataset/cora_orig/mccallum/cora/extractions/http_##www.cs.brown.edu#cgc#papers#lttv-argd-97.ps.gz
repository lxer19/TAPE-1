Abstract: In this paper we investigate the area requirement of proximity drawings and we prove an exponential lower bound. Our main contribution is to show the existence of a class of Gabriel-drawable graphs that require exponential area for any Gabriel drawing and any resolution rule. The result is further extended to an infinite class of proximity drawings.

Reference-contexts: Planar triangular graphs are a classical field of study in graph drawing, because of the many applications where such graphs arise (see, e.g. <ref> [6] </ref>). We extend the above result to weak Gabriel drawings. We show an exponential lower bound on the area of an infinite class of fi drawings, for 1 fi &lt; 1 1cos 2=5 . Some of the proofs are omitted in this extended abstract, because of page limits. 2 Preliminaries.
