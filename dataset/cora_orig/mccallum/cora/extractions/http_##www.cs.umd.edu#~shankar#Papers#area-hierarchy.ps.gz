Abstract: Traditional inter-domain routing protocols based on superdomains maintain either "strong" or "weak" ToS and policy constraints for each visible superdomain. With strong constraints, a valid path may not be found even though one exists. With weak constraints, an invalid domain-level path may be treated as a valid path. We present an inter-domain routing protocol based on superdomains, which always finds a valid path if one exists. Both strong and weak constraints are maintained for each visible superdomain. If the strong constraints of the superdomains on a path are satisfied, then the path is valid. If only the weak constraints are satisfied for some superdomains on the path, the source uses a query protocol to obtain a more detailed "internal" view of these superdomains, and searches again for a valid path. Our protocol handles topology changes, including node/link failures that partition superdomains. Evaluation results indicate our protocol scales well to large internetworks. fl This work is supported in part by ARPA and Philips Labs under contract DASG60-92-0055 to Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, and by National Science Foundation Grant No. NCR 89-04590.

Reference-contexts: Link-state algorithms can not be used with the landmark hierarchy, and a thorough study of enforcing ToS and policy constraints with this hierarchy has not been done. In <ref> [1] </ref>, we provided an alternative solution to loss of policy and ToS information that is perhaps more faithful to the original superdomain hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: To obtain internal views, we added for each visible superdomain U the edges from U to domains outside the parent of U . Surprisingly, this approach and the gateway-level view approach have the same memory and communication requirements. However, the first approach results in much more complicated protocols. Reference <ref> [2] </ref> presents interdomain routing protocols based on a new kind of hierarchy, referred to as the viewserver hierarchy. This approach also scales well to large internetworks and does not lose detail ToS and policy information. Here, special routers called viewservers maintain the view of domains in a surrounding precinct.

Reference-contexts: One drawback of our protocols is that to obtain a source route, views are merged at or prior to the connection setup, thereby increasing the setup time.

Second, the internal views of frequently queried superdomains can be cached at routers close to the source domain.

Reference-contexts: introduction. A query protocol for Nimrod is being developed to obtain more detailed policy, ToS and topology information. BGP <ref> [12] </ref> and IDRP [14] are based on a path-vector approach [15]. Here, for each destination domain a router maintains a set of paths, one through each of its neighbor routers. ToS and policy information is attached to these paths.

Reference-contexts: introduction. A query protocol for Nimrod is being developed to obtain more detailed policy, ToS and topology information. BGP [12] and IDRP <ref> [14] </ref> are based on a path-vector approach [15]. Here, for each destination domain a router maintains a set of paths, one through each of its neighbor routers. ToS and policy information is attached to these paths. <p> But to guarantee detection, either all possible paths should be exchanged (exponential number of paths in the worst case) or source policies should be made public and routers should take this into account when exchanging routes. However, this fix increases space and communication requirements drastically. IDRP <ref> [14] </ref> uses superdomains to solve the scaling problem. It exchanges all paths between neighbor routers subject to the following constraint: a router does not inform a neighbor router of a route if usage of the route by the neighbor would violate some superdomain's constraint on the route.

Reference-contexts: For each destination, a router exchanges its best valid path with its neighbor routers. However, a path-vector algorithm may not find a valid path from a source to the destination even 24 if such a route exists <ref> [16] </ref> 11 (i.e. detailed ToS and policy information may be lost). By exchanging k paths to each destination, the probability of detecting a valid path for each source can be increased. <p> One drawback of our protocols is that to obtain a source route, views are merged at or prior to the connection setup, thereby increasing the setup time. This drawback is not unique to our scheme <ref> [7, 16, 6, 9] </ref>. There are several ways to reduce this setup overhead. First, source routes to frequently used destinations can be cached. Second, the internal views of frequently queried superdomains can be cached at routers close to the source domain. <p> We also described an evaluation model for inter-domain routing protocols. This model can be applied to other inter-domain routing protocols. We have not done so because precise definitions of the hierarchies in these protocols are not available. For example, to do a fair evaluation of IDPR <ref> [16] </ref>, we need precise guidelines for how to group domains into superdomains, and how to choose between the strong and weak methods when defining policy/ToS constraints of superdomains. In fact, these protocols have not been evaluated in a way that we can compare them to the superdomain hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: This scheme does not scale up. In fact, it increases the storage requirement, since a router maintains a route for each destination address, and there are more addresses with this scheme. The landmark hierarchy <ref> [18, 17] </ref> is another approach for solving scaling problem. Here, each router is a landmark with a radius, and routers which are at most radius away from the landmark maintain a route for it.

Reference-contexts: This study does not address the scalability of the SDR mode. Ongoing work by this group considers a new SDR mode which is not based on IDPR. Reference <ref> [19] </ref> suggests the use of multiple addresses for each node, one for each ToS and Policy. This scheme does not scale up. In fact, it increases the storage requirement, since a router maintains a route for each destination address, and there are more addresses with this scheme.
