Abstract: Triangular B-splines surfaces are a tool for representing arbitrary piecewise polynomial surfaces over planar triangulations, while automatically maintaining continuity properties across patch boundaries. Recently, Alfeld et al. [1] introduced the concept of spherical barycentric coordinates which allowed them to formulate Bernstein-Bezier polynomials over the sphere. In this paper we use the concept of spherical barycentric coordinates to develop a similar formulation for triangular B-splines, which we call spherical triangular B-splines. These splines defined over spherical triangulations share the same continuity properties and similar evaluation algorithms with their planar counterparts, but possess none of the annoying degeneracies found when trying to represent closed surfaces using planar parametric surfaces. We also present an example showing the use of these splines for approximating spherical scattered data.

Reference-contexts: Similar algorithms for use over a spherical domain had, until this point, not been available, due to the inability to find a reasonable definition of barycentric coordinates on the sphere. In <ref> [1] </ref>, Alfeld et al. define a set of coordinates with properties similar to those of affine coordinates, but which do not sum to one. <p> Lastly, we present our conclusions and suggestions for further work. 2. Spherical Barycentric Coordinates and Spherical Bernstein Bezier Polynomials The notion of a spherical barycentric coordinate has recently been presented by Alfeld et al. <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Like conventional affine coordinates, spherical barycentric coordinates have a number of interesting properties that are natural extensions of the notion of an affine coordinate to the sphere. Consider the spherical triangle (v 0 ; v 1 ; v 2 ) and the a u on the sphere. Then <ref> [1] </ref>, * the spherical barycentric coordinates of u with respect to are exactly the same as the coordi nates of u in R 3 with respect to the basis v 0 ; v 1 ; v 2 . * if u has affine coordinates 0 ; 1 ; 2 ; origin

Reference-contexts: Many effective evaluation algorithms, such as the de Casteljau algorithm for Bernstein polynomials, or the de Boor algorithm for B-spline curves, are couched in terms of affine coordinates <ref> [2] </ref>. Similar algorithms for use over a spherical domain had, until this point, not been available, due to the inability to find a reasonable definition of barycentric coordinates on the sphere.

Reference-contexts: Using these spherical barycentric coordinates, they define a class of functions they call the spherical Bernstein-Bezier polynomials that can be evaluated using a de Casteljau-like algorithm for points on the sphere. One important class of piecewise polynomial surfaces is the triangular B-spline representation <ref> [3, 4, 5] </ref>. Their definition relies heavily on affine coordinates, and conventional triangular Bezier polynomial surfaces form a special case of these surfaces. Additionally, triangular B-spline surfaces also exhibit desirable continuity properties not available when formulating a spline surface, say, as a piecewise Bezier surface. <p> However, as in the planar case, continuity conditions between adjacent patches must be explicitly evaluated and maintained in order to ensure that a surface retains a particular degree of continuity, for example, when interactively manipulating coefficient values. Over planar triangulations, triangular B-spline surfaces <ref> [3, 4, 5] </ref>. have been used successfully to deal with this problem. Triangular B-spline surfaces can be used to represent any piecewise polynomial surface over a triangulation, while automatically maintaining continuity conditions between patches. <p> We simply use the fact the coefficients of the tetrahedral B-spline representation of P are the same as those of the spherical triangular B-spline representation. These coefficients can be obtained from the polar form p of P using the knots of a particular spherical patch as parameters (see <ref> [3, 10, 9] </ref>). Specifically, to find coordinate c ijk of spherical triangle (v 0 ; v 1 ; v 2 ), we evaluate c 3.3.
