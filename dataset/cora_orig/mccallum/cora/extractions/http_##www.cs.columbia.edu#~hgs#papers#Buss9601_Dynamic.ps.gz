Abstract: We describe a mechanism for dynamic adjustment of the bandwidth requirements of multimedia applications. The sending application uses RTP receiver reports to compute packet loss. Based on this metric the congestion state seen by the receivers is determined and the bandwidth is adjusted by a linear regulator with dead zone. The suggested mechanism has been implemented and controls the bandwidth of the vic video conferencing system. We ran several experiments on the Internet and on our local ATM network in order to tune and evaluate the algorithm. The results indicate that the mechanism can be applied to both environments. Since an ATM network has a different loss characteristic than the Internet different controller parameters must be set.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, while data services can change their rate instantaneously, continuous-media services have adaptation periods measured in tens of seconds to avoid abrupt and annoying changes in perceived quality. We can distinguish two kinds of in-call QoS adaptation: end-system initiated and network-initiated. End-system initiated applications <ref> [1] </ref> use signaling to request additional bandwidth (or release bandwidth) from the network when either the media characteristics or quality requirements change. Network-initiated control, the variety investigated here, bases the application target data rate on network feedback.

Reference-contexts: The probability of bit errors is very low on most networks, therefore we assume that loss is induced by congestion rather than by bit errors, just as it is done within TCP <ref> [4] </ref>. Buffer overflow can happen on a congested link or at the network interface of the workstation. To avoid losses at the network interface we used the workstations for the multimedia application exclusively. Our QoS feedback control scheme is depicted in figure 1. <p> In the case of congestion the application should rapidly reduce its bandwidth. Therefore we use a multiplicative decrease if we get a DECREASE message and an additive increase if the decision is INCREASE. If the decision is HOLD no changes take place. This well-known scheme is used in TCP <ref> [4] </ref> and ATM rate-control of ABR traffic [5]. It was also successfully applied in the context of application control by Bolot et al. [6].

As proposed therein we make sure that the bandwidth is always larger than a minimum bandwidth b min to guarantee a minimal quality of service at the receivers. A maximum bandwidth b max can also be set. <p> After that sequence it took approximately 100 seconds to increase the bandwidth again. It seems to be a better choice to compute the allowed bandwidth independently of the actual bandwidth. 5 Related Work A scalable feedback control mechanism for video sources has also been proposed in <ref> [6] </ref>. This mechanism is also end-to-end and defines network states according to feedback information from the receivers. This work differs from our approach in the sense that a probabilistic polling mechanism with increasing search scope and a randomly delayed reply scheme is used to supply the source with feedback information.

Reference-contexts: This parameter is manipulated by our control module. The chosen video encoding was nv <ref> [7] </ref>. The measurement scenario was as follows. Two video sources at GMD Fokus were sending two different previously recorded CNN news shows. This allowed us to use the same video sequence for each experiment.

Reference-contexts: With RTP the receiver reports are multicast periodically so that an explicit probing mechanism is not required. Another feedback controller is presented in <ref> [8] </ref>. However, this controller requires that the switches send their buffer occupancies and service rates back to the source. It was not designed to scale for multicast distributions.

Reference-contexts: However, this controller requires that the switches send their buffer occupancies and service rates back to the source. It was not designed to scale for multicast distributions. The control of the application by a network manager that monitors the network elements via standardized management infomation bases is presented in <ref> [9] </ref>. The network manager notifies applications of network congestion based on feedback received from switches and routers.

Reference-contexts: With the first solution the bulk of participants receive low-quality video. It is not clear which solution should be chosen in practice. A more powerful approach are video gateways or layered coding schemes as proposed in <ref> [10] </ref> to solve this problem. However, this affects both video encoding and switch design, issues we wanted to avoid in our approach to make it applicable in actual network environments.
