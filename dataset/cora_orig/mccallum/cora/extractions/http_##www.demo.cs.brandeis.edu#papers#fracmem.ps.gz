Title: Abstract  view that mental imagery is performed in an analogue, pictorial medium began to regain accep  
Note: The Imagery Debate This latter  
Abstract: This paper 1 proposes a new approach to mental imagery that has the potential for resolving an old debate. We show that the methods by which fractals emerge from dynamical systems provide a natural computational framework for the relationship between the deep representations of long-term visual memory and the surface representations of the visual array, a distinction which was proposed by (Kosslyn, 1980). The concept of an iterated function system (IFS) as a highly compressed representation for a complex topological set of points in a metric space (Barnsley, 1988) is embedded in a connectionist model for mental imagery tasks. Two advantages of this approach over previous models are the capability for topological transformations of the images, and the continuity of the deep representations with respect to the surface representations. The phenomena of mental imagery is widely disputed among cognitive scientists primarily because it occupies a position in the boundary between perception and cognition. On the one hand, mental images seem to be purely symbolic structural descriptions that are independent of any perceptual mechanisms. In this way images are no different from any other knowledge structures and therefore require no special purpose mechanisms, but can be reasoned about and operated on in the traditional propositional fashion. On the other hand, mental images seem to be represented by a special-purpose cognitive architecture that shares components with the visual perceptual system. Under this approach, additional mechanisms must be proposed for inspecting, transforming, and reasoning about images, providing a means for translating between purely symbolic representations and the visual buffer.

In this approach, the pointer referred to in the above quote would be a single point in a multi-dimensional space of IFS parameters.

Reference-contexts: As an example of the former, an experiment designed by Lee Brooks <ref> (Brooks, 1968) </ref>, required subjects to imagine a block letter and report whether successive corners were at the extreme top or bottom of the letter. <p> The experiment showed that visually oriented responses (i.e., pointing to the letters Y or N) took longer than verbal responses (saying yes or no) implying that the visual response task was interfering with the imagery task. In a similar experiment <ref> (also Brooks, 1968) </ref>, he asked the subjects to report whether successive words in a sentence were nouns. In this case, verbal responses were slower than visually oriented responses. Brooks conclusion was that mental imagery is distinct from verbal processes, and shares processing resources with the visual perceptual system.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, a large training set imposes too many simultaneous constraints when using epoch learning. To balance these considerations, the network was only trained on a small subset of the entire training set during each epoch, similar to the independent method of <ref> (Cottrell & Tsung, 1991) </ref>. In order to solve the bias problem, a new subset was randomly chosen at increasing intervals.

Reference-contexts: To provide an example of the error that Pylyshyn perceives in the analogue viewpoint, he briey discusses 2 the scanning experiments Kosslyn performed with his colleagues in the 1970s <ref> (see Kosslyn, 1980) </ref>. The results of these experiments showed that the further away from the current point of focus in an image a target object was, the longer it took to refocus on the target. Pylyshyn admits that this is clear evidence that inter-object distances are represented in mental images.

Reference-contexts: information about what an object looked like, without any reference to coordinate spaces, but Kosslyn has been unable to formulate an appropriate representation and medium that is relevant to the theory: We have not as yet made any strong claims about the precise format of the underlying lit eral encodings. <ref> (Kosslyn, 1981) </ref> The propositional encodings are simply assertions used to describe the properties and features of an object, which presumably can be manipulated by mechanized logic. These representations are governed by syntax driven rules for interpretation and manipulation that are independent of the semantics of their values.

By increasing the number of snapshotsby reducing the grainsize of a discrete interpolationit is possible to produce an animation of the deformation process.

Reference-contexts: term analogue. whether certain aspects of cognition, generally (though not exclusively) associated with imagery, ought to be viewed as governed by tacit knowledgeor whether they should be viewed as intrinsic properties of certain representational media or of certain mechanisms that are not alterable in nomologically arbitrary ways by tacit knowledge. <ref> (Pylyshyn, 1981) </ref> In order to substantiate his feeling that the answer to the first question is no, Pylyshyn attacks the analogue position on two fronts. The first attack consists of several specific criticisms of the Kosslyn model. <p> The crux of the failure of Kosslyns model, as he sees it is expressed in the following quote from <ref> (Pylyshyn, 1981) </ref>: Cognitive principles such as those invoked by [Kosslyn] would only be theoretically substantive (i.e., explanatory) if they specified (a) how it was possible to have formal operations that had the desired semantic generalization as their consequencethat is, how one could arrange a formal representation and operations upon it so

When presented with pairs of drawings of three dimensional shapes at differing orientations that were either identical or mirror images, the subjects were to report whether the objects had the same shape, independent of any difference in orientation.
