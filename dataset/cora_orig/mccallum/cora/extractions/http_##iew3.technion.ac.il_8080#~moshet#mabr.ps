Reference-contexts: Naturally, not all belief revision operators are satisfactory. A satisfactory (single agent) belief revision operator is assumed to obey the AGM postulates <ref> [AGM85, Gar88] </ref>. These postulates aim to capture stability properties, eliminating unnecessary perturbations to the database. For example, one of these postulates states that if a new acquired observation is consistent with the agent's beliefs, then the agent's new belief is obtained by adding the new observation to the current beliefs.

Last but not least our work heavily relies on the strong foundations supplied by theories of single-agent belief revision [Gar88, KM91, FH94, dS92, GM88, Bou92, Gro88], which enable us to treat the single-agent revision process as a building block for the multi-agent case.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we should require social rationality about the way R new s is built given R I;S I;S 2 . Requirements for social rationality can be found in the social choice literature <ref> [LR57, Arr63] </ref>. These requirements were already used in the AI literature in a somewhat similar context [DW89]. We will adopt the following basic social rationality requirements. <p> The above theorem implies that given two individual rankings over the shared domain in Step 2:1 , a mapping satisfying our requirements would output one of these rankings as R new s . This result is mainly an implication of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem <ref> [Arr63] </ref>. Notice that the process we consider consists of a sequence of iterations, where in each iteration a multi-agent belief revision operator is applied. <p> In order to satisfy requirement 2, R new s should be a joint ranking over the possible assignments to 1 " 2 . Requirements 4-6 coincide with the conditions of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem <ref> [Arr63] </ref>. In Arrow's setting, one wishes to generate a joint ranking from a set of individual rankings in a way that will be general, (weak) pareto-optimal, and independent of irrelevant alternatives.

Reference-contexts: Then, the process should prefer to choose R new1 s rather than R new2 s . Requirement 9 captures the need to be as cautious as possible in ignoring some of the possible assignments, which is a typical assumption in non-monotonic reasoning and belief ascription contexts <ref> [BT94] </ref>. Although this requirement is natural in many domains, one can consider situations in which this requirement is not essential for defining satisfactory multi-agent belief revision operators.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Consider an agent, a set of beliefs it adopts, and a new observation it makes. Taking the new observation as a fact that should be incorporated to its beliefs, the agent may need to revise its beliefs. Belief revision is a basic research topic in AI <ref> [Gar88, KM91, FH94, dS92, Gro88, Doy91] </ref>, and research on the theory of belief revision seems to converge to a well-established theory [Gar92]. Most of the theory developed in this area has concentrated on systems consisting of a single agent. <p> We mentioned some related work in the body of this paper. We should emphasize that our work has been inspired by and is complementary to several lines of research. First, it is related to work on applying choice theory to the AI context <ref> [DW89, Doy91] </ref>. Second, it is related to work on the general theory of multi-agent belief revision for uncoordinated 7 agents [vdM94, Gal92, Gas91] , and to the study of algorithmic aspects of multi-agent belief revision [HB91].

Reference-contexts: This paper initiates research on multi-agent belief revision in heterogeneous systems, where each agent may have its own perspective of the world but the agents need to coordinate (i.e., agree on) their beliefs on shared elements. Unfortunately, excluding some work on algorithmic aspects of multi-agent belief revision <ref> [HB91] </ref>, no work has addressed this general heterogeneous multi-agent belief revision process. However, the latter is crucial for many applications, such as in the context of distributed databases. <p> First, it is related to work on applying choice theory to the AI context [DW89, Doy91].

Reference-contexts: Our main question is: what would be the structure of a belief revision process in a multi-agent setting? 3 Our results can be extended to some n-party settings, where n &gt; 2. We will return to this point in Section 6. This point is discussed in detail in <ref> [KD96] </ref>. 4 Similar settings can be defined for the case where agents may have simultaneous observations, or observations about a mixture of private and shared propositions. Although the belief revision operators which the agents use may be defined for these cases as well, our multi-agent setting assumes the above-mentioned restrictions. <p> This point is further discussed in <ref> [KD96] </ref> and in the full paper. We will return to this point at Section 6 Requirement 2: The output of Step 2:1 is a joint ranking over the possible assignments to 1 " 2 .
