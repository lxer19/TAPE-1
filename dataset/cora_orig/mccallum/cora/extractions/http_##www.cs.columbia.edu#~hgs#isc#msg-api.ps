Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The control of multimedia conferencing, covering, among others, the distribution of state information, floor control, voting, membership, have been discussed in a number of papers; a range of proposals have been implemented, ranging from highly structured traditional multimedia systems such as MMC and JVTOS <ref> [1] </ref> to loosely coupled systems such as the Internet multicast tools (MBONE tools). For a number of applications, more elaborate control is desirable: Controller (s) to media agent: Note that a single conference may have multiple controllers.

Reference-contexts: However, for a single user, at most one application is currently responsible for each media session within a conference, as explained in Section 3.1. The idea of subscribing to events is also found in <ref> [2] </ref>, albeit for mediating access to shared hypermedia objects within a single system. A file-system event registration service called file-activity monitor (FAM) is offered within the Silicon Graphics Irix operating system. Mark Handley's and Ian Wakeman's work on naming components is also reflected in the message formats [3].

This approach could also be considered as a status-based system, as used for control networks [4]. The architecture is receiver-oriented, with a similar behavior as found in IP multicast: the sender does not know or care who receives its messages, rather, receivers express interest in particular kinds of messages.

Reference-contexts: However, instead of a rigid set of IP multicast addresses, the receiver-directed filter allows a dynamic and fine-grained control over which messages reach a receiver. Receiver-directed filters are also central to the RSVP resource reservation protocol <ref> [5] </ref>. The system presented here uses constants and information provided by the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) [6] and the audio/video profile of that protocol [7].

Reference-contexts: Receiver-directed filters are also central to the RSVP resource reservation protocol [5]. The system presented here uses constants and information provided by the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) <ref> [6] </ref> and the audio/video profile of that protocol [7]. In that protocol, each member of a session periodically announces itself by transmitting RTP control (RTCP) packets containing a globally unique name, other business-card information and statistics about received sites. <p> (UDP) C ! M : sessionname transport application protocol (RTP) C ! M : sessionname key encryption key C ! M : sessionname port port number C ! M : sessionname ttl ttl value C ! M : sessionname encrypt boolean C ! M : sessionname priority net The RTP <ref> [6] </ref> source description (SDES) parameters (cname, name, email, phone, txt, loc) determine the information sent periodically for the local site. The ttl (time-to-live) value is only needed for multicast and ignored otherwise. The encryption key key is used for secure communication.

Reference-contexts: However, the architecture does not depend on the use of RTP/RTCP. 3 Message Format All messages are sent as ASCII text and are interpretable by, for example, a Tcl <ref> [8] </ref> interpreter. Parameters containing spaces are enclosed in braces. In the examples, we prefix the message with C ! M to indicate Schulzrinne Expires 5/1/96 [Page 3] INTERNET-DRAFT draft-ietf-mmusic-.ps January 11, 1996 messages from controller to media agent (s) and with M ! C for the opposite direction.
