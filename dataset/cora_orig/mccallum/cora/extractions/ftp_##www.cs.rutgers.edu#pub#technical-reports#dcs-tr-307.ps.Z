Abstract: The rapid advances in computer and communication technologies, and their merger, is leading to a global information market place. It will consist of federations of very large number of information systems that will cooperate to varying extents to support the users' information needs. We propose an architecture which may facilitate meeting these needs. It consists of three main components: information providers, information brokers and information consumers. We also propose an approach to information brokering. We discuss two of it's tasks: inf ormation resource discovery, which identifies relevant information sources for a given query, and query processing, which involves the generation of appropriate mapping from relevant but structurally heterogeneous objects. Query processing consists of inf ormation f ocusing and inf ormation correlation. While the access-based search, and syntactic and hierarchical information organization has been adequate in the past, information brokering in presence of huge digital libraries or millions of information sources will likely require semantics and information-content based search and structuring of information. Our approach is based on: semantic proximity, which represents semantic similarities based on the context of comparison, and schema correspondences which are used to represent structural mappings and are associated with the context. The context of comparison of the two objects is the primary vehicle to represent the semantics for determining semantic proximity. Specifically, we use a context to capture the semantics in terms of the meaning and/or the use of an object. Using a partial context representation, we capture the assumptions in the intended use of the objects and the intended meaning of the user query. Information focusing is supported by subsequent context comparison. The same mechanism can be used to support information resource discovery. Context comparison leads to changes in schema correspondences that are used to support information correlation.

Reference-contexts: Another approach has been to exploit the semantics of a single problem domain (viz. transportation planning) <ref> [ACHK93] </ref>. The domain model is a declarative description of the objects and activities possible in the application domain as viewed by a typical user. The user formulates queries using terms from the application domain. In our opinion both the above attempts are lacking in scalability of their approaches.

Reference-contexts: It returns information such as the user's address and e-mail address. A "partly semantic" approach is based on classifying the information in a hierarchical manner and by using attribute based searches. The World Wide Web <ref> [BL + 92] </ref> has three discovery trees which classify information according to subject, server type and organization. It merges information discovery and hypertext techniques. In Nomenclator [OM93], attribute-based naming is implemented on top of other naming systems.

Reference-contexts: The query context defined in Section 3.3.2 reflects this perspective. One view suggested in AI is that one memory schema refers to another only through the use of a description which is dependent on the context of the original reference <ref> [BN75] </ref>. In the area of linguistics and cognitive psychology, experiments have borne out a strong relationship between semantic similarity and contextual similarity [MC91].

Reference-contexts: Whether the attributes are equivalent or not would then be determined by the context in which they are being compared. In linguistics [Woo85], the interest in semantics has focused on characterizing the different meanings of the same sentence. A knowledge engineer <ref> [BW85] </ref>, on the other hand, is usually interested in a (semantic) description that represents partial knowledge about an entity and accommodates multiple descriptions of the entity from different viewpoints.

Reference-contexts: In the Archie project [ED92], files are currently located by their names. Names and descriptions of software packages and documents are also stored. Entries can also be text strings consisting of keywords and associated descriptions. In the X.500 directory service <ref> [CCI91] </ref>, entities in the directory are represented by entries in a global, hierarchical name space called the Directory Information Tree (DIT) according to the structural relationships between the classes of information they represent. <p> We believe that our approach would add significant value to the text based and partly semantic approaches enumerated above. The advantages of our approach can be summarized as follows: * The approach followed in X.500 <ref> [CCI91] </ref>, Gopher [McC92], Nomenclator [OM93] and CORBA [OMG93] is based on the structure of the objects. The structure of an object, however is inadequate to represent the information content of an object. <p> We believe that a structure based on the semantic content of the document would be of a much smaller size. * In X.500 <ref> [CCI91] </ref> the information is organized in a hierarchical manner. This approach would not scale well because it would be inefficient to search this hierarchy based criteria other than the ones used to develop it.

We consider these approaches as a variant of the basic approach where context is represented as a collection of meta-attributes.

We plan to represent the contents of the information sources and the query of the user by constructing contexts which capture their semantics. The contexts are constructed from the domain ontologies which may be known or available to the user.

In constructing the contexts as illustrated in Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2, the choice of the contextual coordinates and the values assigned to them is very important. There should be ontological commitments, i.e. agreements about the ontological objects used between the users and the information system designers.

Reference-contexts: We adapt the mechanism of context comparison to propose an approach to information resource discovery. 5.1 Previous Approaches A common text retrieval approach used in resource discovery on the internet is primarily based on text search of the contents of the documents. In the WAIS project <ref> [KM91] </ref>, database servers keep complete inverted indices on stored document contents and execute full text searches on them. In the Archie project [ED92], files are currently located by their names.

Our approach incorporates the semantics of the object in an attempt to capture the information content. * In the WAIS project <ref> [KM91] </ref> a complete inverted index of the text of all the documents is stored. This approach, however would not scale well in the infocosm consisting of millions of information sources.

Reference-contexts: If O i models objects at the attribute level, then attr (O i ) is an empty set. is a mapping (first order or second order) expressing the correspondences between objects, their attributes and the values of the objects/attributes. The concept of dynamic attributes has been proposed in <ref> [LA86] </ref> to specify the mappings between different attributes. Various ways of implementing the mappings are proposed (viz. mathematical formulae, tables, programs). However, we here focus on the specification of mappings at a conceptual level between the domains of attributes and objects.

Reference-contexts: Other than the ontological commitment, a critical issue in designing ontologies is the scalability of the the ontology as more information sources enter the federation. * The Common Ontology approach: One approach has been to build an extensive global ontology. A notable example of global ontology is Cyc <ref> [LG90] </ref> consisting of around 30,000 objects. In Cyc, the mapping between each individual information resource and global 24 ontology is accomplished by a set of articulation axioms which are used to map the entities of an information resource to the concepts (viz. frames, slots) in Cyc's existing ontology.

Reference-contexts: In the area of linguistics and cognitive psychology, experiments have borne out a strong relationship between semantic similarity and contextual similarity <ref> [MC91] </ref>. This has led to the belief that semantic similarity is a function of the contexts in which an object is used and that the contextual representation of an object is the knowledge of how that object is used. <p> The contextual representation is visualized as an abstract cognitive structure that accumulates the attributes common to all the contexts in which an object is used <ref> [MC91] </ref>. We propose that context can be used as a tool for characterizing the intended usage of the objects.

Reference-contexts: In the following examples, we use the representation of context defined above to make those assumptions explicit. This approach is similar to the assuming (p,c) predicate in <ref> [McC93] </ref> where one can view the context as a collection of assumptions. With each object O defined, we associate the definition context C def (O) which makes explicit the assumptions behind the definition of that entity O. <p> Otherwise the C res (Query, InformationSource) identifies the information source as being relevant to the query. This approach may be considered as one way of achieving transcendence. In <ref> [McC93] </ref>, transcendence is defined as the ability to move a proposition from one context to another which relaxes or changes some assumptions of the old context.

Reference-contexts: Wood [Woo85] defines semantics to be "the scientific study of the relations between signs and symbols and what they denote or mean." It is not possible to completely define what an object denotes or means in the model world <ref> [SG89] </ref>. Another perspective of semantics is the different ways signs and symbols are used. We believe that, in general it is not possible to completely enumerate the different ways an object might be used in the model world.

Reference-contexts: These developments have helped create an environment where one can have access to "any information anywhere you want in (m)any form (s)". We envision the emergence of an infocosm in this environment (a twist on George Gilder's "telecosm <ref> [tel93] </ref>), which we define to mean a society with ubiquitous access/exchange of tradeable information in all electronic forms. In this future society, two major classes of applications and services will likely emerge, viz. mass market applications and information content sensitive applications.

Reference-contexts: In a multidatabase environment, the contents of a database can be meaningful in a given context and the meaning/significance can be looked at in terms of an interpretation in the context <ref> [Tho89] </ref>. We observe a commonality in diverse fields of research when it comes to representing the meaning of an object which is that the same sentence/entity can have different meanings/descriptions. We propose that in either case, it is the context which 9 determines the applicable meaning/descriptor/assumption.

Reference-contexts: These objects may model information at an attribute level or an entity level. Wood <ref> [Woo85] </ref> defines semantics to be "the scientific study of the relations between signs and symbols and what they denote or mean." It is not possible to completely define what an object denotes or means in the model world [SG89]. <p> We propose that this can be done by defining the mappings between the domains of the two objects with respect to a context. Whether the attributes are equivalent or not would then be determined by the context in which they are being compared. In linguistics <ref> [Woo85] </ref>, the interest in semantics has focused on characterizing the different meanings of the same sentence. A knowledge engineer [BW85], on the other hand, is usually interested in a (semantic) description that represents partial knowledge about an entity and accommodates multiple descriptions of the entity from different viewpoints.
