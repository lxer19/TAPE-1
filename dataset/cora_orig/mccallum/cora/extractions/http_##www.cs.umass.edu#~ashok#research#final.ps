The effective action concept has also found applications in Adler's induced gravity approach to quantum gravity [4] (See also [5] in this connection). A feature of the conventional definition of the effective action is that it is gauge dependent off the mass-shell.

Reference-contexts: The problem of convexity relates to the fact that whereas the exact effective potential is convex <ref> [10] </ref>, which means that even for a theory with symmetry breaking at the classical level the exact effective potential can never have a double well shape , its perturbative expansion is however, neither convex nor real.

Reference-contexts: This leads to an unsatisfactory situation as the exact and the perturbatively expanded effective potential show different behaviour. The convexity problem has been treated by several authors, including O`Raifeartaigh et al <ref> [11] </ref> and Stevenson [12], the latter using the Gaussian effective potential approach, and more recently, by Balakrishnan & Moss [13] who applied their formalism to the standard electroweak theory at high temperatures.

Reference-contexts: In 2 + 1 dimensions, in flat spacetime, several interesting phenomena, such as the quantum Hall effect and high temperature superconductivity, all involving planar gauge theoretic dynamics have been studied.

In curved 2 + 1 dimensional spacetime, Einstein's theory of gravitation exhibits several unexpected features [15,16]. <p> We have thus been able to show that the original 6 theory is regained at least to a first approximation, i.e., if the contributions from the integral which are next to leading order in 1=N are ignored. We shall now consider symmetry breaking.

Since we have considered a gauged 6 theory, our result (35) also contains the vector contributions to the B.Ashok & J.Balakrishnan J.Phys.A ,31,3999-4011 ( 1998). 16 effective potential.

Reference-contexts: Standard calculations of the effective potential making an expansion about only one saddle point suffer from the drawback that the naive loop expansion fails in the case of theories with broken symmetry. In a series of papers, Bender, Cooper,Guralnik and others <ref> [17] </ref> developed a mean field theory approximation method for performing perturbative calculations leading to a well-defined loop expansion for broken symmetric theories. Their idea, essentially, is to introduce an auxiliary composite field and to rewrite the classical La-grangian using the auxiliary field. <p> Following the mean field approach of Bender, Cooper and Guralnik <ref> [17] </ref>, we introduce an auxiliary composite field (x) coupled to another external source K (x). <p> It was explained in <ref> [17] </ref> for 6 theory that the limit N ! 1 corresponds to the limit * ! 0.

The field redefinition <ref> [18] </ref> : A (x) = B (x) e which some authors refer to as the "unitary gauge choice", then eliminates the (x) field appearing in the resulting action and reduces the gauge theory to a non-gauge theory : S = dv x f 4 1 (2 + m 2 + e

Reference-contexts: The integral contributes to the next order in the *h expansion. The effective action defined in (6) bears a slight resemblance to that defined by Cornwall, Jackiw and Tomboulis <ref> [19] </ref> for composite fields, but in fact differs from it, and so do the field equations (9) following from it.

Reference-contexts: It can be shown that different parametrizations for the fields lead to different results for the effective action if sufficient care is not taken. A lucid account of this has been given by Toms <ref> [20] </ref>. We will now briefly go over the essence of the Vilkovisky-DeWitt (V-D) procedure before using it in our calculations. We use DeWitt's condensed notation [21] here. <p> Further, all the ordinary derivatives are replaced by covariant derivatives. We work only to one-loop order, and to this order, Vilkovisky's definition of the effective action coincides with DeWitt's <ref> [20] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It is seen that the components of the field-space metric are given by : g (x)(x 0 ) = ffi (x; x 0 ) ; g (x)(x 0 ) = 2 (x)ffi (x; x 0 ) The uncondensed notation used here is that followed by Kunstatter <ref> [24] </ref>. Since the field is gauge-invariant, it does not contribute at all either to the field space or to the orbit space connections.

Reference-contexts: In these situations, terms containing derivatives of the scalar field and of the field (for instance in the f (n) terms) would become important, particularly if the background spacetime is non-trivial.
