Title: A Comparison of Real and Simulated Designs for Vibratory Parts Feeding  
Author: Dina R. Berkowitz John Canny

Abstract: The design of industrial parts feeders is a long, trial-and- error process that can take months even for the design of feeders that orient only one type of part. This paper describes the use of dynamic simulation to expedite the design and prototyping of parts feeders. We give probabilistic descriptions of vibratory parts feeding behavior, and we present a comparison between simulated design experiments and physical experiments done using a real industrial vibratory bowl feeder. Our findings show strong similarities between the results of the two types of experiments. We believe that dynamic simulation is a promising approach for expediting the parts feeder analysis and design process.

Reference-contexts: We would like to use dynamic simulation to expedite the efficient and effective design of industrial parts feeders. In our previous work, we described a tool to automatically generate, perform, and evaluate suites of feeder design experiments using dynamic simulation <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> . In that work and here we used Mirtich's impulse-based dynamic simulator, Impulse [ 11; 12 ] . Impulse uses a friction-based model to simulate the micro- collisions occurring between impacting bodies. <p> Their work was seminal in examining geometrical and physical considerations of the feeder design problem [ 3; 14 ] . The tool we developed previously, enables us to automatically generate and perform many experiments over a parameterized multidimensional space of potential designs <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> . In a similar manner, Brost parameterized an operation space of grasping motions for producing a desired outcome. His algorithm incorporated uncertainty to guarantee successful operations. He implemented and tested his planner successfully using a real manipulator [ 5 ] .

Simulating each gate with our tool independently allows us to compute the probability for each pre- and post-orientation of the gate that one will be converted into the other. <p> We use our tool to compute the probability that a part in a particular initial orientation will end up in each final orientation as it passes through a gate. We thus use our simulation results from Impulse to generate Boothroyd's stochastic matrices <ref> [ 14 ] </ref> . We can also attach the gate probabilities derived from our experimentation to the edges or state transitions of the NFA. Both Boothroyd's model and the NFA model allow us to compute transition probabilities for the entire feeder. feeder.
