Title: Design of Real-time Admission Control Algorithms with Priority Support

Abstract: A multimedia ATM network is shared by media channels with different performance requirements and traffic characteristics. To make efficient use of network resources, the quality of service provided to the users should be as close as possible to their requirements. In this paper a scheme with two levels of cell loss priority within each channel is proposed. Priorities are assigned and enforced by the network locally at each switch along the path of a connection. The assignment, which can be different for the same connection at two different switches, is also dynamic; it is updated every time a connection is set up or one is terminated. Algorithms used by the network to decide the fraction of cells of each stream assigned to each cell loss priority level, along with a simple mechanism to enforce the desired priority assignment and a real-time admission control algorithm, with decision time of very few milliseconds even for thousands of heterogeneous sources are presented.

Reference-contexts: An approach overcoming these limitations by assigning some of the cells of a connection to high priority and the rest to low priority is presented in <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Two general methods of priority assignment to channels can be distinguished. The first assigns multiple priorities within the same channel by assigning a fraction of the cells of each channel to each of the priority levels (eg. <ref> [1] </ref>). An important design issue in this case is the way in which the fractions to be mapped to each priority level are decided. The second method assigns the whole channel to a single priority level (eg. [8]).

Reference-contexts: An obvious disadvantage is that all the channels within the same priority level are treated uniformly, independent of their loss requirements. Schemes with up to hundreds of priority levels are feasible in terms of hardware support, as can be seen from <ref> [2] </ref>. In the extreme case, one channel can be assigned to each priority level. The solution of assigning a fraction of the cells of each channel to each priority level, is adopted in this paper.

Reference-contexts: Continuous media have stringent delay jitter requirements. Finally, some applications require loss-free transmission. In <ref> [3] </ref> a complete traffic management scheme for multimedia ATM networks is introduced. It supports four different classes of traffic, with different performance requirements expressed in terms of delay and loss guarantees (Table 1). <p> It supports four different classes of traffic, with different performance requirements expressed in terms of delay and loss guarantees (Table 1).

The approach proposed in [3], along with all networks that do not exercise any explicit control over loss of information due to congestion, cannot adjust the loss probability provided to each channel according to its quality of service (QoS) requirements. <p> All of these aspects make the work presented in this paper distinct and a contender for implementation in real networks, especially in conjunction with the work presented in <ref> [3] </ref>. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of related work. Section 3 discusses possible solutions supporting priorities. Section 4 presents the proposed scheme, and Section 5 presents the CAC algorithm for this scheme. Section 6 evaluates the performance of the proposed scheme.

Reference-contexts: For the purposes of the CAC algorithm, the number of cells of a channel within a frame have to be specified. With probability p i specified in <ref> [4] </ref>, the channel is idle, in which case it contributes zero cells within a frame. With probability p i = 1 p i the channel is active. <p> In this case a mapping from the peak rate of the channel to the number of cells that the channel can send to the network per frame has to be performed. The details of this mapping are presented in <ref> [4] </ref>. Notice that when transforming from peak rate to cells per frame, the result can be a non-integer number of cells per frame. <p> Similarly for the other parameters in the above description. From now on, the comma between the two subscripts will be omitted. All the above mentioned parameters are explicitly calculated in <ref> [4] </ref>. 5 CAC Algorithm HP cells have preemptive priority over LP cells. The CAC algorithm calculates the loss probability provided to each channel, in an environment consisting of heterogeneous sources. <p> L i P L i + H i P L i C m;j = P robfm HP cells and j LP cells in a frameg The equations for updating the C m;j coefficients when a new channel i is added or when channel i is removed, can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. Let R l = number of cells per frame Observe that since the cell loss probability must be kept low in order to accept a new connection, the C m;j coefficients must decrease rapidly as m and j increase. <p> robftotal number of cells of all active channels per frameg = k ferent traffic characteristics Also, let: S j = i=j S j = i=j i ~ C j ; and ~ S = m= R l Performing some approximations and some algebraic ma nipulations which can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>, the loss probability for the high and the low priority cells is given by: P L i = p ` i (p `` i G (r `` i ) + p `h i G (r `h i )) + HP HP HP HP and LP LP LP LP LP p <p> Even in the worst case, which appears in the top two graphs of Figure 6, the overestimation never exceeds an order of magnitude. Computational Complexity The computational complexity of the above algorithm is is evaluated in <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, admission control is based on pre-computed look-up tables under the assumption of homogeneous channels. Another approach to providing different kinds of service to channels with different requirements is through the use of priorities. In <ref> [5] </ref>, the usefulness of priorities is demonstrated through simulation studies for a scheme supporting two different QoS classes corresponding to different loss requirements. In [8] each channel is assigned either a high or a low priority. Traffic estimators are used to estimate the high priority traffic characteristics.

Reference-contexts: The situation corresponding to this example is depicted in Figure 1. 2 4.3 Framing Strategy In order to preserve the traffic characteristics of the channels throughout the network and provide a constant delay and a strictly bounded jitter to all cells, an extension of the framing strategy proposed in <ref> [6] </ref>, will be used. The framing strategy proposed in [6] divides time into equal intervals called frames and denoted by T . Each source can transmit at most up to an agreed amount of information within each frame. <p> in Figure 1. 2 4.3 Framing Strategy In order to preserve the traffic characteristics of the channels throughout the network and provide a constant delay and a strictly bounded jitter to all cells, an extension of the framing strategy proposed in <ref> [6] </ref>, will be used.

There are two potential drawbacks in the framing strategy proposed in <ref> [6] </ref> associated with the efficient use of network resources. First it performs a peak rate allocation, leading to poor utilization of the available resources. Second, the framing introduces a discretization of the possible rates of operation of a source.

Reference-contexts: When a new channel requests connection, then the channel is mapped to the class which is closer to the service requirements of the channel. In <ref> [7] </ref> such a scheme with three different traffic classes is proposed. The admission in this scheme can be performed based on pre-computed look-up tables of the admission regions, under the assumption of homogeneous channels within each class.
