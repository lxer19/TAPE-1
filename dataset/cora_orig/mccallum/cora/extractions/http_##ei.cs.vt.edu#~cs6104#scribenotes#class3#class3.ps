Abstract: Algebraic structures such as groups, rings, and fields are useful to the study of number theory. Both groups and rings are reviewed covering material from Sections 2.8.1 through 2.8.2 in [1]. The topic of fields is left for the next class meeting.

Reference-contexts: Infinite cyclic groups are isomorphic (denoted by ~ = , see Section 2.8.1 in <ref> [1] </ref> for a definition) to (Z; +) and have the property that g i 6= g j for all integers i 6= j and no positive power of g is equal to 1.
