Title: A Simplified Model of a Supercritical Power Plant  
Author: Wataro Shinohara Daniel E. Koditschek 
Date: September, 1995  
Pubnum: Technical Report  
Abstract: We develop a simplified state-space model of a once-through su-percritical boiler turbine power plant. This phenomenological model has been developed to facilitate analytical insight in support of our investigation of wide load cycling operations including startup and shut down. We compare our model to several more physically accurate (and far more complicated) models and provide as well some contrasting simulation results.

Reference-contexts: Our goal is a simple, physically based dynamic model suitable for intelligent nonlinear controller design. Various past legislative and economic constraints have imposed increasingly stringent requirements on plant operations necessitating increasingly reliable performance for ever wider operating ranges <ref> [1] </ref>. Retooling power plants to meet these requirements has been accompanied by the development of numerous research and engineering efforts to build rigorous models for boiler turbine operation over the last three decades.

Reference-contexts: On one hand, there is a great amount of work stressing physical accuracy with the goal of developing numerical simulations | for example, static and dynamic finite element methods <ref> [2] </ref> | as a representation of the complex constituent physical phenomena that characterize the energy conversion process. Such simulation models are extremely valuable, and we will rely on one in particular, the EPRI sponsored operators' training package [15], mentioned above, to validate our own work. <p> But these complex numerical models cannot be used to gain insight into the nature of the plant dynamics such as would be required for intelligent controller design. In contrast, the prevailing industrial controllers typically consist of numerous PID loops <ref> [2, 9, 15] </ref> tuned in a more or less centralized manner to reflect plant engineers' intuition regarding the right settings for different operating regimes. <p> Q gwf ,Q gws are composed of exclusively radiation heat transfer ( <ref> [2] </ref> Chap.4,4-7,8) and convection heat transfer term respectively. They are as follows.

Reference-contexts: Under supercritical conditions, water changes uniformly into steam without boiling, promoting a "once-through" type steam generator configuration. It is generally acknowledged that the supercritical once through boiler offers increased efficiency <ref> [3] </ref> and presents greater opportunities for an "agile" response to changing load demand. By the same token, its behavior near the critical range is rather complicated and characterised by strongly nonlinear dynamics.
