Abstract: We develop a mathematical model for the coating of ceramic fibers by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in cylindrical hot- or cold-walled reactors. The model couples the Navier-Stokes equations for the mixture of a carrier gas and precursor species, an energy equation for the gaseous mixture, a convection-diffusion system for the reacting precursor species, a fiber coating model, and a fiber heat conduction equation. The system is heated by a combination of conduction, convection, and radiation. The partial differential system resulting from this model is solved by adaptive finite element software using automatic mesh refinement and coarsening on a quadtree-structured mesh. The results of parameter studies indicate the effectiveness of using adaptive solution techniques with CVD applications and also suggest some guidance for improving the process.

Reference-contexts: The resulting differential model of the CVD coating process is solved by adaptive finite element software (Section 3) using automatic mesh refinement and coarsening (h-refinement), although the software has capabilities for method-order variation (p 2 refinement) and mesh motion (r-refinement) <ref> (Adjerid et al. 1992) </ref>. Adaptive techniques provide an effective tool for addressing CVD fiber coating problems. Meshes are automatically concentrated in boundary layers and are able to capture flow reversals and other complex patterns. <p> Our adaptive system has capabilities for automatic quadtree-structured mesh generation (Baehmann et al. 1987), mesh refinement/coarsening (h-refinement), method-order variation (p-refinement), and mesh motion (r-refinement) <ref> (Adjerid et al. 1992, Moore and Flaherty 1993) </ref>. Although the combination of hand p-refinement can be remarkably efficient (Szabo and Babuska 1991), h-refinement with a piecewise bilinear polynomial basis was used for this application.

Reference-contexts: rate. 3 Finite Element Method The resulting dimensionless system (2.2-16) is solved by a stabilized finite element method (Section 3.1) with adaptive h-refinement (Section 3.2). 8 3.1 Finite Element Formulation Galerkin finite-element methods based on equal polynomial degrees for both velocity and pressure fail to satisfy the Babuska-Brezzi stability condition <ref> (Brezzi and Fortin 1991) </ref>. We overcome this by using a stabilized streamline upwinding (Franca and Frey 1992) that amounts to a perturbation of the standard Galerkin finite element formulation by an elemental least-squares term.

Finally, polynomial least-squares fits of experimental data <ref> (Edwards et al. 1979) </ref> yielded variations of the specific heats, thermal conductivities, and viscosities of argon and oxygen with temperature (Appendix). 4.1 Vertical Reactors Vertical hot- and cold-walled reactors will be affected by buoyancy which can result in over-turning and flow reversals.

Reference-contexts: A ratio of dopant to precursor molecules of 1:11 ensures a deposition of polycrystalline fi Al 2 O 3 <ref> (Jones 1996) </ref>. Molecular weights of important chemical species appear in Table 1. The flow of carrier gas is modeled by the axially-symmetric, compressible Navier-Stokes equations and a coupled energy equation. The precursor species are convected by the carrier gas and may react on hot surfaces according to (1.1) or (1.2). <p> species either deposit on the fiber for low flow rates or exit the reactor. 4.2 Horizontal Reactors We consider horizontal hot- and cold-walled reactors with negligible gravity and precursors Al (OC 4 H 9 ) 3 and La (OCH 2 OC 2 H 5 ) 3 reacting according to (1.2) <ref> (Jones 1996) </ref>. Example 3. Efficiency may possibly be improved by injecting precursor species close to the fibers. We explore this in a hot-walled reactor by setting d = 0:1fii, i = 1; 2; : : : ; 9, and d = 2.

The gaseous mixture is heated by a combination of conduction and convection from heated reactor walls or a heated fiber. The fiber may be directly heated by resistance or microwave radiation <ref> (Kriegsman 1997) </ref> and it also may absorb thermal energy by conduction, convection, and radiation from the fluid and reactor walls.
