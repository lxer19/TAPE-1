Reference-contexts: Once the objects have been divided into clusters, the next stage can describe the individual clusters. Known methods for describing individual clusters, or dot patterns or dot figures, include the external shape description method in [14], internal shape description method in [60] [72], and a fuzzy logic classification in <ref> [2] </ref>. Describing a set of points by humans seems to involve dividing and organizing the points into "clusters" or "gestalts". Many cluster detecting algorithms have been developed. These methods are generally divided into hierarchical and nonhierarchical methods. The details can be seen in [23].

Reference-contexts: Map length is the number of instructions given to the navigator. 27 The map-maker computes the optimal route, based on the optimality criteria, by Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. The time complexity for Dijkstra's algorithm is O (n 2 ) if no fancy data structure is used <ref> [3] </ref>, but if a Fibonacci heap is used as a priority queue, Dijkstra's algorithm takes O (e + n log n), where e is the number of edges and n is the number of vertices. <p> In the most general case, we define two objects to be "connected" if the two objects can be viewed in the same view window of the navigator. This is the central idea of the parkway concept. Then, by applying the connected component algorithm <ref> [3] </ref> using the above definition of "connectedness", 41 we can generate discrete sets of connected components. We define a parkway 1 to be such a connected component. Figure 4.2 shows parkways formed on a world of 100 objects using a window size 10 fi 10. <p> It is interesting to note that trajectories are not commutative and the graph formed by trajectories is in fact a directed graph. Measurement of the connectedness of the parkways is derived by applying strongly connected 50 component algorithm on this directed graph <ref> [3] </ref>. Figure 4.10 shows an example of trajectories computed on our random world. The straight lines are the trajectories of the window in the direction of the sliding movement. <p> As we can see, F and G have 0-columns, therefore are not reachable. This reachability domain problem can be solved by a version of "topological sorting" algorithm and therefore within time complexity O (jEj + jV j) <ref> [3] </ref>. 98 Special case We can increase the number of error recoverable landmarks by adding a further restriction to the general error recoverable conditions. <p> This requires O (n 2 ), were n is the number of vertices in the graph. The algorithm is given in the following <ref> [3] </ref>: begin S fv 0 g; for each v in V fv 0 g do D [v] l (v 0 ; v); whileS 6= V do begin choose a vertex w in V S such that D [w] is a minimum; add w to S; for each v in V S

Reference-contexts: A Masscomp hosted the map-maker, and the high level control of the navigator. Basic image processing was performed using a PIPE (Pipelined Image Processing Engine) system <ref> [4] </ref>. The navigator was a camera with a 12.5mm lens mounted on an IBM 7575 robot arm [27] programmed using IBM's AML/2 programming language [28] (Figure 2.2). The logical components of our system consists of three main modules.

Reference-contexts: These methods include Configuration space by Lozano-Perez [42], Generalized Cones by Brooks <ref> [6] </ref>, Segmented Model by Crowley [10], Grid-based Model by Moravec and Elfes [48], and Convex Cell model by Giralt et al. [22]. <p> The basic idea behind the Configuration Space [42] is that the navigator is "reduced" to a point while all the other objects are "enlarged" accordingly. The problem is then transformed into determining the free space that can be occupied by this reference point. In the Generalized Cone method <ref> [6] </ref>, the free space is represented by overlapping generalized cones, producing "freeways" that represent the free space the navigator is allowed to occupy. In the Segment model used by Crowley [10] in his IMP (Intelligent Mobile Platform) project, the robot's navigational path is represented by a combination of linear segments.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, robot navigation theory has been divided into two groups. First is the traditional AI theory applied to navigation where the high level planning is done prior to the navigation. The other is the reactive control theory based on Brook's subsumption architecture <ref> [7] </ref>, in which the navigation is low level in the sense that the robot navigates by reacting to the environment based on its sensory inputs. Our map-maker and navigator models incorporate both of the two approaches.

Reference-contexts: He concludes that an alternate design of our cognitive map is not possible due to the environment that we live in. Chase <ref> [8] </ref> conducted various laboratory tests and field tests on taxi drivers. His experiments showed that locations in people's minds are organized hierarchically by neighborhoods and regions. For example, two locations within same neighborhood seemed to be more closely bonded with each other then two locations in different neighborhoods. <p> The direction giver must take into consideration various "costs" for the navigation, some of which are listed as follows. * How short is the travel distance? * How much time does it take? * How easy is the road? <ref> [8] </ref> * How easy is it to describe? [44] 103 * How to provide enough information without over burdening the driver? [67] The first 3 items in the above list are related to the derivation of the route.

Reference-contexts: As the robot moves farther, the error grows. Note that whenever a new landmark is identified, the translational error is reset to 0. This is equivalent to the "map 84 matching" technique used in the vehicle navigation systems [20] [41] [18] <ref> [9] </ref>. The basic idea is to use a variable size that is a function of distance.

Reference-contexts: Using their "inexact navigation" model, they show that configuration of visible landmarks is very important for accurately localizing the navigator. The "area of uncertainty", in which the navigator can self-locate within a given error range depends on the choice of landmarks. Dai and Lawton <ref> [11] </ref> suggest qualitative navigation algorithms to work complete at the topological level. They distinguish the difference between "distinctive" and "non-distinctive" landmarks. A distinctive landmark is the one which can be recognized from different points of view 2 .

Reference-contexts: Once the objects have been divided into clusters, the next stage can describe the individual clusters. Known methods for describing individual clusters, or dot patterns or dot figures, include the external shape description method in <ref> [14] </ref>, internal shape description method in [60] [72], and a fuzzy logic classification in [2]. Describing a set of points by humans seems to involve dividing and organizing the points into "clusters" or "gestalts". Many cluster detecting algorithms have been developed. <p> These methods are considered to describe the internal structure of the point sets, whereas the convex-hull or ff-hull methods describe the external shapes <ref> [14] </ref>. A NNG is formed by simply connecting the vertices to produce all nearest neighbor pairs. MST connects every node to some other nodes 59 in such a way that the total length of the edges is minimized and all members of the point set are connected.

Reference-contexts: One important reason for people preferring verbal instructions rather than visual maps, that they neglected, is the computational complexity involved managing the hierarchy of spatial knowledge described in the previous section. Elliott and Lesk <ref> [15] </ref> developed a computer program that generates driving directions using street maps and telephone books. <p> A fourth metric is map length, which is the number of directions that the map-maker gives to the navigator to get from one point to another. This metric measures map transmission costs and memory requirements. A fifth gives preference to straight paths; Elliott and Lesk <ref> [15] </ref> noted that the number of turns and the direction of the turn also affect the time of travel, and therefore counted right turns as 1/8 mile and left turns as 1/4 mile. All of these metrics tradeoff with reliability, which generally decreases with distance traveled.

Reference-contexts: To account for image distortions due to translation, rotation, and perspective, we use a simple geometric calibration matrix A that 126 transforms the homogeneous world coordinates (X; Y; Z; 1) into the homogeneous camera coordinates (U; V; 1) <ref> [21] </ref>. The transformation is represented by the follow ing equation: ~c h = A ~w h (8:1) where ~c h is the homogeneous vector representation of the camera coordinates, A is the transformation matrix, and ~w h is the homogeneous vector representation of the world coordinates.

For each pair of points in the scene compute the mnv (mutual neighborhood value).

Reference-contexts: First, in section 2, we briefly survey related work. This includes studies in psychology concerning cognitive maps and direction giving, and existing qualitative navigation systems. Then in section 3 we present an overview of this dissertation. 1 This problem has been addressed by Kender et al. in <ref> [31] </ref>, in which they present the computational complexity of selecting optimal set of sensors. Even in one-dimensional space, this proves to be an NP-complete problem. 3 1.2 Related work 1.2.1 Cognitive maps A cognitive map is a general common-sense knowledge of space acquired by a human over time. <p> Otherwise, they use the general definition of "distinctiveness" of features in the sensory readings to indicate landmarks. We 2 Similar definition can be seen in <ref> [31] </ref> [32] presented in a more formal way. 12 argue that without detailed criteria for defining and selecting good landmarks, topological navigation is not possible. <p> In the next chapter, we present some of our previous work of landmark based navigation in one-dimensional (lineland) and grid-based two-dimensional (level helicopter world) environments. Kender and Leff <ref> [31] </ref> formalized the basic concept of the map-maker's relationship to the world in different levels of abstractions, and the navigator's custom map dependency. They discovered large range of computationally difficult problems that can be solved only using heuristics, even in a simplified one-dimensional space. <p> Section 1 discusses the model of "Lineland", in which a theoretical framework for topological navigation in one-dimensional space is presented <ref> [31] </ref> 1 . Navigation is based on matching landmarks to partial object descriptions, provided by the direction giver. <p> Therefore, it is introduced here. 15 emphasis of creating efficient directional instructions, which we call custom maps. This is in contrast to much of existing work on robot navigation, which emphasizes spatial learning of metric information through direct experience. 2.1 Linear navigation Kender and Leff <ref> [31] </ref> formalized a model of topological navigation in one-dimensional space, such as corridors and transportation routes, which they named "Lineland". <p> But third and most importantly, the optimization of even a single unit transition is NP-complete in the number of partial models. For detail, see <ref> [31] </ref> Selecting the optimal partial model can be obtained by heuristic search, with the most effective heuristic appearing to be the one that says "select the partial model that conflicts most with all the other objects along the path to node j". <p> In section 1, we described the initial work of Kender and Leff <ref> [31] </ref> that provided a theoretical framework for "environmental navigation" in one-dimensional space. One of the most important contributions of this work was in the formal proof that visual landmark selection and direction giving are in fact a very hard problem even in a simplified error-free one-dimensional space. <p> In another words, the navigator has to be able to constantly keep updating its "you are here" pointer as it moves along [35] <ref> [31] </ref>. However, in some complex areas of the environment, it may be too confusing or even impossible to keep an accurate "you are here" pointer.

Reference-contexts: Otherwise, they use the general definition of "distinctiveness" of features in the sensory readings to indicate landmarks. We 2 Similar definition can be seen in [31] <ref> [32] </ref> presented in a more formal way. 12 argue that without detailed criteria for defining and selecting good landmarks, topological navigation is not possible. <p> They discovered large range of computationally difficult problems that can be solved only using heuristics, even in a simplified one-dimensional space. Kender and Park <ref> [32] </ref> used this framework to implement a landmark based navigator in grid-based two-dimensional space using a camera and a robot arm. They developed useful criteria for creating a custom map based on sensing cost, communication cost, reliability, landmark distinctiveness, and travel time. <p> These criteria can be used in conjunction as well. 20 2.2 Two-dimensional grid world navigation In this section, we describe the work on the topological visual navigation in a two-dimensional grid world, as presented in <ref> [32] </ref>. The domain we explored is a formalized variant of the visual world seen by a level-flying helicopter whose perception is limited to a narrow field of view, and whose visual axis is normal to the world below it. <p> It is able to view small subarea of the environment looking straight down perpendicular to the en 37 world representation only trees, or only houses vironment and z component of the navigator is fixed. Thus we are still in the "level-helicopter" world as in <ref> [32] </ref>, except that we are no longer restricted to a grid structure. For our experiments, we implemented the navigator with an IBM 7575 SCARA robot arm with a CCD camera attached to the robot's end effector. The navigation terrain was the robot arm's workspace. Details are provided in Chapter 8. <p> recovery algorithms; (6) Examples of failures; and (7) Analysis of success and failure cases in the navigation test runs. 143 Chapter 9 Conclusions and Future Work 9.1 Conclusions We have discussed a new method for topological navigation in a large unstructured environment, where metric information is unreliable and expensive [39] <ref> [32] </ref> [69]. Most of the existing qualitative robot navigators emphasize the importance of landmarks, and their navigations depend heavily on the usage of visual landmarks. However, they also assume that landmarks can be readily identified.

Reference-contexts: Even in one-dimensional space, this proves to be an NP-complete problem. 3 1.2 Related work 1.2.1 Cognitive maps A cognitive map is a general common-sense knowledge of space acquired by a human over time. Kuipers <ref> [35] </ref> adopted the concept of cognitive map in his TOUR model. He divides spatial knowledge into a hierarchy of four levels, namely, "sen-sorimotor", "procedural", "topological", and "metrical". <p> The reason for this is because the metric information is inaccurate due to the low mechanical accuracy and sensory errors [69]. Kuipers was one of the first to acknowledge this. He used "qualitative" approaches in his robot navigation projects, namely, the TOUR model <ref> [35] </ref> and the NX Robot [39]. As stated earlier in previous section, the TOUR model adopts the concept of cognitive map in which the spatial knowledge is divided into four levels: "sensorimotor", "procedural", "topological", and "metrical". <p> In chapter 4, we introduce two fundamental graph-like abstract data structures, created and used by the map-maker for representing the environment mainly in the topological level of the cognitive map layer <ref> [35] </ref>. Parkways represent viable paths that are based on visible landmarks, trajectories provide "junctions" between parkways. Various types of parkways and trajectories are introduced. Chapter 5 describes another level of abstraction of the world, the qualitative description language for efficient and error minimizing communication between the map-maker and the navigator. <p> In another words, the navigator has to be able to constantly keep updating its "you are here" pointer as it moves along <ref> [35] </ref> [31]. However, in some complex areas of the environment, it may be too confusing or even impossible to keep an accurate "you are here" pointer.

Reference-contexts: So the performance of this model agrees with the property of representing a common sense knowledge which is to "degrade gracefully in situations with resource limitations". Kuipers goes further in analyzing how cognitive maps are formed in <ref> [38] </ref>. He tries to re-create an artificial cognitive map and compares it with cognitive maps of humans in the five different categories as follows: observations, route description, fixed features, topological relations, and metrical relations.

Reference-contexts: Introduction 1.1 Statement of problem We are interested in navigation in a large and unstructured environment. An environment is regarded as large if at any instant the sensory and motor capacities of the navigating agent reside in a small subset of the whole terrain. Similar definitions can be found in <ref> [39] </ref>. An environment is unstructured if there are no external cues for the navigator to rely on, such as hallways or roads. Navigation in a large unstructured environment requires different information and tools than that of navigation in a small structured environment. <p> Here, the path planning is done by connecting the midpoints of adjacent convex cells that represent the free space. 10 Qualitative navigation Most traditional methods, including the ones introduced in the previous section, perform reasonably well only in small environments and fail to be useful in large unstructured environments <ref> [39] </ref>. The reason for this is because the metric information is inaccurate due to the low mechanical accuracy and sensory errors [69]. Kuipers was one of the first to acknowledge this. He used "qualitative" approaches in his robot navigation projects, namely, the TOUR model [35] and the NX Robot [39]. <p> environments <ref> [39] </ref>.

Most of the existing qualitative robot navigators emphasize the importance of landmarks, and their navigations depend heavily on the usage of visual landmarks. However, they also assume that landmarks can be readily identified.

Reference-contexts: In the topological level, a DP of the environment is represented as a node of the graph data structure. Metric map contains the local geometric information of the place. Levitt et al. proposed qualitative methods for navigation in large scale space <ref> [40] </ref> in their Qualnav model. The simulated robot uses a global map in its spatial memory to indicate each landmark's estimated direction and distance for path planning. In the topological (qualitative) level, Qualnav divides the environment into discrete regions called orientation regions, created by landmark pair boundaries (LBP).

Reference-contexts: As the robot moves farther, the error grows. Note that whenever a new landmark is identified, the translational error is reset to 0. This is equivalent to the "map 84 matching" technique used in the vehicle navigation systems [20] <ref> [41] </ref> [18] [9]. The basic idea is to use a variable size that is a function of distance.

[22]. <p> The basic idea behind the Configuration Space <ref> [42] </ref> is that the navigator is "reduced" to a point while all the other objects are "enlarged" accordingly. The problem is then transformed into determining the free space that can be occupied by this reference point.

Reference-contexts: It then uses a set of domain-specific heuristic rules to determine the clarity and cruciality of each sentence and of the overall direction. Mark states that <ref> [43] </ref> Kuiper's model of spatial knowledge implies (reversely) that a verbal description of the route is better than a visual display of the map. This is because procedural knowledge is lower level than topological or metrical ones.

Reference-contexts: They also study various types of computer and human algorithms for finding the shortest path. Among computer algorithms, depth-first-search gave the most effective result. Typical human algorithms involved a hierarchical combination of divide-and-conquer and depth-first-search. (This is similar to Kuiper's intermediate goal in the TOUR model). Mark <ref> [44] </ref> proposed "ease of description" (minimizing number of turns) as an important factor in choosing routes. To use a computer algorithm to find optimal route using this criterion, he represents route descriptions, which follows Riesbeck's model (described in the next paragraph), using a "frame". <p> The direction giver must take into consideration various "costs" for the navigation, some of which are listed as follows. * How short is the travel distance? * How much time does it take? * How easy is the road? [8] * How easy is it to describe? <ref> [44] </ref> 103 * How to provide enough information without over burdening the driver? [67] The first 3 items in the above list are related to the derivation of the route. Depending on the skills and experience of the driver, the priority of these costs may vary.

Reference-contexts: This is because procedural knowledge is lower level than topological or metrical ones. Mark also conducted an experiment in which 20 sets of invitational directions were analyzed, most of which consisted of customed maps and some of which consisted of verbal instructions <ref> [45] </ref>. The analysis indicated that most people consider orientation information as an important part of navigational aid. Distance information, however, did not prove to be as important because most people omitted the scale indications in their maps.

Reference-contexts: If the navigator's camera is even slightly misaligned to the original direction, this method would fail. A slightly more robust method would be to enumerate the objects in a circular order. This would involve a "wrapping around" algorithm, similar to the "gift wrapping" method to derive convex hulls <ref> [59] </ref>. This method, let us call it spiral inward method, is not susceptible to the errors in the rotational angle of the camera that can be critical to the linear order method.

Reference-contexts: Once the objects have been divided into clusters, the next stage can describe the individual clusters. Known methods for describing individual clusters, or dot patterns or dot figures, include the external shape description method in [14], internal shape description method in <ref> [60] </ref> [72], and a fuzzy logic classification in [2]. Describing a set of points by humans seems to involve dividing and organizing the points into "clusters" or "gestalts". Many cluster detecting algorithms have been developed. These methods are generally divided into hierarchical and nonhierarchical methods. <p> These methods are generally divided into hierarchical and nonhierarchical methods. The details can be seen in [23]. Computational methods of analyzing a cluster include algorithms that build data structures such as nearest neighbor graph (NNG), minimum spanning tree (MST), relative neighborhood graph (RNG), Gabriel graph (GG), Delaunay triangle (DT) <ref> [60] </ref>, and sphere of influence graph (SIG) [72]. These methods are considered to describe the internal structure of the point sets, whereas the convex-hull or ff-hull methods describe the external shapes [14]. A NNG is formed by simply connecting the vertices to produce all nearest neighbor pairs.

Reference-contexts: Another way of finding the optimal path is to use a heuristic search algorithm such as branch-and-bound or the A fl algorithm <ref> [61] </ref>. These algorithms are more costly than Dijkstra's algorithm in the worst case, but if the heuristic function is "good", they can be very effective.

Reference-contexts: His experimental results with 8 various weight constant showed that a person is willing to travel 0.36 km more in order to avoid a turn. Riesbeck <ref> [62] </ref> suggested a computational method for evaluating the clarity of directions. He emphasizes that direction following, which involves a natural language analysis, does not require complete processing of the given instructions until the execution time.

Reference-contexts: Our qualitative environmental navigation system, which consists of the map-maker and the navigator, can be categorized as both a preplanned and reactive type <ref> [65] </ref>. It is preplanned because the desired path of the navigator is precomputed by the map-maker subsystem.

Reference-contexts: The implication of this last phenomenon is that a long term exposure to an environment seems to give people not only a procedural knowledge of the routes but topographical knowledge of the area as well. Streeter and Vitello <ref> [66] </ref> carried out an experiment to investigate the correlation between self-descriptions of each person's navigational skills and of various navigational proficiencies. The results showed that self-described good navigators indeed have higher spatial abilities than those who rated themselves to be poor navigators.

Reference-contexts: What is the best medium in which to deliver the directional instructions to the driver. * How do all these relate to the human spatial abilities? The idea of giving directions in terms of "sensorimotor" or "procedural" information is supported by the result of the investigation by Streeter et al. <ref> [67] </ref>. They performed an experiment on a group of people to compare the effectiveness of four different types of navigational aids: vocal instructions, simplified maps, both together, and commercial maps. The result revealed the superiority of vocal instructions over the other three methods. <p> Sensory range is limited, to a relatively small area of the world (view window), and there is virtually no memory. However, this is an actual advantage; usually, the less that needs to be sensed or remembered the better, since the cognitive load of the navigator is minimized <ref> [67] </ref>. Although more intelligent navigators can be modeled, this one chooses to ignore most of the world and its features for the sake of efficient traversal. <p> It is the map-maker's responsibility to come up with a custom map that will provide the navigator with just the right amount of information in the optimal form. Note that humans prefer this simplified custom map over more complete and redundant form of directional information which may overburdening <ref> [67] </ref>. This chapter is organized as follows. In Section 1, we discuss the issues in designing a language that can describe a given scene qualitatively. Section 2 describes the basic vocabulary that we have developed, the main function of which is to identify a single object in the scene. <p> the navigation, some of which are listed as follows. * How short is the travel distance? * How much time does it take? * How easy is the road? [8] * How easy is it to describe? [44] 103 * How to provide enough information without over burdening the driver? <ref> [67] </ref> The first 3 items in the above list are related to the derivation of the route. Depending on the skills and experience of the driver, the priority of these costs may vary. Also, depending on the priority of each of these costs, the resulting route may vary. <p> For example, it may be necessary to limit the size of the custom map for efficient communication from the map-maker to the navigator. The environmental description language defines the command set available to the navigator in the custom map. Each instruction in the custom map needs to be simple <ref> [67] </ref>, and qualitative, for the sake of efficiency and accuracy. Traditionally, robot navigation theory has been divided into two groups. First is the traditional AI theory applied to navigation where the high level planning is done prior to the navigation.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, in some cases, the navigator can recover from an error by executing a simple recovery sequence. This process of identifying and recovering from an error is of a great importance <ref> [68] </ref>, and thus will be explored in detail in Chapter 6. A subgraph of a parkway that is entirely composed of error detectable directed edges (transitions) is called an error detectable parkway. Likewise, if the edges represent error recoverable paths, then the parkway is called an error recoverable parkway. <p> In our physical setting of the map-maker, the global camera is placed at a position that can capture the whole environment as 1 Our error recovery method can be classified as "forward recovery", as defined in <ref> [68] </ref>, because it replans to get back on track, instead of retracing its traveled route. 71 shown in figure 8.1. The global camera is calibrated by a simple calibration technique, as described in chapter 8, and each object's world coordinates are derived according to the calibration matrix.

A path is a sequence of locations represented in the qualitative or the quantitative map. Sutherland and Thompson <ref> [69] </ref> use similar model for navigation. Using their "inexact navigation" model, they show that configuration of visible landmarks is very important for accurately localizing the navigator. The "area of uncertainty", in which the navigator can self-locate within a given error range depends on the choice of landmarks. <p> algorithms; (6) Examples of failures; and (7) Analysis of success and failure cases in the navigation test runs. 143 Chapter 9 Conclusions and Future Work 9.1 Conclusions We have discussed a new method for topological navigation in a large unstructured environment, where metric information is unreliable and expensive [39] [32] <ref> [69] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This means that performances of the drivers are often influenced by visual cues that are only present on-site. This result agrees with the Kuipers TOUR model in that a partial knowledge can be useful enough during the actual navigation. Thorndyke <ref> [70] </ref> carried out an extensive experiments to compare the spatial knowledge acquired by studying maps versus spatial knowledge acquired by navigational experiences. The results of the experiments showed that generally, learning from maps gave better results than learning from navigation in estimating Euclidean distances (as-the-crow-fly) and locating places.
