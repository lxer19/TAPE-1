Abstract: Two classes of adaptive routers, minimal and non-minimal, are emerging as possible replacements for the oblivious routers used in current multicom-puter networks. In this paper, we compare the simulated performance of three routers, an oblivious, a minimal, and a non-minimal adaptive router, in a two-dimensional packet switching torus network. The non-minimal adaptive router is shown to give the best performance and the oblivious router the worst. Significantly, however, for many traffic patterns, the minimal adaptive router's performance degrades sharply as the network saturates. Based on an analysis made using several visualization tools, we argue that this performance drop results from non-uniformities introduced for deadlock prevention. Furthermore, this analysis has led us to believe that network balance is an important performance characteristic that has been largely overlooked by designers of adaptive routing algorithms.

Reference-contexts: To date, the question of "how much adaptivity?" seems to present a classic complexity vs. flexibility/performance tradeoff. Simulation studies have shown that non-minimal adaptive routers can significantly outperform oblivious routers in hypercube and torus topologies [11, 3, 9, 12, 7]. Bop-pana and Chalasani [4] and Berman et al. <ref> [1] </ref> have shown that several minimal adaptive routing algorithms outperform oblivious routing for wormhole routing networks.

Reference-contexts: We compare the performance of this minimal adaptive router against simulation results previously documented by Fulgham and Snyder [9] for a state-of-the-art oblivious and a non-minimal adaptive router (Chaos router <ref> [11, 3, 2] </ref>). Typically, it is difficult to compare simulation results because different simulation systems encompass different router designs and different timing assumptions (e.g. clock cycle length). In our study, however, performance results for all three routers have been obtained using the same simulator, allowing "apples-to-apples" comparisons. <p> Like the oblivious router, the Chaos router services its channels using a round-robin policy. Because of its relative complexity, the Chaos router is charged with three cycles to process a header flit, resulting in a minimum routing latency of four cycles. Furthermore, implementation considerations <ref> [2] </ref> specify that a cut-through of a packet from the multiqueue to an output frame stalls the router's cut-through function for two cycles.

The MA router's throughput degrades significantly for Random, Hot Spots, and Bit Reversal traffic after saturation. We believe that this also results from network asymmetries introduced for deadlock prevention. We explain this behavior below.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we compare the simulated performance of three routers, an oblivious, a minimal, and a non-minimal adaptive router, in a two-dimensional virtual cut-through packet switching torus network. We base our minimal adaptive router on a routing al-gorithm designed by Cypher and Gravano <ref> [5] </ref>. This algorithm is particularly attractive because it: provides fully minimal adaptive routing (that is, a packet may be routed along all minimal paths between the source and destination), is deadlock and livelock free, and requires a provably minimal amount of buffer space (i.e. virtual channels) for deadlock prevention. <p> Like the oblivious router, however, the Chaos router can only process one packet header at a time. 2.3 Minimal Adaptive Router The minimal adaptive routing algorithm specified by Cypher and Gravano <ref> [5] </ref> works as follows. Each router consists of three central FIFO queues, called the A, B, and C queues, representing three virtual channels. Each incoming channel is connected to all three queues. Similarly, each queue is connected to all outgoing channels. Packets are initially injected into the A queue.

Reference-contexts: This means that, at any time, each packet has only one permissible path through a router that it has reached. If the needed out channel is busy, the packet must wait. Deadlock is avoided using virtual channels as described by Dally and Seitz <ref> [6] </ref>. In the simulated model, the oblivious router requires two cycles to process a header flit and one cycle to route a packet across the wires of the appropriate channel, resulting in a minimum routing latency of three cycles.

Reference-contexts: applied) the progress of a parallel computation will be limited by the throughput of the congested area, suggesting that achievable throughput may be much lower the simulation results given above. 5 Related Work Felperin et al. have reported results for a minimal adaptive routing algorithm in packet switching mesh networks <ref> [8] </ref>. In fact, the algorithm is similar to the algorithm studied here but only works for mesh and hypercube networks. Simulation results show that this algorithm achieves throughput of 75% for Random traffic and 35% for Transpose traffic before network saturation.

Reference-contexts: This implies that each flit must contain at least 8 bits, since our network has 256 nodes. All three routers can send or receive one flit over each of its five channels in one routing time unit (cycle). All three routers are virtual cut-through routers <ref> [10] </ref> that is, once the header flit of a packet has been received and decoded, the router can direct that packet to a free channel before the packet has entirely arrived at that node.
