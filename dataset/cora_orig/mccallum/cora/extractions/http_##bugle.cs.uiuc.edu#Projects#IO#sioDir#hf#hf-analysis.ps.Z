Reference-contexts: In the integral calculation phase, the number of integrals determines the input/output data volume | quadrature data is written for each integral. Because a Fock matrix of size N generates O (N 2 ) one electron and O (N 4 ) two electron integrals <ref> [1] </ref>, the data volume grows dramatically with matrix size and is substantial even for small matrices. This phase is, therefore, write intensive, which shows clearly in Table 2 and Figure 4. The final, self-consistent field calculation phase is quite read intensive, with each node repeatedly reading the integral files.
