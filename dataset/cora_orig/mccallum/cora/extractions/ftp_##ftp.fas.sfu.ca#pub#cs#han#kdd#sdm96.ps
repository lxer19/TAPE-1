Abstract: Spatial data mining, i.e., mining knowledge from large amounts of spatial data, is a highly demanding field because huge amounts of spatial data have been collected in various applications, ranging from remote sensing, to geographical information systems (GIS), computer cartography, environmental assessment and planning, etc. The collected data far exceeded human's ability to analyze. Recent studies on data mining have extended the scope of data mining from relational and transactional databases to spatial databases. This paper summarizes recent works on spatial data mining, from spatial data generalization, to spatial data clustering, mining spatial association rules, etc. It shows that spatial data mining is a promising field, with fruitful research results and many challenging issues.

Reference-contexts: With the advent of data mining, researchers proposed various methods for discovering knowledge from large databases. Most of them concentrate on relational or transaction databases. These methods strived to combine the already mature areas like machine learning, databases and statistics. Studies like <ref> [1, 25, 43] </ref> laid a foundation for spatial data mining. Machine learning techniques learning from examples and generalization and specialization are widely used in spatial data mining. It did not take long before the statistical cluster analysis technique was modified for the use in spatial data mining [41]. <p> In many situations we want to discover spatial association rules, rules that associate one or more spatial objects with other spatial objects. The concept of association rules was introduced by Agrawal et al. <ref> [1] </ref> in a study of mining large transaction databases. Koperski and Han [34] extended this concept to spatial databases. A spatial association rule is of the form X ! Y (c%), where X and Y are sets of spatial or nonspatial predicates and c% is the confidence of the rule.

Reference-contexts: Data mining represents the integration of several fields, including machine learning, database systems, data visualization, statistics, and information theory. Although there have been many studies of data mining in relational and transaction databases <ref> [2, 16, 25, 43] </ref>, data mining is in great demand in other applicative databases, including spatial databases, temporal databases, object-oriented databases, multimedia databases, etc. Our focus of this overview is on the methods of spatial data mining, i.e., discovery of interesting knowledge from spatial data.

In this study [7] the authors described an extension of general framework for database mining in relational databases based on evidential theory <ref> [3] </ref> to mine knowledge from spatial databases.

Reference-contexts: Spatial Query Processing: Optimization strategies for spatial query processing are outlined in Aref and Samet [5]. The authors proposed an architecture for spatial database called SAND (spatial and nonspatial data) architecture, which is a model of the extended relational database with spatial operations <ref> [4] </ref>. This architecture provides both spatial and nonspatial components of spatial database to participate in query processing and optimization. 1.2 Spatial Data Mining Architecture Various architectures (models) have been proposed for data mining. <p> Non-spatial description of spatial objects can be stored in a traditional relational database where one attribute is a pointer to spatial description of the object <ref> [4] </ref>. Spatial data can be described using two different properties, geometric and topological. For example, geometric properties can be spatial location, area, perimeter, etc., whereas topological properties can be adjacency (object A is neighbor of object B), inclusion (object A is inside in object B), and others.

Reference-contexts: In order to build indices for these data, multidimensional trees have been proposed. These include quad trees [46], k-d trees, R-trees, R*-trees, etc. One of the prominent SAMs which was much discussed in the literature recently is R-tree [23] and its modification R*-tree <ref> [6] </ref>. Objects stored in R-trees are approximated by Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBR). R-tree in every node stores a set of rectangles. At the leaves there are stored pointers to representation of polygon's boundaries and polygon's MBRs.

Reference-contexts: Eigenvalues were treated as attributes describing volcanos. Then the final task, which is performed by the rest of the system, is to discriminate between volcanos and other objects looking like volcanos. Such "false alarms" are caused by objects on the surface of Venus causing intensity deviations <ref> [7] </ref>. The final component of the system uses training examples provided by the experts to create a classifier that can discriminate between volcanos and "false alarms". The decision tree method [45] was used for this task. <p> One interesting study was done by Bell et al. <ref> [7] </ref> who proposed a method for knowledge discovery in spatial databases based upon evidence theory [21].

Bell et al. <ref> [7] </ref> gave an example of how this method can be applied to image databases. Major et al. [36] used IXL T M commercial tool for mining of the tropical storm database. The goal was to predict if hurricanes can reach the U.S. territory. <p> Mining under uncertainty: Use of evidential reasoning [21] can be explored in the mining process for image databases and other databases where uncertainty modeling has to be done. As mentioned in Bell et al's <ref> [7] </ref>, evidential theory can model uncertainty better than traditional probabilistic models, like Bayesian methods. Fuzzy sets approach was applied to spatial reasoning [10, 11] and it can be extended to spatial data mining.

Reference-contexts: In order to make spatial queries efficient spatial join has to be efficient as well. Brinkhoff et al. proposed an efficient multilevel processing of spatial joins using R*-Trees and various approximation of spatial objects <ref> [8] </ref>. The first step - filter finds possible pairs of intersecting objects using first their MBRs and later other approximations. In the second step refinement- detailed geometric procedure is performed to check for intersection. Another important spatial operation, map overlay, is especially important in Geographic Information Systems.

Reference-contexts: Spatial data mining, or knowledge discovery in spatial database, refers to the extraction of implicit knowledge, spatial relations, or other patterns not explicitly stored in spatial databases [34]. Previous works in machine learning [17, 38, 39], database systems [50, 51], and statistics <ref> [9, 19, 31, 47] </ref> laid the foundation for research into knowledge discovery in databases. Also, advances in spatial databases, such as spatial data structures [22, 23, 46], spatial reasoning [10, 12], computational geometry [43], etc., paved the way for the study of spatial data mining.
