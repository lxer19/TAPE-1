Abstract: Published as: A.H.M. ter Hofstede, H.A. Proper, and Th.P. van der Weide. Data Modelling in Complex Application Domains. In P. Loucopoulos, editor, Proceed- ings of the Fourth International Conference CAiSE'92 on Advanced Information Systems Engineering, volume 593 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 364-377, Manchester, United Kingdom, May 1992. Springer-Verlag. Abstract In many non trivial application domains, object types with a complex structure occur. Data modelling techniques which only allow flat structures are not suitable for representing such complex object types. In this paper a general data modelling technique, the Predicator Set Model, is introduced, which is capable of representing complex structures in a natural way. The expressiveness of the Predicator Set Model is illustrated by means of a number of examples. In those examples, the Predicator Set Model's expressiveness is related to the expressiveness of more traditional modelling techniques. Fur- thermore, some notational conventions are defined, which enable a more compact representation of complex structures.
