Reference-contexts: Oscar Gonzalez is currently finishing his Ph.D. thesis at Stanford and has proposed a method for constructing energy momentum integrators for mechanical systems that involve holonomic constraints. The following algorithm was constructed based on Oscar's general construction. Several useful references for energy-momentum integrators are <ref> [Gonzales and Simo, 1994] </ref>, [Tarnow, 1993], [Simo and Gonzalez, 1993], and [Simo and Tarnow, 1992]. Oscar Gonzalez's general construction for energy-momentum integrators is briefly summarized in this section. The construction introduces a discrete differential which is analogous to the continuous differential.

Reference-contexts: Patterns have been discovered in Hamiltonian systems when the flow of the system is viewed in a rotating frame. This was studied for point vortices in <ref> [Kunin et al., 1992] </ref>. A goal in [Marsden and Scheurle, 1995] is to develop theory for this phenomenon. This thesis provides a summary of the theory and demonstrates the pattern evocation phenomenon in the double spherical pendulum.

Reference-contexts: Patterns have been discovered in Hamiltonian systems when the flow of the system is viewed in a rotating frame. This was studied for point vortices in [Kunin et al., 1992]. A goal in <ref> [Marsden and Scheurle, 1995] </ref> is to develop theory for this phenomenon. This thesis provides a summary of the theory and demonstrates the pattern evocation phenomenon in the double spherical pendulum. <p> The energy-momentum integrator is compared to a differential-algebraic equation solver for multibody systems called MEXX. This work suggests that energy-momentum integrators may provide simulation results quickly at reasonable accuracy. A summary of the theory in <ref> [Marsden and Scheurle, 1995] </ref> is presented in the first section of the thesis. The next section describes the simulation and visualization method used to search for the patterns in the DSP simulation data. The following section presents the simulation results and describes three examples of pattern evocation. <p> This section concludes by comparing the results from the energy-momentum integrator and the MEXX simulation. Part of the work presented in this thesis is published in [Marsden et al., 1995]. 2 Summary of Theory on Pattern Evocation A summary of some of the theory in <ref> [Marsden and Scheurle, 1995] </ref> is presented in this section. <p> This can happen if an adaptive step size algorithm is used. Energy-momentum integrators may have applications in real-time simulation of multibody systems if they provide accurate results for large, fixed step sizes. 6 Conclusion A background of the theory of pattern evocation in <ref> [Marsden and Scheurle, 1995] </ref> is presented in this thesis. The theory demonstrates an interaction between continuous groups, reduced phase spaces and discrete symmetries in the evocation of patterns. Several examples of pattern evocation in the double spherical pendulum are shown to demonstrate the theory.
