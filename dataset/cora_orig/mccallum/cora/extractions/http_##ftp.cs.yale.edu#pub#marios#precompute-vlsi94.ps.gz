Title: Precomputation-Based Sequential Logic Optimization for Low Power  
Author: Mazhar Alidina Jose Monteiro Srinivas Devadas Abhijit Ghosh Marios Papaefthymiou 
Abstract: We address the problem of optimizing logic-level sequential circuits for low power. We present a powerful sequential logic optimization method that is based on selectively precomputing the output logic values of the circuit one clock cycle before they are required, and using the precomputed values to reduce internal switching activity in the succeeding clock cycle. We present two different precomputation architectures which exploit this observation. The primary optimization step is the synthesis of the precomputation logic, which computes the output values for a subset of input conditions. If the output values can be precomputed, the original logic circuit can be "turned off" in the next clock cycle and will have substantially reduced switching activity. The size of the precomputation logic determines the power dissipation reduction, area increase and delay increase relative to the original circuit. Given a logic-level sequential circuit, we present an automatic method of synthesizing pre-computation logic so as to achieve maximal reductions in power dissipation. We present experimental results on various sequential circuits. Upto 75 percent reductions in average switching M. Alidina and S.

Reference-contexts: Optimization for low power can be applied at many different levels of the design hierarchy. For instance, algorithmic and architectural transformations can trade off throughput, circuit area, and power dissipation <ref> [4] </ref>, and logic optimization methods have been shown to have a significant impact on the power dissipation of combinational logic circuits [12]. In CMOS circuits, the probabilistic average switching activity of the circuit is a good measure of the average power dissipation of the circuit.
