Title: SPATIAL SEMANTIC HIERARCHY FRAMEWORK FOR VACUUMING ROBOTS

Abstract: Developing an autonomous intelligent vacuuming robot, especially for household floors is not a trivial task given its various tough functional requirements. This paper discusses the functional requirements and de scribes how the Spatial Semantic Hierarchy (SSH) theory can provide a suitable framework to building intelligent mobile robots or an autonomous intelligent household vacuuming robot in particular. This paper also describes briefly the architecture for an in stantiation of a SSH robot.

Reference-contexts: based solely on dead reckoning will be mostly over short distances and thus with small acceptable accumulated dead reckoning error. 3 An Instantiation of a SSH robot Recently, there has been much work on hybrid or integrated architectures which combines low-level reactive subsystem with high-level control (cognitive) subsystem: [Gat, 1991] <ref> [Connell, 1992] </ref> [Noreils, 1989] to name a few. The Spatial Semantic Hierarchy framework supports straightforwardly an integrated architecture. We are currently implementing the SSH approach on a physical robot around the architecture as depicted in figure 1.

Reference-contexts: used for path planning and navigation including homing to maximize efficiency and to ensure reasonable floor coverage (i.e. minimal dirty vacuumable spots), and for supporting job performance improvement through experience. 1.2 Spatial Semantic Hierarchy Approach In view of the above vacuuming robot functional requirements, the Spatial Semantic Hierarchy (SSH) approach <ref> [Kuipers and Byun, 1988] </ref> [Kuipers and Levitt, 1988] [Kuipers et al., 1993] provides a good framework for developing a vacuuming robot.
