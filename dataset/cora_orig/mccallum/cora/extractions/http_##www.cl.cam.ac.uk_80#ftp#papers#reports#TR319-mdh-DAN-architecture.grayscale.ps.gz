Reference-contexts: The Pandora box also provides an illustration of this problem the network interface card had to be upgraded to include a second Transputer to give satisfactory network performance. It seems likely that the use of multimedia will grow. The applications produced thus far, termed "first generation" by <ref> [Adam93a] </ref>, deliver the multimedia data to the user, and therefore are active on a human time-scale. As processor speeds increase it will become possible for the machine to manipulate the data in addition to simply displaying it. <p> Most proposals fall into the first two classes identified in section 4.3; either efficient interfaces or separate interconnects. Two projects that are directly comparable with the DAN work are the ViewStation project at MIT <ref> [Adam93a] </ref> and the NetStation at ISI/USC [Finn91]. Like the DAN the ViewStation uses an ATM interconnect, being based on a high speed ATM switch fabric with a data rate of 700Mbit/s on each port.

Reference-contexts: Network interfaces provide connections to 1Gbit/s links and, as in the DAN, it is only here that VCIs are remapped and a full transmission system used. The main device produced, called the VidBoard, is the equivalent of an ATM camera <ref> [Adam93b] </ref>. This is similar to the version 2 camera described above, and can perform simple manipulation in addition to just capture. A TURBOchannel interface to the fabric allows the use of DECStation 5000 and DEC Alpha AXP systems for processing power and to provide the display.

Reference-contexts: Both this and earlier work by the same group use the ATUM traces, captured by modified microcode on a VAX <ref> [Agarwal86] </ref>. This set of traces contains a variety of workloads and includes the operating system behaviour. [Smith87], the reference paper on cache line sizes, includes simulations from traces taken from systems based on the Zilog Z8000, the DEC VAX 11/780, the Motorola 68000, the CDC 6400 and the IBM 370.

Reference-contexts: More recently this problem has been addressed through novel cache architectures, for example <ref> [Agarwal93] </ref> presents a design for a cache with the miss performance of a 2 way associative cache, but the hardware simplicity of a direct mapped cache. Also, as [Przybylski88] points out, the effects of the system in which the cache is used must also be considered. <p> There is a closer match between the DAN results and the uniprocessor results reported in <ref> [Agarwal93] </ref>. While this paper describes a new cache design, which achieves results very close to those of a 2 way associative cache with similar hardware cost to a direct mapped one, the trace driven simulation results are given for other cache organisations as well.

Reference-contexts: A CMOS version of this device being produced by LSI logic is functionally equivalent, but uses less power and is slower, driving a 100 - 150MByte/s ringlet. CERN demonstrated the GaAs chip running at half speed in April 1993 [Gustavson93], and Dolphin have demonstrated a four node multiprocessor system <ref> [Alnes93] </ref>. A bus interface, the C-Bus [Dol92], is provided by the interface chips. This is a general purpose interface and is being used to provide SCI links to machines based on the VME bus, FutureBus, TURBOchannel and Apple Macintosh Quadra Internal bus.

Reference-contexts: Since no other processes were running the only kernel activity was the timer interrupt and two network housekeeping threads which run infrequently. The initial phase of the program consists of a flex and bison 2 parser which accepts a subset of the PLPL PAL description language <ref> [AMD88] </ref>. The input for the compiler is usually read from a file on the unix filesystem using the Wanda Dumb File System 3 (WDFS). Accessing the fileserver over the network tends to cause the behaviour of the program to be slightly unpredictable.

Reference-contexts: This section of the card needs to be redesigned, probably based on an AMD MACH 210 PAL <ref> [AMD91] </ref> which contains the equivalent logic to approximately 6 of the PALs currently used.

Reference-contexts: It certainly seems feasible. Several other projects are also considering scheduling an interconnect. The AN2 local area ATM switch uses a combination of static allocation and dynamic computation to form a schedule for every cell time <ref> [Anderson93] </ref>. The SYMPHONY architecture for a multimedia workstation [Bovopoulos93], which uses the separate interconnect approach, also suggests scheduling the multimedia interconnect. ATM is connection oriented. That is, before any communication can take place a connection must have been established between the end-points. <p> The exact form of the ATM interconnect is not a concern of the DAN architecture. Just as rings [Tennenhouse89], crossbars <ref> [Leslie91, Anderson93] </ref> and buses [Fraser92] have all been used in ATM switches, so they may be used in a DAN machine. It is the transfer of fixed-sized cells and the asynchronous multiplexing that are the key features.

Reference-contexts: The DAN processor node is based on the ARM600 processor <ref> [ARM92] </ref>. This is a derivative of the ARM series of processors that are used in the Fairisle Port Controller, thus all the libraries and support tools existed at the start of the project. It uses the ARM6 macro cell with a 4kbyte primary cache, a write buffer, and an MMU.

Reference-contexts: Pixel tiles are used in the version 2 camera because the 2 dimensional locality makes both compression and error recovery easier. With an ATM CCD such tiles could be directly read from the sensing array. 4.5.3 The DAN Audio/DSP Node The audio node <ref> [Atkinson93] </ref> is designed both to provide audio I/O to the DAN workstation, and to be available as a general signal processing node 3 . A CODEC provides audio capture and replay at a variety of common rates.

Reference-contexts: In the Computer Laboratory the Cambridge Ring [Hopper78] and its successors are based on ATDM techniques. ATM is currently being standardised for use in the wide area Broadband ISDN [CCITT90]. This has caused local area ATM to become more popular, with the "ATM Forum" working on standards <ref> [NCLATM92, ATMUNI93] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It is not clear what interface such a device should present. It is possibly the case that rather than an "ATM disc" the node should be an "ATM filesystem", and have sufficient CPU power to enable the lowest level storage service (or "byte segment custode" in the OPERA terminology <ref> [Bacon93] </ref>) to be implemented. [Jardetzky92] provides a discussion of fileserver design for continuous media. 7.2 An Operating System for the DAN Both the architectural design of the DAN and the specific implementation suggest the need for operating system support to exploit the architectural features of a DAN based machine.

(p 26) </title>
Reference-contexts: For a large number of experiments the Port Controllers were used as stand alone machines running the Wanda kernel. To permit the connection of other hosts a VME interface was built, but this was not used to any great extent <ref> [Beeler92] </ref>. The main host interfaces used for the Fairisle network are provided by boards designed at Olivetti Research, with whom the transmission interface was jointly devised [Hayter92a]. The "Yes" board provides a TURBOchannel interface for DEC workstations, and with a Mezzanine board gives a VME interface [Greaves93].
Reference: [Berc93] <author> Lance Berc. J-Video. </author> <type> Personal communication, </type> <year> 1993. </year> <title> (p 14) </title>
Reference-contexts: There are three main causes for this. Most of the systems in currently in use, such as Pandora and the Lancaster MNI [Blair93], use multimedia peripherals that work beside the main machine rather than as part of it. Secondly, even in systems like the J-Video project <ref> [Berc93] </ref> that do take the video through the processor there is no operating system assistance, so the main concern of the application is the real-time aspects of the data. Finally the movement of the continuous data tends to cause the network subsystem to become the system bottleneck.

Reference-contexts: AAL 5, and 2 At the time of writing AAL 2 has not been completed or approved. 3 Originally adaptation layers 3 and 4 were distinct, but they have now been combined. 12 the similar protocol AAL X used in the Bell Labs XUNET project <ref> [Berenbaum93] </ref>, use the end-to-end bit in the cell header to mark cells as being the end of a SAR block. These cells contain length and CRC fields for verifying correct reception and reassembly of a block.

Reference-contexts: It is derived from the Unison DataLink format for cells on the CFR [Tennenhouse86]. This has passed through a series of modifications, with the intention being to move to something more like the standard cell. The Fairisle DataLink Cell format <ref> [Black93a] </ref> was used with the SAR1A segmentation and reassembly protocol [Black93b] as the adaptation layer.

Reference-contexts: However, it is notable that continuous media are not yet first class data objects. There are three main causes for this. Most of the systems in currently in use, such as Pandora and the Lancaster MNI <ref> [Blair93] </ref>, use multimedia peripherals that work beside the main machine rather than as part of it. <p> This rules out the solutions used in the Pandora [Hopper90] and Lancaster MNI <ref> [Blair93] </ref> systems, which totally exclude the high bandwidth traffic from the main machine.

Reference-contexts: This allows both the double translation and multiplexing problems to be addressed. For example the SYMPHONY architecture uses two schedulable ATM buses in addition to the main system bus <ref> [Bovopoulos93] </ref>. On a more limited scale [Sakata93] uses a B-ISDN aware bus to connect the multimedia peripherals; this bus acts as a "peripheral" to the main machine. 31 This approach works well for first generation applications, where it behaves in a similar manner to the total exclusion method. <p> It certainly seems feasible. Several other projects are also considering scheduling an interconnect. The AN2 local area ATM switch uses a combination of static allocation and dynamic computation to form a schedule for every cell time [Anderson93]. The SYMPHONY architecture for a multimedia workstation <ref> [Bovopoulos93] </ref>, which uses the separate interconnect approach, also suggests scheduling the multimedia interconnect. ATM is connection oriented. That is, before any communication can take place a connection must have been established between the end-points. A virtual circuit identifier uniquely identifies such a connection.

Reference-contexts: Bell Labs have been working in the area since 1969 producing three experimental ATDM LANs: Spider, Datakit and Incon [Fraser93]. In the Computer Laboratory the Cambridge Ring [Hopper78] and its successors are based on ATDM techniques. ATM is currently being standardised for use in the wide area Broadband ISDN <ref> [CCITT90] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This is an example of an interconnect that was designed specifically for processor-processor traffic. The Atomic project at ISI has used the Mosaic chip as a switch element to build a high speed LAN <ref> [Cohen92] </ref>. The regularity of the interconnect is not present in a LAN so the Mosaic source routeing has been extended to allow packets to be prefixed with a sequence of (X, Y) pairs. Standard Mosaic routeing is used for hops described by each pair.

Reference-contexts: An interface chip is used to convert the Mosaic byte-by-byte acknowledgement flow control into a window based protocol. A line driver/receiver pair is used to interface to twisted pair cable at rates of up to 316Mbit/s <ref> [Cohen93] </ref>. The use of optical fiber will be considered when its cost drops. Much stress in the Atomic project is put on the use of the Mosaic chips to provide flexibility at all points in the network.

Reference-contexts: The primary cache is actually on the processor chip, and is typically a fairly small (4-16kbytes) direct mapped write-through cache. The secondary cache is a much larger external cache and is frequently copy-back. Recent CPUs, such as the MIPS R4000 [MIPS91] and the DEC Alpha AXP 21064 <ref> [DEC92c] </ref>, provide on chip support for the secondary cache, improving the possibilities for pipelining tag checking.

Reference-contexts: It provides the main platform for systems research at Cambridge, and is used in both the Fairisle switches and the Desk Area Network prototype. The design philosophy for the Wanda system is described in <ref> [Dixon92] </ref>. Wanda has been ported to many platforms and processors including Vax, Motorola 68000 series, ARM and R3000. There are two main Wanda variants, the standard or "target" version which uses an MMU to implement memory protection and management and the "single address space"(SAS) version which runs without an MMU. <p> Research done on the Cambridge Fast Ring has demonstrated this. [McAuley90] observes that the existence of only a single cell buffer limits the performance of the ARM and VME interfaces. <ref> [Dixon92] </ref> describes some of the effects this has on network device driver code. The Pandora box also provides an illustration of this problem the network interface card had to be upgraded to include a second Transputer to give satisfactory network performance.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps of greater interest is the convergence with the internal machine interconnect. Several recent papers have observed this and expect the internal and external speeds to remain similar for some time <ref> [Druschel93] </ref>. Many workstations are now shipped equipped with multimedia peripherals. The 28 Pandora system [Hopper90] illustrates some of the many possibilities that will become available when networked multimedia systems become more common.

Reference-contexts: In the DEC 3000 AXP systems the problem of DMA blocking CPU access to memory is relieved by the "system crossbar" buffering DMA traffic and permitting interleaved CPU cycles <ref> [Dutton92] </ref>. The second problem is one of data format transformation. Frequently the unit of data movement within the machine (the DMA block size for example) is suited neither to the format of the data on the network, nor to its end-point format in the machine.

Reference-contexts: It is also clear that while suboptimal for small caches, the LRU replacement algorithm is close to optimal for caches of 64kbytes and larger. 6.2.7 Comparison with Other Results A recent study has used trace driven simulation with traces of several hundred million accesses <ref> [Ewy93] </ref>. It concentrated on the secondary cache parameters using a primary cache with a miss rate of 9.15%. Most of the reported results were for the SPARC architecture, but enough experiments were done on other systems to suggest 64 that the results are valid for a range of RISC processors. <p> The use of a processor which directly controls the secondary 82 cache would greatly simplify the node. Direct CPU control is also likely to enable pipelining to improve the hit access time to the secondary cache. <ref> [Ewy93] </ref> shows that for large secondary caches the hit access time is of far greater importance in the performance of the machine than the access time for main memory. So tuning the speed of the secondary cache may well offset the relatively long access time across the DAN.

Reference-contexts: Here the idea of quality of service is being used as the processor scheduling paradigm. At the lowest level processes are guaranteed a minimum percentage of the CPU. The project has produced the architectural description of the Nemesis kernel which forms the basis for the system <ref> [Fairbairns93] </ref>. This scheduling paradigm has been shown to support the reception of video that has been coded in a layered manner. Even simple JPEG compressed sources can be supported. JPEG represents the image as 8x8 blocks of video encoded as a discrete frequency spectrum.

Reference-contexts: These hosts are unable to generate large data rates, but traffic generation code has transferred data at over 400Mbit/s. The use of the Atomic network for both intra- and inter- machine communications, as suggested by <ref> [Finn91] </ref>, is discussed in Chapter 4. 2.2 Asynchronous Transfer Mode The use of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), also known as Asynchronous Time Division Multiplexing (ATDM), has become popular in the past few years. ATDM has a long history of use in the local area. <p> This is being done in the extensions to SCI for use with data acquisition systems, which are proposed by CERN (see section 2.1.1). The Atomic project at ISI is also following this path (see section 2.1.4), starting from the Caltech Mosaic interconnect. As a follow-on project <ref> [Finn91] </ref> suggests constructing multimedia systems using Mosaic and Atomic links; this is similar to the proposals in this dissertation and is discussed in more detail in the related work section (4.7). 4.3.4 Extend an ATM LAN into the Machine A similar idea is to extend local area technology into a machine. <p> Most proposals fall into the first two classes identified in section 4.3; either efficient interfaces or separate interconnects. Two projects that are directly comparable with the DAN work are the ViewStation project at MIT [Adam93a] and the NetStation at ISI/USC <ref> [Finn91] </ref>. Like the DAN the ViewStation uses an ATM interconnect, being based on a high speed ATM switch fabric with a data rate of 700Mbit/s on each port.

Reference-contexts: The exact form of the ATM interconnect is not a concern of the DAN architecture. Just as rings [Tennenhouse89], crossbars [Leslie91, Anderson93] and buses <ref> [Fraser92] </ref> have all been used in ATM switches, so they may be used in a DAN machine. It is the transfer of fixed-sized cells and the asynchronous multiplexing that are the key features.

Reference-contexts: ATDM has a long history of use in the local area. Bell Labs have been working in the area since 1969 producing three experimental ATDM LANs: Spider, Datakit and Incon <ref> [Fraser93] </ref>. In the Computer Laboratory the Cambridge Ring [Hopper78] and its successors are based on ATDM techniques. ATM is currently being standardised for use in the wide area Broadband ISDN [CCITT90]. This has caused local area ATM to become more popular, with the "ATM Forum" working on standards [NCLATM92, ATMUNI93].

Reference-contexts: The LAN is shared with others and more caution is needed. Device control and reliability are the main areas for contrast between the DAN and projects such as the ORL Medusa <ref> [Glauert93] </ref>, where devices are connected to an ATM LAN within an office. On the LAN a greater amount of processing power must be put into devices to manage control and security functions.

Reference-contexts: This is reflected in the relative sizes of the single chip switching fabric and the port controllers which take up a double height Eurocard. The fabric and two types of port controller are described below. 3.2 The Switch Fabric The Fairisle switch fabric <ref> [Leslie91, Gordon93a] </ref> forms the basis for both the ATM LAN switches and the interconnect used in the prototype DAN described in the next chapter. A switch fabric, adapted from that designed by Peter Newman [Newman89], is based on 4fi4 self-routeing crossbar elements.

Reference-contexts: The FIQ is thus able to run even if the kernel has "interrupts disabled". 3.4 The Null Port Controller The Null Port Controller is a replacement for the standard Port Controller which can be used on low bandwidth links <ref> [Gordon93b] </ref>. The card performs reception and transmission to the line and fabric, and performs remapping of VCIs, but it has no buffering functions. This design is much simpler, and is therefore cheaper.

Reference-contexts: The development of ATM networks at Cambridge has previously been based on ring networks. In particular the systems research environment has been supported by the Fast Ring [Temple84, Hopper88] and the Backbone Ring <ref> [Greaves90] </ref>. In these networks the hardware based media-access control provides the sharing policy. Using a switch based network allows policy to be implemented in each switch. In addition extra management issues, such as what happens when a machine moves, need to be faced on a non-shared-media LAN.

Reference-contexts: A CMOS version of this device being produced by LSI logic is functionally equivalent, but uses less power and is slower, driving a 100 - 150MByte/s ringlet. CERN demonstrated the GaAs chip running at half speed in April 1993 <ref> [Gustavson93] </ref>, and Dolphin have demonstrated a four node multiprocessor system [Alnes93]. A bus interface, the C-Bus [Dol92], is provided by the interface chips.

Reference-contexts: In this chapter the motivation for the development of this architecture is given, along with a description of the prototype implementation. The architecture was originally proposed in <ref> [Hayter91] </ref>. The target environment for the DAN is a multimedia workstation which uses a high speed ATM LAN to become part of a distributed system. 4.1 Introduction The network forms a vital component of a distributed system.

Reference-contexts: To permit the connection of other hosts a VME interface was built, but this was not used to any great extent [Beeler92]. The main host interfaces used for the Fairisle network are provided by boards designed at Olivetti Research, with whom the transmission interface was jointly devised <ref> [Hayter92a] </ref>. The "Yes" board provides a TURBOchannel interface for DEC workstations, and with a Mezzanine board gives a VME interface [Greaves93].

Reference-contexts: Access to the cell buffers is slow (observed at 700ns per word for an earlier version of the port controller <ref> [Hayter92b] </ref>) and the extra 7:6s taken by the write basically consists of nine reads of the buffer (the address and 8 data words) and the eight writes to main memory. Interestingly, the user-space version is slower for reads than writes.

Reference-contexts: This design, known as "Xi3"[Hayter93c], became the standard and is the one used in all experiments described in this dissertation. The third revision of the Port Controller PCB uses a larger Xilinx chip. The "Xi3" design was extended into "Xi5" 3 to take advantage of this device <ref> [Hayter93a] </ref>. Extra counters and timestamping mechanisms were added to assist with measurements and flow control experiments. In addition there was some re-ordering of control bits to assist in the move to the ATM Forum cell header format.
