Title: Color- and Texture-Based Image Segmentation Using EM and Its Application to Content-Based Image Retrieval

Abstract: Retrieving images from large and varied collections using image content as a key is a challenging and important problem. In this paper we present a new image representation which provides a transformation from the raw pixel data to a small set of image regions which are coherent in color and texture space. This so-called blobworld representation is based on segmentation using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm on combined color and texture features. The texture features we use for the segmentation arise from a new approach to texture description and scale selection. We describe a system that uses the blobworld representation to retrieve images. An important and unique aspect of the system is that, in the context of similarity-based querying, the user is allowed to view the internal representation of the submitted image and the query results. Similar systems do not offer the user this view into the workings of the system; consequently, the outcome of many queries on these systems can be quite inexplicable, despite the availability of knobs for adjusting the similarity metric.

Reference-contexts: Neither constraint holds in our case: the shape, size, and color of objects like cheetahs and polar bears are quite variable, and segmentation is imperfect. Clearly, classical object recognition does not apply.

Reference-contexts: Ideally we would like to choose that value of K that best suits the natural number of groups present in the image. One readily available notion of goodness of fit is the log-likelihood. Given this indicator, we can apply the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle <ref> [22] </ref> to select among values of K. As a consequence of this principle, when models using two values of K fit the data equally well, the simpler model will be chosen. For our experiments, K ranges from 2 to 5.
