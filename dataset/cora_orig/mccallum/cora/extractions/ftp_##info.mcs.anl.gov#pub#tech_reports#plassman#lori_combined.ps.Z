Title: ON COMBINING LAPLACIAN AND OPTIMIZATION-BASED MESH SMOOTHING TECHNIQUES

Abstract: Local mesh smoothing algorithms have been shown to be effective in repairing distorted elements in automatically generated meshes. The simplest such algorithm is Laplacian smoothing, which moves grid points to the geometric center of incident vertices. Unfortunately, this method operates heuristically and can create invalid meshes or elements of worse quality than those contained in the original mesh. In contrast, optimization-based methods are designed to maximize some measure of mesh quality and are very effective at eliminating extremal angles in the mesh. These improvements come at a higher computational cost, however. In this article we propose four smoothing techniques that combine a smart variant of Laplacian smoothing with an optimization-based approach. Several numerical experiments are performed that compare the mesh quality and computational cost for each of the methods in two and three dimensions. We find that the combined approaches are very cost effective and yield high-quality meshes.

Reference-contexts: For finite element techniques using simplicial meshes, poorly shaped or distorted elements can result in numerical difficulties during the solution process, particularly as the elements approach the limits of 0 o or 180 o <ref> (Babuska and Aziz, 1976, Fried, 1972) </ref>. This problem is more severe in three dimensions than in two dimensions because tetrahedral meshes tend to have a larger proportion of severely distored elements than do triangular meshes.

Reference-contexts: a four element airfoil meshed with the Carnegie Mellon Triangle Delaunay mesh generation code (Shewchuk, 1996) 2. a single element airfoil meshed with the QMG quadtree mesh generator (Vavasis and Mitchell, 1996), 3. a branched channel geometry meshed with an anisotropic wavefront algorithm used by Tim Barth at NASA Ames <ref> (Barth, 1994) </ref>. For this case we smooth only the subset of grid points that are not incident to anisotropic el ements. In this way, transition regions between anisotropic and isotropic elements can be significantly improved with out affecting boundary layer elements.

Reference-contexts: Both techniques require a spatial decomposition of the computational domain into a union of simple geometric elements such as triangles or quadrilaterals in two dimensions and tetrahedra or hexahedra in three dimensions. If the geometry is complex, automatic mesh generation tools are used to facilitate this decomposition <ref> (Lo, 1985, Shep-hard and Georges, 1991) </ref>. A problem with these meshes is that the shape of the elements in the mesh can vary significantly. <p> Some number of sweeps over the adjustable vertices are performed to achieve overall improvement in the mesh. Because the mesh may contain millions of grid points, it is critical that each individual adjustment be com-putationally inexpensive. Perhaps the most commonly used local smoothing technique is Laplacian smoothing <ref> (Lo, 1985, Field, 1988) </ref>. In this method each grid point is moved to the geometric center of the polygon determined by the incident vertices. This method is computationally inexpensive, but operates heuristically and does not guarantee improvement in the element quality.
