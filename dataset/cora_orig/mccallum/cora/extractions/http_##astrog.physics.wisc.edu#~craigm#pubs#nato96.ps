Abstract: of particle acceleration mechanism is indeed occurring (Frail, et al. 1996). Furthermore, previous non-imaging hard X-ray spectra of the Vela X region are power law instead of thermal, with similar photon indices to the ASCA result (Smith & Zimmermann 1985; Pravdo, et al. 1978). These facts push us to consider the strong possibility that the jet is a site of accelerated particles radiating by the synchrotron process. A consistent model explaining the presence of the emission is desirable. A "first draft" of the model might be as follows. The pulsar produces a wind outflow, highly collimated by some mechanism, which emerges along its spin axis. The outflow travels outward until it interacts with the surrounding SNR gas and is shock-accelerated. It seems reasonable to assume that fresh particle acceleration is occurring along the entire length of the jet, since by our estimates the characteristic synchrotron lifetime of the electrons producing 1 keV X-rays is 5000 yr, less than the 10 4 yr age of the SNR. The knotty structure observed along the Vela jet is reminiscent of similar "hot-spot" structures seen in many extragalactic jets, and may reflect similar shock dynamics. The primary surprise from the new ASCA results is that the jet spectrum is lacking emission line features, unless the lines are so severely blended that they form a continuum. Still, at least 50% of the emission appears to be thermal, and the energy flow in the jet remains comparable to the spindown luminosity of the pulsar, indicating that it is connected to an outflow along the rotation axis of the pulsar. With the observation of jet-like signatures associated with this and other pulsars, we suggest that jets may be more ubiquitous than previously imagined and that a search for jets around other pulsars may prove fruitful. 4.
