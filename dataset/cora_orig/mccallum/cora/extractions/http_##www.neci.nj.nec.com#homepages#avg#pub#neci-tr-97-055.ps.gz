Abstract: Technical report # 97-055 NEC Research Institute, Inc. Abstract We introduce a new approach to the maximum flow problem. This approach is based on assigning arc lengths based on the residual flow value and the residual arc capacities. Our approach leads to an O(min(n 2=3 ; m 1=2 )m log( n 2 m ) log U) time bound for a network with n vertices, m arcs, and integral arc capacities in the range [1; : : : ; U ]. This is a fundamental improvement over the previous time bounds. We also improve bounds for the Gomory-Hu tree problem, the parametric flow problem, and the approximate s-t cut problems.

Reference-contexts: A natural variant of this method, the shortest augmenting path algorithm, was shown to be polynomial by Dinitz [14] and Edmonds and Karp [16]. Capacity scaling, developed by Edmonds and Karp [16] and Dinitz [15], also gives polynomial algorithms for the problem. (See also [20].) Classical books <ref> [1, 19] </ref> describe earlier work in detail. Most efficient algorithms for the maximum flow are based on the blocking flow and the push-relabel methods. The first blocking flow algorithm was developed by Dinitz [14] in the framework of the augmenting path approach. <p> Table 1 gives the history of the maximum flow time bounds. We denote the number of vertices in the input network by n and the number of arcs by m. For polynomial algorithms, we assume that arc capacities are integers in the range <ref> [1; : : : ; U ] </ref>. Strongly polynomial algorithms do not need this assumption. We use the similarity assumption of Gabow [20], log U = O (log n), to compare polynomial and strongly polynomial algorithms.
