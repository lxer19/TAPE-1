Title: A compositional treatment of polysemous arguments in Categorial Grammar  
Author: Anne-Marie Mineur Paul Buitelaar 
Abstract: We discuss an extension of the standard logical rules (functional application and abstraction) in Categorial Grammar (CG), in order to deal with some specific cases of polysemy. We borrow from Generative Lexicon theory which proposes the mechanism of coercion, next to a rich nominal lexical semantic structure called qualia structure. In a previous paper we introduced coercion into the framework of sign-based Categorial Grammar and investigated its impact on traditional Fregean compositionality. In this paper we will elaborate on this idea, mostly working towards the introduction of a new semantic dimension. Where in current versions of sign-based Cate-gorial Grammar only two representations are derived: a prosodic one (form) and a logical one (modelling), here we introduce also a more detaled representation of the lexical semantics. This extra knowledge will serve to account for linguistic phenomena like metonymy.

Reference-contexts: By their very nature words adapt to their context. The hearer as well as the speaker use their imagination and select the one aspect of the concept (relating to a particular word) that fits best to the requirements of the situation (see also <ref> (Bartsch 1987) </ref>). In short: polysemy is everywhere. In the following sections we will discuss the systematic nature of this semantic polymorphism, as well as the way in which it interacts with context.

Reference-contexts: This notion of coercion is similar to the original notion of the same name in the context of object-oriented and functional programming languages <ref> (Cardelli and Wegner 1985) </ref>. arguments) and the CG notion of predicate-argument structure, which only accounts for those arguments that are actually realized|logical arguments, in Pustejovsky's terms.

Reference-contexts: intersected with the qualia structure of the NP (fcompany, spokesperson,: : :g), which results in fspokespersong, following spokesperson human. 6 Conclusion The main criticism one may have against our work, is that it introduces a new combinatorial explosion in Categorial Grammar, that already suffers from the problem of spurious ambiguity <ref> (Hendriks 1993) </ref>. A noun may have any finite number of values in its qualia roles, and this may cause computational problems. This is a valid objection. However, what we claim to derive is all the possible readings a sentence could have.

Reference-contexts: In other words: bracketing can be omitted in the prosodics dimension, order is irrelevant for predicate-argument structure. In sign-based Categorial Grammar <ref> (Moortgat 1992, Morrill 1994) </ref>, every lexical entry is represented by a sign that contains two dimensions: prosody and denotational semantics. <p> We want to be able to make a selection, and only use those values that apply in a given context. 5.4 The Calculus We will not go into detail about all the varieties of functional application that occur in the literature. For that we refer the reader to <ref> (Moortgat 1992) </ref> and (Morrill 1994) on Lambek-style Categorial Grammar. What we claim with respect to functional application of a functor to an adjacent argument, may be generalized to any form of adjacent or non-adjacent argument resolution.

Reference-contexts: NP : R:9y:example (y) ^ R (y) a speaker ; S/(NPnS) : P:9x:speaker (x) ^ P (x) Then the representation of (6a) would be derived straightforwardly as (6b). (Albeit with the intervention of some simple meaning postulates to account for the equivalence of a term and its -normal form, see <ref> (Montague 1974) </ref>: (6) a. <p> Number, person, gender and case are typically combinatorially relevant properties. The denotational semantics is in fact the predicate-argument structure of the sentence; the constants that are used are only mnemonic identifiers, as we know them from the Montague-literature <ref> (Montague 1974) </ref>. The prosodic dimension represents word order, and could be extended to represent constituent structure and intonation. Denotational semantics is a standard label in the existing work on sign-based Categorial Grammar. For the sake of simplicity we will omit prosody.

Reference-contexts: That is, if we use all the knowledge that we have available on each of these words. As was mentioned before, meaning is more than an addition of the single atomic senses. The idea of a semantic mismatch is mirrored quite well in the way some semanticists <ref> (e.g., Pollard and Sag 1987) </ref> formulate it: `explain' has not just syntactic expectations considering its arguments, but also expects their meaning to meet certain selection restrictions, see (8).

Reference-contexts: Frequently there is additional information in between the composing parts, which is inferred by heuristic reasoning, e.g., by metonymy as in (1), which has to be interpreted as `John beginning to do something with/to a novel', probably `reading' or `writing' it <ref> (Pustejovsky 1995) </ref>. fl Computational Linguistics, University of the Saarland, Postfach 1150, 66041 Saarbrucken, Germany y Computer Science, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA 02254, USA 1 Although some of the work on meaning postulates developed a more elaborate lexical semantics (Dowty 1979). 1 A compositional treatment of polysemous arguments in CG / 2 <p> To account for this kind of inferences in Categorial Grammar some additions have to be made to its present way of representing word meaning. We borrow from Generative Lexicon theory <ref> (Pustejovsky 1995) </ref> in defining the multiple meanings of a word by the use of a polymorphic representation. Instead of giving a traditional enumeration of word senses, we now relate them to one another into one coherent structure (qualia structure).
