Abstract: In this paper we present an overview of wavelet based multiresolution analyses. First, we briefly discuss the continuous wavelet transform in its simplest form. Then, we give the definition of a multiresolution analysis and show how wavelets fit into it. We take a closer look at orthogonal, biorthogonal and semiorthogonal wavelets. The fast wavelet transform, wavelets on an interval, multidimensional wavelets and wavelet packets are discussed. Several examples of wavelet families are introduced and compared. Finally, the essentials of two major applications are outlined: data compression and compression of linear operators.

Reference-contexts: Let us study this in a little more detail A biorthogonal scaling function and wavelet are semiorthogonal if they generate an orthogonal multiresolution analysis <ref> [1, 2, 20] </ref>. The name pre-wavelet is also used for such a wavelet. <p> A trivial solution could be n;l = f (l=2 n ): Other sampling procedures, such as (quasi-)interpolation and quadrature formulae were proposed in <ref> [1, 2, 85, 120, 128, 138] </ref>. An implementation of a fast wavelet transform in pseudo code is given in the appendix. 10. Examples of wavelets. Now that we have discussed the essentials of wavelet multiresolution analysis, we take a look at some important properties of wavelets. Orthogonality. <p> They also showed that for N going to infinity, the spline wavelets converge to Gabor functions [130]. (iii) Other semiorthogonal wavelets can be found in [89, 109, 110, 113]. A characterization of all semiorthogonal wavelets is given in <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. The properties of some of the orthogonal, biorthogonal and semiorthogonal wave let families are summarized in Table 1. Examples of interpolating scaling functions. (i) The Shannon sampling function ' Shannon = sin (x) ; is an interpolating scaling function. <p> It is band limited, but it has very slow decay. (ii) An interpolating scaling function, whose translates also generate V 0 , can be found by letting b' interpol (!) = b'(!) l ; provided that the denominator does not vanish <ref> [1, 2, 129, 138] </ref>. Even if ' is compactly supported, ' interpol is in general not compactly supported. <p> For many applications, the functions involved are only defined on a compact set, such as an interval or a square, and to apply wavelets then requires some modifications. 11.1. Simple solutions. To be specific, let us discuss the case of the unit interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Given a function f on [0; 1], the most obvious approach is to set f (x) = 0 outside [0; 1], and then use wavelet theory on the line. <p> Simple solutions.

Given a function f on [0; 1], the most obvious approach is to set f (x) = 0 outside [0; 1], and then use wavelet theory on the line. However, for a general function f this "padding with 0s" introduces discontinuities at the endpoints 0 and 1; consider for example the simple function f (x) = 1, x 2 [0; 1]. <p> obvious approach is to set f (x) = 0 outside <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and then use wavelet theory on the line. However, for a general function f this "padding with 0s" introduces discontinuities at the endpoints 0 and 1; consider for example the simple function f (x) = 1, x 2 [0; 1]. Now, as we have said earlier, wavelets are effective for detecting singularities, so artificial ones are likely to introduce significant errors. Another approach, which is often better, is to consider the function to be periodic with period 1, f (x + 1) = f (x). <p> Another approach, which is often better, is to consider the function to be periodic with period 1, f (x + 1) = f (x). Expressed in another way, we assume that the function is defined on the torus and identify the torus with <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Wavelet theory on the torus parallels that on the line. In fact, note that if f has period 1, then the wavelet coefficients on a given scale satisfy h f; j;k i = h f; j;k+2 j i , k 2 Z, j 0. <p> This simple observation readily allows us to rewrite wavelet expansions on the line as analogous ones on the torus, with wavelets defined on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>.

The algorithm in the appendix describes the periodic fast wavelet transform. This "wrap around" procedure is satisfactory in many situations (and certainly takes care of functions like f (x) = 1, x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>). However, unless the behavior of the function f at 0 matches that at 1, the periodic version of f has singularities there. A simple function like f (x) = x, x 2 [0; 1], gives a good illustration of this. <p> in many situations (and certainly takes care of functions like f (x) = 1, x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>).

A simple function like f (x) = x, x 2 [0; 1], gives a good illustration of this. A third method, which works if the basis functions are symmetric, is to use reflection across the edges.

It is also obvious that the functions in f'(x l)j [0;1] : l 2 S j g span V [0;1] j . Here g (x) j [0;1] denotes the restriction of g (x) to [0; 1]. Not quite as obvious is the fact that the functions in this collection are linearly independent, and hence form a basis for V [0;1] j .

In particular, the functions ' j;k , k 2 S (2) j are still pairwise orthogonal. <p> This is easily accomplished with a Gram-Schmidt procedure. Now, if we let W j denote the restriction of functions in W j to <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, then we have that V j+1 = V j + W j :(42) So, the basis elements in V [0;1] j together with the restriction of the wavelets j;k to [0; 1] span V [0;1] j+1 . <p> Now, if we let W j denote the restriction of functions in W j to <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, then we have that V j+1 = V j + W j :(42) So, the basis elements in V [0;1] j together with the restriction of the wavelets j;k to [0; 1] span V [0;1] j+1 . However, there are 2 j + 2N 2 wavelets that intersect [0; 1], and, since dim V [0;1] [0;1] j = 2 j we have too many functions.

However, there are 2 j + 2N 2 wavelets that intersect [0; 1], and, since dim V [0;1] [0;1] j = 2 j we have too many functions. The restrictions of the wavelets in W j that live entirely inside [0; 1] are still mutually orthogonal and, by an observation similar to (41), they are also orthogonal to V [0;1] j . <p> wavelets j;k to <ref> [0; 1] </ref> span V [0;1] j+1 .

The restrictions of the wavelets in W j that live entirely inside [0; 1] are still mutually orthogonal and, by an observation similar to (41), they are also orthogonal to V [0;1] j . There are 2N 2 wavelets whose support intersects an endpoint. However, we only need N 1 basis functions at each endpoint. <p> After that we just apply a Gram-Schmidt procedure again, and we have an orthonormal basis for W [0;1] This elegant construction of Yves Meyer has a couple of disadvantages. Among the functions ' j;k that intersect <ref> [0; 1] </ref> there are some that are almost zero there. <p> Dyadic boundary wavelets. As we noted earlier (33) all polynomials of degree 6 N 1 can be written as linear combinations of the ' j;l for l 2 Z. Hence, the restriction of such polynomials to <ref> [0; 1] </ref> are in V [0;1] j . Since this fact is directly linked to many of the approximation properties of wavelets, any construction of a multiresolution analysis on [0; 1] should preserve this. <p> Hence, the restriction of such polynomials to <ref> [0; 1] </ref> are in V [0;1] j .

The construction in [5, 32, 33] uses this as a starting point and is slightly different from the one by Yves Meyer. Let us briefly describe this construction as well. <p> By (33) and, since the f' j;k g is an orthonormal basis for V j , each monomial x ff , ff 6 N 1, has the representation x ff = P k h x ff ; ' j;k i ' j;k (x).

The remaining 2N functions required for an orthonormal basis of W j , can be found, for example by using (30) again. This last construction carries over to more general situations. For example, we can also use biorthogonal wavelets and much more general closed sets than [0; 1] [5, <p> entirely inside <ref> [0; 1] </ref>.

A simple, but most powerful extension of wavelets and multiresolution analysis are wavelet packets [37, 38].

Data compression. One of the most common applications of wavelet theory is data compression. There are two basic kinds of compression schemes: lossless and lossy.

Since we are going to be brief, let us start by pointing out that more detailed treatments of the continuous wavelet transform can be found in <ref> [20, 77, 78, 83] </ref>. As mentioned above, a wavelet expansion uses translations and dilations of one fixed function, the wavelet 2 L 2 (R). In the case of the continuous wavelet transform, the translation and dilation parameters vary continuously. <p> Let us study this in a little more detail A biorthogonal scaling function and wavelet are semiorthogonal if they generate an orthogonal multiresolution analysis <ref> [1, 2, 20] </ref>. The name pre-wavelet is also used for such a wavelet.

Reference-contexts: One of the standard approaches, not only in Calderon-Zygmund theory, but in analysis in general, is to break up a complicated phenomenon into many simple pieces and study each of the pieces separately. In the 70's, sums of simple functions, called atomic decompositions <ref> [35] </ref>, were widely used, especially in Hardy space theory. One method used to establish that a general function f has such a decomposition, is to start with the "Calderon formula": for a function f , one has that f (x) = 0 1 dt : The fl denotes convolution.

Reference-contexts: With the notion of multiresolution analysis, introduced by Stephane Mallat and Yves Meyer, a systematic framework for understanding these orthogonal expansions was developed [103, 104, 105]. It also provided the connection with quadrature mirror filtering. Soon, Ingrid Daubechies <ref> [47] </ref> gave a construction of wavelets, non-zero only on a finite interval and with arbitrarily high, but fixed, regularity. This takes us up to a fairly recent time in the history of wavelet theory. Several people have made substantial contributions to the field over the past few years. <p> Here we start by defining multiresolution analysis, and then point out some of the connections with the continuous wavelet transform. A multiresolution analysis of L 2 (R) is defined as a sequence of closed subspaces V j of L 2 (R), j 2 Z, with the following properties <ref> [47, 103] </ref>: 1. V j V j+1 , 3. v (x) 2 V 0 , v (x + 1) 2 V 0 , +1 [ V j is dense in L 2 (R) and +1 " V j = f0g, 5. <p> However, there are fast algorithms that use the refinement equation to evaluate the scaling function ' at dyadic points (x = 2 j k, j; k 2 Z) <ref> [15, 18, 47, 52, 53, 122] </ref>. In many applications, we never need the scaling function itself; instead we may often work directly with the h k . 8 BJORN JAWERTH AND WIM SWELDENS The spaces V j will be used to approximate general functions. <p> This yields, at least formally, the product formula b'(!) = j=1 The convergence of this product is examined in <ref> [27, 47] </ref>.

Biorthogonal wavelets. The orthogonality property puts a strong limitation on the construction of wavelets.

The generalization to biorthogonal wavelets has been considered to gain more flexibility. <p> This factorization together with the (bi)orthogonality conditions and the fact that K is a trigonometric polynomial is used as a starting point for the construction of compactly supported wavelets <ref> [31, 47] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This construction, starting from the Daubechies orthogonal or biorthogonal wavelets, yields a family of interpolating functions which had been studied earlier by Gilles Deslauriers and Serge Dubuc in [56, 57]. These functions are smooth and compactly supported. More information can also be found in <ref> [61, 117] </ref>. A natural choice for the wavelet here is (x) = '(2x 1) and this is a typical example of a wavelet with a non-vanishing integral.

Note that we never required the dual scaling function to satisfy a partition of unity property, nor the wavelet to have a vanishing moment. In fact, it is possible to have a wavelet with a non-vanishing integral.

There are interesting results showing that this might be fruitful; for example, it has been shown [17, 46, 111, 140] that for many problems the condition number of the N fi N stiffness matrix remains bounded as the dimension N goes to infinity.

Reference-contexts: This means that we derive an orthogonal wavelet from an orthogonal scaling function by choosing g k = (1) k h 1k :(19) This still leaves us with the problem of constructing a compactly supported scaling function. We will comment on this in Section 8. In <ref> [95] </ref> an orthogonalization procedure to find orthonormal wavelets is proposed. <p> Their Fourier transform is compactly supported. The scaling function and wavelet are symmetric around 0 and 1=2, respectively, and the wavelet has an infinite number of vanishing moments. (iii) The Battle-Lemarie wavelets are constructed by orthogonalizing B-spline functions using (20) and have exponential decay <ref> [12, 95] </ref>. The wavelet with N vanishing moments is a piecewise polynomial of degree N 1 that belongs to C N2 . (iv) Probably the most frequently used orthogonal wavelets are the original Dau-bechies wavelets [47, 49].

AN OVERVIEW OF WAVELET BASED MULTIRESOLUTION ANALYSES 5 Pierre-Gilles Lemarie and Yves Meyer <ref> [97] </ref>, independent of Stromberg, constructed new orthogonal wavelet expansions. With the notion of multiresolution analysis, introduced by Stephane Mallat and Yves Meyer, a systematic framework for understanding these orthogonal expansions was developed [103, 104, 105]. It also provided the connection with quadrature mirror filtering.

Reference-contexts: One of the problems here is, given the scaling function, is there an easy way, cf. (19), to find the wavelets? This was studied in [54, 113, 121]. Another idea is to still try to split into just two subspaces. This involves the use of different lattices <ref> [99] </ref>. In the bivariate case, Ingrid Daubechies and Albert Cohen constructed smooth, compactly supported, biorthogonal wavelets, using ideas from the univariate construction [29]. By now, there is a lot of material about multivariate wavelets.

Reference-contexts: AN OVERVIEW OF WAVELET BASED MULTIRESOLUTION ANALYSES 5 Pierre-Gilles Lemarie and Yves Meyer [97], independent of Stromberg, constructed new orthogonal wavelet expansions. With the notion of multiresolution analysis, introduced by Stephane Mallat and Yves Meyer, a systematic framework for understanding these orthogonal expansions was developed <ref> [103, 104, 105] </ref>. It also provided the connection with quadrature mirror filtering. Soon, Ingrid Daubechies [47] gave a construction of wavelets, non-zero only on a finite interval and with arbitrarily high, but fixed, regularity. This takes us up to a fairly recent time in the history of wavelet theory. <p> Here we start by defining multiresolution analysis, and then point out some of the connections with the continuous wavelet transform. A multiresolution analysis of L 2 (R) is defined as a sequence of closed subspaces V j of L 2 (R), j 2 Z, with the following properties <ref> [47, 103] </ref>: 1. V j V j+1 , 3. v (x) 2 V 0 , v (x + 1) 2 V 0 , +1 [ V j is dense in L 2 (R) and +1 " V j = f0g, 5. <p> The basic behavior of the dual functions is the same. In an approximate sense, this means that the wavelet expansion splits the frequency space into dyadic blocks [2 j ; 2 j+1 ] with j 2 Z <ref> [103, 104] </ref>. In signal processing this idea is known as subband filtering, or, more specifically, as quadrature mirror filtering. Quadrature mirror filters were studied before wavelet theory.
