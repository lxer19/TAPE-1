Reference-contexts: The focus of the Columbia Fast Query Project is to process complex queries efficiently. Ideally, we aim for interactive query response. However, we also aim to improve the performance of noninteractive queries over huge datasets. 2.1 Complex OLAP Query Processing In <ref> [1] </ref> we present the notion of "multi-feature queries." Multi-feature queries succinctly express complex queries such as "Find the total sales among minimum-price suppliers of each item." Such queries need multiple views and/or subqueries in standard SQL.

Reference-contexts: We demonstrate significant performance improvements over a commercial system of a specialized evaluation algorithm for multi-feature queries. In <ref> [2] </ref> we have developed techniques for recognizing when an arbitrary relational query is amenable to the following kind of evaluation strategy: (a) Partition the data according to some attributes, (b) apply a (simpler) query to each partition, and (c) union the results.

Reference-contexts: Our criteria for recognizing such programs are syntactic, and, surprisingly, are nonrestric-tive in the sense that every query that can be evaluated in this partitioned fashion can be expressed in a way that satisfies our criterion. fl Dept. of Electrical Engineering 1 http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kar/fastqueryproj.html In <ref> [3] </ref>, we investigate techniques for evaluating correlated subqueries in SQL. Our techniques apply to all nested subqueries, unlike techniques such as query-rewriting that apply only to a limited class of sub-queries.

Reference-contexts: Integrating this technique into a cost-based optimizer required careful design. Our work was implemented in the Sybase IQ commercial database system, and will be present in their next commercial release. In <ref> [4] </ref> we propose techniques for performing a join of two large relations using a join index. Our techniques are novel in that they require only a single pass of each participating relation, even if both tables are much larger than main memory, with all intermediate I/O performed on tuple identifiers.

Reference-contexts: Our techniques are novel in that they require only a single pass of each participating relation, even if both tables are much larger than main memory, with all intermediate I/O performed on tuple identifiers. This work is extended in <ref> [5] </ref> to perform a self-join of a large relation with a single pass through the relation. A datacube operation computes an aggregate over many different sets of grouping attributes.

Reference-contexts: In particular, for d attributes chosen as possible "dimensions," 2 d aggregates are computed, one for each possible set of dimension attributes. In practice, data is often sparse in the d-dimensional space. We have developed techniques that are particularly efficient for computing the datacube of large, sparse datasets <ref> [6] </ref>. We have also developed novel algorithms to evaluate complex datacube queries involving multiple dependent aggregates at each granularity [7].

We have developed techniques that are particularly efficient for computing the datacube of large, sparse datasets [6]. We have also developed novel algorithms to evaluate complex datacube queries involving multiple dependent aggregates at each granularity <ref> [7] </ref>. Previous techniques asked only simple aggregates (such as sum, max, etc.) at each granularity. 2.2 Materialized Views Materialized views precompute and store expressions that can be used as subexpressions of complex queries. By doing work in advance, one can speed up the process of answering interactive queries.

Sudarshan. </author> <title> Materialized view maintenance and integrity constraint checking: Trading space for time. </title> <booktitle> In Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, </booktitle> <pages> pages 447-458, </pages> <month> June </month> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: By doing work in advance, one can speed up the process of answering interactive queries. An important practical question is choosing which views to materialize. In <ref> [8] </ref> we address this problem, demonstrating that it sometimes pays to materialize additional views just to support the maintenance of a given materialized view.

Reference-contexts: An important practical question is choosing which views to materialize. In [8] we address this problem, demonstrating that it sometimes pays to materialize additional views just to support the maintenance of a given materialized view. In <ref> [9] </ref> we look at the problem of view adaptation, namely how can one incrementally modify a material ized view after a change in the view definition. When one queries multiple materialized views and base tables one would like to see a single consistent database state.

Reference-contexts: When one queries multiple materialized views and base tables one would like to see a single consistent database state. A more general notion of serializabil-ity for accessing both base data and materialized views is presented in <ref> [10] </ref>. Different maintenance policies might be used for performance reasons. For example, deferred maintenance leads to fast base updates but adds overhead to queries; immediate maintenance does the opposite. In [11] we describe how to combine various policies within a single system, and measure the performance of various alternatives.

An approximate answer to a query computed using the summary may be feasible when an exact answer using the full dataset may be infeasible.

A survey of such data reduction techniques is presented in <ref> [13] </ref>. Techniques for visualizing large multidimensional datasets are presented in [14]. Our techniques enable one to visually identify, for any pair of dimensions, regions where the two-dimensional distribution is not explainable as the independent combination of one-dimensional distributions. 3 JAM 2 Faculty: Stolfo.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we must process queries in a way that deals with heterogeneous sources. Our past research focused on processing queries over static document sources. As part of this research, we implemented GlOSS, a scalable system that helps users choose the best sources for their queries <ref> [23, 24, 25] </ref>. One key goal of GlOSS is to scale with large numbers of document sources, for which it keeps succinct descriptions of the source contents. GlOSS needs to extract these content summaries from the sources.

Reference-contexts: There has been substantial progress in developing powerful tools which allow users to specify image queries by giving examples, drawing sketches, selecting visual features (e.g., color and texture), and arranging spatial-temporal structure of features <ref> [27] </ref>. Much success has been achieved, particularly in specific domains, such as sports, remote sensing, and medical applications. New challenges remain in applying the above content-based image search tools to meet real user needs.

Reference-contexts: Local region features (such as color, texture, face, contour, motion) and their spatial/temporal relationships are being used in several innovative image searching systems <ref> [28, 29] </ref>. We argue that the automated segmentation of images/video objects does not need to accurately identify real world objects contained in the imagery. One objective is to extract "salient" visual features and index them with efficient data structures for powerful querying.

Reference-contexts: Today's compression standards (such as JPEG, MPEG-2), are not suited to this need. The objective in the design of these compression standards was to reduce bandwidth and increase subjective quality. Although many interesting analysis and manipulation tasks can still be achieved in today's compression formats <ref> [30] </ref>, the potential functionalities of image search and retrieval were not considered. Recent trends in compression, such as MPEG-4 and object-based video, have shown interest and promise in this direction.

Reference-contexts: For example, the system may model the cases in which low-level feature search tools are successful in finding the images with the desired semantic content.
