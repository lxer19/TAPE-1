Abstract: In this paper we provide a new method for analyzing multidimensional filter banks. This method enables us to solve various open problems in multidimensional filter bank characterization and design. The essential element in this new approach is the redefinition of polyphase components. It will be shown that a rich set of mathematical tools, in particular algebraic group theory, will become available for use in the analysis of filter banks. We demonstrate the elegance and power of the tool set by employing it for the characterization of multidimensional filter banks, and by applying it to two open problems. The first problem is concerned with the development of a general method to design multichannel ( 2) multidimensional filter banks using transformations, while the second problem is concerned with the derivation of general restrictions on group delays in linear phase filter banks. The treatment of these problems is only an illustration of the power of the tool set of algebraic group theory, employed for the first time in the context of multidimensional filter banks.

Definition 1: The set W (L) of frequency cosets is defined by The following theorem summarizes the important properties of frequency cosets (see <ref> [9] </ref> [10]). Theorem 2: Let L be a generating matrix for L and let M be the lattice generated by L t . Then the following as sertions hold: 1. <p> There is however a even more tight relationship.

Reference-contexts: The most well known example of such a technique for designing filter banks is the McClellan transform. Originally the McClellan transform was developed as a technique for designing multidimensional filters (see <ref> [12] </ref>), but it been extended to the design of multidimensional filter banks. In particular, conditions have been derived such that a 1D, 2-channel, PR filter bank is transformed into a multidimensional, 2-channel, PR filter bank [17] [19] [18] [26]. <p> In general K (z) is chosen such that the filter ~ F (K (z)) (where, as earlier, F (z) is the low-pass analysis filter) has prescribed frequency characteristics (see <ref> [12] </ref>). Let ^ F be the filter bank derived from ~ F by transforming with K (z). Then again applying Theorem 6, we find that ^ F is bi-orthogonal. Summarizing we have found the following Theorem, generalizing a result from [18].

As we use a slightly different definition of polyphase components as found in the literature (see <ref> [20] </ref>) we will state our definition explicitly. The main difference with the well-established definition of [20] lies in the fact that we retain the zero-valued points.

Reference-contexts: The question which we will address in this section is: How are d, *(F) and o (F) related to the sampling lattice L? In the 1D case, this question has already been studied in [27] and <ref> [28] </ref>, and the answer is part of the signal processing folklore.
