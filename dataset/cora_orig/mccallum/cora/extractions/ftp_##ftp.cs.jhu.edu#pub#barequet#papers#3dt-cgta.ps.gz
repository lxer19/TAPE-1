Title: On Triangulating Three-Dimensional Polygons  
Author: Gill Barequet Matthew Dickerson David Eppstein 
Keyword: Three-dimensions, triangulation.  
Abstract: A three-dimensional polygon is triangulable if it has a non-self-intersecting triangulation which defines a simply-connected 2-manifold. We show that the problem of deciding whether a 3-dimensional polygon is triangulable is N P-Complete. We then establish some necessary conditions and some sufficient conditions for a polygon to be triangulable, providing special cases when the decision problem may be answered in polynomial time.

Reference-contexts: Since a compound of knots is always itself knotted <ref> [1, pp. 9 and 104] </ref> 2 and knots cannot be triangulated (see Section 3.1), such a diagonal cannot be part of any triangulation of the input, so any triangulation of the input must triangulate each polygon independently, in roughly the same shape as a triangulation of the original generalized triangulation problem. <p> this result to Schubert [16]. 8 P 2 P 4 P 1 P 1 P 3 P 5 P 1 P 3 P 5 P 3 P 4 (c) (d) 3.2 Unknotted Polygons A known result in knot theory states that all k-gons with k 5 are unknotted (see, e.g., <ref> [1, x1.6] </ref>). We prove a slightly stronger claim: Theorem 5 Every 3-dimensional triangle, quadrilateral, or pentagon, is triangulable. Proof: A triangle in 3-space is the triangulation of itself.

Reference-contexts: The surface-reconstruction algorithm of Barequet and Sharir [3] computes (as a subprob-lem) optimal (minimum-area) triangulations of 3-dimensional biplanar polygons.

If we allow self-intersecting triangulations (in contrast with our definition), then computing the optimal triangulation can be done (in cubic time) by applying a simple dynamic-programming procedure (see <ref> [2, 3] </ref>). In this paper we address several problems related to 3-dimensional polygons. Specifically, we prove that the triangulability of a polygon in 3-space is N P-Complete.

Reference-contexts: We are not aware of previous work on the triangulation of 3-dimensional polygons. However special cases of this problem arise in various contexts, in which the problem is to compute an unknown (polyhedral) surface when only its (polygonal) boundary is known. The surface-reconstruction algorithm of Barequet and Sharir <ref> [3] </ref> computes (as a subprob-lem) optimal (minimum-area) triangulations of 3-dimensional biplanar polygons. This algorithm has applications to medical imaging and to the reconstruction of topographic terrains. Several algorithms for repairing CAD objects [2, 5, 14] use 3-dimensional triangulation procedures for filling cracks in polyhedral surfaces. <p> This goal is naturally more ambitious than computing any valid triangulation or just determining triangulability. If we allow self-intersecting triangulations (in contrast with our definition), then computing the optimal triangulation can be done (in cubic time) by applying a simple dynamic-programming procedure (see <ref> [2, 3] </ref>). In this paper we address several problems related to 3-dimensional polygons. Specifically, we prove that the triangulability of a polygon in 3-space is N P-Complete. <p> A biplanar polygon is a 3-dimensional polygon whose vertices lie in two parallel planes. The number of edges that connect ("jump") between the two planes is not limited. Computing a triangulation of biplanar polygons appears, for example, in interpolation problems (see, e.g., <ref> [3] </ref> 3 ). Unfortunately, biplanarity (even of an unknotted polygon) is not a sufficient condition for triangulability. The hexagon shown in Figure 5 is an unknotted biplanar polygon which is not triangulable. <p> The common aspect of all the presented conditions is the simplicity of some projection of the polygon. Unfortunately, it is fairly easy to show that none of them is a necessary condition. 3 Note that the 3-dimensional polygons of <ref> [3] </ref>, so-called clefts, always have simple orthogonal projections, hence they are triangulable. 4 Snoeyink refers to unknotted polygons as "trivial knots". 11 3.3.1 Simple Orthogonal Projection Theorem 7 If the orthogonal projection of a 3-dimensional polygon P onto some plane Q is simple, then P is triangulable.

Reference-contexts: A 3-dimensional polygon need not be planar, nor triangulable. In this paper we investigate the triangulability of 3-dimensional polygons.

The triangulation of a planar polygon attracted considerable attention in the literature during the past decade.

The complexity of triangulating a planar polygon was an open problem in computational geometry until Chazelle [7] closed the issue by presenting an ingenious optimal fi (n) algorithm. <p> A more general question is: if a 3-dimensional polygon is triangulable, how many triangulations are there? If we neglect the possible intersections between triangles in 3-space, then the number of triangulations of an n-gon identifies with that of a planar convex polygon: 1 n1 2n4 <ref> [8, p. 76] </ref>. This is, in fact, the (n 2)th Catalan number. In general, however, computing the number of valid (non-self-intersecting) triangulations of a 3-dimensional polygon is a non-trivial problem. This leads to another interesting problem which is to compute an optimal triangulation for some measure of optimality.

Reference-contexts: By splitting all the quadrilaterals and the target rectangle into two triangles each, we obtain the triangles-cover-triangle problem which belongs to the collection of so-called 3SUM-Hard problems [11].

A standard plane-sweep procedure requires O (n 4 log n) time. However, constructing the whole arrangement of fi (n 2 ) quadrilaterals can be done in O (n 4 ) time by using topological sweeping <ref> [9] </ref>. To conclude, the whole algorithm runs in O (n 4 ) time in the worst case. 6 The space complexity of the algorithm is fi (n 2 ). 4.1.5 Remarks First, we note that the bottleneck of our algorithm is the topological sweeping of the arrangement.

Second, the existence of a simple orthogonal projection of P implies only its trian-gulability.

(Tetrahedralization of three-dimensional polyhedra is also known to be N P-Complete <ref> [15] </ref>.) The problem is obviously in N P: testing whether two 3-dimensional triangles (whose vertices have integer coordinates) intersect can be performed in time polynomial in the bit complexity of the coordinates, 1 and checking whether a given candidate solution (a triangulation of a polygon P ) does not intersect itself
