Title: A GRADUAL INTEGRATION OF OODBMS TO LEGACY TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS

Abstract: Systems that use both relational and objectoriented databases complicate the process of estimating overall system performances. Our goal in Nokia Research Center is to try to evaluate the utilization of OODBMS as a performance booster for applications currently based on relational databases.

Reference-contexts: We have started with a public benchmark OO7 [CDN93] and then implemented our own more specific benchmark. The "goodness" of benchmarks is determined by it proximity to real applications. As benchmarks evolve to cover more application domains <ref> [CDKN94] </ref> a similar effort should be devoted to covering recurring architectures. These architectures share similar characteristics and can be found in many application domains. One such architecture is integrated legacy system where relational and object oriented databases cooperate inside one application.

Reference-contexts: The implementation will give us more detailed data on the expected performances of complete OODBMS integration. Benchmarking During the early stages of the project, benchmarks were used for acquiring hands-on experience with OODBMS products. We have started with a public benchmark OO7 <ref> [CDN93] </ref> and then implemented our own more specific benchmark. The "goodness" of benchmarks is determined by it proximity to real applications. As benchmarks evolve to cover more application domains [CDKN94] a similar effort should be devoted to covering recurring architectures.

Reference-contexts: Introduction It has been shown that OODBMS can perform better than relational databases in certain cases <ref> [DD88] </ref>. Such results were our motivation for evaluating the relevance of OODBMS products to our network management systems. Typically those systems already use to some extent objectoriented techniques through the use of OOA/OOD methodology and/or objectoriented languages.

Reference-contexts: These architectures share similar characteristics and can be found in many application domains. One such architecture is integrated legacy system where relational and object oriented databases cooperate inside one application. Some worry that OODBMS vendors will put a special effort into tuning their products to obtain good benchmark results <ref> [Gra93] </ref>. While this phenomenon has its negative side one must also consider the positive side, tuning a product towards a "good" benchmark might also have a good impact on the applications targeted by the benchmark.

Reference-contexts: The difference is due to overheads such as the costs associated with managing the same data simultaneously on two databases and with complying to existing interfaces. The activity of integrating OODBMS to legacy systems is common ([JL91], <ref> [SZ87] </ref>). The success of such integration will be measured mainly by the total gain of performance. Discussing the limitations and constraints of such systems, and maybe constructing an adequate benchmark will help to achieve a successful integration, and will be beneficial to all those who are engaged in such activities.
