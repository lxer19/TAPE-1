Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with the problem of determining the potential for load balancing in a distributed computing system. We define a precise measure, called the number of sharable jobs, of this potential in terms of the number of jobs that can usefully be transferred across sites in the system. Properties of this measure are derived, including a general formula for its probability distribution, independent of any particular queuing discipline. A normalized version of the number of sharable jobs, called the job sharing coefficient, is defined. From the general formula, the probability distribution of the number of sharable jobs is computed for three important queuing models and exact expressions are derived in two cases. For queuing models in which an exact expression for the probability distribution of the number of sharable jobs is difficult to obtain, two methods are presented for numerical computation of this distribution. The job sharing coefficient is plotted against traffic intensity for various values of system parameters. Both of these measures are shown to be useful analytic tools for understanding the characteristics of load sharing in distributed systems. They can also aid in the design of such systems.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the queue size distribution is given by the following expressions <ref> [2] </ref>. P-Q = 0- = (1 - r) r P-Q = n- = (1 - r)(e + (-1) k=1 e n-k + n-k-1 ) for n 2 The complex form of P-Q = n-, n 2, causes the computation of the expression in Theorem 1 (b) to be intractable. <p> The number of jobs arriving at a particular time, called the bulksize random variable, is a discrete non-negative random variable. A common model for bulksize distribution is the Geometric distribution <ref> [2] </ref>. In addition to arrival rate, l, and service rate, m, an M X /M/1 queue requires a third parameter, a, to describe the Geometric distribution of bulk size. <p> The first two are usually replaced by their ratio l /m , denoted by r, as in the case of the M/M/1 queue. The queue size distribution for an M X /M/1 queue is given by the following <ref> [2] </ref>. P-Q = 0- = 1 - r n-1 In this case, we were able to obtain an exact expression for the distribution of G, as follows. 23 Let us define b = a + (1 - a)r.

Reference-contexts: Each of these are sums of independent identically distributed random variables. Hence their distributions can, in principle, be computed using a number of methods including the well known transform methods <ref> [3] </ref>. If exact expressions prove hard to derive, numerical methods can be used to compute and to invert these transforms. From Theorem 1, we can obtain the expectation of the random variable G as a finite sum. <p> Three transform methods are commonly available in the context of probability distributions. These are z-transform, Laplace Transform, and Fourier Transform (also known as the characteristic function) <ref> [3] </ref>. Here, we shall describe the use of z-transforms. The other transforms can also be used likewise. Given a function p n , defined on the non-negative integers, its z-transform [3] is the function f [z] = p n z n=0 If p n is the probability distribution of a discrete <p> These are z-transform, Laplace Transform, and Fourier Transform (also known as the characteristic function) <ref> [3] </ref>. Here, we shall describe the use of z-transforms. The other transforms can also be used likewise. Given a function p n , defined on the non-negative integers, its z-transform [3] is the function f [z] = p n z n=0 If p n is the probability distribution of a discrete non-negative random variable X, then the z - transform of the sum of I independent instances of X is simply the Ith power of f [z]. <p> The M/M/1 queue is a well known model for queues. Let random variable Q denote the M/M/1 queue size at a site and r denote the traffic intensity. For clarity we shall omit subscripts (denoting sites) in the following analysis wherever there is no confusion. We have <ref> [3] </ref>, P-Q = x - = (1 - r) r x , x = 0,1,2,.... Using this expression for the queue size distribution, we obtain the following expressions. P UL = 1 - r L . <p> Thus the above formula for P-G k- can be used to compute EG. 5.1.3 Computation of the Job Sharing Coefficient To compute the Job Sharing Coefficient, J c, we recall <ref> [3] </ref> that the expectation of the queue size distribution of the M/M/1 queue is r/(1 - r). For various combinations of values of N, L, and 21 H, EG was computed as described in Section 5.1.2. <p> Using Little's Law <ref> [3] </ref>, we obtain EQ = l W = 2m (1 - r) r 2 (1 - r) 22 Using this expression and EG values as computed in Section 5.2, J c can be calculated from Definition 13.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction In a distributed system, statistical fluctuations in arrival and service patterns across the various sites cause imbalances in load where one or more sites may be operating much below capacity and others may simultaneously be overloaded. Livny and Melman <ref> [4] </ref> showed that in a distributed system consisting of homogeneous sites, there is a high probability that a site is idle while jobs are queued up for service at another.

Reference-contexts: S j J j=1 + J (H + 1) JH + k- = P- Q j J Since the Q j above are independent Geometrically distributed random variables each with parameter r, the sum of J of these is distributed as a Negative Binomial random variable with parameters (J, r) <ref> [5 ] </ref>. Thus, the above probability is given by the following expression.

Reference-contexts: Over the last several years, a number of load balancing algorithms has been proposed. Shivaratri, Krueger, and Singhal [8] provide a survey and taxonomy of load sharing algorithms. Recently, Rommel <ref> [6] </ref> extended the Livny-Melman result for a generalized definition of overloaded and underloaded sites and computed the probability that at least one site is overloaded while at least one other site is underloaded, for several service time distributions. This probability is called the Probability of Load Balancing Success (PLBS). <p> Thus G represents the maximum number of jobs that can be usefully transferred in the system. There is no point in trying to transfer a greater number of jobs than G because there will not be any underloaded sites available to accept these excess jobs. In <ref> [6] </ref> Rommel computes the probability that G &gt; 0, and calls it the Probability of Load Balancing Success (PLBS). Here we shall derive a general expression for the distribution of G. This expression gives much better insight into the potential for load balancing. <p> These observations illustrate that the nonlinearity of both EG and EQ results in somewhat unexpected phenomena especially when the number of sharable jobs is potentially large. 6.3 Comparison with Previous Work It is interesting to compare our numerical results with those of Rommel <ref> [6] </ref>, especially for the larger value of N. Since Rommel plots the Probability of Load Balancing Success (PLBS) versus traffic intensity while we plot the mean number of jobs that can usefully be shared, these two are not directly comparable.

Reference-contexts: Method 2 described in Section 4.2 was used to compute approximations to EG for various parameter values. 5.2.1 Computation of Job Sharing Coefficient From <ref> [7] </ref>, we obtain that the average waiting time in M/D/1 queue is given by W = 2m (1 - r) , where m is the service rate.
