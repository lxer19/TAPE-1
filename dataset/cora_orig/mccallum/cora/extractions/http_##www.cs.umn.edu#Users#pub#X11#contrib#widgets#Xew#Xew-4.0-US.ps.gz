Reference-contexts: The purpose of this document is to specify and describe a sample implementation of a basic multimedia widget set for X Window system to be used in presenting the information formats specified in the companion document Interchange Formats <ref> [1] </ref>. Each main category (Text, Images, Graphics, Audio, Video) will have own widget class.

Reference-contexts: This should be used by the application when the layout information generated by the layoutCallback functions is changed. 3.7 Supported control sequences within the text content The supported control functions serve two different purposes: first the code extension techniques defined by ISO 2022 <ref> [2] </ref> are fully implemented, and secondly a selected subset of the ISO 6429 [3] control sequences are supported. Both 7-bit and 8-bit forms are supported equally. ISO 6429 (ANSI X3.64) Support The control sequences from ISO 6429 presented below can be used within the text content.

Reference-contexts: The following values are possible: XeAlignment_START, XeAlignment_END, XeAlignment_CENTER and XeAlignment_JUSTIFIED. These have the same semantics as the alignment attribute in ODA <ref> [4] </ref> standard. The XeAlignment enumeration defines these and some other values. a. N in this column indicates that the support for the resource has not yet been implemented. (N) indicates partial implementation in some widget classes. <p> EuroBridge Document Number EB/IREP/VTT/010/HPage 36 EuroBridge Widget Set lineLayoutTable is a pointer to an array of tabulation stop definitions. The end of the array is indicated by an element having a negative value in the reference field. typedef XeTabStop - int reference; int position; int alignment; char alignment_string <ref> [4] </ref>; - XeTabStop; The widget does not make a private copy of this resource value. The pointer is used and it must remain valid until new value is set or the widget is destroyed. <p> The tabulation positions are defined through lineLayoutTable resource. The semantics of this are taken directly from ISO 8613-6 <ref> [4] </ref>. ISO 2022 Code Extension support The text content implementation of code extension follows the 8-bit environment specified in ISO 2022. The 7-bit environment is a subset of this and is supported implicitly. <p> The resource value is a structure defined as: typedef enum - XeBorderType_INVISIBLE, XeBorderType_SOLID, XeBorderType_DASHED, XeBorderType_DOT, XeBorderType_DASH_DOT, XeBorderType_DASH_DOT_DOT, XeBorderType_SHADOW - XeBorderType; typedef struct XeFrameBorder - XeBorderType type;/* Border type selection */ int width; /* Width of the border */ int space; /* free space */ unsigned char color <ref> [4] </ref>; /* Border color (RGB), is ** specified if the 4th byte ** is set non-zero. */ - XeFrameBorder; The 3d shadow border is a quick add-on which does not work properly with the other renditions. XeBorderType_SHADOW should be specified to all four edges, if used.
