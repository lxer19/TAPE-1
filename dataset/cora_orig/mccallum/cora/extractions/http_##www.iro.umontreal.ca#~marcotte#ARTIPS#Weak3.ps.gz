Reference-contexts: To this aim, they introduced the notion of a weak sharp minimum, which extends the notion of a sharp or strongly unique minimum to mathematical programs admitting non isolated local minima. In our work, we extend their results and those of Al-Khayyal and Kyparisis <ref> [1] </ref> to generalized monotone variational inequalities, and provide a characterization of their solution sets. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the main definitions. <p> The first such result generalizes a result of Al-Khayyal and Kyparisis <ref> [1] </ref> to the case where the solution set is not necessarily a singleton. Theorem 5 Let F be continuous and pseudomonotone + over the set X, and let the solution set X fl of VIP be weakly sharp. Let also fx k g be a sequence in R n .

Reference-contexts: The proof of this result is identical to that given in Auslender <ref> [2] </ref> for monotone variational inequalities. Note that we cannot substitute quasimonotonicity for pseudomonotonicity in (13), as shown by the VIP involving the quasimonotone function F (x) = x 2 and the set X = R.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently, Burke and Ferris <ref> [5] </ref> have introduced sufficient conditions for the finite identification, by iterative algorithms, of local minima associated with mathematical programs. To this aim, they introduced the notion of a weak sharp minimum, which extends the notion of a sharp or strongly unique minimum to mathematical programs admitting non isolated local minima. <p> Thus, G is continuously differentiable at every point x fl 2 X fl , with gradient rG (x fl ) = F (x fl ): 2 4 Sharp solutions of variational inequalities Recently, in the context of convex smooth optimization, Burke and Ferris <ref> [5] </ref> have extended the notion of a strongly unique solution to optimization problems whose solution set is not necessarily a singleton. To this aim, they introduced the notion of a weak sharp solution for a convex minimization problem. <p> is still valid for every x fl 2 X fl , and we obtain the result as a consequence of the convergence of the sequence fkF (x k ) F (x fl )kg k to zero. 2 If is a nonempty, closed and convex subset of X, Burke and Ferris <ref> [5] </ref> have proved the inclusion + x2 [ [x + N X (x)]: (32) We will now use this result to provide a geometric characterization of sequences that achieve the finite identification of a solution to VIP.

Reference-contexts: Proof The `if' part of the statement is a consequence of Theorem 3. To prove the converse, first observe that the solution set (x fl ) = X fl of the linear program: min hF (x fl ); xi is weakly sharp (see appendix in Mangasarian and Meyer <ref> [10] </ref> for instance), with positive modulus ff, and that ff only depends on the constant vector F (x fl ) and X.
