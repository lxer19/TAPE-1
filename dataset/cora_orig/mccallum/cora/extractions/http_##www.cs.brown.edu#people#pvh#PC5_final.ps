Abstract: In this paper, we study constraint satisfaction over connected row convex (CRC) constraints, a large class of constraints subsuming, in particular, monotone constraints. We first show that CRC constraints are closed under composition, intersection, and transposition, the basic operations of path-consistency algorithms. This establishes that path consistency over CRC constraints produces a minimal and decomposable network, strenghtening the results of van Beek and Dechter [ 1995 ] . We then present a path-consistency algorithm for CRC constraints running in time O(n 3 d 2 ) and space O(n 2 d), where n is the number of variables and d is the size of the largest domain. This improves the traditional time complexity O(n 3 d 3 ) and space complexity O(n 3 d 2 ). Finally, we show that a solution can be found in time O(n 2 ), once the graph is path-consistent.

Reference-contexts: A decomposable graph is also called strongly n-consistent <ref> [ Freuder, 1982 ] </ref> . Decomposable graphs have thus the property that any consistent instantiation of some variables can be extended to a solution without backtracking. A decomposable graph is of course minimal.

Reference-contexts: The above theorem is valid for incomplete graphs of CRC constraints as well, since the completion of the graph introduces TRUE constraints which are CRC. Finding a Solution A path-consistent graph with CRC constraints is decomposable due to Helly's theorem (e.g., <ref> [ Haroud and Faltings, 1996 ] </ref> ). The proof in [ van Beek and Dechter, 1995 ] is constructive and the author proposes a O (n 2 d) algorithm to find a solution.
