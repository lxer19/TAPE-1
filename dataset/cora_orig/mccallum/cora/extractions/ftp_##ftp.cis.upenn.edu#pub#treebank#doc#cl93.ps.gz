Reference-contexts: The pioneering Brown Corpus distinguishes 87 simple tags ([Francis 1964]), <ref> [Francis and Kucera 1982] </ref>) and allows the formation of compound tags; thus, the contraction I 'm is tagged as PPSS+BEM (PPSS for "non-3rd person nominative personal pronoun" and BEM for "am, 'm". 3 Subsequent projects have tended to elaborate the Brown Corpus tagset.

Reference-contexts: The Brown Corpus further distinguishes three forms 3 Counting both simple and compound tags, the Brown Corpus tagset contains 187 tags. 4 A useful overview of the relation of these and other tagsets to each other and to the Brown Corpus tagset is given in Appendix B of <ref> [Garside et al 1987] </ref>. 2 of d o|the base form (DO), the past tense (DOD), and the third person singular present (DOZ), 5 and eight forms of be|the five forms distinguished for regular verbs as well as the irregular forms am (BEM), are (BER) and w as (BEDZ).

Reference-contexts: Fidditch, a deterministic parser developed by Donald Hindle first at the University of Pennsylvania and subsequently at AT&T Bell Labs ([Hindle 1983], <ref> [Hindle 1989] </ref>), is used to provide an initial parse of the material. Annotators then hand correct the parser's output using a mouse-based interface implemented in GNU Emacs Lisp.

Reference-contexts: The POS-tagged corpus has also been used to train a number of different POS taggers including <ref> [Meteer et al 1991] </ref>, and the skeletally parsed corpus has been used in connection with the development of new methods to exploit intonational cues in disambiguating the parsing of spoken sentences ([Veilleux and Ostendorf 1992]).

Reference-contexts: The Penn Treebank has been used to bootstrap the development of lexicons for particular applications (Robert Ingria, personal communication) and is being used as a source of examples for linguistic theory and psychological modelling (e.g. <ref> [Niv 1991] </ref>). To aid in the search for specific examples of grammatical phenomena using the Treebank, Richard Pito has developed tgrep, a tool for very fast context-free pattern matching against the skeletally parsed corpus, which is available through the Linguistic Data Consortium.
