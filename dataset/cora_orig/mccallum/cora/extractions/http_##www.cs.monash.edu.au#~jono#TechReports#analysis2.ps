Abstract: The doomsday argument purports to show that starting solely from the information of what your birth rank is amongst some population the extinction of that population is near at hand, or at any rate significantly nearer than you had previously supposed. Various authors have suggested that this is a straightforward consequence of Bayesian reasoning. We show that Bayesian reasoning is both more subtle and more plausible than the doomsdayers' understanding of it.

Reference-contexts: To do this, we first need a prior probability distribution over N . Following other commentators, we shall adopt a uniform prior distribution over N in the range <ref> [1; U ] </ref>. Although this is not a realistic assumption, it will allow us to assess readily whether or not the dramatic shift in the probability distribution, claimed by doomsdayers, is in the offing. <p> For example, Leslie [8, pp. 86-7] claims that "[the doomsday calculations] suggest rather strongly that the risk of Quick Doom is usually under-estimated and that we at least have little ground for thinking that a long-lasting human race is proba ble." In a similar vein, Bostrom <ref> [1] </ref> claims that "by Bayes' theorem, you should update your beliefs about mankind's prospects and realise that an impending doomsday is much more probable than you have hitherto thought." However, Table 1 and Figure 3 show that if there has been an underestimation of Quick Doom, it has been a minor

Reference-contexts: Still, John Leslie's version of the doomsday argument appears to avoid any trouble here. Leslie emphasizes the first-person perspective in his version of the Argument. After all, the doomsday argument historically developed out of Brandon Carter's anthropic principle <ref> [2] </ref>, and much of the point there was that reflexive observations about ourselves observing the universe have interesting inferential implications. The DA came from an attempt to apply such reflexive considerations to our collective lifespan.

Reference-contexts: In the form in which the argument has been presented in the literature the doomsday argument requires the following two assumptions: * we consider two competing hypothesis [8, p. 86] <ref> [3, p. 78] </ref>, namely Quick Doom (QD) and Doom Deferred (DD). 1 A person's birth rank is the position in the birth order, numbered consecutively of all people who will ever be. 1 * we will make inferences under the Human Randomness (HR) assumption [4, p. 248]: "We can validly consider <p> Whereas those authors have taken this as a simplifying assumption that helps to set out the inferential matters at stake clearly (e.g., [8, p. 86] <ref> [3, p. 78] </ref>), we believe instead that it distorts the problem, leading to serious misunderstandings of it.

Reference-contexts: two competing hypothesis [8, p. 86] [3, p. 78], namely Quick Doom (QD) and Doom Deferred (DD). 1 A person's birth rank is the position in the birth order, numbered consecutively of all people who will ever be. 1 * we will make inferences under the Human Randomness (HR) assumption <ref> [4, p. 248] </ref>: "We can validly consider our birth rank as generated by random or equiprobable sampling from the collection of all persons who ever live." Let N be the total number of people who will ever be, and let R be our birth rank. <p> Indeed, without specific argument constraining the size of our hypothesis space, Figure 3 shows that we can expand the expected size of the population arbitrarily, simply by adopting larger hypothesis spaces. Again, Eckhardt <ref> [4, p. 248] </ref> asserts (in an article attempting to rebut the doomsday argument): "When correct allowance is made for the randomness assumption, doomsday reasoning has an unalterable bias towards earlier doom. <p> by our uncertainties about what prior hypotheses to consider. 3 Human Randomness Although we believe the above probabilistic considerations take all of the sting out of the doomsday argument, the second major assumption of that argument can also be questioned | and indeed it has been questioned by both Eckhardt <ref> [4] </ref> and us [7]. First, it is clear that there is in fact no physically uniform selection process yielding the rank evidence at hand. Birth is a causal process and might be construed as a selection process. <p> Setting selection biases aside, there is an additional difficulty, or at least oddity, with the use of HR in the doomsday argument. As Eckhardt points out <ref> [4, p. 257] </ref>, a physically random uniform selection process over one class (say, humans), cannot simultaneously be a physically random uniform selection process over a distinct class (say, mammals), since the probability of uniform selections in two distinct classes cannot both sum to one. 4 Nor is this point restricted to

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The doomsday argument (DA) <ref> [8, 6, 9] </ref> claims that starting solely from the information of what your birth rank 1 is we should prefer the hypothesis that the extinction of humanity is near rather than remote. <p> his treatment of the doomsday argument, John Leslie repeatedly asserts that the point of the doomsday argument is not specifically that Doom is near at hand, but rather that whatever the probability of Quick Doom was prior to considering the argument, that probability is substantially greater after considering the argument <ref> [9, p. 204 and p. 213] </ref>. The point of the argument is to induce a probability shift in favor of quick extinction, a shift which operates regardless of the available evidence concerning the lifetime of the population (and hence is a priori).

Reference-contexts: However, it is generally accepted that an epistemic direct inference is defeated if biasing prior knowledge is available (see, for example, <ref> [11] </ref>). Unfortunately for Leslie's version of the doomsday argument, all his empirical evidence of a near-term Doom tends to support the assertion that our birth ranks are biased towards being late in the total ordering of births.
