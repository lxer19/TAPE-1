Abstract: In order to perform efficient, robust planetary exploration with robotic systems that use manipulation during science experiments, we will be increasingly reliant on vehicle-based autonomous and semi-autonomous control modalities. Planned lander and rover missions to Mars will require manipulative capabilities for placing science equipment and acquiring geological samples. As an Earth-based operator can only communicate with the system periodically and therefore is limited to making only high level commands, we must rely on local autonomies in the system to intelligently carry out the desired actions. This paper describes an experimental system and ongoing research for developing strategies for autonomous behavior mediated by humans at a great distance. This paper is not intended to present any one aspect of our work in a highly theoretical or rigorous way; rather we give an overview of our work and communicate insights into the challenges we have faced over the past few years.
