Abstract: One of the most important aspects in service robotics is the communication of service robots with their users. Since these users must in general be considered as not familiar with either robots or computers, this communication must take place in a human-oriented manner and employ human-understandable symbols. Here, two techniques relying heavily on learning mechanisms are presented that facilitate this kind of communication: Programming by Demonstration enables the user to easily communicate action and world knowledge to the robot. Operational Concepts support this task, but they can as well be used by the robot itself in order to communicate its own knowledge to the user in an understandable way.

Reference-contexts: Robot manufacturers all over the world are expecting to open a new, consumer-oriented market that will allow for sales figures far beyond those that can be obtained from today's industrial robots. In areas such as service and personal assistance, mobile robots are expected to create these rapidly growing markets <ref> [1, 8] </ref>. However, the use of robots in a personal environment is not straightforward. Today's mobile service robots rely on a very limited set of commands such as move forward and turn left and do not have to communicate extensively with their users.

Reference-contexts: On the task level, demonstrations result in reusable programs that are built on the base of a well-defined set of elementary robot skills <ref> [2] </ref>, such as approach door ! move through door ! : : : ! dock On the skill level, control functions performing perception-action transformations can be learned from user demonstrations in order to actually realize a skill [5].

Reference-contexts: Secondly, to allow the user to efficiently control and maintain the robot, the low-level numerical representations used by the robot have to be translated into an understandable form. Both aspects are related to the problem of symbol grounding <ref> [3] </ref>. Fig. 1. Human-Robot Interaction in the context of personal service robots.

Reference-contexts: On both levels, the human teacher cannot be expected to demonstrate an optimal solution of the task at hand, so adaptation must be considered <ref> [4] </ref>.
