Reference-contexts: Flow Controller, 12/23/81 The MFM is similar in function to the LSI guard being developed by I. P. Sharp <ref> [Craigen 82] </ref>. The key difference is that the LSI guard is intended to review and sanitize messages manually. An attempt was made to design a high level flow controller system that could be refined into either the LSI guard or the MFM.
