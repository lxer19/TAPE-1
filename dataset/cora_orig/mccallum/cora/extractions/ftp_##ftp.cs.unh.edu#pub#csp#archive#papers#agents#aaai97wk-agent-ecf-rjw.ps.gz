Title: Suggestion Strategies for Constraint-Based Matchmaker Agents

Abstract: In this paper we describe a paradigm for content-focused matchmaking, based on a recently proposed model for constraint acquisition-and-satisfaction. Matchmaking agents are conceived as constraint-based solvers that interact with other, possibly human, agents (Clients or Customers). The Matchmaker provides potential solutions ("suggestions") based on partial knowledge, while gaining further information about the problem itself from the other agent through the latter's evaluation of these suggestions. The dialog between Matchmaker and Customer results in iterative improvement of solution quality, as demonstrated in simple simulations. We also show empirically that this paradigm supports "suggestion strategies" for finding acceptable solutions more efficiently or for increasing the amount of information obtained from the Customer. This work also indicates some ways in which the tradeoff between these two metrics for evaluating performance can be handled.

Reference-contexts: Repeating the cycle of suggestion and correction allows the Matchmaker to improve its picture of the Customer's problem until a suggestion constitutes a satisfactory solution. The problem of both acquiring and solving a CSP has been termed the "constraint acquisition and satisfaction problem" (CASP) in <ref> (Freuder 1995) </ref>, where the basic suggestion/correction model was suggested but not imple mented. The constraint network representation supports the computation of suggestions and easily incorporates corrections. In computing suggestions the constraint solving process infers the implications of corrections in a manner which avoids the need to make all constraints explicit.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Intelligent matchmakers can be regarded as a third generation tool for Internet accessibility, where hypertext constitutes the first generation, and search engines the second. "Content-focused matchmaker" agents can provide advice to internet consumers (people or other agents) about complex products <ref> (Gomez et al. 1996) </ref>. The reigning paradigm for such agents is the "deep interview", as embodied in the forthcoming Consumer's Edge website (Krantz 1997), where the primary mode of interaction is the query, made by the Customer to the Matchmaker.

Reference-contexts: The reigning paradigm for such agents is the "deep interview", as embodied in the forthcoming Consumer's Edge website <ref> (Krantz 1997) </ref>, where the primary mode of interaction is the query, made by the Customer to the Matchmaker. We propose a constraint-based paradigm, with a very different form of interaction. In this paradigm, the primary mode of interaction is the "suggestion", made by the Matchmaker to the Customer.

In the latter procedure, after a variable in conflict has been chosen, a value is chosen at random from the domain with probability p, while the usual min-conflicts procedure is followed with probability 1 p.
