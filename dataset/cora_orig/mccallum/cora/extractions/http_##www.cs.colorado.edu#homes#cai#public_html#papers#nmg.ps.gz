Abstract: In this paper, we provide a maximum norm analysis of a finite difference scheme defined on overlapping non-matching grids for second order elliptic problems. We consider a domain which is the union of p overlapping subdomains where each subdomain has its own independently generated grid. The grid points on the subdomain boundaries need not match the grid points from adjacent subdomains. To obtain a global finite difference discretization of the elliptic problem, we employ standard stable finite difference discretizations on each of the overlapping subdomains and the different subproblems are coupled by enforcing continuity of the solutions across the boundary of each subdomain, by interpolating the discrete solution on adjacent subdomains. If the subdomain finite difference schemes satisfy a strong discrete maximum principle and if the overlap is sufficiently large, we show that the global discretization converges in optimal order corresponding to the largest truncation errors of the local interpolation maps and discretizations. Our discretization scheme and the corresponding theory allows any combination of lower order and higher order finite difference schemes in different subdomains. We describe also how the resulting linear system can be solved iteratively by a parallel Schwarz alternating method or a Schwarz preconditioned Krylov subspace iterative method. Several numerical results are included to support the theory.

Discretization on overlapping non-matching grids. The global discretiza-tion method we use is the composite grid method, see for instance, Starius <ref> [28] </ref> and Cheshire and Henshaw [11]. It involves independently discretizing the elliptic equation Lu = f on each of the subgrids and coupling the discretizations by requiring continuity of the solutions across the boundaries.

Reference-contexts: It turns out a slight modification of the algorithm in Section 5.1 offers a very good preconditioner for any Krylov subspace type iterative methods, such as GMRES <ref> [30] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: based on "Lagrange multipliers" and "mortar spaces" have been devised to "glue" together high accuracy local discretizations (for instance, based on spectral methods or p-version finite elements), see for instance, [2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 23], and also lower order local discretizations based on h-version finite elements, see for instance, <ref> [1, 7, 20, 31] </ref>. By contrast, in the finite difference literature, even prior to the development of domain decomposition techniques, several early works have focused on dis-cretizations on non-matching composite grids, see [11, 16, 18, 28, 29].

Reference-contexts: One is a Schwarz type iterative method and the other is a Krylov subspace iterative method with the additive Schwarz method as a preconditioner. 5.1. A parallel Schwarz iterative method. The iterative procedure we de scribe is a parallel variant of the Schwarz alternating method, see for instance <ref> [6, 10, 13, 14, 21, 26, 32] </ref> and involves solving problems on each of the subgrids 0 describe the iterative procedure using the contraction mapping T .
