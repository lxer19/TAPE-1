Abstract: A rich body of data exists showing that recollection of specific information makes an important contribution to recognition memory, which is distinct from the contribution of familiarity, and is not adequately captured by existing unitary memory models. Furthermore, neuropsycholog-ical evidence indicates that recollection is subserved by the hippocampus. We present a model, based largely on known features of hippocampal anatomy and physiology, that accounts for the following key characteristics of recollection: 1) false recollection is rare (i.e., participants rarely claim to recollect having studied nonstudied items), and 2) increasing interference leads to less recollection but apparently does not compromise the quality of recollection (i.e., the extent to which recollected informa tion veridically reflects events that occurred at study).

Reference-contexts: In other memory models, recollection of an item depends critically on the extent to which the components of the item's representation were linked with that of the study context <ref> (e.g., Chappell & Humphreys, 1994) </ref>. Critically, recollection in all of these models lacks the high-threshold, high-quality character of recollection in our model. This is most evident when we consider the effects of manipulations which increase interference (e.g., increasing the length of the study list, or increasing inter-item similarity).

Reference-contexts: Word pairs consisting of two new items failed to trigger recollection of even a single pair component. Similar findings were obtained in our simulation of the <ref> (Hintzman, Curran, & Oppy, 1992) </ref> experiment involving recombinations of word and plurality cues. 6 Discussion While the results presented above have dealt with the presentation of complete probe stimuli for recognition memory tests, our model is obviously capable of explaining cued recall and related phenomena such as source or context memory

Reference-contexts: Further, to the extent that elderly adults form less distinct encodings of stimuli (Rabinowitz & Ackerman, 1982), this explains both their impaired recollection on recognition tests <ref> (Parkin & Walter, 1992) </ref> and their impaired memory for contextual (source) details (Schacter et al., 1991). In summary, existing mathematical models of recognition memory are most likely incorrect in assuming that recognition is performed with one memory system.

Reference-contexts: For example, we predict that successful item recollection will be highly correlated with the ability to recall additional information from the study episode, since both rely on the same underlying memory. Further, to the extent that elderly adults form less distinct encodings of stimuli <ref> (Rabinowitz & Ackerman, 1982) </ref>, this explains both their impaired recollection on recognition tests (Parkin & Walter, 1992) and their impaired memory for contextual (source) details (Schacter et al., 1991).

Reference-contexts: This prediction is consistent with the recent finding that correct recollection of studied items decreases with increasing list length <ref> (Yonelinas, 1994) </ref>. Lastly, although extant data certainly do not contradict the claim that the veridicality of recollection is robust to interference, we acknowledge that additional, focused experimentation is needed to definitively resolve this issue. the Input, EC, and CA1 (see text). b) Shows an example activity pattern.

Reference-contexts: One recent study found that participants are much more likely to claim to recollect studied pairs than re-paired lures <ref> (Yonelinas, 1997) </ref>.
