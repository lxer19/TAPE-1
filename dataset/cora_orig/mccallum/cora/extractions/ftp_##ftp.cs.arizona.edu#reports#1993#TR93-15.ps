Abstract: When an average is taken over any completely monotone function using Poisson weights, the result is asymptotically equal to the completely monotone function evaluated at the Poisson mean. Let N be a Poisson random variable with rate EN. Then if f is any function completely monotone on [0, ), we show that E[f(N)] = f(EN) + O(EN . f (EN)) EN fi . For completely monotone functions that do not decay too rapidly (e.g., regularly varying functions), the error term will be of the order of f (EN)/EN. An application is given to the expectation of random extremes. Let Z (n) denote the maximum of n independent random variables each with the distribution of Z. Since it can be shown that EZ (n) /n is completely monotone for any random variable Z with finite expectation, it follows that

Reference-contexts: The fundamental result about regular variation <ref> [Bin87] </ref> is that if the (finite or infinite) limit (1.2) exists for all l &gt; 1, then there is an extended real number a, a such that " l &gt; 1 lim f (lx ) hhhhh = l a . (1.3) - 1 - --- This a is called the exponent <p> Thus asymptotic equality ~ is the natural equivalence relation on the class of regularly varying functions. Regularly varying functions need not be smooth. However, if such functions are suitably smooth, their derivatives also vary regularly. A number of useful results are cited here. PROPOSITION (Monotone Density Theorem) <ref> [Bin87, p. 39] </ref>. Suppose f (x) = x a l (x) where l R 0 . <p> in some neighborhood of infinity is said to be smoothly varying with index a, written f SR a , if f (x) x n f (n) (x) hhhhhhhh fi a n i x fi (n = 1, 2, . . . ) . (1.6) Smoothly varying functions are discussed in <ref> [Bin87, 1.8] </ref>. We have the following connection to complete monotonicity. THEOREM 1.1. If f c.m.[a, ) and f R a , for some finite a (necessarily a 0), then f SR a . Proof: Consider first the case a &lt; 0. <p> When a = 0, this is interpreted as f (n) (x) = o (f (x )x -n ). Not all completely monotone functions are regularly varying. If f is given by the Bernstein representation (1.1), then it follows from Karamata's Tauberian Theorem <ref> [Bin87, Theorem 1.7.1; Fel71, XIII.5, Theorem 2] </ref> that f R a for some a 0 if and only if m (1 /s) R a (i.e., m (s) is regularly varying as s fi 0.)

Reference-contexts: The basis for n = 1 is just Lamperti's Theorem.
