Abstract: Overlapping Schwarz is a family of preconditioners for solving large sparse linear systems arising from the discretization of partial differential equations, see e.g. [CS96, DW94, SBG95]. Here we report on our preliminary experiences on using it in the implicit solution of unsteady Navier-Stokes (N.-S.) equations discretized on two-dimensional unstructured meshes. One of the advantages of implicit methods is that they allow the time steps to be determined solely based on the physics of the fluid flow, not on the stability property of the time discretization scheme, [Ven95, VM95]. To advance in time, a large linear system of equations must be solved. Depending of the size of the time step, and other flow parameters, the conditioning of the matrix may change drastically from time step to time step. To solve these systems iteratively, it is necessary to have a family of preconditioners whose strength can be controlled. Overlapping Schwarz methods do have these properties, for

We 4 SCHWARZ PRECONDITIONERS denote the set of vertices (or nodes) by N = f1; ; ng, where n represents the total number of nodes (or unknowns). To define algebraic Schwarz algorithms <ref> [CS96] </ref>, we first partition the set N into n 0 nonoverlapping subsets N i whose union is N . We use the TOP/DOMDEC mesh partitioning package of Farhat et al. [FLS95] to obtain sets N i . The recursive spectral bisection method with certain optimization is used in the partitioning.
