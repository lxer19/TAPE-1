Reference-contexts: Object-relational systems have maintained backward compatibility with conventional relational engines. They can be used anywhere that relational engines can, because they provide the same operations and abstractions as relational engines. Object-relational engines use SQL3 <ref> [ANSI96] </ref>, a superset of the query language supported by relational engines. At the same time, object-relational systems borrowed heavily from work on object-oriented programming languages and systems. Copyright 1996 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

Reference-contexts: Only with widespread production use of these systems will their real strengths and weaknesses become apparent. As a result, it is critical that object-relational engines continue to evolve, so that they can meet the demands of workloads that no one has yet foreseen. With that caveat, <ref> [Dewi96] </ref> summarizes the most interesting performance questions confronting object-relational systems today. In the next several sections, we describe in detail how object-relational systems are able to overcome the problems cited in [Dewi96], and how they will change over the next several years as new problems arise. 3.1 Skew Data skew is <p> With that caveat, <ref> [Dewi96] </ref> summarizes the most interesting performance questions confronting object-relational systems today. In the next several sections, we describe in detail how object-relational systems are able to overcome the problems cited in [Dewi96], and how they will change over the next several years as new problems arise. 3.1 Skew Data skew is a well-known problem in relational systems. <p> Finally, data may be partitioned based on value ranges, so that employees who make between zero and twenty thousand dollars a year are assigned to one disk, with other salary ranges assigned to other disks. <ref> [Dewi96] </ref> asserts that object-relational systems suffer more severely from skew than do relational systems. As an example, the paper draws on several novel features of object-relational systems, and 6 describes how they can further skew distributions or lead to queries that do not match data distribu-tions. <p> As an example, the paper draws on several novel features of object-relational systems, and 6 describes how they can further skew distributions or lead to queries that do not match data distribu-tions. The INFORMIX-Universal Server uses data partitioning to provide intra-query parallelism and supports all the features that <ref> [Dewi96] </ref> uses in its example on skew. In order to understand the example, and why it is incorrect, it is important to understand the object-relational features that motivate it. First, schema designers may create row types. <p> Again, relational systems force designers to implement one-to-many foreign key relationships for a similar result. Object-relational systems make this easier to use by providing syntax and behavior that more closely matches the user's conceptual schema. Using these features, <ref> [Dewi96] </ref> defines the following schema: create row type emp_t (name varchar, salary money); create table depts (name varchar, emps set (emp_t)) fragment by round robin in disk1, disk2, ...; As in relational systems, if employees are not evenly distributed among departments, this schema is skewed. <p> In fact, if we replace the set notation in this example with explicit join keys, and then fragment employees by department, we can produce an identical data distribution using a relational engine. <ref> [Dewi96] </ref> claims that object-relational systems suffer because they cannot support fragmentation strategies that store sets on different disks from the rows that contain them. In fact, the behavior of any particular object-relational system is, in this case, a detail of its implementation, and not a fundamental feature of object-relational systems. <p> An ORDBMS provides much more control to a schema designer to handle skew and do intelligent data distribution than does a conventional RDBMS. 7 3.2 Bad Schema Design To alleviate the problems in the schema declared above, <ref> [Dewi96] </ref> proposes creating separate tables for employees and departments, and partitioning both of them in round-robin fashion across disks in the database. Given that schema, [Dewi96] correctly demonstrates that some queries will perform badly. <p> skew and do intelligent data distribution than does a conventional RDBMS. 7 3.2 Bad Schema Design To alleviate the problems in the schema declared above, <ref> [Dewi96] </ref> proposes creating separate tables for employees and departments, and partitioning both of them in round-robin fashion across disks in the database. Given that schema, [Dewi96] correctly demonstrates that some queries will perform badly. <p> Any physical organization of data on disk must consider the most common user queries, and data should be clustered to optimize those queries. This requirement has long been acknowledged for relational systems, and applies just as strongly to object-relational ones. The basic problem with <ref> [Dewi96] </ref> is that it partitions data to support a particular workload, and then evaluates the schema using another workload entirely. Any system can provide at most one clustering strategy for data without copies. <p> An object-relational system outperforms a relational one, if the two systems have identical data partitioning and query plans, because the object-relational system allows designers to choose among several models, such as explicit joins versus references, for performance or representational reasons. 3.3 Large Values Finally, <ref> [Dewi96] </ref> explores performance of queries that operate over large data values by using three examples. <p> As new price information arrives over the ticker, it is added to the appropriate timeseries value in the table. Given this schema, for example, a user could write a query that computes the average closing price of a particular stock. <ref> [Dewi96] </ref> makes the point that if values in a timeseries are not partitioned across disks, then this query will get no benefit from parallelism. That claim is correct, but is not an indictment of object-relational systems. <p> By partitioning timeseries values across disks, schema developers can take advantage of intra-function parallelism. Relational systems, which do not even support the new collection type, cannot offer the same functionality or performance. 8 3.3.2 Video The next example in <ref> [Dewi96] </ref> uses video to argue that object-relational systems will not scale. <p> Naturally, there are issues of referential integrity and access control to consider, but the important point is that an ORDBMS is flexible enough to support both local and remote management of large data values. 3.3.3 Images The third, and final, example type is image data. In this case, <ref> [Dewi96] </ref> claims that queries operating over images will run slowly, because the system has no way to parallelize expensive operations on single images. In fact, an ORDBMS offers a number of ways to exploit parallelism.

Reference-contexts: In this case, [Dewi96] claims that queries operating over images will run slowly, because the system has no way to parallelize expensive operations on single images. In fact, an ORDBMS offers a number of ways to exploit parallelism. INFORMIX-Universal Server uses the strategy from Volcano, discussed in <ref> [Grae90] </ref>, to represent in the query plan the points at which parallelism is possible. A type or function designer only needs to create a special class of function, called an iterator, in order to allow intra-operator parallelism.

Reference-contexts: introduction of parallelism have all, over the years, attracted the attention of researchers. Innovations in these areas and others have produced a wide variety of fast, inexpensive, and powerful relational database systems. Beginning roughly in 1985, with work on POSTGRES [Ston86] and Starburst <ref> [Haas90] </ref>, researchers began to investigate a different kind of performance. Commercial relational systems were designed to execute queries quickly. These new research efforts were, fundamentally, designed to adapt quickly to changing business requirements, such as the need to model evolving business rules and manage new kinds of data.
