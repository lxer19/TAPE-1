Title: An Event-Based Model for Continuous Media Data on Heterogeneous Disk Servers  
Author: K. Sel~cuk Candan, Eenjun Hwang, and V.S. Subrahmanian 
Abstract: Over the last few years, there has been intense work on the problem of retrieval of continuous media (CM) data from disk. However, no single unified framework exists within which such retrieval problems can be studied. In this paper, we first propose a formal model for CM-data retrieval from heterogeneous disk servers. This model can be used to characterize CM-data retrieval problems independently of how data is laid-out on disk, and what objectives (e.g. minimize client delay, maximize buffer utilization, etc.) the system manager is interested in. We then show how using this formal model, we can neatly define what it means to optimally handle events that occur in movie-on-demand (MOD) systems. Examples of such events include new clients entering the system, old clients leaving the system, continuing clients doing pause, rewind and fast-forward operations. Multiple events may occur simultaneously and we show how such events trigger state-transitions in the system. We then develop an algorithm called the QuickSOL algorithm that handles events occurring in MOD systems. This algorithm works in two phases: in the first phase it quickly finds a way of handling as many of the events occurring at time t as possible. In the second phase, it optimizes the solution found in the first phase. The advantage is that the algorithm can be interrupted anytime after the first phase is completed. We report on experiments showing that QuickSOL works well in practice. fl This research was supported by the Army Research Office under grants DAAH-04-95-10174 and DAAH-04-96-10297, by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research under grant F49620-93-1-0065, by ARPA/Rome Labs contract Nr.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction During the last few years, the problem of efficiently retrieving continuous media data (CM-data, for short) from disk has been recognized as a major problem that must be solved if applications such as video-on-demand are to become a commercial reality. Towards this end, several authors <ref> [2, 17, 18, 22, 25] </ref> have proposed frameworks for organizing CM-data on disk furthermore, a wide variety of impressive experimental results [3, 10, 8, 12, 15] have been reported in the literature. In this paper, we will propose a unified framework for the modeling and evaluation of CM-disk servers. <p> Thus, using a model such as Ruemmler and Wilkes [21], one could dynamically determine quantities such as disk bandwidth, and then use such computed quantities to solve other problems. We adopt the second approach (as do many other authors such as <ref> [2, 7, 8, 9, 12, 15] </ref>) because our interest is in determining how to assign tasks to a server when a set of heterogeneous servers are available, and when these sets contain different content. <p> Work on Placement Mappings: Vin et. al.[25] develop two different ways of placing media data on disk arrays and analyze the performance of media systems based on these placement strategies. Similarly, Berson and Ghandeharizadeh <ref> [2] </ref> argue that staggered striping (a particular kind of placement mapping) enhances performance in video on demand systems. Ozden et. al. [17] propose movie on demand systems where each movie is stored on a separate disk which, of course, is a special kind of placement mapping. <p> We have developed the QuickSOL algorithm that efficiently computes new states that handle a set of client transactions. QuickSOL is independent of placement mappings, and independent of objective functions, and hence, it can work with many different placement mappings <ref> [2, 18, 22, 25] </ref>. We have implemented our QuickSOL algorithm and conducted experiments to determine how many clients can be effectively serviced by QuickSOL. Furthermore, QuickSOL applies to many situations to which previous special-purpose algorithms do not apply, thus making it much more widely usable. Acknowledgments.

Towards this end, several authors <ref> [2, 17, 18, 22, 25] </ref> have proposed frameworks for organizing CM-data on disk furthermore, a wide variety of impressive experimental results [3, 10, 8, 12, 15] have been reported in the literature. In this paper, we will propose a unified framework for the modeling and evaluation of CM-disk servers. <p> To our knowledge, this is the first provably correct, optimal algorithm for retrieving continuous media data from disk. 4. Most existing algorithms assume that the CM-data being accessed is laid out on disk in a specific way - e.g. by striping <ref> [22, 18] </ref>. We expect (and hope !) that techniques to lay out data on disk will improve as time goes by. <p> One can think of this as a form of striping <ref> [22, 18] </ref> however, there are significant differences also. In striping, data is striped across disks to effect an increase bandwidth. In contrast, in event splitting, a client request (i.e. event) is broken up into smaller events that may be satisfied by distributing the load across multiple servers. <p> We have developed the QuickSOL algorithm that efficiently computes new states that handle a set of client transactions. QuickSOL is independent of placement mappings, and independent of objective functions, and hence, it can work with many different placement mappings <ref> [2, 18, 22, 25] </ref>. We have implemented our QuickSOL algorithm and conducted experiments to determine how many clients can be effectively serviced by QuickSOL. Furthermore, QuickSOL applies to many situations to which previous special-purpose algorithms do not apply, thus making it much more widely usable. Acknowledgments.

In many experiments, such as [19], the disk transfer rate is taken as 1 MB/sec. We also based our simulations on this value. However, we varied the transfer rates of the disks to have a heteregeneous simulation environment. The resulting average disk rate of the 350 servers was 1.6 MB/sec. <p> As can be easily seen from 37 the figures, even though we have a much higher arrival rate of client requests and a fully loaded system, FindSOL often responds faster than existing algorithms <ref> [19] </ref>. 6 Related Work Over the last few years, there has been growing interest in the efficient retrieval of multimedia data from disk. Venkat Rangan et. al.[5] provides an excellent survey of the state of the art techniques used in video storage and retrieval.

Reference-contexts: In particular, our model assumes that a given movie (or even certain blocks of a movie) can be replicated across multiple disk servers. The concept of a placement mapping is different from that of data layout typically studied by disk researchers <ref> [21] </ref>. In our case, a placement mapping tells us, given a move block, which logical blocks on disk it corresponds to. In contrast, in the case of data layouts [21], we are mapping logical disk blocks to physical sectors on the disk (Figure 4). <p> The concept of a placement mapping is different from that of data layout typically studied by disk researchers <ref> [21] </ref>.

In contrast, in the case of data layouts [21], we are mapping logical disk blocks to physical sectors on the disk (Figure 4). Note that placement mappings may change time because the system administrator may reconfigure the contents of the disk over time. <p> In general, there are two ways to model disks. * In the first way, one models the behavior of the disk at a very fine level, tightly coupled to the hardware characteristics. Such models have been proposed, for instance, by Ruemmler and Wilkes <ref> [21] </ref>, as well as many others ([23, 26], to name a few). Using such models, we may determine how to schedule the speedup, coast, slowdown, settle operations performed by the disk head. Programs exist [21] to compute such schedules. 34 * In the second way, one assumes that parameters such as <p> Such models have been proposed, for instance, by Ruemmler and Wilkes <ref> [21] </ref>, as well as many others ([23, 26], to name a few).

In the simulations outlined in this paper, we started a system "from scratch" (i.e. no clients) and injected clients into the system over a period of 2000 cycles (approx. 60 minutes).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction During the last few years, the problem of efficiently retrieving continuous media data (CM-data, for short) from disk has been recognized as a major problem that must be solved if applications such as video-on-demand are to become a commercial reality. Towards this end, several authors <ref> [2, 17, 18, 22, 25] </ref> have proposed frameworks for organizing CM-data on disk furthermore, a wide variety of impressive experimental results [3, 10, 8, 12, 15] have been reported in the literature. In this paper, we will propose a unified framework for the modeling and evaluation of CM-disk servers. <p> To our knowledge, this is the first provably correct, optimal algorithm for retrieving continuous media data from disk. 4. Most existing algorithms assume that the CM-data being accessed is laid out on disk in a specific way - e.g. by striping <ref> [22, 18] </ref>. We expect (and hope !) that techniques to lay out data on disk will improve as time goes by. <p> One can think of this as a form of striping <ref> [22, 18] </ref> however, there are significant differences also. In striping, data is striped across disks to effect an increase bandwidth. In contrast, in event splitting, a client request (i.e. event) is broken up into smaller events that may be satisfied by distributing the load across multiple servers. <p> We have developed the QuickSOL algorithm that efficiently computes new states that handle a set of client transactions. QuickSOL is independent of placement mappings, and independent of objective functions, and hence, it can work with many different placement mappings <ref> [2, 18, 22, 25] </ref>. We have implemented our QuickSOL algorithm and conducted experiments to determine how many clients can be effectively serviced by QuickSOL. Furthermore, QuickSOL applies to many situations to which previous special-purpose algorithms do not apply, thus making it much more widely usable. Acknowledgments.
