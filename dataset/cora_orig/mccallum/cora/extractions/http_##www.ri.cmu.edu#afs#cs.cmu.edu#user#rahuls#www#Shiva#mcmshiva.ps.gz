Abstract: SHIVA (Simulated Highways for Intelligent Vehicle Algorithms) is a kinematic simulation of vehicles moving and interacting on a user-defined stretch of roadway. The vehicles can be equipped with simulated human drivers as well as sensors and algorithms for automated control. These algorithms influence the vehicles' motion through simulated commands to the accelerator, brake and steering wheel. SHIVA's user interface provides facilities for visualizing and influencing the interactions between vehicles. SHIVA not only models the elements of the domain most useful to tactical driving research but also provides tools to rapidly prototype and test algorithms in challenging traffic situations. Additionally, the scenario control tools allow repeatable testing of different reasoning systems on a consistent set of traffic situations. These features are vital in the development and evaluation of intelligent vehicle technology for ITS applications.

Reference-contexts: The mixed traffic environment is especially challenging since intelligent vehicles must make driving decisions based on incomplete information about the environment. Thus, it is critical that automated vehicles in this concept exhibit effective tactical-level <ref> [9] </ref> reasoning before they are introduced into human traffic.

Our second driving system, SAPIENT <ref> [9] </ref> addresses these deficiencies by distributing the driving task over a set of local experts, known as reasoning objects. Each reasoning object monitors an observable entity in the tactical driving situation (such as an exit or a nearby vehicle) and votes on the utility of various potential actions.

Reference-contexts: Figure 1 shows an overhead view of a typical merge scenario. 2 Tactical-level Simulation The driving task can be characterized as consisting of three levels: strategic, tactical and operational <ref> [12] </ref>. At the strategic level, a route is planned and goals are determined; at the tactical level, appropriate maneuvers are selected to achieve short-term objectives; and at the operational level, these maneuvers are translated into control operations. <p> Most traffic simulators use very simple vehicle models allow efficient computation of flow statistics even for large networks. Conversely, vehicle simulators represent sub-systems at a detailed level (engine models, transmission characteristics, braking behavior) to examine car performance but cannot support multiple vehicles. In Michon's classification scheme <ref> [12] </ref>, the former can be considered suitable for strategic-level simulation, and the latter for operational-level simulation. Very few simulators address the needs of tactical-level research.

Unfortunately these effects are relevant during lane changing. <p> One way to accomplish this is to build the simulator on top of a persistent database (e.g. SmartAHS <ref> [15] </ref> is built over Versant). The biggest advantage of this is that state is implicitly saved (allowing rewinding of the simulation on demand). Unfortunately, the price for this convenience is that each time-step of the simulation incurs a substantial overhead.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, since none of these tools were designed specifically for tactical-level simulation, each has significant deficiencies in the area. Pharos makes some unrealistic sensor assumptions such as transparent vehicles; SmartPath, though well suited for modeling platoon concepts (where groups of very closely spaced automated vehicles drive along dedicated lanes) <ref> [16] </ref>, cannot support reasoning systems which violate its state machine architecture; SmartAHS has significant potential for further development, but is currently only a simulation framework. In designing SHIVA, we were faced with a number of difficult design decisions.

Unfortunately these effects are relevant during lane changing. <p> Sensors cover different areas of interest around the vehicle, and can be activated (or panned) by the cognition modules as needed during tactical maneuvers to provide relevant information about surrounding traffic. Since perception is expensive, this selective perception enables cognition modules to minimize the computational load <ref> [18] </ref>. 6 interact with the simulated world. The design tools automatically adapt to each vehicle's internal configuration and provide access to the various components at an appropriate level of detail. 7 Wherever possible, SHIVA is compatible with existing perception and control modules available on the Navlab. available on real robots. <p> A danger with using functional sensor models is that the the simulator may provide unrealistically complete data of the environment. This tendency is common in earlier work in tactical simulation. For example: perfect measurement of sensed vehicles' acceleration [19]; transparent vehicles <ref> [18] </ref>; and straight road assumptions [20]. <p> Our cognition module has hand-crafted rules for car following, gap acceptance, merging and exit maneuvers. In addition to triggering tactical actions, the rules in our cognition module also actively control the vehicle's sensors. This selective perception has been shown to significantly reduce perceptual costs in driving <ref> [18] </ref>. This is possible only because SHIVA allows us to model individual sensors (most traffic simulators do not). 11.2 Distributed Reasoning for Driving While the rule-based controller described above performs well under most conditions, it scales poorly as the complexity of scenarios increases.

SHIVA's controller also supports low-level steering control through active road-following. In this paradigm, cognition modules specify desired lateral position through manipulation of the pure-pursuit point (See Section 5.2).

Reference-contexts: SHIVA also supports lane trackers that actively steer the vehicle. By varying the desired lateral offset (represented by the pure-pursuit point) smoothly from the center of one lane to the the center of the desired adjacent lane, these road followers are able to implement lane changes <ref> [26] </ref>. It is important to note that the actual lateral offset of the vehicle always lags the current position of its pure-pursuit point during the lane change. 5.3 Positioning SHIVA simulates two types of positioning sensors: global positioning systems (GPS) and dead-reckoning.

Reference-contexts: In the absence of engine, transmission and suspension models, simulating actuation is relatively straightforward. The control interface is compatible with the Navlab controller <ref> [27] </ref>: cognition modules provide a control tuple, C = (k; v) where k is the desired curvature and v is the desired velocity. Cognition modules provide C to the controller at regular time intervals; in the absence of new information, the controller will servo on the last commanded tuple. <p> The controllers generate steering wheel position and throttle/brake commands to bring current vehicle curvature and velocity to the desired positions as quickly as possible. The controller also enforces limits on acceleration and rate of change of curvature.

Reference-contexts: The votes for each action are processed by an arbiter, and the most popular action is executed. Each reasoning object's behavior depends on a number of internal parameters which are automatically learned by an evolutionary algorithm, PBIL <ref> [32] </ref>. PBIL tests a large number of vehicles with different parameter values on a set of scenarios to derive good parameter settings, which can then be transplanted into cognition modules to be used on a Navlab vehicle.

Reference-contexts: This approach relies heavily on SHIVA's scenario generation facilities, and on the consistent interface between simulated and real test vehicles. A number of other ITS-related projects are currently being developed using SHIVA's highway environment. These include a k-nearest neighbor adaptive controller <ref> [33] </ref> (for direct sensor-to-actuation mapping), realistic tire/surface and vehicle models for obstacle-avoidance [34] and human driver models for the Automated Highway System program. 16 12 Conclusions Simulation is critical in the development of ITS for economic and safety reasons.

SHIVA fills a gap in traffic modeling technology by providing a simulation and design environment targeted for tactical-level analysis.
