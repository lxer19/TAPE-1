Abstract: MIT Media Laboratory, Perceptual Computing Technical Report #452 Abstract We propose Action-Reaction Learning as an approach for analyzing and synthesizing human behaviour. This paradigm uncovers causal mappings between past and future events or between an action and its reaction by observing time sequences. We apply this method to analyze human interaction and to subsequently synthesize human behaviour. Using a time series of perceptual measurements, a system automatically uncovers a mapping between gestures from one human participant (an action) and a subsequent gesture (a reaction) from another participant. A probabilistic model is trained from data of the human interaction using a novel estimation technique, Conditional Expectation Maximization (CEM). The system drives a graphical interactive character which probabilistically predicts the most likely response to the user's behaviour and performs it interactively. Thus, after analyzing human interaction in a pair of participants, the system is able to replace one of them and interact with a single remaining user.

Reference-contexts: With these features alone, it is possible to engage in simple gestural games and interactions. The vision algorithm begins by forming a probabilistic model of skin colored regions <ref> [1] </ref>. During an offline process, a variety of skin-colored pixels are selected manually, forming a distribution in rgb space. This distribution can be described by a probability density function which is used to estimate the likelihood of any subsequent pixel (x r gb) being a skin colored pixel.

Reference-contexts: Techniques such as Expectation Maximization <ref> [6] </ref> can be used to optimize the parameters of a probability density function such that its joint density is a good model of the data. In clustering, for instance, data is treated homogeneously without special considerations for the distinction between input x and output y.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a linear ramp function is multiplied with each time series. This reflects our intuition that the more temporally distant the elements in the time series the less relevant they are for prediction <ref> [7] </ref>. The linear ramp multiplication and rasterization process is depicted in Figure 7. Each 50ms, the window slides 50ms to the right, and we re-rasterize the data into another vector in R 3840 .

Reference-contexts: Thus, when fitting a probabilistic model to the data, we should optimize it only to predict y (x is always measured). L = i=1 We recently developed a variant of the EM algorithm called Conditional Expectation Maximization (CEM) for specifically optimizing conditional likelihood <ref> [11] </ref>. It essentially fits a probability density function (pdf) that maximizes the conditional likelihood of the response given the covariates.

Reference-contexts: This mode of operation is currently under investigation. 11.2 Face Modeling for Interaction Face modeling can also be used to recover more perceptual details for a convincing interaction. A system which automatically detects the face and tracks it has been implemented <ref> [12] </ref>. It is capable of tracking the 3D rotations and movements of a face using normalized correlation coupled with structure from motion. In addition, at each moment in time, it can compute an eigenspace model of the face's texture which is then used to infer some 3D deformations.

Reference-contexts: Due to its flexibility to model non-linear phenomena and its ease of use, we use a conditioned mixture of Gaussians <ref> [13] </ref>. <p> EM, on the other hand, typically optimizes p (x; y), the ability to model the data as a whole. Since resources (i.e. memory, complexity) are sparse and training examples are finite, it is preferable here to directly optimize the model's conditional likelihood <ref> [13] </ref> [19] using CEM. In other words, we want the learning system to be good at figuring out what Mrs. Dash will do next (i.e. use x to predict y). We are not as interested in asking the system what past event would have provoked Mrs.

Reference-contexts: Earlier models of human behaviour proposed by cognitive scientists analyzed humans as an input-output or stimulus-response system [25] [23].

Nevertheless, much of the lower-order reactionary behaviour was still well modeled by the stimulus-response paradigm. Of particular relevance is the close similarity of the stimulus-response behaviourist model to input-output learning algorithms.

Rather, the model will be used for unsupervised analysis and its ultimate goal is the synthesis of such human behaviour with minimal artificial constraints, hand-wired knowledge and zero user intervention.

Reference-contexts: The system then operates in an unsupervised manner as it slides these windows across the data stream. Essentially, the learning uncovers a mapping between past and future to later generate its best possible prediction. Interaction can be learned from a variety of approaches including reinforcement learning <ref> [24] </ref>. The objective here is is primarily an imitation-type learning of interaction. 2 Perceptual System Of primary concern in the visual perceptual system is the recovery of action parameters which are particularly expressive and interactive. In addition, to maintain real-time interactiveness and fast training, the parameters should be compact.
