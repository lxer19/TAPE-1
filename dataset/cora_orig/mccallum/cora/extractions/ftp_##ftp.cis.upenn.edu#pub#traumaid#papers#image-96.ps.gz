Abstract: Injuries in trauma affect anatomical structures and indirectly affect physiological systems through mechanical behavior and physical proximity. This paper presents our methods and models for simulation cardiopulmonary anatomy and physiology. We demonstrate our system that simulates normal, quiet breathing, and a tension pneumoth-orax. Our goal is to enable students of anatomy and physiology to explore, with the greatest degree of freedom possible, some of the causes and effects of normal and pathological behaviors in trauma, in a 3D interactive, virtual environment. We propose to accomplish this by integrating visually-plausible, physics-based deformable anatomical models with mathematical models of physiological processes. In this pursuit, we are developing unique models and confronting issues in making anatomy in virtual environments both look and behave realistically.

Reference-contexts: Comprehensive physiological simulations (e.g., [Cole-man and Randell, 1983]) display their (scalar) results in graphs or with simple graphical output (e.g., [Schwid and O'Donnell, 1990]). However, none of the above attempts model graphically the anatomical changes. Part of the long-term goals for the Visible Human Project <ref> (Ackerman, 1991) </ref> is to perform basic research into representation of structures, particularly encoding the connection between structural-anatomical to functional-physiological knowledge. Our effort is in this area.

Reference-contexts: Our effort is in this area. We have recently proposed to tie together deformable body dynamics with conventional physiological modeling and have developed a preliminary system <ref> (Kaye, Primiano, and Metaxas, 1995) </ref>. In this paper, we expand this system by improving both the anatomical and physiological capabilities. To model deformable bodies, we combine global (i.e., whole body) deformations, such as scaling, with viscoelastic elements that capture local deformations. <p> Once we have captured mechanical behavior adequately, we can enhance our system to include biochemical and neurological influences. This higher-level physiology in turn may influence the mechanical processes by, for example, increasing ventilation (respiratory) rate or airway dimensions in response to hypoxia or hypercapnia. Respiratory Mechanics In <ref> (Kaye, Primiano, and Metaxas, 1995) </ref>, we discuss the formal basis of our approach, called classical respiratory mechanics modeling (Ligas and Primiano, 1988). This approach uses pressure differences as generalized forces and volumes as generalized displacements.

The pressures and volumes we consider are observable variables, in general, which makes our modeling amenable to simulating patient-specific circumstances in clinical situations.

Reference-contexts: The chest wall models we currently use have four degrees-of-freedom: the ribcage, the diaphragm, the mediastinum, and the common junction. Our development of the mediastinum extends the model created in <ref> (Primiano, 1982) </ref>, and, to our knowledge, makes it unique in the literature. General Model. Fig. 4 gives a mechanical illustration of the components in this initial approach. <p> We use this assumption in the results we present later. Interestingly, if we go to the other extreme (f JRC ! 0) and make the chest wall flaccid (as seen pathologically in neonates and quadriplegic patients), the simulation produces the paradoxical breathing patterns that these patients exhibit <ref> (Primiano, 1982) </ref>. Therefore, this general model is capable of representing a wide array of pathologies.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> (Rideout, 1991) </ref>, the extra-vascular pressure is assumed to be zero, but in more detailed models, intrathoracic pressure is not constant. In our cardiovascular model currently, we assume a constant intrathoracic pressure.

Reference-contexts: The parietal pleural is divided into the surfaces that are apposed to the ribcage, mediastinum, and diaphragm. A highly-tuned spring-damper system is sufficient for modeling the anatomy and approximating the vis-coelastic properties of the pulmonary system for our purposes. Based on Rodarte's suggestion <ref> (Rodarte, 1989) </ref> that the lung behaves essentially as an isotropic elastic material (if one ignores deformations due to the lung's own weight), we modify the spring-damper formulation to include a piece-wise scaling deformation. This reduces the complexity of the models and hence improves performance.
