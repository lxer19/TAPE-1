Abstract: The members of electronic communities are often unrelated to each other, they may have never met and have no information on each other's reputation. This kind of information is vital in Electronic Commerce interactions, where the potential counterpart's reputation can be a significant factor in the negotiation strategy. This paper proposes two complementary reputation mechanisms that rely on collaborative rating and personalized evaluation of the various ratings assigned to each user. While these reputation mechanisms are developed in the context of electronic commerce, we believe that they may have applicability in other types of electronic communities such as chatrooms, newsgroups, mailing lists etc.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Consumer to consumer electronic transaction systems like Kasbah <ref> [1] </ref>, eBay [2] and "ONSALE Exchange Auction Classifieds" [3] create online market places that bring together users unknown to each other. <p> Each agent's goal is to make the "best deal" possible, subject to a set of userspecified constraints, such as a desired price, a highest (or lowest) acceptable price, and a date to complete the transaction <ref> [1] </ref>. ONSALE Exchange is an online auction specializing in computer products, consumer electronics, sporting goods, and auction classifieds, where sellers can list their items for sale and buyers compete in the auction-like bidding system to buy the posted items. <p> In both sites the reputation value of a seller is available with any textual comments that may exist to the potential bidders. The latest release of Kasbah <ref> [1] </ref> features a Better Business Bureau service that implements the reputation mechanisms we describe below.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Consumer to consumer electronic transaction systems like Kasbah [1], eBay [2] and "ONSALE Exchange Auction Classifieds" <ref> [3] </ref> create online market places that bring together users unknown to each other. <p> The user sees the articles with a value equal to the average of the ratings given to the article by users in the same cluster. The most relevant computational methods to our knowledge, are the reputation mechanism of the OnSale Exchange <ref> [3] </ref> and the eBay [2]. OnSale allows its users to rate and submit textual comments about sellers and overall reputation value of a seller is the average of his/her ratings through his usage of the OnSale system.

Reference-contexts: Reputation is usually defined as the amount of trust inspired by the particular person in a specific setting or domain of interest <ref> [4] </ref>. In "Trust in a Cryptographic Economy" [5] reputation is regarded as asset creation and it is evaluated according to its expected economic returns. Reputation is conceived as a multidimensional value. An individual may enjoy a very high reputation in one domain, while he/she has a low reputation in another. <p> Finally we have to consider the effect of the memory of our system <ref> [4] </ref>. The larger the number of ratings used in the evaluation of reputation values the highest the predictability of the mechanism it gets. However, since the reputation values are associated with human individuals and humans change their behavior over time it is desirable to disregard very old ratings.

Reference-contexts: Related Work The study of reputation brokering for online communities has generally focused on content filtering. We can divide the related work into two major categories: the noncomputational ones like the local Better Business Bureaus <ref> [6] </ref> and the computational ones. The computational methods cover a broad domain of applications, from rating of newsgroup postings and webpages, to rating people and their expertise in specific areas. In this section we focus on the related computational methods and compare their major features in Table 1. <p> This central agency also keeps records of complaints by users in textual formats and even publishes warnings against possibly malicious users, pretty much like the local Better Business Bureaus in the US <ref> [6] </ref>. Adopting such a solution requires a lot of overhead on the behalf of the providers of the online community. Other proposed approaches are more distributed.

Reference-contexts: One approach to building a reputation mechanism is to have a central agency that keeps records of the recent activity of the users on the system, very much like the scoring systems of credit history agencies <ref> [7] </ref>. This central agency also keeps records of complaints by users in textual formats and even publishes warnings against possibly malicious users, pretty much like the local Better Business Bureaus in the US [6]. <p> The value of q determines how fast the reputation value of the user changes after each rating. The larger the value of q, the longer the memory the system. Thus, just like credit card history schemes <ref> [7] </ref>, even if a user enters the system being really unreliable in the beginning, if he/she improves later, his/her reputation value will not suffer forever from the early poor behavior. over 100 ratings with q = 1 0 5.

Reference-contexts: Adopting such a solution requires a lot of overhead on the behalf of the providers of the online community. Other proposed approaches are more distributed. For example, approaches such as Yenta <ref> [8] </ref>, Weaving a web of Trust [9], or the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) [10], (like the Recreational Software Advisory Council [11]) would require that users give a rating for themselves and either have a central agency or other trusted users verify their trustworthiness.

Weaving a Web of Trust, <ref> [9] </ref> The reputation mechanism described in the previous section provides a global reputation value for each member of the online community, which is associated with them as part of their identity. <p> FFF [12] and the PGP web of Trust [17] use the idea that as social beings we tend to trust a friend of a friend more than a total stranger. Following a similar approach, we decided to build a more personalized system. In Weaving a Web of Trust <ref> [9] </ref>, what matters is that there is a connected path of PGP signed webpages between two users. In our case we have to take into consideration the different reputation ratings connecting the users of our system.

Reference-contexts: Thus all new members would have to await the validation by other trustworthy users of the system. A user would end up evaluating their counterparts' reputation as a consequent of number and trustworthiness of the recommendations for each user. Friend of a Friend Finder (FFF) <ref> [12] </ref>, Yenta and Weaving Web of Trust introduce computational methods for creating personal recommendation systems, the former two for people and the latter for webpages. <p> The existing social relationships as well as the actual physical transaction process create personalized biases on the trust relationships between those users.
