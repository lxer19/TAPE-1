Title: An Integrated Implementation of Simulative, Uncertain and Metaphorical Reasoning about Mental States

Abstract: An unprecedented combination of simulative and metaphor based reasoning about beliefs is achieved in an AI system, ATT-Meta. Much mundane discourse about beliefs productively uses conceptual metaphors such as MIND AS CONTAINER and IDEAS AS INTERNAL UTTERANCES, and ATT-Meta's metaphor-based reasoning accordingly leads to crucial discourse comprehension decisions. ATT-Meta's non-metaphorical mode of belief reasoning includes simulative reasoning (SR). In ATT-Meta, metaphor-based reasoning can block and otherwise influence the course of SR.

Reference-contexts: Two others, MIND PARTS AS PERSONS and IDEAS AS MODELS, are omitted from this paper for brevity, but see Barnden (1989, 1992). There are many commonly-used, important metaphors of mind. See, for example, Lakoff et al. (1991) <ref> (and Barnden 1989, 1992 for further metaphors and citations) </ref>. If one looked only at (1b,c,d) one might dispute the above claims about metaphor, saying that those sentences just involved canned forms of language.

Reference-contexts: For instance, one subregion can contain the thought that a recipe is wrong, whereas another can contain the thought that the recipe is right. Alternatively, thoughts in one subregion can simply be absent from another. In (1c) we see the conceptual metaphor of IDEAS AS INTERNAL UTTERANCES <ref> (following Barnden 1992) </ref>. A thinking episode is portrayed as inner speech within the agent (or, more rarely, as inner non-speech utterances).

Reference-contexts: The SR and metaphor-based reasoning are completely integrated into a powerful and practical uncertain/defeasible reasoning framework. The SR is unusual in distinguishing conscious belief as an important special case. ATT-Meta is one of the few implemented, or detailed theoretical, schemes for significant metaphor-based reasoning. <ref> (Others are Hobbs 1990 and Martin 1990.) </ref> We integrate metaphor-based reasoning into an uncertain reasoning framework much as Hobbs does, except that he uses abductive framework.
