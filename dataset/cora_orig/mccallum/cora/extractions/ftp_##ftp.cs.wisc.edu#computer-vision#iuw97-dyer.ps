Abstract: This report summarizes the research effort at the University of Wisconsin in support of the VSAM Program. Our primary goal is to develop technologies so a user can interactively visualize and virtually modify a 3D environment from a set of images. Current approaches are described for image-based scene rendering, scene manipulation, and appearance modeling.

Reference-contexts: The method synthesizes images corresponding to new viewpoints by performing simple image warping operations. This work extends to perspective projection our earlier results <ref> [ Seitz and Dyer, 1995 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: A third requirement is scalability| the capability for combining an arbitrary number of basis views, with corresponding improvements in the quality of the synthesized views. With these requirements in mind, we are developing a new approach, called voxel coloring <ref> [ Seitz and Dyer, 1997a, Seitz and Dyer, 1997b ] </ref> , that reconstructs the "color" (radiance) at points in an unknown scene.

Reference-contexts: We call this plenoptic image editing <ref> [ Seitz and Kutulakos, 1997 ] </ref> because the user can edit any one image and those changes are propagated automatically, in a physically-consistent way, to all other images as if the 3D environment had itself been modified.
