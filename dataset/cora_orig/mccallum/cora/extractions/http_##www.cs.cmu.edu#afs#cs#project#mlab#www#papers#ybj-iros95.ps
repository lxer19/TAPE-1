Title: On Computing Optimal Planar Grasps  
Address: Pittsburgh, PA 15213-3890  
Affiliation: The Robotics Institute Carnegie Mellon University  
Abstract: The quality of a grasp can often be measured as the magnitude within which any external wrench is resistible by "unit grasp force". In this paper, we present a numerical algorithm to compute the optimal grasp on a simple polygon, given contact forces of unit total magnitude. Forces are compared with torques over the radius of gyration of the polygon. We also address a grasp optimality criterion for resisting an adversary finger located possibly anywhere on the polygon boundary. The disparity between these two grasp optimality criteria are demonstrated by simulation with results advocating that grasps should be measured task-dependently. The paper assumes non-frictional contacts.

Reference-contexts: Grasp metrics also apply to the design of modu lar fixtures where round locators and clamps act as fingers to constrain parts. <ref> [3] </ref> describes an algorithm that, given an arbitrary polygonal part, enumerates all force-closure modular fixtures and then ranks them according to some user-specified quality measure.

Reference-contexts: To cope with this issue, we borrow an idea from <ref> [4] </ref> which compares a force with a torque over the radius of gyration of D. Hence we redefine w (p) = ( ^ n (p); p fi ^ n (p)=). If @D is not smooth, another subtlety arises for the boundary points where the normals are undefined.

Reference-contexts: The second metric, called M f , measures, under the same finger force constraint, the maximum external force applicable at the worst location on the shape boundary without breaking the grasp. It is known that a grasp optimal under one metric is usually not very good under another ([8], <ref> [5] </ref>). In a real task, the space of possible external wrenches is often reduced due to the task specification or the working environmental constraints. <p> Assuming non-frictional contacts, [14] offers an O (n 2 log n) algorithm to find a three-finger grasp on an n-gon to resist the maximum external force acting through the center of gravity in any direction. Note the definition of grasp metric M w also appear in <ref> [5] </ref> and [12] where the normalization of finger forces under L 1 and other metrics are also addressed. Optimal grasp algorithms are given in the first paper for two-jaw and three-jaw grippers to grasp polygons, in which case only finite number of good grasps need to be considered.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 6 The optimal grasp is attained on @P (i.e., one finger at a vertex) or on the skeleton of the cell complex C defined above. The proofs of the above theorems can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>. So far we have not been able to devise an algorithm to compute t fl due to the structural complexity of C.
