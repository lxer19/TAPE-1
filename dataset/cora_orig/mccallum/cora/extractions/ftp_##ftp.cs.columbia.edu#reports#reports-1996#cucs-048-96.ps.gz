Reference-contexts: Their set of polynomials, called surface scattering modes, is ordered with respect to angular resolution and automatically respects Helmholtz's reciprocity and (if desired) surface isotropy. The derivation uses the Zernike circle polynomials <ref> [2] </ref> that form a complete basis for functions on the interior of the unit disk. <p> Positive values of l correspond to cosine terms, negative values to sine terms: G l () = cos (l) for l 0 (10) The functions R l n are closely related to Jacobi's polynomials <ref> [2] </ref> and are given by R l (nl)=2 X (1) s (n s)!t n2s : (11) Helmholtz reciprocity expresses the fact that, in the approximation of geometrical optics, the direction of light rays may be reversed. Therefore, the BRDF does not change when the entrance and exit beams are interchanged.

Reference-contexts: Many of the problems associated with traditional texture mapping and bump-mapping techniques are described in [10]. If the exact geometry of the surface is known, ray tracing can be used but at a high computational cost. Other methods of rendering surface texture include cellular texturing <ref> [5] </ref> which models the surface geometry with synthesized cells, and solid texturing ([17],[19],[18],[12],[22]) which combines a volumetric texture synthesis with volume rendering techniques. Both of these methods are also computationally intensive and both methods are applicable for a limited variety of textures.

Reference-contexts: Our BRDF parameter database, obtained by fitting the measurements to the Oren-Nayar model and the Koenderink et al. decomposition, can be used in place of the popular Lambertian reflectance model in such algorithms as shape-from-shading <ref> [7] </ref> and photometric stereo [30]. Since these algorithms rely on a reflectance model to ascertain shape, inaccuracies of the Lambertian model can significantly affect their performance.

Reference-contexts: Our large database allows us to evaluate the performance of known models. Specifically, the measurements are fit to two existing analytical representations: the Oren-Nayar model [15] for surfaces with isotropic roughness and the Koenderink et al. decomposition <ref> [9] </ref> for both anisotropic and isotropic surfaces. Our fitting results form a concise BRDF parameter database that is also publicly available. These BRDF parameters can be directly used for both image analysis and image synthesis. <p> A key benefit of this model is that it has only three unknown parameters: , and k d . 16 5.2 Koenderink et al. Representation In order to interpolate BRDF data sets, a series development in terms of an orthonormal basis can be used. Koenderink et al. <ref> [9] </ref> have shown how to construct such a complete, orthonormal basis on the Cartesian product of the hemisphere. Their set of polynomials, called surface scattering modes, is ordered with respect to angular resolution and automatically respects Helmholtz's reciprocity and (if desired) surface isotropy.

Reference-contexts: Bump-mapping preserves some of the appearance of roughness, but knowledge of the surface shape is required and shadows from the local surface relief are not rendered. Many of the problems associated with traditional texture mapping and bump-mapping techniques are described in <ref> [10] </ref>. If the exact geometry of the surface is known, ray tracing can be used but at a high computational cost. <p> The orientation change in the spectrum is due to the change of source direction which causes a change in the shadow direction. for by common texture-mapping techniques. A detailed discussion of the pitfalls of current texture rendering schemes is given in <ref> [10] </ref>. Consider the same sample shown under two different sets of illumination and viewing directions in Figure 11. The corresponding Fourier spectra are also shown in Figure 11. Notice that the spectra are quite different. <p> The database presented here is a starting point for further exploration into this area. 5 Fitting to BRDF Models A concise description is required for functional utility of the measurements. We employ the Oren-Nayar model [15] and the Koenderink et al. representation <ref> [10] </ref> to obtain parametric descriptions of the BRDF measurement database. The resulting database of parameters can be used directly and conveniently in a variety of algorithms where accurate, concise and analytical reflectance descriptions are needed. In vision, these applications include shape-from-shading and photometric stereo.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, the rendered velvet sphere gives a convincing impression of velvet. The rendered sphere of plaster shows a fairly flat appearance which is quite different from the Lambertian prediction for such matte objects, but is consistent with <ref> [14] </ref> and [15]. Sample 35, a collection of spheres painted with highly specular paint, show a similar flatness due to surface roughness. Compare sample 35 with sample 25 (quarry tile) which is a smoother sample that is only slightly specular.

Reference-contexts: As illustrated in Figure 10 and Figure 11, surface roughness causes notable effects on the BTF which are not considered by current texture algorithms. Present algorithms for shape-from-texture [16],[23],[11], texture segmentation [31],[11] and texture recognition <ref> [20] </ref> are only suitable for 2D textures, i.e. planar texture due to albedo variation. Texture analysis of real-world rough surfaces remains an important unsolved problem.

Reference-contexts: Notice that interchanging the source and viewing direction does not change the the ratio of radiance (L d ) to irradiance (E 0 cos i ), indicating that this model obeys Helmholtz's reciprocity condition. To account for specular reflection, the Torrance-Sparrow model <ref> [25] </ref> is incorporated so that the total radiance L is given by L ( r ; i ; r i ; ; ) = k d L d + k s L s ; (5) where L s is determined by the Torrance-Sparrow model, k d and k s are the

Reference-contexts: Although BRDF models have been widely discussed and used in vision (see [13],[24],[29],[9],[15]) the BRDFs of a large and diverse collection of macroscopically rough, real-world surfaces have never before been obtained 1 . Our measurement procedure does not employ a gonioreflectometer or the hemispherical mirror arrangement described in <ref> [27] </ref>. Instead, a robotic manipulator and CCD camera are employed to allow simultaneous measurement of the BTF and the BRDF of large samples (about 10x10cm). Our BRDF measurements comprise a comprehensive database (the first of its kind) for macroscopically rough surfaces that is now publicly available.
