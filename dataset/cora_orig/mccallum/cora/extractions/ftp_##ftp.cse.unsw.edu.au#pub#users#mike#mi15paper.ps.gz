Abstract: This paper describes recent experiments in automatically contruct-ing reactive agents. The method used is behavioural cloning, where the logged data from skilled, human operators are input to an induction program which outputs a control strategy for a complex control task. Initial studies were able to successfully construct such be-havioural clones, but suffered from several drawbacks, namely, that the clones were brittle and difficult to understand. Current research is aimed at solving these problems by learning in a framework where there is a separation between an agent's goals and its knowledge of how to achieve them.

Reference-contexts: To manufacture competitively however, it is important to react rapidly to changes in the manufacturing environment, using current shop floor status so as to minimise the effects of disruptions <ref> (Kerr & Kibira, 1994) </ref>. Kerr and Kibira have developed a reactive scheduler for a telephone man ufacturing plant using behavioural cloning of a skilled human scheduler.

Reference-contexts: Complex control skills in humans are built of components which their possessors cannot explicitly communicate. However, given sufficient sampling of subarticulate input-output, machine learning programs can construct rules which result in behaviours similar to those of the original exemplars <ref> (Michie, 1986) </ref>. These "clones", i.e. exemplar-derived agents, are in effect, symbolic representations of subsymbolic behaviours. In this paper, we first review three systems which have employed "be-havioural cloning" in diverse application domains.

Reference-contexts: However, for complex control tasks the use of "classical" behavioural cloning presents problems (Urbancic and Bratko, 1994). What is perhaps worse, the successful execution by a clone of even a relatively simple control task can result in behaviour which appears "mindless" <ref> (Michie, 1995) </ref>. To address these shortcomings we have re-formulated behavioural cloning within the following framework. A controller comprises an effects level and a goals level. Both levels are based on theories built by inductive learning from the traces of skilled operators.

Reference-contexts: In execution the two levels are linked as follows to control the system. We assume a circuit semantics <ref> (Nilsson, 1994) </ref> for the continuous evaluation of system inputs, though as in Nilsson's work in practice our experiments rely on sampling sensor values at some "fast" rate. Following each sample the state-vector is updated.

Reference-contexts: When a control action is performed, the action is output, along with the state of the simulation as it was some time before. How much earlier is determined by the size of the 6 buffer. 2.1.2 Data Analysis Quinlan's C4.5 <ref> (Quinlan, 1993) </ref> program was used to generate flight rules from the data. Even though induction programs can save an enormous amount of human effort in analysing data, in real applications it is usually necessary for the user to spend some time preparing the data.

Reference-contexts: Note that only one trace is required for the 30 GRAIL method compared with thirty for the traditional method, although the total number of examples used are of the same order of magnitude. This is due to the different sampling schemes employed. In <ref> (Sammut et al., 1992) </ref> an example was recorded only when the pilot changed the setting of one of the four control variables. In contrast, due the requirement of building an effects model for the GRAIL method, a fixed rate sampling scheme is employed.

Reference-contexts: Standard machine learning algorithms for classification are used. Reactive control is then implemented by using the induced theory to partition the state-space, classifying each region in terms of the action typically applied by a skilled operator. However, for complex control tasks the use of "classical" behavioural cloning presents problems <ref> (Urbancic and Bratko, 1994) </ref>. What is perhaps worse, the successful execution by a clone of even a relatively simple control task can result in behaviour which appears "mindless" (Michie, 1995). To address these shortcomings we have re-formulated behavioural cloning within the following framework.
