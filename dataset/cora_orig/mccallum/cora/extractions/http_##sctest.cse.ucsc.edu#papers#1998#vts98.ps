Title: A Study on the Utility of Using Expected Quality Level as a Design for Testability Metric  
Author: Douglas Williams F. Joel Ferguson Tracy Larrabee 
Abstract: This paper develops a Physical Design for Test (PDFT) metric that is directly related to the expected quality level (QL) contribution of a cell to a circuit, and it details experimental results showing the usefulness of this metric in predicting the quality level contribution of a cell to circuits that have yet to be designed. The PDFT metric shows what QL increase can be expected for the circuit by changing the physical design of a component of the circuit.

The probability that a fault f with weighted critical area WCA f occurs is 1 e WCA f , when the defect densities are uniform 1 . <p> The method suggested by Jee and Ferguson [7] divides its work accordingly (Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: This formulation of QL for non-equiprobable faults has been set forth previously by Corsi et al. <ref> [3] </ref>. In that paper the term elementary yield (Y f ) is applied to what we here represent by p (O f ). To show the cell dependence of QL, the above product will be broken into factors by cell type and fault type.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The purpose of physical design for test (PDFT) is to allow IC manufacturers to increase the quality of a shipped product; more formally, to increase the quality level, the fraction of shipped circuits that are fault-free. Traditional approaches to improving quality level have focused on ease-of-detection <ref> [4, 5, 11, 13] </ref>, but the likelihood of occurrence of potential faults is also important: Physical design for test addresses both of these factors. PDFT entails modifying the physical layout of a circuit in order to shift the distribution of faults toward those having a greater chance of being detected.

Reference-contexts: Since many design environments reuse logic units (those using standard cells or gate arrays, for example) and since faults internal to a cell can account for a significant percentage of circuit faults <ref> [6] </ref>, PDFT of the logical units or cells is an efficient means for quality level enhancement. <p> expression relating WCA to fault occur rence probability, q C;1 may be written q C;1 = t2S (C) U t = t2S (C) WCA t I C t2S (C) WCA t U t For small values of the exponent, this is the same as the metric developed in by Jee <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. 4 Tools and method for PDFT Previous work described a system for computing the metric described above for a given test environment [6]: This section provides a brief summary of the tools and methods necessary to present our new metric. <p> t I C t2S (C) WCA t U t For small values of the exponent, this is the same as the metric developed in by Jee [6, 7]. 4 Tools and method for PDFT Previous work described a system for computing the metric described above for a given test environment <ref> [6] </ref>: This section provides a brief summary of the tools and methods necessary to present our new metric.

Reference-contexts: Our PDFT methodology for logical units in a circuit requires information that can be obtained from the circuit topology, the physical design of the cell, and from the various components of the test environment <ref> [7] </ref>. This information can be used to develop a fl When this work was performed, Doug Williams was with the Department of Computer Engineering, UCSC. His current address is Hewlett-Packard Company, 1501 Page Mill Road MS 6UI, Palo Alto CA 94304. <p> For cell PDFT, a good metric would be an estimation of the cell's contribution to the quality level of a circuit in which the cell will be used. The work of Jee and Ferguson <ref> [7] </ref> describes the PDFT methodology we are using, but we modify it by including the expected change in the quality level of circuits for which this PDFT method is used. <p> expression relating WCA to fault occur rence probability, q C;1 may be written q C;1 = t2S (C) U t = t2S (C) WCA t I C t2S (C) WCA t U t For small values of the exponent, this is the same as the metric developed in by Jee <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. 4 Tools and method for PDFT Previous work described a system for computing the metric described above for a given test environment [6]: This section provides a brief summary of the tools and methods necessary to present our new metric. <p> The original metric consists of a sum of products (in the exponent), the factors of which may be viewed as characterizing the circuit topology and fault types ( U t I C ) and the cell's physical design (WCA t ). The method suggested by Jee and Ferguson <ref> [7] </ref> divides its work accordingly (Figure 1). Carafe [1] and CShort 3 [2] are used for cell characterization, while Nemesis [10] is used to characterize the circuit. <p> Meanwhile, Nemesis performs fault simulation on the specified circuit for a set of faults that we call single pattern faults (SPFs). (These have been referred to as single input pattern pseudo faults <ref> [7] </ref>.) The test vectors used by Nemesis constitute another portion of the testing environment. In our case, Nemesis was used in its single stuck-at ATPG mode to produce the test vectors. The information derived from these computations can be combined to produce the metric.
