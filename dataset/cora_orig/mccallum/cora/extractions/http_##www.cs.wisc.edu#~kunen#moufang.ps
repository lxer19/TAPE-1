Abstract: x1. Introduction. A quasigroup is a system (G; ) such that G is a non-empty set and is a binary function on G satisfying 8xz9!y(xy = z) and 8yz9!x(xy = z). A loop is a quasigroup which has an identity element, 1, satisfying 8x(x1 = 1x = x). Quasigroups are studied not only in algebra, but also in combinatorics, where they are identified with Latin squares, and in projective geometry, where they are identified with 3-webs. For details and references to earlier literature, see the books [1, 2]. By results of Bol and Bruck (see [1], p. 115), the following four identities: are equivalent in loops; a loop satisfying these identities is called a Moufang loop. The purpose of this note is to show that every quasigroup satisfying any one of these identities is a loop (Theorems 2.2, 2.3), so that in fact these are equivalent in quasigroups. Observe that equations M 1; M 2 are mirrors of each other; that is, M 2 is obtained by writing M 1 backwards. Likewise, N 1; N 2 are mirrors of each other. Actually, [1] does not mention M 2 explicitly, and just proves that M 1; N 1; N 2 are equivalent, but any proof of M 1 , N 1 has a mirror which proves that M 2 , N 2. are mirrors of each other, but, by an example of Zassenhaus (see [2], p. 46), there are 8-element loops satisfying one of these but not the other. In a quasigroup, equation RBOL implies that there is a left identity element ([3] and Theorem 2.1); so, taking the mirror, LBOL implies that there is a right identity, so that every quasigroup satisfying both RBOL and LBOL is a loop. However, by Robinson [6], there are non-loop quasigroups (G; ffi) satisfying RBOL but not LBOL; for example, let G be any field of characteristic other than 2, and let x ffi y = y x.

Reference-contexts: Proofs. We provide proofs for the three implications mentioned in x1. The first two are quite short. The first was given by Choudhury <ref> [3] </ref> in 1948, and we suspect that the second was also noticed before. We have not succeeded in finding a short proof of the third. 2.1. Theorem.([3]) Every quasigroup satisfying RBOL has a left identity. Proof. Fix any element a; then fix an e such that ea = a.

Reference-contexts: OTTER can prove theorems in full first-order logic, but it has been particularly useful in equational reasoning, where it can investigate substitutions much faster than a person can. Its proofs are long sequences of equations, and at first sight seem a bit inscrutable. However, as we showed in <ref> [4] </ref>, by examining these proofs and trying different formulations of the input, one can often produce proofs which a person can easily verify by hand; we have done this in obtaining our proofs in x2. x2. Proofs. We provide proofs for the three implications mentioned in x1.
