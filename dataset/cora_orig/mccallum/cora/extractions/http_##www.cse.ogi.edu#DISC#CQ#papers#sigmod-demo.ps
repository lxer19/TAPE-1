Reference-contexts: Comparing with the pure pull (such as DBMSs, various web search engines) and pure push (such as Pointcast, Marimba, Broadcast disks <ref> [1] </ref>) technology, the CQ project can be seen as a hybrid approach that combines the pull and push technology by supporting personalized update monitoring through a combined client-pull and server-push paradigm. fl This research is partially supported by DARPA contract MDA972-97-1-0016, Intel, and Boeing. 1 2 Overview The goal of the

The key components of CQ evaluator include: the query router [5, 3], the query planner <ref> [2, 4] </ref> and the query result assembler. The query router is a key technology that enables the CQ system to scale in order to handle thousands of different information sources.

Reference-contexts: The CQ project at OGI, funded by DARPA, aims at developing a scalable toolkit and techniques for update monitoring and event-driven information delivery on the net. The main feature of the CQ project is a "personalized update monitoring" toolkit based on continual queries <ref> [6] </ref>. In contrast to conventional database queries, continual queries are standing queries that are issued once and run "continually" over the source data.
