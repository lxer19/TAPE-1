Abstract: Diamond Park is a social virtual reality system in which multiple geographically separated users can speak to each other and participate in joint activities. The central theme of the park is cycling. Human visitors to the park are represented by 3D animated avatars and can explore a square mile of 3D terrain. In addition to human visitors, the park hosts a number of computer simulations including tour buses and autonomous animated figures. Diamond Park is implemented using a software platform called Spline, which makes it easy to build virtual worlds where multiple people interact with each other and computer simulations in a 3D visual and audio environment. Spline performs all the processing necessary to maintain a distributed, modifiable, and extendable model of a virtual world that is shared between the participants.

Reference-contexts: To prevent this, Spline breaks the world model up into many small chunks called locales <ref> (Barrus, Waters & Anderson, 1996) </ref> and communicates information about a given locale only to the small number of users that are near enough to that locale to be interested in it. <p> Another common problem experienced in virtual worlds is the need to move an avatar or other object along the surface of the ground, while avoiding fixed obstacles. To support this, Spline provides a general terrain following facility <ref> (Barrus & Waters, 1996) </ref>. Given any 3D point, this facility can determine the height of the `ground' below a query point and whether a collision with a fixed obstacle is occurring in only a few microseconds. <p> Spline shares this last feature with NPSNET (Macedonia et al., 1994; 1995) (http://www-npsnet.cs.nps.navy.mil/npsnet/) but as dis MERL-TR-96-02a November, 1996 16 Diamond Park cussed in <ref> (Barrus, Waters & Anderson, 1996) </ref>, Spline's `locales' are more flexible than the `areas of interest' in NPSNET. In Spline 3.0 we have diverged further from DIS. We have adopted a different strategy for object state messages that is built on the Scalable Reliable Multicast protocol (Floyd, Jacobson & Weinmayr). <p> In particular, designing what should happen in Diamond Park took approximately a man-year of effort and constructing the 3D visual models consumed another 8 months. Designing the soundscape and creating the appropriate prerecorded sounds required a few months of effort. The concept of locales in Spline <ref> (Barrus, Waters & Anderson, 1996) </ref> had a fundamental impact on the design of Diamond Park in two ways. First, by partitioning the park into sections that are handled separately, locales allow the park to be much more complex than it otherwise could be.

Reference-contexts: However, given the rapid pace of development of graphics accelerator boards, this should be possible soon. 3.9 Related Platforms To achieve scalability to large numbers of users, Spline adopts the basic approach pioneered by SIMNET <ref> (Calvin, et al., 1993) </ref> and DIS (Standard, 1993) namely the realization that achieving real-time performance in a scalable distributed system requires giving up on having a completely consistent view of the world model throughout the entire system.

Reference-contexts: In general, MUDs are primarily text based using at most simple 2D graphics. However, they support large numbers of interacting users. At the forefront of research on MUDs, the Jupiter system <ref> (Curtis & Nichols, 1994) </ref> adds support for live audio and video, but not 3D graphics. In the course of his work on Jupiter, it was Pavel Curtis who coined the term `social virtual reality'. Recently, a number of systems have appeared that extend MUDs into the realm of 3D graphics.

Reference-contexts: To do this, we relied on ideas from many sources including landscape design and town planning, see Greenbie (1981) and Wylson & Wylson (1994). The layout of Diamond Park was inspired by the landscape parks created in the 18th and 19th centuries by Humphrey Repton and Frederick Law Olmsted <ref> (Fabos, Milde & Weinmayr, 1968) </ref>. In these parks, the deliberate planning of views, the mixture of wooded and open space, and a combination of man-made and natural features help draw the visitor through the physical setting.

In CyberCampus, users interact in a simple 3D world featuring live audio and 2 Hz video. The Community Place browser and CyberPark support multiple people in a shared 3D graphical environment with background sounds but no live audio.

Reference-contexts: In addition, they are intended for staging preplanned exercises, rather than supporting an evolving on-line community. The second line of multi-user virtual environments began with the multi-user dungeon games (MUDs) that became popular at universities in the 70's and 80's and have matured through systems like LucasFilm's Habitat <ref> (Morningstar & Farmer, 1991) </ref> and become common in the form of chat rooms on various on-line services. In general, MUDs are primarily text based using at most simple 2D graphics. However, they support large numbers of interacting users.

Reference-contexts: A final line of development relevant to Diamond Park is other virtual environments designed specifically for bicycling. In 1989, the Cyberia team at AutoDesk created a PC-based virtual world for bicycling <ref> (see pages 188-189 in Rheingold, 1991) </ref>. Seated on a stationary bicycle called the HiCycle, a user could explore a varied 3D terrain. Currently, Tectrix (http://www.tectrix.com/products/VRBike/VR Bike.html) and RacerMate (http://www. wsmith.com/velolinq/racemate/race3.htm) produce commercial systems of a similar flavor, using PC's and Nintendo game consoles, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Community Place (Lea, Honda & Matsuda, in press) has adopted a hybrid client-server/ peer-to-peer approach where servers partition the world spatially and establish multicast groups to support those partitions. They have been studying how to apply different models of distributed consistency to distributed virtual environments. In BrickNet <ref> (Singh, et al., 1994) </ref> servers manage the communication between clients while also acting as object request brokers. Clients "own" their objects, but may "lease" some of their capabilities to other clients. Depending on the circumstances, leasing may be read-only, or may allow modification.

Reference-contexts: As in formal gardens, a number of meeting places such as the Central Plaza were created in Diamond Park. The potentially alienating nature of a virtual experience led to the decision to design Diamond Park's buildings as iconic representations of familiar architecture <ref> (Venturi, Scott Brown & Izenour, 1977) </ref>. A range of building styles appear throughout the park, each serving a specific purpose. Major public buildings such as the Orientation Center and Museum are based on neoclassical models.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, we at MERL are interested in returning to an investigation of novel applications. In this regard, it is worthy of note that Spline 1.5 has been used to support two other significant applications in addition to Diamond Park. As described in <ref> (Walker & Torres, 1995) </ref>, Spline 1.5 forms the basis for a multi-user drama system called VIVA (for Virtual Interaction with Virtual Actors). In VIVA human users perform some of the roles in a play and a computer simulation performs the rest.
