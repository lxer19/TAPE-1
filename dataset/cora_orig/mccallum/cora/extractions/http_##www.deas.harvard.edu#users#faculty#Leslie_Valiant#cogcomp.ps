Abstract: Cognitive computation is discussed as a discipline that links together neurobiology, cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence.

Reference-contexts: Accurate timing permeates this style of implementation of random access tasks. (Correspondingly accurate timing, to within submillisecond accuracy over ranges of over 100 milliseconds, has been observed <ref> [1] </ref>. Global synchronization and oscillatory phenomena more generally in cortex have been widely observed [6].

Reference-contexts: In order to do this but to keep its computational complexity under control some device such as an image is useful. (Analogous devices have been suggested by several authors before in the context of cognitive modeling, such as the "working memory" of <ref> [2] </ref>.) 5 Maximalist Cognitive Models Once some plausible characteristics have been identified it is reasonable to ask what classes of computations of this character are computationally feasible in general, independent of the constraints of the brain itself.

Reference-contexts: In [9] a framework for investigating this is outlined for this larger class of functionalities under the umbrella term rationality. The interest there is in defining rational behavior in a complex world that is too difficult to model (analogous to agnostic learning <ref> [3] </ref>) and in which the entity has no single determining goal. In this rationality framework the relationship between the internal representation of knowledge and the outside reality, if any, is essentially that of pac learning.

Reference-contexts: Pac learning is therefore a basic paradigm that is included. To capture basic reasoning processes simple syllogisms are incorporated also. A third paradigm is learning to reason <ref> [4] </ref>. In addition certain probabilistic reasoning processes as well as planning functions can be incorporated. It is hoped that by combining a limited number of such functionalities, the phenomenon of rational commonsense behavior in a complex world can be captured in a unified manner.

Reference-contexts: This is crucial both for short term dynamics i.e. executing algorithms, as well as for longer term memory.

Reference-contexts: small percentage of connections between neurons in cortex that are concerned with cognitive random access tasks are strong, in the sense that the firing of the presynaptic cell alone is sufficient to cause the postsynaptic cell to fire. (There is some recent direct evidence for the existence of such connections <ref> [7] </ref>, and some further indirect evidence that some pairs of cells have highly correlated behavior. The average connection, however, is known to be very weak.) (b) Neurons retain information not only in the synaptic strengths (long term potentiation) but also as state information more global to the neuron.

Reference-contexts: The hope is that these dual constraints are strong enough that any solutions found will yield some nontrivial insights into the specific character of cognitive computations, and therefore that the study can then advance to the next level. This is the strategy followed in <ref> [8] </ref>, where implementations of such a minimalist cognitive model on a certain neuroidal model are explored. The basic aspects of the cognitive model used there can be summarized as follows. At any time the entity has a number of items x 1 ; ; x t that it can recognize. <p> It is found that implementing just the first of these tasks, namely memorization, is already a challenging task, and it is not surprising perhaps that there is still no generally agreed theory of how the brain accomplishes even this. 3 Biological Predictions The implementations given in <ref> [8] </ref> follow in the main generally agreed facts about the nature of mammalian, and in particular, human cortex. Since such assumptions by themselves apparently do not readily lead to theories that explain cognition, on some points some additional biological assumptions are used. <p> The implementations given in <ref> [8] </ref> do appear to provide such constraints. They suggest a character to cognitive computations that is somewhat distinctive from alternative approaches.
